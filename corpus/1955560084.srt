1
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,440
Want a piece?

2
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,701
Katie's sister, she's
coming for Christmas.

3
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,839
Her husband is this big-shot
plumber, always buying her jewellery,

4
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,541
but her sister is
always showing it off

5
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,495
and throwing it on
Katie's face, you know?

6
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,751
Well, guess what?

7
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,534
It's payback time.

8
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,876
Almost two karats.

9
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,423
From Zambia.

10
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,387
That's why there's a yellow.

11
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,250
See the yellow?

12
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:12,956
Yellow's good.

13
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:15,466
Beautiful.

14
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:18,396
I hate that dick.

15
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,103
That's him.

16
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,127
Damn! He's on the move!

17
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,669
Cut him on the way!

18
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,221
Get out of the van now!

19
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,019
John, get out of the way!

20
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,687
Breen, I'm all right.

21
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,356
You're OK?

22
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,740
I'm good.

23
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,168
Officer down, Starvil 252.

24
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,040
Stay there.

25
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:09,857
Oh, shit.

26
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,233
Fight it.

27
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,306
Fight it.

28
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,223
Look at me. Fight it.

29
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:21,341
You gotta go.

30
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:23,861
You gotta...

31
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:37,001
Thirty days modified duty?

32
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,183
It's a long time to be off the job.

33
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,719
Yeah?

34
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,998
But the doctor cleared
me for return, so...

35
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,076
I'm not talking about your arm, John.

36
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,027
Put in your twenty.

37
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:49,392
More pension.

38
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:51,445
If I was you, I'd hang it up.

39
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:52,789
See?

40
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:54,716
Good as new.

41
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,448
Like I said, just making sure.

42
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,961
No, no, finish your drink.

43
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,571
- Relax.
- Thanks.

44
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,137
Teena McGuire.

45
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,241
Her husband worked for Good Year.

46
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,813
Lay-off hits, four or five years ago?

47
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,249
Boom! Cancer.

48
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,407
No insurance, six year old girl.

49
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,390
The guy's gone in two months.

50
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,415
Hey!

51
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,018
Hey babe! What is it?

52
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,979
Hey Brad, you got a job yet?

53
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,818
There's food in there.

54
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:42,461
Make it!

55
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:45,237
OK, wait til I come
home and I'll make it.

56
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,486
- No, no-one's going home.
- I gotta go.

57
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,048
- I gotta go.
- No you don't! - Yeah.

58
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,099
This is our night!

59
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,359
- Come on.
- I can't.

60
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:52,432
One drink!

61
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,641
- One.
- Alright.

62
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,829
Still love you.

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,190
What are you gonna do?

64
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,837
Her boyfriend is going
over the Falls tonight.

65
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,503
The dick that barfed the
beer on our car.

66
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,673
Oh God! I wish that were true!

67
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:11,007
My mum took Bethie to the movies.

68
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,821
One night.

69
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:15,835
One...

70
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,955
night.

71
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,321
Free from the hell of fourth
grade math and I get ditched.

72
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,097
Gosh! Sure, why not?

73
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,253
Thanks for asking.

74
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:28,780
I'm Marteen McGuire.

75
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,580
Friends call me Teena.

76
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,364
Now you say your name.

77
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:35,010
John Dromoor.

78
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,049
Is this girl a psychic?

79
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,361
Nah!

80
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:42,961
I don't meet a lot

81
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,309
of real life heroes.

82
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,441
Seriously.

83
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:49,858
It's an honor.

84
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,001
That was back in April.

85
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:55,207
Yeah, sure, a whole month ago.

86
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,544
Who remembers?

87
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,208
You...

88
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,321
Crooked smile.

89
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,370
I like that.

90
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,559
Let's get another drink.

91
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:11,871
No, no!

92
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:13,735
I got this.

93
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:16,546
Mike!

94
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,948
Hey, man. Two more.

95
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,316
My mum wants us to move in with her.

96
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:31,719
Marteen! Lung cancer, the cigarette!

97
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:34,859
Marteen! A ten-year old needs stability.

98
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:38,838
Yeah, we would save money, but...

99
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,571
I don't know, we're doing OK.

100
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,498
Pretty stable.

101
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:46,105
Jesus! Living with my mother?

102
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,010
Could be worse.

103
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,434
Hey, yikes!

104
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:52,265
I gotta go pick her up.

105
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,213
You know, you could, erm...

106
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:00,623
You could call me... if you want.
You're a good listener.

107
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:03,165
We'll have to work on the talking part.

108
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,296
- I'd like to.
- Yeah, me too.

109
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:07,883
I want you to know...

110
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,384
You're gonna shut me
down just like that?

111
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,129
No, I'm kidding... I'm kidding.

112
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:13,207
No, erm...

113
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,308
I'm...

114
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:15,373
I'm a...

115
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,385
a widower.

116
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,861
So, we understand each other.

117
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:24,990
Maybe so.

118
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,459
John Dromoor.

119
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:35,125
My new friend.

120
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:00,676
What's up?

121
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,333
Hey!

122
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,879
Hey, Teena!

123
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:12,904
Hey!

124
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,228
This is amazing!

125
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,668
You have a barbecue?

126
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,532
Bethie, you're missing it.

127
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,704
Don't let your mum see you.

128
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:33,882
It's fine.

129
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,474
She also didn't know

130
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:36,534
I snuck this.

131
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,996
You little thief.

132
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,347
Look at that!

133
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:55,233
It's awesome.

134
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,386
I like the rain-bow.

135
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,650
Seriously?

136
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,452
No.

137
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,477
I'm good.

138
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,312
Butt-head.

139
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:19,344
How long's your mum
been seeing Casey?

140
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:21,962
I don't know.

141
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,438
A while, I guess?

142
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,706
I can see why he likes her.

143
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,728
Bethie?

144
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:37,701
Bethel Anne McGuire, you get down
right now or you'll break your neck!

145
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:40,447
Now, damn it! I got this now!

146
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,900
Mum! I'm not gonna fall!

147
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:44,649
Bethie! Now! Thank you, Casey!
I have this!

148
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,739
Now!

149
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,834
Jesus! What am I, five?

150
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:09,727
Hey.

151
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:11,836
Last piece? Saved it just for you.

152
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,882
- Hmmm.
- It's mine.

153
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,237
I can't.

154
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,349
You're right.

155
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,578
You'll let the ice-cream
melting to the crust.

156
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,681
I'm sorry I yelled.

157
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,365
Hey, handsome!

158
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,467
Ain't no kiss?

159
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:53,440
Bethie, baby,

160
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:54,801
time to be back.

161
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,812
It's late, why don't you
guys just stay over?

162
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:57,932
Come on, Case.

163
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,352
I got some Sponge Bobs
loaded on the iPad.

164
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,871
Bethie hasn't seen him.

165
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,180
I ain't done with you
but it's a long shot.

166
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:05,687
I still got some moves.

167
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:07,020
We could stay, mum.

168
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:08,660
See? Gotta load it.

169
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,070
We have breakfast at
Grandma's, 8 AM sharp.

170
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:12,800
- Are you sure?
- Hmm.

171
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,023
- They're playing our song.
- Again?

172
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,149
I'll run you home.

173
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,417
No, we're gonna walk. You
shouldn't drink and drive.

174
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,484
It's late! Come on, I'll
take you in five minutes.

175
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,077
It's a beautiful night.

176
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,445
Tuesday she's at my mum's, don't forget.

177
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,211
Call you in the morning.

178
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,879
Oh, no.

179
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,301
Oh, Mike's telling this dream...

180
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,089
I'd love to...

181
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,058
Oh no, really?

182
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:44,800
Why is my purse so heavy?

183
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:46,514
Hey?

184
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,827
Must be sweet having such a great mum.

185
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,901
You know, when you were a baby

186
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,969
your father used to take you out
on long walks around here.

187
00:12:57,592 --> 00:13:00,165
You always took your dolls.
You had to have them.

188
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,344
I hate dolls.

189
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:05,397
Hey.

190
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:07,629
Sweetie?

191
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,991
Wait!

192
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,553
Bethie.

193
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,919
What is it? You don't mind
me talking about your Dad?

194
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:16,952
Actually,

195
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:20,530
I don't like you treating me... like

196
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:22,784
like I'm an infant.

197
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,590
I wasn't gonna fall, mum.

198
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:26,779
Honey...

199
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:27,844
Please.

200
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:29,537
Don't.

201
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:36,544
I can't remember.

202
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:39,102
Baby.

203
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,204
I can't remember what he looks like.

204
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,447
His face.

205
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:51,822
I try.

206
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,693
Really hard.

207
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,105
But he just goes away.

208
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,036
Like he was never there.

209
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,809
It's all right.

210
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,105
And...

211
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,366
When you least expect it...

212
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:15,186
Out of the blue...

213
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,006
There he is.

214
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,710
Hey.

215
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:24,718
None of this is just you.

216
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:28,053
Not your fault you couldn't remember.

217
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:31,899
Hey, honey.

218
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,706
I miss him too.

219
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,531
It's just how memory works.

220
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,283
Are you sure?

221
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:46,964
Cross my heart and hope to die.

222
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,562
You know what?

223
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,266
I know a short cut.

224
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:57,898
Come on.

225
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,510
Let's get you home.

226
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:05,724
Down here?

227
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:06,766
Yeah!

228
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,279
OK, his face is creepy.

229
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,337
Oh, he's fine!

230
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:11,002
He's been there since high school.

231
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:12,413
It is dark but...

232
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,549
- Mamma?
- Yeah?

233
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,954
Where are we?

234
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,007
You don't remember?

235
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,064
No.

236
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,092
You, me, your Dad...

237
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:32,054
We used to come out here, rent a canoe,

238
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,435
and go look at Niagara Falls.

239
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,128
- Really?
- Yeah!

240
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:37,642
Can we still rent one?

241
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:39,512
You know what? I'm not sure.

242
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,755
Maybe. I'll give them a
call in the morning.

243
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:43,888
That'll be fun.

244
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:44,908
Yeah.

245
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,800
Careful.

246
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:00,109
- This place is beautiful.
- Yeah?

247
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,375
- Oh, look! There's a mermaid.
- Yeah!

248
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,459
They call this place "Mermaid Cove".

249
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:07,151
I didn't know that.

250
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,795
I can't remember how it goes.

251
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,724
<i>♪ There once was a mermaid, ♪</i>

252
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,490
<i>♪ who lived by the pond, ♪</i>

253
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,088
<i>♪ who was very beautiful, ♪</i>

254
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,394
<i>♪ and very blond. ♪</i>

255
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:21,521
Teena McGuire.

256
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:25,211
Hey, it is Marvin Fick, remember me?
Of course you do.

257
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,484
You remember Teena McGuire?

258
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,729
- The cheerleader?
- The cheerleader, ha, ha!

259
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:32,051
What are you doing here?
Happy Independence Day!

260
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,083
Leave us alone.

261
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,460
Happy Independence Day!

262
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,227
Hey, come on, guys. Leave us alone.

263
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:37,979
What you guys doing? You wanna
stick around?

264
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,282
You wanna have a beer?

265
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,321
We got some smoke.

266
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,699
Oh my God, is this your daughter?

267
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,632
A handsome guy like you, you
gotta have a girlfriend.

268
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,148
You wouldn't wanna piss her off.

269
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,173
Leave us alone.

270
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:49,017
She won't mind, will she, Lloyd?

271
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,471
No, she won't mind.

272
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:51,721
Hey! No, no, no!

273
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:55,394
Bethie!

274
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,134
Get her! Get her!

275
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:02,506
Turn her in!

276
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:03,542
I got her legs.

277
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:08,615
Open the door!

278
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,088
Bethie!

279
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:12,978
Bethie!

280
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,348
Get in there! Get in there!

281
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:18,696
Get inside!

282
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:19,723
Get inside!

283
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:21,555
Bethie!

284
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:27,407
Come on!

285
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:29,348
Don't chase her, she's got no way to go.

286
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,593
Mammy!

287
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,184
Leave her alone, please!

288
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,466
Don't hurt her, please!

289
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,820
Please, don't hurt her, please!

290
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,530
Get off me!

291
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:24,638
Whooo!

292
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,047
Did we deceive her?

293
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:29,627
Let's go!!

294
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:30,649
I showed this bitch...

295
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,617
Happy Fourth of July!

296
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,565
Please, mom!

297
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,452
It's OK!

298
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:05,957
It's OK!

299
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:22,655
What's this?

300
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,019
Hey!

301
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,649
Call an ambulance!

302
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,047
NFPD!

303
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:43,750
DNA, fingerprints...

304
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,339
The only thing they didn't
leave were name tags.

305
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,295
I'll help her.

306
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,528
No, no, no, Ma'am, stay down, stay down!

307
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,047
Ma'am, you have to stay down.

308
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:44,717
The juvenile, they raped her too?

309
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:48,596
Mom!

310
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:50,864
Mom!

311
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:52,482
No, come back here. I'm sorry!

312
00:22:52,507 --> 00:22:55,188
I wanna see my mum!
You have to stay down here, I'm so sorry!

313
00:22:55,213 --> 00:22:56,335
Mom!

314
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:14,804
It's OK, it's OK.

315
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:17,078
It's OK. You're gonna be OK now.

316
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,047
I'm gonna go get you a brace.

317
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,379
He'll be down soon.

318
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:33,698
- No, I'm not waiting for the doctor.
- Ma'am...

319
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:34,997
Don't Ma'am me.

320
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,438
I wanna see my daughter.

321
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,947
I wanna see my girl.

322
00:23:40,313 --> 00:23:41,313
God damn it!

323
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:45,643
Oh God!

324
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:47,401
Oh, hey!

325
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,813
Hey, my little angel.

326
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:53,548
Hey, are you OK?

327
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:55,280
What did they do to you?

328
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,936
- I'm OK.
- Yeah?

329
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,424
- Promise?
- You promise, huh?

330
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,197
How's mamma?

331
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,526
She's fine,

332
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,919
because you and I are
gonna stick together.

333
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:10,566
And we're gonna make sure...

334
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:11,921
Mrs Kevecki,

335
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:13,354
Detective John Dromoor.

336
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:15,466
I'm with my grand-daughter.

337
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:18,306
Well, that's the thing, Ma'am. She
got a good look at those guys.

338
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,650
She's 12... she's 12 years old.

339
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:23,322
Her mum can't talk,
she's our only witness.

340
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,786
It's OK, baby, that's
all right, sweetheart.

341
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,444
Can you please wait?

342
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,673
I need your help.

343
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:39,014
Go! Go! NFPD!

344
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,007
Get down! Don't move!

345
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:42,285
Get down!

346
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,475
You can't come in here like...

347
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,281
Get your kids away!

348
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:48,980
Police! Don't make a move!

349
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:50,402
- What is this?
- Go!

350
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,189
Lloyd! Keep your mouth shut!

351
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,285
Get up!

352
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,997
Keep your mouth shut!

353
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:57,306
Get up!

354
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,406
Stay down!

355
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,966
What did I do? What did I do?

356
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,322
Walter, do something!

357
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:05,141
Do something! Oh, my God!

358
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:06,727
What is this?

359
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,052
Marvin!

360
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,992
I'm gonna call Father Muldoon!

361
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,070
Go! You're good?

362
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,180
Yes!

363
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,321
Stop!

364
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,431
Marvin, stop, police!

365
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,063
Where are you gonna go? Stop!

366
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,813
Stop running!

367
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:38,357
Stop!

368
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,807
One to seven.

369
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,937
One on this side.

370
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,347
Seven on the end.

371
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,819
There's nothing to be
afraid of, sweetie.

372
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:10,905
Hey, Bethie, you're gonna pick them out

373
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,387
and I'm gonna put him away
for a very long time.

374
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:14,993
They can't hurt you,

375
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,446
I won't let them.

376
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:17,809
OK?

377
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:21,900
The guy in the white eight top.

378
00:26:22,468 --> 00:26:23,468
Number two.

379
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:29,054
And the one right next to him.

380
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,866
And in the avant garde pants.

381
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,559
Three.

382
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:37,009
Five.

383
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:41,078
And seven.

384
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,244
That's them.

385
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,143
Numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7, step forward.

386
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:58,050
Marvin and Lloyd Fick.

387
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,022
Fritz Haaber.

388
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:01,549
Jimmy de Lucca.

389
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:41,339
Bethie, oh my God.

390
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:42,904
I'm so sorry.

391
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,376
It's OK.

392
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:45,926
She's gonna be fine.

393
00:27:46,596 --> 00:27:48,332
Her brain stem's good, so,

394
00:27:48,357 --> 00:27:49,802
unless one of them goes down.

395
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,526
They'll let her out.

396
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,315
Thanks for bringing lilies.

397
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:57,286
She loves them.

398
00:27:58,575 --> 00:27:59,575
Miss K.

399
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,747
Miss K., I came as soon as I heard.

400
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,308
Why?

401
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,266
Oh, what are you doing here?

402
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:08,687
Look, her color is better.

403
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,735
Did you forget the backpack in the car?

404
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,793
Ouch.

405
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:14,999
I got it, give here.

406
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,123
I parked just out front, sweetheart.

407
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:21,819
Sorry.

408
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,487
Marteen McGuire, new patient,
she came in last night?

409
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:46,653
Are you family?

410
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,313
Sir, are you family?

411
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,264
My favourite is Duffy Duck.

412
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:52,721
Mum needs you inside.

413
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,580
Oh, I need you to stop
looking like a whore.

414
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:59,252
Where are you going looking like that?

415
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:06,933
They couldn't have done this, Father.

416
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,452
They're good boys.

417
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:10,727
They didn't do it.

418
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:14,343
For those that truly love him,

419
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:17,830
God promises to make
things right and good.

420
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:20,087
If we do our job,

421
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:22,732
He keeps thy great promise.

422
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:25,043
As a good Christian parents,

423
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,421
what is your part?

424
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:30,386
Yes, Irma, we are all His children,

425
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,633
but until he calls us,

426
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:34,778
we live in this world.

427
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,411
Sometimes He sends an angel,

428
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,746
sometimes...

429
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:41,775
a messenger.

430
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,295
Your part...

431
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:47,732
is hiring the best criminal
lawyer you can find.

432
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:49,354
Who's gonna pay that bill?

433
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:51,096
God?

434
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:52,163
You hear that?

435
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:53,645
Times of trial...

436
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,338
Jay Kirkpatrick.

437
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,619
Sure, he'll charge an arm and a leg.

438
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,317
But he is your man.

439
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:07,372
He represented 18 cases for the Vatican.

440
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:12,540
But in this world, a factory
town with no more factories,

441
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:15,746
tourists are all that's left.

442
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,770
A gang-rape in a city park,

443
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,784
that's bad for business.

444
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,160
Jay Kirkpatrick.

445
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:30,561
Excuse me.

446
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:33,743
It's your mum,
honey, she's awake.

447
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:35,595
OK.

448
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,209
Mamma?

449
00:31:54,844 --> 00:31:55,844
Mamma?

450
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:00,604
Mamma?

451
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,128
She's the same.

452
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:06,819
Hey.

453
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:08,577
Hi baby.

454
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,338
It's Bethie and I.

455
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:13,305
We're here.

456
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:16,228
Hey.

457
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:20,588
Something happened.

458
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:21,990
It's OK, mamma.

459
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:23,657
The roof.

460
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
- No.
- I told you...

461
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,827
to get down.

462
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,430
No, mamma.

463
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,882
She doesn't remember.

464
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,744
It's OK, honey, she's...

465
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,048
She just woke up.

466
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,106
They have been in trouble before.

467
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:45,617
That McCormick girl?

468
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,008
Lying bitch.

469
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,920
She withdrew the whole complaint.

470
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:51,991
The police said they got
evidence, blood and DNA.

471
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:53,701
- Television.
- Really?

472
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,160
In a Jury trial,

473
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,041
there are two stories.

474
00:32:58,461 --> 00:33:01,341
The Jury picks the story
they like the best.

475
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:03,542
The story

476
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,930
and how you tell it,

477
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:07,929
that's all that matters.

478
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:10,316
So how much for your story?

479
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:15,118
I like that, cuts right to the chase.

480
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,271
850 an hour.

481
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,250
- 1250 in Court.
- Screw me.

482
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:22,847
That's against our $50,000
retainer fee for each boy.

483
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,363
We cannot do that!

484
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:26,424
Oh, yes, we can.

485
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:27,921
And we will.

486
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:34,616
Our house.

487
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:38,429
I worked 30 years to pay that off.

488
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:40,823
It's all that we got.

489
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,434
We're paying twice because
it's two sons, right?

490
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,383
Two clients.

491
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,914
But they're charged with the same crime.

492
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,215
So one story.

493
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:53,701
Jesus, Walt!

494
00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:56,837
Wait, it's like... a
woman has two babies.

495
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,003
They ain't twice as much work,
she does the same thing for both,

496
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,735
that's why she's got
two tits, right?

497
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:02,792
Can you believe this...?

498
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:04,069
It's OK.

499
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,380
Well now, Walt, wouldn't you have
made a damned fine attorney?

500
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:12,366
My point is...

501
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:16,625
maybe you could see your way clear
to giving us a discount here.

502
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:22,149
I understand your dilemma,
Walt, I really do.

503
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,025
See, I'm a father myself.

504
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:28,907
But sometimes, we're cast with
making difficult choices.

505
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,590
But we always want to do the right
for our kids, right or wrong.

506
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:36,231
We'll do anything to help them out,

507
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,202
spare them any pain.

508
00:34:39,654 --> 00:34:41,798
Trust me, you're doing the right thing.

509
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,599
Walt, listen to me.

510
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:49,345
You're paying me to keep
your sons out of jail.

511
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:51,786
So that they don't get raped.

512
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:54,647
Like that innocent woman.

513
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:04,631
Helen!

514
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:08,026
Draw up an engagement letter
for the Ficks, please.

515
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,551
Looks like someone might be
coming home real soon, huh?

516
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:25,054
The police came by today, they were...

517
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:26,878
asking about...

518
00:35:29,189 --> 00:35:30,850
walking Bethie home.

519
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:33,956
No.

520
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:36,588
They wanted to know if you could
maybe look at a few photographs,

521
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:38,353
in case you might
remember something.

522
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,619
I can't.

523
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:45,389
It's so weird, I can't
remember anything.

524
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:47,980
It's OK, it's OK.

525
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,710
No, no, no, it's OK.

526
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,446
The doc says this kind of
stuff comes back in time,

527
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,261
It's nothing to worry about.

528
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:56,581
This came for you while you were asleep.

529
00:35:56,606 --> 00:36:00,242
I gave her your mail to open it
but I said that's snooping.

530
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:03,690
No-one likes a snitch, Bethie.

531
00:36:07,538 --> 00:36:09,483
I didn't know you liked flowers.

532
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:12,902
I said I don't like cut flowers,
there's a difference.

533
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:15,279
Is there?

534
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:44,043
Mom, no, not in your house.

535
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:45,208
I don't wanna hear it.

536
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:46,754
It's OK, mamma.

537
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:51,664
We're not moving in,
I told her that, OK?

538
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:54,937
Jesus Christ.

539
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:57,699
Please, mamma, we need help.

540
00:36:58,668 --> 00:37:00,800
Just until you get a little bit better.

541
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:04,960
Grandma's time machine.

542
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:10,195
She keeps everything the same,
she would still treat me like I'm 16.

543
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:17,419
How are you doing?

544
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:19,510
Things could be worse.

545
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:25,364
Thank you.

546
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:30,170
You haven't touched your ice-cream?

547
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:35,015
I wasn't hungry, I guess.

548
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:37,317
For blueberry swirl?

549
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:39,484
Really?

550
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:44,208
Well, well, well, the girl is sick.

551
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:03,638
Sweetheart?

552
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:06,800
Listen to me.

553
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:12,212
Those animals aren't gonna...
come near us.

554
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,483
They've been warned.

555
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,756
They know where we live.

556
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:24,711
God! You're beautiful.

557
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:27,168
Help!

558
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,498
I've done this the first time.

559
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:35,337
Help me!

560
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:38,293
Help me!

561
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,039
Don't touch me!

562
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:14,923
It's OK.

563
00:39:15,043 --> 00:39:16,043
It's OK.

564
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:17,308
It's OK.

565
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:20,642
No. Why?

566
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:24,805
Why would they do that?

567
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,081
No, baby.

568
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:32,767
Oh, no.

569
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:34,066
Oh, no.

570
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,455
I'm so sorry.

571
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,375
I'm so sorry.

572
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:40,916
That's OK.

573
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:42,700
It's OK.

574
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:52,692
My mum likes a lot of bacon so,
you should go talk to Jack.

575
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:55,615
Not talk.

576
00:39:56,164 --> 00:39:57,235
Ignore him.

577
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,627
Watch and learn.

578
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,125
All those lies about my brothers...

579
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:18,586
Bitch better watch her mouth.

580
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:22,405
You and your whore mamma
better shut your faces.

581
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:24,029
You hear me?

582
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,407
This is just about
summoning them to trial.

583
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:50,525
All you have to do is identify them.

584
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:53,014
You're gonna keep your eyes on me.

585
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,797
And don't look at anyone else.

586
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,247
Until you ask me, who?

587
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,982
Not who, but if.

588
00:40:59,632 --> 00:41:01,151
If you see them?

589
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,035
First I'm gonna ask how you
knew them to establish...

590
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:07,213
She didn't know them, they
knew from the neighborhood.

591
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,475
Mom, stay out of this.

592
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:11,292
- Mrs Kevecki.
- Knew them? Jesus Christ!

593
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:12,794
You're right.

594
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,060
She didn't know them.

595
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:19,503
And I will make that very
clear in Court, I promise.

596
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,382
OK, I hope so.

597
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,522
Hey.

598
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:26,547
Eyes on me.

599
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:28,803
OK?

600
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,208
Here we go.

601
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,581
Mrs McGuire,

602
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:35,186
Do you see these men in Court today?

603
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,623
Yes, I see them.

604
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:39,644
Perfect.

605
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,063
It couldn't be any better.

606
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,251
OK?

607
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:43,762
Sweetie?

608
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:45,031
What do you think? Look.

609
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:46,390
I think they look conservative.

610
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:47,765
Mom, no.

611
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,854
Here, I got this.

612
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:52,915
See?

613
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:54,113
Thank you.

614
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:57,844
I really should be there.

615
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:00,751
No, she can't.
She gets too emotional.

616
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,845
It's OK.

617
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:05,104
Mrs Kevecki, this is just a
hearing, it's nothing...

618
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,754
At trial, yes, we will need you there.

619
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,451
Nothing? This is my daughter,
my daughter is not nothing.

620
00:42:10,476 --> 00:42:13,025
We don't need you for this.

621
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,430
I think we have a winner.

622
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:19,487
Great.

623
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:22,372
So, we're all set?

624
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:23,988
Are we, mom?

625
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:26,037
Are we all set?

626
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,290
Yes, baby.

627
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,138
You're doing great.

628
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:31,845
- We're all set.
- OK.

629
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,860
OK?

630
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:34,281
Alright.

631
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Yeah.

632
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,809
You are my brave girl.

633
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:44,837
Are you hungry?

634
00:42:46,488 --> 00:42:48,678
I made some soup... tomato.

635
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,439
With bacon and that,
like Daddy used to do.

636
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,169
Let's go heat it up.

637
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:57,219
I'll be right back.

638
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,373
Teena.

639
00:43:05,587 --> 00:43:06,928
Friday morning

640
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,019
is the first step,

641
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:12,345
in a series of steps to make
sure that men like that,

642
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,824
never do this to anyone ever again.

643
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:21,842
Hey.

644
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:25,772
I'll see you in Court.

645
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:41,814
Detective Dromoor...

646
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:08,146
You point them out,

647
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:09,740
I'll put them away.

648
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,280
♪ <i>Teena...</i> ♪

649
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:20,336
♪ <i>Teena...</i> ♪

650
00:44:20,337 --> 00:44:21,573
You lying whore!

651
00:44:21,598 --> 00:44:22,608
What did you say?

652
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:24,510
- I said...
- Shh.. Irma.

653
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:25,680
Take a seat.

654
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,606
Silence!

655
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:39,184
All rise!

656
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:47,474
We seem to be missing a lawyer!

657
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:48,499
Right!

658
00:44:48,806 --> 00:44:50,112
You may be seated!

659
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:02,728
Jay Kirkpatrick for the
defense, your Honor.

660
00:45:02,729 --> 00:45:04,834
My sincere apologies.

661
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:08,400
I got trapped on a conference
call on a Federal matter.

662
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:10,408
No harm, no foul.

663
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:12,477
Good morning, counselor.

664
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,524
Good morning!

665
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,681
All right!

666
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:16,726
So...

667
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,687
What are we all doing here this morning?

668
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:23,691
Your Honor, on July 4th, Marteen
McGuire was viciously attacked,

669
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:27,677
in fact, she was gang-raped in
the presence of her daughter,

670
00:45:27,678 --> 00:45:29,239
who was also assaulted.

671
00:45:29,264 --> 00:45:32,417
The State plan is to show that
the attack was premeditated

672
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:35,236
as the defendants stalked
her ten minutes prior.

673
00:45:35,746 --> 00:45:39,407
This gruesome attack was
intended to lead to the death

674
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:42,499
of Mrs McGuire, as she was left,

675
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:45,316
in a boat house, to bleed to death.

676
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:49,418
In fact, if Mrs McGuire's
daughter had not been present,

677
00:45:49,443 --> 00:45:54,146
Marteen McGuire would not be alive
today, to give her testimony.

678
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:58,775
Mrs McGuire suffered
serious physical injuries,

679
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,415
she's been in intensive care

680
00:46:01,482 --> 00:46:05,034
and she's still recuperating
from the attack today.

681
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,313
Your Honor,

682
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,740
Marteen McGuire's presence
in this Courtroom today

683
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:10,413
is something of a miracle.

684
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:11,828
Your Honor,

685
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:17,285
I had no idea that the People
intended on trying this case today.

686
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:19,877
But... if it pleases the Court,

687
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:22,102
we're ready.

688
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:26,267
OK!

689
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:29,995
Well, then I'll just save my
opening statement for the trial.

690
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,152
Call your first witness.

691
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:36,158
The People call detective John Dromoor.

692
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:48,072
And on the night of July 4th, detective,

693
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:51,238
you responded to a call
in Rocky Point Park.

694
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,080
Your Honor,

695
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:57,191
We're gonna have big
problems here if the State

696
00:46:57,192 --> 00:47:01,068
refuses to honor the basic
principles of discovery.

697
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:03,952
We have no record of a call.

698
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,399
One moment, you Honor.

699
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,871
Actually, me and my partner were coming
from another call, when we observed...

700
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:12,470
Actually, detective,
it's my partner and I...

701
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:15,318
And actually, there's
no question pending.

702
00:47:16,297 --> 00:47:17,783
I'd like to rephrase, your Honor.

703
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:18,876
Thank you, Jesus.

704
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,339
Detective, on the
night of July 4th

705
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,510
when you and your partner were
driving through Rocky Point Park,

706
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,704
What did you observe?

707
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,367
An injured young female came towards
us from outside the boat house.

708
00:47:29,507 --> 00:47:32,260
This young girl here? Bethel McGuire?

709
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:33,285
Yes.

710
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,214
And when you entered the boat
house, what did you observe?

711
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,735
Detective, you may step down.

712
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:54,072
The People call Marteen McGuire.

713
00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:07,763
Excuse me, Mrs McGuire,

714
00:48:07,764 --> 00:48:10,607
would you mind removing
the sun glasses?

715
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:12,338
It's really not that
bright in here.

716
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:16,067
Your Honor, due to the injuries Mrs
McGuire sustained in this brutal attack,

717
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:18,776
she's been made unusually
susceptible to light.

718
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:21,471
Well, they're distracting,

719
00:48:21,758 --> 00:48:24,399
perhaps she could try squinting.

720
00:48:29,317 --> 00:48:30,839
Thank you Mrs McGuire.

721
00:48:49,354 --> 00:48:50,889
- Mrs McGuire?
- Yeah?

722
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:55,477
Prior to your attack,

723
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:57,485
did you know the assailants?

724
00:48:57,613 --> 00:48:59,126
They knew my name.

725
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:01,110
Objection! Unresponsive!

726
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:03,488
- Teena, Teena...
- Sustained!

727
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:04,533
Teena!

728
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:07,476
Please, wait for the next
question, Mrs McGuire.

729
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:09,323
- Yes, I see them.
- Look at me.

730
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:14,153
Your Honor, the defense
is happy to stipulate,

731
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:18,031
Mrs McGuire's positive identification
of all four defendants.

732
00:49:18,828 --> 00:49:21,219
Thank you, Mrs McGuire,
you may step down.

733
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:24,897
- Excuse me, your Honor...
- No, no, they're here! They're here.

734
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,610
I'm sorry, Miss Dixon...

735
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:30,189
Does the State have another
question for this witness?

736
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,497
No, your Honor.

737
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:33,414
Yes, they're there, they're right there!

738
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,452
Shh, OK, let's go.

739
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,910
Do I do OK, do I have a chance?
They'll move them?

740
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,284
I don't know, it'll be right up.

741
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:05,780
You did fine.

742
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:11,690
The evidence is overwhelming.

743
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:15,428
Justice demands that these men
stand trial on first degree rape,

744
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,174
predatory assault and
aggravated assault.

745
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,329
Your Honor,

746
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,926
my clients

747
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:27,412
freely admit that they had sex with
Mrs McGuire in that boat house.

748
00:50:28,878 --> 00:50:30,725
But it wasn't rape,

749
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,333
it was consensual.

750
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:37,537
As the evidence will show,

751
00:50:38,593 --> 00:50:41,652
Mrs McGuire had been drinking
earlier that evening

752
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:44,545
at a party given by
a Raymond Casey.

753
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:46,090
Her...

754
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:48,398
ladies' boyfriend.

755
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:55,568
A party where five kegs of beer
were consumed by 19 people.

756
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:02,361
You know a keg of beer has
165,12 oz of beer in it?

757
00:51:02,386 --> 00:51:05,440
Five kegs of beer, 19 people?
It's mind boggling.

758
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:08,804
And then, shortly after midnight,

759
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:12,249
after she had gotten in a
fight with her boyfriend.

760
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,386
Mrs McGuire dragged her
12 year old daughter

761
00:51:15,387 --> 00:51:17,587
to Rocky Point Park.

762
00:51:18,197 --> 00:51:20,030
- We were walking home!
- Shh.

763
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:23,452
Young lady, you will control yourself.

764
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:26,251
She dragged her daughter
to Rocky Point Park,

765
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:28,523
where she met up with the defendants.

766
00:51:29,324 --> 00:51:30,795
Whom she knew.

767
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:36,528
And she offered to trade money for sex.

768
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:43,867
And then afterwards, after the
defendants were all set to leave,

769
00:51:44,176 --> 00:51:48,578
Mrs McGuire suddenly decided
to raise her price.

770
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,039
And then she

771
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,466
wildly, drunken attacked,

772
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:53,879
the defendants.

773
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:57,800
My clients were simply
defending themselves.

774
00:51:58,437 --> 00:51:59,812
And then, they left.

775
00:51:59,837 --> 00:52:01,842
- Objection, your Honor.
- Overruled.

776
00:52:01,915 --> 00:52:05,579
My clients and they're companions were
drinking, they freely admit that.

777
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:08,550
But at no time,

778
00:52:09,065 --> 00:52:10,623
at no time,

779
00:52:11,097 --> 00:52:12,270
were they aware

780
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,731
of the presence of a 12 year old girl,

781
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,885
who apparently hurt herself

782
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:19,648
while she was crawling
into a storage area.

783
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,142
And by her own testimony, admits,

784
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:25,813
that at no time,

785
00:52:26,014 --> 00:52:30,193
did she ever actively
see any acts of rape,

786
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:32,800
or any other crimes being committed.

787
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:36,050
This was a confused
and frightened child.

788
00:52:36,213 --> 00:52:39,767
Whose mother was so derelict as a parent.

789
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:40,847
Objection, your Honor.

790
00:52:40,848 --> 00:52:44,767
To drag her to a drunken orgy
of the Fourth of July party.

791
00:52:44,806 --> 00:52:46,338
Little Bethel McGuire,

792
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,777
is a victim.

793
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:49,963
- Your Honor, she was unconscious.
- Overruled!

794
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:51,473
She's a victim.

795
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,987
That's right.

796
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:54,948
Of her mother's

797
00:52:54,973 --> 00:52:57,825
outrageous negligence.

798
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:02,756
Who was so confused at the
time of the alleged rape.

799
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:06,377
That she may have misled
her at a later time.

800
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:08,396
Her testimony and her mother's

801
00:53:09,464 --> 00:53:11,870
is completely fabricated and misleading.

802
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:16,532
As the evidence, and my
clients' testimony will show,

803
00:53:16,904 --> 00:53:19,487
They did not rape or assault anybody.

804
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:23,416
They're completely innocent

805
00:53:23,758 --> 00:53:25,044
of all charges.

806
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:28,965
No!

807
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:30,273
No!

808
00:53:31,092 --> 00:53:32,899
No, no, no, no, no.

809
00:53:38,471 --> 00:53:39,527
Look at me.

810
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,150
No!

811
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:54,687
No, no!

812
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,773
How?

813
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:58,256
How can you do this?

814
00:53:58,281 --> 00:54:01,169
How can you do this to either of us?

815
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:06,600
Somebody call an ambulance.

816
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:36,037
Not too bad, huh?

817
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:16,000
Your mom's gonna be OK.

818
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:17,722
Gave something to sleep.

819
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:19,628
At least through the night.

820
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,042
Oh, not now, honey.

821
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:31,186
- Give her some time.
- I just wanna see her.

822
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,003
Bethie, the doctor's right.

823
00:55:36,692 --> 00:55:38,593
We need to let her rest, OK?

824
00:55:40,793 --> 00:55:42,729
You know? You should all get some rest.

825
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:44,276
Sleep when she sleeps.

826
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:45,295
Thank you.

827
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:53,736
Oh, God...

828
00:55:54,943 --> 00:55:56,163
How is she doing?

829
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:57,829
How do you think?

830
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:00,875
Get out.

831
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,023
Get out!

832
00:56:03,024 --> 00:56:04,114
Mrs Kevecki...

833
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:05,233
You...

834
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,222
promised...

835
00:56:07,578 --> 00:56:09,189
to protect Teena.

836
00:56:10,613 --> 00:56:12,378
You promised justice.

837
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:13,498
And we're gonna get it.

838
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:14,774
My daughter...

839
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:17,113
is unwell.

840
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,484
A trial would kill her.

841
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:24,095
A trial would kill all of us.

842
00:56:24,096 --> 00:56:25,467
That's not gonna happen.

843
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,985
The Kirkpatrick strategy

844
00:56:28,129 --> 00:56:30,868
is to try to manipulate the
jurors and the gallery.

845
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:32,187
Well, it worked.

846
00:56:32,394 --> 00:56:34,589
Jurors want to vote not guilty.

847
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,031
It's the generous
Christian thing to do.

848
00:56:37,032 --> 00:56:39,049
Oooh, is that supposed
to be encouraging?

849
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,223
I'm ready for that, for Him.

850
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,824
The women are being attacked.

851
00:56:45,004 --> 00:56:47,856
Rape must be punished, I'm not
gonna let them get away with this.

852
00:56:47,881 --> 00:56:49,709
Now, I need to see Teena.

853
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:52,049
I need you to leave.

854
00:56:52,149 --> 00:56:53,305
Wait!

855
00:58:10,268 --> 00:58:11,685
Hey, can I get a beer?

856
00:58:23,549 --> 00:58:24,830
Are you OK?

857
00:58:31,977 --> 00:58:33,029
Sorry!

858
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,893
You have a child.

859
00:59:30,078 --> 00:59:31,285
You have a daughter.

860
00:59:34,518 --> 00:59:36,930
We both know what it's like
to lose someone we love.

861
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:41,417
Don't let her lose her mother too.

862
00:59:42,886 --> 00:59:44,819
Don't let her feel any more pain.

863
00:59:47,424 --> 00:59:49,162
Why do you care?

864
00:59:50,912 --> 00:59:53,392
Because you found me?

865
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,170
Because you met me in a bar... once?

866
01:00:02,461 --> 01:00:03,793
You don't get it.

867
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:07,701
They killed me already.

868
01:00:09,535 --> 01:00:11,621
They just didn't finish it.

869
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,834
I'm moving very slowly.

870
01:00:42,801 --> 01:00:44,225
Thanks, Mrs Lewis.

871
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,980
Give my love to your mum, honey,
I'm so glad she's feeling better.

872
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:48,674
I will. Thanks.

873
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:49,916
Bye, Annie.

874
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:15,105
Here kitty, kitty. Kitty!

875
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:18,865
Tiger Lily!

876
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:09,981
Mamma, I thought you were asleep.

877
01:02:09,982 --> 01:02:11,468
She needed a ride home.

878
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:13,281
Bethie, look at me.

879
01:02:13,794 --> 01:02:15,499
She's having a tough time.

880
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,504
You gotta keep an eye on her.

881
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:19,677
You gotta take real good care of her.

882
01:02:20,189 --> 01:02:22,830
I don't think she wants
anyone to take care of her.

883
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,626
You give that to your mum for me.

884
01:02:27,651 --> 01:02:30,514
She can call anytime, day or night.

885
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,579
Seven, O, Six...

886
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:48,237
Three, Five, Eight. Right.

887
01:03:26,891 --> 01:03:28,928
Leave us alone!

888
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,372
Miaow.

889
01:04:13,147 --> 01:04:14,504
They were here.

890
01:04:16,278 --> 01:04:17,987
Can you please help us?

891
01:04:24,078 --> 01:04:25,189
Thank you.

892
01:04:58,293 --> 01:04:59,523
Bethie Bear?

893
01:05:16,355 --> 01:05:17,970
Oooh, popcorn!

894
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:19,418
A-ha!

895
01:05:19,426 --> 01:05:22,041
And not until after dinner.

896
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:24,228
I love this kind.

897
01:05:33,884 --> 01:05:35,488
You seen Tiger Lily?

898
01:05:53,176 --> 01:05:55,061
Yes, come on!

899
01:05:56,271 --> 01:05:59,155
That's right! Make him bleed!

900
01:06:00,142 --> 01:06:01,169
Come on!

901
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:05,430
Hey! Hey! Twenty bucks
says he goes down in six.

902
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:07,460
Knock-out or TKO.

903
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:10,051
Huh? How about it, asshole?
Twenty bucks.

904
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:12,472
You don't got twenty bucks?

905
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,090
Is that all you got?

906
01:06:17,617 --> 01:06:18,617
OK.

907
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,097
OK.

908
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,821
Fall... down!

909
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:26,776
Come on! Call it!
Shithead's bleeding out!

910
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:31,858
You're ready, shit-wipe?
Cos they're about to call it.

911
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:43,394
Shit!

912
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:49,307
Pay up!

913
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,617
Relax, Jimmy!

914
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:04,331
It's OK.

915
01:07:04,638 --> 01:07:05,698
It's OK.

916
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:08,855
Hey.

917
01:07:10,654 --> 01:07:12,344
Spend it fast.

918
01:07:12,965 --> 01:07:14,676
Cos I'm gonna do you,

919
01:07:14,975 --> 01:07:18,259
just like I did Teena.

920
01:07:21,639 --> 01:07:22,646
What?

921
01:07:23,246 --> 01:07:26,027
Thought I didn't make you, Case?

922
01:07:27,924 --> 01:07:30,028
You think I don't know who you are?

923
01:07:30,084 --> 01:07:31,398
Jimmy?

924
01:07:35,054 --> 01:07:37,442
You want another Court date?

925
01:08:06,043 --> 01:08:08,142
Another one of these and a shot of Jack.

926
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:54,966
- That's called a head, baby.
- Jimmy!

927
01:08:56,438 --> 01:08:58,349
Oh, that's a bitch!

928
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,730
Stay back! Police!

929
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:20,286
John Dromoor, badge 736, requesting
an ambulance and a coroner's wagon.

930
01:09:20,598 --> 01:09:22,045
Chippewa and 4th.

931
01:09:22,349 --> 01:09:23,785
And at the time of the shooting,

932
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,517
you were entirely unaware
that this was James de Lucca.

933
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:28,458
Yes, Sir, no idea.

934
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:31,778
You saw him less than
a month ago in Court.

935
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:34,080
It was dark.

936
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,779
He was brandishing a knife.

937
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,412
And before in the bar?

938
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:38,996
When he was watching the fight?

939
01:09:38,997 --> 01:09:40,339
I wasn't at the bar.

940
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,292
I was at a table.

941
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:45,949
So, John, when you fired your weapon,
it was purely self-defense, right?

942
01:09:46,009 --> 01:09:47,047
Yes, Sir.

943
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:50,822
Three years in the service.

944
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:54,193
Desert Storm.

945
01:09:54,438 --> 01:09:55,750
A Purple Heart.

946
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,927
Rocky Point was your case, detective.

947
01:10:01,247 --> 01:10:03,210
So, you're telling me at
the time of the shooting

948
01:10:03,211 --> 01:10:05,974
you had no idea about Raymond Casey's
connection with Marteen McGuire?

949
01:10:05,975 --> 01:10:07,564
Just a name on a file.

950
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,507
My partner did the interview.

951
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:11,874
Name on a file?

952
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:14,772
Coincidence?

953
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,176
Come on, John.

954
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,073
You, Casey and de Lucca in
a parking lot together?

955
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:20,136
No.

956
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,653
No coincidence.

957
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,943
More like... it was meant to be.

958
01:10:26,715 --> 01:10:27,735
Like...

959
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:29,744
If there is a God...

960
01:10:32,673 --> 01:10:35,040
In retrospect it felt like...

961
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:39,954
I had a purpose.

962
01:10:41,633 --> 01:10:43,952
And what was that purpose, John?

963
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:47,204
John?

964
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:52,289
To discharge my sworn duty
as an officer of the law.

965
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:12,340
Next week, Friday, 9 AM.

966
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,350
Works for me.

967
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:15,130
Well, Haaber's attorney
can't do the sixth.

968
01:11:15,155 --> 01:11:19,728
Council for Haaber is in Court on
another matter but I have his power.

969
01:11:19,729 --> 01:11:21,632
Next week is impossible.

970
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,398
Sadly...

971
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:26,437
de Lucca's power, we won't be needing.

972
01:11:26,438 --> 01:11:28,211
Your Honor, I need more time.

973
01:11:28,236 --> 01:11:29,642
This is not a discussion.

974
01:11:30,293 --> 01:11:32,279
Mr Kirkpatrick's
clients have exercised

975
01:11:32,304 --> 01:11:34,512
their 6th Amendment Right
to a speedy trial.

976
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:36,789
Speed is my middle name.

977
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,336
And that's the day.

978
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:08,577
All right, here's the deal.

979
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,691
Lose the rape one and
the predatory assaults

980
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:16,131
drop the agg assaults to
misdo's and we're done.

981
01:12:17,444 --> 01:12:19,055
Misdemeanor assault?

982
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:23,827
The Ficks plead on two counts.

983
01:12:24,516 --> 01:12:26,425
For Teena, for the kid.

984
01:12:27,088 --> 01:12:30,405
18 months each on each
count... consecutive.

985
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,931
Three years guaranteed.

986
01:12:34,107 --> 01:12:36,102
Have you seen Teena McGuire?

987
01:12:36,127 --> 01:12:38,364
Have you seen what they did to her?

988
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,513
Have you?

989
01:12:43,847 --> 01:12:47,214
Since the hearing, have
you even talked to her?

990
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,967
But you've tried.

991
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,724
Went by the house...

992
01:12:54,951 --> 01:12:57,593
Sweet-talked the mum, the kid...

993
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:02,815
Oh, I promise, I promise it'll
all be different in trial.

994
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:08,449
The hearing was the trial.

995
01:13:08,754 --> 01:13:10,285
It's over.

996
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:14,839
Teena's not coming back to Court.

997
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:18,584
Not by Friday.

998
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:23,137
You son of a bitch.

999
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:28,652
No victim, no witness, that's a
hard case to win in any venue.

1000
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:31,387
And this town by next week?

1001
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,337
The case is dismissed.

1002
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:45,280
What happened to winning this?

1003
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,891
A Jury trial.

1004
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,592
No guarantees.

1005
01:13:51,843 --> 01:13:53,862
I had to finish my shift.

1006
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,432
He wants to make a deal.
Jail. Three years.

1007
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,698
I'm presenting an option.

1008
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,772
Do you not hear yourself?
We are the victims.

1009
01:14:02,773 --> 01:14:05,292
That drunk bitch came on
to us, selling her ass.

1010
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:07,452
You said, you said that...
we were, we all agreed

1011
01:14:07,453 --> 01:14:10,947
we were messed up and then the
cops went looking for the wrong guys.

1012
01:14:10,948 --> 01:14:13,445
Three years sound pretty
good to me, considering.

1013
01:14:13,446 --> 01:14:16,156
Considering what? They didn't do it!

1014
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:21,105
Mrs Fick, in a Jury trial...
there's always a risk.

1015
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,898
And a good attorney
advises you of that risk.

1016
01:14:26,525 --> 01:14:27,892
If we lose...

1017
01:14:27,893 --> 01:14:29,967
We're not going to lose,
that's the whole point!

1018
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:33,257
It's 20 years in State Prison, minimum.

1019
01:14:33,258 --> 01:14:37,095
No, no, no, no... Jail is jail, been
there, done that, I ain't going back.

1020
01:14:37,475 --> 01:14:40,286
We're on! I swear to Christ!

1021
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:41,716
Canada! We'll go to Canada.

1022
01:14:41,717 --> 01:14:43,416
No, no, no, you won't.

1023
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:46,000
I put up my damned house.

1024
01:14:48,552 --> 01:14:50,807
You don't have to decide right now.

1025
01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:53,119
Talk it over as a family.

1026
01:14:53,296 --> 01:14:54,559
We've decided.

1027
01:14:54,977 --> 01:14:57,984
Teena McGuire is a lying whore,
no-one's gonna believer her.

1028
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:02,234
My boys are not pleading guilty
to something they did not do.

1029
01:15:02,235 --> 01:15:03,409
That's it!

1030
01:15:03,873 --> 01:15:05,936
Innocent people don't do time.

1031
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,698
You gonna cry, bitch?

1032
01:15:45,868 --> 01:15:47,304
No, bitch.

1033
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:49,163
No, bitch.

1034
01:15:53,472 --> 01:15:54,594
Start talking.

1035
01:15:56,206 --> 01:15:57,408
Yeah, you got him.

1036
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,376
Yeah.

1037
01:16:07,616 --> 01:16:08,966
Yeah, I just need the...

1038
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:10,916
Now, we see an apple pie right above it.

1039
01:16:11,027 --> 01:16:12,117
I gotta get a pie.

1040
01:16:12,142 --> 01:16:13,649
I have to get a pie, I would love it.

1041
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:15,012
Hm?

1042
01:16:15,013 --> 01:16:17,978
Look, I can have a pie right above the
top with squiggly lines coming out?

1043
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:21,684
Like it's still hot, like you
just took a pie out of the oven?

1044
01:16:21,948 --> 01:16:23,372
- Cos...
- Hm.

1045
01:16:23,373 --> 01:16:24,373
Yeah.

1046
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:25,948
- I like it.
- OK.

1047
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:30,662
Cos my mum, she got me a pie, she
made a pie one time for my birthday.

1048
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:34,440
Instead of her getting a pie,
which Marvin...

1049
01:16:34,441 --> 01:16:35,969
Marvin, remember the birthday pie?

1050
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:39,037
- Remember the birthday pie?
- Shut up, dipshit.

1051
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:40,062
Yeah.

1052
01:16:40,736 --> 01:16:43,618
Yeah, she, she made me a pie for...

1053
01:16:43,643 --> 01:16:44,643
Go again?

1054
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:46,901
I didn't eat it in time so
the candles had melted.

1055
01:16:46,926 --> 01:16:50,094
So I ate with... and I got
to wax out of my teeth,

1056
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:53,123
and I didn't brush my teeth so they were
stuck in my teeth for about a week.

1057
01:16:53,147 --> 01:16:54,207
- OK, Lloyd?
- Yeah?

1058
01:16:54,232 --> 01:16:56,457
- You gotta stay still.
- Gotcha.

1059
01:16:58,749 --> 01:16:59,808
Right.

1060
01:17:08,218 --> 01:17:09,535
What's up, dog?

1061
01:17:12,623 --> 01:17:14,152
Everything good on the phone?

1062
01:17:14,177 --> 01:17:15,615
We'd better be going, baby.

1063
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,640
Oh.

1064
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:20,009
You remember the pie?

1065
01:17:21,924 --> 01:17:23,591
You remember the pie.

1066
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:24,929
I remember the belt.

1067
01:17:24,964 --> 01:17:26,484
We're meeting an investigator?

1068
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,724
Legal investigator.

1069
01:17:28,884 --> 01:17:30,180
Works for Kirkpatrick.

1070
01:17:31,624 --> 01:17:33,915
I don't get why we're going
to meet him, though.

1071
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,140
You don't get shit.
That's why they called me.

1072
01:17:37,494 --> 01:17:39,261
No, I just... Ah, my dick!

1073
01:17:39,286 --> 01:17:41,635
Yo, I almost frigging
burned my dick off.

1074
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:45,146
No, I don't get why he called ...you.

1075
01:17:45,646 --> 01:17:48,622
Like why can't Kirkpatrick come and
get this on his own, you know?

1076
01:17:48,713 --> 01:17:51,885
Bitch, Kirkpatrick is an officer of
the Court. These guys stay clean.

1077
01:17:53,615 --> 01:17:56,121
I told your ass!
Everything that criminates their side

1078
01:17:56,146 --> 01:17:58,051
cannot come from our lawyer.

1079
01:17:58,756 --> 01:18:00,157
And this criminates...?

1080
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:02,632
We're about to get the evidence...?

1081
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:05,330
That criminates the
shit out of Teena, yes!

1082
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,792
He's got proof that
she sold her pussy...

1083
01:18:07,793 --> 01:18:09,140
Pussy likes it rough...

1084
01:18:09,165 --> 01:18:11,272
pictures, sworn statements.

1085
01:18:11,273 --> 01:18:14,064
- But this is good.
- This is good as shit, yeah.

1086
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:21,415
There he is.

1087
01:18:28,933 --> 01:18:30,090
He's gone.

1088
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:32,132
So, now what? He gets out?

1089
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,766
No, now you get out.

1090
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:36,510
- I get out?
- You get the stuff.

1091
01:18:38,336 --> 01:18:40,050
You want me to get out in this rain?

1092
01:18:40,072 --> 01:18:41,352
Yeah, bro!

1093
01:18:41,872 --> 01:18:42,968
I got...

1094
01:18:42,969 --> 01:18:45,033
Judas Priest, little brother!
Where'd you get that?

1095
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:46,755
I know a guy that...

1096
01:18:46,953 --> 01:18:48,446
- Oh, you know a guy?
- Yeah.

1097
01:18:48,447 --> 01:18:50,530
Good for you, John Wayne. Get out!

1098
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:54,032
OK! Fuck! What the fuck did I
do now for you to act like that?

1099
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:57,568
You never listen to me when
I tell you to do shit.

1100
01:18:57,659 --> 01:18:59,263
What are you yelling at me for?

1101
01:19:00,389 --> 01:19:02,184
No, no, he's not inside!

1102
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:04,488
- What?
- He's not inside!

1103
01:19:06,106 --> 01:19:07,317
Well, check!

1104
01:19:08,728 --> 01:19:11,185
There's an envelope.
I'm grabbing this envelope.

1105
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,158
Yo, it says...

1106
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:15,990
I think this is...

1107
01:19:17,156 --> 01:19:18,235
What?

1108
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,549
It says "Ficks, confidential..."

1109
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:25,108
No, no, no, who is this? Huh?

1110
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:30,818
You, son of a bitch!

1111
01:19:30,819 --> 01:19:32,525
We'll settle this!

1112
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:58,357
Officer 567 requesting.

1113
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:00,595
Hey partner, the keys
are in the ignition.

1114
01:20:02,018 --> 01:20:04,913
New York State vehicle tag,
India, Seven Two,

1115
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:08,391
- Romeo, Oscar, Roger, over...
- Copy that.

1116
01:20:08,652 --> 01:20:11,993
I got a case of beer... three are left.

1117
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:15,383
Hiking charts?

1118
01:20:18,058 --> 01:20:19,747
The Canadian side is missing.

1119
01:20:28,076 --> 01:20:30,960
Get off my property! This is a private
property, you're trespassing.

1120
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:32,040
Get out of here!

1121
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:34,952
You got any relatives in Canada?
Friends? Some place where they might go?

1122
01:20:34,953 --> 01:20:37,427
These are my boys, they wouldn't
do this. Something happened!

1123
01:20:37,428 --> 01:20:38,971
We lost our house.

1124
01:20:39,037 --> 01:20:40,531
That's what happened.

1125
01:20:40,556 --> 01:20:43,199
No, they wouldn't run! I'm telling you.
They wouldn't do this.

1126
01:20:43,224 --> 01:20:44,784
Walt get back out here!

1127
01:20:44,809 --> 01:20:46,719
Mrs Fick, have you heard from them?

1128
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,958
I'm their mother.

1129
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:50,184
They would've let me know.
They would tell me something.

1130
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,125
Do you think we will
hear from your sons?

1131
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:54,369
All right.
You wanna know what happened?

1132
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:55,649
I'll tell you!

1133
01:20:55,736 --> 01:20:58,234
It's that bitch Teena McGuire.

1134
01:20:58,235 --> 01:21:01,744
She's the one who drove my boys away!

1135
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:03,085
Get out of here!

1136
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:04,605
They're gone!

1137
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:06,725
They're outlaws!

1138
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,901
They're...

1139
01:21:08,172 --> 01:21:10,986
There you have it.
Outlaws or fugitives.

1140
01:21:16,825 --> 01:21:17,841
Mamma!

1141
01:21:18,877 --> 01:21:19,935
Mum!

1142
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:25,510
The Ficks... gone. They're gone.

1143
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:27,062
[IF YOU BELIEVE YOU
MAY HAVE SEEN THEM,

1144
01:21:31,538 --> 01:21:34,017
Erm... doesn't break my heart.

1145
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,758
Yeah? But what if they come back?

1146
01:21:38,696 --> 01:21:40,098
Honey, they won't.

1147
01:21:40,232 --> 01:21:41,287
They could.

1148
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:46,145
You listen to me: They
will never hurt us again.

1149
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:47,707
I promise!

1150
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:49,125
Bethie!

1151
01:21:49,564 --> 01:21:50,564
OK.

1152
01:21:51,675 --> 01:21:52,675
OK.

1153
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,595
Heading to the mall.

1154
01:21:56,056 --> 01:21:58,722
Anyone wanna join me
for a bit of shopping?

1155
01:21:58,955 --> 01:21:59,972
I do!

1156
01:22:01,953 --> 01:22:03,757
Can we get some food along the way?

1157
01:22:03,782 --> 01:22:05,570
Only if you're driving.

1158
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:07,685
Hmm, I guess I'm driving.

1159
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,790
Thanks, mom.

1160
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,543
Come on, grandma.

1161
01:22:13,648 --> 01:22:14,925
Come on!

1162
01:22:32,387 --> 01:22:34,409
Like.. are you really like Bethie Bear?

1163
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,801
We're not the same, I'm shorter.

1164
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:40,091
- We're similar.
- Oh, look at this!

1165
01:22:41,612 --> 01:22:43,474
They are so cute.

1166
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:46,174
Hmm, too bad they don't
have them in my size.

1167
01:22:48,182 --> 01:22:49,919
I will check with her.

1168
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:04,059
Listen to me now,

1169
01:23:04,452 --> 01:23:06,118
before the boat house,

1170
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,175
before they raped your mum,

1171
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,652
I was gone. That's
what you say in Court.

1172
01:23:12,677 --> 01:23:13,861
Don't forget it.

1173
01:23:13,886 --> 01:23:15,509
Hey! They got them!

1174
01:23:19,322 --> 01:23:20,356
Bethie!

1175
01:23:20,357 --> 01:23:21,833
What'd just happened, honey?

1176
01:23:21,834 --> 01:23:23,046
Sweetheart?

1177
01:23:23,884 --> 01:23:24,898
Shh, hey!

1178
01:23:24,923 --> 01:23:25,923
Talk to me?

1179
01:23:26,207 --> 01:23:27,207
Bethie?

1180
01:23:27,232 --> 01:23:29,073
Bethie! Bethie!

1181
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,016
Hey! How'd you guys get on?

1182
01:23:33,187 --> 01:23:34,187
Bethie?

1183
01:23:34,954 --> 01:23:35,972
What happened?

1184
01:23:35,973 --> 01:23:38,557
- I don't know, she's...
- I'll go check on her.

1185
01:23:38,582 --> 01:23:39,784
Thank you.

1186
01:23:40,043 --> 01:23:41,122
Bethie!

1187
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,209
Hello?

1188
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:00,635
Fritz Haaber?

1189
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:02,315
Who wants to know?

1190
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:05,771
It is you.

1191
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:09,784
I don't know if you remember me,
Lou Ellen Drought?

1192
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:12,711
I was a few years behind
you in High School.

1193
01:24:13,793 --> 01:24:14,908
Lou Ellen?

1194
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,362
Yeah.

1195
01:24:18,072 --> 01:24:19,678
Yeah, Lou Ellen?

1196
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:21,697
Welcome back.

1197
01:24:21,698 --> 01:24:24,702
I heard you had a little bit of trouble

1198
01:24:24,703 --> 01:24:26,535
and I think I can help you out.

1199
01:24:26,536 --> 01:24:29,300
I know some things
about Teena McGuire.

1200
01:24:29,301 --> 01:24:32,157
Things a Jury should know.

1201
01:24:32,473 --> 01:24:34,758
Well, maybe... you should tell me.

1202
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,343
My daughter and I are staying
at the Blackburn's Motel.

1203
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:43,702
Yeah, I know that dive well.

1204
01:24:44,799 --> 01:24:48,218
You should come meet my
daughter and we can talk.

1205
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:51,688
11 PM, room 24.

1206
01:24:53,344 --> 01:24:56,304
Yeah, I look forward to meeting
your daughter as well.

1207
01:25:47,419 --> 01:25:48,730
Lou Ellen?

1208
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,189
♪ Lou Ellen? ♪

1209
01:26:19,342 --> 01:26:20,342
Sit.

1210

Write.

1211
01:26:28,527 --> 01:26:29,738
Write what?

1212
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:31,853
God, forgive me...

1213
01:26:32,111 --> 01:26:35,061
I did what I believed was
the right thing to do.

1214
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:37,840
Why would I write that?

1215
01:26:57,732 --> 01:26:59,330
Keep going, finish it.

1216
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:20,738
Happy?

1217
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,562
Put your hand on the gun.

1218
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:25,950
No.

1219
01:27:32,805 --> 01:27:34,825
Put your hand on the gun.

1220
01:28:05,672 --> 01:28:08,137
Guess who snapped himself last night?

1221
01:28:08,498 --> 01:28:09,498
Boom!

1222
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:11,353
Rocky Point.

1223
01:28:11,408 --> 01:28:12,720
Fritz Haaber.

1224
01:28:16,301 --> 01:28:18,002
You should send him flowers.

1225
01:28:33,133 --> 01:28:34,133
Mom?

1226
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:36,226
Mom!

1227
01:28:36,361 --> 01:28:37,430
She's outside.

1228
01:28:37,455 --> 01:28:38,675
D'you need her?

1229
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,241
Yeah, we need some more boxes.

1230
01:28:40,266 --> 01:28:42,470
I thought we had some
stashed in your closet.

1231
01:28:42,805 --> 01:28:44,990
We used the last ones last night.

1232
01:28:45,114 --> 01:28:46,516
- Sorry.
- No.

1233
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:48,385
It's not your fault.

1234
01:28:49,585 --> 01:28:51,113
Are you ready for this?

1235
01:28:52,114 --> 01:28:53,277
Yeah.

1236
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:55,029
I am.

1237
01:28:55,423 --> 01:28:56,503
Are you sure?

1238
01:28:57,461 --> 01:28:59,035
I'm ready for...

1239
01:28:59,635 --> 01:29:00,737
a change.

1240
01:29:00,954 --> 01:29:01,954
Me too.

1241
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,779
Where are you going?

1242
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,433
I was gonna say bye to Annie?

1243
01:29:10,772 --> 01:29:13,707
I also wanted to make one last stop.

1244
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,006
You wanna come with me?

1245
01:29:28,031 --> 01:29:30,005
You think I'm the bad guy?

1246
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,382
Because I defend men
that you think are...

1247
01:29:32,383 --> 01:29:33,631
Scum.

1248
01:29:36,156 --> 01:29:37,381
You know, John?

1249
01:29:37,756 --> 01:29:39,477
We have a document
in this country,

1250
01:29:39,502 --> 01:29:40,940
it's called the Constitution?

1251
01:29:41,145 --> 01:29:42,812
And in that document,

1252
01:29:42,909 --> 01:29:46,278
it expressly provides my services for...

1253
01:29:46,661 --> 01:29:48,141
all citizens.

1254
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:49,790
Even criminals.

1255
01:29:51,563 --> 01:29:53,953
What's not in that document,

1256
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,244
is vigilante cop justice.

1257
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:01,845
Even for cold-blooded murderers.

1258
01:30:05,387 --> 01:30:07,420
Maybe they had it coming.

1259
01:30:09,372 --> 01:30:10,735
Maybe they didn't.

1260
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:13,106
Guess we'll never know now.

1261
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,235
Who knows?

1262
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:21,015
You might even need my services someday.

1263
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:25,442
And I hope,

1264
01:30:25,854 --> 01:30:27,964
you'll never need mine.

1265
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:29,106
Hey.

1266
01:31:31,914 --> 01:31:33,869
I told once before,

1267
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:36,837
I don't a lot of real life heroes.

1268
01:31:38,188 --> 01:31:39,753
Your daughter is the hero.

1269
01:31:40,659 --> 01:31:41,811
Sorry.

1270
01:31:42,656 --> 01:31:44,429
I'll give you guys a moment.

1271
01:31:44,926 --> 01:31:46,334
You're alright?

1272
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:48,713
She seems stronger.

1273
01:31:49,214 --> 01:31:50,244
She's fine.

1274
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:52,186
Well, not fine but better.

1275
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:54,637
You've been taking good care of her.

1276
01:31:54,883 --> 01:31:56,709
You wanna come to the station?

1277
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:57,830
No.

1278
01:31:57,855 --> 01:31:59,003
Come on around at the gate.

1279
01:31:59,004 --> 01:32:00,395
We're leaving.

1280
01:32:01,185 --> 01:32:02,506
Tomorrow...

1281
01:32:03,229 --> 01:32:04,603
California.

1282
01:32:05,027 --> 01:32:08,181
I came to say good-bye,
we came to say good-bye.

1283
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:10,147
And thank you.

1284
01:32:11,804 --> 01:32:13,199
That day,

1285
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:16,607
you brought her home.

1286
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:17,722
Bethie...

1287
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,573
I just gave her a ride.

1288
01:32:21,255 --> 01:32:22,780
It was so bad.

1289
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,807
I've seen bad things.

1290
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:28,094
Things I thought I'd never forget.

1291
01:32:28,946 --> 01:32:30,603
We do forget.

1292
01:32:31,186 --> 01:32:33,084
Not all the way but...

1293
01:32:33,336 --> 01:32:35,124
enough so you can move on.

1294
01:32:35,493 --> 01:32:36,817
Leaving here?

1295
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:38,452
That's smart.

1296
01:32:39,636 --> 01:32:42,298
There's a lot more
sunshine in California.

1297
01:32:45,229 --> 01:32:46,573
I love you.

1298
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:53,346
You know?

1299
01:32:53,371 --> 01:32:55,051
I never had a daughter.

1300
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,993
You've never been married.

1301
01:32:58,566 --> 01:32:59,665
Have you?

1302
01:33:01,758 --> 01:33:03,202
I'll tell you something.

1303
01:33:03,907 --> 01:33:05,965
If I ever do have a daughter.

1304
01:33:06,967 --> 01:33:09,550
I hope she grows up
to be just like you.

1305
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:12,016
Everyday.

1306
01:33:16,449 --> 01:33:18,942
All right then, good-bye.
