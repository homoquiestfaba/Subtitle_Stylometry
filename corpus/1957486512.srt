00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,564
What are you doing
swatting flies?

3
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:31,465
I'm just warming up.

4
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,906
Warming up?

5
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,141
You're sweating already.

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,686
What was that?

7
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,687
Supposed to be a jab?

8
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:04,031
You're getting old, Doc.

9
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,534
How's this for getting old?

10
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:07,435
What was that?

11
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,702
A love tap?

12
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,971
You know, if you could
fight as well you could talk,

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,974
you'd be pretty tough.

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,843
I just don't want to hurt you.

15
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:16,777
Hurt me?

16
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:17,778
I'm a doctor.

17
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:27,721
Well, I hope you
make house calls,

18
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:28,789
because I'm sending you home.

19
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,364
You all right?

20
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,073
They're going to be
moving me any time now.

21
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:49,710
I know Don Vicaro.

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,679
I'm too a old to go to prison.

23
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,580
I know Don Vicaro.

24
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,386
I'll probably get the
gas chamber this time.

25
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,887
Can we have a
few minutes alone?

26
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,914
It's all taken
care of grandfather.

27
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,349
We're going to get
you out of here.

28
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,082
When?

29
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,017
When?

30
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:31,285
Tell me when.

31
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:35,189
Right about now.

Oh, shit.

36
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,882
Vicaro.

37
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:02,950
Come on, move it.

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,884
Hurry up.

39
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,659
What are you doing, man?

40
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,593
Nobody gets in.

41
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,694
Nobody gets out.

42
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:14,595
Let's go.

43
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,099
Come on.

44
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,200
Come on.

00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,255
[gunshots]

46
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,257
All right, let's go.

47
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,708
Let's go Move.

48
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,709
Move.
Go.

49
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:02,643
Everybody, go.

50
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,646
Go.

00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,015

52
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:24,598

[gunshots]

54
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,585
All right, let's get
this thing up in the air.

55
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,205
Take this down now
and get my grandson.

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,139
No way.

57
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,841
It's too dangerous.

58
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,742
Now!

59
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,395
DON VICARO: I
said, take it down,

60
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,597
or I'll blow you're
fucking head off.

61
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:30,831
Kill me, you kill us both.

62
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,100
If you don't take
it down, we both go.

63
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,015
Oh, man this is suicide.

64
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,016
Take it down.

65
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:11,338
[gunshots]

66
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,473

68
00:06:58,686 --> 00:06:59,820
DR. JOHNNY WU: OK.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,955
So first thing is
Mrs. Johnson's MRI.

70
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,591
Got to get that done
tomorrow morning.

71
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,192
And then the chest X-ray...

72
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,795
[yelling]

73
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,509
Take him to trauma three.

74
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,146
Look, we've got
four more coming

75
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,047
in from drive-by shooting.

76
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,316
Handle it.

77
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,217
WOMAN: Doctor?

78
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,853
Doctor, please?

79
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,955
She's in so much pain,
can't you do something?

80
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,290
We've been here for
an hour and a half.

81
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,225
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,693
We're understaffed.

83
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,995
I'll get a nurse here to
administer an IV immediately.

84
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,534
Get out of the way.

85
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,242
Listen up.

86
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,577
Now I don't want no crap.

87
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,011
My partner here is messed up.

88
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,981
I want him fixed, and
I want him fixed now.

89
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:01,915
Excuse me?

90
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,624
That's not how it
works around here.

91
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,161
Now, at any time did
you lose consciousness?

92
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,495
No, but the other guy did.

93
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,598
[laughter]

94
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,167
Well in that case, you're
going to have to wait

95
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,702
your turn like everybody else.

96
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,037
Suppose it is our turn.

97
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,606
Look, this is a hospital.

98
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,407
We don't want any trouble.

99
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,408
I hate doctors.

00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,011

[clapping]

103
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,953
Excuse me.

104
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,959
[helicopter]

105
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,289
[music playing]

106
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,988
Hi, gentlemen.

107
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,856
Sit down. sit down. sit
down, come on. sit down.

108
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,039
Oh, Mr. Carducci, they're
ready for you now.

109
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,017
Welcome, mi amicis.

110
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,185
I extend to each and
every one of you,

111
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,222
the comforts of my humble
abode and my appreciation

112
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,057
for your being here.

113
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,828
Gentlemen, tonight
we make history.

114
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,229
This was the past.

115
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:15,075
[finger snap] And this is
the future, our future.

116
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,377
Organized crime is on
the verge of becoming

117
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,912
an international
network that will

118
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,049
bring together business partners
from all over the planet.

119
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,952
And tonight, we have the elite
de creme de la creme of that...

120
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:28,255
Wu Fong of the Hong Kong triad.

121
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,259
The honorable, Soto Waianabashi
of the Japanese yakuza,

122
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,229
and mi amigo, Carlos Lopez
of the Bogota cartel.

123
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:41,001
And last but not least, our
esteemed comrade, Vladimir

124
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,437
Kruskev, without whose vision
and foresight none of this

125
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,939
would have been possible.

126
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,009
Now, smuggling nuclear weapons
from the old Soviet Union

127
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,178
and selling them
on the black market

128
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,981
is a different kind of line
than what we're used to.

129
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,783
But the profits
from this can make

130
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,151
us all very, very rich men.

131
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,087
Money, I like that.

132
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,789
Thanks to our
comrade, again, we

133
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,723
have what looks to be
an unlimited supply

134
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,992
of these weapons.

135
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,593
And coupled with an
overwhelming demand

136
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:11,198
from third world governments, it
all spells success, gentlemen.

137
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,901
The Carducci family
will broker the sales

138
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,569
and the buyers will handle
their own exploitation.

139
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,038
The monies will
then be moved again

140
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,808
through the same distribution
routes for laundering.

141
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,543
If we make good on this,
and I know we can gentlemen,

142
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,113
we're going to be in business
for a very long, long time.

143
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,948
How do we know
we can trust you?

144
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,417
You see that kind of
thinking is poison to us.

145
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,418
We are not the enemy.

146
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,352
Not me.

147
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,653
Not each other.

148
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,188
The feds, the Interpol,
they are the enemy.

149
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:38,725
United we conquer,
divided we perish.

150
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,161
We are the future of
the new world order.

151
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,965
And together we must rise,
and meet these challenges,

152
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,334
and become invincible.

153
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,468
Veni, vidi, vici.

154
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,370
I came, I saw, I conquered.

155
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,304
A Salute.

156
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,326
[music playing]

157
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,031
OK.

158
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,199
You all know what we got to do.

159
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,567
We'll meet back here
in five minutes.

160
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,035
Mike, you and Lance
got our backs.

161
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,399
Yo, man.

162
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,968
I don't know about this
robbing the mob shit, man.

163
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,937
Yo, man, it's like I told you.

164
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,140
We'll be long gone before
they even come here.

165
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,475
Let's just do what
we came to do.

166
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,045
[music playing]

167
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,003
It's this way.

168
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,137
You guys, follow...

169
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:37,971
What?

170
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,140
Somebody broke into the plant.

171
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,209
Well go... go take care of it.

172
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,858
What's the combo?

173
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,028
10 right.

174
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,929
10 to four.

175
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,265
24 left.

176
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,767
24.

177
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,803
And two to the right.

178
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,439
Two to the right.

179
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,373
In.

180
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,311
Oh, my lord.

181
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,587
Give me that bag.

182
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,524
Oh, yeah.

183
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,465
Just hurry up, man.

184
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,732
Hurry up.

185
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,901
Yeah.

186

00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,324
Go on in the car.

372
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,258
Go on in the car, son.

373
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:47,166
I packed enough food, but
you'll have to stop for milk.

374
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,534
Thanks, Marla.

375
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,169
I should have warned you.

376
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:53,472
He tried getting the camping
things ready himself.

377
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,673
That's OK.

378
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,075
He tried.

379
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:56,776
OK.

380
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,410
This is where we'll be.

381
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,746
And there's no phone
up there, so you

382
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:00,980
have to call me on my cellular.

383
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,748
OK.

384
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,582
Well don't worry about me.

385
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,119
Now you two take off and
have a wonderful time.

386
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,054
We will.

387
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,889
Oh, good.

388
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,057
MARLA: Are you in OK?

389
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,331
Bye-bye.

390
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,266
Bye-bye.

391
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,269
Bye-bye.

392
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,838
[music playing]

393
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,429
Yes?

394
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,198
Uh, is Dr. Wu in?

395
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,433
- No.
- No.

396
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh.

397
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,702
Well, um, we are
interior decorators.

398
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,504
And Dr. Wu says
that we could come

399
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,806
over and look at the place.

400
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,174
You know, because we
heard it's real nice.

401
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,675
So we just like, you
know, take a look at his,

402
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,978
you know, decorations,
and everything, OK?

403
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,580
Dr. Wu didn't see
anything about that.

404
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,416
Oh, well, I'm a
doctor, you know, and

405
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,784
an interior decorator, also.

406
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,753
And, you know, I know
Dr. Wu from the hospital.

407
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:48,955
And he says that
we could come over

408
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,622
here and look at the house.

409
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,958
You're a doctor?

410
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:55,061
Yeah, I'm a doctor and
an interior decorator.

411
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,763
I'd like to see some ID.

412
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,198
You want to see some ID?

413
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,833
- Yes.
- OK.

414
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,101
I'll show you some ID.

415
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,311
Well, this is it.

416
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,245
What do you think?

417
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,146
What a great cabin.

Daddy, daddy look.

423
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:01,928
Wow.

424
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,729
That's a lot of fish.

425
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,665
Look, that's a big one.

426
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:12,338
I'm going to catch the
biggest fish in the whole lake.

Yeah, get me on
with Mr. Carducci.

430
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,148
Oh, hold on a second.

Mr. Carducci, it's me, Vinn.

00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,363
Listen.

435
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,098
You know, Wu's not home right
now, but I know where he is.

436
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,567
He's up in some cabin, up in
some mountain, or something.

437
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,169
What do you want me to do?

438
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,436
You do what you gotta do.

439
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,938
You just make sure I
get that disk back.

Yeah.

441
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:48,440
OK.

442
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,708
Let's go.
Come on.

443
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:50,642
Let's go.
Get in.

444
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,038
DR. JOHNNY WU: Look
at that, Bobby.

445
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:24,977
BOBBY WU: Roar.

446
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:25,911
Come on.

447
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,113
Watch your head.

448
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,650
That must be a real cougar.

449
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,589
Hey there.

450
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,490
Hi.

451
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,059
Is that your pet cat?

452
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,760
No, it's a Sheba.

453
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,794
She's a cougar.

454
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,230
Wow.

455
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,232
I rescued her from a
poacher's trap this morning.

456
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,666
DR. JOHNNY WU: She's a beauty.

457
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,301
You must be the park ranger.

458
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,136
Yeah.

459
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:51,570
The only one on the mountain.

460
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,739
I'm Kelly Scarborough.

461
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,740
Johnny Wu, nice to meet you.

462
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,807
This is my son, Bobby.

463
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:56,775
Hi Bobby.

464
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,877
Hi.

465
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,412
So what brings
you two to Winslow?

466
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,281
We're just coming to pick
up some groceries for dinner.

467
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,553
Will you come eat with us?

468
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,222
Oh, I'm sure your mommy
and daddy want to be alone.

469
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,425
My mom is in heaven.

470
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,626
I'm sorry.

471
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,196
[hoots and hollers]

472
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,338
If you'll excuse me.

473
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,140
Just don't get too
close to the cat, OK?

474
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,848
Pretty nice cougar, huh?

475
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,285
Sure is.

476
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,252
Come on.

477
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,461
Howdy.

478
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,429
Nice day, isn't it?

479
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,430
It sure is.

480
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,031
- I'm Sheriff Watkins.
- I'm Johnny Wu.

481
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,300
This is my son, Bobby.

482
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,501
Are you all passing through?

483
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,169
No, we're going
fishing up at the lake.

484
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,272
Oh, that lake's got the
best tasting trout I ever had.

485
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,673
you know, a little butter
and a little lemon,

486
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,710
and you got yourself a meal
you won't find anywhere.

487
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,279
but you be on the lookout
for the big one up there.

488
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,048
The locals here call him Jaws.

489
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,318
You know he must
be 36 inches long

490
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:16,021
and would weigh at
least 15 pounds.

491
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,089
Y'all have fun now.

492
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,224
Sure will.

This you truck?

496
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,387
Well what do we have here?

497
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:28,026
Why, Clem, we got us a
genuine female ranger.

498
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:32,164
Only thing I like better
than a woman in uniform

499
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:36,635
is a woman in uniform
coming in for a drink.

500
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,204
Now come one,
don't be like that.

501
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,871
Come on inside.

502
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,772
Come on in...

503
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,278
Up against the
truck, fat head.

504
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,723
Sit here, Bobby.

505
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:58,824
I'll be right back.

506
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,025
All right.

507
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,593
I am shutting you guys down.

508
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:08,467
I am confiscating your truck,
your traps, everything else.

509

[laughter]

510
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,105
Shit.

511
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,741
What's the problem?

512
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,510
These poachers seem to
have a problem with the law.

513
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,245
Let's get them.

514
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,813
[music playing]

515
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,385
All right.

516
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,568
Well, thank you.

517
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,074
You know you still
haven't answered

518
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,244
Bobbie's question about dinner.

519
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,481
So are you inviting me now?

520
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,382
Yeah.

521
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,522
I'd love to.

522
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:41,092
How about, um, 8 o'clock,
up on Chowder hill.

523
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,729
Doc's place?

524
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:44,963
Yeah.

525
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:45,931
That'd be great.

526
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:46,998
Great.
OK.

527
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,667
I'll see you then.

528
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,601
OK.

529
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,141
Oh.

530
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,108
Whoa.

531
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,043
Bobby.

532
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:06,985
Let's go, Bobby.

533
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,060
Do you think Jaws is out there?

534
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,061
I'm not afraid.

535
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,629
I've got you to protect me.

536
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,330
That's right.

537
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,631
You sure do.

538
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,103
Oh, you got a big one.

539
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,071
Pull him in.

540
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,305
That's it.

541
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,807
Reel him in.

542
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:32,210
Oh, no.

543
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,013
oh, maybe next time.

544
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:35,947
OK.

545
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:46,257
OK, Bobby, put away your
toys, help me set the table.

546
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,093
Uh-oh.

547
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,128
What's the matter?

548
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,030
You don't like my cooking?

549
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,031
No way.

550
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,634
[chuckles]

551
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,225
She's here.

552
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,359
She sure is.

553
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,049
Hi.

554
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,050
Hi.

555
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,051
Come on in.

556
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,252
Thanks.

557
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,219
Where is Bobby?

558
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,455
There he is.

559
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,022
Hey there camper.

560
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:51,923
How are you doing?

561
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,525
Look what I got for you?

562
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,826
DR. JOHNNY WU: What do you say?

563
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:55,927
Thank you.

564
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:56,828
You're welcome.

565
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:25,924
Come on.

566
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,527
Come on.

567
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:30,195
Are you sure it's over there?

568
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,763
- Yeah, boss.
- OK.

569
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:32,764
Let's do it.

570
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,880
I like her, daddy.

571
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,881
Me too.

572
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,117
Give me a kiss.

573
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,118
Good night.

574
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:04,963
He is so sweet.

575
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,368
I hope you don't mind
me asking, but what

576
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,639
happened to Bobby's mother?

577
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,575
Julie was killed
in a car accident...

578
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,844
drunk driver.

579
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:22,180
I'm sorry.

580
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,282
So, what about you?

581
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,217
Never been married?

582
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,787
No.

583
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:32,724
You live up here all alone?

584
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah.

585
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,962
Must be nice.

586
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:39,330
Yeah, it is nice.

587
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,200
It's plenty of fresh
air, no phones.

588
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,969
It's beautiful.

589
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,905
I'd say mother nature
did a pretty good job.

590
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:47,839
I think so too.

591
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,344
I could get used
to living up here.

592
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,146
I don't know about that.

593
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,549
What do you mean?

594
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,652
You'd miss the
excitement of the city.

595
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,887
It gets pretty boring up here.

596
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,492
You did pretty well
with those poacher's.

597
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:10,161
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

598
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,496
The army.

599
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:12,864
The army?

600
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:13,799
Yeah.

601
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:15,433
Well, hey, you've
handled yourself

602
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,736
pretty well too, for a doctor.

603
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,307
So what made you
decide to get out?

604
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,217
I was stationed in
Iraq during the war,

605
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:35,420
and we were supposed to get
lines down on a nuclear plant

606
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,422
that Hussein was building.

607
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,690
We found the plant,
but they were

608
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,326
protecting it with
children, like live bait

609
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,328
for anybody with a weapon.

610
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:46,064
It made me sick.

611
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:53,171
War, killing, politics...
none of it made any sense.

612
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:56,007
I guess you could say a
spiritual revelation came over

613
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,743
me.

614
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:00,445
As soon as I got back,
I put in for discharge,

615
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:05,250
and this place is as
far away as I could get.

616
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,819
I love it up here, though.

617
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,821
And I know it sounds
sort of crazy,

618
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:16,594
but I feel like I'm
closer to heaven up here.

619
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,329
Doesn't sound crazy to me.

620
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,301
[music playing]

621
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,070
Thanks.

622
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,143
I had a wonderful time.

623
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:06,577
Me too.

624
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,014
Dinner was great.

625
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:12,217
Thank you.

626
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,452
Well, maybe tomorrow
morning you can show Bobby

627
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:15,721
and me around the lake.

628
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,155
Oh, yeah.
I'd love to.

629
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,089
That'd be great.

630
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,575
Well, um I guess, I should go.

631
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,010
I'll walk you to your car.

632
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:39,945
OK.

633
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,719
Yes!

634
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,321
[music playing]

635
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,325
[car starts]

636
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,849
[music playing]

637
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:57,255
Come on.

638
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,156
Let's go.

639
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:12,737
All right, come on.

640
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:13,704
You know what to do.
Let's go.

641
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:14,806
Come on.

642
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,302
Let's let them
know we're here.

643
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:51,877
[gunshots]

644
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:55,280
Hey, daddy, help.

645
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,371
All right, come
out the bag, Wu.

646
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,240
We know you got it.

647
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,342
Come on.

648
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,110
Hey, Wu, look.

649
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,145
All we want is the disk, OK?

650
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:29,881
So just give me the disk, OK?
That's it.

651
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:32,750
All right, Wu.

652
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,652
Bobby, stay here.

653
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:36,121
Don't move.
You'll be safe.

654
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,022
OK?

655
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:37,956
OK.

656
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,367
You want to play?

657
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,468
Huh, Wu?

658
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:51,402
You want to play?

659
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,303
OK.

660
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,371
I'll play with you.

661
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,339
OK, Wu?

662
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,400
Everybody, go.

663
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,875
OK.
OK.

664
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:32,610
Come on.
Let's load the place up.

665
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,104
[gunshots]

666
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:08,046
Freeze!

667
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,417
Put the guns down.

668
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:13,418
Drop them!

669
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,556
Bobby, it's all right, son.

670
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:19,490
Come on out.

671
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,062
Bobby, come out.

672
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:32,037
[laughs]

673
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:36,407
Bobby!

674
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:48,353
Daddy.

675
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,526
Thank god.

676
00:49:55,626 --> 00:50:00,098
You sure know how to
throw a dinner party, huh?

677
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:01,366
So who are they?

678
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:05,203
I don't know, but
I'm going to find out.

679
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:08,739
I'm scared, daddy.

680
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,541
Stay right here, Bobby.

681
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,043
KELLY: I don't get it.

682
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:16,047
MAC-11s, C-4, all
that manpower...

683
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:42,039
Whoever they are,
this is what they want.

684
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,474
What's on it?

685
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,243
I don't know.

686
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,378
My bag was switched
at an accident.

687
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,247
Let's just get
to the Sheriff's.

688
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,516
My truck's over here, come on.

689
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,999
Oh, great.

690
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,900
Oh, man.

691
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,737
They smashed the radio.

692
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:15,873
I hope you're up for a walk.

693
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,175
How far?

694
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:19,877
A good six miles.

695
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,078
No way.

696
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:24,048
Is there any place closer?

697
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:27,185
Yeah, there is.
Follow me.

698
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,192
VINNY (ON PHONE): Hello, Mr.
Carducci, it's me, Vinny.

699
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:36,327
I know who it is, stupid.

700
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:37,728
VINNY (ON PHONE): It
wasn't good, boss.

701
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,264
We got to the cabin and
shot it up like you said,

702
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:41,366
but then we got jumped
by ninjas or something.

703
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,067
There must have been 20 of them.

704
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:45,170
Karate kung fu fucks
all over the place.

705
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,904
And the doctor was on of them.

706
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,207
I tried to cap him,
but he got away.

707
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:50,241
I didn't get no disk.

708
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,742
I'm real sorry, Mr. Carducci.

709
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:52,943
All right.

710
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,845
Well, get your
skinny ass back here.

711
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,786
You have problems, comrade?

712
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:03,388
No.

713
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,290
No problems, just solutions.

714
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,658
You are beginning
to irritate me.

715
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:13,097
You tried to hide
something from me, no?

716
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:16,167
distrust... it goes both ways.

717
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:20,505
Comrade, we must see eye to eye.

718
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:23,107
This doctor got a hold of
something that belonged to me.

719
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:26,344
I sent my boys up to the
mountain to get it back.

720
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:30,147
One thing and another, and
the bastard took them out.

721
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,449
Most of them, anyway.

722
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:33,518
Except for that yo-yo
for brains, Vinnie.

723
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:36,621
On my mother's grave, what
did I do to deserve him?

724
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:41,592
What did this doctor
take that was so important?

725
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,294
The computer disk.

726
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,829
The disk with our
charts and everything?

727
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:45,996
Yeah, yea.

728
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,164
But I'm telling
you I'll handle it.

729
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:48,165
He doesn't even
know what he's got.

730
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,401
This is not good my friend.

731
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,003
I told you, I'll handle it.

732
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,138
No.

733
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,742
You will let me
find him for you.

734
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,076
What?

735
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,578
What do you want to let
psycho off the leash?

736
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:09,119
My friend, do
not be impertinent.

737
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,157

is for you that our operations

Besides, I have as much to
lose as you do, comrade.

your boys be in on the party?

likes to kill Americans,

You've got some
friends with you, huh?

754
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:57,862
This is Johnny
and his son, Bobby.

755

into some trouble.

I really need your help.

00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:11,609
Now, that had nothing to
do with you all, did it?

Afraid so.

764
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,944
I need you to watch
Bobby, here, until we

We'll look around
this ranch, here.

Are you sure Bobby is
going to be safe here?

Bronk's the greatest.

778

Get the disk, then fry him.

00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,491
He could have hid it somewheres.

Hey, and I'm not
your fucking comrade.

I trust you about as
far as I can spit.

Well, well, you son of a bitch.

Johnny, you'd better
take a look at this.

1021
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,036
What is it?

1022
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,737
It's an international

That's mafia.

It's the worst.

the Russian mob has gone crazy.

a major percentage

You stumbled onto an
international conspiracy.

Criminals with
nuclear weapons?

I mean, that's crazy.

1038
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:34,737
I mean, what would happen if...

1039
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:38,707
If just one of them gets
a wild hair up his ass...

nuclear threat was over.

do about Bobby, Mike?

I mean, they said...

1045
01:19:48,852 --> 01:19:51,187
They said, no cops.

1046
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:55,091
John, Carducci is going
to kill Bobby, anyway.

1047
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:57,927
But he's going to wait
until you're there.

We've got less than two hours.

Listen, Carducci's got
ears all over the place, even

That's easy.
