00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,309
Hey, do you have a safety pin?

3
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,576
- No. Sorry, I...
- Where's Mom?

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,742
Mom!

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,142
Right here, hon.

6
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:31,842
- Look, it broke.
- What size you need?

7
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:34,042
- I want gold.
- All right. Come here.

8
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:43,042
All right, we got a bit of
entertainment for you folks tonight.

9
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:49,009
I'm about to introduce you to
the dream team!

10
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,942
We got a parade of beauties
comin' at you, folks.

11
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,975
Right now.

12
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:06,142
Here at Moves, we're gonna
give you the opportunity to have fun

13
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,808
with any one
of our lovely ladies.

14
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,675
We got a couple ATMs
in the building

15
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,142
and we're now accepting
all major credit cards.

16
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:21,742
See our bartender,
he'll get you all signed up.

17
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:26,476
Come on, boys,
where's that energy?

18
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,476
Put a little pep in your step.

19
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:33,309
Make some noise
for the new girl.

20
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,643
New York, we got
a lot of beautiful girls.

21
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,675
Oh, we're about to get
this party cranked up a notch.

22
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,643
We got Justice getting ready
to join us on the main stage.

23
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:55,142
It's round one
of our three-song special.

24
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:57,576
Everybody, make some noise.

25
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,808
Justice is served.

26
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:10,576
Lucy Liu!

27
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,409
Hey, Lucy Liu!

28
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,209
Hey, Lucy Liu, come here.

29
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,643
This is my boy, Danny.

30
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:18,509
- You mind taking him for a good time?
- What? No.

31
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,176
- Don't be a pussy.
- No, I'm fine.

32
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:21,808
- Let's go.
- Go on, Danny.

33
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,742
- Danny, go. Come on.
- Come on.

34
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,209
- Danny! Danny! Danny!
- Get it!

35
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:29,609
Danny! Danny! Danny!

36
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,009
Who hurt you?

37
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,576
What did Daddy do to you?

38
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,742
Come on, you can tell me.

39
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:02,775
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

40
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,509
Who wants to let me
give them a dance?

41
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:08,209
- You want a dance?
- No, thank you.

42
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,675
Hello. How you doing?

43
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,609
Back off, bitch.

44
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:23,042
So, minus 40% is $287.

45
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:24,442
Minus $160.

46
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,942
You said it was $130.

47
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,975
Well, you got here after five,
didn't you?

48
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:35,942
Bye, new girl.

49
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,442
Is he bothering you?

50
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,742
Listen, he bothers you,
you got my number, right?

51
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,409
You need anything,
you call me.

52
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:44,209
Someone to talk to.
Coke. Anything.

53
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:47,643
You wanna keep working
that VIP. All right?

54
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,109
All right.

55
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,309
I love the recently-divorced.

56
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,476
I made everything I need to.

57
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:59,242
Oh, my God.
That couple that I was dancing for,

58
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:02,042
they were generous,
but his breath was, like, hot.

59
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,576
Hey there, sexy,
how you doing?

60
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,975
Figure she loses a
husband, she's gotta get surgery...

61
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,409
She got hit by a stick.
Does that count as surgery?

62
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,643
She looks like
she was sucking on a lemon.

63
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,942
All right, Grandma.
I gotta go.

64
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,909
Did you get something to eat?

65
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,942
I'm gonna eat
at the diner, okay?

66
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:40,376
What happened
to your necklace?

67
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:42,509
It's fine, Dorothy.

68
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,442
- Here.
- No, you keep it.

69
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,209
What do I need it for?
Come on.

70
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,009
You take
such good care of me.

71
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,909
I'll see you later, okay?

72
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:18,276
And now, let's
welcome to the main stage,

73
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:22,276
the one, the only... Ramona.

74
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,442
Ramona, I love you!

75
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:34,442
Doesn't money make you horny?

76
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,692
Hey, can I get a light?

77
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:20,459
Yeah.

78
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,325
Where's your coat?

79
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,058
I left it inside.

80
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,726
Yeah? Climb in my fur.

81
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:36,726
Come on.

82
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:37,893
Okay.

83
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,125
- Freeze out here.
- I know.

84
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,292
So, is Justice,
like, really a model?

85
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,292
Yeah, she'd like to think so.

86
00:08:56,692 --> 00:09:00,759
I mean, some of the girls have been
in, like, Playboy, Hustler.

87
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,859
I was a centerfold once.

88
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,426
No way.

89
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,592
'93.

90
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,526
- No fucking way.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:10,692
Oh, my God.

92
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,992
Back when Stevie Wonder
came in.

93
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:17,058
What the fuck did Stevie
Wonder come to the club for?

94
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,859
Casey had him
in the Champagne Room.

95
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:22,492
Swears to God he isn't blind.

96
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:23,759
Wow.

97
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:30,492
How come you're so good?

98
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:34,058
I see you with
every single kinda guy, and...

99
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:37,492
I don't know, it's like you
have 'em all figured out.

100
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:40,025
I guess
I'm just a people person.

101
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:45,759
You know? It's easier if you think of them
as, like, your rich friends, you know?

102
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:47,759
Some of them are not so bad.

103
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:50,925
Where else you dance?

104
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,092
I was at Sin City...

105
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,159
- for way too long.
- Mmm.

106
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:59,859
Then I heard some boiler room guys saying
how all the money was in the city, so...

107
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,893
So, you followed
the green brick road?

108
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:04,492
- Yup.
- So far so good?

109
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,592
I mean, it's okay.

110
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:07,759
Get out.

111
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,826
I mean,
you must be cleaning up.

112
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,459
You're new.

113
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,159
You're fucking gorgeous.

114
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:14,692
You're Asian.

115
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:16,992
It's like a triple threat.

116
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,793
But I'm not that good.

117
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:22,225
I mean, if I...

118
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:27,692
Maybe if you, like, I don't
know, showed me moves.

119
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,626
Maybe we could work together.

120
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:36,092
You know?

121
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,692
I could give you
a crash course in this place.

122
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,492
Introduce you
to some of my regulars.

123
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:47,359
It's just mostly Wall Street guys
looking to spend money on pretty girls.

124
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,859
What do you think of that?

125
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,025
- Yeah, that would be cool.
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,058
So, it was Ramona's
idea that you two work together?

127
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:04,826
Yes, that's right.

128
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,992
And at this point,
everything was aboveboard.

129
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,559
I mean,
I thought she was nice.

130
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:15,292
And when would you say that
things got out of control?

131
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,359
Ramona was always in control.

132
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,225
Front hook.

133
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,392
Ankle hook. Yup.

134
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,159
Knee hook.

135
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:31,726
Hold on with that knee.

136
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,058
Okay.

137
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,292
From here,
you could do the carousel.

138
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,392
Put your head back.

139
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,426
Come down.

140
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,125
You can do Peter Pan.

141
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:45,259
Knee hook.

142
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:46,626
Just spin.

143
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:50,025
Jesus Christ.

144
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,125
Then you can go
into a fairy sit.

145
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:54,225
Oh.

146
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:55,893
Stag.

147
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,958
- That's pretty.
- Reverse stag.

148
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,559
That's pretty too.

149
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,726
Scissor sit.

150
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,292
Table top.

151
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,592
I can't do that.

152
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,526
You can do that.
You're gonna do that.

153
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,692
A climb.

154
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,359
What if you don't have muscles
to do that?

155
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:16,325
- You have muscles to do this.
- I don't have any.

156
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:17,859
Every girl
has muscles to do this.

157
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:20,492
You could do this one,
this is a martini.

158
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,426
Fireman down.

159
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:28,992
Boom.

160
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:31,592
- That's... pretty good.
- Ready?

161
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:32,826
Push it, baby.

162
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:34,692
You go.

163
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:38,025
- There you go. Just point your toes.
- Okay.

164
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,259
There you go.
Hold yourself up.

165
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,659
I'm trying.

166
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,726
Try laying flat across.
Do a tabletop.

167
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:46,659
They all love seeing that.
Makes you look strong.

168
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:47,826
Okay.

169
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,592
- There you go. Yes. Okay.
- Yeah?

170
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,659
- This does hurt my vagina.
- Can you grab your foot?

171
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,626
There you go.

172
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,325
- This doesn't look sexy.
- You know what?

173
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,626
- Thumb up your butt, almost.
- Thumb up my butt?

174
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,092
- You know how to do that.
- How do I...

175
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,559
- Put your head back.
- I'm gonna fall.

176
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,325
You're not gonna fall.
Straighten your legs out.

177
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,759
- Both of them?
- Point your toes.

178
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:09,392
Yes! Yeah, point your toe.

179
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,626
Oh, my God.

180
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:19,192
We gotta get you outta those
training pumps into a good shoe.

181
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:21,092
I know.
It's hard for me to balance.

182
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,025
No. It's easier in these.

183
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,426
Hey, you know Diamond
from the Bronx, right?

184
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,292
What's up, baby-boogie-down-
fucking-Bronx-bitch?

185
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,159
Come on, she's gonna help you.

186
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,492
- You're gonna help me?
- You're gonna help us out right now.

187
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:34,692
- Get in the chair.
- Okay.

188
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,092
Get in the chair.

189
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,426
You're gonna help her learn
how to do a real dance.

190
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,526
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay. I'm good with that.

191
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,958
- Okay.
- Come on. Show me what the fuck you got.

192
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:46,958
There, that's good.

193
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,958
I really just go like that.

194
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,192
- No, wait. Wait.
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

195
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,526
- I'm trying to grind his dick.
- Arch your back more.

196
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:55,793
Oh, my. Move your hair,
look at me or something.

197
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:58,826
- Push your butt out.
- No. I know I'm hopeless.

198
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:00,192
No, look, that's it.

199
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,125
You don't have to be
the best dancer.

200
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,759
You just have to make their eyes
move just one inch. Come here.

201
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:07,225
- What do you mean?
- Let me tell you something.

202
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,225
- Show her.
- Okay.

203
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,659
Watch and learn.

204
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:11,459
- You fucking sit there.
- Sit, ma. Come on.

205
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:14,359
You drain the clock and not
the motherfucking cock,

206
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:15,659
you know what I'm saying?

207
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,459
And you just go slow.
Right there.

208
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:18,958
- Slow.
- And you look at them.

209
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,225
- Super slow.
- Uh-huh.

210
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,259
- Slower.
- A little slower.

211
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:23,592
- Slower.
- Sexier.

212
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,492
- Yes.
- And look back at it.

213
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,859
Oh, yeah. They love that.
The slower the better.

214
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:30,292
Like a motherfucking sloth.

215
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:31,692
- That's $20 right there.
- Slow.

216
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,659
Remember, drain the clock,
not the cock.

217
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,793
- Drain the clock, not the cock.
- That's it.

218
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:38,626
Come on, now you look
like you're taking a shit.

219
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,426
You can't deny she got it.
We gonna make some money tonight.

220
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,058
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

221
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,125
I said: "Are we gonna make
some fucking money tonight?"

222
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,159
Yeah!

223
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:51,492
Tracey, have you met Destiny?

224
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,092
No. Hey.
You're from Queens, right?

225
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,459
Yeah, Kew Gardens.

226
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,192
- Okay, I'm from Briarwood.
- Cool. Yeah.

227
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:57,692
Yeah.

228
00:14:57,826 --> 00:14:58,958
And this is Star.

229
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:00,025
Hi.

230
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,692
And you've gotta meet Liz.

231
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:03,626
Liz. Liz!

232
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,526
She playin' a song
for Jackie's new titties.

233
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,092
- They're double-Ds!
- Jackie got new titties?

234
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:09,893
Yeah! New titties!

235
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,025
- It's this new gummy-bear technology.
- Yes! Who did these?

236
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,325
- Dr. Bobby.
- These are good.

237
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:15,392
Isn't he amazing?

238
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:17,058
Thank God for Dr. Bobby.

239
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,192
And this is Mercedes.
This my baby.

240
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:22,259
Hi. Nice to meet you.

241
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:23,793
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Destiny.

242
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:24,859
Tracey.

243
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,159
Your boyfriend's here.

244
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,992
- What? Girl, again?
- And he's crying.

245
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,392
Crying?

246
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:30,826
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah, hon.

247
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,559
What? Girl, what's going on
with Rodrigo?

248
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:34,559
Girl, I don't know. He's
just been so jealous lately.

249
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,259
- "Lately"?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:38,292
You can't let him drop
you off. You know that.

251
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:39,826
I know.
But, like, you know how it is.

252
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,826
- At first, he liked this shit.
- Of course he did.

253
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,559
'Cause you wanna know why?

254
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:46,793
These motherfuckers think that
it's so fun to date a stripper

255
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,726
'cause it's like, "We move, and we fuck.
And we fuck the best. It's the shit."

256
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:53,826
And then, when they realize
that we work six nights a week,

257
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,759
last shit we wanna see
is their damn dicks.

258
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,359
Okay!

259
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,726
I just wanna chill on my couch
in some feetie pajamas

260
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:06,793
with my nigga, ice cream, no makeup,
and for damn sure not with these on.

261
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,225
Wait. I just make my boyfriend
masturbate beside me.

262
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:13,125
- What?
- Is that weird?

263
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,459
Shit. I haven't had sex
in two years.

264
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,092
- Oh, baby.
- Two years?

265
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,259
Well, I have a boyfriend.

266
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,626
Since when?

267
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,759
Since now.

268
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:26,325
He don't bother me.
He don't get jealous.

269
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,526
The only time he complain is when I
don't change the batteries, bitch.

270
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,359
Too bad he ain't got no money.

271
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,626
Well, bitch, I can't
have everything, can I?

272
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,992
Hey, ladies,
who wants cake?

273
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,292
Aww.

274
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:42,659
Ma, what are you doing to us?

275
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,526
You can't keep doing
this to us.

276
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:46,992
It's a little motivation
for my babies.

277
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,259
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Trying to make some extra tips.

278
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:51,859
- I wanna have a tiny, tiny little sliver.
- Teeny, teeny.

279
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:54,292
But only 'cause I know
you made it with love.

280
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:56,359
Go crazy. Get a big piece.

281
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:58,025
Everybody have a piece
of the fucking cake.

282
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,893
- Let me get my Tupperware.
- I don't want that cake.

283
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:01,325
Eat it.

284
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,826
Hey. You an investor
in this place?

285
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,192
No.

286
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,459
Then quit putting money
back into it.

287
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,292
Let the guys get fucked up.

288
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,826
First get 'em a single,
then a double, then a triple,

289
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,492
then go back to a double,
and then a single.

290
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,726
You want 'em drunk enough
to get their credit card,

291
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,859
but sober enough
to sign the check.

292
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,058
Lenny, give us a beat.

293
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,659
You got it, gorgeous.

294
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,659
According to Ramona,

295
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,826
there were three tiers
of Wall Street guys.

296
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:48,025
The guys at the bottom, they don't
do anything dirty to make money.

297
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,893
So, most of them
don't have any.

298
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,292
But if they do, you can
milk 'em for every penny.

299
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:01,492
You know,
maybe they're in a loveless marriage.

300
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:04,692
Or maybe they're single
and feeling dejected.

301
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:09,659
Either way, you can string 'em
along without getting physical.

302
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:13,392
Chuck here pays for my
apartment on the Upper East Side

303
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,659
and I've never even sniffed
his dick.

304
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,826
The guys in the middle,
they'll get their hands a little dirty.

305
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,692
But they have their limits.

306
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,726
Don't tase me, bro.

307
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,359
They dabble in greed.
But they never cross a certain line.

308
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,692
Or maybe
they're not as good at it.

309
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,359
That's why they all share
a two-bedroom in Cobble Hill.

310
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,692
But then there's
the motherfuckers on top.

311
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:42,292
You're a dickwad,
fucking pussy.

312
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:46,259
CEOs, CFOs,
investment bankers,

313
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,826
corporate raiders,
hedge funders, ax murderers.

314
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,292
Found footage.
You like it? Take a look.

315
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,092
Look familiar?
Too close to home, mama?

316
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,793
Coming straight from
the crime scene into the club.

317
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:01,459
But not through the front.
Oh, no.

318
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:04,025
These guys, they don't wanna
be written about on page six.

319
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:06,592
They come through the back.

320
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:09,859
They take the private elevator
to the one room without cameras.

321
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,726
How you feeling today?

322
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,058
Oh. Feel a lot better now.

323
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,692
- Make some money?
- Oh, yeah.

324
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:21,325
And they don't leave till they
spend $10,000, $15,000 in one night.

325
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:30,459
They can be degrading,
possessive, aggressive, violent.

326
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:32,992
And they never get
in any trouble.

327
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,359
Because everyone's willing
to cover their tracks.

328
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,925
'Cause deep down
they all want what they got.

329
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:43,859
They all wanna be on top...
where there are no consequences.

330
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,225
You're just another deal to them.
And that's all they are to you.

331
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,259
It's business.

332
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:14,559
And it's a more honest transaction
than anything else they did that day.

333
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,925
All you have to do is figure
out who you're dealing with.

334
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,692
And then play them
at their level.

335
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,259
I'm gonna do that.

336
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,526
Let me help you.

337
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:19,958
I got it.

338
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:22,292
Hold on. Wait. You gotta
spread it out a little bit.

339
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:23,759
I did.

340
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:25,592
I gotta get a bigger boot.

341
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,692
Oh, my God. Wait.

342
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:29,826
- 'Kay, hold on.
- Wait, yeah, you got it.

343
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,192
I got it!

344
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,726
She wasn't in it
to make friends.

345
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,325
- Yay!
- It just happened.

346
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:47,992
- This is fucking hot.
- It's perfect.

347
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,893
- 'Cause it's classy. And I just wanna...
- No. I love it. It's perfect.

348
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:52,426
But do you think it's too big?

349
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,092
Are you kidding me?
A bag can never be too big.

350
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,159
Come on, let's ring you up.

351
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,859
What are you looking at?
Ring it up.

352
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:05,759
Thank you.

353
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,359
There you go, baby.

354
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,592
Okay.

355
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:23,626
Ta-da! I'm designing
my own swim-line.

356
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,958
- You made these?
- Uh-huh.

357
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:28,125
I like to use
a lot of mixed media.

358
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,159
So I, like,
find leather pieces,

359
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,392
and then I get little chains
and make belts out of them.

360
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:36,025
And this right here,
these are epaulets.

361
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,925
That's French for
"little shoulders."

362
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:39,925
You know, a lot of people are
afraid to wear denim in the ocean,

363
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,392
but I swear that these get more
comfortable when they're wet.

364
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,025
Specifically salt water.

365
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:47,125
Here. Try these on.

366
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:52,859
It's gonna take some time for me
to save up the money for my label,

367
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:56,225
but I do have a client
who's a graphic designer,

368
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,159
and he mocked-up
this logo for me.

369
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,159
"Swimona."

370
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,025
It's catchy, right?

371
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,492
Did you go to school for this?

372
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:06,225
Yep. Thirteen credits
away from graduating.

373
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,692
Oh, my God.
Those look amazing on you.

374
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,025
- Yeah.
- So hot.

375
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,759
Bear Cub, is that you?

376
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,192
Mom?

377
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,793
Oh, yes.

378
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,826
Hi, my gorgeous girl.

379
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,159
Hi. How's my little genius?

380
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,626
How's that big,
beautiful brain of yours?

381
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,492
Juliet, this is Mommy's
friend, Dorothy. Say hi.

382
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:28,759
Hi.

383
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:30,058
- Oh, yeah. She's always so shy...
- Hi.

384
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,459
...unless it's a cute boy.

385
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:33,125
I'll take it from here,
Manuela.

386
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:35,292
Ay, gracias, señora.

387
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,859
Goodbye, Juju.
Te quiero mucho.

388
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:40,759
What do you want
for dinner, baby?

389
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,659
I don't wanna be dependent
on anybody.

390
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,292
Like, ever.

391
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:46,958
You know?

392
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:51,659
I just wanna be able to take care of
my grandma for the rest of her life.

393
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:54,559
Maybe go shopping
every once in a while.

394
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,426
Yeah. That's how I feel.

395
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,759
I just want my daughter to be able
to do whatever she wants, you know?

396
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:04,125
Go to whatever school
she wants, or not.

397
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:07,292
If that's what she wants.

398
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,359
I swear,
I'd do anything for this kid.

399
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:13,626
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

400
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,859
Well, that would explain
my mother.

401
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:22,159
Hmm.

402
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,459
Is that how
you would describe her?

403
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:32,859
My mother?

404
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,392
I mean Ramona.

405
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,925
How much of this
is going into the article?

406
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:45,225
- Oh, I...
- It's just, I really hope

407
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,559
it's not some story about all
strippers being thieves or whatever.

408
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,492
- Not at all.
- 'Cause they're not.

409
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:53,759
And it's things like this
that add to a stigma,

410
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,058
and I don't wanna
perpetuate anything.

411
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:58,225
- Of course.
- You gotta understand.

412
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,058
I was making
an honest living then.

413
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:01,359
Everything was good.

414
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:04,626
Everybody was happy.
Everybody was making money.

415
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:07,626
- Beautiful couch.
- I know.

416
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,526
- That's your window.
- I got my own place in the city.

417
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,426
That's your floor. Your living room.
That's your floor.

418
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,225
Yes. And, of course...

419
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:16,692
my vagina.

420
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:20,459
I helped my grandma
get out of debt.

421
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:26,025
And Ramona inspired me
to go back to school.

422
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,292
Wow!

423
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,325
I'm sorry. It's just your
penmanship is really remarkable.

424
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,259
I'm Stephen.

425
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,659
You know, I just got
a vest just like that.

426
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:37,492
- Do you?
- Yeah. I think it's really chic.

427
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:40,325
I'm really blown away
by your penmanship.

428
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:42,526
Seriously.
You could be a font.

429
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,592
Thanks.

430
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:45,325
Did you know
that they do that?

431
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:46,992
- No.
- They do.

432
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:52,159
They take your handwriting
and they make it into a font.

433
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:58,292
And then put it into your computer so
you can type with your own handwriting.

434
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,359
But I don't have a computer.

435
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,692
- Oh! Right.
- I know.

436
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:08,359
I mean, I guess that's why my
handwriting's so good, right?

437
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:14,159
Right. Right. Yes.

438
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,325
2007 was the fucking best.

439
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:27,392
Sup, bro? You good?

440
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,759
Yo. Come here.

441
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,726
Hey.

442
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,492
What's going on?
What's your name?

443
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,359
I'm Destiny.

444
00:26:38,492 --> 00:26:40,426
- Destiny, I'm Johnny. Sup?
- Nice to meet you.

445
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,259
It's nice to meet you.

446
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:45,092
Fucking unbelievable.

447
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:47,025
- Where'd that necklace come from?
- Do you fucking hear yourself?

448
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:48,092
Hey! Come here.

449
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:49,826
Welcome to my family.

450
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,392
I'm Kim Kardashian.

451
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,659
The princess
is in the building!

452
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:59,793
I made more money that
year than a goddamn brain surgeon.

453
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:04,859
And, sure, some days sucked.
Like any other job.

454
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:07,259
But other days...

455
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,859
What do you think?

456
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:13,692
If I could fuck a car...

457
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:17,025
- I'd fuck this car.
- This is fucking it.

458
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,459
This is fucking it.

459
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:20,192
- Stick with me, baby.
- Yeah, let's do it.

460
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,459
What? Yes!

461
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,659
Oh, shit.

462
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:26,292
That's my motherfucking song
right there.

463
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:30,225
Girl.

464
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,292
Get your singles ready.

465
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,592
We got a pocket full of ones.

466
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,259
I just wanna make my money
and get outta here, you know?

467
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:59,392
I have bills. I wanna go
on vacation next month.

468
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:01,559
These guys
don't mean shit to me.

469
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,826
I'm telling you right now,
Carmine.

470
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,793
If I don't make
no motherfucking money today,

471
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:09,325
I'm gonna make your life a
fucking living hell, you hear me?

472
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,992
I have to go look
in the mirror.

473
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,726
Catches in the light...
I mean...

474
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,859
I'm gonna get you some food
when I get off.

475
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:23,426
I'm gonna rub your back,
give you some pussy, go to bed.

476
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,192
All right? I'll see you.

477
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:26,692
Everybody has a job in here.

478
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:29,125
The bouncers, the house mom,
everybody but you.

479
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,292
All you do is get your fucking dick sucked
by the new bitches, rude fucking idiots!

480
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:34,659
Get the fucking stage fixed!

481
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,759
The last great night
I remember...

482
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:56,592
Bitch! Bitch!
Motherfucking Usher is here.

483
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:57,659
What?

484
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:58,925
Usher, bitch!

485
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:00,726
Go, bitch!

486
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,392
The DJ put Usher's music on.

487
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:34,492
And all the girls got
up on stage to dance for him.

488
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,325
What's your name?

489
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,058
Usher, baby.

490
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:21,392
And for one last moment...
everything was so glamorous and cool.

491
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,459
We begin our coverage tonight
of what's been called

492
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:32,492
"the worst financial crisis
in modern times."

493
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:37,092
Certainly, the largest financial
disaster in decades in this country,

494
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:40,292
and, perhaps,
the end of an era in American business.

495
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:44,793
Some of the biggest names in
American business are, tonight, gone,

496
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,292
along with a lot of money
and a lot of jobs.

497
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:49,793
The crash put
everybody out of business.

498
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:51,826
But I had other things
on my mind.

499
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,726
How am I gonna make money?

500
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,958
...lost
504 points on the day's trading.

501
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:58,692
I'll take care of you.

502
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,292
Des, look at me. Look at me.

503
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,893
I promise.

504
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:04,726
I'll take care of you.

505
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:09,325
If he's a boy,
we'll name him Johnny.

506
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,159
I hope it's a boy.

507
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:21,559
After I stopped
working, I lost touch with Ramona.

508
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,726
That's just what happens
when you have a kid.

509
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:29,092
- Get out!
- Stick to it this time then.

510
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:31,692
- Stick to it this time.
- I will! Get the fuck away from me.

511
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:33,526
Go. Leave. We don't need you.

512
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,225
- Remember you said this.
- Get the fuck out.

513
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,958
It's what you wanted.
This is what you wanted.

514
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:38,459
I don't give a shit!

515
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,092
This is the last fucking time
I'm doing this.

516
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:47,192
Hi, baby. It's okay. Shh.

517
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,626
Shh.

518
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,025
Hello?

519
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,826
Hey, Stephen. It's Destiny.

520
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,526
D... Destiny. Wh... Uh...

521
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:13,225
- Wow.
- Yeah.

522
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,526
Time flies, right?

523
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,659
Uh...
Where are you?

524
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:21,526
Well, you know,
I just got back to the city.

525
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,192
Um, I moved to Arizona
a few years ago.

526
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:28,125
- But I've missed the seasons.
- I'm just gonna take this downstairs.

527
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:30,459
And I really missed you.

528
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,793
Are you still there?

529
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:35,759
Yes, uh, I'm still here.

530
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:38,125
Um, I'm ju...

531
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,793
Do you, uh...

532
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,626
Do you need to get that?

533
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:42,958
What?

534
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:44,958
Do you need to help the baby?

535
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:48,325
No, that's my friend's baby.
I'm just watching it.

536
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,192
Listen, I really didn't mean
to bother you.

537
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:51,925
I mean, if you're not happy
to hear from me,

538
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:54,626
- I can call somebody else.
- No, no. I'm happy.

539
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,292
I just wish that you
had called sooner.

540
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,492
Fatima came back.

541
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:02,692
Who?

542
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:04,292
My fiancée.

543
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:06,793
I mean... my wife.

544
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:09,793
My fiancée became my wife.

545
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:11,893
Right. Yeah.
I know, that's how it happens.

546
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,592
- Okay. Bye, Stephen.
- If you...

547
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,392
So, your last job was in 2008?

548
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:32,526
Yes. But it's not like I was...

549
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:34,192
I mean, I had a baby.

550
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:36,325
So, I was busy doing that.

551
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,559
A year of waitressing.

552
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,958
Did you graduate high school?

553
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,325
Oh, I see here
you got your GED.

554
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,025
Five years
at Sin City Cabaret.

555
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,793
- What did you do there, exactly?
- Bartending, mostly.

556
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,259
And what about at Moves?

557
00:33:57,392 --> 00:33:58,726
Bartending, mostly.

558
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:02,726
So you really don't have
any retail experience.

559
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,292
No, not yet.

560
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,459
But that's why I'd really like
to get retail experience

561
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,325
because then I would have it.

562
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:12,559
We're really looking for
someone with retail experience.

563
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,826
Well, how am I supposed to get retail
experience without retail experience?

564
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:20,592
I mean, I sold beer.
What's the difference?

565
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,893
Baby, come here.

566
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,125
Did Nana fall asleep?

567
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:34,192
There we go.

568
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:36,259
Are you okay?

569
00:34:58,793 --> 00:34:59,826
You're in my seat.

570
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,559
I'm so sorry.

571
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:09,793
You're so pretty.

572
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,392
Another Red Bull?

573
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,392
Mom!

574
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,559
Hey! Welcome back, sweetie.

575
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:33,325
- They have you up front now?
- Yup.

576
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:35,092
What the hell happened
to this place?

577
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:36,459
2008 happened.

578
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,225
The guys
don't wanna spend money.

579
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,992
The girls
don't wanna share tips.

580
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,992
Management has taken the cameras
out of the Champagne Room.

581
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,759
And I'm up front
in customer service.

582
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:47,759
Yes, I see you. Hello.

583
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:48,893
Another Red Bull?

584
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,025
Who are these girls?

585
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,793
Russians, mostly.

586
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:54,826
They look like models.

587
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,826
They're giving blow jobs
for $300 a pop.

588
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,359
Yeah? What else you got?

589
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,659
Come on. Don't be a tease.
Are you a tease?

590
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:32,826
Feel how hard you make me.

591
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,559
We're not supposed to do that.

592
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:38,459
Oh, come on. Just stroke it.

593
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:41,426
I'll give you $100.

594
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,793
A hundred. One hundred.

595
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:46,793
Please.

596
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:49,859
Here.

597
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:51,793
Three hundred.

598
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,592
Pretty please.

599
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,492
Just for a minute. Come on.

600
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:58,492
Hey. We'll make
each other feel good.

601
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,359
All right.

602
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:23,392
When I got off the floor,
I saw that he gave me three 20s.

603
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:34,492
You don't have to believe me.

604
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:37,893
I'm used to people
not believing me.

605
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:44,492
I just wanted to tell you so that you
know where my head was at when I saw her.

606
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:06,459
Whoa.

607
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:13,826
- Oh, my God.
- There's no way.

608
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:17,159
Oh, my God,
she's fucking gorgeous.

609
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:19,292
Of course.

610
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:20,692
How old is she now?

611
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,359
Two and a half.

612
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,559
There's nothing like it,
is there?

613
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:28,958
Juliet still lets me sleep
in her bed.

614
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,426
But I just know she's gonna
throw me out any day now.

615
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,225
I missed you, you know that?

616
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:40,859
I missed you, too.

617
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:45,726
Where'd you go, baby?

618
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,659
What happened with Johnny?

619
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,426
Why didn't you call me?

620
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,159
You know that you and Lily can
always stay with me and Juju.

621
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:08,092
You know that.
No, don't do that. Come on.

622
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,159
No. Don't do that thing.

623
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:12,726
Don't do that.

624
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:15,759
It's me.

625
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:18,859
Hey.

626
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,992
You remember
what we were like back then?

627
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:25,426
Remember?

628
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,325
We were like
fucking hurricanes.

629
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,392
Weren't we?

630
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:35,826
I just need to make money
right now, though, you know?

631
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,893
I just wanna, like, be independent.
Not need anybody.

632
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,659
Just me and Lily. That's it.

633
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:44,559
She told me
what happened after the crash.

634
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:51,325
With half of Wall Street unemployed,
the club wasn't far behind.

635
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,459
Mercedes got Ramona
a job in fashion.

636
00:39:56,826 --> 00:39:58,559
I can't believe
he got arrested.

637
00:39:58,692 --> 00:40:00,659
What am I supposed to do now?
I can't afford no lawyer.

638
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:02,992
I can barely afford
his half of the rent.

639
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:07,726
It's almost enough to make me
just call off the wedding.

640
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,359
Well?

641
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,325
I mean, come on, Sadie.
And you know I love Dragon.

642
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:15,759
But do you really wanna marry someone
who's probably going to prison?

643
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:18,559
I don't know.

644
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:21,426
Three to five
is a big commitment.

645
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,893
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, what's up?

646
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:30,359
I was hoping you wouldn't mind
if I ducked out early on Fridays

647
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:31,692
to pick up my kid from school.

648
00:40:31,826 --> 00:40:33,893
She has half days
for the rest of the year.

649
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:35,793
Rest of the year? No.

650
00:40:35,925 --> 00:40:39,492
No, no. No, the rest
of the school year.

651
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,492
No.

652
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:49,325
Well, what if I got somebody
to cover my shift?

653
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:51,759
- Mercedes said that she could probably...
- Oh, my God. Come on.

654
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:54,292
Took me forever to figure out
everyone's stupid schedules.

655
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:55,893
- I know, Mark. But...
- I mean, really?

656
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:58,626
Please. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't for my kid. Okay?

657
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,426
She's going through
this difficult time at school.

658
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,925
She's at that difficult age.

659
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,325
Am I the father?

660
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:08,559
- What?
- Am I the father?

661
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:12,392
No.

662
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:14,659
'Kay. Then why
should I give a shit? Right?

663
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:18,659
Don't she got a babysitter
or a nanny or something?

664
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:21,492
I can't afford that.

665
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,659
Well, you know, if you
were putting in more hours

666
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:26,058
instead of racing outta here
all the time...

667
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,159
Right? More hours, more money.

668
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:30,893
More money, a babysitter.
Problem solved.

669
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,225
Craig's got two kids.

670
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,692
You don't see him rushing home every
time someone's got a nosebleed.

671
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,492
He's here, he's doing his shifts.
I can't do it.

672
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:57,626
Yeah.
Why don't you take a break?

673
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,826
No offense,
we're just not feeling ya.

674
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:19,559
What's wrong, baby?

675
00:42:23,893 --> 00:42:25,759
There you go.

676
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:30,259
Gonna have to dig this thing out
of there later, but...

677
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:31,759
Where'd you learn that?

678
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,726
Just some old...

679
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:37,692
What? Don't you have sisters?

680
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,759
No, my brothers
don't talk to me anymore.

681
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:51,793
I told my mom and dad that I worked here,
and they kicked me out of the house.

682
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:01,826
Wanna go fishing?

683
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,159
What's fishing?

684
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:10,492
Since the crash,
the club needs customers.

685
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,692
All we gotta do
is reel 'em in.

686
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,359
Look,
anyone can own one nice suit.

687
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:21,859
You wanna look at their shoes,
their watches, briefcases...

688
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:24,592
their wedding rings.

689
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,893
Always look for
a wedding ring.

690
00:43:27,192 --> 00:43:29,392
Jimmy,
another Glenmorangie.

691
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:32,893
Once you got 'em on the
hook, that's when we get the net.

692
00:43:33,592 --> 00:43:34,592
Bring out the flavor.

693
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:37,492
Spencer,
these are my co-workers.

694
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:40,793
What are we cheersing today?

695
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,259
To life. Cheers. Whoo!

696
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:43,893
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

697
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:51,225
- Ho-ho. What do we got there?
- You want some of that?

698
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,925
A little
Colombian marching powder?

699
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:54,692
Let me show you how it's done.

700
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:56,826
There you go.

701
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:58,526
You know what we should do?
We should go to a club.

702
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,259
We should go
to the strip club.

703
00:44:00,392 --> 00:44:02,259
I don't know.
I don't know.

704
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:04,225
- Come on.
- It's naughty.

705
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:06,192
Tomorrow we'll be
at our desks at 9 a.m.,

706
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:08,992
regretting the moment that we could've
gone to a strip club together.

707
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,759
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

708
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:11,826
I'm in.

709
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,392
Then we
steer him to the club...

710
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:17,692
- Need a ride, baby?
- Oh, yes, I do.

711
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:20,692
Get in.

712
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,559
...where we've negotiated
ourselves a percentage of his spending.

713
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:30,893
And then we run up his credit
card as far as we can push it.

714
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:33,793
Easy breezy.

715
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,259
Another round.

716
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:46,125
- Yaas.
- Yaas. Yeah!

717
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:49,325
No problem.

718
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:50,793
There we go.

719
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:52,292
- No problem.
- No problem.

720
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:53,159
Okay, you got this.

721
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:55,259
- Hey!
- Yeah, Spencer.

722
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,192
Tell the nice man
where you live.

723
00:44:57,325 --> 00:44:58,359
New York!

724
00:44:58,893 --> 00:45:00,726
Little more specific, baby.

725
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:02,025
Fifth Avenue.

726
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:03,392
Close enough.

727
00:45:04,726 --> 00:45:05,526
Hey.

728
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:06,726
- Bye, Spencer!
- Goodbye!

729
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:08,325
- Bye!
- Bye!

730
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,759
But like Ramona said,

731
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:15,192
"Going fishing doesn't mean
you catch a marlin."

732
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:22,125
And some of the guys
didn't want to party.

733
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:24,025
Oh, no. No, thank you.

734
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,626
Come on. You don't...

735
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:27,225
- Are you sure? Come on.
- I'm very sure. Thank you.

736
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,958
You don't wanna see me
after a couple of those.

737
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:30,292
Oh, boy.

738
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:31,692
And some of them caught on.

739
00:45:31,826 --> 00:45:34,359
- I can't, but this was fun.
- What? Wait.

740
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:39,726
Fuck.

741
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,559
What do we do now?

742
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,492
I'm supposed to get Dragon
a new lawyer.

743
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,759
But I can't
fucking afford it now.

744
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,559
I can't move back home.

745
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:53,592
I guess it's back to the pole.

746
00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:57,726
Sorry, Annabelle.
We'll get through it.

747
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:00,359
That's when Ramona
came up with her special recipe.

748
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:02,992
Are you serious?

749
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:05,359
It's barely any different
than what we're doing now.

750
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:07,325
It's just a shortcut.

751
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:08,592
A sure thing.

752
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:11,459
- What if someone gets hurt?
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

753
00:46:11,592 --> 00:46:13,559
The worst is
they'll have a bad hangover.

754
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:15,659
- What if somebody calls the cops?
- And says what?

755
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:19,092
"I spent $5,000
at a strip club. Send help"?

756
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:23,058
No. They won't even know what happened
until they check their bank account.

757
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:24,225
I think I'm gonna throw up.

758
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,526
Look, we're not
the only ones doing this.

759
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,726
How do you think the club
stayed in business post-2008?

760
00:46:30,992 --> 00:46:32,192
It's a side hustle.

761
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:35,192
Everybody's had to
get creative, baby.

762
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,659
I know a girl in Queens
who did it.

763
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:41,125
Did she get caught?

764
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,492
No.

765
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:44,092
She sent her two kids
to college.

766
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:45,992
And now she lives in Miami.
Opened up a nail salon.

767
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,359
Exactly.

768
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:52,793
What do you think?

769
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:56,459
What is it?

770
00:46:57,259 --> 00:46:58,992
It's ketamine and MDMA.

771
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:02,426
The ketamine wipes their memory,
the MDMA makes 'em happy.

772
00:47:02,759 --> 00:47:04,325
How many times
have you done it?

773
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:07,092
Three times.
Including tonight.

774
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:08,659
Works every time.

775
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,459
We made five grand tonight,
split three ways.

776
00:47:16,092 --> 00:47:17,392
Could make it four.

777
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:20,325
Be like old times.

778
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:29,092
Look, baby, we gotta start thinking
like these Wall Street guys.

779
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:31,626
You see what they did
to this country?

780
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:34,159
They stole from everybody.

781
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,192
Hardworking people
lost everything.

782
00:47:37,058 --> 00:47:39,426
And not one of
these douchebags went to jail.

783
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:40,925
Not one.

784
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:42,659
Is that fair?

785
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,426
You ever think about
when they come into the club?

786
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:46,859
That's stolen money.

787
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:49,459
That's what's paying for
their blow jobs.

788
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:52,125
The fucking firefighters'
retirement fund.

789
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,125
Fuck these guys.

790
00:48:01,526 --> 00:48:03,325
Look, we can't dance forever.

791
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,659
What are you gonna do?
Go back to minimum wage?

792
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,859
No, baby, this game is rigged.

793
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:14,726
And it does not reward people
who play by the rules.

794
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,893
You either gotta stand in
the corner or get in the ring.

795
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,826
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

796
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,192
Me either.

797
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,392
All right?

798
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:28,592
They would do this anyway.

799
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:31,726
We're just helping them do it.

800
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:35,125
Nobody gets hurt.

801
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:37,559
Nobody gets hurt.

802
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:40,359
So...

803
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:43,225
are you in?

804
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,659
Well, it's getting late.

805
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,793
Oh, it is? What a shame.

806
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:54,692
So, you gotta get up
early tomorrow, or...

807
00:48:55,325 --> 00:48:57,893
Let's get another drink. Hmm?

808
00:48:59,492 --> 00:49:01,592
Hey, these are my sisters.

809
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:06,859
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi!

810
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:09,159
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

811
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,392
- Hi.
- Ramona.

812
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:11,626
- I'm Gary.
- Gary, nice to meet you.

813
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,125
- Nice to meet you.
- Annabelle.

814
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:14,893
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Isn't he so cute?

815
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:16,092
Yes.

816
00:49:16,225 --> 00:49:18,159
- I'm Destiny.
- Hi, Destiny.

817
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,359
Can I have three shots?

818
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:22,426
You know who he looks like,
don't you?

819
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,925
He looks like Tom Cruise.
Right?

820
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:25,893
- No, no. I'm thinking more smooth.
- Tom Cruise.

821
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:27,793
- It's the hair.
- Tom Cruise? I don't know about that.

822
00:49:27,925 --> 00:49:29,092
I know!

823
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:30,192
- No.
- It's your smile.

824
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:31,726
It is.

825
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:33,092
- It's really good.
- A mini Bob Saget.

826
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:34,225
- Getting more Sonny.
- Yeah!

827
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,659
Sonny Bono?

828
00:49:35,793 --> 00:49:37,225
He's got
the twinkle in his eye.

829
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,159
- I know!
- Here we go, guys.

830
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:39,659
This wine yours?

831
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:41,359
- Yes, that's it. No, this is mine.
- Okay, cool.

832
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:42,958
- All right, thanks.
- Shots, ladies?

833
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:44,125
- Okay. Yes.
- Yes.

834
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:45,392
You guys are sisters?

835
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:47,092
Yeah. Same dad,
different moms.

836
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,159
To sisters!

837
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,992
To sisters.

838
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,559
To sisters.

839
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:09,325
Just put him here right now.

840
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:10,859
He dead?

841
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:13,526
Oh, shit. We going to jail. Damn.

842
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:15,492
- Oh, my God.
- Help her.

843
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:17,592
- Oh, my God.
- Does this always happen?

844
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,025
No.

845
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,659
- Did we give him too much?
- I don't know.

846
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:23,392
Gary. Gary. Baby.

847
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:25,359
Gary, wake up. Wake up, Gary.

848
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:27,492
- Gary.
- Oh, Gary.

849
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:29,292
- Open your eyes.
- We love you, Gary.

850
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,025
- Gary! Wake up, Gary.
- Fuck.

851
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,459
Open your eyes, baby.

852
00:50:32,592 --> 00:50:34,492
- Wake up, Gary! Wake up!
- Open your eyes.

853
00:50:36,058 --> 00:50:36,992
There you go.

854
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:38,325
What was that, Gary?

855
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:40,826
- Another round, Gary?
- What are we gonna do?

856
00:50:41,526 --> 00:50:43,292
What do you want?
Isn't this fun?

857
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:46,292
- Uh.
- That's it, baby.

858
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:47,426
That's it, Gary.

859
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:48,925
Come on. Yeah, Gary.

860
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,826
That's it, baby. Get it.

861
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:52,492
- There you go.
- Come on.

862
00:50:52,626 --> 00:50:53,793
This one right here?
There you go.

863
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,259
- You can do it.
- Come on. Come on.

864
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:57,793
What do you want, baby?

865
00:50:57,925 --> 00:50:59,459
Which one is it? That one?

866
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:00,925
You need help?

867
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,459
This one? That pretty
gold one right here?

868
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,759
That's the one?

869
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:10,726
Wow. Oh, my...

870
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:23,559
To Gary!

871
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:24,692
Yes!

872
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:31,025
The worst are the guys who go to
the bathroom and put on a condom,

873
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:35,125
and then you know
you got to grind it out.

874
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,426
So disgusting.

875
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,392
We don't have to go back.
Do we?

876
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:41,225
- Do we have to go back?
- No, baby. Your dancing days are over.

877
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,759
- Yeah?
- You guys,

878
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:45,025
- I can pay off my grandma's house.
- Yeah!

879
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:47,626
- I'm getting myself a new engagement ring.
- That's so sweet.

880
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:50,426
And Dragon's ass can stay in
jail for a few more weeks.

881
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,426
Or a month. Or a year.

882
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,192
- To Gary.
- To Gary!

883
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:55,392
- To Gary.
- I love Gary.

884
00:51:55,526 --> 00:51:56,692
- God bless Gary.
- To Gary.

885
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,025
- I love you, Gary!
- To Gary.

886
00:51:58,159 --> 00:51:59,893
- I love you, Gary.
- Mom?

887
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:02,025
Hi, baby.

888
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,292
Hi, what happened?
Who woke you up?

889
00:52:04,426 --> 00:52:06,626
Who was it?
Some crazy lady woke you up?

890
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:07,793
What happened?

891
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:11,492
You guys are my real sisters.

892
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:13,459
- I love you like you're my sisters.
- Yeah. Sisters.

893
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:14,925
- I love you.
- I love you.

894
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:16,092
Love you.

895
00:52:16,692 --> 00:52:18,793
- You know I love you though.
- Yes.

896
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:19,859
We are a family now.

897
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:21,025
Yeah.

898
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:23,159
A family with money!

899
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:25,192
Yeah!

900
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:29,626
What are we gonna do? We're gonna
go shopping tomorrow? Yes, we are!

901
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,826
Hit the Electric Slide.

902
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:40,359
Okay. I know it sounds bad
to say that we were drugging people.

903
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:44,426
But you gotta understand,
in our world, this was normal.

904
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,692
I mean, half these guys are
mainlining coke on their way to work.

905
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:50,426
But we still wanted to make it
as safe as possible.

906
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,058
So, I suggested
that we tweak the recipe.

907
00:52:53,492 --> 00:52:56,459
So, what do you think?
Sixty MDMA, forty ketamine?

908
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,159
That sounds good.

909
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:05,192
Do we turn the liquid into a powder?
Or do we turn the powder into a liquid?

910
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,159
It's hot.

911
00:53:23,392 --> 00:53:25,626
Eh, eh, eh.

912
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:58,292
Let's try it in the oven.

913
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:02,592
Mm-hmm.

914
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:05,659
Yes.

915
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,592
How much?

916
00:54:11,893 --> 00:54:13,292
Just a sprinkle.

917
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:18,893
You know, I'm still not sure
about strangers.

918
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,659
Well, that's the beauty of it,
baby, they're strangers.

919
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,893
Yeah, but I don't wanna slip it to
anybody who's not already on something.

920
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:28,559
We gotta know that
these guys like to party.

921
00:54:28,692 --> 00:54:30,225
And that they've got money.

922
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:32,925
Enough not to care
if some of it's missing.

923
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:35,359
With strangers,
it's unpredictable.

924
00:54:35,793 --> 00:54:36,893
No guarantees.

925
00:54:37,893 --> 00:54:39,893
So, we called up
some old friends.

926
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:44,793
Okay.

927
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:47,125
David, is that you?

928
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:48,925
It's Ramona.

929
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:50,692
Get some.

930
00:54:50,826 --> 00:54:52,225
Well, I can send you
a picture to jog your memory.

931
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:54,092
Okay, I'll send it right now.

932
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:56,992
Come on.
Come on, give it to me.

933
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,359
No. Turn around.
You know what they want.

934
00:54:59,492 --> 00:55:01,359
- You're into that good time.
- It's a sure thing.

935
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:03,526
That's good.
That's a good angle.

936
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:06,392
- My baby.
- Now we wait.

937
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:08,058
You killed it.

938
00:55:10,325 --> 00:55:12,058
Uh...

939
00:55:42,925 --> 00:55:45,492
This was too fucking easy.

940
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,225
Hi, David.

941
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:50,125
Yeah, I can bring
some of my friends.

942
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:54,626
David, these are my sisters.

943
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:59,626
Hi.

944
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:00,893
Annabelle.

945
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,526
- David. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

946
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,726
- David.
- David. Nice to meet you.

947
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,259
Mercedes. Like the car.

948
00:56:06,392 --> 00:56:07,925
Mercedes, how are you?

949
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:09,726
- We should get some drinks.
- Ooh, yes.

950
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:11,359
Shots, please.

951
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:36,726
Come on. You can do it.

952
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:37,958
Hey!

953
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:39,893
You okay?

954
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:42,359
Don't fall down now.

955
00:56:58,526 --> 00:57:00,526
- Yes!
- One more time!

956
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:02,526
Whoop Whoop! Whoop!

957
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:05,159
Too much, bitch.

958
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:12,859
Let me see,
let's do number four.

959
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:18,925
It says, "The brain evaluates
data collected from weather..."

960
00:57:19,058 --> 00:57:20,092
Mercedes.

961
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:21,492
So good to see you.

962
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:23,426
Dragon's gonna be okay.

963
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:39,058
Maybe one of 'em would call
and complain, but we could handle it.

964
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:41,992
What are you talking about?
You had an amazing time.

965
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,325
You were so happy.

966
00:57:43,459 --> 00:57:45,125
You kept tipping everybody,
remember?

967
00:57:45,259 --> 00:57:46,925
Ramona could always handle it.

968
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:49,292
What are you gonna do?
Call the police?

969
00:57:49,426 --> 00:57:52,025
You really gonna tell your wife
and the police what you did?

970
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:54,859
You think that's worth
whatever amount you're missing?

971
00:57:55,259 --> 00:57:57,526
No, you went out.
You had an epic night.

972
00:57:57,893 --> 00:57:58,992
It costs money.

973
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:01,225
Why should it cost you
any more than that?

974
00:58:01,893 --> 00:58:02,925
Too cute.

975
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:05,459
We treated it like a business.

976
00:58:05,592 --> 00:58:08,859
So, we'll have Annabelle meet J.P.
Morgan and Mercedes meet Wells Fargo.

977
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:11,225
Mercedes met Wells Fargo
last time.

978
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,159
How much did we
charge last time?

979
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:16,526
$5,000 on his American Express
and $2,000 on his corporate card.

980
00:58:17,492 --> 00:58:19,225
Does he have
any airline miles?

981
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:21,259
- Let's check.
- Worth a look.

982
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:23,159
We invested in ourselves.

983
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,159
- Yes.
- Ooh.

984
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:26,826
The dolls are here!

985
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,192
Do I look expensive?

986
00:58:28,325 --> 00:58:30,159
You look very expensive.
And baby got back.

987
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:32,125
That dress is hugging you
in all the right places.

988
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,659
We expanded our clientele.

989
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:35,726
What did you say
that you did again?

990
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:36,958
I am an architect.

991
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,692
Oh.

992
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:42,793
- No wonder your hands are so... nice.
- Strong hands.

993
00:58:42,925 --> 00:58:45,592
But the bigger the bank
account, the greater the expectations.

994
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:47,659
Let's go fuck in the bathroom.

995
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:50,426
Uh, my sisters are gonna
be here in a couple minutes.

996
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,259
Let's just wait
for them, okay?

997
00:58:52,392 --> 00:58:53,958
All right. Tick tock.

998
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:55,659
The guys were getting
more and more aggressive,

999
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:57,826
and the four of us
could only take on so much.

1000
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:58,893
So, that's when I said...

1001
00:58:59,025 --> 00:59:00,559
We need to be outsourcing.

1002
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:03,893
Let's put an ad in Craigslist.

1003
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:06,359
So, we put an ad
in Craigslist.

1004
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,826
Does anybody have
any allergies?

1005
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:15,426
And by this, I mean
really serious allergies.

1006
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:18,325
Like, life-threatening
allergies. Yeah?

1007
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:20,025
I have asthma.

1008
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:21,859
- All right.
- I don't like feet.

1009
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,793
You have a foot allergy?

1010
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:27,492
No. I'm just saying if a foot
goes near my face, I'll shut down.

1011
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:29,626
- I don't mind feet.
- Okay.

1012
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:34,025
Now, we're gonna work on our fake
sniffing and our fake drinking.

1013
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:36,459
- Where were you?
- They had an Orange Julius.

1014
00:59:36,592 --> 00:59:39,192
All right. That's good.
That's better with the nail.

1015
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,426
What's Coco doing here?

1016
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:42,492
We said no junkies
and no criminals.

1017
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:43,592
So?

1018
00:59:43,726 --> 00:59:45,526
So, she's a junkie
and a criminal.

1019
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:48,159
- People change.
- I'm not entirely convinced.

1020
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:50,759
Hon, you're not...

1021
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:53,893
Fine. But I promised
I'd buy her lunch.

1022
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,692
Oh!

1023
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,325
Who is this? What are you
doing at the mall?

1024
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:00,859
This is Mr. Bruce.

1025
01:00:01,392 --> 01:00:02,958
Mr. Brucey!

1026
01:00:03,092 --> 01:00:05,225
I take him everywhere with me.
I hope that's not a problem.

1027
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,626
Not at all. Not at all.

1028
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,992
Oh, my God! Hi!

1029
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,426
- Look at these fucking bags, bitch.
- Let me see!

1030
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,259
- Take this bag in, bitch.
- Yes!

1031
01:00:35,392 --> 01:00:37,125
No drinking, no drugs.

1032
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:40,225
And after you get the signature,
then you can party your asses off.

1033
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:43,192
What's your
social security number?

1034
01:01:45,058 --> 01:01:47,392
Sexy numbers. Sexy numbers.

1035
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:49,225
What's your mother's
maiden name?

1036
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:52,793
- My mother's middle name?
- Maiden.

1037
01:02:35,392 --> 01:02:36,992
Flyest dog
in the neighborhood.

1038
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,426
Yes! Yes!

1039
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,759
Check it! Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

1040
01:02:41,893 --> 01:02:42,826
Here we go.

1041
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:43,992
Chicken wings.

1042
01:02:44,492 --> 01:02:46,292
This is gonna be spicy?

1043
01:02:46,426 --> 01:02:48,058
Just chicken wings. You can't
ever go wrong with chicken wings.

1044
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:49,526
On the bone. It's good.

1045
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:51,793
I get 'em extra crispy.
We can make 'em wet.

1046
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:52,992
Sauce on the side?

1047
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:54,426
Bitch.

1048
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:56,759
Six-six-one-zero.
And what's my balance?

1049
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:00,692
I could've worked
on Wall Street.

1050
01:03:07,058 --> 01:03:10,759
There were nights and weekends when
we brought 100 grand into the club,

1051
01:03:10,893 --> 01:03:12,659
and everybody
got in on the action.

1052
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:23,359
The hosts, the managers, the DJ.
They all got their cut.

1053
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:36,592
Without us making the
effort to go out and promote,

1054
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,492
the club wouldn't have had
a business.

1055
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,259
We weren't just some
disposable dancers anymore.

1056
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:49,025
I was CFO
of my own fucking corporation.

1057
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:23,025
Be careful with that.
Do not fuck up my door.

1058
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,325
Look at this.

1059
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:25,659
Welcome to my apartment.

1060
01:04:25,793 --> 01:04:28,759
My God! The penthouse, bitch.

1061
01:04:28,893 --> 01:04:30,325
How crazy is this?

1062
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:36,726
Oh, my God.

1063
01:04:39,325 --> 01:04:40,559
Oh, my God.

1064
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:42,592
I'll teach you how to use it.

1065
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:50,492
Dorothy, what have you done?

1066
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:52,826
Well, you always said
you wanted real pearls.

1067
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,759
Did you go to the bottom
of the ocean for this?

1068
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:57,025
Yeah. Something like that.

1069
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,392
What is it?

1070
01:04:58,759 --> 01:04:59,859
Oh, my goodness.

1071
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:02,893
Mommy, it's the one I wanted.

1072
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,426
Thank you
to your Aunt Ramona.

1073
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,359
Thank you, Aunt Ramona.

1074
01:05:07,492 --> 01:05:09,359
You're welcome,
my little baby girl!

1075
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:11,626
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1076
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:17,292
I got the red-bottoms. I got
the red-bottoms. Yes, girl!

1077
01:05:17,426 --> 01:05:19,626
- Ooh.
- These are nice.

1078
01:05:19,759 --> 01:05:20,559
Thank you.

1079
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:22,025
You're welcome, my love.

1080
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:23,859
- Okay, okay.
- Right here.

1081
01:05:23,992 --> 01:05:25,459
This one's for you.

1082
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:26,392
For me?

1083
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:27,893
Oh, yes. Here we go.

1084
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,292
Uh-huh.

1085
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,659
What do we got?

1086
01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:35,526
Oh, my God.
It's gorgeous.

1087
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:37,459
- So classy.
- You like it?

1088
01:05:37,592 --> 01:05:38,259
No.

1089
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,925
I love it! I love it.

1090
01:05:40,058 --> 01:05:42,559
I'm gonna carry all my other bags in it.
It's so amazing.

1091
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:44,793
Oh, my God. Thank you, baby.

1092
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:47,992
Okay.
I have something for you.

1093
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:51,159
- Do I get the big one?
- Yes, I chose this just for you.

1094
01:05:52,058 --> 01:05:53,359
Okay.

1095
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,192
- Wow, it's heavy.
- Yeah.

1096
01:05:56,992 --> 01:05:58,359
Okay. What do we got?

1097
01:05:58,626 --> 01:06:00,092
- Open it up.
- It's a big one.

1098
01:06:01,426 --> 01:06:02,859
Oh, my Lord.

1099
01:06:05,793 --> 01:06:06,592
What was it?

1100
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:08,692
- Chinchilla.
- Oh, my God.

1101
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:12,492
Oh, my God!

1102
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:14,459
Yes.

1103
01:06:14,992 --> 01:06:16,359
You're the best.

1104
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,559
I'm so proud of you.

1105
01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:24,726
- We don't need anybody else, do we?
- Mm-mm.

1106
01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:26,192
- Nobody.
- No.

1107
01:06:26,426 --> 01:06:27,893
We're the untouchables.

1108
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,492
Like Kobe and Shaq.

1109
01:06:30,826 --> 01:06:31,859
Who gets to be Kobe?

1110
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:33,325
- I'm Kobe. You're Shaq.
- I'm the Kobe.

1111
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:35,225
- No. I don't wanna be Shaq.
- No.

1112
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,592
How are you Kobe when there can
only be one Kobe? And I'm the Kobe!

1113
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:39,592
- Double Kobe!
- I'm the Kobe!

1114
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:41,726
Okay, everybody.

1115
01:06:41,859 --> 01:06:43,759
Come on. Get on top of
each other. Get together.

1116
01:06:44,259 --> 01:06:45,893
Come on.

1117
01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:47,526
Get close. Get cozy.

1118
01:06:47,659 --> 01:06:49,559
- I wanna get in the middle.
- In, in.

1119
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:52,925
Now say money!

1120
01:06:53,058 --> 01:06:54,092
Money!

1121
01:06:56,793 --> 01:07:00,125
And, God, thank you for
everything that you've given us.

1122
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:01,893
This delicious food.

1123
01:07:02,426 --> 01:07:04,726
My new Louboutins.

1124
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:07,159
And... for this family.

1125
01:07:07,826 --> 01:07:09,159
My sisters.

1126
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:11,659
We are so blessed.

1127
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:13,659
Amen.

1128
01:07:13,793 --> 01:07:16,893
- Amen.
- Amen.

1129
01:07:24,092 --> 01:07:25,726
Try some of this pork, baby.

1130
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:35,392
I don't usually get
nervous around these types.

1131
01:07:35,526 --> 01:07:36,992
No, you're good.

1132
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,659
No, they come
into the club all the time.

1133
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:40,459
But I had a crush on this guy
since I was 15.

1134
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:43,259
So, I was like, "Oh, my God."
And suddenly, he's there.

1135
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,925
Nan, do you know who he is?

1136
01:07:45,058 --> 01:07:46,759
You know. You must've
seen him in Us Weekly.

1137
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:48,958
She knows who he is.
Nan, you know who he is.

1138
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:50,325
The guy from the movies.

1139
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:51,925
I've seen him.

1140
01:07:52,058 --> 01:07:53,759
He's very good-looking.

1141
01:07:53,893 --> 01:07:55,793
Yeah!

1142
01:07:55,925 --> 01:07:57,793
Well, let me tell you something: he's
even more good-looking in person.

1143
01:07:57,925 --> 01:07:59,259
I am telling you.

1144
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:02,092
Anyway, so he picks me up
in this white Porsche.

1145
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:03,526
- No way.
- Yeah.

1146
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:05,392
And all he tells me
is to wear a hat.

1147
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:07,793
- Fucking Kentucky Derby.
- Yes! That's what I thought!

1148
01:08:07,925 --> 01:08:10,058
- That's what it was, right?
- That's what I thought.

1149
01:08:10,192 --> 01:08:11,559
That's what I thought.

1150
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:13,392
But then, all of a sudden,
we're at the airport.

1151
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:15,359
We're boarding
this private jet

1152
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:16,726
- to Monaco.
- Oh, my God.

1153
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,859
There was champagne,
lobster, a butler.

1154
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:22,626
And I just didn't have the heart
to tell him, like, I hate flying.

1155
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:28,526
So, there I am in this gorgeous marble
bathroom, 10,000 feet in the air,

1156
01:08:28,659 --> 01:08:30,159
vomiting lobster
and champagne.

1157
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,025
Sit here, baby. You know,
Annabelle can vomit on cue.

1158
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:36,692
- It's one of her many gifts.
- It's not intentional.

1159
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:38,692
You're so good though, baby.

1160
01:08:38,826 --> 01:08:42,159
So, thank God,
finally, this plane lands.

1161
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:47,459
And we proceed to have three of the most
amazing hours I have ever had in my life.

1162
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:50,659
Until the paparazzi shows up,
ruins everything.

1163
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,893
And I have to say:

1164
01:08:52,526 --> 01:08:54,826
That's the end of the PG-13
version of this story.

1165
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:57,426
- Ooh!
- Oh, no. You gotta give us more. Come on.

1166
01:08:57,559 --> 01:08:59,192
Details, please. Tease, baby.

1167
01:08:59,325 --> 01:09:02,592
I once danced
with Frankie Valli.

1168
01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:04,492
What? Nana.

1169
01:09:04,793 --> 01:09:08,259
- Did... Did you know this?
- No. What?

1170
01:09:08,392 --> 01:09:10,559
It was before he got married.

1171
01:09:10,925 --> 01:09:12,125
The second time.

1172
01:09:12,492 --> 01:09:13,659
I don't know, Nan.

1173
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:16,626
I don't know about that.
Are you sure?

1174
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:17,925
Pretty sure.

1175
01:09:18,058 --> 01:09:19,592
You're not really sure.

1176
01:09:19,726 --> 01:09:22,225
My God, this woman
is my spirit animal!

1177
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:44,492
Okay, Nan.

1178
01:09:45,325 --> 01:09:46,958
All right. Tell the truth.

1179
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:51,726
Frankie Valli shows up on your
doorstep on your wedding day.

1180
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:55,359
And he says,
"Me or your husband."

1181
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,192
What do you say?

1182
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,726
"Which car do you drive?"

1183
01:10:01,259 --> 01:10:03,025
How have we not met sooner?

1184
01:10:03,392 --> 01:10:04,992
How have we not met sooner?

1185
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,793
How have we not met sooner?

1186
01:10:07,192 --> 01:10:08,659
Oh, my God.

1187
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,392
So, getting back
to the drugging.

1188
01:10:19,259 --> 01:10:21,259
Is that
what you're hung up on?

1189
01:10:21,793 --> 01:10:22,859
It's hard not to be.

1190
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:27,692
What'd you say
your name was again?

1191
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,426
Elizabeth.

1192
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,626
And did you grow up
with money, Elizabeth?

1193
01:10:32,526 --> 01:10:34,992
We were... comfortable.

1194
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,426
So, what did your parents do?

1195
01:10:36,559 --> 01:10:37,726
My dad was a journalist.

1196
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,325
My mom's a psychiatrist.

1197
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:41,626
And where'd you go to school?

1198
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,325
Brown. For undergrad.

1199
01:10:44,459 --> 01:10:46,526
What would you do for $1,000?

1200
01:10:47,192 --> 01:10:52,626
Of course, the answer is gonna depend on
what you already have and what you need.

1201
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,492
- So, the...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1202
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,359
I don't think I should
even talk to you anymore.

1203
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:01,426
It's just, I don't know you.

1204
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:04,826
And I'm sorry, these girls are
just like my sisters, so...

1205
01:11:05,325 --> 01:11:07,492
That's okay. I understand.

1206
01:11:08,925 --> 01:11:10,559
Ramona said the same thing.

1207
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:13,492
You talked to Ramona?

1208
01:11:13,626 --> 01:11:14,659
Yeah.

1209
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:16,759
When?

1210
01:11:16,992 --> 01:11:17,958
Yesterday.

1211
01:11:18,092 --> 01:11:19,025
Where?

1212
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:20,526
I went to her work.

1213
01:11:25,025 --> 01:11:26,259
What?

1214
01:11:27,925 --> 01:11:29,793
Oh, nothing. It's just...

1215
01:11:30,759 --> 01:11:33,192
the idea of Ramona Vega
trying to go straight.

1216
01:11:33,325 --> 01:11:34,659
That's like...

1217
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:42,392
Well, I mean, if you talked to her,
what do you need to talk to me for?

1218
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,426
I was just hoping that you could
fill in some of the blanks.

1219
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:49,325
"Blanks"?

1220
01:11:52,592 --> 01:11:53,492
Okay.

1221
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:55,259
Where was I?

1222
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:03,259
Fucking copycats.

1223
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:08,793
Look, I don't think
we need 'em anymore.

1224
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,159
Need who?

1225
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,659
The club.

1226
01:12:13,526 --> 01:12:15,859
Why should we split anything
when we can have it all?

1227
01:12:17,592 --> 01:12:21,192
After she cut out the club,
we had to meet our clients in hotel rooms.

1228
01:12:21,325 --> 01:12:23,626
- Or in their homes upstate.
- Where the fuck are they?

1229
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:25,359
Annabelle's feeling
grossed-out lately.

1230
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:26,925
A lot of the girls
stopped showing up.

1231
01:12:27,058 --> 01:12:29,159
And what about Mercedes?
Is she feeling "grossed-out"?

1232
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:32,726
We can't keep giving them their cut if
they're not showing up for weeks on end.

1233
01:12:34,793 --> 01:12:37,025
We need a bigger crew.
I'm gonna call Coco.

1234
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:39,058
No! She's a junkie.

1235
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:41,292
Fine.
What about Georgia?

1236
01:12:41,426 --> 01:12:42,826
She just got out of jail.

1237
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:43,793
Trixie?

1238
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:45,092
She's still in jail.

1239
01:12:45,225 --> 01:12:47,692
Ramona,
quit bringing home strays.

1240
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:50,325
We're breaking the law here.
We don't wanna work with criminals.

1241
01:12:50,459 --> 01:12:53,492
I didn't know how much I love
red hair until I saw you standing there.

1242
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:56,025
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- So amazing.

1243
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,526
- I wish it was natural.
- I might dye my hair.

1244
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,092
Hey, Dorothy. This is Dawn.

1245
01:13:00,225 --> 01:13:01,526
Hi.

1246
01:13:09,325 --> 01:13:10,925
As soon as I saw her, I said,

1247
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:14,759
"Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.
You have to join us."

1248
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:17,058
And she said... Tell 'em what you said.

1249
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,958
I said, "What is it?
Like, a cult?"

1250
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:27,225
It kinda is
a cult. A little bit.

1251
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:29,992
It's like, if we're a
team, and we're making money,

1252
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,958
and we're winning games,

1253
01:13:32,092 --> 01:13:35,025
do you suddenly start trading
players and bringing in new people?

1254
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,092
No, right?

1255
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:37,958
Think I'm gonna buy these.

1256
01:13:38,092 --> 01:13:39,426
Where the fuck is she?

1257
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:41,392
Relax. She's a pro.

1258
01:13:43,559 --> 01:13:46,659
Two-four-three-seven.

1259
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,893
Two-four-three-seven.

1260
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,859
Two-four-three-seven.

1261
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:54,592
Two-four-three-seven.

1262
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,192
Three-seven.

1263
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:02,859
Yeah.
We can meet at five or six.

1264
01:14:03,325 --> 01:14:05,092
No, six is good.
Six is good.

1265
01:14:05,392 --> 01:14:06,392
You want five?

1266
01:14:06,793 --> 01:14:08,159
- Make a decision.
- Two-four...

1267
01:14:08,292 --> 01:14:10,259
You've got three seconds.
One, two...

1268
01:14:10,592 --> 01:14:12,659
Yeah,
I'm gonna fucking get these!

1269
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:14,893
Size 8, please, ho.

1270
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,292
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Six o' clock or seven?

1271
01:14:18,426 --> 01:14:20,225
Two-four-three-seven.

1272
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:23,859
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Hurry the fuck up.

1273
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,592
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Jesus fucking Christ. Come on!

1274
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:29,426
Um, two-four-three-seven.

1275
01:14:29,992 --> 01:14:30,992
Good girl.

1276
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:33,225
I got you.

1277
01:14:34,559 --> 01:14:36,125
Told you she was a pro.

1278
01:14:36,259 --> 01:14:37,893
Dawn was no pro.

1279
01:14:38,192 --> 01:14:40,125
She was a cokehead. A felon.

1280
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:43,859
- She was reckless and sloppy. And stupid.
- With the blue tie?

1281
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:46,526
- She was out of control.
- I don't know. I've never seen him.

1282
01:14:46,659 --> 01:14:49,992
Ramona didn't care, as long as
she was making money.

1283
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,526
What's my credit limit, again?

1284
01:14:52,526 --> 01:14:53,559
$50,000?

1285
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,659
Let's do it for the full 50.

1286
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,859
We're never gonna
see him again.

1287
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:01,359
Who cares?

1288
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:03,559
Yes. Thank you.

1289
01:15:03,692 --> 01:15:06,392
It wasn't long before
she burned through our regulars,

1290
01:15:06,526 --> 01:15:08,992
which left us with
unpredictable strangers.

1291
01:15:09,826 --> 01:15:11,826
- Where is he?
- Out back.

1292
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,692
What the fuck happened?

1293
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:18,159
He said
he could dive off the roof.

1294
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,692
And I said he couldn't.

1295
01:15:19,826 --> 01:15:21,826
Well, you were right.
Where's Georgia?

1296
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,459
She took off.

1297
01:15:23,592 --> 01:15:25,459
Where the fuck is Ramona?
This is her client!

1298
01:15:25,592 --> 01:15:27,292
I couldn't get in contact
with her.

1299
01:15:28,726 --> 01:15:29,826
My God.

1300
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,259
All right. Come on.
Help me get his legs.

1301
01:15:31,392 --> 01:15:32,793
I... Is he dead?

1302
01:15:32,925 --> 01:15:34,025
Not yet.

1303
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,659
We're not gonna kill him,
are we?

1304
01:15:35,793 --> 01:15:37,325
No, we're gonna take him to the hospital.
Come on. Help me.

1305
01:15:37,459 --> 01:15:40,292
- Okay.
- Help me get him. Lift.

1306
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:41,859
What the fuck?

1307
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:45,225
- You can do it. Come on.
- No, no, no.

1308
01:15:46,426 --> 01:15:47,659
Get the door!

1309
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:53,192
I got him.
I got him.

1310
01:15:53,325 --> 01:15:56,559
Okay. You gotta help me with his torso.
Come on. Careful. Careful.

1311
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:58,559
- Ready?
- Don't scratch his booty.

1312
01:15:58,692 --> 01:16:00,592
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

1313
01:16:01,092 --> 01:16:02,192
Fuck!

1314
01:16:05,793 --> 01:16:07,292
God, I'm sorry.

1315
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:10,192
Okay. Call Ramona and don't
stop calling till you get her.

1316
01:16:10,325 --> 01:16:12,893
- Okay.
- I'm gonna fucking kill her.

1317
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:17,259
Has she texted back yet?

1318
01:16:17,592 --> 01:16:18,692
No.

1319
01:16:19,025 --> 01:16:20,325
Can't believe her.

1320
01:16:21,859 --> 01:16:23,225
Hey, slow down. Five-O.

1321
01:16:29,192 --> 01:16:30,159
Oh, shit!

1322
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:33,893
Guys. You guys!

1323
01:16:34,225 --> 01:16:35,826
- I'm sorry.
- Just chill.

1324
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,659
- Stay cool.
- I am.

1325
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:42,526
Oh, my God.

1326
01:17:01,793 --> 01:17:03,793
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- No, that's fine.

1327
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:06,459
I don't know
why that happens.

1328
01:17:16,659 --> 01:17:18,426
Mercedes, come on. Help me.

1329
01:17:19,325 --> 01:17:20,459
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1330
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:22,292
Jesus Christ.

1331
01:17:22,426 --> 01:17:24,025
- Help me get him out.
- Where are you taking him?

1332
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,392
We're gonna take him inside.

1333
01:17:25,526 --> 01:17:26,426
I thought we was
just gonna leave him here.

1334
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:27,925
We can't just leave him.

1335
01:17:28,058 --> 01:17:29,025
I'm not going inside.

1336
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:30,392
Mercedes, this is a business.

1337
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:31,559
No!

1338
01:17:33,025 --> 01:17:34,392
Mercedes!

1339
01:17:37,793 --> 01:17:38,626
Oh, fuck!

1340
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:39,793
Help, please!

1341
01:17:39,925 --> 01:17:41,992
Help! Help!

1342
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,192
- Help!
- Here they are.

1343
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,025
Please, help my husband.

1344
01:17:46,392 --> 01:17:47,859
Help my husband!

1345
01:17:47,992 --> 01:17:50,426
- All right...
- I'm gonna flip on three.

1346
01:17:50,893 --> 01:17:52,192
Please hurry!

1347
01:17:56,225 --> 01:17:57,859
I'll be right back. Come on.

1348
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:13,859
Lily!

1349
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:16,826
Lily!

1350
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:20,526
- Monica!
- Are you still here?

1351
01:18:21,692 --> 01:18:22,626
Lily!

1352
01:18:22,759 --> 01:18:23,793
Fuck.

1353
01:18:53,592 --> 01:18:54,626
Come on.

1354
01:18:57,559 --> 01:18:59,125
Oh, my God.

1355
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,958
- There's Mommy.
- I'm so sorry.

1356
01:19:01,092 --> 01:19:02,426
- Hi, baby.
- Hi!

1357
01:19:02,559 --> 01:19:04,092
...you were stealing money.

1358
01:19:04,225 --> 01:19:05,692
That's funny.

1359
01:19:05,826 --> 01:19:07,426
- Hey. The babysitter had to go home.
- Funny.

1360
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:09,259
But we had ourselves
a fun sleepover, didn't we?

1361
01:19:09,392 --> 01:19:10,958
- Oh, yeah? I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1362
01:19:11,092 --> 01:19:12,626
Come on, Lily. Here we go.

1363
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:16,659
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, I got her, Amy. Thanks.

1364
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:20,159
Sweetie, we're almost there.

1365
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:43,893
Why are we walking
so fast, Mommy?

1366
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:00,259
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye. Be good.

1367
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:12,793
So where was Ramona
when I needed her?

1368
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:15,958
Bailing out Dawn again.

1369
01:20:16,392 --> 01:20:18,092
Are you kidding me?
Let me buy you lunch, baby.

1370
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:20,559
- Yeah? You're so good to me.
- Yes, of course.

1371
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:31,659
- Don't ever fucking call me again.
- Baby.

1372
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:51,225
Come Friday, we're looking at sunny
skies with a high of 78 degrees.

1373
01:20:51,859 --> 01:20:54,559
On the weekend,
we got scattered showers...

1374
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:13,492
I'm sorry
I wasn't there, baby.

1375
01:21:23,659 --> 01:21:24,692
I know.

1376
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:36,859
I don't wanna go home.

1377
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:41,392
Do you and Lily
wanna stay with us?

1378
01:21:43,025 --> 01:21:44,259
Yeah.

1379
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:45,659
Okay.

1380
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:54,192
You know, I'm supposed to meet
someone tonight if you wanna join me.

1381
01:21:54,759 --> 01:21:56,759
I mean,
take your mind off things.

1382
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:01,125
Ain't no pressure,
just, you know...

1383
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:04,659
If you need the money.

1384
01:22:07,058 --> 01:22:09,292
Could be a big one.

1385
01:22:11,325 --> 01:22:13,092
I knew it had to stop.

1386
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:17,659
I kept thinking that there
was, like, this magic number.

1387
01:22:18,793 --> 01:22:21,159
You know,
if I could save enough money,

1388
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:23,359
I could start clean.

1389
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:25,459
Just me and Lily.

1390
01:22:26,925 --> 01:22:30,392
Maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody.

1391
01:22:30,759 --> 01:22:33,259
Is that what happened
with Doug ####?

1392
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:36,759
Uh...

1393
01:22:36,893 --> 01:22:38,692
I don't really remember
a Doug ####.

1394
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:41,659
- Ramona said...
- Well, Ramona's a liar.

1395
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:45,925
She'll say anything
to make herself look better.

1396
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:48,192
I mean,
what did she say about me?

1397
01:22:48,325 --> 01:22:50,192
I'm sure she had a lot to say.

1398
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:51,925
What'd she say?

1399
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,492
She said you had
a tough time growing up

1400
01:22:54,626 --> 01:22:56,826
and that you spent
a lot of time alone.

1401
01:22:58,325 --> 01:23:00,392
You got into fights and...

1402
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:04,359
had some bad boyfriends.

1403
01:23:05,793 --> 01:23:06,826
Okay. What else?

1404
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:13,459
That your parents were immigrants,
and that when your father left,

1405
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:16,859
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents' house.

1406
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:19,793
And never came back.

1407
01:23:21,925 --> 01:23:23,159
Is that true?

1408
01:23:28,192 --> 01:23:31,859
I mean, I thought that she was
just taking a break, you know?

1409
01:23:34,626 --> 01:23:38,192
I thought that, you know,
sometimes moms need a break.

1410
01:23:40,092 --> 01:23:42,359
Why would she tell you all that?

1411
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:46,958
I think she just wanted me
to understand that, for you,

1412
01:23:47,092 --> 01:23:49,359
this wasn't about revenge.

1413
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,459
You were just trying
to make friends.

1414
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,325
Destiny.

1415
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:05,159
I know I'm supposed to think
that what you did was terrible

1416
01:24:05,292 --> 01:24:06,958
and that these guys
didn't deserve it.

1417
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:11,159
But to tell you the truth,
I don't feel sorry for them.

1418
01:24:11,992 --> 01:24:14,325
Well, I feel sorry for them.

1419
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:20,826
You know,
I keep having this nightmare.

1420
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:25,025
Right? Where, like, I'm in
the back seat of this car.

1421
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:26,192
This moving car.

1422
01:24:26,925 --> 01:24:31,292
And I realize that nobody
is driving the car.

1423
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:36,392
And I have to get to the front seat
to try to stop it, and I go there,

1424
01:24:36,526 --> 01:24:40,125
and no matter what I do,
I can't get a grip on it.

1425
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:42,159
And I can't, like, stop it.

1426
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:45,659
And then I wake up.

1427
01:24:48,893 --> 01:24:51,225
What happened
between you and Ramona?

1428
01:24:52,559 --> 01:24:54,459
Why aren't you
talking anymore?

1429
01:25:43,893 --> 01:25:45,092
Hello?

1430
01:25:45,225 --> 01:25:47,392
So Ramona met Doug years ago.

1431
01:25:48,092 --> 01:25:50,692
Doug's friend took him to the
club to blow off some steam

1432
01:25:50,826 --> 01:25:52,592
after a few
devastating events.

1433
01:25:52,726 --> 01:25:54,492
I don't know
that it is gonna be okay.

1434
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,492
How could it get worse?

1435
01:25:57,626 --> 01:26:00,426
Which included his
house being destroyed by a fire.

1436
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,125
And separating from
the mother of his young son.

1437
01:26:07,759 --> 01:26:10,859
She never really wanted
to have kids, you know?

1438
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:14,759
So, I think when we found out
he was autistic,

1439
01:26:14,893 --> 01:26:17,992
I think she just
couldn't handle it, you know?

1440
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:19,392
He was nice.

1441
01:26:19,826 --> 01:26:22,893
We talked about our kids.
We talked about our exes.

1442
01:26:23,292 --> 01:26:25,359
- We had a heart-to-heart.
- Drinks!

1443
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:28,559
Here we go.
That one's for you.

1444
01:26:28,692 --> 01:26:30,125
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1445
01:26:30,259 --> 01:26:31,859
So, what happened to Doug?

1446
01:26:33,426 --> 01:26:36,459
So, what I miss?
What are we doing tonight?

1447
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:38,726
Um...

1448
01:26:38,859 --> 01:26:40,159
Uh...

1449
01:26:40,925 --> 01:26:43,225
The room was round.

1450
01:26:46,025 --> 01:26:48,559
There was a table.

1451
01:26:50,793 --> 01:26:53,025
They maxed out
my corporate card...

1452
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:57,793
so my company launched
an internal investigation,

1453
01:26:58,259 --> 01:26:59,692
and I was fired.

1454
01:26:59,992 --> 01:27:02,459
Can you please just
credit back my debit card?

1455
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,526
My mortgage payment's
on there.

1456
01:27:05,025 --> 01:27:07,726
What are you talking about?
You were having a great time.

1457
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:10,893
Why are you doing this to me?

1458
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:15,793
Please, I have nothing.
I can't...

1459
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:18,826
I can't afford to not pay
my mortgage.

1460
01:27:21,058 --> 01:27:22,292
My s...

1461
01:27:22,793 --> 01:27:23,859
My son...

1462
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:27,159
I'm really sorry.

1463
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:29,426
Put the phone down, Destiny.

1464
01:27:32,559 --> 01:27:34,793
- Put it away.
- Just give me a second.

1465
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:36,292
Don't. What the...

1466
01:27:36,426 --> 01:27:38,793
- Gimme the phone.
- Get off of me!

1467
01:27:38,925 --> 01:27:40,559
- Hey!
- Stop!

1468
01:27:40,692 --> 01:27:44,259
- If we don't do it, someone else will.
- Get off of me.

1469
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:46,359
Gimme that fucking phone.

1470
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:51,492
Ungrateful little bitch.

1471
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:26,192
Precinct.

1472
01:28:26,325 --> 01:28:27,592
Yes, hello. I...

1473
01:28:27,726 --> 01:28:30,292
I went to a strip club
and I was drugged.

1474
01:28:38,793 --> 01:28:39,859
Precinct.

1475
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:41,492
I was drugged,
and I have proof.

1476
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:44,192
It was weird.

1477
01:28:44,325 --> 01:28:45,459
It was real weird.

1478
01:28:45,592 --> 01:28:47,159
If it hadn't been
for the tape,

1479
01:28:47,292 --> 01:28:49,392
I would've been like, "Dude,
you're fucking full of shit."

1480
01:28:49,626 --> 01:28:52,225
Please.
I just wanna know what happened to me.

1481
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:54,526
Um...

1482
01:28:54,659 --> 01:28:56,925
You were fleeced, that's all.

1483
01:28:57,225 --> 01:28:58,925
By who?

1484
01:28:59,726 --> 01:29:02,659
Um... Well,
we're, like, a little gang.

1485
01:29:03,325 --> 01:29:04,659
You were just a target.

1486
01:29:04,793 --> 01:29:06,893
We just gave you
a little sprinkle.

1487
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:08,526
I'll tell you everything.

1488
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:10,925
I'll tell you everything
I know, I promise.

1489
01:29:11,058 --> 01:29:12,492
I know a lot. I really...

1490
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:14,726
I'll tell you everything.
I just don't wanna go back.

1491
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:16,426
So, was there a sting?

1492
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:17,626
One, two. One, two.

1493
01:29:17,759 --> 01:29:19,492
Hello, police.
Can you hear me?

1494
01:29:19,626 --> 01:29:21,292
I'm about to open the door.

1495
01:29:22,058 --> 01:29:23,826
- Hey, did you bring the drugs?
- Shh.

1496
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:25,958
- Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

1497
01:29:29,692 --> 01:29:31,559
Look, like,
I don't think that he likes me.

1498
01:29:31,692 --> 01:29:34,325
So, I don't know,
I think one of you is gonna have to do it.

1499
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:35,592
Are you high?

1500
01:29:35,726 --> 01:29:36,759
- What?
- Give her a break.

1501
01:29:36,893 --> 01:29:38,726
No. Me?

1502
01:29:38,859 --> 01:29:41,459
No, no. No. No. I don't do
that kind of stuff anymore.

1503
01:29:41,592 --> 01:29:43,492
That's just... it's not me.

1504
01:29:44,592 --> 01:29:46,259
- Hey, hey, ladies.
- Hey.

1505
01:29:46,392 --> 01:29:48,225
Christmas come early.

1506
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:50,259
Hey, these are my friends
that I told you about.

1507
01:29:50,392 --> 01:29:52,225
- Hi, friends.
- This is Ramona.

1508
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:54,125
- Ramona. Hi.
- Ramona. Hi.

1509
01:29:54,259 --> 01:29:55,793
- This is...
- And I'm Rhonda.

1510
01:29:55,925 --> 01:29:57,992
- Rhonda. You are both very attractive.
- Rhonda. Yeah.

1511
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,459
Thank you.

1512
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:03,025
Okay. Why don't you
take a seat right here.

1513
01:30:03,592 --> 01:30:05,325
We're gonna fix you a drink.

1514
01:30:05,459 --> 01:30:08,225
- So, you stay there, okay?
- You get one too. Shots? I don't know.

1515
01:30:08,359 --> 01:30:09,592
We'll see about that.

1516
01:30:18,925 --> 01:30:21,626
Just a second. Hmm.

1517
01:30:21,759 --> 01:30:23,759
Hope you're thirsty.

1518
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:31,426
- Do it.
- No, just go ahead.

1519
01:30:32,259 --> 01:30:33,492
Go on.

1520
01:30:34,259 --> 01:30:36,292
You found him. Go ahead.

1521
01:30:42,058 --> 01:30:43,559
Hi.

1522
01:30:44,225 --> 01:30:45,225
Here you go.

1523
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:47,826
Yum, yum, yummers. Slàinte.

1524
01:30:49,793 --> 01:30:50,826
So, who's excited?

1525
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:53,392
I'm telling you,
it's the same fucking car.

1526
01:30:53,526 --> 01:30:55,225
You're being paranoid.

1527
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:57,958
No, I saw the same fucking Buick
parked outside the Gansevoort.

1528
01:30:58,092 --> 01:30:59,925
It's not a Buick.

1529
01:31:00,058 --> 01:31:02,958
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's been following us for 20 minutes.

1530
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:05,826
- Dawn was setting us up back there.
- Dawn?

1531
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,626
Now I know you're paranoid.

1532
01:31:08,759 --> 01:31:11,526
You really think that she wouldn't
sell you out to save herself?

1533
01:31:12,559 --> 01:31:14,426
So, there was a sting?

1534
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:19,058
We cannot comment on that
at this time.

1535
01:31:19,192 --> 01:31:21,292
But what we can tell you

1536
01:31:21,426 --> 01:31:24,559
is the amount of people that were willing
to talk to us was so small it was absurd.

1537
01:31:25,092 --> 01:31:26,793
Why?

1538
01:31:26,925 --> 01:31:29,559
I guess men don't wanna admit
what happened to them, you know?

1539
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:31,826
Being victimized by a woman.

1540
01:31:32,592 --> 01:31:34,426
So, we did some investigating,

1541
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:35,958
and we found
the Connecticut architect

1542
01:31:36,092 --> 01:31:39,125
who Moves said
failed to pay a $135,000 bill

1543
01:31:39,259 --> 01:31:41,526
he racked up during
four visits to the club.

1544
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:44,592
"For a night of pleasure
he can't even remember."

1545
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,426
What a boob.

1546
01:31:46,559 --> 01:31:48,592
"And went back
three more times"?

1547
01:31:50,392 --> 01:31:51,793
I guess he must've liked it.

1548
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,092
You know,
when you look at it out of context,

1549
01:31:55,225 --> 01:31:56,292
it seems like
he's making it up.

1550
01:31:56,426 --> 01:31:58,159
You're a family girl?

1551
01:31:58,292 --> 01:32:00,058
You look like my brother.

1552
01:32:00,192 --> 01:32:01,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1553
01:32:01,259 --> 01:32:02,592
- You like that?
- No.

1554
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:04,759
Why I'm here. I mean,
it's not about the money.

1555
01:32:04,893 --> 01:32:07,526
It's about the next guy
this happens to,

1556
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:09,826
and, like, I gotta
do something to stop that.

1557
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:13,392
But when you put it
together with Doug, it all added up.

1558
01:32:13,626 --> 01:32:15,893
Peter.
Peter, these are my sisters.

1559
01:32:17,459 --> 01:32:19,692
Oh, yes!

1560
01:32:20,992 --> 01:32:22,058
Scary, isn't it?

1561
01:32:23,459 --> 01:32:26,492
I mean, we got so spooked,
none of us went back to the club anymore.

1562
01:32:40,492 --> 01:32:41,925
Hey, Ramona.

1563
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:43,559
How you doin', girl?

1564
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:18,225
Put your hands up.

1565
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:19,659
Don't move.

1566
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:20,859
Hands where we can see 'em.

1567
01:33:22,058 --> 01:33:23,659
Did you hear him?
Put your hands up.

1568
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:26,058
Hands up! Let's go!

1569
01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:27,992
Let go of the money.

1570
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:30,159
Give it up, Ramona.
It's over. Let go of the money.

1571
01:33:37,025 --> 01:33:38,559
Yeah, I like that.

1572
01:33:39,325 --> 01:33:40,626
Keep that right here.

1573
01:33:40,759 --> 01:33:42,159
I tried to get
one that you would like.

1574
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:43,526
You did.

1575
01:33:49,726 --> 01:33:51,659
You know, I'm not usually
happy to see your kind.

1576
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,392
But when I see you,
I know I'm gonna see my man.

1577
01:33:55,392 --> 01:33:58,793
Just a little bit... longer.

1578
01:34:33,025 --> 01:34:34,559
I'm sorry.

1579
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,192
Come on.

1580
01:35:11,793 --> 01:35:12,526
Hey.

1581
01:35:12,659 --> 01:35:14,058
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

1582
01:35:14,426 --> 01:35:16,659
Which one
of you is the ringleader?

1583
01:35:20,559 --> 01:35:21,893
This is unbelievable.

1584
01:35:22,025 --> 01:35:23,359
You guys are really something,
you know that?

1585
01:35:23,492 --> 01:35:24,793
Does Tony know about this?

1586
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,426
Take a seat, Miss Vega.

1587
01:35:27,058 --> 01:35:28,092
This is crazy.

1588
01:35:28,392 --> 01:35:29,659
We didn't do anything wrong.

1589
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:32,659
You know, Tony wouldn't let this happen.
I'm gonna text him.

1590
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:34,325
Who gave her her phone back?

1591
01:35:34,459 --> 01:35:36,826
Think about your daughter.

1592
01:35:38,325 --> 01:35:40,492
You're facing
felony charges here.

1593
01:35:41,259 --> 01:35:43,559
You really wanna go down
for someone else?

1594
01:35:44,893 --> 01:35:47,859
Come on. You want Lily
to grow up without her mother?

1595
01:35:48,692 --> 01:35:50,859
You think
these girls are your friends?

1596
01:35:51,492 --> 01:35:53,559
You don't think
they're gonna rat you out?

1597
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:56,025
Think about your daughter.

1598
01:35:56,925 --> 01:35:58,759
Mercedes is probably gonna use
Dragon's lawyer.

1599
01:35:58,893 --> 01:36:01,159
So, you, me and Annabelle
should probably lawyer up.

1600
01:36:01,992 --> 01:36:04,925
Do we know any lawyers from the club?
That guy, Jeremy? Or maybe Anton?

1601
01:36:05,058 --> 01:36:06,359
I took the deal.

1602
01:36:12,025 --> 01:36:13,359
You did?

1603
01:36:20,526 --> 01:36:22,659
Have I taught you
fucking nothing?

1604
01:36:27,259 --> 01:36:30,426
You fucking idiot!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1605
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:32,559
Why would you do that?

1606
01:36:32,692 --> 01:36:34,125
For Lily.

1607
01:36:45,492 --> 01:36:49,659
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1608
01:36:56,793 --> 01:36:58,692
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

1609
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:13,192
I'm sorry.

1610
01:37:17,559 --> 01:37:19,692
We were fucking hurricanes,
weren't we?

1611
01:37:19,826 --> 01:37:21,125
Yeah.

1612
01:37:39,826 --> 01:37:41,925
- Hello?
- Hi. Um...

1613
01:37:42,058 --> 01:37:43,826
Hi, Elizabeth. It's Destiny.

1614
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:46,192
Hey, Destiny. How are you?

1615
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:47,893
I'm good. I'm really good.

1616
01:37:48,025 --> 01:37:49,759
Lily's great. Um...

1617
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:52,992
Oh, I put the house up for sale.
We're moving back to Queens.

1618
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:55,426
You know, I've been making
a ton of new friends.

1619
01:37:55,559 --> 01:37:57,793
And, oh, I met this guy who...

1620
01:37:57,925 --> 01:38:01,025
He's gonna help me get
a job in pharmaceuticals.

1621
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:03,125
So I'm really excited
about that.

1622
01:38:06,259 --> 01:38:08,025
- Are you still there?
- I'm here.

1623
01:38:08,526 --> 01:38:10,459
So, I was just reading
the article again,

1624
01:38:10,592 --> 01:38:15,225
and maybe the reason
why we did what we did

1625
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:18,759
is because hurt people
hurt people, you know?

1626
01:38:19,925 --> 01:38:21,826
Yeah. No, I understand.

1627
01:38:25,793 --> 01:38:28,159
So, have you talked
to Ramona lately?

1628
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,192
No, just that one time.

1629
01:38:32,492 --> 01:38:34,292
- Have you?
- No.

1630
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:36,626
Um...

1631
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:40,392
Can I just ask you...

1632
01:38:42,992 --> 01:38:45,225
Like, what else
did she say about me?

1633
01:38:45,692 --> 01:38:47,759
So, I used to live
in the Bronx back then.

1634
01:38:47,893 --> 01:38:51,626
But I was seeing this guy who had a
walk-up right next to where I stripped.

1635
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,159
So, I was staying at his
place, like, every night.

1636
01:38:54,292 --> 01:38:57,492
But one morning, I go back to my
place, and the door's wide open.

1637
01:38:57,626 --> 01:39:00,259
And I was freaked out, you know?
I was like, "Oh, my God. All my stuff.

1638
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:04,159
All my valuable stuff is in this
place that I'm not even sleeping in."

1639
01:39:04,292 --> 01:39:06,992
So, now I just carry everything
with me everywhere I go.

1640
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:08,592
Let me show you.

1641
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:11,225
Let's see.

1642
01:39:11,893 --> 01:39:12,925
This.

1643
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:17,259
This is a patch from my grandpa's uniform.
He was in the navy.

1644
01:39:18,192 --> 01:39:19,392
Oh!

1645
01:39:19,526 --> 01:39:22,626
This is my...
my grandma's wedding ring.

1646
01:39:22,992 --> 01:39:25,459
Isn't that pretty?
And this one was my mother's.

1647
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,225
It's the three birthstones
of me and my sisters.

1648
01:39:28,359 --> 01:39:30,826
The ruby's me.
I was a July baby.

1649
01:39:31,058 --> 01:39:34,492
I have two sisters. One lives in
Arizona, the other one lives in Texas.

1650
01:39:34,626 --> 01:39:39,025
We try to get together once a year,
but with the kids, it's impossible.

1651
01:39:39,159 --> 01:39:40,459
Do you have kids?

1652
01:39:40,692 --> 01:39:41,626
Not yet.

1653
01:39:41,759 --> 01:39:42,992
Well, don't worry.
You're young.

1654
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:44,958
And you have amazing skin.

1655
01:39:47,392 --> 01:39:48,726
Is that you?

1656
01:39:49,793 --> 01:39:52,659
That's me.
I was 15.

1657
01:39:54,626 --> 01:39:56,692
A senior
had asked me to the prom.

1658
01:39:57,192 --> 01:39:58,459
I look terrified.

1659
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,192
I like the dress, though.

1660
01:40:01,259 --> 01:40:03,992
And this here,
this is Dorothy.

1661
01:40:04,392 --> 01:40:06,359
Wasn't she the cutest?

1662
01:40:08,025 --> 01:40:09,492
Who could leave that baby?

1663
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:13,559
You know, we used to say,

1664
01:40:13,793 --> 01:40:16,992
"If only we had known
each other back then."

1665
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,359
You know?

1666
01:40:20,626 --> 01:40:24,726
Maybe we could've...
looked out for one another.

1667
01:40:25,925 --> 01:40:28,459
Maybe our lives
would've been different.

1668
01:40:29,759 --> 01:40:30,793
You know?

1669
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:34,793
Or maybe it would've
just been the same.

1670
01:40:35,759 --> 01:40:36,793
Who knows?

1671
01:40:38,325 --> 01:40:40,292
But I like to keep her
with me.

1672
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:58,159
What else you wanna know?

1673
01:41:27,526 --> 01:41:29,692
You should
give her a call, Destiny.

1674
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:33,793
Yeah.

1675
01:42:11,726 --> 01:42:13,325
Look, there's nothing
I can really say

1676
01:42:13,459 --> 01:42:16,159
to make sense
of what went down.

1677
01:42:16,925 --> 01:42:18,392
But everybody's hustling.

1678
01:42:19,793 --> 01:42:20,925
This city...

1679
01:42:21,426 --> 01:42:24,592
Fuck, this whole country
is a strip club.

1680
01:42:26,459 --> 01:42:31,159
You got people tossing the money...
and people doing the dance.

1681
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:39,826
One last time, everybody,
let's hear it for our girls!

1682
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:41,259
- Hit it!
- Okay?

1683
01:42:44,259 --> 01:42:45,859
Whoo!

1684
01:42:51,192 --> 01:42:52,492
Oh!

1685
01:42:53,325 --> 01:42:55,225
Whoo!

1686
01:42:59,992 --> 01:43:03,459
One, two, three, four!
Go. Go. Go.

1687
01:43:05,992 --> 01:43:10,492

1688
01:43:16,459 --> 01:43:17,826
That's it, folks.

1689
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:20,826
It was fun while it lasted.

1690
01:43:25,925 --> 01:43:27,692
See me on your way out,

1691
01:43:27,826 --> 01:43:30,826
I'll be selling excuses for why
there's glitter on your pants.

1692
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:41,492
We got a lot of ladies
in the house tonight.

1693
01:43:41,859 --> 01:43:44,759
Must be a bachelorette party
going on.

1694
01:43:49,392 --> 01:43:51,459
There is no flash photography
here at Moves.

1695
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:54,592
In fact
no flashing of any kind.

1696
01:44:02,492 --> 01:44:04,058
It's time to go home
gentleman.

1697
01:44:04,192 --> 01:44:06,692
The girls are not coming
back out.

1698
01:44:13,125 --> 01:44:16,859
On behalf of Moves, make sure
you tip your waitresses,

1699
01:44:16,992 --> 01:44:18,793
and get home safe.

1700
01:44:22,325 --> 01:44:24,125
Good night everybody.

1701
01:44:24,592 --> 01:44:26,426
I'm sure I will see you again.

1702
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:27,793
Real soon.
