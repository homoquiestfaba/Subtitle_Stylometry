0
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,165
Ngabo, did you finish packing?

1
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,968
* We love our Rwanda *

2
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:29,688
* We love our country *

3
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:42,300
* We love the mountains
of Rwagasabo *

4
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:55,477
* We love the parents *

5
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,515
* The parents of Rwanda. *

6
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,503
Give us a lift, old man.

7
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,928
Give us a lift, old man.

8
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,774
We just started,
and you're already sitting?

9
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,940
lt will take us all day
to get a lift.

10
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,461
You're gonna start
talking to me like that?

11
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,362
You spent all
of our bus ticket money.

12
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,900
This is your fault.

13
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,974
But l would hope
we'd be in this together.

14
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,374
We deal with it together.

15
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,608
Well, we have no choice now.

16
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,912
We'll keep walking
and see what happens.

17
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,677
Maybe this one will stop.

18
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,693
Oh my God, it stopped.

19
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,346
Wait for me.

20
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,463
That's where the money went.

21
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,365
You spent it on this.

22
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:05,419
How do we answer them
if they ask us where we're going?

23
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,957
We'll say we're on a journey
to find a job.

24
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:23,541
How long has it been
since you've been home?

25
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,015
Three years.

26
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,214
Three years, really?

27
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,514
l don't know where
my mom is now.

28
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,586
Let me see if she's
in the valley, digging.

29
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,858
Who is it?

30
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,730
Guess who this is.

31
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,203
Sangwa, it's you, my son.
How are you?

32
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,900
lt's really you?

33
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,302
My son, how are you?
l missed you.

34
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,147
Oh, praise God.

35
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,585
- Where were you living?
- Kigali.

36
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,953
You were gone
and it was painful for me.

37
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,582
You were in Kigali?

38
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,523
That's good.

39
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,060
You're looking very healthy.

40
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,221
You think so?

41
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,822
l was always
wondering about you.

42
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,833
And what were you up to?

43
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,199
Actually, we're on
a journey now.

44
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,830
We just wanted
to drop by and say hello.

45
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,271
A journey?

46
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,603
- Where to?
- For work.

47
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:41,204
No no, now l have found you.

48
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,748
l won't let you go again.

49
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,011
l'll give you something to eat.

50
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,586
Mom, you brought me milk?

51
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,249
lt's milk for my son.

52
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,817
lt's been a long time.

53
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,487
Thank you.

54
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,963
Kill your thirst.

55
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,331
lt's good because
it's the dry season, l think.

56
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,032
Yeah, it tastes good.

57
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,440
My son, l'm so happy.
l missed you.

58
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,172
l missed you too, Mom.

59
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,182
Have a taste too.

60
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,185
l brought something
for you, Mom.

61
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,312
- What is it?
- Fabric.

62
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,250
Thank you, my son,
it's beautiful.

63
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,522
l got you something else too.

64
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,120
Really? And what is it?

65
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,995
This fabric is wonderful.

66
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,261
l bought you soap
to wash it.

67
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,064
Thank you so much.

68
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,131
Dad, how are you?

69
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,138
Dad, you have to forgive me.

70
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,404
Tell me,

71
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,784
how can you leave for years?

72
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,788
You were gone for three years

73
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,348
without coming back to us...

74
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,396
to see how we are doing

75
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:42,526
or to help your younger siblings
get an education.

76
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:47,061
l'm struggling alone
with sickness,

77
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,403
and instead of helping,

78
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,000
you left home.

79
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,071
What good
did this do for you?

80
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,208
Now without any shame...

81
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,583
you come to me.

82
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,188
What can you say after all this?

83
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,318
Now tell me,

84
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,955
what do you think about this?

85
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,966
What's running
through your mind?

86
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,461
You're not ashamed?

87
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,565
For me,

88
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,938
l can't understand it.

89
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,811
You should have been aborted.

90
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,649
Really, you have no shame?

91
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,357
What can l do?

92
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,497
What can l do?

93
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,527
You should be ashamed.

94
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,143
What can l do?

95
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,812
What do you think?

96
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,447
l can see now

97
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,494
where this is going to lead you.

98
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,223
lf you don't cooperate
with your father,

99
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,028
then who will you work for?

100
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,843
l'm going back inside.

101
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,846
l don't know

102
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,348
what's in your mind.

103
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,680
Maybe you'll tell me

104
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,777
that you're still young.

105
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,846
l was young,
but learned to be a man.

106
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,051
l'm doubtful
that you'll do the same.

107
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,185
Do you think
you can help yourself?

108
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,695
Don't rely on your height.

109
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,863
lf you don't work for us,

110
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,962
for your parents and family,

111
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,531
at your young age...

112
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:10,544
Do you think living like that
is honorable?

113
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,180
l'm going back inside.

114
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,272
Gwiza, is it you?

115
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,540
How are you, Gwiza?

116
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,740
Yes l am fine.

117
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,214
How is everything?

118
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,386
l hope everything is great.

119
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,251
Things are coming along.

120
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,153
This is a friend
who came with me.

121
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,556
His name is Ngabo.

122
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,459
How are you?

123
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,524
- How are things?
- Good.

124
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,499
What are you doing now?

125
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,975
l left my gerry can there.
l want to draw water.

126
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,276
l want to draw water
for my home.

127
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,680
You want to get water?

128
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,185
l think we need water too.

129
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:26,384
Mom, give me the gerry can.
l'll get water with Gwiza.

130
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,057
Let's go together.

131
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,357
You want to?

132
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,831
Yeah, we'll keep
each other company.

133
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,803
Ngabo, let's all go together.

134
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,531
So, Sangwa,

135
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,167
why do you both
look so unhappy?

136
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,275
We're okay.

137
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,406
You're fine?

138
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,189
Before you came here...

139
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,697
there was a lady
named Mukandori.

140
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,199
She had this goat,

141
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,500
and it astonished all the people
a few days ago.

142
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,402
How?

143
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,466
lt gave birth
to four little goats.

144
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,532
Four goats?

145
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,843
Yes, and one had
an udder like a cow.

146
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,613
The second had feet like a cat.

147
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,185
The third had chicken feet.

148
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,986
That's not true.

149
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:11,792
A journalist came and discovered
something else the hard way--

150
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,265
the fourth one
had teeth like a dog.

151
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:19,395
Not true. You're lying.

152
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,939
These are your own stories.

153
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,373
lt really happened?

154
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,411
Yeah, it happened.

155
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,614
These are stories
you're inventing.

156
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,580
As you can see,

157
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,851
things haven't
been easy these days.

158
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,258
The soil is dry,
and there's no grass on the fields,

159
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,389
no avocados in the trees,
no bananas.

160
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,866
See that old lady there?

161
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,336
She normally cultivates near her home,
but there's nothing there.

162
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,203
And you've been gone
for three years.

163
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,243
We missed you here.

164
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,834
Same with me.
l missed you too.

165
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,539
Ah, no no.

166
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,342
Three years is too long
to be away.

167
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,350
But you know, Sangwa,

168
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,818
your dad has changed
these days.

169
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,916
He's changed.
No more drinking.

170
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,758
lt's a change--
no smoking.

171
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,820
That's good.

172
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,958
Now he spends his time at home,
not at the bar.

173
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,562
Sangwa, son, come here.

174
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,003
What is it, Mom?

175
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,305
Okay, l'm coming.

176
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,415
l'll sit here.

177
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,617
Sit, my son.

178
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,199
Let me give you food.

179
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,404
Eat this.

180
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,941
Thanks, Mom,
but l can serve myself.

181
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,323
l have a problem.

182
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,560
You told me
you're on a journey.

183
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,127
Where are you going?

184
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,198
Yeah, that's right,
we're on a journey.

185
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,642
We're looking for work.

186
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,979
lf you couldn't find
work in Kigali,

187
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,643
where else can you find it?

188
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,653
l will try everywhere.

189
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,951
God will help us.

190
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,288
And that friend,

191
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,160
who is he?
Where is he from?

192
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,563
Him?

193
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,534
His name is Ngabo.

194
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,836
l met him and he
became my friend.

195
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,606
He's my best friend.

196
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,510
And you're traveling with him?

197
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,778
Why don't you just stay?

198
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,755
That's impossible.

199
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,987
l have to look for a job.

200
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,198
l don't understand.
l'm wondering about you.

201
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,194
Don't worry.

202
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,757
Ngabo,

203
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:40,196
l want us to stay
one more night.

204
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,734
Did you forget that we're
on our way to kill a man?

205
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,609
l know, but let's
stay one night.

206
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,946
We can leave tomorrow,

207
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,418
and we'll go after that man.

208
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,778
Sangwa, that's how you dig?

209
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,951
Tell me, that's how you dig?

210
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,806
* The hoe *

211
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,468
* The hoe *

212
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:35,445
* l make a stick for my hoe *

213
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,245
* And then it digs well *

214
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,218
* The hoe. *

215
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,688
Sangwa,

216
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,190
are you being serious?

217
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,454
Do you call that digging?

218
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:55,430
Can't you dig
like a young man?

219
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,101
Watch,

220
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,571
that's how it's done.

221
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,303
Like this, Dad?

222
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,004
That's right.

223
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,944
That's how
a young man should work.

224
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,703
Why aren't you working?

225
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,576
Tired.

226
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,639
You're tired?

227
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,412
Tell me...

228
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,818
where are you from?

229
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,219
Kigali.

230
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:03,023
No, that's not true.
You're not from Kigali.

231
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,594
l'm from the west.

232
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,530
The west?

233
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,627
When l was young,

234
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,432
l was living

235
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,837
near Kibuye.

236
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,610
You were living near Kibuye?

237
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,081
When was the last time
you saw your parents?

238
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,777
The genocide.

239
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,944
The genocide...

240
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,594
You know, sometime back,
l saw this chicken.

241
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,394
lt was looking for a bride.

242
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,835
You know what it was wearing?

243
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,396
A blue t-shirt,
green pants, and boots.

244
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,466
l was really shocked.

245
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,915
And you know what else?

246
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:03,250
lt had a best man.
You know what it was wearing?

247
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:07,690
lt was going on its way...

248
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,196
wearing very tight trousers.

249
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,423
Where is it from?

250
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,830
The chicken?

251
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,265
From Bwanakeli.

252
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,636
Papa, Sangwa, should we go home?
We're tired.

253
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,390
You were working
very hard today.

254
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,024
Yeah, it wasn't easy.

255
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,306
You told me
your father was bad.

256
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,004
You really think working like this
will change anything?

257
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,449
While l'm here,
l want to work hard,

258
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,681
make him happy.

259
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,188
What's the point?

260
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,488
We'll be leaving soon.

261
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,473
Sangwa, l wanted
to tell you both...

262
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,511
there is no food today.

263
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,640
l don't know
what you will do.

264
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,843
That's okay.

265
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,318
Can we go out?

266
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,021
Sure, let's go.

267
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,314
Why are you
taking the bag?

268
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:14,750
We're just going out.
We won't be long.

269
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,994
Do you think
doing this to a man

270
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,360
is good?

271
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,866
But this is a tree.

272
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,427
lt's different with a man.

273
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,568
Ngabo,

274
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:52,480
this is where my friends and l
used to play.

275
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,363
Ngabo, why are you so quiet?

276
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,834
l want us to leave.

277
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:25,271
But l wanted us to stay
one more night.

278
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,390
Because you are my friend,

279
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,420
we'll stay just one night.

280
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,863
Let's go back home then.

281
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,169
You go ahead without me.

282
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,768
l'll go see Gwiza.

283
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,878
Ngabo,

284
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,523
this cow,

285
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,527
l give it to you.
Pick it up tomorrow.

286
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,689
l give you that cow of mine.

287
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,063
Pick it up tomorrow.

288
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,767
Sit here.

289
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,306
Eat, my son.

290
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,867
But you said
there wasn't any food.

291
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,847
There is no food,
but there is for you.

292
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,124
Eat, my son.

293
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,886
lt's good.

294
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,330
- My son.
- Yes, Mom?

295
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,164
Do you live with that boy
who came with you?

296
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,968
Mom, Ngabo is my friend.

297
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,706
Your friend?

298
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,989
Mom, l'll save
some of this for him.

299
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,994
What?

300
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,895
Eat and finish it.

301
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:05,095
My hands won't work
for you and him.

302
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:09,833
l can't find food
for you and him.

303
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,762
l know this place.

304
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,508
Stand and don't make me tired,
or l'll leave you.

305
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,390
Good afternoon.

306
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,260
We were thirsty.

307
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,266
However--

308
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,671
Sangwa.

309
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,470
Did you see Ngabo?

310
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,034
He is so drunk.

311
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,741
He thought our beer
wasn't strong,

312
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:28,216
but now he's drunk.

313
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,754
Have you seen him?

314
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,223
But even me,
l'm feeling drunk.

315
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,021
Sangwa.

316
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,084
Yes, Gwiza, l can see that.

317
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,629
lt was serious stuff.

318
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,098
ls Ngabo in bed?

319
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,201
Sangwa.

320
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,103
Yes, Dad?

321
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,665
That boy you are with,

322
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,075
don't you know he's a Tutsi?

323
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,013
Don't you know
Tutsis are nasty?

324
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:04,913
They have put our people
in submission now.

325
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,551
Now l'm suffering
because of them.

326
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:16,090
They tried to put me in prison
even though l'm old.

327
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:20,069
And yet you walk with them?

328
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:25,769
Hutus and Tutsis are enemies.
Don't you know?

329
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,736
Dad,

330
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:33,512
let me think about it.
l can't respond to you now.

331
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,075
Okay go.
l'll be waiting.

332
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,553
But be quick.

333
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,117
l want to know
your thoughts soon.

334
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,594
You hear me?

335
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,443
This porridge is good.

336
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:10,647
- Yes, it's good.
- You put in the right amount of sugar.

337
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,053
lt will help me work.

338
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,285
Good morning.

339
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,199
Sit. l'll give you
some porridge.

340
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,085
Take it.

341
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,889
When l woke up,

342
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,659
l saw that the outer wall
is falling apart.

343
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,260
lt will affect the entire house.

344
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,732
What can be done?

345
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:06,766
You'll have to repair it.

346
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,042
This porridge tastes good.

347
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,986
This will warm me
for the cold day.

348
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,015
lt will warm your stomach.

349
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,714
Hey, Sangwa.

350
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:58,186
l'll do the opposite of you.

351
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,087
Why are you angry?

352
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,286
You're just goofing around.

353
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,390
You're lazy, just like when
we worked in Kimisagara Market.

354
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,672
You're angry

355
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,372
for no reason.

356
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:02,949
Do you think this is nothing?

357
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,354
Did my dad build this
so it could be destroyed?

358
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,892
Did he build it for nothing?

359
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,895
Might as well be nothing.

360
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,362
Did he build it properly?

361
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,234
Why else are we working on it?

362
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,719
Ngabo,

363
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,849
l want to talk about this journey.

364
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:55,203
We don't have to kill that man.

365
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,771
We don't have to kill him?

366
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,645
Sure, and while we're at it,
let's make him porridge.

367
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,512
What do you think?

368
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,814
lf you don't think
he should die...

369
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,913
Mom, there's no water?

370
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,833
Your mom isn't here.

371
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,044
Did you finish the wall?

372
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,735
Hey, Sangwa.

373
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,138
Forgive me.

374
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,272
Forgive you?

375
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,644
For what?

376
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,816
Don't worry about it.

377
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,089
That man

378
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,925
killed my father.

379
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,693
l have to kill him.

380
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,132
This is a duty.

381
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:15,399
Don't worry,

382
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,101
you don't have to do it.

383
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,939
Just be there with me.

384
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:37,125
Ngabo, how about
l buy land here for you to live?

385
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:45,832
That's funny, just like
Gwiza promising me a cow.

386
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:57,139
But seriously,
l wouldn't live here.

387
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,894
Dad, did l do something wrong?

388
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,230
lt's good my son.

389
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,701
l really appreciate it.

390
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,433
When l saw you looking at it,
l thought l did it wrong.

391
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,499
l want us to finish it,

392
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,510
close it here,

393
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,944
and fix this part.

394
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:35,508
How many days
will it take you to finish?

395
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,110
l have to start again
from here like this.

396
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,213
And we'll finish it well here.

397
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,315
lt's not difficult.

398
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,451
l'll start again soon.

399
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,655
- Son?
- Yes, Dad?

400
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,063
Where is that Tutsi-- Ngabo?

401
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,728
Ngabo? He is with Gwiza.

402
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,862
l'm happy now,

403
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,372
happy with my son.

404
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,464
l'm happy too.

405
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,841
With all of us together at home,
your mother is happy too.

406
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,345
l propose that tomorrow

407
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:07,645
we will celebrate
at the festival.

408
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,275
Thank you, Dad.

409
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,084
l'm happy for that.

410
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,716
You've been a good boy.

411
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:19,057
Let's go inside and talk.

412
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,461
Sounds good.
Let's go.

413
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,868
What makes me angry

414
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,001
is that l don't remember
my dad's face.

415
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,310
You don't remember his face?

416
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,449
l remember.

417
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,951
l remember that

418
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,921
after my dad was killed,

419
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,084
my mom burned
all of his photos.

420
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,856
She burned all of them?

421
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,660
Why?

422
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,495
l don't know.

423
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:01,025
After a short time,
she died too.

424
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,672
l also remember that

425
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,879
my parents died
when l was young.

426
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,685
And now,

427
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,453
when l remember
what had happened,

428
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,495
it saddens me a lot.

429
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,296
Sometimes l say that

430
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:35,134
if l could have parents,
l'd be like other kids.

431
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,333
What makes me even sadder

432
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,275
in my whole life

433
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,677
is when l remember
how my father was killed.

434
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:48,514
But we don't have to remember.

435
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,918
When l remember,
it depresses me.

436
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,028
So,

437
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,328
where were you today?

438
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,031
l was just around, visiting.

439
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,834
Let me tell you
something funny.

440
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,171
When l was bringing
back the cows,

441
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,701
someone called me
to share sorghum beer.

442
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,840
l wanted a lot,
but he only gave me a little sip.

443
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,113
He was selfish.
He didn't want you to finish.

444
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:26,451
l have another funny story.

445
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:27,990
When l was herding the cows,

446
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,958
l was feeling strong

447
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:34,053
so l tried to jump over a pit
and fell in.

448
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,896
And then a sheep jumped
onto my shoulders.

449
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,902
That's bad.

450
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:41,959
l laughed.

451
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,302
lt thought you would carry it.

452
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,639
l don't know.

453
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,735
l have a story too.

454
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,507
When l went to draw water--

455
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,448
do you know that woman
from Nyiramababi,

456
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,779
the one called Nyiraneza?

457
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,117
l better sell my cows,
sell my cows for your wedding.

458
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,181
When l was at the well...

459
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,853
She said, ''Sangwa, come here.''

460
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,192
When l approached her,

461
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,530
when l looked in her eyes,
she was quiet.

462
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,364
l asked her what she wanted.

463
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,234
She said, ''Tickle me.''

464
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,570
l fell down laughing.

465
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,735
l asked her how it was done.

466
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,541
l felt her touching my neck.

467
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,241
What is this?

468
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,250
l got away and ran.

469
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,344
Then l came back home.

470
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,981
So l wanted to ask you,

471
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,082
how do you tickle a woman?

472
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,923
She thinks city people
are like that.

473
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,724
No no.

474
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:46,167
l told her we can meet
after l ask you, Dad.

475
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:50,297
Son, wait until
the coffee beans are ripe.

476
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,534
l'll find bricks.

477
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:56,705
As things get ripe,
l'll lay tiles too.

478
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,748
Son, l will build a house for you.

479
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,840
You will be a man, and wise.

480
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,511
And l'll get my advice from you.

481
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,747
That's good, my son.

482
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,053
That's good, my son.
Keep asking for advice from us.

483
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,048
- l went to see Gwiza.
- How is he?

484
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,748
Not well, but the doctor said

485
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:52,853
he can improve,
perhaps after a few days.

486
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,760
Can he eat porridge?

487
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,128
No, nothing.

488
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:01,899
Can we go together to see Gwiza?
He's my friend.

489
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:14,279
Can we go together to see Gwiza?
He's my friend.

490
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,588
Listen, Ngabo...

491
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,187
come here.

492
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,258
You want to see Gwiza?

493
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:33,529
See Gwiza?

494
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:36,766
Ever since you came,
there's only trouble,

495
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,898
trouble everywhere.
Even my kids are sick.

496
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:43,071
Because of you,
everything is going badly.

497
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,646
Can we go to see him?

498
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,084
Yes we can.

499
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,254
Sangwa.

500
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,121
Yes, Dad?

501
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,660
You brought this
to my home.

502
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,286
Look what
you brought home.

503
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,992
Why else is this happening?

504
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,161
You have no shame?

505
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,536
You have no shame?

506
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,875
Mom, can we go with you?

507
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,709
For Gwiza?

508
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,716
No, you don't need to go.

509
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:25,276
The festival is still happening.
Go there instead.

510
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,017
We'll go alone, don't worry.

511
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,760
Sangwa-

512
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:29,805
What's up, Ngabo?

513
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:33,501
What your dad said upset me.

514
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,711
What do you mean?

515
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,741
l didn't appreciate
what he said to me.

516
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:47,480
l want to tell you
l'm not going to go with you.

517
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,081
What?

518
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,559
l'm staying here.

519
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,889
Well,

520
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:00,902
you're my only friend.
Who will l live with in Kigali?

521
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,806
You don't know that life is hard.

522
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:10,505
You have a family,
a mother, and a father.

523
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,310
You know why my life is like this?

524
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:16,249
Why my life is hard?

525
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,344
lt's because of your relatives.

526
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,322
Because Hutus killed my family.

527
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,087
My life would have been better
without them.

528
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,562
Even more,

529
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,160
l bet your father
was involved in the killings.

530
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,964
What? My father?

531
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,163
Your father.

532
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,333
Don't involve my dad in that.

533
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,672
The way he looks at me
when l enter your home

534
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,043
shows me that he
was among them.

535
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,451
My dad didn't do anything.

536
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:55,955
You know what?
l don't want to see you anymore.

537
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,550
Fine, l'm getting my bag,
l'm leaving.

538
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,369
l know everything.

539
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:53,507
Dad, l'm sorry--

540
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,926
Ngabo told me.

541
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,763
He told me your plans to kill.

542
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,200
Ngabo told me everything.

543
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,172
l know everything now.

544
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,673
Ngabo told me.

545
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,505
He told me

546
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,704
about your plans to kill.

547
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,872
Your mother
behind you like that--

548
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:03,851
your mother is behind you.
Maybe she is happy about this.

549
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,213
Leave, go.

550
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,207
Leave this place.
l don't want you.

551
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:33,339
Don't worry,
l'm going and won't come back.

552
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:46,250
l'm going and won't come back.

553
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,287
l told you your father
is a bad man.

554
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:24,526
Leave me alone.

555
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,866
Take your shirt.

556
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,300
Why are you following me?

557
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:13,314
l'm coming with you.
You're still my friend.

558
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:17,947
Leave me alone.

559
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:23,083
You refused me once.
l don't want you anymore.

560
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,481
Listen,

561
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,580
l don't want you with me.
You understand?

562
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:02,522
lt seemed like many days

563
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:06,083
l saw these parts of the country
as though for the first time.

564
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:11,123
l had not walked so far
since my mother and l were fleeing,

565
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:15,694
before we found
the refugee camp.

566
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,578
Back then we saw

567
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,012
a lot of death

568
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:30,541
and many horrors.

569
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:38,390
We saw rivers clogged
with bodies,

570
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,396
children killing.

571
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:48,528
There were babies sucking
at their mother's dead breasts.

572
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:58,779
And the blood covered the earth.

573
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:10,422
Sometimes those days
were all l could remember.

574
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,086
l remembered
my mother carrying me

575
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:18,122
Through the marshes
below our home.

576
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:28,970
There were voices all around,
crying and screaming.

577
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,420
My mother burned
the photo of my father

578
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:50,625
and l don't know why.
l forgot his face.

579
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:57,127
After my mom died,
sometimes l forgot her face too.

580
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:03,073
l imagined many times
the way l would strike him,

581
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:07,548
the man who killed my father.

582
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:21,591
l came to my family's land.

583
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:29,727
l felt that it was still ours,

584
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:34,299
because my father's blood
poured out onto it.

585
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,943
Does this place serve food?

586
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,312
Yes, food.

587
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,386
Was that a machete?

588
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,996
Do you know
that tomorrow is

589
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:47,508
National Liberation Day?

590
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:52,947
l'm supposed to recite a poem
at the official ceremony.

591
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:57,645
Would you like to be the first
to hear it?

592
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,524
My poem is called:

593
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,928
''Liberation is a Journey.''

594
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,932
Listen

595
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:16,301
Liberation is a journey

596
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:20,102
Rwandese of Rwanda
and Rwandese outside of Rwanda

597
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,938
All who speak
Kinyarwanda

598
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:26,003
We descend
from a common culture

599
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:30,416
Come, we'll sit here
in Rwanda

600
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:34,216
lmmersed by
the culture of Rwanda

601
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:39,353
Let's remember
how liberation came

602
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,591
Unleashing heavy
burdens in my youth

603
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:46,893
When l was young
and just a child

604
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:50,496
l played in mud
and heard of hate

605
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,173
Rwanda readied
children for war

606
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:59,145
Children chosen and armed
against enemies

607
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:05,318
l heard that Tutsis were roaches
and should be stomped

608
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:08,982
With tails like snakes,
they should be killed

609
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:12,618
We were given bows
and spears

610
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:16,221
And foreign countries
gave us guns

611
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,528
Really

612
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:23,934
Darkness came to Rwanda,
machetes in place of peace

613
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,201
l saw people killed

614
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,640
Muslims and Christians
worked together

615
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,645
Joined by machetes
and their will to kill

616
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,778
And our Rwanda burned

617
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:40,481
Rivers flowed with bodies
and corpses covered fields

618
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:45,925
Rwanda's youth led the battle,
don't you know that this is injustice?

619
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:51,762
That our Rwanda,
its beautiful rivers and pools

620
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,325
lts beautiful fields
with roads and no famine

621
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:59,563
Became a cemetery
and a shame

622
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,701
Don't you know
that this is injustice?

623
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,941
And the RPF Army
l was taught to hate

624
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:10,951
Decided that it was time
to defend Rwanda

625
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,078
Should Rwandese die?

626
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,385
Should there be widows?

627
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,358
Should the dead
be shamed?

628
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,827
They said, ''No''

629
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:24,889
War began in Kinigi,
in the heat

630
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:28,561
Everyone was involved,
so understand, my children,

631
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,970
lt wasn't about guns
or weapons

632
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,804
lt was about
a fight for truth

633
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,835
l will thank them
wherever l am

634
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:42,543
Their heroics will
be known worldwide

635
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,552
From Darfur in Sudan

636
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:50,114
To the Comoro lslands,
they will be admired

637
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:56,563
And l'll see them the way
the Pope sees his church

638
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,896
But now that they have conquered,
l ask of them

639
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:05,702
Free us from poverty and illiteracy
since liberation is a journey

640
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:08,766
l'll start with the family,
the foundation

641
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,836
l condemn the many men

642
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:15,644
Who don't allow their wives
to have a voice

643
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:19,016
They hit them
and think they're mindless

644
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,612
Who gains from this?

645
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,716
Man of mustache
and small mind,

646
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:28,194
Hairy chested
and without pity

647
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:31,699
You burden your wife
to stay in the house

648
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:37,637
You are killing our vision
of being a strong nation

649
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,903
And the children l see,
working so hard everywhere

650
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:44,912
Picking tea and coffee,
but they can't even afford soap

651
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,949
What a shameful image
of Rwanda

652
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:53,613
Give the child what he needs
and he can become a king

653
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:56,384
His parents will live in peace
and his family will be safe

654
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:01,953
Young girls miss school
and are given a broom

655
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,624
And they dig in the valley

656
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:09,864
Because education
is only for their brothers

657
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:15,400
A wife works all day
and her husband hits her

658
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,843
And who will save her?

659
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,108
Where will liberation be?

660
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:23,982
And men work hard,
sweat pours down

661
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:28,614
But he makes no money
and it's never enough

662
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,818
Don't you see
that this is injustice?

663
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:38,492
Let liberation come,
and let liberation be a journey

664
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,536
Away from prostitution

665
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:46,006
And toward wisdom
and to new projects done with fervor

666
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:49,703
The rich one can prepare a gift

667
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,405
To give to the poorest one

668
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,174
And how poor is he?

669
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,810
A house of wheat and bed of wheat
and he eats just wheat

670
01:20:57,886 --> 01:20:59,979
And then he's thrown
out like wheat

671
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,489
Really

672
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:06,618
Our beautiful Rwanda
with beautiful rivers

673
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:11,792
Beautiful pools and fields
with roads and no famine

674
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:12,834
Tell me

675
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:16,894
Will it remain a cemetery
without peace?

676
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,304
Don't you see
that this is injustice?

677
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:26,978
Let me speak further

678
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:30,609
What happens
in the village genocide courts?

679
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,313
Let justice liberate

680
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,846
Let truth replace lies
in Rwanda

681
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:42,694
Sitting together on the grass
without division or hate

682
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,824
Without lying to each other

683
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:50,031
As we live in peace
and the guilty seek forgiveness

684
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:55,372
Our future is already failing

685
01:21:55,443 --> 01:22:00,642
Unless we begin our journey well,
helping widows and orphans

686
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:07,416
And food for the man in ruins
with nothing

687
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:13,189
What is left is to share everything

688
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,753
As we battle against hate

689
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:20,130
l wish you all the best

690
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:23,364
And so l close here

691
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:26,896
l, a poet, will speak again

692
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:32,003
Peace to you in Rwanda,
peace everywhere.

693
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,203
What happened to you?

694
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,672
lt is AlDS.

695
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,548
Give me--

696
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,981
l need water.

697
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,227
Water.

698
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:48,030
Father, is that really your face?

699
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,404
You're beginning to remember.

700
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:59,647
Do you know why
l gave you the name

701
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:02,274
Munyurangabo?

702
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,852
Long ago,

703
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,186
in old Rwandan culture,

704
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:13,585
Munyurangabo

705
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:18,064
was a mighty warrior.

706
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:21,260
He would fight

707
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,600
ahead of others.

708
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,539
He would conquer

709
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:29,338
and clear the path.

710
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:32,779
And that is why

711
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:36,112
l gave you the name
Munyurangabo.

712
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:42,713
What is your battle?

713
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:59,401
That night l dreamt that
l was with Sangwa in Kimisagara.
