RADIO ANNOUNCER: It's going
to be a hot one today, folks.

195
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,678
It's gonna top out 97
in the civic center.

196
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,680
Smoke level's are still high.

197
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,583
In other metro news,
the bloody teen pack

198
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:37,684
That inspired the
tale of Dracula

199
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,187
Has been the victim
of bad press.

200

week since the disappearance

204
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,163
Of [inaudible].

205
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,134
Police are still holding one
suspect, a 17-year-old youth.

206
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,136
The name of the suspect is
being withheld by the police

207
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,638
Because he's a minor.

208
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,640
Also, in today's
news, filmmakers

209
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,143

WILL SPANNER (VOICEOVER): It's
been three years since I was

212
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,102
Last forced to use my powers.

213
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,405
It's a lot like
being on the wagon.

214
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,307
People will try to tempt
you into doing anything

215
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,644
When they know you've
got the [inaudible].

216
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,547
Anyway, things are good now.

217
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,749
And I've given up looking
for the perfect life.

218
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,222
Just doesn't come naturally
when you're a warlock.

223
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,673
Come have a seat.

224
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,147
I'd offer you some coffee, but
my secretary quit last week,

225
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,618
And, uh... what'd you
say your name was?

226
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:19,819
Lily Wild.

227
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,620
Hi.

228
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,094
My brother's in big trouble.

229
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,562
He's been arrested, and
they're accusing him of murder.

230
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,563
What's his name?

231
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,764
What'd he do?

232
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,333
It's been on the news and
it's been in the papers.

233
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,835
His name's Peter Wild.

234
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,837
He's only 17 years old.

235
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,341
He went out with a girl and she
disappeared, about a week ago.

236
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,310
And the police
think he killed her.

237
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,313
Well, don't you have
a public defender?

238
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,314
He didn't care.

239
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,816
About my brother, I mean.

240
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,286
The secretary at city hall
highly recommended you.

241
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,288
I gave up public
defending years ago.

242
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,290
I really need your help.

243
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,292
I have nowhere else to turn.

244
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,793
I'm... I'm sorry.

245
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,928
I can't do it.

246
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,297
I... you know, I have a
private practice now,

247
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,266
And I just handle
insurance cases.

248
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,768
Please.

249
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,270
Please.

250
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,772
Look, I can... I can refer
you to some other people

251
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:16,843
Far better qualified than
I to do this for you.

252
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,679
I don't have that much
money, Mr. Spanner.

253
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,514
I work in a bookstore.

254
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,317
I hardly make the rent
or the car payments.

255
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,952
I don't even have a car
now, because they're

256
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,820
Holding it as evidence.

257
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,921
I need your help.

258
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,896
All right, listen.

259
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,131
I've heard of the case.

260
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,899
I'll... I'll look into it
first thing in the morning.

261
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,936
OK.

262
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,374
Who's the officer in
charge of the case?

263
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,908
Lieutenant Hovis.

264
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,643
Well, it doesn't look good.

265
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,145
We traced the call
from the phone booth

266
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,280
To this old lady
who said she got

267
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,947
A call from someone named Nora.

268
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:59,052
When our guys got there, all
they found was Pete Wild.

269
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,054
It still doesn't sound like
you've got anything on the kid.

270
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,989
LT. HOVIS: Well, he busted up
the phone booth pretty good,

271
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,657
Not to mention he was
the only person out there

272
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,393
In the middle of nowhere.

273
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,261
Look, we found her
blood type on the phone,

274
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,897
He had a bruise on his head, so
obviously there was a struggle

275
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,366
And she hit him and boom, boom.

276
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,768
I mean, he's our guy.

277
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,104
So where's the body?

278
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,971
Ah, he must have gotten
scared and dumped it off

279
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:19,772
In the desert.

280
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,973
We're still looking for it.

281
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,310
Listen, the kid's
prints were all around.

282
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,312
WILL SPANNER: Oh,
that's ridiculous.

283
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,679
Why would he kill
her and then dump

284
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,548
The body somewhere and then
go back to scene of the crime?

285
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,349
He was hysterical.

286
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,883
Who knows?

287
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,821
The girl's purse was
found in his possession.

288
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:35,622
So what?

289
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,357
He's her boyfriend.

290
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:41,027
I mean, the deposition
that the old lady took

291
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,029
Stated that she was
hard of hearing, right?

292
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,132
Isn't it possible
that she could have

293
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,599
Misunderstood what Nora said?

294
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,435
LT. HOVIS: Hey, she heard
well enough to get the girl's

295
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:52,004
Name right, and the location.

296
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:55,275
You don't have a case.

297
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,909
Until you come up with
the body, all this is

298
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,411
Purely circumstantial evidence.

299
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,181
Look, I'm gonna tell you
this, just so that you know.

300
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,349
I don't want you
to think that this

301
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,617
Is some kind of boy-girl
teeny-bopper argument

302
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,918
We got here.

303
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,787
We're linking this guy
Pete to a whole shitload

304
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,222
Of serial killings.

305
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,657
WILL SPANNER: What
serial killings?

306
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,958
Come on.

307
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,526
We've been finding bodies
out in the desert for years.

308
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,563
I think we got six in all.

309
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,431
Really gruesome stuff.

310
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,732
Oh, come on.

311
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,601
You can't possibly expect
me or anyone else to believe

312
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,402
That a 17-year-old boy...

313
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,704
Yes I can, and I do!

314
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,839
I mean, was it
coincidence that she

315
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,176
Disappeared in the same area?

316
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,678
No.

317
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,281
Right now Pete Wild
is our best suspect.

318
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,185
And let me tell you
something... he is a weird kid.

319
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,587
He keeps taking his
sister's car, right?

320
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,521
Without asking her.

321
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,955
So I ask him where he goes.

322
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,227
He says he doesn't know.

323
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,129
And I don't think I have
to tell you that, uh...

324
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,398
There are certain
aspects of this

325
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,033
Investigation that cannot...
And I mean cannot...

326
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,203
Be leaked to the press.

327
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,171
If by chance this
Wild boy is innocent

328
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:02,309
And this killer's signature
gets out... I'll bet you 10 to 1

329
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,611
We have a whole string
of copycat killings.

330
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,679
Oh, this is the biggest
bunch of horseshit

331
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,481
I've ever heard in my life.

332
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,017
And I'm not gonna let you
guys get away with this.

333
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,753
Tell you what, if you try
to take this thing to court,

334
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,488
I am gonna nail your
ass to the wall.

335
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:20,727
Goodbye.

336
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,202
Those are nice chairs.

337
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,703
My mother had the same kind.

338
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,205
She's a witch.

339
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,187
Now, Lily, I've talked to Pete.

340
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,689
He's pretty reluctant
to say anything.

341
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,658
How is he?

342
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,160
I mean, OK, considering
he's in jail.

343
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,662
Can you help him?

344
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,729
Yeah, I think so.

345
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,665
I mean, I don't think
they have a case.

346
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,167
Well, when will he get out?

347
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,902
Well, they say
they want to hold

348
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,137
Him for his own protection.

349
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,139
The public's crazy
to get at him.

350
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,641
Someone's leaked
it to the press.

351
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:09,809
Oh, god.

352
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,644
How can they link my
brother to serial killing

353
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,613
When he hasn't ever
done anything wrong?

354
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,616
My guess is that
he's all they've got.

355
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,117
Anyway, as long
as they hold him,

356
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,119
The real killer would be
stupid to strike again.

357
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,121
So, as far as the
state is concerned,

358
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,090
This problem's
temporarily solved.

359
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,792
It buys them some time.

360
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:26,593
Great.

361
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,595
Meanwhile Pete's stuck.

362
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,597
We have to help him.

363
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,099
I will help him, Lily.

364
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,067
It's just not gonna be easy.

365
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,570
Hovis won't tell me
anything I need to know.

366
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,072
The DA won't release the files.

367
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,574
I'm gonna have to find
the killer myself.

368
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:50,049
Anyway, I just wish I
knew where to start.

369
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,052
I don't understand why he'd
bring his date out here.

370
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,033
So this is the
phone booth, huh?

371
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,106
Look.

372
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,074
What?

373
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,578
I found it over there.

374
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,580
Do you think it's a clue?

375
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,914
Oh, I doubt it.

376
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,050
The police would have found
it already, don't you think?

377
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,051
Maybe not.

378
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:28,054
But it's something.

379
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,523
Well, look at that.

380
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,525
LILY: What do you
think it means?

381
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,526
I don't know.

382
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,495
But I've heard of
the Coven before.

383
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,496
You have?

384
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:37,497
Yeah.

385
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,499
It's a club downtown.

386
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:14,367
[Music playing]

387
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,811
You need a jacket.

388
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:25,812
What?

389
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,980
You need a jacket.

390
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,781
OK.

391
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,516
MAN: I saw her, boss.

392
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,017
MAN: Fuck, what
are you, retarded?

393
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,019
You didn't see
nothing, all right?

394
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,488
MAN: I... I saw her.

395
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,189
The girl with the
long, black hair.

396
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:43,990
MAN: [inaudible].

397
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,464
She was gone before
you came back.

398
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,966
Got it?

399
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,001
MAN: Are you sure?

400
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:55,802
MAN: Fuck.

401
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:57,203
Yes!

402
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,138
What do I know?

403
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,206
Nothing.

404
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:03,209
You don't know a fucking
thing, all right?

405
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,245
Hey, want something?

406
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:07,246
Me?

407
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,214
Yeah.

408
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,749
You... you need a
drink or something?

409
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,217
No, thanks.

410
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,220
What's the matter, [inaudible]?

411
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,189
He's here to check out
the naked ladies, boss.

412
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,190
Yeah, that's right.

413
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,692
The naked ladies.

414
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,360
MAN: Oh, the naked ladies.
I see.

415
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,194
Yeah.

416
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,362
Who's going on tonight?

417
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,163
Yeah.

418
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,666
Boss, who's on tonight?

419
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:27,967
Maybe you are.

420
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,503
I'm gonna put a wig on you
and shave your ass and legs,

421
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,638
And then you can
do a strip tease.

422
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:33,640
How's that, buddy-boy?

423
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,474
That'd be good.

424
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:40,747
Hey, listen, do you guys
know what BD stands for?

425
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:41,681
BD.

426
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:42,749
That's big dicks, boss...

427
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,585
Shut the fuck up.

428
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,553
I don't know what that is.

429
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,987
You know what that is?

430
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,596
Ladies and gentlemen...
Well, gentlemen, that is.

431
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,766
Hey, I'd say it's a good
time for some disco.

432
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,334
That doesn't really
work here, I guess.

433
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,904
Tonight we have a
special show for you.

434
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:09,175
We're gonna present to
you the lovely Belladonna.

[Scattered applause]

436
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,912
What is she doing up?

437
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,315
Boss, what time is it?

438
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,050
Do I look like Big Ben?

439
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,218
Am I Swiss?

440
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,086
Am I ticking?

442
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,089
It's time for you
to shut the fuck up,

443
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,090
That's what time it is.

444
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,607
She sure is
something, ain't she?

445
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:25,611
Oh, I sure wish I
could do like that.

446
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:29,682
You know, she's
like a real star.

447
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,183
A star?

448
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,186
[Inaudible].

449
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,356
Anyway, you want a drink?

450
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,157
No.

451
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,158
No, I'm good.

452
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,326
You gotta have something.

453
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,161
There's a [inaudible].

454
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,129
What?

455
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,630
Oh, yeah, yeah.

456
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:47,133
Uh... vodka's fine.

457
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:48,801
Straight up?

458
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:49,601
Yeah.

459
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:50,803
Yeah, that's fine.

00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:51,603

Hi.

464
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,483
Can I help you?

465
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,784
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

466
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,554
I was... do you know
where the bathroom is?

467
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:51,257
Please come in.

468
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,058
Sit down.

469
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,104
That looks dangerous.

00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,976
We all acquire a few
bad habits along the way.

471

Do you have any bad habits?

Listen, uh... I really need
to ask you a few questions.

473
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,290
Are you the police?

00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,692
No, I'm a lawyer.

475
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,794
Oh, a lawyer.

476
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:30,296
Wow.

477
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:33,866
Let me tell you what I think.

478
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:37,970
I think that lawyers are the
lowest scum of the earth.

479
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,772
At least, that's
what I've heard.

480
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:43,475
Well, I'm sure there
are worse professions.

481
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,576
Sure.

482
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,580
You could be a bouncer.

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,817
Is he bothering you, BD?

- Bye.
- No, no.

No, wait a minute.

Do you know Nora Breckenridge?

girl who's disappeared.

Don't worry.

00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,865
I used to disappear a
lot, too, when I was 16.

00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:24,050
OK, I'm down!

491
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,255
Don't get me mad.

00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,425

What a dick.

Oh, the buzzer's broken.

495
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:48,174
Come.

496
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,642
I'm gonna be late for work.

497
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,579
Just relax.

498
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,016
Well, I appreciate
all your help.

499
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,017
It's no problem.

500
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,318
It's not out of the way.

501
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,753
I'm really worried about Pete.

502
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,656
I don't know how much
longer he can hang on.

503
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,126
We have to do something fast.

504
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,961
Well, I found out
some information.

505
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,762
I found out what BD means.

506
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,031
It's a woman.

507
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,467
The matchbook?

508
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,936
Is it gonna help the case?

509
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,438
I don't know.

510
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,173
Anyway, I'll tell
you what happened.

511
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,143
BD stands for a stripper
named Belladonna.

512
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,510
Really?

513
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,311
Yeah.

514
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,112
Anyway...

515
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:40,912
Was she pretty?

516
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:41,713
Who?

517
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,815
The stripper, stupid!

518
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,251
Oh, yeah.

519
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:48,854
Well... yeah, she was all right.

520
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,456
Anyway, listen.

521
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,024
So anyway, so I'm waiting for
her outside, and she comes out,

522
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,993
And she's kind of
sneaking around.

523
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,180
She gets on this
motorcycle and takes off.

524
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,214
And I followed her for a while.

525
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,716
And then I lost her.

526
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,651
What's so strange about that?

527
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,388
She's sneaking around
her own apartment!

528
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:23,155
Come on.

529
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,190
We've gotta go.

530
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,627
So what are we gonna do now?

531
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:39,471
Well, I'd kind of like
to get some pictures

532
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,539
Outside the Coven.

533
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,175
I'd like to get people
going in and out,

534
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:46,212
And I'd like to go see
what Belladonna's up to,

535
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,447
See if I can catch her
sneaking around again.

536
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,416
Well, if you want,
I'll take the pictures.

537
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,685
Well, I... I don't
think... are you sure you'd

538
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:54,720
Wanna do something like that?

539
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,487
Sure.

540
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,322
Whatever you want.

541
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,636
Hello, hello.

542
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,837
OK.

543
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,607
We'd like to bring a
lovely young lady out here.

544
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,109
And she's gonna
sing a song for you.

545
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:56,081
The great, the one
and only, Belladonna!

That's Belladonna at
the 2 O'clock club.

550
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:16,335
What does that have
to do with the Coven?

551
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:19,004
Why would she have to hide
from that stubby, wannabe

552
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,473
[Inaudible] thug
just to come here?

553
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,415
[Music playing]

554
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:47,733
(SINGING) Oh, oh, oh, oh well.

555
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:51,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

556
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:04,049
Sugar, let me entice you
with my sweet perfume.

557
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:04,850
Uh-huh.

558
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,858
Couldn't keep my eyes
off you [inaudible]

559
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:18,864
As you walked through
the room, yeah.

560
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,316
Can you hear me crying?

561
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,320
Can you feel me dying?

562
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,990
Can you hear my crying?

563
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:45,791
[Inaudible]

564
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,770
Can't walk away, no, no.

565
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,276
You can't walk away.

566
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,750
[Applause]

567
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:31,136
Hey.

568
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,103
Hey, hey.

569
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:32,904
Hey.

570
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,509
So you found me.

571
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,446
You have an incredible voice.

572
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,947
Thank you.

573
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,114
Can we talk?

574
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,115
Come on.

575
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,088
Not this again.

576
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:54,593
Listen, why do you... why
do you work as a stripper

577
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,094
If you've got a voice like that?

578
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,096
Don't you have a manager?

579
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,065
Yeah, I have a manager.

580
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,567
Sounds like you need a new one.

581
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:12,043
Hey, listen, I found these in a
phone booth out in the desert.

582
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,548
Regular, honey?

583
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,521
My number gets left in
lots of phone booths.

584
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,022
So what?

585
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:28,093
What is it that you
really want from me?

586
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,763
I'm working on a case
involving a 17-year-old boy who

587
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,031
Is in jail for a
murder he did commit,

588
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,468
And this is my only lead.

589
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:40,371
I'm really sorry about that,
but there's nothing I can do.

590
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:42,474
I think you're
involved in something.

591
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,442
I mean, why else would
you be sneaking out

592
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,044
Of your own apartment in
the middle of the night

593
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:49,080
To come sing in a blues club?

594
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,917
Whatever it is,
it's my problem, OK?

595
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,919
Come on.

596
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:57,388
Look... what's your name again?

597
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,490
Will.

598
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,860
Look, Will, you can
think whatever you want.

599
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,362
I'm not sticking
around this place.

600
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,832
If you can stop being a
detective for just one night,

601
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:10,301
Maybe you can come to my place.

602
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,304
Obviously you know
where I live already.

603
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:18,777
We can talk there,
and... see what happens.

604
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,717
Yeah, OK.

605
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,219
Let me get changed,
and I'll be right back.

606
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,571
Why don't you take
your jacket off?

607
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,025
Do you want to hear some music?

608
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,872
[Music playing]

609
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,626
Look... look, what I really need
tonight is some information.

610
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,462
At least you could tell me why
your name's on the matchbook.

611
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,799
Please, anything would help.

612
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,234
Because I'm at a dead end.

613
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:50,401
Don't worry about it.

614
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,471
Don't... don't worry about it?

615
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,974
Will, it's late.

616
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,977
Can't you think
about it tomorrow?

617
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,478
Come sit here.

618
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,447
Please?

619
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,951
I won't bite.

620
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,452
Come sit down.

621
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:28,406
Just for one night, Will, please
give in It doesn't matter.

622
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:29,908
It doesn't matter.

623
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:43,889
[Knocking]

624
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,425
Oh my god.

625
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,027
Get in the closet.

626
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,161
Get in the closet, quick.
Why?

627
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:51,329
Who is it?
Don't come out.

628
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,764
Please don't come out.
He'll kill us.

629
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:53,765
Don't say a word. [Inaudible].

630
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:19,725
How are you?

631
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,226
Do you need anything?

632
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,193
No.

633
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:22,994
No?

634
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:24,696
You don't need anything?

635
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,698
Good.

636
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,300
I hope all is well.

637
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,135
Yes.

638
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:33,004
Yes what?

639
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,005
Yes.

640
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,006
Everything is fine.

641
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,980
In the club?

642
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,882
The dancing?

643
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:45,250
You're happy with that?

644
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,151
Yes.

645
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,185
Why?

646
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,353
I wouldn't want you
to become unhappy.

647
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:54,092
You're not feeling
like singing again?

648
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,028
I would never do anything
you said I shouldn't do.

649
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,464
MAN: Really?

650
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:03,869
So you didn't do anything
like that tonight?

651
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,536
I don't know what you mean.

652
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:06,805
Oh, I wasn't clear?

653
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,775
I think I was fucking clear!

654
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,776
You must communicate.

655
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:17,182
You know those talks we had
about your career moves?

656
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:20,151
Those little tete-a-tetes?

657
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,652
I'm serious.

658
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:23,154
I know that you were.

659
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,492
How about men?

660
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:29,828
Have you seen any lately?

661
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:30,628
No.

662
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,030
MAN: No men?

663
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,031
Not ever?

664
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:33,865
None?

665
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,266
None walking down the street?

666
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,201
Seems odd.

667
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:37,235
There are plenty of men around.

668
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,603
I see them all the time.

669
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:39,537
I thought you meant...

670
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:40,738
What the fuck do
you think I meant?

671
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,241
Don't fuck around!

672
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,176
[Inaudible], I didn't!

673
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,316
You're hurting me.

674
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,119
Shut up!

675
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,621
You screw all the time,
and you lie to me.

676
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,588
[Inaudible]

677
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,589
Shut the fuck up!

678
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:04,562
Turn over.

679
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,564
I said fucking turn over!

680
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,270

681
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,220
[Scream]

682
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,111
Don't continue with these lies.

683
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,081
I gave you everything, and I can
take it all back in a minute.

684
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,531
Oh, shit.

685
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,801
Damn it.

686
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,735
Don't baby me.

687
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:25,670
I'm not a child.

688
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:47,325
Who was that?

689
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,928
That was my manager.

690
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:51,729
Right.

691
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:52,730
Your manager.

692
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:03,008
What kind of... what
the fuck are you doing?

693
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,575
Why don't you have him arrested?

694
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,644
Does this kind of shit
go on all the time?

695
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:10,015
I didn't see you
trying to help!

696
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,084
You probably liked
watching, didn't you?

697
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:15,320
You probably want
to fuck me too.

698
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,654
OK, tough guy.

699
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:17,922
Now's your chance.

700
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:19,124
Come on, do it!

701
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,330
Just forget it.

702
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,133
There's nothing
you can do, anyway.

703
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:30,101
What's that supposed to mean?

704
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,569
Look, I wanna help you.

705
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:35,840
But somebody has got to tell me
what the fuck is going on here.

706
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,276
There's nothing I can do.

707
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,878
He gave me everything.

708
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,148
My voice... I don't know!

709
00:49:43,248 --> 00:49:44,115
Please just go.

710
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,019
But...

711
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:48,986
Get out!

712
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:49,820
Leave me alone!

713
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:08,933
I'm telling you,
I followed her four

714
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:13,104
Fucking times to this fucking
joint in the past three weeks.

715
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,672
So this is where
she's been hanging

716
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:16,441
Out, the lying little tart.

717
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,308
Yeah.

718
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,743
And that fucking
lawyer schmuck's

719
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,511
Been snooping around too.

720
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,513
You want I should whack him?

721
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,482
No.

722
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,884
He's being taken care of.

723
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,587
Well Jesus fucking Christ,
let me clip him, man.

724
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,357
I hate that fucking
tall-ass Texan

725
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,992
Drawl-talking
corn-eating fucking

726
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,462
Nelson-looking cow-humping
motherfucker, man!

Hal, Hal, Hal, Hal, Hal, Hal.

728
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,933
Such language from a man who's
so obviously well-educated.

729
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:47,004
Yeah, well, what
the fuck should I do?

730
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,006
Take care of BD.

731
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,809
She's the one that's
stepping out of line.

732
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:52,643
Fine.

733
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,044
Hey, man, I gotta clip somebody.

734
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:57,515
I'm getting out of
fucking practice, here.

735
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:02,920
If I ever needed a son, you're
obviously the man for the job.

736
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,389
Hal, you're heaven-sent.

737
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,698
WILL SPANNER
(VOICEOVER): No matter

738
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:16,367
What I do to get
away, eventually

739
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,336
The dreams come back.

740
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:20,805
But is it a dream?

741
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,273
Or have they found me again?

742
00:52:28,246 --> 00:52:30,581
Jack comes out of the
barn with a watermelon.

743
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:34,852
A watermelon!

744
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:35,653
I mean...

745
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:45,095
Well, last night
was something else.

746
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,064
I'm surprised I didn't
get myself killed.

747
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,957
[Inaudible].

748
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:47,792
Well, great.

749
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,460
When'll they be ready?

750
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,928
You're lucky.

751
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,397
They're done.

752
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:55,366
I hope they're OK, or at
least what you wanted.

753
00:53:58,903 --> 00:53:59,970
Remind you of somebody?

754
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:00,771
What?

755
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:08,245
So what did you
find out last night?

756
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:12,383
Well, a lot, and
nothing, really.

757
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:13,851
I followed her to
a club, this place

758
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,354
Called the 2 O'Clock club.

759
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,357
It's a blues club.

760
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:24,829
And, uh... she gets up on the
stage and starts singing.

761
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,797
She's the singer there.

762
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:29,567
Anyway, so I look
around... guess who I

763
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,303
See shaking hands with people?

764
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,270
Who?

765
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:36,273
WILL SPANNER: Lieutenant Hovis.

766
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,777
Now, I don't think he saw me,
but I tried to follow him,

767
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:40,745
And he took off.

768
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:41,779
That's weird.

769
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,748
What do you think
he was doing there?

770
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,750
I don't know.

771
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,752
That does seem to fit together.

772
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,320
Do you think he
knows what we know?

773
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,721
I don't know.

774
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,023
Did you try and talk to him?

775
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,425
No.

776
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:57,094
But I think he's involved with
those people, whoever they are.

777
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:58,228
Great.

778
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,130
So the guy that's trying
to pin it on my brother

779
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,599
Is involved in the whole thing.

780
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,668
Well, we don't know that yet.

781
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,870
But whoever these people
are, they're very dangerous.

782
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,110
What would I have
done without you, Will?

783
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,078
Don't worry about it.

784
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:16,547
I've enjoyed spending
time with you.

785
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,983
I like spending
time with you, too.

786
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:33,764
Lily, do you... uh... are
you... do... are you involved

787
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:36,667
With anybody right now?

788
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,135
Not really.

789
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:41,071
He left me for someone else.

790
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,039
Oh, I'm sorry.

791
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:44,509
I... well.

792
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:46,977
Probably too good
for him, anyway.

793
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,414
It was a long time ago.

794
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:51,382
I have to think
about Pete, anyway.

795
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:52,349
Oh, yeah.

796
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,318
What, uh... tell me something.

797
00:55:54,419 --> 00:55:56,554
What... what happened
to your parents?

798
00:55:56,654 --> 00:56:01,392
Why... why did you end up
raising him by himself?

799
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:02,493
My parents were murdered.

800
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,991
Thanks for dinner.

801
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:34,992
You're welcome.

802
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,001
What?

803
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,436
What is it?

804
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:46,236
Am I being a jerk?

805
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,006
I... I'd rather go inside.

806
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,509
OK.

807
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:52,677
Alone.

808
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:53,478
OK!

809
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:54,845
I understand that.

810
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:55,646
Goodnight.

811
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,882
Thanks.

812
00:56:57,982 --> 00:56:58,883
[Inaudible].

813
00:56:58,983 --> 00:56:59,884
Your purse.

814
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:03,387
Lily!

815
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:04,555
[Knocking]

816
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:05,355
Lily!

817
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,480
All right, Hovis, I wanna
know what the fuck is going on!

818
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:11,749
Why won't the PD talk to me?

819
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,483
Hey, it's my day off.

820
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:14,719
Let me tell you
something, mister.

821
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:16,854
You just can't come over
here and intrude on my life

822
00:59:16,954 --> 00:59:18,455
Every time you got a question.

823
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,356
You cut the shit, Hovis.

824
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:20,324
I want to help him.

825
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:21,792
I'm his lawyer, for
crying out loud!

826
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,928
Yeah, well, I don't think
that's the way Pete sees it.

827
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,129
Oh.

828
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,197
Well, how do you think
Pete feels about it, then?

829
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,099
Listen, if you want
to talk about this,

830
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,101
Why don't you come over
to my office tomorrow?

831
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,770
Don't jerk me around, Hovis.

832
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,106
I want to know now!

833
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:38,508
All right.

834
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,310
It seems that you've
been, uh... hanging

835
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,578
Around with that girl a lot.

836
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,413
His sister.

837
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,482
Looks like you're paying more
attention to her than to Pete.

838
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:50,454
How did you hear that?

839
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,723
Hey, I got ears.

840
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,825
You're involved in
something, Hovis.

841
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,494
What's going on, man?

842
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,930
You're into something,
and it stinks.

843
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,733
Is somebody paying you
to pin all this on Pete?

844
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,835
Did you happen to see
a picture of the girl?

845
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,270
Huh?

846
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:08,005
His date?

847
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,840
Unbelievable.

848
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,276
I had to get the parents to
come down to identify her.

849
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:16,080
And as far as they're concerned,
her father would just as soon

850
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,682
Put a gun down his throat.

851
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:20,050
Yeah, but did he do it?

852
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,585
I mean, you're gonna
say that he went

853
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:23,888
Around and did all these
killings for the past year?

854
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,790
17 years old!

855
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,591
Yeah, and 12-year-old
kids kill each other

856
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:29,159
Over a pair of sneakers.

857
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,661
Now get off my porch.

858
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,202
Look, I'm not gonna let
you get away with this.

859
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,337
I'm gonna find a way
around this, and when I do,

860
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:41,605
You're fucked.

861
01:00:41,706 --> 01:00:44,308
You know what I'm saying?

862
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:45,710
OK.

863
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,878
But you better watch
what you're doing.

864
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,280
Because if things go
sour, I'm not gonna

865
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,481
Be around to help you out.

866
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,316
It's your responsibility.

867
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:53,117
You understand?

868
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:59,456
Look, this thing goes
beyond the law, Will.

869
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:00,825
You just don't see it.

870
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:03,193
Now, if I were you, I
would just back off.

871
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,494
We got it under control.

872
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,295
OK?

Oh, hello, Belladonna.

No, no, no.

01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,498
Is everything OK?

878
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:44,969
Are you all right?

879
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,937
I'm just a little
surprised you called.

880
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:53,110
Yeah, yeah.

881
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,511
Sure, yeah.

882
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:56,446
Can I come down to the... your
house, or the Coven, or what?

883
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,381
What do you want me to do?

884
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,351
Yeah, OK.

885

[Music playing]

886
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:45,896
Thanks for meeting me here.

887
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:52,469
I know this is a
funky old elevator,

888
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:56,941
But it's the only
place I could think of.

889
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,643
Can I have one of my cigarettes?

890
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:00,444
Yeah.

891
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:03,914
Thanks.

892
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:10,354
Can I have one, too?

893
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,856
Sure.

894
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:12,857
Thank you.

895
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:18,829
So why don't you tell me
about this manager of yours?

896
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,168
OK.

897
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,102
What's his name?

898
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,909
His name is Rob Santara.

899
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:32,977
Oh yeah.

900
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:36,180
Isn't he that
controversial disc jockey?

a contract with him?

01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:57,134
He's a disc jockey.

910

He likes the music.

911
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:02,039
He says it reaches the
right kind of people.

01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:03,007
So, what?

913
01:04:03,107 --> 01:04:04,975
He likes to play
records for a hobby?

914
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:09,046
I guess you could say that.

915
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:15,352
Listen, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

916
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:16,786
Can we just forget about it?
What?

917
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:17,587
What?

918
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,389
This is crazy.

919
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,758
Will, if you know
what's good for you,

920
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,727
You'll stay away from us.

921
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,662
Don't ever come near me again!

922
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:40,144
What's the matter with you?

923
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:41,611
First you call me, you
tell me to come down,

924
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,248
Then you tell me to go away,
and then you call me again!

925
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:47,051
Do you want me to
help you or not?

926
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:48,518
[Door closing]

927
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,628
Well, where did he
work before that?

928
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,601
That's weird.

929
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,103
It must be an alias.

930
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,575
Well, you got an address on him?

931
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:16,146
OK.

932
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,247
All right.
Thanks.

933
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:18,048
Bye.

934
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:29,893
Uh, yeah.

935
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:32,362
In Burbank, I need a number for
a radio station called KSTN.

936
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,771
[Phone ringing]

937
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,474
KSTN.

938
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:45,475
Hi, yeah.

939
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:49,313
I need an address
on Robert Santara.

940
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:50,814
Look, how the
hell am I supposed

941
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,782
To know where he lives?

942
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,751
I mean, he's great and all.

943
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,220
He gets his stuff in on time.

944
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,188
But I just don't have
an address on him.

945
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,358
It just doesn't
work that way, OK?

946
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,527
What time does he
come in at night?

947
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,461
He doesn't.

948
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:07,064
He broadcasts from
somewhere else.

949
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:08,265
You don't even
know where your disc

950
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:09,833
Jockey is broadcasting from?

951
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:12,336
Look, it's just not
important to us, OK?

952
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,304
We're just happy to
get those ratings.

953
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,307
It's like, we're a
small college station,

954
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,809
And we're getting, like,
incredible recommendations,

955
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:20,810
You know what I mean?

956
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,812
I mean, it's fucking
hot right now.

957
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,314
People fucking love him.

958
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:25,482
You know?

959
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:26,783
OK?
You got it?

960
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:27,784
That's it.

961
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:28,585
I'm done.

962
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:29,986
I'm late for my art class.

963
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:30,787
Goodbye.

964
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,613
(SINGING) Well, where's
that little sister?

965
01:06:56,713 --> 01:07:00,284
Where's that little thing?

966
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,886
Where's that little sister?

967
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:06,790
She's down in the middle
doing that mojo swing.

968
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:11,495
Little sister, where's
that little thing?

969
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:13,963
Where's that little sister?

970
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:20,370
She's down in the middle, doing
that mojo swing, mojo swing.

971
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:27,344
Excuse me.

972
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:28,778
Excuse me.

973
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,180
How you going?

974
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,615
All right.

975
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:32,982
Belladonna gonna
perform tonight?

976
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:34,618
I hope so, man, yeah.

977
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:35,552
I play in a band.

978
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:36,353
I'm on.

979
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:37,921
You know ND?

980
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:38,755
Yeah.

981
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:41,291
How often does she perform here?

982
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,659
You some kind of cop?

983
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:43,693
What's with all the questions?

984
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,594
No, no, no.

985
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:45,962
I'm just a friend.

986
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,364
A friend, huh?

987
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:49,233
Yeah, you know, she comes in,
she sings, she does her thing.

988
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,300
You know.

989
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,669
I haven't seen her
around lately, though.

990
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,071
Could be trouble.

991
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:55,872
Trouble?

992
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:57,174
What do you mean, trouble?

993
01:07:57,274 --> 01:08:00,644
Ain't my business,
ain't your business.

994
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:01,945
What are you talking about?

995
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:03,880
What'd you say your name was?

996
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,681
I'm Spanner.

997
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:05,849
William Spanner.

998
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:06,650
Yeah.

999
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,718
I'm her lawyer.

1000
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:09,519
Says who?

1001
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,627
You know her manager?

1002
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:19,028
Yeah.

1003
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:20,364
You really a lawyer?

1004
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:21,865
Yeah, I'm her lawyer.

1005
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:24,734
Yeah, I... yeah, I
know the manager, yeah.

1006
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:25,535
Santaro.

1007
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:27,070
Seen them together.

1008
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,105
I'd stay away from him
if I was you, though.

1009
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,640
He's definitely trouble.

1010
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,575
Especially him, man.

1011
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:32,942
That's like playing with fire.

1012
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:33,877
What, what?

1013
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:34,978
What's the matter with him?
Why?

1014
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:36,546
You ever heard of the
Legend of the Blues?

1015
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,548
No, I don't know the
Legend of the Blues.

1016
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:39,549
What's...

1017
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:40,717
I didn't think so, man.

1018
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:44,721
Listen, man, this guy
Santaro, he's like, uh...

1019
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,923
He's, like, around
her all the time, man.

1020
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:49,092
He's like... most of the time
he's, like, across the hall

1021
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:50,260
From her.

1022
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,628
I don't know, don't
quote me on it, you know?

1023
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:52,929
I'm not really sure.

1024
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:54,398
But he's definitely dangerous.

1025
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:00,770
WILL SPANNER: Listen, man.

1026
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:05,809
You know a lot more than
what you're telling me.

1027
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:10,113
Listen, you got the power, man.

1028
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:12,616
I don't want to have
anything to do with this.

1029
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:14,718
I told you too much already.

1030
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,853
Do what you do.

1031
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:20,123
I don't wanna have
nothing to do with this.

1032
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:22,492
At all.

1033
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:23,993
OK.

1034
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:24,961
Appreciate it.

1035
01:09:25,061 --> 01:09:25,962
You have a good show.

1036
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:58,194
Hello?

1037
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:03,267
Didn't you see the closed sign?

1038
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,901
I must have forgotten
to lock the door again.

1039
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,069
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1040
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:09,439
Come back tomorrow.

1041
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,407
No, no.

1042
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,442
I really can't do that.

1043
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,144
Say, you look really familiar.

1044
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,246
Do I know you from somewhere?

1045
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:18,047
No, I don't think so.

1046
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,584
Yeah, well, listen, I've
got to have some information.

1047
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,687
I need everything you've got
on the Legend of the Blues,

1048
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:24,888
Anything like that.

1049
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:27,557
Well, now, yes, that's
something I know about.

1050
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,459
It's in the book.

1051
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:34,030
Probably this one... right here.

1052
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:41,338
OK.

1053
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,009
Here it is.

1054
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,110
OK.

1055
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,079
It's based on a quote
by Lyndell Johnson.

1056
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,148
He said... and I ask him how.

1057
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,285
He said, if you want to
learn anything and make songs

1058
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,487
For yourself, you
take your guitar

1059
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,022
And you go to where
the road crosses

1060
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:00,557
That way at the crossroads.

1061
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:05,061
Be sure to get there a little
before 12 o'clock that night.

1062
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:07,397
You have your guitar, and
you be playing a piece,

1063
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:09,299
Sitting there by yourself.

1064
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,668
A big black man
will walk up, take

1065
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:15,071
The guitar, tune, then
he'll play a piece

1066
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:16,473
And hand it back to you.

1067
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:18,207
And that's the way
the devil learned

1068
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:21,578
Me to play anything I want.

1069
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,612
Can I see that?

1070
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:23,413
Oh, sure.

1071
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:29,719
See?

1072
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,355
It's got pictures of all
those guys in the early part

1073
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,923
Of the century.

1074
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:34,724
There they are.

1075
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:41,631
What are you looking at?

1076
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:42,666
Oh, yeah.

1077
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,902
That's that manager
from the '20s.

1078
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:47,270
Who was he?

1079
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:50,006
He was this guy that come to
the south... nobody knows when...

1080
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,642
And signed up a
lot of men and put

1081
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,344
Them on their first recordings.

1082
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:56,680
He was pretty famous
for that back then,

1083
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,481
From what I understand.

1084
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:03,219
What's the matter with you?

1085
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,990
Oh, uh... how much do I owe you?

1086
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:08,091
$50, plus tax.

1087
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,892
$50?

1088
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:29,345
Hey, I've got some
change for you!

1089
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,815
WILL SPANNER (VOICEOVER):
The Legend of the Blues, huh?

1090
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,283
What did that have
to do with Santara?

1091
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:38,722
I could have sworn the
guy in the book was him.

1092
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:42,692
If that's true, then he's
been around a long time.

1093
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,695
How many people
does he [inaudible]?

1094
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:47,697
How many souls has he robbed?

1095
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:04,648
The question is, am I after
him, or is he after me?

1096
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:10,386
Hello?

1097
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:11,621
Somebody out there?

1098
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,757
Can I help you?

1099
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:15,725
[Inaudible].

1100
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:19,162
I haven't seen you for a while.

1101
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:21,130
MAN: Hello.

1102
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,567
I still represent you, don't I?

1103
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,034
Yeah, I guess you do.

1104
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,035
Yeah.

1105
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:27,971
That's the trouble with talent.

1106
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,939
Whenever they get
any recognition

1107
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:32,408
They think they can
get a better manager.

1108
01:13:32,509 --> 01:13:33,577
No gratitude.

1109
01:13:33,677 --> 01:13:35,278
They just think
about themselves!

1110
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:36,646
Listen, man, I
thought you were busy

1111
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,816
Doing all this other stuff,
with all that new music stuff,

1112
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:40,617
You know?

1113
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,452
Hey, music's music.

1114
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,487
I'm a solid guy.

1115
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:46,289
I'm loyal.

1116
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:48,758
What are you doing here?

1117
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:52,195
I wanted to ask you what you
said to that lawyer fellow.

1118
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:53,129
- What lawyer?
- Oh, come on.

1119
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:54,163
Don't lie.

1120
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,099
You know what lawyer
I'm talking about.

1121
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,501
The witch-fucker.

1122
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,269
Santara, please, man, I don't
know what you're talking about.

1123
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,505
Why do they lie?

1124
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,907
I mean, I just wanted to
know what you talked about.

1125
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,842
I didn't talk to
anybody about anything.

1126
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:06,843
I'm telling you.

1127
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,077
I think you did.

1128
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,346
What did you tell him?

1129
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,815
All right, listen.

1130
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:15,384
Honest, Santara,
please, this guy came,

1131
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,420
Said he was some lawyer guy,
some schnook guy, I don't know.

1132
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:20,223
And I said... he said
something, and that was it.

1133
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:21,658
He came and he went,
and that was it.

1134
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,860
What's the matter?

1135
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,862
Why are you scared?

1136
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,264
I'm not gonna do
anything to you.

1137
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,667
What do you think I'm gonna do?

1138
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:31,835
I don't know, man.

1139
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:33,570
Maybe you might kill
me or something.

1140
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,839
How long have we been together?

1141
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:38,775
10 years, isn't it?

1142
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,545
Remember the first
recording session we did?

1143
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:45,414
The sound engineer got his
finger shut in the car door.

1144
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,350
That was so amusing.

1145
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,718
Good times, eh?

1146
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:52,822
Kill you?

1147
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:53,823
I'm not gonna kill you.

1148
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:54,924
I have very few clients left.

1149
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:57,460
I need you, OK?

1150
01:14:57,561 --> 01:14:59,195
Just don't talk to that
lawyer guy anymore.

1151
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,300
Good.

1152
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,101
Enjoy the show.

1153
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:10,406
Enjoy the show?

1154
01:15:14,377 --> 01:15:15,244
Agh...

1155
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,045
[Inaudible].

1156
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:19,816
Fucking hold him, man!

1157
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:20,817
I'm trying!

1158
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:28,257
[Inaudible].

1159
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:47,644
He's fucking dead.

1160
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:48,444
Come on.

1161
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,316
[Inaudible] leave the body...

1162
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:54,818
No, take him home and
meet your fucking mother.

1163
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:55,619
Let's go.

1164
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:56,419
Come on.

1165
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,736
Doesn't anybody knock anymore?

1166
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:15,004
I told you never to come back!

1167
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:16,973
Yeah, and I told you
I couldn't help you out

1168
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,407
Unless you told me the truth.

1169
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,876
Get out!

1170
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:22,746
What, are you gonna
sick fido on me again?

1171
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:24,013
It's not gonna happen this time.

1172
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,382
I'm not leaving here until
you tell me who Santara is

1173
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:28,952
And who... and what... you are.

1174
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,219
Oh, no.

1175
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,990
Not two of them, sniffing
on 'em like a fucking dog!

1176
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:49,939
Come one!

1177
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,440
Open the fucking trunk!

1178
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,909
It won't open.

1179
01:16:53,009 --> 01:16:54,410
Fuck!

1180
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:59,382
Open the fucking... get him in.

1181
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,860
Drive the fucking car!

1182
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:53,669
Hold still!

1183
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:00,143
Come on!

1184
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:01,644
Stick him!

1185
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:04,647
[Inaudible] bad
habit, counselor.

1186
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:07,650
WILL SPANNER: No,
no... no, no, no, no!

1187
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:08,451
[Laughter]

1188
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,387
Sweet dreams.

1189
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:12,756
[Inaudible].

1190
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:13,923
What are you, a
fucking junkie now?

1191
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,159
Shut the fuck up.

1192
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:19,695
Well... what do we
do with the body?

1193
01:18:19,796 --> 01:18:23,399
I'm gonna bash his fucking
skull in 'til his eyes pop out.

1194
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:24,267
VOICE: No you don't.

1195
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,935
What do you think you're doing?

1196
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:26,903
Don't kill him.

1197
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:28,371
You leave him for me.

1198
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,832
You know who I am?

1199
01:18:55,932 --> 01:18:58,534
You denied [inaudible]
yourself for too many years.

1200
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:00,003
You've forgotten who you are.

1201
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:02,405
Come with me.

1202
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:03,372
No!

1203
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,841
VOICE: I'm your brother, Will.

1204
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,243
We were born as twins
to the same mother,

1205
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:08,711
Just before the Inquisition.

1206
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,313
Go fuck yourself!

1207
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,715
VOICE: You haven't
changed one bit, have you?

1208
01:19:12,816 --> 01:19:14,183
[Inaudible]

1209
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:16,719
You don't want to suffer the
inconvenience of death again,

1210
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,520
Do you?

1211
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,888
Yes, I do!

1212
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:22,758

you've learned is forgotten.

[Inaudible]

1214
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:27,763
You can't imagine what
it feels like there.

1215
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:29,265
This is paradise, Will.

1216
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:32,735
There's only one perfect
way of immortality.

1217
01:19:32,836 --> 01:19:36,705
And we're the only two
left who can achieve this.

1218
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:38,207
No!

1220
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:40,209
Tonight.

1221
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:41,710
My place.

1222
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,680
I'm having your [inaudible].

1223
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,681

SANTARA: This is Rob Santara,
here on KSTM college radio,

1226
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:03,859
Playing the tunes just for you.

1227
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,961
Thanks for joining.

1228
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:06,862
We'll be rocking and
rolling all night long.

1229
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:10,333
I love all my followers,
and I won't stay here long.

1230
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:11,834
So turn up your stereos!

1231
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,753
[Silence]

1232
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:50,173
Will!

1233
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:56,112
Uh-uh.

1234
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:56,912
Why resist?

1235
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,385
This is who you are.

1236
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:08,857
I'll take your saliva.

1237
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,926
We are the same.

1238
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:12,996
From the same.

1239
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:16,265
We are not men, human.

1240
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:18,067
You know that.

1241
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,435
You are part of me.

1242
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,307
Make him look at me!

1243
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:27,443
Look at me!

1244
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:31,380
I have more power.

1245
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,351
You've been biting your
tongue for too long.

1246
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,854
You are weak.

1247
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:44,327
If time is eternal, what
chance does she have to live,

1248
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:48,397
Say, 65 years in eternity?

1249
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,333
Take her life.

1250
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:51,367
Do it.

1251
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,869
Take her heart.

1252
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,872
Just reach in and do it.

1253
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,375
That's right.

1254
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,877
That's right.

1255
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,380
To be, or not to be.

1256
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,882
That is the question.

1257
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,053
Whether tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows

1258
01:23:10,153 --> 01:23:13,322
Of outrageous
fortune, or to take

1259
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:18,694
Arms against a sea of troubles,
and, by opposing, end them.

1260
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:23,566
To die, to sleep.

1261
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,035
Death is pure.

1262
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:28,637
Life is abstract and muddled.

1263
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,640
Filthy, dirty.

1264
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,577
We exist beyond that.

1265
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:37,513
Take her life.

1266
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:40,249
Take her heart.

1267
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:43,119
Just reach in and take it.

1268
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:46,822
If you love her, she will
be part of you forever.

1269
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:56,565
Go on.

1270
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:57,366
Kill her.

1271
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,443
You don't need those, Will.

1272
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,813
Remember the way.

1273
01:24:10,913 --> 01:24:15,751
It's your life, handed down
from your mother and father.

1274
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,553
Do it.

1275
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,988
You're the last there is.

1276
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:22,158
There is no one else.

1277
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:46,048
Stop!

1278
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,849
[Inaudible]

1279
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,522
You bastard!

1280
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,711
Are you OK?

1281
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:24,179
LILY: Yeah.

1282
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,180
I think I'm all right.

1283
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,257
WILL SPANNER: I'm gonna
go check on Belladonna.

1284
01:26:34,357 --> 01:26:35,057
OK?

1285
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:42,731
You killed him, you bastard!

1286
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:43,532
Ugh...

1287
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:07,556
I'm so sorry.

1288
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:08,957
I wanted to tell you!

1289
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:15,564
She was like me.

1290
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:18,534
He had her soul!

1291
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:21,937
She tried to talk her
brother into it, too.

1292
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:23,872
Why?

1293
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:24,840
I don't know!

1294
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,377
Santara helped her.

1295
01:27:28,477 --> 01:27:30,746
Then why did she do it?

1296
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:33,215
I don't know.

1297
01:27:33,316 --> 01:27:35,217
I'm nothing.

1298
01:27:35,318 --> 01:27:37,686
You must think I'm dirt.

1299
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:39,688
[Sobbing]

1300
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:43,158
No.

1301
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,128
No, you did what you
had to do to survive.

1302
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:47,630
It's OK.

1303
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,631
It's OK.

1304
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,916
Well, well, well.

1305
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:08,817
Officer Hovis.

1306
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,621
What's it gonna be?

1307
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,590
It's your move.

1308
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:18,494
My move, huh?

1309
01:28:18,594 --> 01:28:19,595
What's going on, man?

1310
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:20,696
What are you doing here?

1311
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,965
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

1312
01:28:23,065 --> 01:28:24,299
I've come to congratulate you.

1313
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,102
You solved all my problems.

1314
01:28:27,202 --> 01:28:28,270
Really?

1315
01:28:28,371 --> 01:28:30,272
I solved... I think you're
part of the problem.

1316
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:31,874
Well, you can think
whatever you want.

1317
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:35,243
But right now I got half the
LAPD outside, not to mention

1318
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:38,213
A few key members of the press.

1319
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:42,618
And we just made the biggest
pinch of a serial killer

1320
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:48,757
That this city has
seen in... Christ,

1321
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:50,826
As long as I can remember.

1322
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:51,927
That's real tidy, then.

1323
01:28:52,027 --> 01:28:53,429
So I guess you're gonna
hang it all on Pete.

1324
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:56,064
Nah, we know he
didn't do nothing.

1325
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,332
We released him as
soon as we found

1326
01:28:57,433 --> 01:28:59,502
Out Santara was just after you.

1327
01:28:59,602 --> 01:29:00,603
Imagine that?

1328
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:02,137
Hey.

1329
01:29:02,237 --> 01:29:04,072
Just listen to me
for a second, OK?

1330
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:10,913
Pete was talking a lot about his
sister when we picked him up.

1331
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:12,314
So I got to thinking,
well, maybe she

1332
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:14,683
Was involved in this somehow.

1333
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:18,153
As I dug a little deeper, sure
enough, she set the both of you

1334
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:18,954
Up.

1335
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,795
She was gunning for you, Will.

1336
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:28,531
So why didn't you just tell me?

1337
01:29:28,631 --> 01:29:30,198
Oh, yeah, right.

1338
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,668
With you and your bleeding
heart liberal sensibilities?

1339
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:34,069
You would have asked
her right away,

1340
01:29:34,169 --> 01:29:35,871
And the whole thing would have
gone down the fucking toilet.

1341
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:37,072
You got no foresight, Will.

1342
01:29:37,172 --> 01:29:39,374
He really doesn't.

1343
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:43,412
Ah, it doesn't matter anyway.

1344
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:44,913
[Whistle]

1345
01:29:46,515 --> 01:29:49,351
Some weird shit went
on here tonight, huh?

1346
01:29:49,452 --> 01:29:51,119
Yeah.

1347
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:56,659
So I guess, uh... we've got a
lot of explaining to do, huh?

1348
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:59,027
Does this mean that you're
gonna keep me for questioning?

1349
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:00,829
Nah, we won't.

1350
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:03,365
But I'd get out of here
and let us take the credit.

1351
01:30:03,466 --> 01:30:07,402
Might, uh... what's the
word I'm looking for here?

1352
01:30:07,503 --> 01:30:10,072
Confuse.

1353
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:11,774
Might confuse things
if you hang around.

1354
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:12,575
OK.

1355
01:30:12,675 --> 01:30:13,609
OK.

1356
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:14,943
We're gonna go out
the back door there.

1357
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:15,744
Good.

1358
01:30:18,814 --> 01:30:21,383
Let me ask you
something, though.

1359
01:30:21,484 --> 01:30:22,651
What actually
happened down there?

1360
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,587
I mean, I heard a
hell of a scream.

1361
01:30:24,687 --> 01:30:26,555
Oh.

1362
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:27,923
It was nothing.

1363
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:29,925
It was all a dream.

1364
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:32,094
A dream?

1365
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:32,928
Yeah.

1366
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:35,397
But it's... it's long gone now.

1367
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:42,871
Come on.

1368
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:44,372
Let's get out of here.

WILL SPANNER (VOICEOVER): Seems
like a never-ending cycle.

1371

I'm back to pretending
to be normal.

1372
01:31:19,508 --> 01:31:24,312
Pete's out of jail, but he'll be
going into a psychiatric ward.

1373
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:26,081
Couldn't take the news
that his sister was the one

1374
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:29,417
Who had his parents killed.

1375
01:31:29,518 --> 01:31:32,755
Seems she felt she'd
been abused, [inaudible]

1377
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:38,927
She'd worked for him ever since.

Belladonna has a
recording contract.
