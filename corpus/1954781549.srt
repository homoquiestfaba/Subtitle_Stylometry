1
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,200
Jacques, you are my guest today.

2
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,660
Yes.

3
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,070
You are a school teacher,
you like nature

4
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,500
you are a keen
talk-show viewer

5
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,030
and you collect Russian watches
from the 70's.

6
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,110
Yes, exactly.

7
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,830
You are 54 years old.

8
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,660
Yes, that is true.

9
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,110
- You are a widower.
- Yes.

10
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,860
Do you believe in god?

11
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,400
If you mean an old guy
with a beard

12
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,910
who lives
in the clouds... no.

13
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,410
Okay.

14
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,410
What are your goals in life?

15
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,520
To be happy.
That's the main thing.

16
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,110
Also I have a special project
that I'm quite keen on.

17
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,270
I would like to start
my own line of sports clothes.

18
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,850
Interesting.

19
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,100
Please tell us a little bit about
the dessert that you have chosen.

20
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,440
We are all very impatient
and very much listening.

21
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,390
Uh, yes, I have chosen
the strawberry Charlotte.

22
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,560
And tell us in a few words why you
have chosen the strawberry Charlotte.

23
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,690
Well, it is a very simple cake

24
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,270
and very easy to make. Um..

25
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,020
What the fuck?

26
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,470
And the ingredients
are very inexpensive

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,470
and they are not
so gross to touch

28
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,510
very well.

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,510
This is no good, cut.

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,100
Dennis, why do you keep
scratching yourself?

31
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,640
It's getting worse and worse!

32
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,220
What, what?

33
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,150
You've been scratching
yourself like a dog

34
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,050
for the last three days.
What's up?

35
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,890
Oh, it's nothing.

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,530
It's just a few rashes,
it will go away.

37
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,800
Rashes from what?

38
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,140
Uh, you know, I thinks it's
an eczema breakout or something

39
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,880
but it's actually kind of all
over, it's itching like hell.

40
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,530
But you can't see it
on camera, can you?

41
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,090
We can see it on camera,
it's gross.

42
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,470
How do you expect
to make people want to cook?

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,250
You look like a leper!

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,590
I don't know, it's actually
probably the costume I think.

45
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,090
You know, Suzy changed the detergent
from what she normally uses so

46
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,670
I guess I have sensitive skin and I've
had a little bit of allergic reaction.

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,510
So, I don't know, that's all.

48
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,460
I have asked her to go back to
the old stuff and she said no

49
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,140
there you go, I don't know, I don't like
to tell, but that's what has happened.

50
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,420
Alright, listen, we're gonna to finish
like this for the rest of the day.

51
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,080
We don't really have
a choice, so just..

52
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,210
And go see a specialist.
don't stay like this.

53
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,080
Yeah, yeah, I promise,
I will do it.

54
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,170
Okay, let's go.

55
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,830
Okay.

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,170
Put your head back on.

57
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,000
Got it. Yeah. I'm ready.

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,620
You know I was thinking
of something.

59
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,000
What if I grab your arms from
behind but really discreetly

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,950
as soon as I see you starting to
itch and then I can hold them

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
there and that'll help.

62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,750
Yeah, yeah, Jacques!

63
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,950
You know, thanks a lot but, uh, you
just focus on being a guest alright.

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,920
This is complicated enough
as it is.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,420
Okay, let's go again people
right away.

66
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,870
Denis, whenever you're ready.

67
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,620
Yeah, okay, I'm ready.
Alright, lets..

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,070
Okay.

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,410
So, the strawberry Charlotte..

70
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,370
What are those sticky things
in the tummy for, daddy?

71
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,110
Nothing at all.

72
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,240
That's why I'm takin'
it all out, honey.

73
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,900
I already told you about this.

74
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,740
It's the same
for all the animals.

75
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,440
The insides serve no purpose.

76
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,160
Yeah. Ah!

77
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,070
Reality! don't touch that,
it's disgusting.

78
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,940
Now go wash your hands
we're about to eat.

79
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,030
Okay.

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,480
You're a real pain!

81
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,200
I did not change detergents!

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,200
How many times
do I need to tell you?

83
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,270
You know I'm right,
don't think I'm an idiot.

84
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,030
It smells different. I noticed
the smell on the first day.

85
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,860
You're completely crazy,
you have a real problem!

86
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,520
Yeah, I have a problem, I'll show you.
I don't think you realize! Look. See?

87
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,400
Rashes all over my arms.
Rashes everywhere!

88
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,180
I mean, look! See! It itches so
much I can't sleep at night!

89
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,730
Look at what your shitty
detergent is doing to me!

90
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,350
Alright? I'm being eaten
all over! See?

91
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,110
But there's nothing at all.

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,350
What are you talking about?
There's nothing there!

93
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,560
Nothing there?

94
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,510
Look at this. You see?

95
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,430
I mean, all of my skin
is covered in bumps!

96
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,400
All that so you can save a couple
bucks on a pack of detergent.

97
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,100
And look at the result.

98
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,640
I can't even wear a t-shirt
anymore because of you!

99
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,640
Everything okay here?
What's the matter?

100
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,130
You know the matter is that
this bitch won't listen to me

101
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,630
and go back
to our old detergent!

102
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,670
This bitch?

103
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,340
Yeah, that's what I said,
yeah. Bitch!

104
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,970
Okay, listen to me, this
is going to be very simple.

105
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,300
From now on, you can wash your own
stupid costume, is that what you want?

106
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,590
Sure, yeah! Whatever, fine.

107
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,590
Well, good luck.

110
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,170
Okay fine,
I'll do my own laundry.

111
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
It's not a big deal.

112
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,960
Um, oh, yeah.

113
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,640
We got some letters for you.
Mainly complaints.

114
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,040
About what?

115
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,580
Well, about you scratching
yourself.

116
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,420
Apparently it doesn't look good
and the fans are not happy.

117
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,670
Okay, I get it.
I'll go and see a specialist.

118
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Hey!

119
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,290
I was real careful not to film
your hands earlier.

120
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,550
And after a while I had
the idea to zoom in

121
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,660
on your face as much as possible

122
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,250
and it really worked. We couldn't
see you scratching yourself

123
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,910
all we would see was your head.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,420
That's nice. But there
are three other cameras.

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,960
Forget it. It was a nice
thought anyway, but thanks.

126
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,840
Also, I wanted to ask.

127
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,700
You started off as an actor,
didn't you?

128
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,420
- Nope, not at all.
- No. Shit.

129
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,240
Wait. Why? What difference
does that make?

130
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,790
No, I was just thinking,
as I am about to make a movie..

131
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,170
I'm going to have loads of
little parts to fill so

132
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,860
as you came across great on
camera, close-ups, you know

133
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,150
I was thinking maybe
suggesting, but I guess not.

134
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
- Well, no.
- Okay. No problem.

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,360
There you go.

136
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,280
Yeah. See you
tomorrow then.

137
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,900
Why was there a videotape
in the hog?

138
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,860
What are you talkin'
about, darling?

139
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,160
Well, I saw a videotape come out earlier,
when daddy was emptying the insides.

140
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,330
Stop talking nonsense.

141
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,690
Come on, eat.

142
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,080
But it's true.
I saw it.

143
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,860
No.

144
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,520
Listen, there can't be videotapes
inside the tummy of animals, darling.

145
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,610
It simply is impossible.

146
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,520
Reality, my sweetie pie,
listen to me.

147
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,570
How could a hog
swallow a videotape?

148
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,850
It's much too big, it wouldn't
go down, it's just not possible!

149
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,020
Well maybe
that's what killed him.

150
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,900
He choked on the tape
and tried to swallow it

151
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,140
but it got stuck in his throat.

152
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,560
No, he died because
I shot him, honey.

153
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,390
And even if he did swallow the tape, it
would have been completely crushed up

154
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,090
by his chewing it, you see?

155
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,530
I mean, he wouldn't have
swallowed it in one piece.

156
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,780
Think about it!

157
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,740
Well, I don't know how
it's possible, but I saw it.

158
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,330
I'm not crazy!

159
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,860
I think you're just tired.

160
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,320
Come on, it's time
for you to go to bed.

161
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,860
Come with mommy.

162
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,450
Come on.

163
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,650
Think about it, honey.

164
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,400
After having dinner
with her parents

165
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,240
the little girl quietly
brushed her teeth

166
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
looking at herself in the mirror

167
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,940
thinking back on her day.

168
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,610
She put on her favorite pajamas

169
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,230
"got into her cozy, little bed

170
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,690
"convinced she had seen
that tape

171
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,870
"come out
of the tummy of the hog.

172
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,110
That night the little girl
had funny nightmares."

173
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,820
That's it.

174
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,560
- I like this book.
- I know.

175
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,190
It's time for you
to go to bed. It's late.

176
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,440
Goodnight.

177
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,640
I saw that tape.

178
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,970
 Tell Zog he's wasting film.
He shoots too much.

179
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,480
He'll push us over budget.

180
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,220
I'll tell him.

181
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,100
Mr. Marshall says that you
must reduce your consumption

182
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,140
of film or else
you'll go over budget.

183
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,890
You tell him that it is very
tricky to film children.

184
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,720
Reality is only 7, it's the first
time she's been in a movie.

185
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,650
I have to adapt to her rhythms.

186
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,140

He says filming kids is tricky.

187
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,680
That's no excuse.

188
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,180
Why keep on filming such a crappy shot?

189
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,760
The kid's just lying in bed!
Why film her?

190
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,880
He is asking why the camera is still
rolling for such a crappy shot?

191
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,630
I was simply waiting
for her to fall asleep.

192
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,430
I think she was struggling to
fall asleep because of the lights

193
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,170
and the presence of the crew,
and it's not a crappy shot

194
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,220
it is a crucial moment.

195
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,000
She gently falls asleep
and her nightmare begins.

196
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,540

He was waiting for her to fall asleep.

197
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,630
Why?

198
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,710
She doesn't have to sleep!
It's a movie.

199
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,140
She can fake it.
That's what movies are!

200
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,880
It costs money to keep rolling, dammit!

201
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,870
Mr. Marshall, your
appointment is here.

202
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,720
Yes.

203
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,370
I'll see him when we're done.
Have him wait in my office.

204
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,830
Very good, sir.

205
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,120
Give him a fruit.

206
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,960
Certainly.

207
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,540
There you go.
She falls asleep. For real.

208
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,830

She falls asleep for real.

209
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,200
About time!

210
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,240

I'm all yours.

211
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,410
- How are you doing?
- Perfect.

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,750
How long's it been?

213
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,450
Ten years?

214
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,250
That's right!

215
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,280
You've hardly changed physically,

216
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,030
I dyed my hair, that's all.

217
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,660
- So?
- Yes!

218
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,280
You've brought me something to read.

219
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,500
Well... No.

220
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,740
 I finally decided
to talk you through it because...

221
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,110
Reading makes it seem complicated.

222
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,700
Complicated?

223
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,690
What's it about, brain surgery?

224
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,150
No, no...

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Anything but!

226
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,990
Good. Here.

227
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,780
Have a cigar.

228
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,360
No, thanks.

229
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,940
Do, please.

230
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,490
It's not my thing.
I'm not feeling my best, either.

231
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,330
don't be a jerk.
These little ones are tasty.

232
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,980
Mexican.
They dry them for four years!

233
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,350
This beauty cost megabucks.

234
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,140
Really, I don't like cigars.

235
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,770
Have a cigarette at least.
I keep them, for non-smokers.

236
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,310
don't be shy!
I'll light it for you, see?

237
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,180
- Thanks.
- There you go.

238
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,850
Aren't we more relaxed?

239
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,310
True.

240
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,060
True.

241
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,720
 So, your movie.
Tell me, when is it set?

242
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,970
It's set... In the present day.
Right now.

243
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,560
Okay.
Do you have a title?

244
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,110
Meaning what?

245
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,060
Waves, like "microwaves."

246
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,470
Okay. "Waves."

247
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,770
Whatever.

248
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,390
Carry on. It's set in the present.

249
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,670
Yes, smack in the present.

250
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,630
Stop, sorry. Give me that.

251
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,170
You smoke so badly, it's annoying.

252
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,550
- I'm not used to...
- It's no fun unless you do it right.

253
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,210
How about we talk outside?

254
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,920
Some fresh air?

255
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,720
Yes, it's rather hot in here.

256
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,750
Precisely. This room is poorly aired.

257
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,170
I'll be on the deck,
doing business with a young director.

258
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,000
No calls, please.

259
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,090
Come on.

260
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,460
Funny, you were the receptionist before.

261
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,750
Yes.

262
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,470
Now you're bringing me a project.

263
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,000
Isn't life amazing?

264
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,630
Give me a second.

265
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,720
Hey Zog!

266
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,370
Less film!

267
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,010
- What'd he say?
- He said, less film.

268
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,580
Oh, tell him to go fuck himself.
I'll film as much as I want.

269
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,450

He says, he will try!

270
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,950
We need to know
what's on the tape!

271
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,790
- Who's he?
- An ex-documentary maker.

272
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,830
I picked him out of the gutter.

273
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,070
He's a handful, but talented.
His movie is stunning.

274
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,710
He lets the camera roll too long,
but he's good.

275
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,370
It's hard to relax, standing up.

276
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,660
don't you think?

277
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,320
I don't know.

278
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,110
This is better.

279
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,280
I'm dying to hear what you've got.

280
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,530
Sit down.

281
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,740
- I'm dying to tell you.
- Go ahead.

282
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,260
- It's set in the present day.
- Yes!

283
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,230
Wait a minute.
Do you smell stale tobacco?

284
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
Probably because I smoked.

285
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,320
- Isn't it unpleasant?
- It's kind of smelly.

286
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,310
Makes me want to puke!

287
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,560
Okay, I'll shut up and listen.
I’m ready to go.

288
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,150
Let's go!

289
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,100
Right. So...

290
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Like I said, it's set in the present,

291
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,310
contemporary, on earth.

292
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,820
Here's the idea.

293
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,180
We don't know why,
but TV sets suddenly get vicious.

294
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,060
Which TV sets?

295
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
All of them.

296
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,820
All?

297
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,280
All tvs, everywhere.

298
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,370
Every TV on earth?

299
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,990
Yes.

300
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay, go on.

301
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,400
So...

302
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,190

People don't realize it, but...

303
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,530
The TV sets beam waves at them

304
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,690
that suck out their intelligence
day after day.

305
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,740
They get completely stupid.

306
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,110
The dumber they get,
the more TV they watch,

307
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,650
and the dumber they get, and so on.

308
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Sci-Fi.

309
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,610
Right.

310
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,690
- That's it?
- No.

311
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,810
That's only part one.

312
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,020

After that,

313
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,560
when the waves have made
everyone on earth completely stupid,

314
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,320
the TV sets decide to wipe them out.

315
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,770
And this is where it gets exciting,

316
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,520
they start beaming waves that kill people.

317
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,360
Wow. The whole works.

318
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,900
Right. Everybody on earth dies.

319
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,730
There's nobody left. No survivors.

320
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,100
No hope.

321
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
"The end."

322
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,230
No hope? I like it.

323
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,520
Me too.
There's usually a ray of hope. Not here.

324
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600

That's my idea.

325
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,590
Go back to the tvs.
How do they kill people?

326
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,220
It's a bit unclear.

327
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,590
It's similar to part one.

328
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,770
They beam very strong waves

329
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,090
that burn people up inside.

330
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,010
How do they react?
What do we see on the screen?

331
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,810
They bleed, intensely, all over.

332
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,800
It's sickening. Blood spewing
from their eyes, arms, chests...

333
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,670
Nice! I love it.

334
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,430
- Are they in pain?
- They're in pain. Agony.

335
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,590
I'm impressed. I love it.

336
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,630
But like I said before,
how do we see the pain?

337
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,170
Hold it!
Tell me indoors, okay?

338
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,670
We'll have a cigar.

339
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,540
Come on.

340
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,670
- I love it.
- You do?

341
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,620
- Really?
- Really.

342
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,670

You're not just being polite?

343
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,870
No, I mean it.

344
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,830
Shit! It's filthy!

345
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,090
- Roughly, this is it.
- Just a sec.

346
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,450
Send Daniel with a stain remover.

347
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,090
Something strong.

348
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,660

So, show me. Tell me.

349
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,370
That's roughly it.

350
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,240
- You draw like shit.
- It's a diagram.

351
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,450
The TV beams the waves

352
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,330
towards the person.

353
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,610
He dies because of the waves.

354
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,820
And then... He bleeds his guts out.
See?

355
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
Okay, I get it.

356
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,030
But look,

357
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,780
these wavy lines show us the beams.

358
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,780
Yes, it's beaming.

359
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,900
We can't show it on film.

360
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,360
You can't film invisible waves.

361
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,650
How will people get it?

362
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,400
Easy. We'll hear a humming,
like a microwave.

363
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,560
We'll dub it in post.

364
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,350
[Knock on door]
Okay.

365
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,350
Yes?

366
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,190
You asked for me, sir?
For the rug?

367
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,430
It's too late, buddy. I've
already cleaned it myself.

368
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
Please, shut the door,
I have an appointment.

369
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,140

I love it.

370
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,820
No kidding?

371
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,730
I really do.
It fills my head with pictures.

372
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,100
Tvs, waves, people bleeding,

373
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,220
no hope, Sci-Fi... I love it.

374
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,310
You couldn't make me happier.
I've been working on this for years.

375
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,270
Can we go back to the pain?

376
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,550
 How do we see the pain
when they start spewing blood?

377
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,890
Tell me.

378
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,470
They groan, I think.
With pain.

379
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,900
How do they groan?

380
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,300
They groan, I think, with pain.

381
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,190
I'm not sure what you mean.

382
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,770
Do it for me.

383
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,420

What?

384
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,260
The groan.
Give me the feel of your film.

385
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,130
Well... I don't know...

386
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,050
Actually...

387
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,210
I haven't...

388
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,500
I don't know exactly...

389
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,460
What kind of groan it is.

390
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,640
To be honest, I didn't think about it.

391
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,130
It's a key detail.

392
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,670
I've been focusing on the plot, but...

393
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,750
You're right,
I should've thought about the groans.

394
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,670
Jason, I know you well enough

395
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,620
to give it to you straight.

396
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,680
I like your project.

397
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,750
I'm game to sign.

398
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,090
Okay. Wow!

399
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,170
I don't know what to say!

400
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,700

don't say, listen.

401
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,990
I'll sign, on one condition.

402
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,830
Find the groan.

403
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,700
It's key.

404
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,120
I want the best groan
in movie history.

405
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Okay.

406
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,210
don't say, “okay.” I'm serious.

407
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,200
I want an Oscar for that groan.

408
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,330
Right.

409
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,670
Fuck the rest.

410
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,330
Do your thing with it,
simplify it, I don't care.

411
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,660
- Wow!
- I'll give you 48 hours.

412
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,490
Get to work.
Call me when you're ready.

413
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,070
If I like the groan, we'll sign.

414
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,410
You'll make your movie.

415
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,240
Is it a deal?

416
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes.

417
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes?

418
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,310
Are you to old person
that lives in house?

419
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,780
Yes.

420
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,070
Why should I give a shit?

421
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,060
And then what?

422
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
That's it.
That's when I woke up

423
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,840
I took out my notebook
and I wrote it all down

424
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,390
and to be honest with you, I don't
know what to think about it.

425
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,660
What bothers you
about this dream?

426
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,780
The military Jeep?
The bouquet of flowers?

427
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,710
Or is it that you're dressed
as a woman, tell me.

428
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,110
None of that.

429
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,950
It's just the presence
of an old man in my dreams.

430
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,320
I'm not used to dreaming about
old people.

431
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,160
I mean I never do that.

432
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
What does that mean?

433
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,030
It's really worrying me.

434
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,110
I don't think it means anything.

435
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,660
For me to be honest,
what worries me, Henri

436
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,290
is the length of your dream.

437
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,270
Really? The length?

438
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,520
Let's say it's not
really finished.

439
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,900
It's a very short dream.

440
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
You have got me used
to more depth.

441
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,490
Well, yeah. I just woke up
it's not my fault.

442
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,490
Why do you think you woke up?

443
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
In your opinion.

444
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,600
Try to stay focused, Henri.

445
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,190
Answer my question.

446
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,690
Why did you wake up?

447
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,810
I just woke up.
There's no reason.

448
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,690
Are you at least sure
you had this dream?

449
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,600
Think about what I just said.

450
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,360
I'll be back in a second.

451
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,690

Can you stop that moronic screaming?

452
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,770
I'm with a patient!
What's the idea?

453
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,640
I'm practicing for my film.

454
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,550
You're a nuisance! Go away!

455
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,310
For god's sake!

456
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,380
Henri, we still have 10 minutes.

457
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,720
I'm good. I think
we had enough for today.

458
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,380
I think, I bored you
enough as it is.

459
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,220
What are you talking about?

460
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,260
Sit down, will you?
We have to finish the session.

461
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,880
No. I'd rather go.

462
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,600
And I'll come back to you when I have
more finished dream for you next time.

463
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,470
I can tell you're not interested
in me at all today.

464
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,220
- Sorry.
- Are you busy today?

465
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,500
What's your schedule?

466
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,510
I have to work.

467
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,470
You mean, recording noises?

468
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,630
Not just noises.
There's more to it...

469
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,580
But whatever. Why do you ask?

470
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,630
You drove my patient away.

471
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,210
At a key moment,
you distracted me and he left.

472
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,830
Sorry hon.
I didn't think you'd hear me.

473
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,510
Stay in your car, please.

474
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,950
Okay, I understand.

475
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,200
All day. I finish at 6.
No screams before then.

476
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,870
- I'll work here, no problem.
- Thanks!

477
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,830
See you for lunch, though?

478
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,950
All right.

479
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,330
Well, okay. You can get dressed again.
I've seen what I wanted to see.

480
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,160
Ah, what is it?

481
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,200
That's exactly what I thought.

482
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,240
It is indeed an eczema attack
but on the inside.

483
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,900
On the inside?

484
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,900
Yes. On the inside
of your head.

485
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,330
What does that mean?

486
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,750
Well, it means a lot
of unpleasant things

487
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,360
that I'm just gonna
keep to myself.

488
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,450
If you wanted a doctor's note,
you came to the wrong place.

489
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,400
You can not play me
for an idiot.

490
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,330
Oh, uh..
What?

491
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,770
Get out of my office now.
Alright?

492
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,140
You've wasted enough of my time.

493
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,110
You are horrible.

494
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,900
Yes, I know.
Thank you for reminding me.

495
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,940
Now, get out, don't come back.

496
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,230
You should be ashamed.

497
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,990
Yeah, exactly I am ashamed.

498
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,190
I can't go to the pool anymore.

499
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,790
People keep looking at me like I
am gonna contaminate the water.

500
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,600
Of course I am ashamed.
Look at me.

501
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,030
I'm sick and you know it.
You've gotta help me!

502
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,680
I can't keep scratching myself
forever, I'm gonna go crazy.

503
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,220
Just stop acting right now.

504
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,390
Because you're not believable
for a second.

505
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,940
You don't have anything
and you know that very well.

506
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,270
So get the hell out of here!

507
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,760
Or I'm gonna file a complaint.

508
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,600
Goodbye.

509
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:15,270

Groan 44.

510
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,760
Groan 45.

511
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,100

Groan... 47?

512
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,340
 And now, the award for
the best groan in movie history goes to...

513
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,750

What the fuck are you doing?

514
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,500
- Huh?
- It's late! Stop dicking around!

515
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,420
I didn't notice the time.

516
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,290
- What a crazy dream!
- Come on, I'm tired.

517
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,330
Listen to this crazy dream I had!

518
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,250
Tomorrow. I have a free slot at 11.

519
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,720
- Just listen, don't analyze.
- Tomorrow!

520
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
Jacques, now that our audience
knows you a little bit better

521
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,170
why don't you tell them about
the dessert that you've chosen.

522
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,870
We are all very impatient
and... and very much listening.

523
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,170
Uh, yes. I've chosen
the strawberry Charlotte.

524
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,620
The strawberry Charlotte, in a few words
tell us about the strawberry Charlotte.

525
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,630
Uh, yes. Well, um, it's a very
simple cake and easy to make.

526
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,250
Can you hurry, sugar pie?

527
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,780
We're leaving in 5 minutes.

528
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,370
Okay. Alright.

529
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,830
And they are not
too gross to touch..

530
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,910
Come on, reality, move it.

531
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,070
We're late.

532
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,210
Oh! Fuck.

533
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,950
God dammit.

534
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,690
Do we have a first aid kit?

535
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,820
Okay. Fuck!
It hurts like hell.

536
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,440
What the fuck were you thinking?

537
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,830
- Argh, I really hurt myself.
- Just...

538
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,400

Wait, alright?

539
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,810
don't move just a second.

540
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,190
Hello?

541
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,610
Um. I just spoke to Denis
on the phone.

542
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,100
Yeah, what's up with him?

543
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,270
He's not getting better.
He can't come in today.

544
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,240
And he didn't sound good at all.
He was crying.

545
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,350
What a fucking pain in the ass.

546
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,310
Apparently, he is itching
twice as much today.

547
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,820
Good morning
this is your captain speaking.

548
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,690
The leper is not
comin' in today.

549
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,210
Let's pack it up people,
this day is over.

550
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Shit.

551
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,160
Hey, hi.

552
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,530
What?

553
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,540
Yeah, we don't know each other.

554
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,830
I am the camera 3 operator.

555
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

556
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,780
No..
I... I was just wondering..

557
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,990
Do you think you could do the
same scream that you did earlier?

558
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,690
You know when you hurt yourself.

559
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,360
Aah! Could you do
the same?

560
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,450
Scream exact
the same scream again?

561
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,400
No. I don't think so.

562
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,290
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Too bad.

563
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,860
You know I really hurt myself.

564
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,520
Are you stupid or somethin'?

565
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,820
No, I was just asking.

566
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,730
I thought your screaming
was great.

567
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,690
Whatever.

568
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,650
Moron.

569
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,200
So, before we look in detail
at its digestive system

571
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,850
there is something really
important we need to understand.

572
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,020
Now, the hog is an
omnivorous animal.

573
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,570
Does anybody know what
omnivorous means?

574
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,900
Uh, I do.

575
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,980
Uh, I know, ma'am.

576
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,850
Okay, serge, tell us

577
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,110
omnivorous, that means
he'll eat everything.

578
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,280
Good. Okay everything.

579
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,010
But what does everything mean?

580
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,760
Can you give us an example

581
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,930
uh, well, he can eat
salad for example

582
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,360
okay good, salad.
Uh, what else?

583
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,760
Rotten fruit.

584
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,100
Good. Rotten fruit. Uh, and?

585
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,930
Mushrooms.

586
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,640
Good. Mushrooms.

587
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,760
Now, some of those
are what are known as plants.

588
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,810
But what else does it eat?

589
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,970
Oh, oh, um..
He also eats other animals too.

590
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,720
Exactly. Animals.

591
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,550
Okay, so this is really
important to remember.

592
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,420
Everybody take your pens.

593
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,960
Good, and I want you to write...
Teacher.

594
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes, reality.

595
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,090
A hog can also swallow a
videotape without damaging it.

596
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,050
But it's true.

597
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,720
Whoo-hoo!

598
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,750
What are you doing here?

599
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,000
Nothing.

600
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,490
You know you are not allowed in any
classroom during recess, right?

601
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,670
You broke the rules.
I am very upset

602
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,490
sorry, Mr. superintendent.

603
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,620
I promise that
I won't do it again.

604
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,860
What was on that tape
you wanted to watch?

605
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,700
It's a videotape I found.

606
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,280
It could be that there
is nothing on it.

607
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,940
I just wanted to check.

608
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,650
Let me see it.

609
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,940
No. You'll take it away.

610
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,860
I just wanna see what's written
on it. Give me the tape.

611
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,700
There's nothing written on it.

612
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,530
Well, I still wanna see it.

613
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,900
No!

614
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,580
You'll keep it.

615
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,730
And then I'll never
get to see what's on it.

616
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,320
Reality, give me the tape
or I'm gonna call your parents.

617
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,150
If you call my parents..

618
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,610
Then I'll tell everyone
you dress up like a woman.

619
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,400
Wha..
Wha..

620
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,730
Me?

621
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:45,980
Are you kidding?

622
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,640
I saw you.

623
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,440
Driving a military Jeep.

624
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,740
Dressed like a woman.

625
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,600
No, you didn't.

626
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,150

Groan 65.

627
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,890

You're still at it?

628
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,570
I can't believe it.

629
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,260
I'm nearly done.
Just re-listening.

630
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,850
Are you satisfied?

631
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,690
Not especially.

632
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,220
Did Kubrick spend hours
recording himself stupid?

633
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,230
This is research. Why stupid?

634
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,430
Am I stupid?

635
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,380
You tell me.

636
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:31,420
Did Kubrick research his movies
by taping groans in his pajamas?

637
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,760

I don't give a shit for Kubrick.

638
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,800
He works his way, I work mine.

639
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,090
Why shouldn't I work in pajamas?

640
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,090
Take it easy! I'm trying to understand.

641
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,130
You just look a bit silly.

642
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,460
Okay.

643
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,000

Thanks for your support!

644
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,390
Really!

645
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,790
What do I know about movies?

646
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,220
Kubrick, my ass!

647
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,000
Kubrick, my ass!

648
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,090
 And now, the award for
the best groan in movie history goes to...

649
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,130
Jason tantra!

650
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:13,120
 I can't stand up.
I can’t stand up!

651
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,380
I'm stuck... to the seat.

652
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,200
I'm stuck to the seat.

653
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,580
I'm stuck!

654
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,580
I'm stuck to the seat.

655
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,780
I'm stuck!

656
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,450
Stuck!

657
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,540

Dirty little fuckers!

658
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,420
Flaunting their boards.

659
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,200
Jason tantra's on the line.

660
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,450
What's he got?

661
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:06,040
Mr. Marshall wishes to know
if you have anything.

662
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:11,900
Well no, that's the problem.
I'm running around in circles.

663
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,610
Could you tell him I...

664
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,900
I lost track of what I'm looking for.

665
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,040
It's harder than I thought.

666
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,900
I'm scared
I'll miss the 48-hour deadline.

667
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,230
Can Mr. Marshall reassure me?

668
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,370
Hold on.

669
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,560
He is working,
but he's lost track.

670
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,730
He's running around in circles.
It’s starting to scare him.

671
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,410
He's scared he'll go over 48 hours.

672
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,900
He needs reassurance.

673
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,770
So reassure him.

674
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,520

Why don’t you take a break?

675
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,610
It will do you good.

676
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,060
- You think so?
- Yes.

677
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,280
Why not go to the pool
for a change of scene?

678
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,900
No, but...

679
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,280
I don't like swimming.
I'm no good at it.

680
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,680
Then why not a museum or a movie?

681
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,350
There are many enjoyable movies out.

682
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,290
They'll wash your brain.

683
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,030
Yeah, yeah... maybe.

684
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,990
don't stew in your own juice.

685
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,670
You're freaking out.
It's not good.

686
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,370
He can have 24 more hours.

687
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,200
Mr. Marshall gives you 24 more hours.

688
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,700
Great!

689
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,690
I want an Oscar for the groan!

690
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,620
Mr. Marshall says he wants
an Oscar for the groan.

691
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,240
I know.

692
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,940
That's the problem.

693
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,030
Cheer up.

694
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,230
Good luck.

695
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,150
But then...

696
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,320
How long do I have left
including the bonus?

697
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,700
Hello.

698
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,940
There you go.
Enjoy the movie.

699
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,810
What kind of movie is it?

700
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
Is it funny or more romantic?

701
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,310
I'm not allowed to answer
that kind of question, ma'am.

702
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,940
You'll see.
Uhhuh.

703
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,060
Can you move along, please.
You're holding up the line.

704
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,270
Okay.

705
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,640
Okay.
Hmm.

706
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:11,230
Hey.

707
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,220

What?

708
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,470
It's the title of my film.

709
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,550
"Waves."
"Waves."

710
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,600

That's your "awesome" title?

711
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,840
Someone had the same idea.

712
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,680
Sure it's your title?

713
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,840
Yes! I know my own title.

714
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,220
It's "waves." Like microwaves.

715
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:37,730
It's a good time to change it.
"Waves" sounds awful.

716
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,590
You're kidding! I love it!

717
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,010
Excuse me. Uh, when does
this movie come out? Waves?

718
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,420
It's already out, sir.
It's playing now.

719
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,550
Can you move aside please,
you're blocking the other customers.

720
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,300
Uh, we're gonna
change the tickets

721
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,170
because we're going to watch it
instead. Is that possible?

722
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,100
What?

723
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,630
I'm sorry, it started
45 minutes ago.

724
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,540
Yes. It's alright. It's good.

725
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,790
Doesn't matter.
Can we change the tickets?

726
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,880
As you wish.

727
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,080
 Not if it's started
and it's called "waves!”

728
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,540
I care about it, honey!

729
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,760
Please move along.

730
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,000
Thank you.

731
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,160
Next.

732
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,660

You're a pain!

733
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,330
God! It's my film!

734
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,830
I swear it's exactly my film.

735
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,920

Fuck!

736
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,620
Be quiet!
You're disturbing everybody.

737
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,320
Two years of hard work!

738
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,700
don't blame me!
I didn't want to see it.

739
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:42,910
See?

740
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,950

It's my film.

741
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,610

I can't take this.

742
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,490
I'm sorry. Listen to me,
you can't watch this.

743
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,860
Uh, this film doesn't exist yet.

744
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,120
I am the director, it's my film.

745
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,950
I just finished the script
and you can't watch it now.

746
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,190
Move!

747
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,410
This film doesn't
really exist yet!

748
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,700
We haven't shot it yet.

749
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,990
So, you can go and see
another movie. Thank you.

750
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:44,660
- Go?
- The groans are bad.

751
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,480
They're gonna to be better
when I will work on it.

752
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,480
So thank you, can we stop the...
Get out!

753
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,640
- The screening?
- Move it.

754
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:53,940
- Go!
- Please.

755
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,430
The groans are... are bad.

756
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,600
You don't understand.

757
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,190
Get the fuck out of the way!

758
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,850
I have to work on it.

759
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,150
This movie doesn't
really exists.

760
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,440
Move it.

761
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm tryin' to watch
the fuckin' movie.

762
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,650

Work on it. Find the groan.

763
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,480
It's key.

764
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,510
I want the best groan in movie history.

765
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,890
I'm going home.
You're too embarrassing!

766
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,680
Thanks for the fun time!

767
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,190
I want the best groan in movie history.

768
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,340
I mean it.

769
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,470
I want an Oscar for it. You hear me?

770
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,680
Fine.

771
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,090
Fuck the rest.

772
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,180
Do your thing,
simplify it, I don't care.

773
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:48,300
-  I don't know what to say.
- Take 48 hours.

774
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,520
Call me when you're ready.

775
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,170
If I like the groans, we'll sign,

776
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,550
you'll make your movie.

777
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,880
Is it a deal?

778
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,090
Great to hear you. Jason here.

779
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,300
- Sorry to bother...
- Just a sec.

780
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,250
Weird! It's you on the line.

781
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,000
Sorry?

782
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,550
This is you on the line.

783
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,680
What do you mean? I'm here.

784
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,590
Where are you?

785
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,380
Outdoors, on the street.

786
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,210
An awful thing has happened.
I don't know how to say it.

787
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:41,330
It's about the movie.
There's a big problem.

788
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,210
I'm not sure how to explain
what happened.

789
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,120
I may even pass out.

790
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,330
Wait! Breathe deeply, don't faint.
What problem, Jason?

791
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,910
Who are you talking to?
I'm here.

792
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,130
Go on.

793
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
It may sound insane,

794
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,240
but I just saw my movie in a theater.

795
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:06,210
What did you say?

796
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:11,280
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

797
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:15,700
I just saw my film
in a theater with an audience.

798
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,830

The film exists. I saw it.

799
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,910
And it sucks.

800
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,360
He says he saw his movie,
I mean your movie, and it sucks.

801
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,370
I had the exact same dream last night.

802
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,700
I saw my movie in a theater
and tried to stop it.

803
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,820
That's it.

804
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,610
- My nightmare.
- Listen Jason, don't panic.

805
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,120
You're in a bad dream.

806
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,830
Relax, try not to think about it

807
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,900
and you'll wake up.

808
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,990
Hello, Bob?

809
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,650
Hello? Hello, Bob?

810
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,100

Fuck!

811
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,850
Baby, aren't you taping?

812
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,530
That groan was awesome.
You should tape it.

813
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,740
Where's the damn recorder?

814
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,310

Look in the lining of your jacket.

815
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,650
The hole, you know?
Where you always lose your keys.

816
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,390
Ah, yes.

817
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,390

Got it.

818
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,340
Ha! Okay.

819
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,570

Damn.

820
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,120
I've stopped groaning.

821
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,320

What, honey?

822
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,610
The pain's gone.

823
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:39,150

I didn't tape the perfect groan.

824
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,320
Shit!

825
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,870
Excuse me. Hi.

826
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,490
Hello.

827
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:11,730
I need to borrow your rifle,
just for a minute.

828
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,320
I'm doing research for sounds,
I'm making movies.

829
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,480
You can take this one.
It's an old thing, I don't use it much.

830
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,690
Be careful though. It's loaded.

831
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,780
Okay.

832
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,530
Hey!

833
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:33,890
You're going to be
late for work.

834
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,190

Shit!

835
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,820
Who was that guy, daddy?

836
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,640
- Where?
- Well, there. Outside.

837
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:56,310
You were talking to somebody.

838
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:57,970
I wasn't talking to anybody.

839
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,810
Go back to sleep, sugar pie.

840
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:02,310
But I wasn't sleeping.

841
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,220
What is that?

842
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,150
That must be my alarm clock.

843
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,720
Well turn it off!
It's unbearable!

844
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,590
Hey! Hey!

845
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,260
What are you doing?

846
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:27,690
Where are going with that?

847
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,220
I'm going to watch the tape.

848
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,470
Not now.

849
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,470
That isn't the plan.

850
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,840
For now, you're sleeping.

851
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,180
But I am sick of sleeping!

852
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,920
I want to know
what's on the tape!

853
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,180
Shh, shh, shh. You're going
to wake your parents up.

854
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,260
Now come on, go back to bed.

855
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,210
I'm the one who makes
the decisions, right?

856
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,180
I am so sick of this movie!

857
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,670
This sucks! What a pain!

858
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,670
I'd set my alarm, on purpose!

859
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,460
Why can't I watch the tape?

860
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,620
Just be a little patient.
Trust me.

861
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,120
Come on, go back to sleep!

862
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:09,160
Nobody's gonna want to watch
this scene where I am sleeping!

863
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,000
Nobody cares!

864
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,500
It's for the suspense!

865
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,160
Close your eyes.
Sleep!

866
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,250
There you go.
I'm sleeping.

867
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:21,830
Great movie!

868
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,250
Jacques, you are my guest today.

869
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,910
Yes.

870
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,340
You are a school teacher,
you like nature

871
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:34,570
you are an avid viewer
of talk shows

872
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,160
and you collect Russian watches
from the 70's.

873
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,990
Yes. Exactly.

874
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,670
You are 54 years old.

875
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:44,080
Yes, that's the truth
you are a widower.

876
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,660
Yes.

877
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,200
Do you believe in god?

878
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,700
Hmm? Yes.

879
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,740
Yes.
Mmhmm.

880
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,080
So what should we begin with?

881
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,080
In... in your opinion?

882
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,650
Maybe we could wash
the strawberries.

883
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,790
Personally, that's
my favorite part.

884
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,870
Well, okay.
Let's start.

885
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,610
Do you have any
special technique?

886
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,020
Yes.

887
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,940
I put the strawberries
in a damp cloth

888
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,320
and then I rub them
ever so gently.

889
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,610
Jason, wake up! Hey! Wake up,
man. We've got work to do!

890
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,350
- Jason!
- What's going on with him?

891
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,610
I don't know, he just fell.

892
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,280
Hey everyone, I'm here!

893
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,350
I'm ready to shoot this,
so let's..

894
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,430
Wake up! Hey, man,
it's not nap time.

895
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,770
- Jason?
- We got work to do.

896
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,350
Wake up!

897
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,010
- Sorry.
- Up.

898
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,010
Hey! Come on, wake up!

899
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,180
Sir!

900
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,760
Hello.

901
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:23,590
Hey!

902
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,010
Woo-hoo!

903
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,520
Sir! Hey come on, wake up!

904
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,300

You're missing the movie!

905
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,980
Sir? Sir?

906
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:36,630
Come on, wake up!

907
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,380
Woo-hoo.

908
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,210

Wake up!

909
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,460
Sir? Sir?

910
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,800

Wake up, dammit!

911
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,960
I don't have time for this shit!

912
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,670
Come on, wake up!

913
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,920

Wake up!

914
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,670
What's... what's happening?
I'm... I'm confused.

915
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,680
It is indeed an eczema
attack, but on the inside.

916
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,580
On the inside of your head.

917
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,590

Wake up!

918
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,500
Hey, come on, wake up! Sir?

919
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,330
Come on. Wake up!

920
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,620
Ha!

921
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,260
What's the matter, dude?

922
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,410
Are you okay?

923
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,710
 Yeah.
I'm fine.

924
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,660
Hey, come on, wake up!

925
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Sir?

926
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,960
Okay.

927
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:46,340
We need to talk. Uh, I think
we are the same person.

928
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:52,410
I've been having some weird
dreams where I'm you.

929
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,750
I... I don't know, I know it
doesn't make any sense but..

930
01:09:56,830 --> 01:10:00,580
I think we are the same person.
I don't know why.

931
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,740

What's going on?

932
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,570
She's about to see
what's on the videotape.

933
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,650
I see that, but it's badly shot!

934
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:59,070
We can't see what she's seeing.
Why choose that angle?

935
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,110
Mr. Marshall says
it is very poorly filmed.

936
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,360
And he wants to know why you
chose this angle.

937
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,520
Because it's beautiful.

938
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,360

Because it's beautiful.

939
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,110
Okay, it's beautiful,

940
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,560
but what the fuck is she watching?

941
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,440
We need to know what's on the tape!

942
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:20,060
Bob wants to know
what's on the tape.

943
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,980
He has to be patient.

944
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:25,560

He asks you to be patient.

945
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,820
My Patience is limited.

946
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,810
Does he even know what's on it?
Maybe he hasn't thought it out yet.

947
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:38,060
Bob is wondering if you
know what is on the tape.

948
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,060
I know perfectly well
what is on this tape

949
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,820
but I'm not going to tell him
before he finds out himself

950
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:47,320
it'd ruin the surprise.
He has to be patient.

951
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,080

He says, be patient.

952
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,950
I'm warning you, Zog.
The more I wait, the more I want.

953
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,580
-  Hello.
- Hello.

954
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,450
I want to be locked up.

955
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,110
I'm losing my grip.

956
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,620
I need treatment and help.

957
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,200
Fine.
Come with me.

958
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,490
This way.

959
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,030
Here we are!

960
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,780
Make yourself comfortable.

961
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,820
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Thanks.

962
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,980
Shall I take your gun?

963
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,270
Yes, sorry.

964
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,440

Mr. Marshall,

965
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:13,780
Jason tantra's on the line.

966
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,900
Will he never give up?

967
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,030
Keep it short, Jason. I'm busy.

968
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:28,520
Sorry to bother you.

969
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:35,020
I wanted to warn you
I may be late with the groan.

970
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,360
What are you doing?

971
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:40,690
I have other fish to fry, dammit!
I can't wait forever.

972
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:43,350
I gave you 48 hours,
plus a 24 hour bonus.

973
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:47,070
You need a week to find a groan.
How long to shoot a movie?

974
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:51,180
Yes, but... Everything's
gone wrong.

975
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,970
Nothing fits.
I need time to get myself together.

976
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:59,100
What doesn't fit?
Are you sick?

977
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,600
It may sound dumb,
but I'm stuck in a nightmare.

978
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,470
I know it.

979
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,050
But then again,

980
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:13,800
the good news is, if it's a nightmare
I'll have to wake up.

981
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,890
But...
I don't know when.

982
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:22,090
I can't guarantee to deliver you a groan
as long as I'm stuck in the nightmare.

983
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,840
Good god!

984
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,600
Does that make sense
if you're not in the nightmare?

985
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,760
Do you understand?

986
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,800
Holy shit!

987
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,340
Jason, I'll put you on hold...

988
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,590
Hang on a second.

989
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:44,840
I'm flabbergasted.

990
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,710
He's a genius.
A fucking genius!

991
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,500
Bob says you are a genius.

992
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,170
You like it?

993
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,420
I don't know how to tell you,
I'm flabbergasted.

994
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,750
It's not finished.

995
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,680
No, but right now
I'm speechless.

996
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,830
My brain is in my socks
as they say.

997
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:18,760

Hello.

998
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,120
What's that?

999
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:25,000
- A suppository, to help you sleep.
- No, no...

1000
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:29,290
No need. I'm in a nightmare.
I'm already fast asleep.

1001
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,620
No need for a suppository, thanks.

1002
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:36,210
Come on, now.
It's nothing at all.

1003
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,950
It won't take a second.

1004
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,490
You don't understand.
I am asleep.

1005
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:44,240
Anyway, can't it wait?
I'm on the phone here, see?

1006
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,950
It's not plugged in, sir.

1007
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,420
Roll over a little. Roll over.

1008
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:52,990
Please. It will help you relax.

1009
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,570

There! Not so awful, was it?

1010
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:05,450
Night-night, sleep tight!

1011
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:07,400
Sleep in my nightmare?

1012
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:08,650
Thanks a bunch!

1013
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,360
I'll leave you for an hour or so.

1014
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,190

Jason, you still there?

1015
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,780
- Yes.
- Your groan was perfect!

1016
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,790
Your movie is a go.

1017
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:23,610
We'll sign on Monday.
Till then, rest up.

1018
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:25,860
What?

1019
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:29,860
Hello, Bob?

1020
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:32,070

Bob, what groan?

1021
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,060
There you go.
That's all for today.

1022
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,240

Incredible!

1023
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,950
Really incredible!

1024
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,650
So beautiful, I could cry.
Let me kiss you.

1025
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:47,270
Thank you.

1026
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,780
Words fail me. I'm speechless!

1027
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,070
Thank you.

1028
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,980
Hey, Zog!

1029
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,270

You're a fucking genius!

1030
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:20,430
What'd he say?

1031
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,760
He said you're a fucking genius.

1032
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,770
Yeah.

1033
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,190

Thanks!

1034
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,730
His name is Zog?

1035
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:28,810
Yes.

1036
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,600
Just Zog? No surname?

1037
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:31,800
Yes.

1038
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,090
Who is he?

1039
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,010
An ex-documentary maker.

1040
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,810
I picked him up out of the gutter.

1041
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:39,600
He's a handful,

1042
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,600
but very talented.

1043
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,430
His movie is stunning.

1044
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,140
The end

1045
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,520
 Bye, Mr. Marshall.
I'm very happy.

1046
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,840
Call me Bob now.
Get to work, pal.

1047
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:30,220
Here I go.

1048
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,210
- 48 hours.
- Yes sir!

1049
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,840
- Good luck.
- Yes.

1050
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:37,090
So...
See you soon, Bob.

1051
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,250
Yes!

1052
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:28,890
So, do you have
a special technique?

1053
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,540
Yes, I put the strawberries
in a damp cloth

1054
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:37,680
and then I rub them
ever so gently.

1055
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,040
That way, you don't
damage the skin.

1056
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,220
You could show us,
it would be easier.

1057
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,010
Gladly.

1058
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:55,540
What's happening?
I'm confused.

1059
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,700
It is indeed an eczema attack

1060
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,120
but on the inside.

1061
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:01,460
On the inside of your head.
