00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,651
I appreciate it. I mean-

174
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,021
I also told them you're
not ready for custody, yet.

175
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,089
- Wait? What?
- JJ-just need-

176
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,091
- You're keeping my kid from me?
- need a little more time.

177
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,493
- No, no, Billy, Billy...
- I'm thinking about your daughter.

178
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,994
- I'm thinking about Lexi.
- I've been here over five months, man.

179
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:07,299
I'm thinking about her, okay?
She needs a dad that's a hundred percent.

180
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,733
- And I want you...
- I am a hundred percent.

181
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,068
- That's why I'm here.
- A hundred percent fully at the end of this.

182
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,369
That's why I'm here, Billy.

183
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,439
[Billy] Okay, okay,
just a little more time.

184
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:17,978
Come here.

185
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,249
Forget it.

186
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,485
[baby giggling on phone]

187
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,322
[Lexi] <i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

188
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,127
How about you come home with me?
You can meet my daughter.

189
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,531
Lexi would love you.

190
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,067
You wanna meet her?

191
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,403
Hello.

192
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,138
Hey, mom.

193
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,308
I'm okay.

194
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:54,348
It's just this... I guess

195
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,051
they told the courts I'm
not ready for custody.

196
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,357
Where... where did they
tell her I am? On vacation?

197
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,628
She said she wants to
be with me on vacation?

198
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,632
That's really...
that's really sweet.

199
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:17,037
No, I tried calling but she
won't let me talk to her.

200
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:20,173
No, she won't even let me
talk to her on the phone.

201
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,175
No, it's... it's... it's
like for nothing.

202
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,380
If I came out here for Lexi
and then I can't even see her.

203
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,551
I just want to be done.

204
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,521
Like with all of this,
I just want to be done.

205
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,256
Okay.

206
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,658
Yes, I promise.

207
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,662
I promise I will try
and have some fun.

208
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,596
Okay.

209
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,666
I love you, too.

210
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,602
All right.

211
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,404
Bye.

212
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:12,490
- Sam, look at this-
- Hey.

213
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,693
- It's cute, right?
- Yeah, it's really cute.

214
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:15,696
What size is that?

215
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,265
A small.

216
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:19,999
You should put on
hold for yourself.

217
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,434
- Right?
- I'll put it on hold for later.

218
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,537
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,474
So, I'm going out
with that guy tonight.

220
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,278
- Amazing! Where you guys gonna hang?
- I don't know yet.

221
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,914
But I wanna ask you
a quick question.

222
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:35,848
Okay.

223
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,517
- So JJ is in rehab and...
- He's in rehab?

224
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,954
Well, it's not a real rehab it's
like a sober living facility.

225
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:44,255
But I didn't want to tell you because I knew
you'd freak out like you are right now.

226
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,223
I'm not freaking out.

227
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,324
Kind of.

228
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,392
You kind of are.

229
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,861
Okay, okay, I'm not.

230
00:13:48,863 --> 00:13:50,930
Um, do you think that it would be
okay for me to get a drink with him

231
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:52,432
or is it like bad because
he's going to rehab?

232
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:57,569
Why do you want to hang with a guy in
rehab if you can just meet another guy?

233
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,105
'Cause it's literally perfect.

234
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:01,573
He's just gonna be here a few days,
we'll have some fun and then he's gone.

235
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,676
It's nothing serious.

236
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,945
He's perfect.

237
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,980
[Megan] That's either
brilliant or twisted.

238
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,416
- [Sam] Thank you.
- [laughs]

239
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:28,700
<i>♪ I think I'll get too high
When I'm next to you ♪</i>

240
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,567
Hi.

241
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,003
- Hey. How are you?
- Good.

242
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,270
- How are you?
- Good.

243
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,240
- Do you want to get in and we can go?
- I don't think so.

244
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,544
- What?
- I want you to get out of the car and hug me.

245
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,577
What? Oh my God,
no, just get in the car.

246
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,579
I'm not getting in till
you get out and hug me.

247
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,481
- No! Just get in the car!
- You wanna go? Cool. Come on.

248
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,318
Oh my God.

249
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,597
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

250
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,531
- Feel good?
- Yes.

251
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,198
- Should we go?
- Yeah, we can go.

252
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,199
- Okay, great.
- Let's go.

253
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,468
- Are you hungry? Where are we going?
- Yeah.

254
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,770
- Okay, do you like sushi?
- No, I hate it.

255
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,472
What? Really? It's my favorite.

256
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,407
I think it's so gross.

257
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,375
I don't think this
is gonna work.

258
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,676
Yeah. Me either.

259
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,545
- Just pull over, I can just hop off now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:16,015
I'm kidding. Go. Go, go, go.
You can go wherever you want.

261
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,682
Okay, perfect.

262
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:18,685
You look beautiful.

263
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,753
Even better than your profile.

264
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,655
- Really?
- Yeah, you can't always say that for people.

265
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,024
- Some people...
- Yeah.

266
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:27,325
You see their profile and you
meet them in person, it's like-

267
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,593
They catfish you.

268
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,328
- Do you feel like I... I live up to my photos?
- Absolutely.

269
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,696
Yeah?

270
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,932
Oh, you?

271
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,666
- Yes, me.
- Oh, oh, we're not talking about me anymore.

272
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,035
[JJ] No.

273
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,636
- You think you live up to your own photos? Wow.
- [Sam laughs]

274
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,637
- Yeah.
- [JJ] Wow.

275
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,341
- [Sam] No.
- [JJ] Someone is a little stuck up.

276
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,575
I like your tattoo.

277
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,710
Mm. Don't look at it.

278
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,713
- Why?
- 'Cause I don't like to show people.

279
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:53,384
Now why would you get a tattoo, something
that's gonna be on your body probably forever,

280
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,121
and you don't want
anyone to see it?

281
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:58,824
'Cause I got it when I was seventeen and it's
really dumb and I want to get it removed.

282
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,558
Okay, fair enough.

283
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,062
- Do you have any tattoos?
- Yeah, I got a couple.

284
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:03,764
Show me.

285
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,799
Oh, cool.

286
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:07,933
I actually want
to get a lip tattoo.

287
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,869
- Yeah?
- I heard that those wear off after a while.

288
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,403
That's what they say. I've
had them on like six years.

289
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,340
- Did it hurt?
- A little, but I can handle it.

290
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,777
- Mm-Hm.
- Yeah. [scoffs]

291
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,612
I wanted to get another one while I was
in town but just didn't get a chance.

292
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:21,881
How you've been so far?

293
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:25,385
Six-month program and I'm... I'm
almost done, so about that long.

294
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,688
Has it been difficult,
the program?

295
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:32,557
Uh, yeah.

296
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,126
Yeah, it has in some ways.

297
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:35,094
But I wanted to do it.

298
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:35,762
Yeah?

299
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,730
I got a daughter at home.

300
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,132
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,633
- Wow.
- Is that weird?

302
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,568
That's cool. I have some
friends that have kids.

303
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,703
Yeah. I'm gonna be that dad right
now and I'm gonna show you a picture.

304
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,873
- I would love to see a picture.
- All right.

305
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,475
- Gosh, she's beautiful!
- Yeah, right?

306
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,744
- Yes. What's her name?
- Lexi.

307
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,914
She's so beautiful.

308
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,714
That girl... little
girl's my princess.

309
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,582
Wow.

310
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,716
I miss her so much.

311
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,585
So is her mom
still on the picture?

312
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,720
- Wait, you're not married or something, are you?
- No.

313
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,721
No, no, no.

314
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,857
Okay.

315
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,591
Lexi's mom and I haven't
been together in a long time.

316
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,527
We're friends though.

317
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,933
- Do you guys think you'll ever get back together?
- Nah.

318
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,633
I think we're better as friends
than when we're together.

319
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,170
That's good, for Lexi at least.

320
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:20,505
My parents separated
when I was really young.

321
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,473
Was hard on me
but you get over it.

322
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,943
- You have any siblings?
- Nope.

323
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:25,811
- Only child right here.
- Okay.

324
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:27,146
That explains a lot.

325
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:29,414
- Rude.
- Yeah, it does.

326
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,548
I'm just teasing.

327
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,951
I have a big family though.

328
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,185
Yeah? You close with them?

329
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:36,521
Yeah, super close to my
siblings, really close to my mom.

330
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,790
- You close with your parents?
- Yeah.

331
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,193
Actually I'm really
close with my dad.

332
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,763
Was really hard on him when
I moved out here on my own.

333
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,799
He wants me to move
back and work for him.

334
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,766
He does investment banking.

335
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:49,634
Wow.

336
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,736
- You gonna do it?
- I don't think so.

337
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,941
I don't know. I don't really
know what I want to do.

338
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,708
Well, if you could do anything in
the world what would you want to do?

339
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,476
I don't know.

340
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,644
Anything in the world.

341
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,479
I want to do a lot of things.

342
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,683
- It's hard to say these days, you know?
- What's hard about that?

343
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,786
Figuring out what you
want to do with your life.

344
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:12,892
Like, think about it... our great-grandparents
never had dreams of being millionaires.

345
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:16,527
I mean they just worked a really hard
job they hated to put food on the table,

346
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,630
to provide a better
life for their children.

347
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:22,001
Then our grandparents just wanted to make
enough so that their kids, our parents,

348
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:26,571
could go to college and be doctors
or lawyers or engineers and they did.

349
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,876
And then we come along and our parents tell
us that we can do anything we dream of,

350
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,946
which is a lie, but we
believe them and we try and fail

351
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,647
at doing these things
we think we're good at

352
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,515
but never actually get
any work ethic or drive,

353
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,285
never becoming functioning
members of society.

354
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:43,554
And then internet and social media comes along
and people are creating websites and apps

355
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,891
and becoming the youngest
billionaires of all time.

356
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:49,661
People on reality stars make millions
of dollars for being themselves on TV.

357
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:54,632
And suddenly we all feel like if we are
thirty and don't have a few mil in the bank

358
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,335
then we're a failure.

359
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:59,004
I mean our grandparents would have never even
dreamed of being millionaires by thirty,

360
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,505
maybe not even ever.

361
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,978
But for us that's the norm. I mean
that kind of pressure is ridiculous.

362
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,649
So, no, I have no idea
what I want to do.

363

00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:56,957
Just so good.

682
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,891
I have a crush on him.

683
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:00,892
- I did.
- Yeah?

684
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:01,927
In <i>Jumanji.</i>

685
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,028
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my gosh!

686
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,963
I've always really
liked older men.

687
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,900
- Like my first crush...
- [both chuckle]

688
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:14,172
- Okay, continue.
- Really, my first crush was Mel Gibson in <i>The Patriot.</i>

689
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:15,607
Wow!

690
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:18,245
- Which it would have been normal for it to be like Heath Ledger.
- Mm-hm.

691
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:24,249
We are officially out of wine.

692
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,617
Let's go get some more.

693
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,221
- You want to?
- Yeah.

694
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:31,258
- Are you going to?
- Here I am.

695
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,860
JJ reporting live from
the scene of the crime.

696
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,329
- Oh God!
- Apparently, someone has stolen all of the wine...

697
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,598
- No!
- In all of Los Angeles.

698
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,933
- What are we gonna do?
- We have suspicion that

699
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:44,303
it is a young woman under
the name of Sammy.

700
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:46,004
- [gasps]
- And she's ran off with all the wine.

701
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:48,106
- Oh my God!
- We are now in pursuit.

702
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,875
We're gonna go
live on the scene.

703
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:51,145
Why would she do that?

704
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,246
- She's an alcoholic.
- [chuckles]

705
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:55,349
She needs it.

706
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,116
She can't get enough of it.

707
00:41:58,118 --> 00:41:58,950
Look at her!

708
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:01,355
- Oh, drinking so...
- [both laugh]

709
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:05,957
Look at her.

710
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:08,028
Look at her, she's right here.

711
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:11,963
- Caught red-handed!
- How much did that...?

712
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,436
Why would I ever, you know?

713
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:24,276
Here she is.

714
00:42:24,278 --> 00:42:26,013
Our last night together.

715
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,115
Bye.

716
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:33,418
- Bye.
- Bye, over you.

717
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,224
She's really rude to me,
but I think deep down she cares about me.

718
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,401
- So, you're excited to go back home?
- Definitely.

719
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,204
Mm-Hm.

720
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,440
I miss my mom, my little lady.

721
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:00,178
But I'm a little
scared to go home.

722
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,484
- Really?
- I don't know, this is the best I've ever been.

723
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:08,055
It's the longest I've been
sober. That's for sure.

724
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:11,325
But being here with you-

725
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:17,131
I don't know. Do you ever wish
you could just pause time?

726
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:22,236
Just stay in one moment for
a little while and just... just-

727
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:24,905
I don't know.

728
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:32,179
When I was in school I
wanted to go to prom so bad

729
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:36,715
but my parents were separated at the
time and my dad was being really strict

730
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,018
and wouldn't let me go.

731
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:43,989
But the cutest guy asked me to be his
date in front of the whole school.

732
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:48,193
- Yeah? What'd you do?
- Well, I couldn't say no.

733
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:52,166
So, I begged and begged
and finally he said okay.

734
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,368
And it took some convincing, but even
helped me buy a dress and everything.

735
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,335
Good man.

736
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:58,238
Yeah.

737
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,943
It was the most beautiful night

738
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,213
and I never wanted it to end,

739
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:15,055
but it did and the next day at school the boy
that asked me to prom wouldn't even talk to me.

740
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:19,326
- [JJ] What a jerk!
- [Sam] I know!

741
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:21,495
But

742
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,531
life isn't prom.

743
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,202
Life is going to
school the next day.

744
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,437
[scoffs]

745
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,240
Yeah, I guess so.

746
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:46,220
[Sam] So, do you mind me asking
how it all started for you?

747
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,189
- [JJ] What started?
- [Sam] Your addiction.

748
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:54,127
- I mean, if it's too personal, you don't have to...
- No, that's fine.

749
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:57,529
I learned to talk about it
a lot in rehab, you know.

750
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:58,565
Mm-Hm.

751
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,801
Actually it's fine that you're
talking about high school

752
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:03,301
because that's where
it all started for me.

753
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:04,804
- Really?
- Yeah.

754
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:06,505
Oh.

755
00:45:06,507 --> 00:45:09,409
I know it doesn't seem like it but I was
quite the football player back in the day.

756
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:11,409
- Were you?
- I was.

757
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:13,413
- Shocking!
- Whatever.

758
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:18,552
I was 16 and there
was a big game.

759
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:24,157
I was running down the sideline
and I got hit hard, seeing stars.

760
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:30,030
The next day, my back was hurting
so bad I couldn't even go to school.

761
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:36,501
Went to the doctor and not
really much they can do.

762
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:41,041
So, they handed me a couple of bottles
of pills, some Vicodin, some Oxy.

763
00:45:43,878 --> 00:45:46,046
At first, I just took
them when needed.

764
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:49,449
There was just one time my
back was hurting pretty bad.

765
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,219
I took a couple of extra

766
00:45:55,188 --> 00:45:56,456
and I felt amazing.

767
00:45:57,224 --> 00:46:01,161
Not a care in the world,
no stress, no anxiety.

768
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:03,965
It's like you're floating.

769
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:12,571
Not too long after that I found
myself trying to get hurt in games.

770
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:16,076
Hitting people as hard
as I possibly could.

771
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:20,512
Of course, the coach loved it and
everyone thought I was this great player,

772
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:22,647
but I was just
trying to get injured.

773
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,349
I just wanted to get more pills.

774
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,353
- And they would just give you more?
- Every time.

775
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:29,590
Every time.

776
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,227
That was ten years ago.

777
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,200
Those little pills stole
ten years of my life.

778
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:48,208
What made you wanna stop?

779
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:54,648
Lexi.

780
00:46:57,919 --> 00:46:59,620
I lost custody a while back.

781
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:03,156
I haven't seen her in...

782
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:06,393
I haven't seen her
in a long time.

783
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:12,232
But I'd do anything
for that little girl.

784
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,637
Well, then she's
lucky to have you.

785
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:21,341
[JJ] I don't know
about that, but

786
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,677
I know I'm lucky to have her.

787
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:26,546
She makes me want to be better.

788
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:31,618
You make me want
to be better, too.

789
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:43,595
- [JJ] How'd you sleep?
- [Sam] Good.

790
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:45,296
- Yeah?
- Yeah, how'd you sleep?

791
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:46,431
I slept great.

792
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:47,701
[JJ] How's the caramels?

793
00:47:48,502 --> 00:47:49,534
- [Sam] So good.
- [JJ] So good.

794
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:50,903
Yeah, so good.

795
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:53,438
- Are you ticklish? Are you ticklish there?
- Right there, yeah.

796
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,308
[Sam] Who isn't? Do
you want your Runyon?

797
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,443
- [JJ] What's a Runyon?
- [Sam] Means like a popular place to go hike.

798
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:00,445
[JJ] Oh, hiking. Okay.

799
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:03,450
Isn't it funny, how in life,

800
00:48:04,785 --> 00:48:10,390
you can go like your whole life without ever
talking to someone and then you meet them

801
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,594
and you can't imagine your life going
on without talking to them anymore?

802
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:20,434
It'd be weird like if I never talked
to you again from this point on.

803
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:31,010
- Oh my God! Who is this guy?
- It was terrible.

804
00:48:31,012 --> 00:48:32,444
Seems like a horrible friend.

805
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:35,647
It was so bad, I thought
I was going to die.

806
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:36,614
Hey give me your key.

807
00:48:36,616 --> 00:48:38,218
- Why?
- Just give it to me.

808
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,354
JJ.

809
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,227
[JJ] Yeah.

810
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:50,595
[Sam] Hey, look just give me
my key. Come on, let's go.

811
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:51,698
[JJ] All right.

812
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,753
- Hello.
- You're so pretty.

813
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:16,824
You are so pretty.

814
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:21,827
Okay, enough.

815
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:23,762
[JJ] I just found out we're
not getting married

816
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:25,497
- [Sam] Oh, man.
- [JJ] It kind of is breaking my heart.

817
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:27,267
At least it's been documented.

818
00:49:27,835 --> 00:49:30,435
- It's a good thing.
- Not now.

819
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:31,505
[laughing]

820
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:34,073
Okay.

821
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,676
All right, I'm actually full.
I don't need to eat that.

822
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:38,643
[mouthing]

823
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:40,781
- Do you wanna get a milkshake though?
- What?

824
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,715
- You want to get a milkshake?
- Yeah.

825
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:44,884
- Will you split it with me?
- I don't want milkshake.

826
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:46,118
- I'll watch you...
- No.

827
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,587
Have your milkshake.

828
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:49,422
Okay, fine.

829
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:52,827

830
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,857
Here we are, in Hollywood,
California.

831
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:30,662
In case you don't know, this is the very
site that they shot <i>Pretty Woman</i> right here.

832
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:32,764
- [Sam] What? Is it actually?
- [JJ] No.

833
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:34,800
[Sam laughing]

834
00:50:34,802 --> 00:50:36,035
- Wow.
- She looked out that window.

835
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:38,738
- Yeah, folks, it's the truth.
- And she said, big mistake.

836
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:41,140
- Huge.
- Huge.

837
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:42,540
Come with me.

- Ow! I really twisted my ankle.
- Really? Can we watch that? We got to watch this, hold on.

841
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:01,661
Guys, blow. Give me a spare.

What are you doing out here?

857
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,062

[Sam] You never told me
what's your greatest fear.

865
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,775
Once when I was a kid,

866
00:53:29,776 --> 00:53:31,912
I got mud on my
favorite shoes.

867
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:35,648
It was a rainy day

868
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:40,787
and I was playing with my
brothers out in the woods.

869
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:45,824
It was those shoes that had all
those squares and lines on the bottom

870
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:48,528
and it would have taken
forever to get it all out.

871
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:53,901
So, I went and found
my little brother.

872
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,137
He was pretty young at the time.

873
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:58,806
I thought I could
convince him to do it.

874
00:54:00,341 --> 00:54:04,644
I told him how he was good with sticks
and he had better focus than I did.

875
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:07,882
So, he agreed.

876
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:14,721
That kid sat there for over 40 minutes
picking out the mud out of my shoes.

877
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,694
Finally, he got tired of doing it and
he gave the shoes back to me, but he-

878
00:54:23,696 --> 00:54:25,132
he got a lot of it out.

879
00:54:34,975 --> 00:54:40,045
I'd always thought it was because I was
so good at convincing people of things

880
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:42,582
and that I could
manipulate situations.

881
00:54:51,724 --> 00:54:53,726
But now that I look
back, I realize,

882
00:54:56,397 --> 00:54:58,132
he's just a better
person than me.

883
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:07,041
I didn't convince him of anything. He just
felt bad and he wanted to help, you know?

people in this world.
