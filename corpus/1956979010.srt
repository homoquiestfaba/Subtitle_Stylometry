This is Maris 2 confirming

Suggest you inform
chief of operations.

Gotta be a security
check, captain.

going up against this baby.

Marker alarm doesn't
necessarily mean a problem.

a leak on a sensor.

Tomorrow morning, we will
board the passenger compartment

A time when the world was
frightened by toxic waste?

163
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,370
Well, that was way before
we here at North Hemi

164
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,640
proved that long term storage
of hazardous materials

165

completed the docking operation

Believe me, there's some happy
people over there right now.

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,830
That was no simulation.

Are you sure?

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,390
Yeah.

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,400
I still can't figure it out.

173
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,220
Was it real or was it simulated?

174
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,920
I don't know.

180
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,240
I didn't expect
you till morning.

181
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,010
Well, I caught an early
ride out with a tour group.

182
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,260
You really made it sound like
it was urgent, and you know me,

183
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm a journalist.

184
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,780
Shh.

185
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,170
Keep it quiet, will you?

186
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,210
I dunno what I'm
dealing with here.

187
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,870
Hey, are you all right?

188
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,690
You look like something's
really bugging you.

189
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,390
What is it?

190
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,240
Oh, some cowboy pretending
to be a robot pilot

191
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,740
had to pick this afternoon to
prove what an asshole he is!

192
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,690
Excuse me, miss.

193
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,070
Did you call me an asshole?

194
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,930
You broke my
specimens, you jerk off.

195
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,430
Oh, now I'm a jerkoff.

196
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,890
My grandmother could pilot
that robot better than you.

197
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,510
Are you suicidal or
just incompetent?

198
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,090
Are you busy tonight?

199
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,250
Excuse me?

200
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,190
Let's go to your place.

201
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,690
You know, mine's a mess.

202
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,550
You do have brain
damage, don't you?

203
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,050
And you have a
great set of lips.

204
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,910
And you've got a lot of
nerve, jeopardizing people's

205
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,680
lives for your own amusement!

206
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,360
You see, Stumpy?

207
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,290
This woman cannot
live without me.

208
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,810
I think you need to
be, you know, spanked.

209
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,540
And I think you
need an ice pack.

210
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,370
Come on, let's go.

211
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,730
Hey, Rocky, it
wasn't my fault.

212
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,510
Wow.

213
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,590
I like her.

214
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,800
She's got some pair of sweater
puppies under those coveralls.

215
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,970
Bite your tongue, Stumpy.

216
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,920
That hellcat's gonna
bear my children.

217
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,560
Well, I'm thinking you're
a little punchy, sir.

218
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,710
She doesn't even like you.

219
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,410
I'm thinking you're right.

220
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,230
That was no love tap, my friend.

221
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,570
Well, she's got a point.

222
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,970
We got no right dragging
tourists into a firefight.

223
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,240
What am I supposed to do,
Stumpy, ignore a direct order?

224
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,890
Those bastards at
OpCom want everyone

225
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,150
to think it's for show!

226
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,570
Well, she's no
dope, that lady.

227
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,000
Maybe she'll blow the
whistle to the press.

228
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,910
Yeah, I hope she does.

229
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,780
I've had it up to here.

230
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,910
Now, captain, don't--
now, don't start

231
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,740
saying you're gonna quit.

232
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,960
You're not gonna quit.

233
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,940
Yeah, I am.

234
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,710
This time, I am.

235
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,990
Put a fork in me, I'm done.

236
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,690
Again?

237
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,360
You like, Wally?

238
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,830
I like.

239
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,760
Well, you can arrange to
have the same buggy, gentlemen.

240
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,810
That big?

241
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,020
Well, half that size.

242
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,150
And without the assault
weapons, of course.

243
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,880
But it will be fully equipped
to protect your toxic zones.

244
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,630
As long as we have
limited weapon components.

245
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,810
You got it, Sing-Sing.

246
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,210
It's Wan-Sing.

247
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,140
Done deal.

248
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,460
Our alliance is a peaceful one.

249
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,900
Our borders are not in
dispute, as yours are.

250
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,310
Is that a crack, general?

251
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,710
What General Wa-Lee
is most interested in is

252
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,470
the entertainment aspects of--

253
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,790
Shut up, Sing-Sing.

254
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,850
I am most interested in the
entertainment aspects of

255
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,190
large robotic security systems.

256
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,750
Then I think you'll
like this news.

257
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,640
I've arranged for you to
travel aboard the Maris 2

258
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,370
to Crystal Vista before
you leave North Hemi.

259
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,900
That is good news.

260
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,450
I have authorized it
for you to ride up front,

261
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,670
behind the pilot in the cockpit.

262
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,730
Well, allow me to
return the honor.

263
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,560
Tonight, my officers
and I will conduct

264
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,230
a traditional Shim-Ku ceremony.

265
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,220
You and your officers and their
guests are welcome to observe.

266
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,120
Well, thank you, general.

267
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,970
That sounds very interesting.

268
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,980
Leda, you're asking me to
believe the whole ghost town's

269
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,500
a fake?

270
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,090
How did a town that was
supposedly abandoned in 1993

271
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,310
get built above a
layer of infrasorb 8.

272
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,610
Which wasn't even invented
until 20 years later.

273
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,010
You're absolutely
sure it's infrasorb 8?

274
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,810
Yeah.

275
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,810
And a foot thick in
every test hole I've dug.

276
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,890
Which means there's
something under Crystal Vista

277
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,580
they don't want satellite
pictures to reveal.

278
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,270
Look at these.

279
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,770
I mcorded them yesterday.

280
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,830
What is this supposed to be.

281
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,640
A secret tunnel.

282
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,800
I found it looking for an
old wall safe in the basement

283
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,500
of City Hall.

284
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,440
Come on, what would somebody
be hiding under a ghost town?

285
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,390
How about a huge
cache of weapons?

286
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,020
Weapons that were
supposed to have

287
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,790
been destroyed during
the Tri-World Arms

288
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,660
Reduction Treaty of 2021?

289
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,160
All you've got is infrasorb
8 and some photos of a tunnel.

290
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
No, no, wait a minute.

291
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
Take a look at this picture,
the old Mega-1 robot manual.

292
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,110
You know what this is?

293
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,430
Micron transponder?

294
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,790
Right.

295
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,280
I've been on this
for weeks, Annie.

296
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,080
I don't know.

297
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,430
Well, well, well.

298
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,880
I've got a little
present for you, chief.

299
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,160
Been to the ocean?
- What?

300
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,920
No.

301
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,380
Me neither.

302
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,870
This proves that the Centros
are firing on us with weapons

303
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,670
made by the Eastern Alliance.

304
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,680
That hunk of junk
doesn't prove anything.

305
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,430
Look at it!

306
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,110
You're too negative, Drake.

307
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,030
Now, that's your problem.

308
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,820
Am I?

309
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,040
Yes, way too negative.

310
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,980
You're a walking minus sign.

311
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,730
Rooney, you must have
grown up in old California

312
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,540
with too much sun.

313
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,550
Let me ask you a question.

314
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,120
Was your daddy rich and
your mama good-looking?

315
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,710
You're cruising for a
court martial, buster boy.

316
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,910
The Eastern Alliance
is on our side.

317
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,290
So they sell a few
weapons to the Centros.

318
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,080
We sell a few to them.

319
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,780
So what?

320
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,630
It's good business.

321
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,330
Stop the tours.

322
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,080
We're not gonna take
any crap from the Centros.

323
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,960
Stop the tours, please!

324
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,670
You still don't
get it, do you?

325
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,480
If we don't sell minimechs
to the Eastern Alliance,

326
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,400
then the North Hemi economy
is gonna go belly up.

327
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,720
Money, Drake.

328
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,200
We're talking money here.

329
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,900
Not we.

330
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,600
You.

331
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,550
You're talking about money.

332
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,180
I'm talking about
human beings, man.

334
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,580
Life?

335
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,900
Grow up, huh?

336
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,310
I don't understand how you got
a commission in the first place.

337
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,260
You don't have the
killer instinct.

338
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,910
Take a real long look at these
eyes and tell me what you see.

339
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,190
OK, all right.

340
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,430
Now, why don't you take a long
vacation and try new Chicago.

341
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,870
I understand it's nice and
windy this time of year.

342
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,650
You know, your little

their asses shot off out there.

344
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,490
Then where are you gonna be?

345
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,420
You're off the
pilot roster, mister.

346
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,590
The sooner, the better.

347
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,880
Dismissed!

348
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,830

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,990

He was cuter before
you popped him.

357
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,650
Shut up, Annie.

358
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,550
Have you met Annie?

359
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,730
Hello, Annie.

360
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,430
Hi.

361
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,520
Hi, handsome.

362
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,580
I'm Drake.

363
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,390
This here is my ace mechanic
Stumpy, the stumpman.

364
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,570
[GRUNTING]

365
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,130
[APPLAUSE]

366
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,210
Captain Drake,
would you care to go

367
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,660
toe-to-toe in little shim-ku?

368
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,630
Shall we dance?

369
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,040
No thank you, general.

370
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,540
My feet are killing me.

371
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,130
Poor excuse for the year 2041!

372
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,390
[LAUGHTER]

373
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,930
I hear the captain was a worthy
disciple of ancient arts.

374
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,880
It was an elective
at the Academy.

375
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,030
I got a C-.

376
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,980
You're too modest.

377
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,090
I demand you honor me
with [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

378
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,790
Please!

379
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,440
We'll meet again, Captain Drake.

380
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,530
Yeah, we'll do tea.

381
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,300
ANNIE: Oh, I wanna
get into his uniform.

382
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,410
Annie, please.

383
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,880
If he can talk, he's mine.

384
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,580
Stop.

385
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,090
You're gonna make
yourself crazy.

386
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,700
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen.

387
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,400
He's mine.

388
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,990
I'll be happy to
answer any questions you

389
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,520
have about megarobots as we make
our way toward our destination.

390
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,920
Please don't hesitate to ask.

391
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,620
I'm here to help.

392
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,230
You know what I think?

393
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,930
Hm?

394
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,820
I think you really missed
the boat with that Drake guy.

395
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,790
Annie.

396
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,750
Fine, OK.

397
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,720
Not another word.

398
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,170
Thank you.

399
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,180
Hey, folks, this is
your pilot, Captain Boles.

400
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,200
I just wanted to tell you
that we're right on schedule,

401
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
and we should be pulling into
beautiful downtown Crystal

402
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,030
Terminal in about one hour.

403
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,130
So why don't you just sit
back and enjoy the ride?

404
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,340
You really think
he's all right?

405
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,750
Who?

406
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,150
Drake.

407
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,230
I thought you didn't care.

408
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,930
I don't.

409
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,730
Girl, you got it bad.

410
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,360
OK, forget it, forget it.

411
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,160
Let's just concentrate
on the Crystal Vista, OK?

412
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,050
OK.

413
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,380
Mm-hm.

414
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,860
And we are not gonna come
back from here empty handed.

415
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,270
I'm gonna find that
micron transponder,

416
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,400
and you are gonna
get your story.

417
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,130
Capisce?

418
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,110
Uh-huh.

419
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,060
Uh-huh?

420
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,650
You got it real bad.

421
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,870
[LAUGHTER]

422
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,850
I guess the Centros are
taking a siesta today, sir.

423
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,560
Hold your tongue, mister.

424
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,570
My special ops are sweeping
a 40 mile corridor out there.

425
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,580
Let's give credit where
credit is due, huh?

426
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,410
What about General
Wa-Lee's request?

427
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,840
Oh, send him out
on the afternoon run.

428
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,180
Do you really think
that's a good idea

429
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,630
Yes I do.

430
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,910
I think it's a swell idea.

431
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,160
I think it's a capital idea.

432
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,490
If I didn't, I wouldn't have
suggested it, now, would I?

433
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,190
No, sir.

434
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,230
Don't think too
much, Pritchard.

435
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,290
It'll give you migraines.

436
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,530
Oh, one other thing.

437
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,670
General Wa-Lee's requested
Drake to be his pilot.

438
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,910
I don't think
that's possible, sir.

439
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,810
Well, are you thinking again?

440
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,050
No, sir.

441
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,890
Captain Drake, uh, volunteered
for the special ops mission

442
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,780
going out to the quarter.

443
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,210
That crazy flyboy is
out there playing cowboys

444
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,890
and Indians with the grunts?

445
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,560
Well, you know Drake, sir.

446
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,250
I hope he gets
his balls shot off.

447

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,750
What would John Wayne do?

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,720
Remember the Alamo!

Hey, hey.

453
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,640
Captain.

454
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,980
Captain, did you see the
whites of their eyes?

455
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,690
Why don't you get this
off me sometime today?

456
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,030
Here you go.

457
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,010
Well, at least you didn't
wreck the megarobot.

458
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,280
Are you saying
I'm a Sunday driver?

459
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,980
No, no.

460
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,680
No, no, skip.

461
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,880
This was clearly
a drive by shoot.

462
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,580
Yeah.

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,150
Brought some tequila.

464
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,190
It have a worm in it?

465
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,060
No.

466
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,460
Forget it.

467
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,970
I never drink the cheap stuff.

468
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,670
What the hell are the
Centros doing way out here?

469
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,480
Oh, my.

470
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,180
Oh, man.

471
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,760
Look at this.

472
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,340
Little present for
the boys at the lab.

473
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,330
That ought to give those
nerds a bionic boner.

474
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,930
Where's the rescue party?

475
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,880
Oh, man.

476
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,820
You're it, Stumpy.

477
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,150
My hero.

478
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,180
Don't get too close, captain.

479
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,500
You got a bit of
a smell about you.

480
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,770
How would you like to
take a nap under that junk?

481
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,470
No, no, Skip.

482
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,250
I'm claustrophobic.

483
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,470
I start hearing voices
and seeing things.

484
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,400
You know, lizards and funny
little colored creatures.

485
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,120
We're gonna get you a
good bottle of tequila

486
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,130
when we get back to operations.

487
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,430
I want you to lay off that
bug juice you've been tipping.

488
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,240
Do you hear me?

489
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,940
Huh?

490
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,460
Yeah.

491
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,900
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,300
You know, we're
robot men, captain.

493
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,130
What are we doing out here
in the grit and grime, where

494
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,540
people can blow our ass away?

495
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,960
We're supposed to
be indestructible.

496
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,660
No shit.

497
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,120
Thank you.

You may now exit the

Thank you, and have a pleasant
stay in Crystal vista.

505

Ladies and gentlemen, Maris
2 has completed to dock.

506
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,450
And if you'll please
follow me, we'll

507
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,780
proceed out the door, down
the ramp, into the elevator,

508
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,060
and to the terminal.

509
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,760
Thank you.

510
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't forget

511
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,630
your tour packs at the counter.

512
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,460
Ah, and at this time, I'd
like to introduce your Maris

513
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,310
2 pilot, Captain Will Boles.

514
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,940
Thank you, Lieutenant.

515
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,380
Well, I hope you'll
enjoy yourselves.

516
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,570
I think you'll
find Crystal Vista

517
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,560
to be both fascinating
and informative.

518
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,690
And I'll see you back here
tonight for our return home.

519
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,130
Have a good time.

520
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,310
The robot's not
waiting here for us?

521
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,010
Are you kidding?

522
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,300
They keep it going constantly.

523
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,990
No, they'll bring in a new
group when they pick us up.

524
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,620
You know, it just doesn't
make sense that North

525
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,460
Hemi's hiding weapons here.

526
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,200
If they were, they wouldn't
have all these tourists

527
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,900
coming and going.

528
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,480
I'm not asking you
to make sense of it.

529
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,630
Just look at what
I have to show you.

530
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,470
Ah, yes, Dr. Fanning and
her friend from the media.

531
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,200
Oh, I'm not here as
a journalist, exactly.

532
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
Just visiting my old friend.

533
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,830
Are you going to be
staying with the group

534
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,810
or going on your project
site, Dr. Fanning?

535
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,150
Uh, my project, but
we'll ride into town

536
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,960
with the rest of the
group, if that's all right.

537
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,590
That's fine.

538
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,970
well, here you are folks,
the last surviving example

539
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,120
of a typical Southwestern
community from the days

540
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,710
when the Southwest was actually
part of the United States.

541
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,620
Well, as people around here used
to say in those days, ladies

542
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,280
and gentlemen, have a nice day.

543

[CHATTERING]

545
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,630
Let's stick with the
group for a minute.

546
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,910
OK, but do you think
we have enough time?

547
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,610
Sure.

548
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,910
I didn't know the Centros
had anything like this.

549
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,310
What is it?

550
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,430
A satbound simulator.

551
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,180
It wouldn't be any
use to the Centros.

552
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,470
What do you mean?

553
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,820
Their satellites
don't use this type

554
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,530
of signal compression.

555
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,820
I'll have to run
some tests on it

556
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,920
before I can give you a guess as
to what they're doing with it.

557
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,870
All right, get right on it.

558
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,570
Hey, bud.

559
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,860
Yes, sir?

560
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,590
Where are those kind
of satbound simulators

561
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,670
manufactured?

562
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,440
Most of this stuff
comes out of Asia, sir.

563
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,200
Is this your idea of a
little R&amp;R, Drake, Stumpy?

564
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,120
Skimming the desert,
looking for Trouble

565
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,880
How far, chief?

566
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,680
We didn't look for them.

567
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,460
They found us.

568
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,740
This place is
jumping with Centros.

569
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,510
Well, a few rotten beans
aren't gonna ruin this barrel,

570
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,390
Drake.

571
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,440
Look, sir.

572
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,900
What?

573
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,870
Something smells out there.

574
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,570
STUMPY: Skip, Skip.

575
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,290
Shut up.

576
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,640
I don't wanna hear a word.

577
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,890
These Centros have got a bug
in the air about something,

578
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,910
and before we're up
to our necks in wax,

579
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,810
we gotta find out what it is!

580
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,080
You know, Drake,
you're beginning

581
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,420
to get on my last nerve.

582
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,630
If you send Wa-Lee and his
officers into that corridor,

583
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,370
they're gonna get whacked, dead.

584
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,160
Your mood shifts didn't
figure into my plans, Drake.

585
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,760
General We-Lee and his staff
are already aboard Maris 2

586
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
en route to Crystal Vista.

587
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,530
In fact, I would
imagine, right about now,

588
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,670
General Wa-Lee is having
the time of his life.

00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,650
Skip, Skip!

591
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,520
I think I owe you a drink.

592
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,600
Is this the strat-adjuster?

593
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,300
Yeah-- yes.

594
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,120
Yes, it is, general.

595
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,750
Why don't you hold on to
this control right here?

596
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,490
OpCom to Maris 2.

597
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,400
This is Chief Rooney.

598
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,950
Yes, OpCom, this is Maris 2.

599
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,260
General Wa-Lee,
can you hear me?

600
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,270
I'm right here, Chief
Rooney, having a great time.

601
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,390
Well, I'm glad to
hear that, general.

602
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,580
Captain Boles let
me drive the robot.

603
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,930
How am I doing?

604
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,020
ROONEY: I think you'd make
a fine robot pilot, sir.

605
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,730
I hope your officers
are enjoying their ride

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,290
in the passenger compartment.

607
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,310
Oh, they are.

608
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,280
Here, let me show you.

609
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,110

pretty quickly, general.

00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,570
Oh, I'm a big, big
fan of megarobots.

611
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,880
Well, I'll let you continue
with your fun, general.

612
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,340
You're in good hands
with Captain Boles.

613
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,750
Thank you, Chief Rooney.

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,110
Let me do it.

616
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,910
Yeah, you handle the robot
like a real pro, general.

617
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,640
I presume we're
going someplace

618
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,420
we're not supposed to.

619
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,370
OK, if we run into
a security guard,

620
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,840
we're looking for the
tour group, all right?

621
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,150
Let's start down
here, all right?

622
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,850
What's going on with the run?

623
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,620
Steady as she goes.

624
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,840
It's clear all the
way to Crystal Vista.

625
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,430
What's the ETA?

626
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,520
Should be docking
in about an hour.

old fashioned freeway.

They were supposed to
have been destroyed

was scrapped for salvage,
