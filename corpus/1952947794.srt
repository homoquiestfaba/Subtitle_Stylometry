00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,504
<i>Hold on 'cause I'm letting go</i>

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,116
<i>I'm gonna lasso your heart like a rodeo</i>

00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,947
<i>I'm gonna give you some
Till you want some more</i>

5
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,852
<i>'Cause all I see is an open door</i>

6
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:45,825
<i>And I see where it's leading me
All of this energy</i>

7
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:49,590
<i>Been bottled up way too long
It's powerful, powerful</i>

8
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:53,327
<i>You see what I'm getting at
I'm ready for all of that</i>

00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:57,030
<i>If I'm not a star, you're blind</i>

10
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:00,574
<i>I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair</i>

11
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:04,009
<i>I've got a one-way ticket
And I just got here</i>

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,877
<i>I'm gonna run this town

Ain't what my lipstick's for</i>

<i>I'm gonna run this town
Run this town</i>

17
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:26,258
<i>I'm gonna run this town
Run this town</i>

18
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:29,928
Where's breakfast?
I want waffles, spaghetti!

19
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:33,371
Spaghetti waffles! Whoo. Whoo!

20
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:35,568
Victor. Victor.
Please wait in the house, please.

21
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,846
My body is entering hunger shock.

22
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:44,914
Oh, bad news.
The cat pooped in the den.

23
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:48,387
Worse news, I used your blanket
to clean it up.

24
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,492
- We don't have a cat.
- No kidding.

25
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,156
Oh. L... Sorry.
I didn't think you'd be awake.

26
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,492
You have an appointment...

27
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,261
...with Guy Morgan,
I didn't think you'd wanna be late.

28
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:36,371
Oh, look at you thinking. Cute.

29
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,598
But I always have time for my portrait.

30
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,299
Look alive. Paint.

31
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,574
I'm feeling spiritually blocked.

32
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,576
Draw me a sesame seed bath.

33
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:46,140
Bath. Now.

34
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:48,981
Now, make momma look more beautiful
and thinner.

35
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:51,581
And make that water more quiet.

36
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,251
- Bev, you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

37
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,021
If I waited for you, I'd never be on time.

38
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,630
Lucky you never wait for me then.

39
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,545
Victor, no.

40
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,154
Uh, don't you want a glass?

41
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:32,318
Hmm. Earthy. A tad fishy.
Lovely gravel finish.

42
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,320
Did you let Victor put worms
in the blender again?

43
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,727
Yes. I mean, no.

44
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,827
I mean, it just happened.

45
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,736
You know nothing can kill me.

46
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,534
Nothing.

47
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:53,046
Step on it, Katie.
I cannot be late for this meeting.

48
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,581
Just run them over if you have to.

49
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:00,413
Hello? No, the kids don't need a library.

50
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,821
I am the dean, and the dean gets
what she wants, and I wanna remodel.

51
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,451
You're just boring. I'm being honest.
I don't know what else to tell you.

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,724
And I wanted my office done
for my meeting with Guy Morgan...

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,561
...the music mogul, but no.

54
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,930
And using Bollywood
as a theme for the dance?

55
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:18,562
That's totally un-American.
I don't care if it was my idea.

56
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,507
Hello.
Oh. Oh.

57
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,375
I'm Dean Van Ravensway,
and you must be...

58
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:28,642
- Guy Morgan.
- Ah, yes. Guy Morgan, a pleasure.

59
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,308
You look like a man who knows things.

60
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:33,046
Aha, even some things I shouldn't know.

61
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:35,019
- And I'm Luke.
Great.

62
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:52,530
<i>So tell me, Guy, is it true?
Are you the new judge on Idol?</i>

63
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,076
Well, let's just say
that Randy may be in the doghouse.

64
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,110
- Now, let's talk about my son.
- Of course.

65
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,715
- Have you reviewed your schedule, Luke?
- Yes, I have.

66
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,410
In fact, um, I'd like to add a music class.
Um, the music theory...

67
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:08,148
Wellesley has a great business program.
That's why we're here.

68
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:13,561
There are two types of people
in the music biz: Artists and businessmen.

69
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,561
- Luke is a businessman.
- Of course.

70
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:20,058
Katie, get in here. Look alive.
Make yourself useful.

71
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,871
Luke is gonna need a tour of the campus.

72
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:31,405
So text Bev and ask her
to escort Mr. Morgan around campus.

73
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:34,842
Now, Luke, if you are half as talented
a producer as your father...

74
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:38,078
The verdict's still out.
He hasn't earned it.

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,020
Heard the story of how I started
in the music business?

76
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,627
- Yes, everybody's heard it, Dad.
- Then everybody should know how it goes.

77
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,124
There I was,
working for The Rolling Stones...

78
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,130
...when Mick himself...
- Dad.

79
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:56,600
Fine. As I said,
the verdict is still out on my son.

80
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,539
He just produced an album
with the Fruity Dangers?

81
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,371
Do you mean Danger Fruit?

82
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,309
That record was amazing.

83
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,450
I forgot what they were called because
they made me absolutely no money.

84
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,420
Thank you. Rare I meet anyone
who's heard their album.

85
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:15,489
What, are you kidding?
They're a cult phenomenon.

86
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,319
I'm sorry. Why are you talking?

87
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:24,424
What I need is for Luke to learn
to spot a commercially viable star.

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,761
Image drives the bottom line, right?

89
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:30,303
I feel you. Would we have Bieber Fever
if he were an ugly troll?

90
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,634
Actually, he is a tad hobbit-like, isn't he?

91
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,175
I'd like Luke
to produce your Semester Showcase...

92
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:39,246
...to see if he can identify sellable talent.
- I produce the Semester Showcase.

93
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,476
I will double your Showcase budget.

94
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,351
I will invite every talent scout I know.

95
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,049
This could be the beginning
of a relationship...

96
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,192
...between Wellesley
and Kensington Records.

97
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,350
Looks like we have a new producer.

98
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:55,497
Oh, and this is my daughter, Bev.

99
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,696
Bev, this is the platinum-selling,
Grammy-winning...

100
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:01,769
...and very handsome producer,
Guy Morgan.

101
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,769
Could you give his son, Luke, a tour?

102
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,807
Sure. Would you like
to see the Wellesley perks?

103
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,604
Um, yes, brilliant. Sure.

104
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,070
- Katie.
I love your accent.

105
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,840
Katie.
Wanna come over tonight?

106
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,382
What are you still doing here? Go.

107
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:19,953
Guy and I have things we need to discuss.
Out. Now.

108
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:25,960
So, Guy, you've gotta tell me,
what was that like working under Mick?

109
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,532
Watch out.

110
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,031
- Dangerous balls.
- Ha, ha. Thanks.

111
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,637
- So you womanned up and did it?
Hey!

112
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,610
- Oh, I did it.
Hey!

113
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:48,147
- What happened?
Can we have our ball?

114
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:49,682
I didn't give my CD to Luke.

115
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,844
I snuck it in his dad's bag.

116
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:56,981
But Guy Morgan has your demo.
That's huge. What you need is a champion.

117
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,889
No, what I need is to graduate.

118
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,629
You giving our ball back or what?

119
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,426
Oh, do you want this?

120
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,504
She shoots, she scores.
Unlike you, soccer boy.

121
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:19,576
Oh, so spill it. Is Luke Morgan
as hot as everyone Tweets he is?

122
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,114
Hotter.

123
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:22,911
You should ask him to the dance.

124
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,315
Because I'm so forward with guys.

125
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,048
First time for everything, right?

126
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,893
- Hi, Luke.
- Hello.

127
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,294
You have to hear my demo.

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,828
It's a retro-funk-jazz explosion.

129
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:44,199
Back off. I was here first.

130
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,831
Hold on, hold up. Please hold on.
My boy does not want your demos yet.

131
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,274
Walk away. Move along. Bye.

132
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,813
It was nice chatting
or whatever that was.

133
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,415
- Yes, hi, I'm, uh...
- Luke Morgan, right?

134
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,110
Who is producing the Showcase.

135
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,188
I don't think I'm gonna do the Showcase,
so I need to keep a low profile...

136
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:04,793
Yeah, yeah. Listen close now.
There's two kinds of people in this school.

137
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,488
There are the wannabes
and there's gonnabes.

138
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:13,829
You and I, we're gonnabes. What do we do?
We stay away from the wannabes, all right?

139
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:17,564
And girls named Yolanda. There are three
of them and they are certifiably...

140
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,833
Crazy? You attract
crazy women? Shocking.

141
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,910
It may seem like I don't have game,
but ladies love a listener.

142
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,206
Plus, I'm telling you,
let me help you find acts.

143
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,407
- Ah, so you're a talent scout?
- Well, bottom line, I'm a DJ.

144
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,779
- Oh, you're a DJ as well?
- Check this.

145
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,590
Whoa.

146
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,857
Okay, yes. You could be very useful.
It was nice meeting you.

147
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,695
You got a girl for the dance?
Because I can hook you up.

148
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,029
Uh, no. Thanks.

149
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:51,605
Uh, but what do you know
about Bev Van Ravensway?

150
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:53,435
- Supposed to see her tonight.
- Bev?

151
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,633
- Yeah.
- She's hot...

152
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,278
...but the girl
is mad, mad drama, okay?

153
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,846
I am talking to you
and you don't even know my name.

154
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,916
- I'm Mickey O'Malley.
- Mickey O'Malley.

155
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,711
A rarity in the Irish community.

156
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,380
Om.

157
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,817
RAVl: Om.
- Om.

158
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:12,085
- Om.
- Om!

159
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,786
This is not a contest, Ms. Gail.

160
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,791
Just concentrate on your breathing.

161
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,461
My butt is numb.

162
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,999
If your butt is suffering,
then you are suffering.

163
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,630
In fact, your entire life is suffering. Why?

164
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,903
Because you crave
that which is meaningless.

165
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,070
Are you calling me shallow?

166
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:38,985
No, I'm saying to stop your craving
and release your butt.

167
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:42,716
Just release it. Release it, yeah.
Release that butt.

168
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:46,652
<i>Release that butt
Oh, yeah, release that butt</i>

169
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,423
<i>Oh, yeah, release that butt</i>

170
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:50,895
Mrs. Van Ravensway?

171
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,592
What part
of "if you interrupt my meditation...

172
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,966
...I will jerk your tail in a knot"
do you not understand?

173
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,573
You told me
to tell you when dinner was ready.

174
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,143
Oh, thank God.
I'm craving some bourbon.

175
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,383
Victor.

176
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:13,784
- Oh. Um, dinner's ready.
- Tell me something I don't know.

177
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,883
Do you have any idea how stressful it is
to run this academy?

178
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,709
Yes, I spent the money at the spa.

179
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,417
<i>Five thousand dollars a night
is not very expensive...</i>

180
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:53,153
<i>... when you think about the alternative,
which is me having a nervous breakdown.</i>

181
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,489
<i>Ow.</i>

182
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,100
<i>What are you doing?
I'm on the phone.</i>

183
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:01,861
<i>- I'm cleansing.
Heh, heh.</i>

184
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:04,301
Mac and cheese.

185
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:08,335
<i>I don't need your spiritual counseling.</i>

186
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,436
<i>I'm thinking of firing you.</i>

187
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,318
Pace yourself, Ms. Gail,
or you will not be one with everything.

188
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,821
Honey, that's what I got you for.
Now, make me one with everything.

189
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:27,423
This Showcase is giving me the vapors.

190
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,689
How did this become my life?

191
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,857
Did I ever tell you all about the time
I nearly got my big break?

192
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,525
Yes.
- Good.

193
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,136
Then you all know how it goes.

194
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,767
<i>I ain't gonna leap, I'm gonna jump</i>

195
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,273
<i>Find my way right out of this dump</i>

196
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:46,980
- I had talent, and they made me...
A laughingstock.

197
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,048
Now look at me.

198
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,710
I got two ungrateful kids...

199
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:55,880
...a dwarfish, hairy, elfin servant...

200
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,049
...and a random
tablecloth-wearing Asian...

201
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,457
- Indian.
- Who makes no sense at all, ever.

202
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,392
Why don't you have another drink, Mom.

203
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,128
Katie, napkin me.

204
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,793
I have got to impress Guy Morgan...

205
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,436
...so I can stop pretending to care
about this insufferable school...

206
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:16,374
...and we can all move to Hollywood where
no one pretends to care about anything.

207
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,174
Mom, I think that you're forgetting
about the most important thing. Me.

208
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,516
Guy will give me a deal
as soon as he hears me sing.

209
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:26,280
- I doubt that.
- No, I've been practicing really hard.

210
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:29,322
My voice teacher says
I've transcended to a whole new level.

211
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:30,516
Yeah, I doubt it.

212
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:33,253
When my first single drops,
I'll buy you that mansion...

213
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,363
...in the Hollywood Hills...

214
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,557
...and you can finally afford
to have your legs lengthened.

215
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,759
- Oh, ba...
- Ms. Gail.

216
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:42,904
- Miss Bev has clarity.
Katie.

217
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,096
- You see...
- Look.

218
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:48,141
- The lowly peasant tills the soil
for 40 years without any rain.

219
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,711
But the unemployed salesman
who has recently discovered hydroponics...

220
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,975
...all of a sudden gets disgusted by the...
- And see? No sense.

221
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,448
- That didn't make any sense.
- Let me finish. You...

222
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,554
Oh, I doubt it. You have me pray all day.

223
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,952
- I don't feel nothing.
- You don't have a soul.

224
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,321
No, you don't have soul.
- I have a many souls. I'll give you one.

225
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:09,760
- Where's your third eye? Turn that thing on.
- I have a fourth eye too. You wanna see it?

226
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,900
- What?
- Shh.

227
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:15,928
I wanna be 6'4". Wow me, Bev.

228
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:23,912
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do</i>

229
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
Just stop. Stop the wowing, okay?

230
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,908
What's wrong?
- Somehow you've gotten worse.

231
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,813
I don't know how that was possible...

232
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,614
...but there isn't enough Auto-Tune
that's gonna fix you.

233
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,122
- Well, Katie's bad playing threw me off.
- I don't think it was that.

234
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,920
Again.

235
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,652
Really? Okay.

236
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:46,461
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do</i>

237
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,761
Ouch.

238
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:50,997
I could belch the song better.

239
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,769
Have you been drinking
the floor wax again?

240
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,411
Anything to forget I live here.

241
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,480
Ugh. My head is buzzing
like a skeeter on a septic tank.

242
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,550
- Ravi, meditate me.
Good luck, buddy.

243
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,582
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I have my own plan.

244
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,160
Does it make me a bad person
that I kind of enjoyed that?

245
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,059
No.

246
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,529
Hmm. Nice work.

247
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:34,012
- Guess who's on his way over.
- Not now, Victor, I'm busy.

248
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,651
Guess or prepare to get creamed.

249
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,223
Victor! Victor! Victor, stop!

250
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,833
<i>I've got rings on my fingers</i>

251
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,098
<i>And glitter in my hair</i>

252
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:02,369
<i>I've got a one-way ticket
And I just got here</i>

253
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,875
<i>I'm gonna run...</i>

254
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,810
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Victor, what are you doing?

255
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,546
Victor!

256
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,948
Victor, where did you put my clothes?

257
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,282
- Surprise!
- What? No.

258
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,420
I'm gonna kill you. Victor!

259
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,498
Oh, hi, Katie.

260
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,072
You are evil. Let me in.

261
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,677
I control every lock on this property.

262
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:37,505
Crap.

263
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,611
This is insane.

264
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:46,846
Yeah, try the shed, it's unlocked, idiot.

265
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,725
You gotta be kidding me.

266
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,096
Crap.

267
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:09,002
How did such an untalented daughter
spring from my loins?

268
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:12,978
Focus, Ms. Gail. We are making
an offering to your personal deity.

269
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,275
Tell him to give me fame and fortune.

270
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,146
Not exactly how it works.

271
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,879
<i>Now, breathe through your Mula Bandha.</i>

272
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:23,115
Oh, honey, if I could do that,
I'd get a million hits on YouTube.

273
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,522
How much longer is this gonna take?
Ugh.

274
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,821
The prayer or the fame and fortune?

275
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,632
Ha, ha. See you later.

276
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,671
Victor.

277
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,945
Katie?

278
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,378
- Luke.
- Katie.

279
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:51,849
- Are you wearing a doormat?
- Yes.

280
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,784
- Welcome.
- Why, thank you.

281
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,655
The truth. Um...

282
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:02,294
My stepbrother locked me
outside of the house.

283
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:03,795
Naked.

284
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,131
Oh, sorry. You should...
You should take my jacket.

285
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,826
Oh.
- Oh, no, no.

286
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,365
There.

287
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,738
- Thanks. Now the pants.
- Hmm?

288
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,976
I'm kidding.

289
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,349
- You got me.
- Ha, ha.

290
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,710
No, no.

291
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:29,289
One more parent-teacher conference,
I swear I'm gonna lose it.

292
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,653
Look at me. I'm an educator.

293
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:36,925
I have no real skills. And I will die
before I go back to my daddy's farm.

294
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:41,232
You tell my personal deity
to help me achieve Guy Morgan. Do it.

295
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,997
I'll put another banana on the altar.

296
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,537
What is that?

297
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,376
Do you hear angels singing?

298
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,516
Perhaps the gods
have answered your prayer.

299
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,446
Hey. What...?

300
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,790
<i>- This is Gail Van Ravensway.
Hello.</i>

301
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,595
Guy Morgan here. How are you?

302
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,897
Oh, well, hello, Guy.

303
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,336
What a surprise
to see you calling this number.

304
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:20,532
Do you hear this?

305
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,370
<i>I can justify</i>

306
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,239
That's the demo your girl, Katie...

307
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,745
<i>... slipped into my briefcase.</i>

308
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,110
And it sounds like money, dear.

309
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,149
She gave you a CD?

310
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,687
Oh, well. Well, ain't that the berries.

311
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,792
Ravi, what frigging god did you pray to?

312
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:45,125
Guy, yeah, it seems someone's
not being entirely honest here.

313
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,297
Katie, somebody get that door!

314
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,997
So...

315
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,002
...that meeting today...

316
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,975
...it was obvious
that your dad doesn't get you.

317
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:00,372
He's an idiot for not liking your music.

318
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,983
Well, it's... It's complicated.

319
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:04,446
I'm gonna just, uh...

320
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,821
Is it as complicated as me...

321
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,118
...getting stuck outside
in only a welcome mat?

322
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:15,124
That's not complicated.
That is a gift from God.

323
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,833
Luke. Katie. What are you doing?

324
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:26,065
Well, it seems your brother
is Satan's very own personal Mini-Me.

325
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,505
Oh, I know, tell me about it. Come on in.

326
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,142
Oh, my God, did you work out today?

327
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,114
- Sit down.
- Ooh, look at this.

328
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:40,380
- Ha, ha. Some lemonade.
- Why, thank you.

329
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:43,023
You know, my stepsister,
she has body issues...

330
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,352
...so I don't like
to discourage her nudity.

331
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:46,721
That's interesting.

332
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,659
- She's absolutely lovely...
- Would you like an appetizer?

333
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,059
<i>Oh, fromage.</i>

334
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,860
I only have cheese.

335
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,006
I just got off the phone
with Guy Morgan.

336
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,073
Your phone.

337
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:05,978
He just loved that little demo
you left him.

338
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:07,706
I have underestimated you.

339
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,114
It'd make me proud
if I cared about you.

340
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,379
- I didn't lie about anything.
- Oh, but, chicken, you did.

341
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,183
At least that's what Guy thinks,
now that I've clarified.

342
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,556
I told him it was Bev's demo
and that you stole it from her.

343
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,994
- But you can't do that. That's my song.
- It's Bev's song.

344
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,602
And Guy can't wait to see her perform it
at the Showcase.

345
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:30,897
If you try to contact him, I'll deny
everything and lock you in the basement.

346
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:36,204
- She can't sing to save her life.
- No, but you can, can't you?

347
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,640
Now, let's hear this amazing voice.

348
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:49,683
<i>Like a malignant tumor
She's got no sense of humor</i>

349
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:53,954
<i>Just like a swollen blister
It's best to just resist her</i>

350
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:57,895
<i>She's not exactly a witch
She's just a terrible bi...</i>

351
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,028
Well, your lyrics stink.

352
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,363
But Guy's right, you've got chops.

353
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:08,303
Do you know what other instruments
I'm good at?

354
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:12,335
I have a feeling I could get in trouble
with a question like that.

355
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,749
I like trouble.

356
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:17,410
Hey, kids.

357
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,156
- Good evening, Miss Van Ravensway.
- Sorry, I need you to go. Now.

358
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:25,088
Family emergency. I need Bev
to help me pass a kidney stone.

359
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,094
- So she had a lovely evening. Ta-ta.
- Are you trying to ruin my life?

360
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:34,631
I have figured out a way for you
to wow Guy Morgan in the Showcase.

361
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:37,304
- So you do think I've improved?
- Oh, no, honey.

362
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,132
But my month of spiritual devotion
has taught me...

363
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,276
...that God works in annoying ways.

364
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,504
How am I to wow Guy Morgan
if I supposedly can't sing?

365
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,740
You can't, but Katie can.

366
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,613
- What?
- I know. Like I said, annoying.

367
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,086
We'll record her voice
and you will lip synch.

368
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:57,088
What if I don't want to?

369
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:01,924
Don't you get snarky with me,
you ungrateful toad.

370
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,156
- I saved your life.
- You didn't do anything.

371
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:06,596
- My dad married you.
- Yeah, and then he died.

372
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:10,329
I tried to put you in foster care,
but they was all fulled up on ugly.

373
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:11,995
- Funny.
- I thought it was...

374
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,641
...because you don't wanna look bad.

375
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,370
Katie, if you don't sing...

376
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:20,674
...I'm gonna find a way for that savings
your dad left to disappear.

377
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,281
That means, you forget college,
moving out, you're stuck here with me.

378
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:29,288
But, pumpkin, we're gonna have
so much fun growing old together.

379
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,359
Why don't you just have her perform
if you like her so much?

380
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,791
Because, honey, look at you.

381
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:37,090
You are a star.

382
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:41,463
That is what Guy Morgan needs.
You, the star.

383
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:43,194
I'm a star.

384
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:47,535
- A bright, gassy star.
- Yes, you are.

385
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,109
And Guy Morgan is gonna
give you a swimming pool...

386
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,246
...shaped just like Colin Farrell.

387
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:53,972
Every part of him.

388
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:57,676
Or, Bev, you could just see every part
of Colin Farrell on the Internet.

389
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,617
And just leave me out of this.

390
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,450
- Okay, so how do we do this?
- First rule of Lie Club...

391
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:06,526
...is don't talk about Lie Club.

392
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,029
Which includes you, Katie.

393
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,893
As far as everyone knows,
you can't sing.

394
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,126
And no more talking to Luke or Guy.

395
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:15,667
Are we clear?

396
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,298
Crystal.

397
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:22,233
Yeah, Dad, we're about to meet
some fresh talent right now.

398
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,403
Remember when you signed Jay-Z?
No, you passed on him, my bad.

399
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,049
Um, this is like that,
except it's gonna be brilliant.

400
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,548
Yeah. Okay.

401
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,846
- Yeah, okay. Bye.
- Dude, what'd he say?

402
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,545
These guys you told me about are good?

403
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,090
Yes. The Oral Majority has potential.
They'll be here any second.

404
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,956
Talking about potential,
how was your little date with Bev?

405
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,393
- Her mom kicked me out.
- I told you. Bev is drama.

406
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,123
Technically, it was Gail's drama.

407
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,427
But Bev's interesting, man. She's...

408
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,069
I'm worried she's bonkers.

409
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,070
See, my last girlfriend, she was hot,
but absolutely mental.

410
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,902
I need a girl who's not gonna be
shipped to the loony bin.

411
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,839
Hang on, I'm gonna hit the facilities.

412
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:58,707
Facilities. That's a new one.

413
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,843
- Hey, man. Sorry we're late.
- Hey, what's good, y'all?

414
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,747
Nobody talks to my boy
until he comes from the facilities.

415
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,114
We're here to impress.

416
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:08,552
- Clear, right?
- Got it.

417
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,862
<i>When you're fighting just to keep it sane</i>

418
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,294
<i>Throw your will
At the eye of the hurricane</i>

419
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,660
<i>- Sing it out
- Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh</i>

420
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:23,201
<i>- Help me sing it out
- Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh</i>

421
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:25,896
<i>If you wanna find out who you are
Stop running</i>

422
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:29,339
<i>In the end you'll figure out
It's all about nothing</i>

423
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:34,813
<i>All night, it's gonna be all right
Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

424
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:41,718
<i>All right
Turn your dreams into your life</i>

425
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:44,414
That's good.

426
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,765
I'm clean. No one followed me.
And I got your intel.

427
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:57,936
Oh, Katie, baby, your life sucks.

428
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:00,006
Trust me, it gets worse.

429
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:04,637
Okay, dude, those guys, they
just went Oral Majority on me in there...

430
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,008
- I was trying to hold them back...
- You're right.

431
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,116
They have potential and they're great.

432
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:14,517
But first, my talent-finding friend,
promise me no more auditions in the bogs.

433
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,884
- The what?
- The loo.

434
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,188
- Bathroom. Toilet.
- Got it.

435
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,955
All right. Okay, come on.
I wanna show you something.

436
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:25,863
So now I have to rehearse in secret.

437
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,501
Why not not rehearse?

438
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,694
Make Bev sound bad. What do you care?

439
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:32,863
No song, no savings account. No life.

440
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:37,477
People. Coming. Now.

441
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,847
Okay.

442
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:45,784
Dude, what are we doing?
The suspense is killing me.

443
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,884
Can you grab the mike?

444
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,047
Not about to serenade
a brother, are you?

445
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:52,056
Dude, with bromance, comes a fine line.

446
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,525
That I shall not cross.

447
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,294
So sing something.

448
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,434
Okay.

449
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,370
<i>I'm lost in a world
That rattles my brain</i>

450
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,033
<i>I'm cleaning up my life
From the mess you made</i>

451
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,610
<i>Oh, oh</i>

452
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,071
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

453
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,352
<i>My soul's in debt, but my bills are paid</i>

454
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,045
<i>I'd give anything just to make an escape</i>

455
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,814
<i>Oh, oh</i>

456
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,952
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh</i>

457
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,895
<i>So you can keep
Knocking, knocking, knocking</i>

458
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,396
<i>Baby, you're rockin'
But there ain't no way I'm ever letting you in</i>

459
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,033
<i>He's amazing.</i>

460
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,097
<i>Not again</i>

461
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,871
<i>So keep on
Knocking, knocking, knocking</i>

462
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:45,240
<i>But, baby, you're better off walking
'Cause I ain't gonna let you in</i>

463
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,971
<i>Never again</i>

464
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,677
<i>I went out on a limb again</i>

465
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:53,412
<i>I guess I had to lose to win</i>

466
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:57,957
<i>I was too confused to know
Which way to turn</i>

467
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:02,023
<i>- And she could be a millionaire...
- Crap.</i>

468
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:04,461
<i>- Gail needs me to drive her home.
- I don't care</i>

469
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:07,294
<i>'Cause, baby, there's nobody home</i>

470
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,960
<i>Nobody's home at all, yeah</i>

471
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,569
- What? Did you write that?
- Yeah.

472
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,373
Reminds me of, um... Uh...

473
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:22,880
- Danger Fruit, right? Danger Fruit.
- Ha, ha. Because I wrote their album too.

474
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,642
Shut up. Took me forever
to find that bootleg online.

475
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,811
- I love that album. That's crazy.
- Yeah.

476
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:30,287
My dad doesn't know.
And he thought the record...

477
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,153
...was a pile of crap.

478
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,122
He thinks writing's a waste of time.

479
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:38,396
Because he basically wants me
to be like him. Only with better hair.

480
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:42,963
But the first thing I thought when
I heard those guys in the urinals was...

481
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,162
...good acoustics.

482
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:48,406
Second thought was these guys,
these guys could be great.

483
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:50,168
If you gave them your song.

484
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,240
Mate, that's a brilliant idea.

485
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,678
- So put them in the Showcase?
- Put them in the Showcase.

486
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,182
Yeah.

487
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:06,384
<i>You can never tell where this might go</i>

488
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:07,991
You wrote that song today?

489
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,621
- You've been home for what, two hours?
- It's like an answer to his song.

490
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,197
You really like this guy.

491
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:15,063
Yeah, I'm an idiot.

492
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:17,431
You have to sing that for him.

493
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:21,097
What if you sang to him in secret?

494
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:25,709
At the dance. Ta-da.

495
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:32,150
Okay, I know the card's
like, really cheesy, but...

496
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,657
Oh, God, I hope you like it.

497
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:40,483
Ange, it's beautiful,
but are you crazy?

498
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,687
No, I know you're crazy.

499
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,888
Am not.

500
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,925
- What if he doesn't even like me?
- You'll both be in disguise.

501
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:50,798
It's your chance to see
if he was really flirting with you.

502
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:53,532
I was naked. Of course he was flirting.

503
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,404
And why even torture myself?
It's not like I can have him.

504
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:58,512
Why not? Tell him how you feel.

505
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,707
If he feels the same way, you can reveal
your hot self and he won't tell Gail.

506
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:06,178
And if he hates the song,
leave the disguise on.

507
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:10,647
Okay.

508
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,551
I'm going to the dance.

509
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,058
That's my girl.

510
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:18,322
<i>Maurice, no, no.
Again, in Français, longer legs.</i>

511
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,799
I wouldn't go in your closet
for a little while if I were you.

512
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,733
What? Why?

513
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,270
Hey. Wake up.

514
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:30,735
Katie!

515
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,348
The cat has pooped in my closet.
I need you to clean it up.

516
00:30:34,516 --> 00:30:36,006
Go.

517
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:37,913
I told you we don't have a cat.

518
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,417
Angie, heads up.

519
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:42,686
Katie!

520
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,625
What's going on?

521
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,230
Nothing.

522
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,527
I am, uh, re-organizing and labeling. I...

523
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:57,000
I took up crochet.
Do you want new socks?

524
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:01,232
I would make you a sweater, but I hear
that the arms, that they're really hard.

525
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:08,643
Oh, you thought you could sneak off
and go to the dance.

526
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:11,046
After what you pulled today with Guy.

527
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,652
Oh, no, no.

528
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,311
Oh, no, no, no.

529
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,788
You're on Victor watch tonight...

530
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,655
...tomorrow night and every night.

531
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:21,852
Fun.

532
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,158
I'll give Victor all the mothering
you don't have time for.

533
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,734
Oh, I wish you could be my mommy.

534
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,629
I'm off to my cinnamon colonic.

535
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,976
Hey. Get down.
You're gonna break yourself.

536
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,577
Or worse, the furniture.

537
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:43,976
Hello?
- Hey.

538
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:47,415
- You look like you're having fun.
- Always.

539
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:50,815
Well, I couldn't let you not go to the dance
without me.

540
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,392
Besides, we have six hours
of shirtless Team Jacob.

541
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:56,496
So let's just get this party started.

542
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:00,691
- So is Victor driving you nuts?
- I swear to you, he's not human.

543
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:04,268
I mean, can you really blame him, though?
Just look at this family.

544
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:06,770
Victor, what are you doing?

545
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:19,015
Oh, no. Great.

546
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,382
Eh, she actually looks prettier
that way.

547
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,016
True. Ugh. Whatever.

548
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,322
Why did I ever think that tonight
could've been something special.

549
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,362
Think Bev's all over Luke at the dance
right now?

550
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,831
They're probably making out. See?

551
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:38,200
- Victor, give it a rest.
- Just check it out. Come on.

552
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:44,037
<i>Luke is gonna produce
whoever wins the Showcase.</i>

553
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,272
<i>So we need a little insurance.</i>

554
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,645
<i>- I know what I'm doing, Mother.
Do you?</i>

555
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,419
I can't take it anymore, okay?

556
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:56,648
I'm taking my life into my own hands.

557
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:57,916
I'm talking to Luke.

558
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:01,017
- Finally.
- Okay, but we have gotta be home...

559
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:02,662
...before Gail gets here.

560
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,729
What about the demon spawn?

561
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,923
Mm-hm.

562
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,499
Right.

563
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:09,902
Okay, just watch him.

564
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,236
Hmm.

565
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:21,038
Is that all you've got, Angela?

566
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:22,740
Ravi?

567
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,944
My sister could catch that, jerknut.

568
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:29,555
Put some nuts in that sack, ref.

569
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,253
Miss Katie, I am most startled.

570
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,623
Obviously.

571
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,655
All right. All right. Don't hate me.

572
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,391
Okay, don't hate me. I'm sorry.

573
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:43,935
But my name ain't Ravi. It's Tony.

574
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:47,600
- Tony.
- Tony Gupta from Jersey.

575
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,437
- From Jersey.
- I am half Indian.

576
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:54,213
My friends call me Meatball
because I'm half Italian.

577
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,247
Truth is I always wanted to be an actor.

578
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,141
But I never got my shot.

579
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,549
I'm working at KFC,
and one day, Gail comes in...

580
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,122
...she's like, "Are you Indian?"
I'm like, "What?"

581
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,486
She's like, "Are you a guru?"
I'm like:

582
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,150
"Who is asking?"

583
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:10,795
She says, "Someone
who's paying for some spiritual guidance."

584
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,559
And I'm like, "Whaa! It's a miracle!"

585
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:18,104
I finally get a chance to do
a total immersion into a character.

586
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,670
Real training and I get paid.
Are you kidding me?

587
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:23,242
Ravi is my King Lear.

588
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:26,206
<i>You wanna hear
the monologue from My Fair Lady?</i>

589
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,574
- Oy, mate.
- No, thanks.

590
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,479
I'm sorry I barged in. Whoops.

591
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:37,951
Your secret's safe with me, okay?
But I need to ask you a favor.

592
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:40,685
- Meatball.
- Ha, Meatball.

593
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,330
Please watch Victor tonight
so I can go to the dance?

594
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,556
Are you kidding me? Done.

595
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:47,465
Blow it up.

596
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:50,961
Thank you.

597
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:02,181
Whoa.

598
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,978
How am I supposed to find Luke
if everybody's got a mask?

599
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:08,213
I never said this was
gonna be easy. Let's do some recon.

600
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,922
I am Assistant Principal
Dorothy Plumberg.

601
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:15,324
No drinking. No texting. No kissing.

602
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,001
Luke? No. Luke Morgan?

603
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:24,798
No leaving the premises
and no experiencing joy of any kind.

604
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,838
Luke? Ugh.

605
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,647
Where is he?

606
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:38,281
That reminds me.
I got a new act for you to listen to.

607
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:40,113
- Now?
- No time like it.

608
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:42,722
- Dude, not again...
- We're called Big Pain Ticket.

609
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,788
<i>I wanna kiss your apocalypse</i>

610
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:53,297
<i>Wrap you in my Armageddon</i>

611
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,662
<i>Sing you a twisted serenade</i>

612
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,600
They're good, but I'm worried
that chain saw's unsafe.

613
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:01,207
Dude, the chain saw's,
like, the best part.

614
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,073
I think I found him.

615
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,514
Well, he is blond.

616
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,920
Oh, my God, what is she doing here?

617
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:21,124
I hate teenage desperation.

618
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:22,694
What are you doing here?

619
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:25,697
Oh, honey, the prize pig
doesn't win the blue ribbon...

620
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,892
...by covering up its third best asset.

621
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:31,004
A, what does that even mean
and, B, did you just call me a pig?

622
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,003
Honey, I saw you making sweet love...

623
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:35,642
...to a plate of Swedish meatballs
at the snack table.

624
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,206
It's now or never, babe.

625
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:45,185
- What if she recognizes me?
- I'll distract her. Go.

626
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,548
- So was I right or was I right?
- You were right.

627
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:50,589
You have very cool taste.
Any more auditions in the men's...

628
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,692
...and you're fired.

629
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,257
- I know your secret.
- Which secret is that?

630
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,359
I heard you sing at school.

631
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:04,730
You were amazing.

632
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:05,964
Do I know you?

633
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,905
- I wanna show you something.
- What's your name?

634
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:17,308
Angela, what are you doing?

635
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,443
I'd like to make a request.

636
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:27,792
I will make your night. I promise.

637
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,327
Miss Van R.

638
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:32,364
Is it true you wanted to be a dancer
when you were younger...

639
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,727
...but were never good enough?

640
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:36,763
Who told you that?

641
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:55,921
Well, now, how lovely.

642
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,287
But I've seen better dancing
in a Filipino prison, sugar.

643
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,586
Oh!

644
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:04,993
Really? Because I think
I just challenged you to a dance battle.

645
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:12,431
Would Luke Morgan please pick up
the white courtesy phone?

646
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,507
Luke Morgan, white courtesy phone.

647
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:23,011
Hold on. What is that?
You've never seen a guitar before?

648
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,047
You hid a guitar in there.
You hiding anything else?

649
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,482
Follow me.

650
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:34,357
Oh, wow.

651
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:42,394
Madam, while your exquisite eyes
tell of a radiant, but mischievous beauty...

652
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,170
...I have grown impatient.

653
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:49,036
Off with your veil,
so that I may know the truth.

654
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:51,738
Or not.

655
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:57,041
I'm hoping this answers
a lot of your questions.

656
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,818
<i>I can see it from the spark in your eyes</i>

657
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:12,361
<i>You believe in all the things
You've denied</i>

658
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:16,060
<i>You wanna fly
And leave your worries behind</i>

659
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:20,230
<i>Don't you? Don't you?</i>

660
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,542
<i>Well, now I'm knocking
At your front door</i>

661
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:31,011
<i>And I'm looking for the right cure</i>

662
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:35,382
<i>I'm still a little bit unsure</i>

663
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:38,689
Okay, now take off that veil.

664
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,252
Uh-uh.

665
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,780
I think I've blown something.

666
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,016
Does anyone else smell cinnamon?

667
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,186
Move it, fatso.

668
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:37,530
<i>You can never tell where this might go</i>

669
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:41,901
Okay, you are blowing my mind.
You have to show me who you are.

670
00:42:54,455 --> 00:42:55,888
- We have to go.
- What?

671
00:42:56,056 --> 00:42:58,081
- Come.
- No, Ange.

672
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:00,819
In the middle of a really big moment
right now.

673
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,963
Someone had an accident
and went home.

674
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:06,797
I'm so sorry.

675
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,729
What...? You...?

676
00:43:09,436 --> 00:43:11,097
Hey. Wait.

677
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,500
But who are you?

678
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,267
Over here. Go, go, go.

679
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:26,443
- We beat her.
- I love you for this.

680
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,930
Interesting babysitting attire.

681
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,643
I should've known
you'd go behind my back again.

682
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:54,013
And that Paula Abdul wannabe,
trying to distract me.

683
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:56,543
Don't talk about her like that.

684
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,715
Your friend wants to be a choreographer,
if memory serves.

685
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,450
She might've made a decent one
if she hadn't gotten herself expelled.

686
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:07,890
Guess she can kiss
them Juilliard dreams goodbye.

687
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,122
Look, I'll do whatever you want.
Okay? Just leave Ange out of this.

688
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:14,560
That depends if you pull another stunt
like tonight, sugar.

689
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:18,597
- I won't.
- I'll be taking this.

690
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:28,343
Only her eyes were piercing out
through this veil, but her voice...

691
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:30,574
How hot was the girl
on a scale of one to 10?

692
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,685
- An 11.
- The hotness scale only goes 10.

693
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:34,548
Yeah, this girl has love potential.

694
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:37,020
- Ooh, love.
- Shut it.

695
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:42,522
We are gonna do this for hours
until we get it right. Even if it takes hours.

696
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:47,092
Now, sing like your life depends on it.
Because, sugar, it does.

697
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:49,795
We're recording.

698
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,935
<i>Plug in the mike</i>

699
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,334
<i>Open the curtain</i>

700
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,875
<i>Turn on the lights</i>

701
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,772
<i>I'm through rehearsing</i>

702
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,277
- Dang, she's good, man.
- Told you, man.

703
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,675
Check this out, all right?

704
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:05,444
Thirty-nine girls in the singing program
which means 85 percent...

705
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,450
...have music during the sixth period.

706
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,452
So your girl's in one of those rooms.

707
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:11,681
<i>The feeling ignites</i>

708
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:13,019
<i>I'm in control</i>

709
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:15,161
Oh, cut. Cut.

710
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:17,194
That was subpar at best.

711
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:19,889
From the top, pretty please.

712
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,933
<i>Amazing grace</i>

713
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:25,662
It's cool, I got this.

714
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,205
Ladies, all my single ladies.

715
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,401
My boy Luke here has a special favor
to ask of you, all right?

716
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:34,672
He needs vocals
for this big show coming up, so...

717
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:36,406
- My name is...
- Luke Morgan.

718
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,717
You will put me in the Showcase.
Oh, yes, you will.

719
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:43,815
- Maybe I could ask you to sing first?
- I am so gonna rock your world.

720
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:47,424
<i>I love the way you love me, Luke</i>

721
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:50,188
<i>Inside my head every night</i>

722
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:52,832
<i>You come and kiss me good night</i>

723
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,094
<i>Whatever you see is what you get</i>

724
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,795
Why don't you not suck
and do it again, okay?

725
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:05,137
<i>I wanna be with you forever...</i>

726
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:08,281
What is going on in here? Disgusting.

727
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,282
You two boys are not in my class.
Stop. Wait.

728
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:20,521
Stop. Wait. Stop.

729
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:41,944
<i>I got nothing to lose</i>

730
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:43,309
<i>I've been exposed</i>

731
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:45,782
<i>I'm paying my dues</i>

732
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:47,318
<i>Playing the role</i>

733
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:50,282
- Oh, really?
- We are back where we started.

734
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:51,583
This is not good.

735
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,957
That's her. That's her voice.

736
00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:56,959
Don't think you can get away from me.

737
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,530
- Step aside. Step aside.
- Please. Wait.

738
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,136
Okay. But first, why don't you
just both audition for me.

739
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:04,327
Listen...

740
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:07,941
<i>Luke, you are the one for me, yes you are</i>

741
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:09,769
<i>You just don't know it yet</i>

742
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:25,615
<i>Make you believe in me</i>

743
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:28,784
<i>I can be what you want me to be</i>

744
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:32,591
<i>Tonight is the night
Where I make you see</i>

745
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,702
<i>That I can be
Anything, anything, anything</i>

746
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:40,670
<i>I'll make you believe in me</i>

747
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:44,109
<i>I can be what you want me to be</i>

748
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,338
<i>Tonight is the night
Where I make you see</i>

749
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:51,083
It was you?

750
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:54,846
- Oh, sorry to interrupt.
- Oh, no, honey. Interrupt away.

751
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,623
I didn't think I'd see you. It was killing me.
Because I felt like we connected.

752
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:04,287
Excuse me.
Uh, how exactly did you two connect?

753
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,228
Yeah, how did we? I mean, we did.

754
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:09,528
- Through...
- With your lyrics. They just...

755
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,900
- I can't get them out of my head.
- My lyrics. Yeah.

756
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:14,936
Well, how wonderful.

757
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:18,475
But, uh, Bev has to prepare
for her Showcase audition.

758
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,909
Oh, no. She doesn't need to audition.
You're in.

759
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:24,213
Do you wanna grab a bite later?

760
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:25,476
- Yeah.
Wait.

761
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,887
You have a date with detention.

762
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:29,522
Actually, he has a date with me.

763
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,419
Dear me, did I not fire you?

764
00:48:31,592 --> 00:48:34,288
- I have tenure.
- One call and you're wearing a paper hat...

765
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:37,589
...that says "Welcome to McDonald's.
How may I take your order?"

766
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:39,254
- Five calls.
- Two calls and text.

767
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:41,333
Two calls, a text, several long e-mails.

768
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,299
One text and a Tweet.
- One text and a re-Tweet.

769
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:46,837
Oh, for God's sakes,
go lick a chalkboard.

770
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,474
Fine.

771
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:50,800
I hate you.

772
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:58,578
Okay. Um, I'd love to write a song with you.
Let's talk about it tonight?

773
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,786
- I'd love to.
- Okay, you're on.

774
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,988
I've always wanted to write a song.

775
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:12,359
Maybe I'll write about my skin.
They say love tightens your pores.

776
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,999
What rhymes with pores?

777
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,965
Chores. Bores. Sores.

778
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:19,332
Katie, I've got a new task for you.

779
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:21,701
Crushing disappointment.

780
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,641
You are gonna write a song for Bev
to say she wrote for Luke.

781
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:27,880
A song
about what a good kisser Luke is.

782
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,982
We can't just give him a song.

783
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,278
He wants to write it with you
and you know nothing about music.

784
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:35,948
Katie, I'm sorry to say...

785
00:49:36,123 --> 00:49:38,683
...but Bev's gonna need some help
keeping your man.

786
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:39,985
Well, I mean, her man.

787
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:57,186
Oh, and that silky smooth sound
you hit on the high notes, that is just...

788
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,557
It is the sexiest thing I've ever heard.

789
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,929
Silky and sexy. That's good. Ha, ha.

790
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,400
I don't know why, but I was kind of
surprised that you were into music.

791
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,331
- Yeah, me too.
- What?

792
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:10,831
I mean, I am.

793
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,839
Are you okay?
You keep checking your phone.

794
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,877
Yes. Um... Um...

795
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:21,249
My grandma fell and broke her hip.

796
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:23,285
So she just sends me updates.

797
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,684
- Old people and their cell phones.
Yeah.

798
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:28,758
- So I just I don't wanna miss anything.
- I hope she's okay.

799
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,485
But, uh, you were right.

800
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:34,654
I, um... I have been hiding.

801
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,425
- From your dead?
- Sorry?

802
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,901
<i>Dad.</i>

803
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:41,195
Dad.

804
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,370
- Hiding from your dad.
- Yes.

805
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,600
You seemed upset
that first day that we met.

806
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,942
And I thought maybe your dad
had something to do with it.

807
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:54,380
He wants me to be just like him.
And I wanna play music.

808
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,919
I don't wanna be
some suit managing musicians.

809
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,947
You feel like he wishes
you were a totally different person?

810
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,393
Yes. And sometimes I even wish that.

811
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,894
- Does that sound stupid?
- Yes.

812
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,259
Sorry?

813
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:11,301
I mean, no.

814
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:12,766
I mean, no.

815
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:15,906
So who is your favorite artist?

816
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:19,504
Today, it would have to be Moose.

817
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:20,803
Do you mean Muse?

818
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,179
Yeah, Muse. That's what I said.

819
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:24,972
Oh.

820
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:29,848
But old-school
would have to be John Lennon.

821
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:32,683
Oh, God, I love Lennon.
His lyrics are so honest.

822
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:36,388
His voice was just like an angle.

823
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,163
- An angle?
- Yeah.

824
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:42,064
Learn how to read.

825
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:45,566
Yeah, it would be like, uh, a right angle,
you know.

826
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,034
It would start out at 90 degrees.

827
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:52,700
And then it would just take you somewhere
that you never expected you would go.

828
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,837
- Doesn't really make any sense, does it?
- Not at all.

829
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:00,210
Maybe you could just ask me
another question.

830
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:03,080
I wasn't kidding when I said
we should write together.

831
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:04,653
That's not a question.

832
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:07,183
Oh, okay.

833
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,054
Um, how about what inspires you
to write music?

834
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,187
What inspires me?
That's a good question.

835
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:18,164
You know, I would have to say...
It would be, um...

836
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:21,197
Inspiration!

837
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:23,596
Oh. Wow. Ahem.

838
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:26,208
You know,
inspiration is such a deeply, uh...

839
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:31,781
It's personal. It's, like, kind of indefinable,
I guess you could say.

840
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:37,110
It's just personal. Oh, my God.

841
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:40,223
- I'm so sorry.
No, you're okay. Um...

842
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,019
Did it get on your jacket?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

843
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,219
No, you know what? You're fine.
It's just...

844
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,624
Oh, no. Uh...

845
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:50,392
- Is Grandma okay?
- Uh, no. Um, she has to go to the bathroom.

846
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:53,537
- Oh, she does tell you everything.
I should go to the bathroom too.

847
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:56,771
I'll be right back.

848
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:03,577
What are you doing? Get back out there.
This is working like a charm.

849
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,615
What do you want me to do?
Send smoke signals?

850
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:10,015
- No.
- Look, you can go back in there, okay?

851
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,621
But you are so in over your head
you don't even know it.

852
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,052
No, I'm not. You know what?

853
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:16,523
I'm so sick of using your words.
I don't need you.

854
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,787
I can do this on my own.
Luke wants me.

855
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,760
I talk good.

856
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:22,931
Hey, good luck.

857
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,972
- Hi.
- Sorry.

858
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,940
So let's talk classical music.
Who are your favorites?

859
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,134
Mozart.

860
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:36,010
Beethoven?

861
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:38,646
<i>Tchaikovsky. You are a Swan Lake girl,
aren't you?</i>

862
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,285
- I have bad news. My grandma croaked.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

863
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,887
- I should go.
- Look, if you wanna talk about it, l...

864
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:48,890
You know, I would prefer to remember
my grandma's memory in silence.

865
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,963
Crap.

866
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,268
Mah-meh, mah-meh.

867
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:07,842
Victor, if you have stolen my
commemorative Gandhi knife again...

868
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,639
...I will make you into a eunuch.

869
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,647
You were supposed to be
watching Victor.

870
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,151
You told me you wanted the chandelier
to sparkle.

871
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:20,848
Now I want you to throw out
my facelessness.

872
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,674
Victor, is Bev in?

873
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:45,547
<i>I'll tell you
When you can guess what song I'm playing</i>

874
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,076
Is Bev in?

875
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,616
Guess what song!

876
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,913
It doesn't sound like anything
I've ever heard!

877
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:55,457
That's because I don't know how to play!
We could be here all day!

878
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,457
Well, I could show you some chords!

879
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:02,093
- I thought you wanted to see Bev.
- Bev can wait a sec.

880
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,626
- Okay.
- Yeah?

881
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,201
Now, I'm gonna show you three chords.

882
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,395
- And we're gonna turn it into a song.
- Okay.

883
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:10,233
This is the first chord.

884
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,308
It's an E.

885
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,703
All right. Second chord.

886
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,069
Go to G. Slide it up.

887
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,939
Oh, yeah. Okay.

888
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:23,109
There we go.
Slide it up again. You got an A.

889
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,114
There. We're gonna put it together.

890
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,916
- It's gonna be a whole song.
- Okay.

891
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:32,923
Now.

892
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,480
Very good. You can play, you rascal.

893
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:01,853
If you practice and with that haircut,
you could be a Beatle.

894
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,256
No, The Stones are a lot better.

895
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,188
- Luke.
- Hey.

896
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,060
Hi.
- I keep running into you here.

897
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:12,031
But no partial nudity this time.

898
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:15,297
Um, I didn't know you and Bev
had a date today.

899
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,464
Oh, yeah.
No, I'm kind of surprising her.

900
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,041
I'll go get her.

901
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:23,370
He's crazy.

902
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,174
So it looks like she lost her head.

903
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:30,016
Oh. Yeah, it's an artist's rendition
of what's going on up there.

904
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,288
You play a Gallagher.

905
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,016
That is so cool.

906
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,126
- You know guitars.
- No. Uh-uh.

907
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,393
I mean, yeah, a little. Not really.

908
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:47,736
Yeah, I know. I like the way the, um...
The rosewood holds the, uh...

909
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,674
- The notes.
- Notes.

910
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,167
Notes, yeah. Um...

911
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,237
You always seem to disappear.
I really wish you wouldn't.

912
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,010
You're actually quite cool.

913
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:02,843
You think I'm cool?

914
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:07,817
Luke. Hi.

915
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,084
- What a surprise.
- Um...

916
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,093
- Oh, God, I love your skinny jeans.
- Oh, thank you. Uh...

917
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,429
I brought my guitar.
We could write that song.

918
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,396
- Awesome. Yeah.
- Okay.

919
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,935
Oh, yeah. I guess I gotta go disappear.

920
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:24,838
And can you just wait in there
for one minute?

921
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,847
- I need your new song.
- What? I'm not done yet.

922
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:39,353
Give me what you have so far.

923
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,787
- Come on.
- Don't break my heart.

924
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,790
I will break more than that.

925
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,724
- No, that's the lyric.
- What?

926
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,554
That's it?

927
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:51,357
You have had forever to work on this.
Oh, my God, you're giving me a twitch.

928
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,737
Fine.

929
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:00,467
Victor?

930
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,202
- Victor.
- Victor.

931
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,848
I know you're there.

932
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:14,887
You're trespassing
and you've just entered a world of hurt.

933
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,085
Yeah, well, I know all about
your surveillance crap, Victor.

934
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,730
Your cameras hidden in every nook
and cranny, I know.

935
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,990
- What kinds of nooks and crannies?
- You can't prove anything.

936
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,137
Well, I won't tell Mom
if you do me a favor.

937
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,266
I need Katie to talk to me
with no one knowing.

938
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,534
<i>- No one can hear her. She can hear me.
Don't.</i>

939
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,235
<i>- Is it possible?
- Say no.</i>

940
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,911
You've come to the right man.

941
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,840
Watch and learn, ladies.

942
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,459
I can hide a mike anywhere.

943
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:52,319
Mom swallowed one.

944
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,828
And you don't wanna hear the live feed,
trust me.

945
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:56,261
Oh, this is insane.

946
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,097
I guarantee my work.

947
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,302
- Hey, Victor, set up Katie.
- Okay.

948
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,234
Here you go, Katie.

949
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,304
I put this in my ear?

950
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:08,502
You put it on your ear and you talk.

951
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:12,778
Well, you are ugly,
you could probably fit all it in there.

952
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,941
Luke, I'm so sorry.

953
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,653
I have to give Katie a sisterly talk,
you know.

954
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,721
She's so high-maintenance. Ha, ha.

955
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,881
Anyway, well, where were we?

956
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,424
Uh, well, we hadn't started.

957
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:25,619
<i>- Perfect. Let's start.
Bev.</i>

958
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,320
Uh, Bev, hey, can you hear me?

959
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:29,090
<i>- What do you wanna start with?
Bev?</i>

960
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:30,392
- Yes.
- What?

961
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,262
What? Ha.

962
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:34,404
<i>You wanna sing and I'll play harmony?</i>

963
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,801
Uh, no.
I was thinking maybe you could sing...

964
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:39,238
...and I could give you some lyrics
that I wrote.

965
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,809
<i>That sounds good, okay.</i>

966
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,445
<i>- I... Um...
Yeah.</i>

967
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:44,906
They are, um... Um...

968
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:47,844
Don't break my heart.

969
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:49,917
<i>Don't break my heart.</i>

970
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:52,884
Before I give it to you.

971
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:54,713
Before I give it to you.

972
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:57,360
Don't break my heart
before I give it to you, okay.

973
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:00,563
<i>Don't tell me no.
- Don't tell me no.</i>

974
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,431
Before I ask you to.

975
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,261
Before I ask you to.

976
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:07,301
Don't tell me no, before I ask you to.

977
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,938
- Yeah.
- That's good. Um...

978
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,364
Thanks.

979
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,509
Don't break my heart.

980
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,909
<i>More?</i>

981
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,412
Don't say it doesn't fit.

982
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:20,209
Don't say it doesn't fit.

983
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:22,185
Before you try it on.

984
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:23,877
Before you try it on.

985
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,614
Don't say it doesn't fit
before you try it on.

986
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,916
Try it on.

987
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,957
- I like it.
- Thanks. Ha, ha.

988
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,696
Um, there's too much to lose.

989
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:37,390
<i>- There's so much to lose.
Too much to lose.</i>

990
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:39,399
Too much to lose.

991
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,231
<i>To be wrong.
- To be wrong.</i>

992
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:45,967
Too much to lose to be wrong.

993
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,839
<i>- Yeah. That's good.
Yeah.</i>

994
01:00:49,513 --> 01:00:50,605
More? You got any more?

995
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:53,614
<i>Yeah.
- And it feels like there's something here.</i>

996
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:57,118
And it feels like
there's something here.

997
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,679
And it feels like
there's something here.

998
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:02,826
But I wanna see it
before it disappears.

999
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:06,660
But I wanna see it
before it disappears.

1000
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,095
- Yeah.
Do you like that?

1001
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,438
And if there's something real
between me and you.

1002
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:19,504
And if there's something real
between me and you.

1003
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:24,010
<i>If there's something real between...
- Or are we both open to.</i>

1004
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,717
<i>Don't break my heart before I give it to you</i>

1005
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:36,386
<i>Don't tell me no before I ask you to</i>

1006
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:41,554
<i>Don't say it doesn't fit before you try it on</i>

1007
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:45,361
<i>There's too much to lose to be wrong</i>

1008
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,104
<i>And it feels like there's something here</i>

1009
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:56,038
<i>But I wanna see it before it disappears</i>

1010
01:01:56,213 --> 01:02:00,980
<i>And if there's something real
Between me and you</i>

1011
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:05,110
<i>Well, are we both open to</i>

1012
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:09,453
<i>All these possibilities</i>

1013
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:14,256
<i>So many little possibilities</i>

1014
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,135
Who wants pie?
Ugh!

1015
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:31,314
Sorry. Um, I was just gonna go
get some pie and thinking:

1016
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:35,578
"Why should I get pie for myself. There
might be other people that want some pie?"

1017
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:36,910
I want pie.

1018
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,022
No, Katie, there's no pie needs here
at the moment. Thank you.

1019
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,316
You know what? I should go.

1020
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:44,620
Um, I've got some acts to finalize
for the Showcase so I'II, uh...

1021
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:47,696
We were singing.
And we were doing things.

1022
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:49,856
And it was amazing. All of it.

1023
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,433
And I'll catch you later, okay?

1024
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:54,131
Okay, I'll walk you out.

1025
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,204
- Okay.
- Okay.

1026
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,001
What are you doing in my bed?

1027
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:33,439
While waiting for you,
I meditated so strenuously that I fell asleep.

1028
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:37,603
Mr. Victor,
time for your weekly meditation.

1029
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:43,015
Today, we are working on, uh,
silence and potty training.

1030
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:45,246
<i>Oh, sit.</i>

1031
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:47,951
<i>I said sit.</i>

1032
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:51,356
What in the name of Bhuvaneshwari?

1033
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:56,596
Holy cow.

1034
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,930
<i>Uh, a bottle of wine ago,
I was gonna be sweet as sugar...</i>

1035
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:04,870
...and apologize for living up
to the stereotype of stepmotherhood.

1036
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,202
Dumb.

1037
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:11,277
<i>You know, but making you watch
my real daughter steal the boy you like...</i>

1038
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,745
...and the song you wrote.

1039
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,515
You're saying you're sorry?

1040
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:17,210
Oh, bless your heart. No, no, no.

1041
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:23,292
I came to my senses and I realized
it was better to just tell you the truth.

1042
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:26,956
You are never gonna amount
to anything.

1043
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,257
My mom is a beyotch.

1044
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:32,266
And you're a sneaky, sneaky spy,
Mr. Victor.

1045
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:33,903
How many cameras do you have?

1046
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,801
Enough to know your accent's
faker than my mom's soul.

1047
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:40,432
Oh, and don't get the dumb idea
to throw that Showcase.

1048
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:41,942
Because I talked to a lawyer.

1049
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:46,811
And he found a loophole that allows me
to access that money your daddy left you...

1050
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,544
...should I need it for a medical reason.

1051
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,587
<i>You know, hello, longer legs.</i>

1052
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:56,419
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Before you go...
- I'll sing for Bev. Don't worry.

1053
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,918
Well, that was easier than I thought.

1054
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:00,961
Now, go and make me a vodka tonic.

1055
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,689
Hold the tonic.

1056
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,400
Her reign of terror's gotta stop.

1057
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,102
I'm in. What do we do?

1058
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,111
Look, there's nothing you can do.

1059
01:05:18,782 --> 01:05:21,148
If you try to help,
it's just gonna make it worse.

1060
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:24,344
That woman is a demon
spawned from darkness itself.

1061
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:25,852
I wish she'd go straight back to...

1062
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,854
Hello, Ms. Gail.

1063
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:31,426
Have you, uh, released your mind
from the shackles of thinking today?

1064
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,495
- I'm working on it.
- Very good.

1065
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:36,494
- How was your meditation?
I hate you.

1066
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:39,131
Very good. You look pretty.

1067
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:40,998
I know.

1068
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:45,506
That broad
ain't getting away with ruining your life.

1069
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:47,337
I'm pooping in her bed tonight.

1070
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:50,344
Victor, I thought you hated me.

1071
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:51,606
Are you an idiot?

1072
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,943
You're the only person
who knows my birthday.

1073
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,982
The only one who says goodnight
to me.

1074
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,553
The only one who makes me
mac and cheese.

1075
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:00,917
You're annoying and ugly...

1076
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,490
...but I sort of love you.

1077
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:06,555
I sort of love you too.

1078
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:11,624
But just promise me
you're not gonna do anything, okay?

1079
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:13,694
- You too.
- Oh, come on.

1080
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:15,804
- Just... No... Ple...
- Just... No. Just...

1081
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,462
- No. Tony.
- Just one...

1082
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:19,706
Okay.

1083
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:24,379
All right.
Well, now I get to go fold Bev's delicates.

1084
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:43,525
- Have you heard of knocking?
- Ever heard of I don't care?

1085
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,961
Where'd you put my blue blouse?

1086
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:48,229
Oh, okay.

1087
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,930
Okay, which one of these
do you like better?

1088
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:55,744
- You actually want my opinion?
- God, I know. What's wrong with me?

1089
01:06:56,713 --> 01:07:00,615
You know how you're a bitch and I act
like I don't care, but truth is I'm sensitive?

1090
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:03,309
- Actually...
- I need someone to talk to like a sister...

1091
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,387
...and you're better than nothing.

1092
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:11,294
I'm nervous about tonight.
Oh, my God, why did I just tell you that?

1093
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:15,256
I don't know.

1094
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,863
It's like my whole body is freaking out.

1095
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,126
I have hives on my butt.

1096
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:21,770
I can't tell Mom
and I can't talk to Luke about it.

1097
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:23,303
He'll say something like:

1098
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:26,408
"Oh, one minute
you're talented and we're connecting...

1099
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,807
...and the next minute you're self-involved
and histrionic."

1100
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:33,211
- What does that even mean? I hate history.
- He said that?

1101
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,919
Listen, Toadie, he's not falling for you,
he's falling for me.

1102
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:40,784
I just don't know who me is anymore.

1103
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:43,255
Why are you nervous?
You're not really singing.

1104
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:46,487
All you have to do is stand there
and look pretty.

1105
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,897
Have you ever thought
about how that makes me feel?

1106
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,168
You have talent.

1107
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:56,828
<i>You could go on American Idol
and forget about the rest of us.</i>

1108
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,405
This is, like, my only chance.

1109
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,839
Pretty doesn't last very long.

1110
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:03,946
Just look at Mom.

1111
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:07,242
You think I'm talented?

1112
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,145
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it.

1113
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,380
Wear the blue blouse.

1114
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,526
It makes your eyes pop.

1115
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:20,857
This better work.

1116
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,661
Because if I go down,
you're go down with me.

1117
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:40,309
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's up, my party people?

1118
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:43,578
Yeah. All right, all right, all right.
Let's get this show started.

1119
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:47,746
Welcome to the stage, my boy, my British
biscuit and y'all's host for the night...

1120
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:50,415
...Luke Morgan.

1121
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:55,988
Are you amped for the Wellesley Academy
of the Arts Showcase?

1122
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:01,630
Good. Because we have Mickey O'Malley
spinning tonight.

1123
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:11,639
So let's get this party started
with Big Pain Ticket.

1124
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:25,157
<i>I wanna kiss your apocalypse</i>

1125
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:28,422
<i>Wrap you in my Armageddon</i>

1126
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:32,090
<i>Sing you a twisted serenade</i>

1127
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,329
<i>We can run away together</i>

1128
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:48,245
Hello, Guy. So glad you could make it.

1129
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:51,444
My two A&R guys, Tom and, uh, Tom.

1130
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:53,387
Uh, did I miss your big line up?

1131
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:57,152
You're just in time. And I know
you'll love the closing act. She's amazing.

1132
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,022
Well, I expect nothing less.

1133
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:04,428
Oh, yeah. Nothing and less are definitely
two words I'd use to describe it.

1134
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:07,229
Why don't I show you and the Toms
to the VIP section.

1135
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:10,931
Katie, go help Bev
with her makeup, please.

1136
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:12,768
- Okay.
- Now.

1137
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:14,968
This way, please, come on.

1138
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:17,204
What a lovely suit.

1139
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:22,877
Move it.

1140
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:25,453
Hey. Out of the way. Out of the way.
Michael, go on.

1141
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:27,886
I have to announce what's next.
I'll see you at the end.

1142
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:29,923
Guy. Tom. Tom.

1143
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,959
I'll be right back.

1144
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:35,759
Good to see you.

1145
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,797
Nice suit.

1146
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:48,577
What was that back there?
This is your last chance to get it right.

1147
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,714
Unless you wanna see
Angela's Juilliard dreams go bye-bye.

1148
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:55,840
That what you wanna be? A little
dwarfish Asian girl's dream crusher, huh?

1149
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:57,043
- Do you?
- No. No.

1150
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,087
No? No? No? Then focus!

1151
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,257
- Look, Ange, you...
- Gail's been threatening me too.

1152
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,456
That's why you're doing
what she wants.

1153
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,098
- To protect me.
- Ange.

1154
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,637
You're my best friend.

1155
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,239
Look, I'd do anything for you.

1156
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,549
Okay.

1157
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:37,317
So we're gonna take it up a notch
with Jason Berkeley and the Funky Funk.

1158
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,190
Scratch that.

1159
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:47,302
Um, here are my boys, the Oral Majority.

1160
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,480
<i>I'm lost in a world that rattles my brain</i>

1161
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:02,550
<i>Cleaning up my life
From the mess you made, oh, oh</i>

1162
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:06,720
Move it. Guy.

1163
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:11,088
This is just the boring appetizer.
The real showstopper's up next.

1164
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:12,728
Ah!
Oh!

1165
01:12:12,896 --> 01:12:15,763
You okay, Mr. Morgan?
Here, let me get that for you.

1166
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,394
Well, it had better be.

1167
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:19,796
I have to pee.

1168
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:23,200
Oh, I will take you to the pee, Mr. Victor.

1169
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:27,973
Sorry.

1170
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,936
<i>So keep on knocking, knocking, knocking</i>

1171
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:36,051
<i>But, baby, you're better off walking
'Cause I ain't gonna let you in</i>

1172
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:38,947
<i>Never again</i>

1173
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:42,182
<i>No, not again</i>

1174
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,724
<i>Never again</i>

1175
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:48,227
<i>No, not again</i>

1176
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,367
My brothers, yeah!

1177
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:55,936
Okay.

1178
01:12:56,272 --> 01:12:58,433
You guys having a good time?

1179
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:03,411
Let's keep it going
with Beverly Van Ravensway.

1180
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:17,755
<i>Plug in the mike</i>

1181
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:19,224
<i>Open the curtain</i>

1182
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,760
<i>Turn on the lights</i>

1183
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:22,997
<i>I'm through rehearsing</i>

1184
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:25,259
<i>The feeling ignites</i>

1185
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:26,493
<i>I'm in control</i>

1186
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:30,765
<i>The crowd's in the palm of my hand
All my fans stand</i>

1187
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:34,376
<i>What is the truth?
What's an illusion?</i>

1188
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:38,241
<i>You're searching for proof
But are you certain?</i>

1189
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,975
<i>Whatever you see is what you get</i>

1190
01:13:42,152 --> 01:13:45,952
<i>If words paint a picture
Then I bet you I can get you, yeah</i>

1191
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:50,354
<i>I'll make you believe in me</i>

1192
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:53,758
<i>I can be what you want me to be</i>

1193
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,366
<i>Tonight is the night
Where I'll make you see</i>

1194
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:01,231
<i>That I can be
Anything, anything, anything</i>

1195
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:05,807
<i>I'll make you believe in me</i>

1196
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,442
<i>I can be what you want...</i>

1197
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,338
Give me...

1198
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:23,118
I'm so sorry, my mike...
My mike isn't working.

1199
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:26,017
Uh, excuse me.

1200
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:31,025
<i>I don't know.
- Give me that. Give me that.</i>

1201
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:40,471
How dare you sabotage your mother,
you rotten, rotten little boy?

1202
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,203
You, give me that. It doesn't matter.

1203
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:46,075
- We'll do it live.
- What? What?

1204
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,384
Ha. My mike is broken. I'm so sorry.

1205
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:55,450
Here.

1206
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,157
What?

1207
01:14:58,328 --> 01:14:59,955
Stay.

1208
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:06,231
No, no, no. You gotta get out of here.

1209
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:09,935
You're about to sing for Bev.
Why are you about to sing for Bev?

1210
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:11,898
She can't sing.

1211
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:19,610
Come on.

1212
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:21,682
Hey. All of you, keep playing.

1213
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,149
Keep playing, you idiots.

1214
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,618
It was your voice the whole time?
Bev never sang at all?

1215
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:31,591
And she's about to not sing
for a whole bunch of people, so please...

1216
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:34,958
And on the dates, that... That was you.

1217
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,529
<i>I got nothing to lose</i>

1218
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:43,403
<i>I've been exposed</i>

1219
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:45,700
<i>I'm paying my dues</i>

1220
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,035
<i>Playing the role</i>

1221
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,576
<i>I'm breaking the rules</i>

1222
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:50,940
<i>Flow in the flow</i>

1223
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:55,073
<i>I got the whole world nodding, yes
Like some bobbleheads</i>

1224
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:56,616
<i>I'll break a sweat</i>

1225
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,844
<i>If you want it</i>

1226
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:01,149
<i>Confess all your sins</i>

1227
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:02,621
<i>You know you got 'em</i>

1228
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:05,056
<i>The room's in a spin</i>

1229
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,252
<i>The fever's pitched</i>

1230
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:08,397
- You gotta go. Come on, get out there.
Aah!

1231
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,361
<i>I'm legit, I'm no counterfeit</i>

1232
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:14,993
<i>I'll make you believe in me</i>

1233
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,935
<i>I can be what you want me to be</i>

1234
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:21,770
<i>Tonight is the night where I make you see</i>

1235
01:16:21,945 --> 01:16:25,574
<i>That I can be
Anything, anything, anything</i>

1236
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:30,151
<i>I'll make you believe in me</i>

1237
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,514
<i>I can be what you want me to be</i>

1238
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:34,486
Hey! Shut that camera down! Now!

1239
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:37,125
<i>Tonight is the night where I make you see</i>

1240
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:41,195
<i>That I can be
Anything, anything, anything</i>

1241
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:43,457
<i>You want from me</i>

1242
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,703
That's what I'm talking about.

1243
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:56,034
Shut the power down. Shut it down.

1244
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:01,582
Not so fast, jerknuts.

1245
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:06,252
Hey. Clear.

1246
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,759
<i>Sing something else.
We want more! We want more!</i>

1247
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:13,225
Like what?

1248
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:15,361
The demo you snuck my dad. I heard it.

1249
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,328
Yeah, do it!
Do it!

1250
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,870
<i>We want more!
We want more! We want more!</i>

1251
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,609
Okay, follow my lead, guys.

1252
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:39,311
<i>There's a little secret
I would like to tell you</i>

1253
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:47,055
<i>There's a book of lies
I know they'll try to sell you</i>

1254
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:51,858
<i>And they'll try and they'll try
To convince you to buy</i>

1255
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,525
<i>You need them</i>

1256
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:58,941
<i>So the next time you're down
Look inside, not around</i>

1257
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:02,271
<i>I can dress myself</i>

1258
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:05,380
<i>There's no need for someone's help</i>

1259
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:07,175
<i>There's no one to blame</i>

1260
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:13,084
<i>There's no one to save you but yourself</i>

1261
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:16,555
<i>I can justify</i>

1262
01:18:16,726 --> 01:18:19,695
<i>All the mistakes in my life</i>

1263
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:23,059
<i>It's taught me to be
It's given to me</i>

1264
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:25,632
<i>And I'll survive</i>

1265
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:28,930
<i>'Cause I have blessed myself</i>

1266
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:37,278
<i>Do you ever wonder
How anything can make you cry?</i>

1267
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:41,110
<i>Have yourself discover</i>

1268
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:48,281
<i>That the pain you feel
Is the pain that you deny</i>

1269
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:51,723
<i>You can bless yourself</i>

1270
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,795
<i>There's no need for someone else</i>

1271
01:18:54,964 --> 01:19:02,393
<i>There's no one to blame
There's no one to save you but yourself</i>

1272
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,769
<i>I can justify</i>

1273
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,911
<i>All the mistakes in my life</i>

1274
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:12,172
<i>It's taught me to be
It's given to me</i>

1275
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,839
<i>And I'll survive</i>

1276
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,747
<i>'Cause I have blessed myself</i>

1277
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,932
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1278
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:40,507
We hope you enjoyed the Wellesley
Academy of Arts Showcase.

1279
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:43,236
Oh, my God, you were so good.

1280
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:45,945
Who are you?
You're like a freaking rock star.

1281
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,208
Are you kidding me? Man, she likes you...

1282
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:02,363
So, what did he say? Is he mad?

1283
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:04,193
Yeah. He's pretty ticked off...

1284
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:08,133
...that I'm not already making
the next big album for Kensington Records.

1285
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,869
Oh. Which album?

1286
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:13,799
Your album.

1287
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,469
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1288
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,549
- You're... You're serious?
- Uh-huh.

1289
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:25,117
Go for it.

1290
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:28,052
We're making an album.
And we're writing it together.

1291
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:30,283
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm so happy.

1292
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:32,256
You know, I sing too.

1293
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:36,057
I can do a whole monologue album.
Incredible. Hey, congratulations.

1294
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:40,760
- Yo, blow it up. Boom.
I'm your boy. Call me up.

1295
01:20:40,937 --> 01:20:44,338
Yeah. Yeah, he's really good
at guitars. He's a kook.

1296
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:00,647
Guy! Wait!

1297
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:04,315
- What now, Gail? More lies?
- Well, everyone lies in this business.

1298
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:05,517
It's called spin.

1299
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:07,527
So Bev can't sing.

1300
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,426
That didn't stop Jessica Simpson.

1301
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:13,194
Well, we'll see what the school board
thinks when I get them a ring, shall we?

1302
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:16,367
How dare you? Teaching is my life.

1303
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:18,473
Give it up, Mom.

1304
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:22,143
Guy!

1305
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:27,142
I will have my nirvana moment.

1306
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:31,149
<i>I'll make you believe in me</i>

1307
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:35,682
<i>I can be what you want me to be</i>

1308
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:38,452
Oh, come on. Look alive, people.
I'm a star.

1309
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:40,186
Let's try this again.

1310
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,261
<i>I'll make you believe...</i>

1311
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:46,563
Oh, no. You want a piece of me?

1312
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:14,458
Hey. Clear.

1313
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,307
<i>Run this town tonight</i>

1314
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:34,847
Where's breakfast...? Sorry.

1315
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:19,320
<i>I'm lost in a world
That rattles my brain</i>

1316
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,362
<i>I'm cleaning up my life
From the mess you made, oh, oh</i>

1317
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,863
- Katie, are you wearing a doormat?
- Welcome.

1318
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:39,372
Thanks. Now the pants.

1319
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:48,853
And then it would just take you somewhere
that you never expected you would go.

1320
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:56,287
<i>You wanna hear
the monologue from My Fair Lady?</i>

1321
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:58,592
Oy, mate, oy.

1322
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:19,952
I love my life.

1323
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:22,317
<i>Call me.
- Hello?</i>

1324
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,977
<i>Yeah. You like it? You like it? Yeah.</i>
