<i>As ifhe was being tortured.</i>
<i>But that's not what it means here.</i>

160
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,609
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.

161
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,615
He didn't bite him.

162
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,049
Good.

163
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,283
We need to talk.

164
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,625
I think you have a little spinach
or something in your teeth.

165
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,164
I want you to route all calls
through to my cell.

166
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,139
You picked a hell of a day
to start your field work.

167
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,803
- Button up your jacket.
- Why? What goin' on?

168
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,575
<i>Dispatch, this is Charlie 9. Units on scene.</i>

169
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:49,621
- <i>Here comes the Secret Service.</i>
- I really don't need them breathin' down my neck.

170
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,713
What do they know
about investigatin' murder?

171
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,388
She can breathe
down my neck.

172
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,463
But not him.

173
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,260
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.

174
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,562
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.

175
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,695
<i>The way I see it,</i>
<i>he hands over the wallet.</i>

176
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,429
As the guy reaches for it,
Merriweather goes for his gun.

177
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,869
<i>Bad guy shoots him first.</i>

178
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,276
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.

179
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,971
You know my problem
with gut feelings?

180
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,674
Once you have them,
the only evidence you see...

181
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,842
is the evidence that reinforces
your gut feeling.

182
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,115
- <i>Human nature.</i>
- There's no money left in his wallet...

183
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,054
and there's been a series of robberies here
the last two months.

184
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,683
<i>You have some reason to think</i>
<i>it wasn't a robbery?</i>

185
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,491
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years
honing his ability to sense danger...

186
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,497
to notice anything
outside of the ordinary...

187
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,558
so for some average street criminal to get
the drop on him... yeah, it raises questions.

188
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,868
Not to mention that he's been
shot here twice with a.45.

189
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:21,003
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial
canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.

190
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,241
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort
of thing happens all the time.

191
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,080
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.

192
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,567
- Rosario.

193
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,833
Anyone want anything
to eat or drink?

194
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,172
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.

195
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,543
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.

196
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,946
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.

197
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,679
- You gonna make me change my mind?

198
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:06,087
<i>Detective, take a look at the bullet mark</i>
<i>on the doorjamb. The slug didn't penetrate.</i>

199
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,752
<i>It's cedar, which is a soft wood.</i>
<i>It gets brittle with age.</i>

200
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,128
- <i>So what are you sayin'?</i>
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.

201
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,531
And that's what slowed down
the velocity of the bullet...

202
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,762
and stopped it
from penetrating the wood...

203
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:24,309
which it easily would have done had it been
traveling at its normal rate of speed.

204
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,571
The shooter was standing
right here.

205
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,613
<i>One other thing, Detective.</i>

206
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,584
Excuse me. Agent Merriweather's
firearm... the safety's still on.

207
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,553
We assumed he just didn't
have time to flick it off.

208
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:42,787
Agent Marin, why don't you explain
to the detectives why that is unlikely.

209
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,888
If he was a police officer, it would make
sense because your academy trains you...

210
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,298
to draw your weapon and flip
the safety in two separate actions...

211
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,461
to avoid accidental shootings.

212
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,165
Our academy trains us to draw
and flip in a single motion.

213
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,072
If he managed to draw his weapon,
his safety should have been off.

214
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,340
<i>Aprotective agent maybe draws his weapon</i>
<i>once an entire presidential term.</i>

215
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,974
<i>When we draw our weapon,</i>
<i>we intend to use it.</i>

216
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,348
Bottom line...
Agent Merriweather was assassinated.

217
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,787
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.

218
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,691
If this man was one of yours, you would have
treated him with a lot more respect.

219
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,258
Let's get a gurney up here!

220
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,840
<i>It always amazes me</i>
<i>how thorough you are.</i>

221
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,508
Well, we try to do
the best job we can.

222
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,949
Hopefully you sleep better at night.

223
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,717
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola. We're good on the perimeter.

224
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,520
- <i>I'm 10-60.</i>
- Uh, roger, 10-60.

225
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,530
I let DiPaola go early,
so, uh, he can...

226
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,600
get something to eat.

227
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,738
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,308
You all right?

229
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,354
I missed you.
I missed you so much.

230
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,550
- Just a second.
- Okay.

231
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,204
- This is outstanding.
- There you go. And enjoy.

232
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,489
I love you, Sarah.

233
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,651
- <i>Garrison, DiPaola. Where are you?</i>

234
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,228
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.

235
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,167
Yeah, I'm on my way.

236
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,637
Hi. So what the hell
is going on, or...

237
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,141
Aziz, what are you doin' here?

238
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,838
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.

239
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,077
He... He was murdered?

240
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,278
P.I.D. Thinks it might
be connected to work.

241
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,220
Director put us on alert.

242
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,951
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.

243
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,124
Was there any kind
of shift in his behavior?

244
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,199
Was he agitated
or worried about anything?

245
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,362
<i>He was a little distant</i>
<i>at breakfast on Sunday.</i>

246
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,466
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple
of tough days at work.

247
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:23,810
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.

248
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,145
Nancy, I know how difficult
this is for you...

249
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:31,154
but I need a complete picture
if I'm gonna investigate this properly.

250
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:35,192
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was
having an affair with someone's wife at work.

251
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,162
- Just gossip. It just...
- Yeah.

252
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,994
Probably not even true.

253
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,262
Look, that's all we need for now.

254
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,976
- <i>You got the lead on Charlie's murder?</i>
- Screw you.

255
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,742
- What?
- Screw you.

256
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,647
- You still got a problem with me?
- <i>Take your hands off of me.</i>

257
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,020
Christ. It doesn't matter
what I say to you.

258
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,593
I don't care if you got
a problem with me...

259
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,687
but you show respect
when you come to this house.

260
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,766
Charlie was one of my best friends.

261
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,596
If you have information
that can help me, that I want to hear.

262
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,263
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine. You're a piece of work.

263
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,272
You know, Nancy did say one thing.

264
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,571
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?

265
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,374
- No.
- Then if you figure it out,
you know where to find me.

266
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,382
- Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.

267
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,112
- Hey. Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill. Yeah.

268
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,188
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,484
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.

270
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,684
But don't listen
to everything he's got to say.

271
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,057
- Especially about me.
- <i>Okay.</i>

272
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,596
Pete.

273
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,098
There some problem between you two?

274
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,396
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.

275
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,370
- So what happened?
- It's personal.

276
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,532
<i>Let's go.</i>

277
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,907
- No. He can go to hell. I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.

278
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,980
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.

279
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,549
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.

280
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,917
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already
told him 30 times? This is why I left him.

281
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,855
He's the most pigheaded man
I've ever met.

282
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,428
You still love him, don't you?

283
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,281
- <i>Hey, Pete. Pete.</i>
- Hey, Tom.

284
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,283
You know a guy
named Walter Xavier?

285
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,445
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use
when I was working in counterfeiting.

286
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,455
Okay. Just fielded a call
from this guy.

287
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,616
I told him you weren't
running informants anymore...

288
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,661
offered to transfer
the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.

289
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,926
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.

290
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:06,174
<i>There he is! Publishers Clearing House,</i>
<i>my man! You got somethin'for me?</i>

291
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,803
Did you fill yours out yet?

292
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,782
<i>Every year my mom bugs me</i>
<i>to fill that thing out. I never do.</i>

293
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,818
<i>Long time, no see, Walter.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

294
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,888
Let's walk.

295
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,589
You got some info on that
Charlie Merriweather murder?

296
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,390
- That agent who was killed
outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.

297
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,466
Maybe he stumbled into something
he wasn't supposed to, like I did.

298
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,003
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.

299
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,840
Walter, you know, it's a little
more difficult than it sounds.

300
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,503
Not if you got somebody inside.

301
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,613
You saying there's a mole
in the Secret Service?

302
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,616
That's right.

303
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,710
- There's an agent who wants to
help assassinate the president?
- That's right.

304
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,518
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know. I just know he exists.

305
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,856
Well, how? Who... Who's giving
you the information?

306
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,487
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?

307
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,657
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.

308
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:10,237
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up,
they gonna know I'm the one.

309
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,537
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.

310
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:16,546
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.

311
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,776
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.

312
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,116
Lfind it pretty far-fetched we got agents
in on an assassination attempt.

313
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,622
Here. Maybe this will change
your mind, okay?

314
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,993
<i>Call signs, code words,</i>
<i>today's encryption keys!</i>

315
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,004
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...

316
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,007
they're either on the president's detail
or in a key liaison position.

317
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,873
Listen, I want a list of everyone
who's got "Q" clearance.

318
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,946
And where's the president
right now?

319
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,379
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.

320
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:56,113
<i>This morning's action demonstrates</i>
<i>our continuing resolve...</i>

321
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,917
to take on the infrastructure
of terrorism...

322
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,049
wherever we find it
anywhere around the globe.

323
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,252
How reliable is this guy Xavier?

324
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,455
I've built three counterfeiting cases
using his information.

325
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,160
- <i>Against who?</i>
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.

326
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,471
Sir. That's everyone
with "Q" clearance.

327
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,734
<i>Those who actually commit terrorist acts.</i>

328
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,968
<i>Now let me point out,</i>
<i>this is very important...</i>

329
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,671
Polygraph everyone
on that list...

330
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,214
and stand up a red team
to find the traitor.

331
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,615
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit
on Merriweather is connected to this...

332
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,983
<i>so let's fold that investigation in as well.</i>

333
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,421
- And we put Breckinridge
in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?

334
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:37,461
- Yeah.
- Pete. He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?

335
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:41,521
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- <i>Then he's the guy.</i>

336
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,760
You can have anybody you want.

337
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,668
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.

338
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,104
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.

339
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,201
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.

340
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,974
She hasn't been ruined
by years in the field.

341
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:02,076
<i>I will blow you up.</i>
<i>I come to bomb this country.</i>

342
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,987
<i>Holy wars.</i>

343
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,218
We have intel that
representatives of Al-Qaeda...

344
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,193
have met on at least two occasions
with the Barranquilla leadership.

345
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,164
You think it's timed to coincide
with the Camp David talks?

346
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,826
Probably. The threat alone
interferes with the process.

347
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,563
<i>We pulled 50 agents</i>
<i>in from the field.</i>

348
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,004
People who haven't worked
at the White House in at least two cycles.

349
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,133
They'll integrate
with both of your teams.

350
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,406
We're all gonna be looking over
each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.

351
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,820
Well, do what you have to to protect me,
but I want the threat...

352
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:47,990
the investigation,
I want everything kept classified.

353
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,660
<i>As far as the public is concerned,</i>
<i>I'm just carrying on my normal business.</i>

354
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,670
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President...

355
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,899
we're going to need to get
everyone involved here.

356
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,567
What do you think would happen
to the power of the president...

357
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,271
if people thought I wasn't even safe
from my own Secret Service?

358
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,746
It took over 200 years to create
the symbol of the presidency...

359
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,943
and I'm not gonna undermine it
with something like this.

360
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,819
- Let's circle the wagons, okay? You all right?
- Fine.

361
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,891
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?

362
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,654
Bill, you're the guy.

363
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,127
You're the last line of defense.

364
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,266
You can protect him better
than any of us can.

365
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,998
Is there anything else that you can think of
that'll help you do that?

366
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,734
- Yeah.

367
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,935
This.

368
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:39,409
<i>And I promise you, right here and now,</i>
<i>We're gonna win this one.</i>

369
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,611
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much. Good night.

370
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,951
Good night. Thank you.

371
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,854
Heads it's Sixth Street,
tails it's Eighth.

372
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,297
Bravo cars.

373
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,567
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.

374
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,762
Classic is moving to bravo cars.

375
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,806
<i>Copy that. Command to alpha cars.</i>
<i>You are off the hook.</i>

376
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,568
Sir, could you put down that knife?

377
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,577
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.

378
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,647
Hello, young lady.

379
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,487
Where'd this guy come from?

380
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,956
He's an old C.I. Of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.

381
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,027
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,937
What's wrong?

383
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,311
It's nothing.

384
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,145
- Are you sure?
- Yes. It's okay.

385
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,517
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.

386
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,819
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- <i>You ever tried?</i>

387
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,987
- What?
- Have you ever tried?

388
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,330
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.

389
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,870
You better be right.

390
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,430
You get in touch with us
as soon as you find him.

391
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,572
<i>Could be any one of them.</i>
<i>It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?</i>

392
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:55,676
- <i>What percentage of your people</i>
<i>have had a polygraph?</i>
- A little over half.

393
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,756
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.

394
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,924
Heads up!

395
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:08,362
I want everybody in this room to have had
a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. This afternoon...

396
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,458
<i>or don't show up for work tomorrow.</i>

397
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,707
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.

398
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,743
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.

399
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,369
- <i>Were you born in Alabama?</i>
- No.

400
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,210
<i>Have you ever had contact</i>
<i>with child pornography?</i>

401
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,944
Uh, yes. I was involved
with an investigation with the bureau...

402
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:33,615
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan. Yes.

403
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,126
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.

404
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,201
Get your polygraph today.

405
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,473
How did they get these?

406
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,511
Night-vision camera on a boat
stabilized by a gyroscope.

407
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,580
Pretty sophisticated.

408
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,457
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

409
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,617
I'm sorry.

410
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,662
It's gotta be someone
inside the Service.

411
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,825
<i>Somebody could have picked it up.</i>
<i>They're good. That's what they do.</i>

412
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,835
Who?

413
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,098
The same agent plotting
to killJohn? Who?

414
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,733
141 years there's never been
a traitor in the Secret Service.

415
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,210
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.

416
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,282
Somehow they're connected.

417
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,647
Maybe this is the assassination?

418
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,619
This is a death sentence forJohn,
a political death sentence.

419
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,815
That's not gonna happen.

420
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,858
Oh, Pete.

421
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,327
<i>Sarah, I promise.</i>

422
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,364
Let's get this goddamn
witch hunt over with.

423
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,330
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.

424
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,335
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.

425
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,703
- Have you received adequate training
for your profession?
- No.

426
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,038
But I did stay
in a Holiday Inn Express.

427
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,704
<i>Have you ever violated Secret Service</i>
<i>protocol in the past 30 days?</i>

428
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,078
No.

429
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,174
Have you done anything
in the past 30 days...

430
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,253
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.

431
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,323
<i>Are you involved in a plot to kill</i>
<i>the president of the United States?</i>

432
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,153
No.

433
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,835
I could use a few of those.

434
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,441
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.

435
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,248
- You look worse.

436
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,358
I haven't slept since
we went on alert.

437
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,090
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.

438
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,593
<i>Have you done your polygraph yet?</i>

439
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:02,799
- You know I can't even
let you back on duty unless...
- Yeah, I'll go now.

440
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,035
- <i>Is your name Peter Garrison?</i>
- Yes.

441
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,080
- <i>Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?</i>
- No.

442
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,810
- <i>Were you divorced in 1998?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

443
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,321
<i>Have you violated Secret Service</i>
<i>protocols in the last 30 days?</i>

444
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,351
No.

445
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,690
Have you done anything
to endanger the life...

446
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,991
of our president
in the last six months?

447
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,601
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.

448
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,670
No. No.

449
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,110
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.

450
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,849
- <i>Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?</i>
<i>Just a moment, sir.</i>

451
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,394
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.

452
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,794
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.

453
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:05,267
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks
east on Massachusetts Avenue.

454
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,930
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.

455
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,718
<i>Now boarding on track 4, 12: 13 Acela Express...</i>

456
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,626
<i>with stops in Philadelphia,</i>
<i>New York, Boston.</i>

457
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,789
<i>Now boarding, track 4.</i>

458
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,050
- F.B.I. Drop it!

459
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,644
- Federal agent! Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze! Put it down!

460
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,725
- The gun is going down!
- All right. Back up now. Back up.

461
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,453
<i>Turn around!</i>

462
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:27,431
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.

463
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,565
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?

464
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,837
Sorry for the crossover.

465
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,678
<i>Pete! I called four times.</i>
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

466
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,688
We're not out of here till tomorrow.

467
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,658
The president decided they should arrive
at the summit together. Where were you?

468
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,025
Oh! Excuse me.

469
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,533
Oh, here we are. Now, Kate, this
is your weekend to catch the trout.

470
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,832
- I don't like worms.
- No, no. This is fly-fishing.

471
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,318
Pete, can I talk
to you a minute?

472
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,412
Yes, sir.

473
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,426
We're really, both of us...

474
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,795
in uncharted territory here,
aren't we?

475
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,632
An assassin inside
the Secret Service?

476
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,334
Inside my detail?

477
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,506
Now, Bill's been briefing me,
of course, but...

478
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,514
this guy's your informant, right?

479
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,914
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand...

480
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,851
so let's make time at Camp David
to do that, all right?

481
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,320
Yes, sir.

482
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,865
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

483
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,867
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.

484
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,665
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.

485
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,240
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.

486
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,799
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.

487
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,210
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.

488
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,223
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?

489
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,455
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or...

490
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,464
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?

491
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:12,024
- What's his name? What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.

492
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,071
- Has he called you?
- Not yet. No.

493
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,802
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

494
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,104
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?

495
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,079
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?

496
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,979
- Well, that's a great idea. How was your flight?
- Short.

497
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,152
- <i>You guys all decent?</i>
- Afraid so.

498
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,754
Your informant's on the phone.

499
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,199
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash...

500
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,829
<i>and a legal document guaranteeing you</i>
<i>the rest once the traitor's apprehended.</i>

501
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,340
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.

502
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,241
<i>I'm not gonna start now.</i>
<i>Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.</i>

503
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,713
<i>Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.</i>

504
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:02,343
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.

505
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,250
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.

506
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,789
- <i>Drive fast.</i>
- Okay, you heard him. Let's go.

507
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,924
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.

508
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,462
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay. Got it.

509
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,624
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.

510
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,634
There's no way
we get surveillance in there.

511
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:22,263
Hold it. There's no way I'm gonna
let you go without a backup. No.

512
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,139
- Chaminski. Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.

513
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,655
At your 1:00.

514
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,993
<i>Watch your 3:00. Watch your 3:00.</i>

515
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,271
Check your 9:00.

516
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,012
Check your 9:00! Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!

517
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,226
Get down! Secret Service!
Get down!

518
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,766
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Agent down.

519
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,967
<i>Copy that. Breckinridge to Command.</i>

520
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,307
<i>We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.</i>
<i>Agent down.</i>

521
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:19,746
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.

522
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,251
<i>Command, copy that.</i>
<i>Available units en route. E.T.A. 20 minutes.</i>

523
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,302
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.

524
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,942
Heads.

525
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,978
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.

526
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,842
I'm a hundred yards south of you.

527
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,006
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.

528
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,347
- <i>Work your way towards me.</i>
- Copy that. Stagger off 10 feet.

529
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,689
Get out of here!

530
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,766
Take the point.

531
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,301
I don't have a visual!

532
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,340
Go!

533
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,483
<i>Garrison, Washington Command.</i>

534
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:11,755
<i>Additional agents and medical assist</i>
<i>are en route. Break. All units, be advised.</i>

535
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:15,889
<i>Shots fired, Allenwood Mall. One agent is down.</i>
<i>There are multiple civilian casualties.</i>

536
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,230
<i>Shooter is male,</i>
<i>blond hair, dark jacket.</i>

537
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,389
Pete. Pete!

538
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,663
You okay?

539
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,631
Do you have any idea why your informant
wanted to have you killed?

540
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,759
No. I'm wondering the same thing.

541
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,736
You might want to figure
that one out, Pete.

542
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,342
<i>Pete!</i>

543
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,438
Presidential helicopter
just went down.

544
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,742
<i>This is a news center special report.</i>

545
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:45,720
<i>The presidential helicopter,</i>
Marine One, <i>has crashed.</i>

546
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:50,282
Marine One,
<i>the presidential helicopter has gone down.</i>

547
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,419
<i>Whether or not the president</i>
<i>was on board has not...</i>

548
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,498
<i>Marine One,</i> the presidential
helicopter has crashed.

549
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,466
It happened just moments ago
about a half mile south of Camp David.

550
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,502
The chopper went down
in some densely wooded...

551
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:05,701
<i>We're now hearing reports</i>
<i>the president was not on board.</i>

552
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,403
<i>Actually, we can now confirm...</i>

553
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,412
<i>that neither the president</i>
<i>or the first lady...</i>

554
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,414
<i>were on board</i>
<i>at the time of the crash.</i>

555
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,451
<i>The president</i>
<i>and first lady are safe.</i>

556
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,885
<i>If you'rejustjoining us, these are live pictures</i>
<i>just outside Camp David...</i>

557
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,514
- <i>where earlier today,</i> Marine One...

558
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,718
<i>went down shortly after takeoff.</i>

559
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:28,321
<i>Two hikers who witnessed the crash</i>
<i>reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail...</i>

560
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,332
<i>just before that helicopter went down.</i>

561
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,426
<i>That is leading to the possibility,</i>
<i>unconfirmed by authorities...</i>

562
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,062
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- <i>that the chopper was shot down...</i>

563
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,073
<i>probably by a shoulder-fired missile.</i>

564
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,075
<i>Now, we want to make clear, again...</i>

565
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,908
- <i>that the president and first lady are safe.</i>

566
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,495
<i>If you are just joining us,</i>
<i>these are live pictures from the scene...</i>

567
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:05,694
<i>just outside of Camp David, where earlier today</i>
Marine One <i>went down just after takeoff.</i>

568
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,203
<i>Sources say marine and Secret Service</i>
<i>personnel were on that aircraft...</i>

569
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,002
<i>and they were killed in the crash.</i>

570
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,237
<i>This crash is being investigated</i>
<i>by both the White House and the military.</i>

571
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,213
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.

572
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,375
He wasn't on board.

573
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,854
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a...

574
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,425
Do you understand?

575
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,964
Now, we're gonna meet
and we're gonna discuss this.

576
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,330
Deadly against
any low-altitude aircraft...

577
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,803
including jets,
prop planes and helicopters.

578
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,466
<i>But that comes from witnesses.</i>

579
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,475
- <i>Has not been confirmed by investigators.</i>

580
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:51,809
- <i>Again, these pictures coming to us about...</i>

581
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:02,083
Well, it sure doesn't look like
you're here to bury the hatchet.

582
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,320
You're being investigated for treason.

583
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,956
- What are you talk...
- Step back.

584
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,399
- Excuse me?
- Step back.

585
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,101
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.

586
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,680
- Matt.
- Pete.

587
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,113
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.

588
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:32,012
If I failed the polygraph,
then why am I still on duty?

589
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,455
Director didn't want to arrest one of
the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life...

590
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,357
<i>without a little more evidence.</i>

591
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,930
How long you been working
for the Barranquilla Cartel?

592
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:45,297
What are you talking about?

593
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,463
- Hugo, can you come in here, please?

594
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:53,600
Pete Garrison,
Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.

595
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,304
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?</i>

596
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,541
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?

597
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,176
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?

598
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,050
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.

599
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,522
And that you almost missed
the <i>Marine One</i> flight yesterday.

600
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,786
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.

601
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,055
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.

602
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,690
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?

603
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,031
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop
for the Barranquilla Cartel.

604
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,129
<i>You screwed up, Pete.</i>
<i>You walked into a stakeout.</i>

605
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,333
I wanna know your number one
go-to guy at the cartel.

606
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:29,708
And I wanna know how you were gonna
help them kill the president.

607
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:34,079
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?

608
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:37,984
<i>To be honest with you, I don't care.</i>
<i>I know what the evidence is telling me.</i>

609
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,682
I have given my entire life
to the Secret Service.

610
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,090
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
Every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?

611
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,494
You're bitter after all your years of service
that they didn't make you director?

612
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:51,999
Oh, no. Don't confuse your own ambition
with mine. Okay, Dave?

613
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,502
Come on, Pete. Think about it.
People would understand that.

614
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:58,096
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet
for the president of the United States.

615
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,234
<i>And in the 25 years since,</i>
<i>you haven't even made shift supervisor...</i>

616
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,006
<i>on a presidential detail,</i>
<i>and that I know you wanted.</i>

617
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,844
<i>But they don't put guys</i>
<i>that bend the rules, not even a little bit...</i>

618
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,850
in charge of P.P.D., do they?

619
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,216
Even if they did take
a bullet for the old man.

620
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,017
<i>Is that your professional</i>
<i>or personal opinion?</i>

621
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,922
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.

622
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,723
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- <i>Has nothing to do with Cindy.</i>

623
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,024
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!

624
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,033
We're talking about it all the time,
even when we're not talking about it!

625
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,729
You can't look at me
without thinking about it!

626
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,397
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.

627
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,908
You think I wrecked your marriage,
and it has completely clouded your judgment.

628
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,410
I am following the evidence
and it is overwhelming.

629
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,971
The polygraph. Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to <i>Marine One.</i>

630
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,643
It was hit by a missile
for Christ's sake!

631
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,947
It was hit by a missile
because the flares...

632
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,319
and the four other countermeasures
were disengaged!

633
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,791
There was a hundred other people
who had access to it.

634
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,089
Explain to me
about the bank account.

635
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,395
- The what? The...
- <i>Your signature's all over the paperwork.</i>

636
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,992
I'm being framed.

637
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,834
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!

638
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,931
I'm the guy that initiated
this investigation.

639
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,306
Why would I do that
if I wanted to kill the president?

640
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,312
You initiated this investigation
for a traitor in our department...

641
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,848
so that when the assassination
actually took place...

642
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,850
<i>you'd be at the bottom</i>
<i>of the list of suspects.</i>

643
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:19,012
<i>I'm being framed!</i>
<i>Goddamn it! Just think about it.</i>

644
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:22,523
- You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!

645
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,094
The director just rolled up outside.

646
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,562
You better start thinking
about cooperating.

647
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,166
He's in the car.

648
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,526
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.

649
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,729
<i>Director's come all the way</i>
<i>down here to see me, huh?</i>

650
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:09,735
- That's very impressive.
- <i>It's embarrassing for us, sir.</i>

651
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,898
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really...

652
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,376
Garrison back door.

653
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,215
Oh, shit.

654
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,385
Pete!

655
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,984
Pete!

656
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,258
Where is he?

657
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,569
- Sorry.

658
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:49,370
This is Breckinridge. Garrison has escaped
from the rear of the residence into the alley.

659
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,874
Cordon off the area
and get back to me.

660
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,352
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.

661
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,549
He got your gun?
And your radio?

662
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,626
<i>What the hell are you</i>
<i>lookin'at her for?</i>

663
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,696
<i>She's been here two days.</i>
<i>How long have you been here?</i>

664
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,400
<i>Where to, mister?</i>

665
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,877
Just get me out of here.

666
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:45,627
<i>I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison</i>
<i>could be involved with something like this.</i>

667
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,796
<i>For most of you he's a friend,</i>
<i>to some, a legend.</i>

668
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,306
But the fact is, the evidence
against him is overwhelming.

669
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,845
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.

670
00:56:55,945 --> 00:57:00,279
<i>He is smarter and</i>
<i>more experienced than all of you.</i>

671
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,443
<i>You've never trained for this.</i>
<i>You are chasing your worst nightmare.</i>

672
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:07,114
<i>He knows how you think. He knows what</i>
<i>you know. And he knows how you operate.</i>

673
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,589
And he will use that against you.

674
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:13,651
He also knows that it's gonna be
very difficult for you...

675
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,460
to pull the trigger
if you have him in your sights.

676
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,594
So I want you to take a second
and visualize that.

677
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:27,540
<i>Because there is a very good chance</i>
<i>that is exactly how this is going to end.</i>

678
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,977
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure. Take it.

679
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,674
- Yeah?

680
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,785
<i>Fullback, Backstop. Do you have an arrival?</i>

681
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,950
<i>Backstop, Fullback. We have arrival.</i>

682
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,402
Backstop, go.

683
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,207
Cincinnati wrapping up. We're alpha for departure.

684
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:20,359
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean? I really literally do.

685
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,710
<i>He taps him on the back and the bear says...</i>

686
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,549
<i>"You didn't come here</i>
<i>to hunt, did ya?"</i>

687
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,749
<i>Get it? The bear.</i>

688
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,055
<i>That's not funny, man.</i>

689
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,927
<i>That joke ain't funny at all.</i>

690
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:15,110
- <i>Fullback. We're movin'.</i>
- <i>Roger that. We're set up.</i>

691
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,292
See you later, okay?
Be right back.

692
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,405
Thank you.

693
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:42,137
- Welke, DiPaola. Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.

694
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,001
Ma'am.

695
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,882
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.

696
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,784
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days,
I want you to know I was framed.

697
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,846
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

698
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,724
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?

699
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,797
I haven't figured that out yet.

700
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,957
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.

701
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:42,060
- Yes, you do. I'll go toJohn. I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.

702
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:47,768
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.

703
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,471
- You can cover my back.
- How?

704
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,414
The director has got a daily password
for the agents. Find out what it is.

705
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:25,603
- I'm checking through stuff.
- <i>Hey, guys. Garrison just used his cell phone.</i>

706
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,377
<i>He called Chez Doucette.</i>

707
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,851
You turned around
when it rang, didn't you?

708
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,016
Yeah, I did.

709
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,890
Ballsy. Very ballsy.

710
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,157
DiPaola said she seemed
completely unfazed.

711
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,564
She came upstairs, waited five minutes
and told him what happened.

712
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,397
Okay.

713
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,698
I'm just trying to understand
why he came here and why she reacted that way.

714
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,777
- This is your post?
- <i>Yeah, it is.</i>

715
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,072
Naturally, the first lady
doesn't want to believe...

716
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,808
the man protecting her
for the last eight months...

717
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,476
is trying to assassinate her husband.

718
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,917
That's why Pete came here.

719
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,387
He's looking for an ally.

720
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,789
And the first lady is
a very powerful ally to have.

721
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:22,028
Great. The idea is
to secure the entire site.

722
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:28,236
<i>I want you to get every stolen car report</i>
<i>for the entire area.</i>

723
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,904
Start looking for cars
that were taken within walking distance...

724
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,447
of the restaurant
or any of the nearby metro stations.

725
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:36,746
Then within those parameters,
I want you to isolate Accords...

726
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,822
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind
of car he's gonna steal?

727
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,857
<i>Those are the four most commonly</i>
<i>registered vehicles in the D.C. Area.</i>

728
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,223
<i>Pete knows that.</i>
<i>He's gonna want to blend in.</i>

729
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:48,957
<i>And the first thing he's gonna</i>
<i>want to do is find his informant.</i>

730
01:04:18,218 --> 01:04:21,881
If he tries to breach our computers,
we can find out where he's connecting from.

731
01:04:21,988 --> 01:04:24,388
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.

732
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,550
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?

733
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,094
Well, he'd need
that person's password.

734
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:33,359
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard
to get access to others' passwords.

735
01:04:33,466 --> 01:04:36,697
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.

736
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:39,465
We have his credit cards,
his cell phone.

737
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:42,735
<i>He has no other place to hide.</i>

738
01:04:54,487 --> 01:04:57,320
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

739
01:04:57,423 --> 01:05:01,826
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.

740
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:06,888
Oh, lovely boy,
but he been gone a long time.

741
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,630
- Well, this is the address
we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?

742
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:16,232
- Yes, ma'am. I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?

743
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:19,573
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.

744
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,147
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.

745
01:05:22,248 --> 01:05:25,979
Mrs. Miller. I'm remarried.

746
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:29,111
Would you have another address
or telephone number where I might reach him?

747
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:33,989
Oh, I'd love to help ya
get in touch with Walter.

748
01:05:34,093 --> 01:05:37,290
Bet he could use the money, but...

749
01:05:37,397 --> 01:05:40,127
I don't know where he is.

750
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:43,600
Walter and me haven't spoke
in three years.

751
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:47,195
Well, if you do talk to him,
tell him we got in touch.

752
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:49,741
Thank you, ma'am.

753
01:05:51,277 --> 01:05:53,711
Have a good day.

754
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:18,330
Leave a message.

755
01:06:18,438 --> 01:06:20,338
Walter, it's Mom.

756
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,537
A guy just come by the house
lookin' for ya. He's a cop.

757
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:39,251
On a gut level
it doesn't make sense.

758
01:07:39,352 --> 01:07:42,617
- The only thing this guy
cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?

759
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:46,055
Because he went out to the Academy
a few times and ran your field exercises?

760
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,151
Listen to me. Pete Garrison
was my best friend...

761
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:53,358
for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.

762
01:07:53,466 --> 01:07:58,233
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing
Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.

763
01:07:58,337 --> 01:08:00,498
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola...

764
01:08:00,606 --> 01:08:03,006
just signed in to our databases
using DiPaola's password.

765
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:08,103
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.

766
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:11,183
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.

767
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:44,778
- Walter!

768
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:32,093
<i>Notify Intel we've got a body.</i>

769
01:10:12,805 --> 01:10:15,865
Take the cars around
to the other side!

770
01:10:57,116 --> 01:10:59,084
Pete!

771
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,755
Pete!

772
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:18,460
Damn it.

773
01:11:50,603 --> 01:11:53,834
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.

774
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:57,500
- <i>Set up a perimeter now. Do you copy?</i>
- Copy that.

775
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,548
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.

776
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:07,448
<i>Get your men</i>
<i>to the back of the boat.</i>

777
01:12:17,596 --> 01:12:20,156
Pete, don't move!

778
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,848
Pete!

779
01:12:44,356 --> 01:12:47,416
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- <i>Fine.</i>

780
01:12:47,526 --> 01:12:50,256
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.

781
01:12:50,362 --> 01:12:54,230
- The only reason that I'm alive
is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.

782
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:56,563
- <i>No way!</i>
- Don't make me do this. Pete!

783
01:13:10,716 --> 01:13:13,116
You want to shoot me?

784
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:15,881
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!

785
01:13:15,988 --> 01:13:19,719
<i>Dave! My buddy!</i>

786
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,787
Come on! Shoot me!

787
01:13:23,896 --> 01:13:26,592
<i>Come on. Shoot me.</i>

788
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:03,497
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.

789
01:14:03,602 --> 01:14:04,603
I couldn't take the second shot.

790
01:14:04,603 --> 01:14:05,763
I couldn't take the second shot.

791
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,178
<i>What's the least</i>
<i>contained environment...</i>

792
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,443
- the president's going to be in
over the next few days?
- G8 Summit. Toronto.

793
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,814
It's a nightmare for us.

794
01:14:19,919 --> 01:14:22,979
Canadians are allowing the protestors
all the way up to the three perimeter.

795
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:27,115
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.

796
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,626
You really think it's him,
don't you?

797
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:57,822
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry. I can explain everything.

798
01:14:57,923 --> 01:15:00,790
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?

799
01:15:07,967 --> 01:15:12,927
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination
plot by one of the other agents...

800
01:15:13,038 --> 01:15:16,838
so I want to check his computer files,
see if there's any indication of evidence.

801
01:15:16,942 --> 01:15:19,206
Is that why there's a car
watching the house?

802
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:26,116
<i>The maroon Cadillac.</i>

803
01:15:26,218 --> 01:15:30,052
- <i>Who are they?</i>
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.

804
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:34,888
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys
to your car, and I want you to call the police.

805
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:37,895
<i>Not the Secret Service.</i>
<i>The police. Tell 'em about the Cadillac.</i>

806
01:15:37,997 --> 01:15:40,966
- Okay.
- Thanks.

807
01:16:40,592 --> 01:16:43,823
<i>I was waiting there maybe three hours.</i>
<i>Nobody showed up.</i>

808
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:46,159
<i>I didn't want</i>
<i>to stay there all day.</i>

809
01:16:46,265 --> 01:16:49,428
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.

810
01:16:52,805 --> 01:16:56,536
What do you want me to do?

811
01:16:56,642 --> 01:17:00,305
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.

812
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:02,846
Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no.

813
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:04,939
<i>What do you want?</i>

814
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:10,010
<i>I'm not gonna stay there all night.</i>
<i>She's not gonna be a problem.</i>

815
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:15,223
<i>No, no. No.</i>

816
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:17,693
<i>Yes, yes, by herself.</i>

817
01:17:17,796 --> 01:17:19,991
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

818
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:43,083
- Shooting. Shooting.

819
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:56,591
- Huh? Huh?
- Shooting!

820
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:03,104
Your name? Your name!

821
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:07,873
Who sent you? Who sent you!

822
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:34,534
Come on. Come on.

823
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:36,260
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?

824
01:19:36,368 --> 01:19:38,802
Yeah. Look, I just got into a shootout.

825
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:41,372
1265 Leslie, Northwest.

826
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:45,603
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.

827
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:50,705
He's got full security access
to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.

828
01:19:50,816 --> 01:19:54,946
<i>Okay, Pete. We're on it.</i>
<i>But I really think you should come in.</i>

829
01:19:55,053 --> 01:19:57,021
Yeah.

830
01:20:02,528 --> 01:20:06,624
Pete, we've been through the entire place,
but you're gonna have to be straight with me.

831
01:20:06,732 --> 01:20:09,792
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.

832
01:20:09,902 --> 01:20:13,065
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over...

833
01:20:13,172 --> 01:20:16,073
but there's no body, no passports,
no G8 credentials.

834
01:20:16,175 --> 01:20:19,474
Listen. This is not enough
to take back to Overbrook and clear you.

835
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:22,046
<i>Dave, I don't know</i>
<i>what to tell you.</i>

836
01:20:22,147 --> 01:20:25,913
They're gonna hit him
in Toronto, G8 Summit.

837
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:28,851
Pete. Pete?

838
01:20:31,823 --> 01:20:35,281
- Sarah?

839
01:20:35,394 --> 01:20:38,022
Listen, I'm leaving
for Toronto tonight.

840
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,122
Montrose wants to move me
up there early for security purposes.

841
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:43,224
- Oh!

842
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:49,337
California. My sister.
I'll call her back.

843
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:54,276
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm... I'm reasonably happy.

844
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:57,576
Maybe you could take a look
at that if you get a chance.

845
01:20:57,683 --> 01:21:01,380
<i>Sure. Then I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>I'll be up after the meeting.</i>

846
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:03,852
Okay. Thanks.

847
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,800
<i>One new message.</i>

848
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:20,998
<i>Sarah, I want you to know</i>
<i>if I don't make it, I was doing myjob.</i>

849
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:23,631
I've got to turn this off
before they track me.

850
01:21:23,742 --> 01:21:25,710
I love you.

851
01:21:31,817 --> 01:21:34,377
I want you to get the crime scene unit
out here immediately.

852
01:21:34,486 --> 01:21:37,387
- Rip this place apart. Find me something now.

853
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:39,423
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?

854
01:21:39,524 --> 01:21:42,925
Sarah Ballentine.

855
01:21:44,529 --> 01:21:46,497
<i>Come in.</i>

856
01:21:48,433 --> 01:21:51,800
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

857
01:21:51,903 --> 01:21:53,734
Thanks, Tom.

858
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:58,569
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

859
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:03,106
You know, most women
don't like whiskey...

860
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:06,946
but my mama was from Tennessee.

861
01:22:10,956 --> 01:22:13,516
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.

862
01:22:16,795 --> 01:22:20,697
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.

863
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:24,998
You know, I don't know
all the evidence you have against him...

864
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:28,300
but I do know why he failed
the lie detector test.

865
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:33,538
And I know why he was
in that coffee shop looking for someone.

866
01:23:17,656 --> 01:23:21,649
Hello. U.S. Secret Service
up for the G8.

867
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,320
I got a priority item
for the duty officer over at the lab.

868
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:28,422
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.

869
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:31,024
Sign the log, please.

870
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:41,512
I need any prints that
you can find off this cup.

871
01:23:41,613 --> 01:23:44,104
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

872
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:48,444
See you in about 12 minutes.

873
01:24:06,638 --> 01:24:09,198
<i>Sweeps two and three now complete.</i>

874
01:24:48,914 --> 01:24:51,382
I'm gonna be pushing
post in a few minutes...

875
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:53,576
- but if you want to grab a coffee...
- Marin.

876
01:24:53,685 --> 01:24:57,246
- Hey, Jill. This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.

877
01:24:57,355 --> 01:24:59,823
I'm sure they are.

878
01:24:59,925 --> 01:25:02,086
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No. Nothing.

879
01:25:02,194 --> 01:25:06,756
I did. You gotta help me out. If I e-mail
the prints to you, how long is it gonna take...

880
01:25:06,865 --> 01:25:09,527
to check them against the F.B.I.
And C.I.A. Databases?

881
01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:11,534
Five minutes after I receive 'em.

882
01:25:11,636 --> 01:25:15,265
I'll call you five minutes
after I send them. Bye.

883
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:18,103
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?

884
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,043
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.

885
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:49,271
In my experience a guilty man
doesn't break into a police station...

886
01:25:49,374 --> 01:25:51,706
and check fingerprints
for a few hours.

887
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,778
What do you think?

888
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,473
My phone was only on
for five minutes.

889
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:01,518
I was in the neighborhood.

890
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,886
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.

891
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:08,323
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.

892
01:26:08,426 --> 01:26:11,554
Oh, I know. The first lady.

893
01:26:11,663 --> 01:26:14,564
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.

894
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:17,499
She showed me the blackmail photos.

895
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:23,038
So where does that leave us?

896
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:27,339
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.

897
01:26:27,445 --> 01:26:29,572
Yeah.

898
01:26:29,681 --> 01:26:33,117
You really are an idiot,
you know that?

899
01:26:33,218 --> 01:26:37,655
- You honestly thought that
this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.

900
01:26:37,756 --> 01:26:39,690
Well, that's practical.

901
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:43,727
The prints belong
to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. <i>B...</i>

902
01:26:43,828 --> 01:26:48,060
now works for the personal security service
for the president of Karjastan.

903
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,600
I'm also showing confirmed intel
that this is the guy...

904
01:26:50,702 --> 01:26:53,034
<i>responsible for the Central Asian</i>
<i>pipeline attacks.</i>

905
01:26:53,138 --> 01:26:55,538
Confirmed intel on what,
Agent Marin?

906
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,939
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.

907
01:26:59,044 --> 01:27:01,706
- Yeah. Whatever.
- Thank you.

908
01:27:01,813 --> 01:27:05,044
These people have the financial
and intelligence resources to pull this off.

909
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:07,812
All right, let's get going.

910
01:27:10,822 --> 01:27:12,722
We've still gotta find the mole.

911
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:15,292
We polygraphed every agent
with access to the president.

912
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:17,520
Yours was the only one
that showed deception.

913
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:20,757
We need to figure out
how the real traitor passed the test.

914
01:27:20,865 --> 01:27:22,492
Montrose had the list.

915
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:28,205
You know I never guaranteed you success.

916
01:27:28,306 --> 01:27:30,206
Security's tighter than it's ever been.

917
01:27:30,308 --> 01:27:34,108
Routes, modes of transport,
they're all random now.

918
01:27:34,212 --> 01:27:36,510
<i>Yeah, but not random</i>
<i>to you, William.</i>

919
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:42,144
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter
at Camp David, you could have put him there.

920
01:27:44,022 --> 01:27:47,116
<i>Now, you've been playing us</i>
<i>since the beginning.</i>

921
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:49,921
<i>All right. Fair enough.</i>

922
01:27:50,028 --> 01:27:52,861
That's not gonna work anymore.

923
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:56,263
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.

924
01:27:56,368 --> 01:27:59,337
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B.,
which doesn't even exist anymore.

925
01:27:59,437 --> 01:28:01,997
Do you want out, William?

926
01:28:08,213 --> 01:28:11,478
Then give me... the president.

927
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,676
<i>Just like you agreed.</i>

928
01:28:13,785 --> 01:28:15,753
No.

929
01:28:17,889 --> 01:28:19,857
I don't care.

930
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,983
Expose me.

931
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:26,928
I don't care if I spend the rest
of my life in prison for treason.

932
01:28:27,032 --> 01:28:29,626
I don't care if you kill me.

933
01:28:32,303 --> 01:28:35,864
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.

934
01:28:39,911 --> 01:28:42,709
Oh. Thank you.

935
01:28:44,049 --> 01:28:47,485
William...

936
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:50,554
if you don't do this,
we're not gonna kill you.

937
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:01,227
We are going to kill her.

938
01:29:05,303 --> 01:29:07,567
And we're gonna kill her.

939
01:29:09,607 --> 01:29:11,575
And then we're gonna kill her.

940
01:29:22,387 --> 01:29:25,379
<i>Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.</i>

941
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:27,958
<i>But we're still here.</i>

942
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:33,355
<i>William, it's all right.</i>

943
01:29:33,465 --> 01:29:36,025
You do have a way out.

944
01:29:36,134 --> 01:29:38,102
But only one.

945
01:29:45,543 --> 01:29:48,569
When he finishes his speech,
you take him on the primary route...

946
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,376
to the "B" motorcade
under the plaza...

947
01:29:51,483 --> 01:29:53,815
and you take the radios out.

948
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:59,487
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.

949
01:30:02,393 --> 01:30:04,554
Hey, look.

950
01:30:07,966 --> 01:30:09,991
You can keep those.

951
01:30:10,101 --> 01:30:12,296
I got doubles.

952
01:30:19,844 --> 01:30:23,837
Jill, it's David. I want you to get
in touch with Downing and Medina.

953
01:30:23,948 --> 01:30:27,748
Confirm for me which one did
Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.

954
01:30:27,852 --> 01:30:31,413
- <i>We're on our way to city hall.</i>
- <i>Got it.</i>

955
01:30:38,763 --> 01:30:41,425
<i>Command Post from Apache follow-up.</i>

956
01:30:41,533 --> 01:30:44,093
<i>Arrive Martinez location</i>
<i>1740 hours. Copy.</i>

957
01:30:44,202 --> 01:30:46,932
<i>Summon security, DiPaola.</i>
<i>Cincinnati's moving to hold.</i>

958
01:30:47,038 --> 01:30:49,802
<i>All posts, all posts, be advised.</i>
<i>We have an arrival.</i>

959
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:53,810
<i>Only essential traffic at this time.</i>

960
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:01,050
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.

961
01:31:01,152 --> 01:31:04,121
Let's do this.

962
01:31:04,222 --> 01:31:06,520
- Yeah, tell me what you got.

963
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:10,560
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?

964
01:31:10,662 --> 01:31:14,860
Positive. Polygraphers have no record
of Montrose even being tested.

965
01:31:14,966 --> 01:31:17,628
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.

966
01:31:26,077 --> 01:31:29,478
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...

967
01:31:29,581 --> 01:31:31,879
America must be strong.

968
01:31:31,983 --> 01:31:33,883
But previous administrations...

969
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:36,453
I also hacked into
Merriweather's staff mail.

970
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:39,045
He was streaming
someone's offshore phone logs.

971
01:31:39,157 --> 01:31:41,648
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.

972
01:31:41,759 --> 01:31:43,590
Hi, Jill. It's Pete.

973
01:31:43,695 --> 01:31:47,222
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her...
only her... that it's Montrose.

974
01:31:47,332 --> 01:31:49,823
Got it.

975
01:31:49,934 --> 01:31:53,529
Jesus Christ, Pete. The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?

976
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:56,937
I never saw it coming, Dave.

977
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:31,872
<i>Be advised, they just allowed</i>
<i>two armed credentialed...</i>

978
01:32:31,976 --> 01:32:34,308
<i>American agents into the three perimeter</i>
<i>from checkpoint 386.</i>

979
01:32:34,412 --> 01:32:38,405
<i>Be advised, suspect Garrison</i>
<i>has just been let through...</i>

980
01:32:38,516 --> 01:32:40,575
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.

981
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:42,585
<i>Ah, Jesus! I got Garrison</i>
<i>through the three.</i>

982
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:46,453
<i>This resolution cannot</i>
<i>function alone. It is designed...</i>

983
01:32:46,557 --> 01:32:49,651
It's Garrison and Breck.

984
01:32:49,761 --> 01:32:52,491
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!

985
01:32:52,597 --> 01:32:56,158
<i>I'm Agent Breckinridge.</i>
<i>I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.</i>

986
01:32:56,267 --> 01:32:58,565
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?

987
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:02,299
<i>We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.</i>

988
01:33:02,407 --> 01:33:06,810
- We must embrace the ideal
of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.

989
01:33:09,414 --> 01:33:12,144
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.

990
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,411
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.

991
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:16,077
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!

992
01:33:16,187 --> 01:33:18,087
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?

993
01:33:18,189 --> 01:33:20,384
What's the procedure for that?

994
01:33:22,727 --> 01:33:25,696
<i>No unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>beyond the two perimeter.</i>

995
01:33:25,797 --> 01:33:27,765
Ma'am.

996
01:33:30,468 --> 01:33:33,028
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.

997
01:33:33,137 --> 01:33:35,435
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.

998
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,770
- <i>I'm not hearing any chatter.</i>
- I've got silence on all channels.

999
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:40,537
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.

1000
01:33:40,645 --> 01:33:43,944
He wanted me to tell you
that Montrose is the mole.

1001
01:33:46,017 --> 01:33:50,613
<i>But I strongly believe that we can</i>
<i>protect our vital interests...</i>

1002
01:33:50,722 --> 01:33:53,316
<i>without causing resentment.</i>

1003
01:33:53,424 --> 01:33:56,120
- Get your hands in the air!

1004
01:33:56,227 --> 01:33:59,788
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!

1005
01:33:59,897 --> 01:34:02,491
- <i>You are a Do Not Admit!</i>
- But at the same time...

1006
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,001
- Mr. President.
- <i>Listen to me!</i>

1007
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:08,834
<i>Do not let him</i>
<i>move the president!</i>

1008
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,908
This way, Mr. President.

1009
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:13,739
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!

1010
01:34:13,845 --> 01:34:16,712
Crystal. Crystal is the password.

1011
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:22,715
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.

1012
01:34:27,158 --> 01:34:29,649
It's all right.

1013
01:34:29,761 --> 01:34:33,754
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?

1014
01:34:33,865 --> 01:34:37,062
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.

1015
01:34:41,172 --> 01:34:43,231
This way.

1016
01:34:47,545 --> 01:34:51,072
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?

1017
01:34:51,182 --> 01:34:54,174
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.

1018
01:34:58,056 --> 01:35:00,524
That's a hell of a way
to leave the G8.

1019
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:04,459
<i>What is going on</i>
<i>with these goddamn radios?</i>

1020
01:35:12,537 --> 01:35:15,233
Go in twos.

1021
01:35:19,577 --> 01:35:23,240
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?

1022
01:35:23,347 --> 01:35:26,145
- <i>What's next?</i>
- Bill?

1023
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,310
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.

1024
01:35:40,064 --> 01:35:42,396
Crystal!

1025
01:35:45,136 --> 01:35:48,731
<i>Pete, we're cut off</i>
<i>from the "B" motorcade.</i>

1026
01:36:13,631 --> 01:36:16,532
You okay?

1027
01:36:16,634 --> 01:36:18,534
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.

1028
01:36:18,636 --> 01:36:20,627
What?

1029
01:36:20,738 --> 01:36:24,606
Your locator, turn it off. That's how
they know where we are. They're tracking us.

1030
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:28,611
How do you...
How do you know?

1031
01:36:31,749 --> 01:36:35,378
Oh, no, Bill. Oh, God.

1032
01:36:54,405 --> 01:36:57,101
<i>Montrose was...</i>

1033
01:37:22,366 --> 01:37:25,233
<i>Pete. Pete.</i>

1034
01:37:25,336 --> 01:37:28,066
My family. My family. Pete!

1035
01:37:33,077 --> 01:37:35,545
Mr. President,
you're gonna have to trust us.

1036
01:37:35,646 --> 01:37:38,171
<i>We're gonna get you</i>
<i>up top to an evac car.</i>

1037
01:37:57,969 --> 01:38:00,995
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high. You go low. You ready?

1038
01:38:01,105 --> 01:38:02,936
- Yeah.
- <i>Go.</i>

1039
01:38:12,216 --> 01:38:15,276
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.

1040
01:38:31,936 --> 01:38:34,928
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.

1041
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:37,564
Yes. Garrison.

1042
01:38:37,675 --> 01:38:40,610
<i>Need a hard car for</i>
<i>the president at southwest two.</i>

1043
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:42,941
Coming to you, Pete.
Go. Go! Go, go!

1044
01:38:43,047 --> 01:38:45,447
<i>Southwest stairs.</i>
<i>Let's go get 'em!</i>

1045
01:38:45,549 --> 01:38:47,744
All right, we're gonna
get you out of here.

1046
01:39:41,138 --> 01:39:45,165
<i>Give me a perimeter</i>
<i>10 meters, 360 degrees!</i>

1047
01:39:58,989 --> 01:40:01,150
<i>President's hard car!</i>
<i>Let's get him in!</i>

1048
01:40:01,258 --> 01:40:05,058
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.

1049
01:40:23,381 --> 01:40:25,747
<i>The president is away!</i>

1050
01:40:32,556 --> 01:40:34,353
Go, go, go, go!

1051
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:42,131
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

1052
01:40:47,571 --> 01:40:50,404
- <i>Secure the first lady!</i>
- <i>We need a hard car, now!</i>

1053
01:41:20,004 --> 01:41:22,063
Carl.

1054
01:41:22,173 --> 01:41:25,142
Listen, Pete, um...

1055
01:41:28,179 --> 01:41:30,079
You take care of yourself.

1056
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:34,677
I'll save you a tee time.

1057
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:39,988
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.

1058
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,990
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

1059
01:41:42,092 --> 01:41:45,425
I'll see you guys. Good careers.

1060
01:41:45,529 --> 01:41:48,054
Take care.

1061
01:41:48,165 --> 01:41:50,292
Do well, guys. See you soon.

1062
01:41:50,401 --> 01:41:53,336
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?

1063
01:41:54,705 --> 01:41:57,196
- This could be trouble.

1064
01:41:57,308 --> 01:42:01,972
- I'm gonna walk out of the
White House carrying this?

1065
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,048
Thanks, guys.

1066
01:42:06,383 --> 01:42:09,045
- Bye-bye. All the best.
- <i>Hey, Pete!</i>

1067
01:42:09,153 --> 01:42:11,178
You gonna leave
without saying good-bye?

1068
01:42:11,288 --> 01:42:13,722
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.

1069
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:15,815
Thanks.

1070
01:42:15,926 --> 01:42:18,019
So, how about
a little retirement dinner tonight?

1071
01:42:18,128 --> 01:42:20,892
I can't. I got a date.

1072
01:42:20,998 --> 01:42:24,331
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.

1073
01:42:24,435 --> 01:42:26,528
That's great.

1074
01:42:26,637 --> 01:42:29,629
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.

1075
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,334
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.

1076
01:42:35,346 --> 01:42:37,974
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

1077
01:42:38,082 --> 01:42:40,642
It's gonna miss you too.

1078
01:42:44,021 --> 01:42:46,819
Take care.
