1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,571
(elegant orchestral music)

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,512
(door thuds)

3
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,682
(footsteps pattering)

4
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,488
(ominous orchestral music)

5
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,865
(door clatters)

6
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,434
(door thuds)

7
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,637
Name?

8
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,538
[Ed] Ed.

9
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,407
Is that it? Just Ed?

10
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,308
Edward.

11
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,344
Edward Chilton.

12
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,780
Edward Chilton.

13
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:33,920
Well, now, we have quite
a file here, don't we, Ed?

14
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,856
Are we proud of it?

15
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,460
Ah, I should think not.

16
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,567
It says here that you cut
your mother's head off.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,468
Is that right?

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,806
So you're a mother killer.

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,375
That's your game, eh, Edward?

20
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,744
No.

21
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,878
Absolutely not.

22
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,413
Well, excuse my conjecture,

23
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,849
but I think if you cut
her head off,

24
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,885
it sort of follows that you
killed her, does it not?

25
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,655
No, sir.

26
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,856
She was already dead.

27
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:21,367
You cut your mother's
head off after she was dead?

28
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,810
Son, you are one
sick individual.

29
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,816
Your Honor,

30
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,422
this whole case that my
esteemed colleague

31
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,925
is attempting to build
is nothing but a sham!

32
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:52,632
Now, I have here a letter that
will prove, once and for all,

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,269
that my client is innocent.

34
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:02,008
Innocent as a white lamb
suckling against its mother.

35
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,714
Innocent as a fresh fall of
snow on a forest of pine.

36
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,853
Innocent as a newborn babe
nestling in his mother's arms.

37
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:20,326
Innocent as a 15 year old
virgin covered in honey,

38
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,798
her nipples pert and erect,

39
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,837
topping a pair of supple
but not yet quite formed--

40
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,806
(gavel banging)

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,808
Would you just show
me the letter?

42
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,410
[Mr. Abner] Oh, yes,
the letter.

43
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,647
How did I ever get
myself into this?

44
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,451
(sexy music)

45
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,594
Sex, that's what
it's all about.

46
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,132
From the onset of puberty,

47
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,669
what occupies 90% of our time?

48
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,406
The pursuit of sex, right?

49
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:11,944
Ed,

50
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,514
sex is life,

51
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,554
and if it was a pronoun,
she'd be it.

52
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,658
Our new neighbor is some
piece of work.

53
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,365
(sighs)

54
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,600
I'm doing this for your benefit.

55
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,469
You could at least
feign excitement.

56
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,840
Have you heard anything
I've been saying here?

57
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,979
Another perfectly good
lecture gone to waste.

58
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:53,920
Ed, you got to start
putting this behind you.

59
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,791
Uncle Benny, she was my
mother, and I miss her.

60
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,926
Is that so terrible?

61
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,597
No, no, that's fine, that's
great, that's wonderful,

62
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,032
but the fact remains

63
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,803
that you're here and she's dead.

64
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:13,873
Gone.

65
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,774
Buried.

66
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,642
Kaput.

67
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,577
Deceased.

68
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,213
- Pushing up the daisies.
- I get the idea.

69
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,114
Do you?

70
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,181
You don't act like it.

71
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,051
You've gotta start
forgetting her.

72
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,022
Hey, you got $60,000 from
her insurance.

73
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,692
That pretty much would
covered my grief on anybody.

74
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,130
I just find it a little
hard to get along without her.

75
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,131
A little hard?

76
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,200
Ed, you're dysfunctional.

77
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,136
I am not!

78
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,938
I'm a normal son mourning the
loss of his beloved mother.

79
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,541
For almost a year.

80
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,776
I didn't mourn the wreck

81
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,211
of my first Studebaker
for that long.

82
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,246
I don't think it Studebaker

83
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,481
is on the same level as Mother.

84
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,083
Besides, I made her a promise.

85
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,251
Big deal!

86
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,653
You lie, I do it all the time.

87
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,155
Hey, do you think that
she's gonna know

88
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,923
the difference anyway?

89
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,491
That's not the point.

90
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,827
Ed, mothers were made
to be lied to.

91
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,166
You didn't act this way
when your father died.

92
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,200
That was 10 years ago.

93
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,104
Besides, I wasn't exactly
his favorite person.

94
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,206
Your father loved you dearly.

95
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,641
He hated my guts.

96
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,110
Hate's kind of a strong word.

97
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,245
Always called me Junior.

98
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,782
And he always wore that stupid
hat just to annoy Mother.

99
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,684
I kinda liked his hat.

100
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,753
[Ed] Ho, I'm gonna be
late for work.

101
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,755
You own the place!

102
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,923
What are you gonna do,
fire yourself

103
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,524
if you're five minutes late?!

104
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,126
Not me.

105
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,296
Mother's the one who
can't tolerate tardiness.

106
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,864
Ed, she's dead.

107
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,733
Quit talking about her
in the present tense!

108
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,605
(gentle music)

109
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,817
(bell rings)

110
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,985
Morning, Big Lar.

111
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,053
[Lar] Good morning.

112
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:07,920
Thanks for opening up.

113
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,255
I'm running a little late.

114
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,224
No problem, Mr. Chilton.

115
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,291
Can you, uh...

116
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,561
Thanks.

117
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,566
- Mr. Chilton?
- (bell rings)

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,734
- [Ed] Yeah?
- I picked up this

119
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,270
new brochure from
America's Best.

120
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,040
Their line of mulching mowers
has been totally revamped.

121
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:29,842
They're looking good.

122
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,044
We've been through
this already, Big Lar.

123
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,247
Side discharge mowing was
good enough for Mother,

124
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,648
it's good enough for us.

125
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,752
Maybe she was wrong
about this, Mr. Chilton.

126
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,255
Things change, you know?

127
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,324
I've been looking around.

128
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,194
Mulching mowers are
selling real good all over.

129
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,662
The decisions been made.

130
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,863
I don't wanna discuss it.

131
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,732
(phone rings)

132
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,200
Chilton Hardware.

133
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,903
Tool for every need,
a need for every tool.

134
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,170
(bell rings)

135
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,038
Mm-hm.

136
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,107
The longest blades we got,
13 inches.

137
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,210
Oh, I surely think
you could slice

138
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,946
your cheating whore of
a wife in two with it.

139
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:07,847
Mm-hm.

140
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,049
Well, that'd work too.

141
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,152
Of course, a chainsaw is gonna
cost you quite a bit more.

142
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:14,954
Mm-hm.

143
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,925
Well, whenever you decide,
you drop on by.

144
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,861
God bless you too.

145
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,896
Reverend Praxton again?

146
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,331
[Man] Good morning.

147
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,266
[Lar] Good morning, sir.

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,102
I'm looking for the owner
of this fine establishment.

149
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,405
That'd be Mr. Chilton.

150
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,040
Ed Chilton?

151
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,141
[Lar] That's right.

152
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,342
Thank you.

153
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,643
Excuse me, gentlemen.

154
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,183
May I help you?

155
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,852
Well, now, Mr. Chilton,
I believe you may.

156
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,121
Or rather, I think we may
be able to help each other.

157
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,323
My name is Pattle.

158
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,858
AJ Pattle, the Happy
People Corporation

159
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,960
of Webster City, Iowa.

160
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,927
Heard of us?

161
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,195
Not many people have.

162
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,198
We sort of cater to a
select clientele,

163
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,032
if you know what I mean.

164
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,734
Is there some place
we could talk?

165
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,902
Right here is fine with me.

166
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,105
Uh, I was thinking of
someplace a bit more private.

167
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,741
What I'm selling ain't
exactly hardware.

168
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,010
Is it illegal fireworks?

169
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,445
Because I could tell
you right now, mister,

170
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,746
I'm not interested.

171
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,780
Nothing illegal.

172
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,416
And you are gonna be interested.

173
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,989
Back here.

174
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,193
Have a seat.

175
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,400
Well?

176
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,770
Edward Joseph Chilton,

177
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,808
your mother died almost a
year ago, and you miss her.

178
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,477
Well, that's only natural,

179
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,380
seeing as how you're such
a mama's boy and all.

180
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,882
No, I mean that in the
best possible sense.

181
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,319
Just what are you selling?

182
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,320
Life.

183
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,789
Life?

184
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,224
- Insurance?
- Not insurance.

185
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,326
Just plain life.

186
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,928
Fun, joy, dancing in
the moonlight,

187
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,763
you know, that kinda stuff.

188
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:10,202
Ed, what if I told you that
for a mere thousand dollars,

189
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,273
life can be yours?

190
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,275
A thousand dollars for life.

191
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,413
Almost too good to be
true, wouldn't you say?

192
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,250
But I'm already alive.

193
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,151
Not you.

194
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,186
Your mother.

195
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,823
- Mother?
- Yes.

196
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,426
For a thousand bucks, we'll
bring her back to life.

197
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,593
Back to life?

198
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,530
Ed, this isn't the Second
Coming we're talking here.

199
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,464
It's a simple reanimation.

200
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,632
We do it all the time.

201
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,401
You know, we've got a customer
list as long as your arm.

202
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,204
Farmers, poets, politicians,
rock stars,

203
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,138
we've dealt with them all.

204
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,042
Did you know that some of
the top people in Washington

205
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,477
have been dead for years?

206
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,347
Oh, this is nuts.

207
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,455
No, no, I'm sorry, I
think you better leave.

208
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,024
Well, this isn't
for everybody.

209
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,560
You don't want your
mother back alive.

210
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,161
That's certainly your option.

211
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,198
Wait, wait.

212
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,068
Did you say that I don't
have to pay a penny

213
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,504
until you bring
Mother home alive?

214
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,538
It's guaranteed.

215
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,309
(gentle music)

216
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,146
(bird chirping)

217
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,783
(knocking)

218
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,358
(knocking)

219
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,838
(knocking)

220
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,951
What in tarnation's going on?

221
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:13,959
Morning, Ed.

222
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,595
I'll get right back to you.

223
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:19,999
It's nobody, just go
back to bed.

224
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,601
- But I thought that I saw--
- Go back to bed!

225
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,936
- I--
- Now!

226
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,837
[Benny] Jeez.

227
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,909
The boy gets more like
his mother every day.

228
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,348
It's 5:30 in the morning.

229
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,318
Yup, it's 5:30.

230
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,186
You're right.

231
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,122
- What do you want?
- (rooster crowing)

232
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,157
(sighs)

233
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,594
Something wrong?

234
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,034
Ed, why don't you come
over to my car a second?

235
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,074
What happened?

236
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,146
Did you get Mother?

237
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,082
You didn't get her, did you?

238
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,152
Oh, your mother's right here.

239
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,120
(sighs)

240
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,655
You put my mother
in the trunk?

241
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,157
Well, jeez, Ed, she's dead.

242
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,326
You think I wanna get
her all over my seats?

243
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,394
Let me see her.

244
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,164
I don't know, Ed,
she's been dead a while.

245
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:25,698
It's not real pretty.

246
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,632
I wanna see her.

247
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,539
(groans)

248
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,641
Oh my god, she's in pieces!

249
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,409
[AJ] Well, that's kind
of the problem.

250
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,410
(coughing)

251
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,712
[Ed] Why'd you cut her up?!

252
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,247
That's how we found her.

253
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,949
She donate some of her
organs or something?

254
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,417
[Ed] Well, she donated some

255
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,020
to the Oy Gevalt
School of Medicine.

256
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,054
Mother was big on education.

257
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,157
Well, that's nice, but
this, this is a disaster.

258
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,194
It's like putting a car
together without a transmission.

259
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,462
[Ed] Can't you do something?

260
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,463
I don't know, Ed.

261
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,266
I mean, oh, here, look at this.

262
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,737
If we reanimate with her
brain like this,

263
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,372
she's gonna be good
for slobbering

264
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,141
and watching Married With
Children and that's about it.

265
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,443
(Ed groans)

266
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,280
It's hardly worth the effort.

267
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,414
(groans)

268
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,615
Wait, wait, you have
to do something.

269
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,316
We made a deal.

270
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,217
Oh, we're pretty backed up.

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,586
A job like this will take
a lot of time.

272
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,055
Now, we'd be talking some
real money to do it right.

273
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,324
(Ed groans)

274
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,360
We agreed on a price.

275
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,728
I'm not paying you a penny more.

276
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,033
Ed, you don't have to
put down one red cent.

277
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,034
And despite all the trouble,

278
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,403
I'm gonna make it worth
every penny to you.

279
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,571
I'll even take the rush
charges on the cuff.

280
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,640
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

281
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,176
Just that when your mother
does come back to life

282
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,745
and you're perfectly
satisfied she's all right,

283
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,748
it's gonna cost, um, 3,500.

284
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,621
We agreed on a thousand.

285
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,456
Aw, come on, Ed,
be reasonable.

286
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,491
You didn't tell me she
was chopped to pieces.

287
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,060
You couldn't have done a
much better job

288
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,128
if you'd run her through
a sausage grinder.

289
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,164
And to top it off, half
her organs are missing.

290
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,366
You know how hard it is to
find a replacement kidney

291
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,203
for a 1936 two-legged
Caucasian female?

292
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,204
2,500.

293
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,539
2,500?

294
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,608
That doesn't even cover
my gas to drive here.

295
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,577
I might as well stick
her back in the grave

296
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,346
and put a rock on her.

297
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,480
Take it or leave it.

298
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,717
All right.

299
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,285
But I gotta have a
thousand upfront.

300
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,520
My company will throw
this out the door,

301
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,788
but if I have your
check in hand,

302
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,290
it's not a lot they can do.

303
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,595
Wait here.

304
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,602
But I want her alive and back
at the house tomorrow night

305
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,771
by midnight or else
the deal's off.

306
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,473
(chuckles)

307
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,774
You drive a hard bargain.

308
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,810
My mother was a hardware man.

309
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,513
She taught me it's better
to be a hammer than a nail.

310
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,257
Thank you, God.

311
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,325
Thank you.

312
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,694
(sexy music)

313
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,363
Great.

314
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,264
Great.

315
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,668
All right.

316
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,103
A week.

317
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,341
No, make that a month, a
month of going to church

318
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,209
if you'll just make a
turn around.

319
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,280
Do it.

320
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,115
Please.

321
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,617
Turn around.

322
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,454
Uncle Benny?

323
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,660
Oh, there you are.

324
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,896
I thought maybe you'd
gone to bed.

325
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,664
Why, thanks, Ed.

326
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,334
I don't mind if I do miss the
opportunity of a lifetime.

327
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,170
What?

328
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,538
Never mind.

329
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,377
What are you all dolled up for?

330
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,712
No reason.

331
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,715
Shouldn't you be off to bed?

332
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,817
You look really tired.

333
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,120
[Benny] It's only
nine o'clock.

334
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,458
[Ed] This place is a mess.

335
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,126
You got somebody coming over?

336
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,695
Why do you say that?

337
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,267
It's a girl, isn't it?

338
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,336
Guess my little talk did
some good, huh?

339
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,307
So you have protection?

340
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,943
Shield that gator, no
regrets later.

341
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:31,777
Uncle Benny.

342
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,644
I'm your uncle.

343
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,614
It's my job to ask you
these questions.

344
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,418
Now, look, you want me to
hide in the kitchen and watch?

345
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,753
That way I can call
out suggestions

346
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,789
in case you get stuck on
what to do next?

347
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,357
This isn't what you think.

348
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,658
I don't--
I understand.

349
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,460
You're shy.

350
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,430
You want some privacy.

351
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,432
Forget I even asked.

352
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,569
I'll just wish you well
and toddle off to bed.

353
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,544
But if she should prove to
be more than you can handle,

354
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,712
I'll be right up here.

355
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,356
(gentle music)

356
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,340
(knocking)

357
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,947
[Ed] Mother?

358
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,584
No.

359
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,487
Oh, I'm sorry, I was
expecting someone else.

360
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,589
Disappointed?

361
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,392
No, not at all.

362
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,603
I was just coming home
and I saw your light on,

363
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,807
so I thought I'd come
over and introduce myself.

364
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,708
[Ed] Oh.

365
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:11,810
My name is Storm.

366
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,315
As in electrical.

367
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,385
I'm Ed Chilton.

368
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,422
I own Chilton's Hardware
over on 4th and Union.

369
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,625
Say, if you need any locks
and bolts or anything,

370
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,659
just give me a holler.

371
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,395
I've also got a whole new
line of snap-on tools.

372
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,332
I've seen you watching me.

373
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,603
No, um, that's not mine.

374
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,939
I mean, that's not me.

375
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,840
I, uh...

376
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,979
I like it when you watch me.

377
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,549
You like to have
people watch you?

378
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,585
No, not people.

379
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,320
Just you.

380
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,425
Are you sure you have
the right neighbor?

381
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,428
Positive.

382
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,700
Is this some kind of a joke?

383
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,077
Does it seem like a joke?

384
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,080
No, ma'am, it sure doesn't.

385
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,899
[Storm] Do you want me?

386
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,005
Yes or no?

387
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,685
Yes.

388
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,591
(tires screech)
Mm, oh.

389
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,459
Did I say yes?

390
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,927
- I meant no.
- What?

391
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,964
Um, well, uh, let me
qualify that.

392
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,566
I mean no as in not right now.

393
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,535
But some other time, big yes.

394
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,037
You don't mind leaving
by the backdoor, do you?

395
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,406
Wait, Ed, there's a
nine-foot fence out there.

396
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,575
[Ed] Well, get a good run,
you should be able to clear it.

397
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,812
(knocking)

398
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,816
(knocking)

399
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,788
(doorbell chimes)

400
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,056
[Woman] Eddie, I'm home!

401
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,559
Mother?

402
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,061
Is it really you?

403
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,731
Yes, Eddie, it's really me!

404
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,835
This is my favorite
part of the job.

405
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,672
Oh, this nice man gave
me a ride home.

406
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,041
Give him a tip, dear,
so he can be on his way.

407
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,809
I'll settle for my check.

408
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,710
[Ed] Oh.

409
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,580
Oh my goodness!

410
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,650
I know just what's been
going on here.

411
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,551
[Ed] You do?

412
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,754
What mother worth her
salt wouldn't?

413
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,055
Oh, could you make this out

414
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,890
to the Happy People Corporation?

415
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,725
It wasn't my fault, Mother.

416
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,893
I just opened the door
and she was--

417
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,062
I know it wasn't your fault,
Eddie.

418
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,864
It was Uncle Benny's fault.

419
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,465
He's been spying on the
neighbors again.

420
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,735
Thought I got rid of this
thing years ago.

421
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,804
Oh, no!

422
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,039
Who's been putting
their feet up on a sofa?

423
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,043
Well, I can see you two
have a lot to talk about,

424
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,845
so I'll be on my way.

425
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,986
Uh, thank you, Mr. Pattle.

426
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,791
[Mother] Eddie dear, your
milk and cookies are ready!

427
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,696
(gentle music)

428
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,644
(yawns)

429
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,612
Morning, Uncle Benny.

430
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,616
Ed, your mother's in
the refrigerator.

431
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,062
Oh, good morning, dear.

432
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,898
Are you ready for your
cranberry juice?

433
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,901
Thank you.

434
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,970
(chuckles)

435
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,806
(mother humming)

436
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,784
What am I gonna do?

437
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,688
Ed, I got up this
morning, got the newspaper,

438
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,258
poured my Corn Flakes,
opened the refrigerator.

439
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,629
You can well imagine my surprise

440
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,232
when I saw your mother sitting
there feeling potatoes.

441
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,236
I'm having a little
trouble dealing with this,

442
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,939
so give me just a minute, okay?

443
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,176
[Mother] I hope you
didn't dig to the bottom

444
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,012
of the Corn Flakes for the
prize like you always do!

445
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,147
And that reminds me, Benny,

446
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,884
have you been putting
your feet up on the sofa?

447
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,619
It's absolutely filthy!

448
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:24,089
Ed, this is a
goddamn nightmare!

449
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,123
Benny!

450
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,360
I will not have that sort
of talk in this house!

451
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,561
Shut the door!

452
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,268
You brought her back,
didn't you?

453
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,204
Don't be silly, she was dead,
how could I bring her back?

454
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,873
I don't know, but
it makes sense.

455
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,777
You're the one that
wanted her back.

456
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,678
You're the one who's
always crying

457
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,914
about how you couldn't
live without her.

458
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,716
Did you publish one of
those prayers

459
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,885
to Saint Jude in the
paper again?

460
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,754
Is that how you did this?

461
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,288
[Mother] Benny?

462
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,289
What?!

463
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,058
[Mother] Shut up and
eat your Corn Flakes!

464
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,231
Ed, listen to me!

465
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,667
This is not meant to be.

466
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,036
It's just not right!

467
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,338
This is morally wrong!

468
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,840
(loud thud)

469
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,979
Where the hell is my telescope?!

470
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:28,920
Hi, Ed.

471
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:31,990
Hi there.

472
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,728
I wanted to apologize
for last night.

473
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,433
I got a little lonely
and had a couple drinks.

474
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,369
Oh, please, I'm the one who
should be apologizing to you

475
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,071
for rushing you out that way.

476
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,807
[Storm] Maybe we
could have dinner.

477
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,276
Really?

478
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,044
Uh, sure.

479
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,045
(chuckles)

480
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:54,946
Tonight?

481
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,683
Actually, I can't tonight.

482
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,052
We're having a little
trouble with Mother.

483
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,454
She's not feeling too good.

484
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,356
Oh, I'm sorry.

485
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,391
It's probably the heat.

486
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,093
Yeah, that could be.

487
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,831
(Ed sighs)

488
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,036
Um, I should be
getting off to work.

489
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:20,872
So...

490
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,847
I have a car.

491
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,349
(both chuckle)

492
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,955
(clattering)

493
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,856
Benny.

494
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:43,928
What are you doing?

495
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,902
Boy, this takes the
frosting right off my cake.

496
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,103
(groans)

497
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:55,173
I guess hiding it wasn't enough,
huh?

498
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,475
Had to destroy the damn thing.

499
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,376
Give it to me.

500
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,479
Give it to me!

501
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,150
Oh.

502
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,220
(bell rings)

503
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,121
Afternoon.

504
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,391
[Man] Good afternoon.

505
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,063
Excuse me, sir, what...

506
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,466
Oh my god.

507
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,035
There's nobody out there.

508
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,070
(chuckles)

509
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,939
Hardly pays to stay
open anymore.

510
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:02,807
Oh, Edward.

511
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,114
[Ed] What are you doing out?

512
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,149
I thought you got 10 years.

513
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,884
Time off for good behavior.

514
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,420
Hell, I'm a model citizen.

515
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,021
(chuckles)

516
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:17,922
Oh.

517
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:25,930
Mm.

518
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,268
Where's your mom?

519
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,537
She's not here.

520
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,471
Oh, too bad.

521
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,506
I wanted to see her.

522
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:40,145
You know, she should
never had sent me away,

523
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,113
should never have pressed
those charges against me.

524
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,482
That was a stupid thing to do.

525
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,952
You were stealing from us.

526
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,054
(laughs)

527
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,289
I steal from everyone.

528
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,225
You don't see them getting all
hyper about it, now do you?

529
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,126
Hm?

530
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,464
Mother did what was right.

531
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,900
(chuckles)

532
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,036
You see, Edward,

533
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,142
sometimes when you do what's
right, do what's right,

534
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,179
you have to pay the price.

535
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,980
(grunts)

536
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,349
(loud crash)

537
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,587
Does that make sense?!

538
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,592
So where is she?

539
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,262
Well, I'll be darned.

540
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,231
Rob Sundheimer.

541
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,366
Has it been 10 years already?

542
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,238
Boy, time sure does pass.

543
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,544
How's your little
brother Timmy doing?

544
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,046
He's still going to school?

545
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,916
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's over
in college over at Ames.

546
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,084
He's doing real well.

547
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,220
Good for him.

548
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,355
I bet your mom's real happy

549
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:01,292
that at least one of you is
gonna amount to something.

550
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,594
Yeah, well, she's real proud.

551
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,494
We all are.

552
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,365
Well,

553
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,237
I guess I better skedaddle.

554
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,472
(chuckles)

555
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,546
Say hi to your mom, Ed.

556
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,022
Boy, oh, boy, I'd sure hate

557
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,091
to be in your shoes, Mr.
Chilton.

558
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,426
(chuckles)

559
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,564
One day, a cow mooed at
him the wrong way,

560
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,133
whack, right between the eyes.

561
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,636
(chuckles)

562
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,070
Darnedest thing.

563
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,008
(television chattering)

564
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,009
Mother, I'm home!

565
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,012
My god.

566
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,117
Uncle Benny!

567
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,485
Uncle Benny, what happened?

568
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,253
She just collapsed.

569
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,655
What are we gonna do?

570
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,123
Guess we'll have
to rebury her.

571
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,259
Do you think we'll have
to get another plot

572
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,428
or will they let us
use the same one again?

573
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,163
Ed, don't go rushing off.

574
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,699
We can find out about
it tomorrow.

575
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,100
I'm going to bring
the car around

576
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,201
to take her to the hospital,

577
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,071
which is what you should've
done in the first place.

578
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,241
(door slams)

579
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,242
Whoa there, Ed!

580
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,314
Where are you going in
such a hurry?

581
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,050
We've got to get
Mother to a doctor.

582
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:32,717
She's really sick.

583
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,018
No, she's not sick.

584
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,487
She's dead.

585
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,791
You brought her back to life.

586
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,660
No, we brought her back
from the dead.

587
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,761
What's the difference?

588
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,663
Well, the difference is
she doesn't need a doctor.

589
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,131
They don't treat the dead.

590
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,235
What does she need?

591
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,837
More life.

592
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,142
Are you trying to rip me off?

593
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,712
Have I not been fair?

594
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,247
Have I not kept my word
on every deal we made?

595
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:07,285
I busted my hump on this deal
and this is the thanks I get?

596
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,787
Well, all right, fine.

597
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,623
I'm not gonna force you to
be ripped off by me anymore.

598
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,231
(engine revs)

599
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,770
(knocking)

600
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,505
What did you mean
before when you said

601
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,639
she needs more life?

602
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,408
I'd sure enough like
to tell you, Ed,

603
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,344
but (chuckles) I'm a salesman.

604
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,712
That's how I make my living.

605
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,215
How much?

606
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,184
(sighs)

607
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,588
I feel terrible about
charging you, Ed, I really do.

608
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,423
[Ed] How much?

609
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,292
(AJ sighs)

610
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,260
900.

611
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,461
[Ed] 900?!

612
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,264
I'm giving you our Happy
People good customer discount.

613
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,766
[Ed] $900?!

614
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,168
Hey, we're talking
the secret of life here.

615
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,403
This isn't something you pick up

616
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,571
as a blue light special
down at Kmart.

617
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,776
(Ed sighs)

618
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,676
Boy.

619
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,015
Make that out to the

620
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,785
- Happy People Corporation.
- Corporation, yeah, I know.

621
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,121
(television chattering)

622
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:17,822
She's right here.

623
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,331
Give me some room to work, Ed.

624
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,304
This is Mr. Pattle.

625
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,506
He's from the Happy
People Corporation.

626
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,578
(squishing)

627
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,854
(panting)

628
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,289
(sighs)

629
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,190
Yee-haw!

630
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,462
(burps)

631
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,362
Pardon me.

632
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,499
I think I'll go fix supper.

633
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,734
(chuckles)

634
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,505
How did you do that?

635
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,707
This kit contains life.

636
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,510
You get hurt two of these
every night before bedtime,

637
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,511
she'll be fine.

638
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,613
By the way, Ed, you're in luck.

639
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,781
These kits are on sale.

640
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:17,682
349.99.

641
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,921
(chuckles)

642
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,426
This is not right.

643
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,795
Lady's dead.

644
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,896
She shouldn't be here.

645
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,831
You oughta take her back.

646
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,400
She isn't some Christmas
present you can return

647
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,936
just because it's
the wrong size.

648
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,272
Look, everybody panics at first,

649
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,773
but these things
always work out.

650
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,943
Why don't you just give it a
few days and see what happens?

651
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,929
(beeping)

652
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:05,963
What the?

653
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:06,964
Whoa!

654
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,865
Jesus!

655
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,968
Bugs?!

656
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,570
Not bugs.

657
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,471
Life.

658
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,274
I'm supposed to
feed these to--

659
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,843
Uh-huh, every night
before bedtime, two of them.

660
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,411
Never more, never less.

661
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,379
Oh my god.

662
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,348
Mother has to eat bugs.

663
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,883
Oh, but only live ones

664
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,885
so she can add their
life to her own.

665
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,819
Throw out the dead ones.

666
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,321
They won't do her any good.

667
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,990
Unless, of course, she
just wants a snack.

668
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,258
You'll get used to it.

669
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:34,959
Everybody does.

670
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,764
When it's your time, why don't
you have Ed give us a call.

671
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,998
We'll see what we can do.

672
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:45,970
Ed.

673
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,339
Thanks for the business.

674
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,343
Mother?

675
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,244
Coming!

676
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,048
Yes, dear? What is it?

677
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,549
How do you feel?

678
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,318
Oh, fine!

679
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,053
Supper's ready.

680
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,322
You poor fucks must be starved.

681
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,761
That was kind of unusual
language for Mother,

682
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,462

question to ask you.

692
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,823

[Maureen] Thank you, sir.

Thank You, Maureen.

698
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,639
Come on, Sam, I just
sold Chilton a kit.

699
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:55,506
Yeah.

700
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,777
Oh, yeah, for 349.99.

701
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,812
- Big deal.
- I gave him the sale price.

702
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,914
Oh, come on, AJ.

703
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,517
The guy got 60 grand in
insurance money.

704
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,085
He doesn't need to be
buying shit on sale.

705
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,554
He's a good kid, I thought
I'd give him a break.

706
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,990
Look, we've got to
get what we can

707
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,527
out of this reanimation
thing as fast as possible.

708
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,628
The Japanese are working on

709
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,430
their own version,
you know that?

710
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,098
The Dutch already
have a prototype.

711
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,467
And it's rumored that
they're coming out

712
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,836
with home reanimation
software this fall.

713
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,406
It's play or fold time, AJ.

714
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,874
I don't think it would
be so terrible

715
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,577
to let our customers be happy
once in a while, do you?

716
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,079
You want happy customers?

717
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,114
Go into the flower business.

718
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,816
You wanna stay in this business,

719
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,552
you make the final sale
to this hardware man

720
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:45,723
and you have his check on my
desk for $50,000 in two days.

721
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,360
Morning, Uncle Benny.

722
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,881
Didn't this wall
used to be blue?

723
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,883
Your mother painted
it this morning.

724
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,652
She also rearranged
the cupboards,

725
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,456
polished the silverware,
did all the floors,

726
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,058
started herself a dress,
and baked a few pies.

727
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,160
You want some?

728
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,930
(ominous music)

729
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,944
She ate all the bugs.

730
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,579
Great deduction, Sherlock.

731
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:42,813
[Ed] Well, how'd she get them?

732
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,982
(barking)

733
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,891
(elegant opera music)

734
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,477
(sighs)

735
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,912
You know, Ed,

736
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,848
I didn't mind when you
drug out the Ouija board

737
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,851
or got those tarot cards or
had the seance at midnight.

738
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:22,953
Fine with me.

739
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,890
I didn't even mind when you
had the psychic readings

740
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,991
with that smelly, fat guy

741
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,826
that stunk up the
house for a week.

742
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,195
I never said a word.

743
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,032
But this is too much.

744
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,203
It's not right.

745
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,471
It's not meant to be.

746
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,074
I want you to go to that Mr.
Pattle,

747
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,577
ask for your thousand
dollars back--

748
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,013
Actually, it's
more like 3,700.

749
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,184
Well, there were a few
extra expenses.

750
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,219
Whatever.

751
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,189
Just get your money back

752
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,790
and have him put
your mother back

753
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,792
in her grave where she belongs.

754
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,228
I don't think he's gonna
give me my money back.

755
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,863
All right, forget the money.

756
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,566
(sighs)

757
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,233
Your mother's dead.

758
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,269
Let her rest in peace
for God's sakes.

759
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,140
Darn it, Uncle Benny.

760
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,275
She's my mother.

761
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,613
I lost her once, I'm not
gonna lose her again.

762
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,948
I made her a promise.

763
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,250
(loud slurping)

764
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,655
Hey, my favorite show's
about to come on telescope.

765
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,556
Television.

766
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,863
(sighs)

767
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:52,643
[Storm] Hi, Ed.

768
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,880
Hi.

769
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,083
Mind if I sit down?

770
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,318
Oh, no, please.

771
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,754
(chuckles)

772
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,824
I was just whittling a loon.

773
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,930
(sighs)

774
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,866
Can I get you a
lemonade or Popsicle?

775
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,202
No thanks.

776
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,240
(sighs)

777
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,612
You wanna talk about it?

778
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,281
About what?

779
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,251
Whatever's bothering you.

780
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,321
Is it your mother?

781
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,190
No.

782
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,225
Why do you say that?

783
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,662
Well, you said she
wasn't feeling well.

784
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:45,996
I thought maybe it was serious.

785
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,864
It's not serious.

786
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,564
She's fine now.

787
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,166
I mean, she was a little sick.

788
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,835
Okay, I'm sorry I asked.

789
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,407
(Ed sighs)

790
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,708
I'm sorry, I...

791
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,911
I guess I'm a little tired.

792
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,317
Maybe I should go to bed.

793
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,898
[Storm] Ed?

794
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:55,766
Ed?

795
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,867
[Ed] Mm-hm?

796
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:01,905
Can I use your bathroom?

797
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,910
Yeah, sure.

798
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,178
It's, uh...

799
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:12,149
You go through this door and
then up these stairs over here,

800
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,451
and that's your first
door on the left.

801
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,323
Okay.

802
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,200
(sighs)

803
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:56,927
[Mother] Yee-haw!

804
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,198
(gasps)
Oh.

805
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,167
- Oh.
- Uh, I've gotta go.

806
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,168
Mother's calling.

807
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,170
Oh, well, um, all right.

808
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,273
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow?

809
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,441
- Yeah.
- Okay.

810
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,085
(upbeat music)

811
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,322
Woo!

812
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,294
Oh, hi, Eddie.

813
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,029
How's it hanging?

814
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,832
(humming)

815
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,867
I saw you with that
neighbor girl.

816
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,369
Oh, well, she's very nice,
Mother.

817
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,305
[Mother] Oh, she's a tramp!

818
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,006
No, she's not like
that at all.

819
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,975
She'll break your heart.

820
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,444
Stay at home with me.

821
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,547
After all, that's where all
good sons belong anyhow.

822
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,284
(humming)

823
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,219
Mother?

824
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,121
Don't you think you
should settle down?

825
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,388
Heck no.

826
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,959
Oh, I could dance the
whole night away!

827
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,961
Matter of fact, I just might.

828
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,598
Well, I'm going to bed.

829
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,465
[Mother] Ooh!

830
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,333
Ooh!

831
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,200
Ooh!

832
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,570
(mother laughs)

833
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,140
(bell rings)

834
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,047
[Reverend Praxton] Morning,
Ed!

835
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,482
Oh, good morning, Reverend.

836
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,051
Can I do for you?

837
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,921
Have those 490-pound
spring-loaded,

838
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,423
blue gauge steel Ticonda
bear traps come in yet?

839
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,227
Look, Reverend, I know
this is none of my business,

840
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,963
but are you really sure
that's what you want?

841
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,500
You think maybe I should
get a stronger load?

842
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,102
No.

843
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,436
What I meant was
shouldn't you try

844
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,539
marriage counseling or
something first?

845
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,307
Ed, when that
whore gets caught

846
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,543
in a 490-pound spring-loaded,

847
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,045
blue gauge steel
Ticonda bear trap,

848
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,514
that's all the marriage
counseling we'll ever need.

849
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,715
Look, I don't think I can--

850
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:03,120
Ed, I like to grease the
high board better than anyone,

851
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,189
and if it was only four
or five guys,

852
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,124
I'd have no problem with that.

853
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,394
But when I come home and find
her doing the two backed beast

854
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,596
with the entire church council,

855
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,465
well, by God, that's
going too far,

856
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,001
especially since half
the council's women.

857
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,638
That's when I take a stand!

858
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,675
That's when I'm
counted as a man!

859
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,678
That's when I throw my
balls up over my shoulder

860
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,646
and charge into the fire!

861
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,283
Are you following this, son?

862
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,087
Just get me the trap.

863
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:39,623
Right.

864
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,361
(phone rings)

865
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,229
Chilton's Hardware.

866
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,631
Tool for every need,
need for every...

867
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,665
Oh, hi, Uncle Benny.

868
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,102
Oh.

869
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,172
Um, okay, well, I'll
be right home.

870
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,507
Excuse me, Reverend.

871
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:02,479
Uh, Big Lar, can you help
the Reverend, please?

872
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:18,962
Oh, boy.

873
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,267
Then I said, if you
can't come down 10,000,

874
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,534
I'm walking out the door.

875
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,271
Then I walked out the door!

876
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,272
(laughs)

877
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,273
Right out the door!

878
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,375
(laughs)

879
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,146
Speed out the door!
(laughs)

880
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,047
Ed!

881
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,184
I bet you remember
your Uncle Bill

882
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,153
- and your Aunt Sophie.
- Aunt Sophie!

883
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,055
- Hi, it's great to see you.
- From your father's side

884
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,657
- of the family.
- Hello there, hi.

885
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,560
- Where's--
- You must mean your Aunt May,

886
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,430
your mother's
identical twin sister,

887
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,566
who's up visiting from
Missouri for couple of weeks.

888
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,537
Oh, Aunt May, yes, right.

889
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,172
Where is she?

890
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,040
[Benny] She's out
in the kitchen,

891
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:06,009
fixing a little lunch
for all of us.

892
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,577
[Ed] I'll just go see
how she's doing.

893
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,645
[Benny] Great idea.

894
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,448
I just can't get over

895
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,483
how much May looks like
your late sister.

896
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,386
It's almost like having
her back from the grave.

897
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,254
Exactly.

898
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,691
(coughing)
Oh, oh, oh.

899
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:21,591
There.

900
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,593
Pardon my reach.

901
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,261
(chuckles)

902
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,064
Oh, what cute little doggy.

903
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,465
[Sophie] Oh, thank you.

904
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,700
Do we have any ketchup?

905
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,070
For the sandwiches.

906
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,171
Oh, right.

907
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:34,871
I'll get it.

908
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,107
Oh, boy, these look delicious.

909
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,642
I hope you didn't work
up too much of a sweat

910
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:39,609
just like all of us.

911
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,378
Don't be silly.

912
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,180
No sweat at all.

913
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,382
As a matter of fact, I
found I stay much cooler

914
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,451
ever since I quit
wearing underwear.

915
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,652
(chuckles)

916
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,187
Well, let's dig in!

917
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,757
Mm! Mm!

918
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,792
This is good.

919
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,161
Oh, that is delicious!

920
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,597
Mm, that's very different
flavors for me.

921
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,799
Well, thank you.

922
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,334
I left the drinks in
the kitchen.

923
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,402
I'll go get them.

924
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:06,703
No, it's all right, dear.

925
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,804
I'll be right back.

926
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,640
You know, I'm not real hungry.

927
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,242
Give that to little doggy.

928
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:13,443
[Bill] Where's Tucker anyway?

929
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,312
- Tucker, where are you?
- Tucker.

930
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,113
- Where's baby?
- Tuck.

931
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,215
(whirring)
Tucker, wucker, Tucky.

932
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,316
- Tucker!
- Tucky.

933
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,118
- Bill, please find him.
- Tuck-Tuck, where are you?

934
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,219
Tucker, where'd you go?

935
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,588
(loud whirring)

936
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,489
Mother!

937
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,658
What are you doing?

938
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,194
Making paste for the
sandwiches, why?

939
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,164
Their dog was missing
and I thought--

940
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:34,831
(mother laughs)

941
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,666
Oh, no, dear.

942
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,370
Their little doggy's right here.

943
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,238
(chuckles)

944
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,606
- Tucker!
- Oh, now,

945
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,142
look at those cute bright eyes!

946
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:46,710
[Bill] Down there, Tucker?

947
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,378
- Tucker, come on, Tucker.
- Here, Tucky.

948
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,113
Mama, Tucky-Wucky, were are--

949
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,416
- Tucky, Tuck-Tuck.
- Tuck!

950
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,683
- Tucker!
- Tucky-Wucky, Tucker.

951
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,218
[Bill] Little Tuck-Tuck!

952
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,520
Go on, go.

953
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,854
You have to get rid of them,
Uncle Benny.

954
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,489
- Tuck!
- How am I gonna do that?

955
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,324
I don't know, but be subtle,
okay?

956
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,692
You don't wanna offend them.

957
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,594
- I'll take care of it.
- Tucker?!

958
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,297
[Sophie] Oh, look,
we found him!

959
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,232
[Bill] Benny, we found Tuck.

960
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,435
We got our little Tucky back,
yes.

961
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,369
[Sophie] Hello, baby.

962
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,671
Get the hell outta here!

963
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,441
(tires screech)

964
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,346
(gentle guitar music)

965
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,805
(doorbell rings)

966
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,734
[Storm] Ed.

967
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,636
What were you doing
in my house?

968
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:22,372
Um, I was looking for you.

969
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,774
You were looking for me?

970
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,945
I just had to see you again.

971
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,383
You wanna come inside?

972
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,888
Sure, I have a few minutes.

973
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,830
(apprehensive music)

974
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,433
(groaning)

975
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,601
Ouch. Dammit.

976
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,805
It's gonna have to keep
her for tonight.

977
00:52:58,608 --> 00:52:59,376
Here you go, sis!

978
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,680
Just the way you like
them, fresh and squiggly.

979
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,614
Yum-yum, yum-yum.

980
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,519
Come on, take them.

981
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,722
I don't wanna watch
unless I have to.

982
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,598
Ed!

983
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:30,640
Ed!

984
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:38,782
Ed!

985
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,657
(groans)

986
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,427
Uh, I think it's time
for me to be getting home.

987
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,296
No.

988
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,698
No.

989
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,466
I think it's time for
the bedroom.

990
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,036
Mm.

991
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,517
(doorbell ringing)

992
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,554
Who could that be?

993
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,924
I'll take care of it
and I'll be right back.

994
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,401
Ed, there you are.

995
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,902
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

996
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,637
Uncle Benny,
what's the matter?

997
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,439
[Storm] Ed, hurry up.

998
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,740
I'm waiting for you.

999
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,410
Is that her?

1000
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,344
The neighbor?

1001
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,113
Were you and her...

1002
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,382
Oh my god.

1003
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,688
Ed, you gotta let me go across
the street, get my camera.

1004
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,423
This is definitely a
Kodak moment.

1005
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,625
Uncle Benny, what
did you want?

1006
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,860
It's your mother, she's gone.

1007
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:31,928
What do you mean she's gone?

1008
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,129
How did she get out?

1009
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,065
How do I know how she got out?

1010
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,534
Maybe she just burrowed
out the basement.

1011
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,468
Did you check the
refrigerator?

1012
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,602
She's not in the refrigerator.

1013
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,604
She's not anyplace in the house.

1014
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,539
(sighs)

1015
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,541
Think maybe she went
down by the river?

1016
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:45,842
She could've gone
down by the river

1017
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,077
to catch herself a rat.

1018
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,079
Oh, no. Let's go.

1019
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,016
Uncle Benny, come on.

1020
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:56,853
Ed.

1021
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,522
Ed?

1022
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,761
Ed had to go, but if you're
looking for some company,

1023
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,997
I've got a few minutes
and I would be happy--

1024
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,567
(door slams)

1025
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,590
(doorbell chimes)

1026
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,769
(loud clank)

1027
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,221
(loud smash)

1028
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,200
Hello?

1029
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,260
(chuckles)

1030
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,598
(loud smash)

1031
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,050
(gentle piano music)

1032
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,937
(door clattering)

1033
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,241
(door thuds)

1034
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,253
Why, hello, Robert!

1035
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,289
It's nice to see you again.

1036
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,224
(chuckles)

1037
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,926
Oh, well, come and sit down.

1038
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,161
(chuckles)

1039
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,109
You know, everybody in town
kept telling me you were dead.

1040
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,844
Now, why would they tell
you a thing like that?

1041
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,913
- What'd you say?
- What'd you say?

1042
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,683
I said why would they
tell you a thing like that?!

1043
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,689
I don't know, but
it didn't work.

1044
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,093
(chuckles)

1045
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,030
I'm gonna get you,

1046
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,168
because once I start
out for revenge,

1047
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,270
I never stop, never stop.

1048
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:36,906
Does that make sense?

1049
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,909
Yes.

1050
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,078
And good for you, Robert.

1051
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,682
Stick-to-itiveness is a
virtue in any line of work.

1052
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,917
(chuckles)

1053
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,655
(groans)

1054
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,223
Would you care for some tea?

1055
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,859
(Rob groaning)

1056
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:57,927
(chuckles)

1057
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:58,962
Oh, yeah, tea.

1058
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:00,563
That sounds good.

1059
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,031
Tea would really hit the spot.

1060
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,833
(mother chuckles)

1061
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:04,701
Does that make sense?

1062
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,903
Oh, yes, of course.

1063
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:08,938
I'll be right.

1064
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,283
Mother?!

1065
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:28,925
Mother!

1066
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,300
We're never going to find her.

1067
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:42,171
You should go back home
in case she shows up there.

1068
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,010
I'm gonna check the stockyards,

1069
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,849
the animal shelter, and
the petting zoo,

1070
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:53,850
just in case.

1071
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,926
Finger sandwiches.

1072
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,827
Oh, yes.

1073
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,369
This is frigging coffee!

1074
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,470
You said tea!

1075
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,941
You know, you're
absolutely right.

1076
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,445
Oh, how could I make such
a silly mistake?

1077
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:23,980
(sighs)

1078
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:27,083
I'll have some tea for
you in a second, dear.

1079
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,318
(chuckles)

1080
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:32,255
[Rob] Yeah.

1081
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,231
Oh my, this is so
embarrassing,

1082
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,867
but we seem to be
all out of tea.

1083
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,235
I'm afraid you'll just have to

1084
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,805
settle for this!
(loud whirring)

1085
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,940
(screams)

1086
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,013
(birds chirping)

1087
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,892
(gentle music)

1088
01:02:55,138 --> 01:03:00,143
(soft dripping)
(television chattering)

1089
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,048
(loud crack)

1090
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:42,618
Ed?

1091
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,054
We need to powwow.

1092
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,427
You never said anything
like this was gonna happen.

1093
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,368
You told me this was gonna
be a clean deal, Mr. Pattle.

1094
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,372
How clean do you
expect it to be?

1095
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:06,175
We make a living feeding
bugs to dead people,

1096
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:07,977
for crying out loud.

1097
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,613
Look, all I know is
that we've gone

1098
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,982
from the Happy
People Corporation

1099
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,284
to Murder Incorporated in
one fell swoop.

1100
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,153
Do you think I'm a
happy man because of this?

1101
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,021
Do you think I sleep
well at night?

1102
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,124
Jeez, I can't remember
the last time

1103
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,227
I got a good night's sleep.

1104
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,330
And I've got an ulcer the
size of Lake Michigan.

1105
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,599
She killed a man.

1106
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:33,369
No, she killed a jailbird.

1107
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:46,515
What about Ed?

1108
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,684
What's gonna happen to him?

1109
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:50,553
Who's Ed?

1110
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,993
Listen, sweetheart, I
didn't hire you

1111
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:00,296
and put you in this home to
shake your ass a few times

1112
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,131
and then run like a
scared rabbit

1113
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,134
the moment things get a
little confusing around here.

1114
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:09,038
You wanna keep this job,
you play ball, capisce?

1115
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:12,208
Yeah, I wanna keep this
job, but not that bad.

1116
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,355
She can't get out now.

1117
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,624
There's only two keys.

1118
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:32,261
We watch them both carefully,
everything will be fine.

1119
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,162
Here's yours.

1120
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,169
Ed, you gotta do her.

1121
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,205
[Ed] What?

1122
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,106
Snuff her.

1123
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:46,976
Rub her out.

1124
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,614
Pump her full of lead.

1125
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,383
Waste her.

1126
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,989
Reintroduce her to
the big sleep.

1127
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,092
Are you nuts?

1128
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,061
That'd be murder.

1129
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:06,929
Murder?

1130
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:09,999
Why are you always so dramatic?

1131
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,601
How can it be murder?

1132
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,470
She's already dead.

1133
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,606
Look, we've got new
locks on the doors.

1134
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,808
We'll feed her lots of bugs.

1135
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:21,177
That oughta keep her
at home nights.

1136
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,411
[Benny] Don't be stupid.

1137
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,247
I think it's a
perfectly logical solution

1138
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,782
to the problem we have.

1139
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,384
I think Mother would
agree with me.

1140
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,686
Oh, yeah, there's a
ringing endorsement.

1141
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,321
Don't you understand?

1142
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,124
Life is a drug and
she is addicted.

1143
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,059
The more she gets, the
more she wants.

1144
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,260
Yesterday was bugs.

1145
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,362
Today, humans.

1146
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,330
Tomorrow, horses?

1147
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,132
What then? Elephants?

1148
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,367
What are you gonna do?

1149
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,202
Take her on an eating safari?

1150
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,137
I will not hurt Mother!

1151
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:48,804
I made her a promise!

1152
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:53,376
What the hell is this promise
that you keep talking about?

1153
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,412
(sighs)

1154
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,614
I promised her, that
no matter what,

1155
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,082
I'd never say goodbye.

1156
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:05,354
That's it?

1157
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,057
That's the promise?

1158
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:14,597
Jeez, that's the dumbest
thing that I ever heard.

1159
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,731
It is not.

1160
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:19,735
She is playing pathologist
with our good chainsaw,

1161
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,371
and you're worried
about some promise

1162
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,572
that you made to her.

1163
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,377
I gave her my word,
Uncle Benny.

1164
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:32,281
I intend to keep it,
regardless of what you think.

1165
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,849
(Benny sighs)

1166
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:34,750
Piss on it.

1167
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,387
I'll do it myself.

1168
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,514
(gun firing)

1169
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,194
Ed, could you come up
here for a second?

1170
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,708
(sniffing)

1171
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:33,776
You smell smoke?

1172
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,918
Ed, I think we got a bigger
problem than we thought.

1173
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,825
What are you looking for?

1174
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:50,759
Mr. Pattle's phone number.

1175
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,961
I think we better call him.

1176
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:53,562
That's a great idea.

1177
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,464
He's been a marvelous
help so far.

1178
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,870
Mr. Pattle, this is
that Ed Chilton.

1179
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,505
Yeah, I need to talk to you.

1180
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,675
Okay, I can be there
in 10 minutes.

1181
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,377
Right.

1182
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:13,215
Ed, I don't want to add
to your misery or anything,

1183
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,618
but you really oughta see this.

1184
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,358
What's she doing?

1185
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,860
Well, I've had my eye
on her from time to time,

1186
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,696
and it would appear to me
she's leaving.

1187
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:32,635
Why me, Uncle Benny?

1188
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:36,338
Why does all this stuff
have to happen to me?

1189
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:38,674
Why not?

1190
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:41,911
Watch Mother.

1191
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,553
What are you doing?

1192
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:51,453
Leaving.

1193
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,423
Where are you going?

1194
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:57,526
I don't know.

1195
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,996
Well, are you coming back?

1196
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,498
I don't know that either.

1197
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,268
Just going to leave
and then we'll never see

1198
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,970
each other again, is that it?

1199
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,438
I don't get it.

1200
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,606
I thought we had
something special,

1201
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,874
and now you're leaving
without a word,

1202
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,809
without telling me a thing?

1203
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:16,278
Ed, you're in my way.

1204
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,622
(gentle jazz music)

1205
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,362
[Ed] Mr. Pattle.

1206
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,031
Ed, you said you had
some sort of trouble?

1207
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:36,999
(sighs)

1208
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:38,767
I've gotta put Mother
back in the grave.

1209
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:43,606
Well, jeez, Ed, that's kind
of a big change in attitude.

1210
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,040
Are you sure?

1211
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,742
I don't have a choice.

1212
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,310
It's not the same.

1213
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,446
I thought it would be,
but she's different.

1214
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,784
Well, can you help me?

1215
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:56,986
Well, sure I can, Ed,

1216
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:00,623
but the putting her back
in the grave secret,

1217
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:01,557
that's a big one.

1218
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:04,727
Gonna cost a bundle.

1219
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:07,696
Well, I've gotta do it.

1220
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:08,597
How much?

1221
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,867
(sighs)

1222
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:13,469
$50,000.

1223
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,472
Now, I realize that's
an awful lot of money,

1224
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,608
but let's consider what
you're getting.

1225
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,910
A solution to all your problems,

1226
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,013
an end to this misery
your life has become,

1227
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,047
and let's face it, Ed,

1228
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,050
you don't want people
remembering her this way.

1229
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,453
Let them remember the fine,
sweet, loving woman she was,

1230
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,889
not the monster she's become.

1231
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:34,823
Be a good son.

1232
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,558
Honor your mother's memory.

1233
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:37,326
Do the right thing.

1234
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,062
But you're taking the
last of the insurance money

1235
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,230
I got from Mother.

1236
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:45,434
In a way, then, it's kinda
fitting, wouldn't you say?

1237
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,141
Oh, Benny.

1238
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:56,912
(loud clang)
(groaning)

1239
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,016
Sorry, Benny.

1240
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,051
You'll be all right.

1241
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,019
(groans)

1242
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:07,056
(upbeat drum music)

1243
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,461
Good morning.

1244
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,966
(bell rings)

1245
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,502
Morning, Lar!

1246
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,738
How do I look?

1247
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,110
Good.

1248
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,114
Real good for
someone who's dead.

1249
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:33,082
(chuckles)

1250
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,617
I picked this up at
Beyers this morning.

1251
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,420
Is this one of them hauntings?

1252
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,825
Punishing me for all the
terrible deeds

1253
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,761
I've done in the past,
thereby reforming my future?

1254
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,196
(laughs)

1255
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,030
Of course not!

1256
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:52,801
Say, could you help me
with the lawnmowers?

1257
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:53,969
Oh, sure, Mrs. Chilton.

1258
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,038
- They're back there.
- Yeah, I know.

1259
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,709
Are you the ghost of
Independence Day past?

1260
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,912
Are there gonna be three of you?

1261
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,015
Is there a moral lesson

1262
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,917
I'm supposed to be
drawing from this?

1263
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,121
You got anything
bigger than this?

1264
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,023
Mrs. Chilton, this is
plenty of mower

1265
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:15,958
for the little lawn you got.

1266
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,928
How much would it take
to cut a dog in two?

1267
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,232
Well, how big a dog?

1268
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:24,600
Big one.

1269
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,634
Say, a shepherd.

1270
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,172
Five horsepower oughta
do her in one pass.

1271
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,442
Hmm.

1272
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,679
Get me something
three times that.

1273
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:43,786
Jeez, you'd be
talking a rider then.

1274
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,087
A rider?

1275
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,522
(chuckles)

1276
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,023
A rider it shall be.

1277
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,527
(sighs)

1278
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,828
Okay, I think I got it.

1279
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,131
Well, there's one more part.

1280
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,166
What?

1281
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,834
If you don't bury her head

1282
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,836
in the northeast corner
of the cemetery,

1283
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:04,139
between the first and the
12th stroke of midnight,

1284
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:07,176
she'll walk this earth
for a thousand years.

1285
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,112
That doesn't sound good.

1286
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,681
Particularly since she'll
randomly kill anything

1287
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:15,717
that crosses her path, starting
with whoever buried her.

1288
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:19,888
[Ed] Is there anything else?

1289
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,523
Oh, yeah.

1290
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,292
You gotta do it yourself,

1291
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,561
because you're the one
who contracted it.

1292
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:27,996
And once you bury the head,

1293
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,901
bury her body in the
southwest corner

1294
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,671
with her neck pointing
toward her head.

1295
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,775
Neck toward head.

1296
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,077
Is that it?

1297
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,614
(sighs)

1298
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,281
Okay.

1299
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:54,523
Thanks for the drink.

1300
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:58,293
Ed.

1301
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:03,866
Good luck.

1302
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,535
Thanks.

1303
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:13,141
(upbeat drum music)

1304
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,690
(loud pop)

1305
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,195
Come on.

1306
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,730
You ready, huh?

1307
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,832
(laughs)

1308
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:45,908
(loud crash)

1309
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,976
(laughs)

1310
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,781
I'll teach you a lesson about
stealing another woman's son!

1311
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:54,683
(yelps)

1312
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,785
(laughs)

1313
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,657
Eat grass, bitch!

1314
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,660
(laughs)

1315
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:05,394
(screams)

1316
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,362
(loud whirring)

1317
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,997
(tires screeching)

1318
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:10,332
Die!

1319
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,368
(chainsaw whirring)

1320
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:23,245
Mother!

1321
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:26,782
Eddie, am I ever
glad to see you!

1322
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,417
This thing got stuck in gear

1323
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,686
and I didn't know
how to stop it!

1324
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,853
Eddie dear.

1325
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:32,754
(chainsaw revs)
No, Ed!

1326
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,390
I'm your mother.

1327
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:40,095
Let's forget all about this
nonsense and go right on home.

1328
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,964
I'll fix your
favorite breakfast,

1329
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:45,801
pancakes with syrup,
maple syrup,

1330
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,804
eggs, sunny-side up,
bacon with grease,

1331
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,239
everything you like,
just the way you like it.

1332
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,241
(chainsaw revving)
This is her fault!

1333
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,378
She's the one that gave
me the overdose.

1334
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,947
She's the one that got
me addicted to life!

1335
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,716
She's the villain!

1336
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,019
(chainsaw revving)
(screams)

1337
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,188
(screams)

1338
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,792
(crickets chirping)

1339
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:13,955
(loud clank)
Ouch.

1340
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:18,093
Where am I?

1341
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,229
[Ed] We're in the cemetery,
Mother.

1342
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,964
Who died?

1343
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:24,399
You did.

1344
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,535
I'm putting you back in
the grave where you belong.

1345
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:31,173
Oh, Eddie, don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

1346
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:34,342
Mother, just be quiet,
will you?

1347
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,878
Heck no, I've got all
eternity to be quiet.

1348
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:38,313
I wanna talk!

1349
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,881
I wanna sing!

1350
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:40,982
(coughs softly)

1351
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:45,287
♪ My Bonnie lies
over the ocean ♪

1352
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,524
♪ My Bonnie lies over the sea

1353
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:53,995
♪ My Bonnie lies
over the ocean ♪

1354
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,530
♪ Oh, bring back
Come on.

1355
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,565
What's the matter, Ed?

1356
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,066
You wanna get rid of me?

1357
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,169
Look, this is harder
on me than it is on you.

1358
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,370
Oh, yeah?

1359
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,439
Then why don't you give
me the shovel

1360
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:07,309
and you get right in here and
spend the rest of eternity

1361
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,344
with worms burrowing
through your skull?

1362
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:17,419
I love you.

1363
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,856
Ed, wait.

1364
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,291
At least give me one last kiss.

1365
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,227
Please.

1366
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:29,965
It's the last thing I'll
ever ask of you.

1367
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,537
(gentle orchestral music)

1368
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:43,145
Eddie, you promised
you'd never say goodbye.

1369
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:46,982
Mother, you don't understand.

1370
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:51,920
I'm not saying goodbye,
not in my heart.

1371
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,158
I'll think of you a
hundred times a day.

1372
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:01,163
I'll be sad every night your
place is empty at the table.

1373
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,932
I'll smile every time I
think of something

1374
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,167
that would've amused you.

1375
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,602
But we each have to move on.

1376
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:12,040
We have to take the path
that's meant for us.

1377
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,511
But you will still be my mother

1378
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:20,015
and I will still be your son.

1379
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,151
And I will still love you,
always.

1380
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,958
Eddie, I love you so.

1381
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:36,097
(bell tolling)

1382
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:37,866
Mother.

1383
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:53,148
(grunts)
(groaning)

1384
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,092
(loud thud)
(grunts)

1385
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,294
(mother laughs)

1386
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:08,163
Too late, Eddie!

1387
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:09,998
You screwed up again!

1388
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,468
I'm gonna live!

1389
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,404
(mother laughs)

1390
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:18,573
(panting)

1391
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,468
Goodbye, Mother.

1392
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,539
(slow jazz music)

1393
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:25,340
(sirens wailing)

1394
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:48,396
What's going on?

1395
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:52,567
Well, it seems the
Reverend went crazy,

1396
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,236
chased his wife into the church,

1397
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,505
and tried to catch her
head in a bear trap.

1398
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,076
(laughs)

1399
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,246
That harlot's turned
this holy place

1400
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,748
into the devil's playground!

1401
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,685
I don't know what set him off!

1402
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,554
He tried to kill me!

1403
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,556
He thought that I was
cheating on him!

1404
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,257
I wasn't, I wasn't!

1405
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,327
Yeah, I'm sure of that, ma'am.

1406
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,162
Oh, where would he
get such an idea?

1407
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:22,364
Where?!

1408
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:23,765
I don't know, ma'am.

1409
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,800
Sometimes, they just flip out.

1410
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:26,468
Wasn't your fault.

1411
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,437
Why don't you go inside
and calm yourself?

1412
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,339
Just put this
incident behind you.

1413
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:35,243
Thank you, officer.

1414
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:42,684
[Officer] So what are
you doing here anyway?

1415
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:44,452
Me?

1416
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,455
I was just praying at my
mother's grave.

1417
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:48,556
[Officer] At midnight?

1418
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:50,558
I pray for her a lot.

1419
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,561
Well, I think you
best get on outta here.

1420
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,564
This is nothing for a
God-fearing man to see.

1421
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:58,833
Thank you.

1422
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:07,108
(loud thud)
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1423
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:11,613
[Officer] Son, you
are one sick individual.

1424
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,626
[Judge] Have you
reached a verdict?

1425
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:27,162
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

1426
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,535
[Judge] How find you?

1427
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:37,772
We find the
defendant not guilty.

1428
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:38,640
(people gasping)
What?!

1429
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:39,607
[Woman] What?!

1430
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,142
Not guilty.

1431
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,143
Not guilty.

1432
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,912
(laughs)

1433
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:44,879
Not guilty.

1434
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:47,649
[Benny] I don't know.

1435
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,617
Guess your luck is
changing, Mr. Chilton.

1436
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,586
You know the part about
being a virgin,

1437
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,388
you got me on that, yes, sir.

1438
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,493
(gentle piano music)

1439
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,203
Ed, I'm glad you got off.

1440
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,676
Look, no matter what they
say, it wasn't just business.

1441
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:17,412
I really did fall in
love with you.

1442
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:22,383
You're the kindest, sweetest,
most...

1443
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:25,220
(sighs)

1444
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:26,788
Now, I told myself I
wouldn't cry.

1445
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,224
You're the most wonderful thing

1446
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:32,494
that's ever happened to me,
and I blew it.

1447
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:37,832
I, um, I'll never forget you.

1448
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:43,605
I just wanted you to know that.

1449
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,882
Oh, by the way, I need a job.

1450
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:04,559
Ed?

1451
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:07,362
What are you doing?

1452
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:08,563
She was in on this.

1453
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:11,533
People are watching.

1454
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,336
She ruined your mother.

1455
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:20,975
Forget Mother.

1456
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:22,977
She's dead.

1457
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,258
(bell rings)

1458
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:37,992
Oh, sorry, we're...

1459
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,762
Ed, before you say anything,

1460
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:44,666
I want you to know I am truly
sorry how things turned out.

1461
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:46,935
It's okay.

1462
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,270
It's all in the past.

1463
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,505
You don't understand.

1464
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:52,607
Happy customers is what
we're all about,

1465
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,610
so I came up with a perfect
way to make things up to you.

1466
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:56,511
