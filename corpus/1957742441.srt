1
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:05,771
HMM.

2
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:07,739
HMM.

3
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,568
HMM.

4
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,363
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "HMM"?

5
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,021
THIS LINE IS VERY LONG.

6
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,748
OH.
IS THAT BAD?

7
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:18,474
THAT'S GOOD.

8
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:20,890
MEANS YOU'LL LIVE
MANY, MANY YEARS.

9
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:22,857
OH, WELL, AS LONG
AS IT DOESN'T INVOLVE

10
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:24,859
ANY UNDUE WEIGHT GAIN.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,796
THIS LINE IS VERY SHORT.

12
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:31,934
IS THAT GOOD?

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,799
NO.
THAT IS BAD.

14
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:35,767
THIS MEANS YOU'VE HAD

15
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:38,459
A VERY DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP
IN YOUR PAST.

16
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,496
PERHAPS SOMEONE HAS WRONGED YOU
SOMEHOW?

17
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:43,464
THEY DID GET MY COFFEE ORDER
WRONG THIS MORNING.

18
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:45,397
YOU MOCK MADAME RENATA?

19
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:48,331
I SEE PAIN IN THIS HAND.

20
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:51,334
THIS LINE... VERY CROOKED.

21
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:52,956
WELL, IS THAT GOOD
OR IS THAT BAD?

22
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,269
THIS MEANS YOU ARE AFRAID
TO TAKE CHANCES IN LIFE.

23
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:57,340
WELL, WHO ISN'T?

24
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:01,344
THOSE WHO WOULD FIND LOVE.

25
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,454
ALL RIGHT.

26
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,077
WE WILL HAVE MORE
OF THESE FASCINATING PREDICTIONS

27
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:12,355
FROM MADAME RENATA

28
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:13,573
RIGHT AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

29
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,468
AND WE'RE OUT.

30
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:27,543
RICK!

31
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,480
LOSE THE FORTUNE-TELLER.

32
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:40,383
- MISS LOVETT, THAT WAS AMAZING.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:41,912
THAT WAS THE WORST SHOW
WE'VE EVER DONE.

34
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,421
THAT WOMAN
WAS A COMPLETE FRAUD.

35
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,915
BUT WHAT SHE SAID
ABOUT YOUR PAST...

36
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,872
SHE WAS FISHING.
SHE'S A FAKE.

37
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,010
I LIKED HER.

38
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:50,393
EVE, EVE, HOLD ON.

39
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,877
WE CAN'T JUST LOSE
THE PSYCHIC.

40
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,534
WE HAVE ANOTHER SEGMENT LEFT
WITH HER.

41
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:55,236
YEAH, WELL, SHORTEN IT UP.
IT'S BORING.

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,399
CAN YOU GIVE US A MOMENT?

43
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:57,918
ARE YOU TWO GONNA FIGHT AGAIN?

44
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:00,403
TRINA, THE PRODUCER
OF THE SHOW AND THE HOST

45
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,956
DO NOT FIGHT;
THEY DISCUSS.

46
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:03,337
RIGHT.

47
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,237
OKAY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

48
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,583
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

49
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:09,121
HAVE YOU SEEN OUR RATINGS
THIS WEEK?

50
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,480
- NO, BUT I...
- LET ME SPARE YOU

51
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:11,380
HAVING TO READ THEM, OKAY?

52
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:12,829
WE WERE BEATEN AGAIN

53
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,418
BY THAT COURTROOM SHOW
ON CHANNEL EIGHT.

54
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,937
THE ONE
WITH THE SINGING JUDGE?

55
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:19,035
IT DOESN'T MEAN
SHE'S NOT WINNING OUR TIME SLOT.

56
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:20,492
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

57
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,125
MADAME SPOOKY EYES
AND HER PALM READING.

58
00:02:22,149 --> 00:02:23,426
PEOPLE LIKE IT.

59
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:25,083
NOT ENOUGH.
RICK, ONE MORE DROP

60
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,543
IN THE RATINGS,
AND WE'LL BE SELLING

61
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,017
EXERCISE BALLS
AT 2:00 A.M.

62
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:29,432
OKAY.

63
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,263
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.
TRINA!

64
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,924
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE SHOW TODAY?

65
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:40,443
I DON'T WATCH TELEVISION.

66
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:42,445
I HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE
TRYING TO CARE

67
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,447
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
IN MY OWN LIFE.

68
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,449
GOOD NIGHT, CAROLYN.

69
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,385
AND MY NAME IS JANICE.

70
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:01,395
THANK YOU.

71
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,444
YES, THANK YOU.

72
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:19,310
GOOD EVENING.

73
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:20,794
GOOD EVENING, MISS LOVETT.

74
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,485
TABLE FOR ONE
AS USUAL?

75
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,315
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB IT IN,
LOUIS.

76
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:25,316
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

77
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,076
MAY I?

78
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,422
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

79
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,447
HELLO.

80
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:29,311
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

81
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,691
MM-HMM.

82
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,383
THIS IS VERY FORWARD OF ME,

83
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,385
BUT I COULDN'T HELP
NOTICING YOU HERE,

84
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,387
AND MY NAME IS DAVID.

85
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,043
HELLO, DAVID.

86
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,700
MY NAME IS EVE.

87
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:42,151
I KNEW IT.
IT'S HER.

88
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,567
SEE, WE HAVE A BET.
MY FRIEND SAID IT WASN'T YOU,

89
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,707
BUT I SAID IT WAS.

90
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,399
USED TO WATCH YOUR SHOW
ALL THE TIME.

91
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,090
- USED TO?
- WELL, NOW WE WATCH

92
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,028
THAT SINGING JUDGE SHOW
OVER ON CHANNEL EIGHT.

93
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,371
ANYWAY, HE'S GOTTA BUY ME
A DRINK NOW,

94
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,855
SO THANKS.

95
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,341
YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU ENJOY THAT.

96
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,836
YOU HAVE NO NEW MESSAGES.

97
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:17,048
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE ALONE.

98
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:19,430
OH.
OH, TAXI.

99
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:22,329
NO, IT'S OKAY.
REALLY, NANCY.

100
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,744
I HAVE COME TO TERMS

101
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,436
WITH THE IDEA
OF BEING SINGLE

102
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,989
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

103
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,691
WHAT, BECAUSE
SOME FORTUNE-TELLER SAID SO?

104
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:31,062
TAXI!
NO.

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,305
IT'S NOT THAT.

106
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,618
I HAVE A VERY FULL LIFE.
I HAVE A CAREER.

107
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:38,414
BESIDES, THERE ARE
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THAN LOVE.

108
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:39,552
LIKE WHAT?

109
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,107
LIKE MY SHOW.

110
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:44,524
THE RATINGS ARE IN THE TOILET.

111
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,422
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WERE MY PATIENT,

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,391
I'D SAY THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
GOING ON HERE BESIDES RATINGS.

113
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,875
TAXI!

114
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:53,533
HONEY, MY RATINGS
ARE EVERYTHING.

115
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,638
BUT THANKS
FOR THE FREE THERAPY.

116
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,640
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
A HOLIDAY.

117
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,377
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO NEW YORK
FOR A WEEKEND?

118
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,817
WE CAN DO THE TOWN.
OH, I WISH I COULD, BUT...

119
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,301
BUT WHAT?
COME ON.

120
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,647
IT'LL BE FUN.

121
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:05,969
MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN MEET
A NICE GUY

122
00:06:05,993 --> 00:06:08,444
AND FALL IN LOVE.
OOH, TAXI!

123
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:09,963
TRUST ME, NANCY.

124
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,379
THE LAST THING I NEED
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW

125
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,587
IS LOVE.

126
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,474
YES?

127
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:39,820
DR. SIDNEY TWADDLE?

128
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,684
IT'S PRONOUNCED TWADDELL.

129
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,686
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, SIR.

130
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,482
YOU JUST WON AN ALL-EXPENSE-PAID
TWO-WEEK VACATION CRUISE

131
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,451
TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

132
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,029
YEAH, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

133
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,637
I AM SCHEDULED TO APPEAR
ON A TELEVISION PROGRAM

134
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,490
LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

135
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:57,355
OH, COME ON,
FREE CRUISE.

136
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,357
DANCING GIRLS?

137
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:00,610
ALL THE COCONUTS
YOU CAN EAT.

138
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,394
I'M ALLERGIC TO COCONUTS.

139
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,614
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

140
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:05,846
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.

141
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,365
THANK YOU.

142
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:10,368
- HEY, TWADDLE.
- YES.

143
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:13,647
HAVE FUN IN TAHITI.

144
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,207
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU,
YOU KNOW.

145
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:23,633
- OH, SHUSH.
- I'M HERE, I'M HERE,

146
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:25,521
I'M HERE.

147
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,213
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT READING
THIS BOOK BY TODAY'S GUEST.

148
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:29,846
- GOOD MORNING, MISS LOVETT.
- GOOD MORNING, BOB.

149
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,389
- IT'S BEN.
- UH, MISS LOVETT,

150
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,219
ABOUT TODAY'S GUEST...
YES, DR. SIDNEY TWADDELL.

151
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,739
AND HE WROTE THIS BOOK
DISSECTION OF LOVE.

152
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:38,914
- AND HE'S NOT HERE.
- WHAT? WHY?

153
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,572
HE HAD TO CANCEL, BUT
MR. DAYTON FOUND A REPLACEMENT.

154
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,470
A REPLACEMENT?
WHO?

155
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,578
AH.

156
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:49,476
VERNON GART.

157
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,754
CUPID INCORPORATED.

158
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:54,757
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
MISS LOVETT.

159
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,759
CUPID INCORPORATED.

160
00:07:56,897 --> 00:07:58,761
NOW WHAT EXACTLY
IS THAT?

161
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,245
CUPID INCORPORATED?

162
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:03,386
WELL, WE OFFER
A VERY SPECIALIZED SERVICE,

163
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,424
ONE THAT THE HEAD OFFICE FEELS
YOU ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF.

164
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:07,425
THE HEAD OFFICE?

165
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,496
YES.

166
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:10,634
ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS,

167
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,568
YOU ARE A COMPLETE FAILURE

168
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,432
IN THE ROMANCE DEPARTMENT.

169
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,617
THIS HAS CAUSED YOU TO CLOSE
YOURSELF DOWN EMOTIONALLY

170
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,642
TO THE WORLD AROUND YOU.

171
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,610
AND IS IN LARGE PART RESPONSIBLE

172
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:22,682
FOR THE UNHAPPINESS THAT YOU
FEEL, WHICH YOU TRY TO SMOTHER

173
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,547
WITH THE EMPTY TRAPPINGS
OF TELEVISION CELEBRITY.

174
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:27,628
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT AT ALL, MR. GART.

175
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:29,620
- MISS LOVETT.
- WHAT?

176
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,038
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU
FIND LOVE.

177
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:39,043
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

178
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:44,358
YEAH, I DEFINITELY...
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

179
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:45,922
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

180
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:47,603
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

181
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,640
I MEAN THERE'S SOME WEIRDO
IN MY OFFICE

182
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,884
TELLING ME THAT I AM A FAILURE
AT LOVE, BUT HE'S HERE TO HELP.

183
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:55,231
YES, I... I WAS GONNA
TELL YOU ABOUT HIM.

184
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,588
WHEN? WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL ME, RICK?

185
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:57,820
WHEN I WAS ON THE AIR?

186
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,650
I GOT A CALL
FROM DR. TWADDELL.

187
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:02,342
SOMETHING ABOUT BEING
ON A BOAT IN TAHITI.

188
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,344
IT WAS A BAD CONNECTION.
I COULDN'T GET IT ALL.

189
00:09:04,482 --> 00:09:07,347
ANYWAY, WE WERE STUCK,
AND THIS GUY'S NAME

190
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:08,925
SUDDENLY CAME UP,
AND HE'S AVAILABLE.

191
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,488
AND HE COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

192
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,629
OKAY, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, RICK.

193
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,458
THIS IS WHY
OUR NUMBERS ARE DOWN.

194
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,497
IT IS THE SAME OLD SELF-HELP
AUTHORS AND PSYCHICS

195
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,189
AND FORTUNE-TELLERS.

196
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:23,432
WE NEED SOMETHING FRESH,

197
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,675
SOMETHING ORIGINAL.

198
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,435
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- WHAT?

199
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:27,885
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE LUCKY

200
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,703
THAT VERNON GART
WAS DROPPED INTO OUR LAPS.

201
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,509
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

202
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,512
I'M TALKING ABOUT...

203
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,170
VALENTINE'S DAY.

204
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:40,863
"EVE'S WEEK OF LOVE."

205
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,624
HUH?
FOUR DAYS

206
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,487
OF ROMANCE-THEMED PROGRAMS,

207
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,525
STARTING WITH VERNON GART,
OUR VERY OWN REPRESENTATIVE

208
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,940
FROM CUPID INCORPORATED,

209
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:50,770
AND FINISHING
WITH A LIVE BROADCAST

210
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,495
IN THE STUDIO.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

211
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,634
NO.

212
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:54,739
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING

213
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:55,740
THAT COULD BRING OUR NUMBERS

214
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,017
BACK UP TO THE TOP.

215
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:59,364
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

216
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:00,572
WHY NOT?

217
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:02,713
BECAUSE, RICK,
IT IS CORNY

218
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,576
AND CHEESY
AND OLD-FASHIONED.

219
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:08,304
LOVE IS CORNY AND CHEESY
AND OLD-FASHIONED, EVE.

220
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,513
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
LOVE BEING IN LOVE.

221
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,146
HAS IT BEEN SO LONG
THAT YOU FORGOT WHAT IT'S LIKE?

222
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,965
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

223
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,450
EVE,
YOU DON'T LET ANYBODY IN.

224
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,970
MAYBE THAT'S WHY OUR AUDIENCE
IS TUNING US OUT.

225
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,421
WELL, I'M SORRY
THAT YOU DON'T THINK

226
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,906
I'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE THE HOST ANYMORE.

227
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:25,874
OH, PERHAPS I'LL TAKE UP
SINGING.

228
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,358
AND THEN I CAN GIVE THE JUDGE

229
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,498
ON CHANNEL EIGHT
A REAL RUN FOR HER MONEY.

230
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,465
EVE...

231
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:36,607
AND HERE WE GO.

232
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:37,920
ANOTHER EXCITING ADVENTURE

233
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:39,750
IN TELEVISION HISTORY.

234
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,407
YOUR ENTHUSIASM IS INSPIRING,
MARV.

235
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:43,945
WELL, I DON'T NEED THIS,
YOU KNOW.

236
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,041
I WAS NOMINATED
FOR AN OSCAR.

237
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,515
IT WAS A STUDENT OSCAR,

238
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:47,930
AND YOU LOST.

239
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:51,796
IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

240
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,559
HERE'S YOUR HOST,

241
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,698
EVE LOVETT.

242
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:01,323
OH, THANK YOU.

243
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,774
HI, EVERYONE,
AND WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

244
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,397
I AM EVE LOVETT,
YOUR HOST,

245
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,779
AND TODAY
OUR VERY SPECIAL GUEST

246
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,953
IS A REMARKABLE MAN

247
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,231
WHO IS GOING TO TELL US ALL
A LITTLE BIT

248
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:14,957
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE IN LOVE.

249
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:19,513
PLEASE WELCOME
MR. VERNON GART.

250
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,558
WELCOME, MR. GART.

251
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,697
OH, PLEASE.

252
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,872
JUST CALL ME VERNON.

253
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,459
OKAY, VERNON,
THANK YOU.

254
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:36,807
NOW, TO START THINGS OFF,
WHY DON'T YOU TELL

255
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,982
OUR AUDIENCE A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO.

256
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,397
WELL, FRANKLY,
MISS LOVETT,

257
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,572
I'D RATHER JUST TALK
ABOUT YOU.

258
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,782
- SORRY, ME?
- MM-HMM.

259
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,335
THIS SHOULD
BE INTERESTING.

260
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:51,476
I'M REALLY JUST HERE
TO HELP YOU FIND LOVE.

261
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,414
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
BUT I DON'T THINK

262
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,997
I NEED HELP
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

263
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:57,482
OH, I BELIEVE YOU DO.

264
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,002
YOU'VE NEEDED MY HELP
SINCE ANDREW VOIVONICH.

265
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,660
WH... HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

266
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:04,838
THE YOUNG BOY WHO DUMPED
YOU IN THE SEVENTH GRADE?

267
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:05,905
I HAVE MY SOURCES.

268
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:10,910
AND, OF COURSE,
THERE WAS CHAZ LELAND,

269
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:12,646
THE HIGH-SCHOOL FOOTBALL
PLAYER WHO TWO-TIMED YOU

270
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,845
WITH MARY-LOUISE BAUMGARTEN
AT THE SENIOR PROM.

271
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,640
OKAY, COME ON,
WHO TOLD HIM?

272
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,504
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?

273
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:22,507
THE WORST WAS THAT JERKY
GUITAR PLAYER IN COLLEGE,

274
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,614
DARIN PALMATERRI.
WHAT?

275
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,202
WHAT?

276
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,618
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE
ABOUT THAT.

277
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:30,999
WHO IS THIS GUY?

278
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:33,518
HAVEN'T YOU HAD
JUST THE WORST LUCK?

279
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:38,558
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORRIED
ABOUT AT THE HEAD OFFICE.

280
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,708
YOU'VE BEEN HURT SO MANY TIMES
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN UP ON LOVE.

281
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,976
SO I'M HERE
TO HELP YOU FIND IT AGAIN.

282
00:12:43,114 --> 00:12:44,495
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH,
RICK.

283
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,048
ALL RIGHT, CUT, CUT.

284
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:51,053
EXCUSE ME.
RICK, RICK.

285
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,573
WHAT IS GOING ON
OUT HERE?

286
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,471
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

287
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,826
DID YOU SET
THIS WHOLE THING UP?

288
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:58,002
I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

289
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,648
WHAT DID YOU DO?

290
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,660
DID YOU GO BACK TO MY HIGH
SCHOOL YEARBOOK OR SOMETHING?

291
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:03,164
I SWEAR,
I DIDN'T TELL HIM ANYTHING.

292
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:04,249
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANY OF THAT STUFF.

293
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:05,378
OKAY, THEN WHO IS HE?

294
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,000
ONE OF YOUR
MIND READERS?

295
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,391
I DON'T KNOW,
WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM?

296
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:11,004
OKAY, I WILL.

297
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:15,837
WHERE'D HE GO?

298
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:19,254
DID ANYONE
SEE HIM LEAVE?

299
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:22,602
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY,
I'LL DEAL WITH IT LATER.

300
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,959
NO SIGN OF HIM
ANYWHERE IN THE BUILDING.

301
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,330
HE MUST HAVE JUST LEFT.

302
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:29,402
I MEAN, YOU WERE NOT VERY
POLITE TO HIM, YOU KNOW.

303
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,990
OH, SO NOW
IT'S MY FAULT.

304
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:32,439
WELL, HE GOT UP
AND WALKED AWAY

305
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,269
FROM THE INTERVIEW WITHOUT
ANY EXPLANATION.

306
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:36,271
POOR GUY MUST HAVE
FELT COMPLETELY INSULTED.

307
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:37,800
YOU COULD STOP THIS,
ANY TIME, YOU KNOW.

308
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,239
STOP WHAT?

309
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,828
I HAVE TO ADMIT THOUGH,
IT'S AN ORIGINAL IDEA.

310
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,244
TALK SHOW GUEST
AS PERFORMANCE ART.

311
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:47,351
EVE, I TOLD YOU,
I HAD NEVER MET THIS GUY BEFORE.

312
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,053
HIS PUBLICIST CALLED,
SUGGESTING HIM FOR THE SHOW,

313
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:51,010
AND WE WERE IN A SPOT,
SO I...

314
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:52,666
NUH-UH,
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

315
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,290
BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

316
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:59,673
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
TO CLEAR IT WITH THE HOST FIRST.

317
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,321
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

318
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,047
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

319
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:30,290
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED
TO DISCUSS

320
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:31,958
SUCH A PRIVATE MATTER
IN A PUBLIC FORUM.

321
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,329
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE
YOU GOT YOUR INFORMATION,

322
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,987
BUT I DO NOT APPRECIATE
MY LOVE LIFE BEING SPREAD

323
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,334
ALL ACROSS AMERICA
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

324
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:41,405
LISTEN,
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

325
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:43,521
BUT YOU'RE A VERY DIFFICULT
PERSON TO GET A HOLD OF,

326
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,764
AND THE HEAD OFFICE FELT THAT
TIME WAS RUNNING OUT FOR YOU.

327
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:48,446
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE HEAD OFFICE FELT.

328
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,310
YOU NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

329
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:52,519
RITA!

330
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:53,865
PLEASE CALL SECURITY.

331
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:55,284
MISS LOVETT,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

332
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,592
NO, RITA,
I AM NOT ALL RIGHT.

333
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,010
WHY DID YOU
LET HIM IN MY OFFICE?

334
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,148
HIM?

335
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:04,324
HE...
I...

336
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:07,258
MISS LOVETT,
CAN I GET YOU SOME TEA?

337
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,952
NO, THANK YOU,
RITA.

338
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:19,029
YES,
HE WAS IN MY OFFICE.

339
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,727
NO, I DON'T KNOW
HOW HE GOT THERE, RICK.

340
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,722
BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT,
IN THE FUTURE,

341
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,803
IF YOU WOULD SCREEN MY GUESTS
A LITTLE MORE THOROUGHLY

342
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:28,003
BEFORE YOU LET ANY CRACKPOT
WITH A BOOK DEAL ON MY SHOW.

343
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,765
OKAY.

344
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,367
NICE WHEELS.

345
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,783
WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

346
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,830
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
BE A MORE PRIVATE PLACE TO TALK.

347
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,442
WHO ARE YOU?

348
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,514
I TOLD YOU, MY NAME
IS VERNON GART AND I WORK FOR...

349
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,068
YEAH, YEAH,
CUPID INCORPORATED.

350
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,897
I GOT THAT PART.

351
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,450
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

352
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,383
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT
FROM YOU, MISS LOVETT.

353
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,041
IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE
FROM YOURSELF.

354
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:06,731
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

355
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,457
WELL, ACCORDING TO YOUR
LOVE PROFILE.

356
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:09,769
MY WHAT?

357
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,874
YOUR LOVE PROFILE,
AT THE HEAD OFFICE.

358
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,738
EVERYONE HAS ONE.

359
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:17,052
AND YOURS SAYS THAT
YOU HAVE COMMITMENT ISSUES.

360
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,710
SO NOT TRUE.

361
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,298
UH, REALLY?

362
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:23,172
WHAT WAS THE LONGEST
RELATIONSHIP YOU EVER HAD?

363
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:24,370
A YEAR.

364
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:26,855
UH-UH.

365
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,409
SAM CALLAHAN, AN INSURANCE
SALESMAN FROM OMAHA, NEBRASKA,

366
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,860
IT LASTED SIX MONTHS,
A WEEK, AND AN AFTERNOON.

367
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:33,724
THAT'S A NICE RUN,

368
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,322
BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,

369
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:36,761
NOW IS IT?

370
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,779
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

371
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,456
BECAUSE UNTIL YOU CAN SEE
THAT LOVE CAN ACTUALLY WORK,

372
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,285
YOU WON'T FIND IT
FOR YOURSELF.

373
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:46,254
THAT IS WHY THE HEAD OFFICE
HAS AUTHORIZED ME

374
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:47,772
TO OFFER YOU A DEAL.

375
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,912
A DEAL?

376
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,260
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HELP
ONE COUPLE FALL IN LOVE.

377
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:53,502
AND THEN WHAT?

378
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,790
AND THEN YOUR ONE,
TRUE LOVE

379
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,368
WILL BE REVEALED TO YOU.

380
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:59,922
MY ONE, TRUE LOVE,
COME ON.

381
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,303
THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.

382
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:03,064
LOVE IS NOT FOR SISSIES.

383
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:05,859
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE BUMPS
AND BRUISES ALONG THE WAY.

384
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:09,449
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT IT?

385
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:12,245
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO FIND LOVE, EVE.

386
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:13,764
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

387
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,318
THIS OFFER EXPIRES
FEBRUARY 14TH.

388
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,778
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE
A LOVE MATCH BY THEN,

389
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:21,323
THEN YOU'RE
OUT OF LUCK FOREVER.

390
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:22,611
WHAT...
THAT'S LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY.

391
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:24,430
THAT'S...
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

392
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:30,332
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE TWO
PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE THAT FAST?

393
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,266
MISS LOVETT,
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

394
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,889
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?

395
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:39,169
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT TEA?

396
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:33,223
OKAY, MR. GART.

397
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,778
LOVE IS IN THE AIR.

398
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,505
LET'S SEE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

399
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,411
I'LL HELP YOU OUT.

400
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:53,553
OKAY, STEADY.
OKAY.

401
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,037
GOOD MORNING,
CAROLYN.

402
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,418
SURE.

403
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:59,318
WHAT'S GOING ON?

404
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,423
OKAY, OKAY,
HERE WE GO.

405
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:06,014
OH, WAIT.
SORRY.

406
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,397
OH, YOU TWO.
SORRY?

407
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:10,935
NO, DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO ME.

408
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:13,366
I JUST LOVE WATCHING
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.

409
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:14,919
IT'S SO CUTE.

410
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:17,439
UH, THANKS.

411
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:22,893
"THANKS."
SO ADORABLE.

412
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,276
THIS IS GOING TO BE
EASIER THAN I THOUGHT.

413
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:27,839
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT DOUG AND TRINA?

414
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:29,624
AND A HAPPY GOOD MORNING
TO YOU TOO.

415
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:31,522
YOU KNOW, THE SOUND MAN
AND MY MAKEUP GIRL.

416
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,869
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE,
I'M JUST SURPRISED THAT YOU DO.

417
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,457
TELL ME A LITTLE
ABOUT THEM.

418
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:37,597
THEY'RE GOOD KIDS,
HARD WORKERS.

419
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,565
HE WANTS TO BE A DIRECTOR,
AND I THINK

420
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:41,394
AND I THINK SHE WANTS
TO OPEN A DAY SPA.

421
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:42,578
THOUGH SHE MOSTLY
SEEMS INTERESTED

422
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:43,948
IN FINDING A BOYFRIEND.

423
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:45,295
OH, REALLY.

424
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,470
YEAH,
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST?

425
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,310
OH, NOTHING,
JUST A NEW RESOLUTION OF MINE.

426
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,518
TRY TO GET TO KNOW
THE CREW A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

427
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,716
REALLY?

428
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,476
WHY DOES THAT
SURPRISE YOU?

429
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:56,306
BECAUSE UNTIL NOW
I DIDN'T THINK

430
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:01,414
YOU REALIZED
THAT WE HAD A CREW.

431
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,637
TRINA,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

432
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,732
SURE, MISS LOVETT.

433
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,665
OH, PLEASE,
DISPENSE WITH THE FORMALITIES.

434
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,392
CALL ME EVE.
OKAY, EVE.

435
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,428
TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR LOVE LIFE.

436
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,327
MY WHAT?

437
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,916
YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF GUYS
DO YOU LIKE?

438
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,953
I DON'T KNOW,
IT KIND OF VARIES.

439
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:26,336
YEAH, WELL, WHAT ABOUT
SOMEONE LIKE DOUG?

440
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:27,509
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF HIM?

441
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:29,580
UH, DOUG'S AWESOME.

442
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:31,686
AWESOME, OH,
WELL THAT'S GOOD.

443
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:35,759
SO YOU'D SAY THAT YOU WERE
ATTRACTED TO HIM?

444
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:39,107
UM, I DON'T KNOW,
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

445
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:42,352
EVE LOVETT SHOW,
15 MINUTE STUDIO CALL.

446
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,630
15 MINUTES.
THINK ABOUT IT.

447
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,537
HEY, WHERE YOU BEEN?
WE'RE READY TO ROLL.

448
00:20:55,675 --> 00:21:01,371
I KNOW, I, UM...
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY MIC.

449
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,545
DOUG.
HEY, HONEY.

450
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:05,444
I'M HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH MY MIC,

451
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:07,377
COULD YOU TAKE A PEAK
AT THAT FOR ME PLEASE?

452
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:08,378
SURE, MISS LOVETT,
NO PROBLEM.

453
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,103
OH, CALL ME EVE.

454
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,760
REALLY?

455
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:15,039
ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S WHAT
ALL MY FRIENDS CALL ME, EVE.

456
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:19,561
FOR INSTANCE, UH,
TRINA, OVER THERE, TRINA.

457
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:23,462
SHE'S MY REALLY GOOD,
OLD FRIEND.

458
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,328
SHE'S BEEN WITH ME, LIKE,
12 WEEKS NOW.

459
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:29,399
- YEAH?
- MM-HMM.

460
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:32,471
WE TALK,
WE TALK ABOUT THINGS

461
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:38,062
LIKE OUR CAREERS, TRAVEL,
GUYS.

462
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,512
THAT'S NICE.

463
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,583
I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING
YOU THIS, BUT, UM.

464
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:47,417
SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE LIKES YOU.

465
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:51,075
- SHE DOES?
- MM-HMM.

466
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:54,424
IN FACT,
SHE USED THE WORD, "AWESOME."

467
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:55,682
THAT'S REALLY NICE OF HER.

468
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,565
TRINA'S SINGLE,
YOU KNOW.

469
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:59,429
RIGHT, NO,
I UNDERSTAND...

470
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:05,366
EVE, PLACES.

471
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:09,542
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

472
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:18,517
HI, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME
TO THE EVE LOVETT SHOW.

473
00:22:18,655 --> 00:22:22,521
I'M YOUR HOST,
EVE LOVETT.

474
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:24,419
HEY, VALENTINE'S DAY
IS COMING.

475
00:22:24,557 --> 00:22:26,387
AND WE ARE GOING
TO CELEBRATE IT

476
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:27,925
WITH A VERY SPECIAL WEEK
ON OUR SHOW

477
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:30,391
THAT WE LIKE TO CALL
"EVE'S WEEK OF LOVE."

478
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,117
CUE THE INSULIN.

479
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:34,855
AND WHAT BETTER WAY
TO KICK THINGS OFF,

480
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:37,121
IN TRUE VALENTINE FASHION,
THAN A VISIT FROM

481
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:42,541
OUR FAVORITE CELEBRITY CHEF,
ANTONIO CAPRICOLA.

482
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,165
CIAO, ANTONIO.

483
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:47,960
IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL
TIME OF THE YEAR.

484
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,617
SO FULL
OF LOVE AND ROMANCE.

485
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:51,204
OH, IT SURE IS.

486
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:52,872
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE FOR US TODAY?

487
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,484
WHEN I THINK
OF VALENTINE'S DAY,

488
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:57,314
I ALWAYS THINK OF CHOCOLATE.
MM.

489
00:22:57,452 --> 00:23:00,800
SO I AM MAKING A WONDERFUL,
OLD ITALIAN RECIPE

490
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:03,803
FOR HOT CHOCOLATO.

491
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:05,840
OH, IT SMELLS HEAVENLY.

492
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:11,639
WAIT UNTIL YOU TASTE IT.

493
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:16,506
OH, THAT IS AMAZING.

494
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,646
GRAZIE,
SI, SI, SI, SI.

495
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,406
IT IS TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY

496
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:21,944
ABOUT CHOCOLATE
BEING A LOVE POTION?

497
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:23,685
THAT'S WHAT
THE ANCIENTS BELIEVED.

498
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:25,411
AND IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THEM,

499
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:28,759
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

500
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,577
WELL, LET'S PUT IT
TO THE TEST, SHALL WE?

501
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:31,831
WHERE'S TRINA?
HONEY?

502
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:34,627
TRINA,
COME ON UP HERE.

503
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:36,698
AND, DOUG, YOU TOO,
COME ON UP HERE.

504
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,701
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
GIVE A WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE

505
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,496
FOR OUR BRILLIANT
SOUND MAN, DOUG,

506
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:43,498
AND MY PERSONAL
MAKEUP ARTIST, TRINA.

507
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:45,880
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

508
00:23:46,018 --> 00:23:49,642
UH, CAMERA ONE GO FOR TRINA,
THREE TAKE DOUG.

509
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:55,545
COME ON,
PUT THAT THING DOWN.

510
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,167
COME UP HERE,
YOU TWO.

511
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:00,377
WAIT UNTIL YOU TRY THIS,
IT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

512
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,483
GIVE THAT A SHOT THERE.

513
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,726
HERE WE GO.

514
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,764
HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

515
00:24:07,902 --> 00:24:10,456
- WOW.
- YUM.

516
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:12,009
SI, SI.

517
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:14,874
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TELL US IF IT REALLY WORKS.

518
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,394
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN
SUCH GOOD SPORTS

519
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:20,466
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER
YOU DINNER FOR TWO

520
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:23,504
AT MAURO RISTORANTE,
ONE OF THE MOST

521
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,471

522
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:29,924
THAT IS FOR YOU.

523
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:31,995
HAPPY VALENTINE'S WEEK,
EVERYONE.

524
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:35,481
ONE MORE ROUND OF APPLAUSE
FOR THESE TWO KIDS.

525
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:38,553
THEY MAKE THE MOST
ADORABLE COUPLE.

526
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:41,694
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL BE BACK.

527
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:49,426
EVE, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?

528
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:50,807
I HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME.

529
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:56,433
- WON'T TAKE A MINUTE.
- OH, OKAY.

530
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:59,505
WHAT WAS WITH THAT STUNT
YOU PULLED THIS AFTERNOON?

531
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:00,886
WHAT STUNT?

532
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:02,504
DRAGGING DOUG AND TRINA
UP ON STAGE.

533
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:03,830
WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE DOING?

534
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:05,200
OH, YOU SAID
IT WAS LOVE WEEK.

535
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,898
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
WATCHING TWO PEOPLE

536
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:08,248
FALL FOR EACH OTHER
WAS A GOOD WAY TO START.

537
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:09,619
- FALL FOR EACH OTHER?
- MM-HMM.

538
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,275
I'VE HAD MY EYE
ON THOSE TWO.

539
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:13,115
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
GOING ON BETWEEN THEM.

540
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,496
I WAS JUST GIVING THEM
A LITTLE NUDGE IS ALL.

541
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,832
- A LITTLE NUDGE?
- MM-HMM.

542
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,326
THEY WERE EVENTUALLY
GOING TO GET TOGETHER,

543
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,710
I JUST THOUGHT
I'D SPEED THINGS UP.

544
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:19,836
WELL, YOU SURE DID,
EVE.

545
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:21,423
DO YOU KNOW
DOUG IS ENGAGED?

546
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,804
- WHAT?
- TO MAUREEN.

547
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:24,634
- WHO'S MAUREEN?
- THE PROPS GIRL.

548
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:26,256
OH, I THOUGHT HER NAME
WAS ALICE.

549
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,785
THE POINT IS YOU JUST
SET UP HER FIANCEE

550
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,466
ON A DATE
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

551
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:30,916
OH, NO.

552
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:32,410
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW
THOSE TWO WERE ENGAGED?

553
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:33,834
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
REALIZE THEY HAD

554
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:34,924
TO CLEAR IT
WITH YOU FIRST.

555
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,128
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

556
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:37,681
I GOT TO GO TALK TO THEM.
NO.

557
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,165
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH
DAMAGE ALREADY.

558
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:40,511
HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

559
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,661
I WAS TRYING TO DO
A NICE THING.

560
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,514
I KNOW THAT, EVE.

561
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:45,769
BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE
TO BEHAVE LIKE A HUMAN BEING,

562
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:47,553
GIVE ME A HEADS-UP,
OKAY?

563
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:53,559
HEADS UP.

564
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:58,495
THANKS.

565
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:01,671
NOT AS EASY
AS IT LOOKS, HUH?

566
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:03,396
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

567
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:05,675
LONG ENOUGH.

568
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,953
HERE, HAVE A BON-BON.

569
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,472
I FIND CHOCOLATE TAKES
THE STING OFF FAILURE.

570
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:14,684
ALL RIT,
YEAH.

571
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:17,687
GOD, THEY WERE SO PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

572
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:19,481
WERE THEY?
REALLY?

573
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,346
OR WERE YOU JUST
TRYING TOO HARD?

574
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:24,763
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
- OF COURSE I'M RIGHT.

575
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,696
THIS IS MY
AREA OF EXPERTISE.

576
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,457
WELL, THEN
GIVE ME SOME TIPS.

577
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:31,355
OH, OKAY, WELL,
FIRST OFF.

578
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:33,703
WHAT DO YOU REALLY
KNOW ABOUT DOUG AND TRINA?

579
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:36,464
WELL,
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD KIDS.

580
00:26:36,602 --> 00:26:39,536
DOUG WANTS
TO BE A DIRECTOR.

581
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:40,710
AND TRINA...

582
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,470
WHAT ARE THEIR LAST NAMES?

583
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:44,368
EITHER ONE.
I DON'T KNOW.

584
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,715
WHERE ARE THEY FROM?

585
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,613
I DON'T KNOW.

586
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,546
WHAT ARE THEIR HOPES,
THEIR DREAMS,

587
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:50,823
THEIR DISAPPOINTMENTS?

588
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:53,688
I DO NOT KNOW.

589
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:56,484
EXACTLY.

590
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:59,280
THE ONLY THING YOU DO KNOW IS
WHAT RICK TOLD YOU ABOUT THEM.

591
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,351
YOU REALLY DO KNOW EVERYTHING,
DON'T YOU?

592
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:04,734
MM, NOT EVERYTHING,
JUST ENOUGH.

593
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,460
HERE,
HAVE ANOTHER BON-BON.

594
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:11,326
SEE, YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HELP ANYONE FALL IN LOVE,

595
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,915
INCLUDING YOURSELF,
UNTIL YOU FIND OUT

596
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:15,917
WHAT REALLY
MAKES PEOPLE TICK.

597
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:17,919
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

598
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,369
JUST LISTEN.

599
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,820
LET SOMEONE ELSE TALK
ONCE IN AWHILE.

600
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,580
TAKE AN INTEREST
IN SOMEBODY

601
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:27,826
OTHER THAN YOURSELF.

602
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:30,552
ALL RIGHT,
MAYBE I'LL TRY.

603
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,520
HMM, BETTER DO
MORE THAN THAT.

604
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:37,767
YOU ONLY GOT THREE DAYS
LEFT UNTIL VALENTINE'S.

605
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:43,531
BUT WHAT...

606
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,433
HI.

607
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:50,952
MAIL'S HERE.

608
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,954
YES,
I CAN SEE THAT.

609
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:54,956
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER
GET BACK TO WORK.

610
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:56,786
PLACE PRETTY MUCH SHUTS DOWN
WITHOUT ME.

611
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:58,063
NICE TO SEE YOU,
MISS LOVETT.

612
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,893
RITA, SEE YOU AROUND.
MMHMM.

613
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:18,462
OH, UH, MISS LOVETT.

614
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,809
YES?

615
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,465
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF I COULD LEAVE

616
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:22,432
A LITTLE BIT EARLY TONIGHT,
I HAVE A GAME.

617
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,847
A GAME?

618
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,545
YEAH, I COACH
A GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM.

619
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:27,644
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

620
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:28,932
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD INTEREST YOU.

621
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,440
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

622
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,580
RITA,
ARE YOU SINGLE?

623
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:33,995
UNFORTUNATELY,
YES.

624
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,479
NOTHING ON THE HORIZON,

625
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:36,836
NO SECRET BOYFRIENDS
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

626
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,449
NOPE, NOT A ONE.

627
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,520
- GOOD.
- I'M SORRY?

628
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:47,284
HOW WOULD LIKE A LITTLE
COMPANY AT YOUR GAME TONIGHT?

629
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:49,942
WE'LL SNEAK IN
A LITTLE GIRL TALK.

630
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:56,311
- OOH, OUR PIZZA'S HERE.
- OH, HERE WE GO.

631
00:28:56,431 --> 00:29:01,195
GET READY, GIRLS.
THANK YOU.

632
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,956
SO TELL ME ABOUT
THE GUY IN THE MAILROOM.

633
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:05,509
- BEN?
- MM-HMM.

634
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:06,890
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

635
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,685
OH, COME ON,
I SEE YOUR FACE LIGHT UP

636
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,445
WHEN HE COMES INTO A ROOM.

637
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,793
NOBODY GETS THAT EXCITED
ABOUT MAIL.

638
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,484
OH, IT'S THAT OBVIOUS?

639
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:15,692
SLIGHTLY.

640
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,522
DO YOU EVER,
YOU KNOW.

641
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,490
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, YOU AND HIM?

642
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:21,767
TOGETHER?

643
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:25,012
OH, NO,
I COULDN'T.

644
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,550
I MEAN, I SEE HIM
AT WORK EVERY DAY,

645
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,532
BUT I DON'T REALLY
KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM.

646
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,189
WELL, IS HE SINGLE?

647
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:32,364
YES.

648
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:33,742
WELL, YOU HAVE
THAT IN COMMON.

649
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,367
COME ON, WHAT ELSE?

650
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:38,508
I KNOW HE LIKES THE LAKERS
ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DO.

651
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:40,890
ALL RIGHT,
PERFECT.

652
00:29:41,028 --> 00:29:42,512
WHAT'S STOPPING YOU,
GIRL?

653
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,685
OH, MISS LOVETT.

654
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,240
I MEAN, EVE.

655
00:29:46,378 --> 00:29:48,587
I WOULD BE TOO SCARED
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

656
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:51,728
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO START.

657
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:54,662
WELL, YOU MAY NOT
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

658
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,319
OH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

659
00:29:56,457 --> 00:30:00,910
I DON'T KNOW,
FATE MAY LEND A HAND.

660
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,293
COMING.

661
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:07,675
COMING, I'M...

662
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:13,715
HERE I COME.

663
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,822
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT
QUESTION TO ASK YOU.

664
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,582
EVE, COME ON IN.

665
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,412
TELL ME,
WAS IT ONE GUY

666
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,414
WHO RUINED IT
FOR THE REST OF US,

667
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,589
OR DO YOU JUST SORT OF HATE
THE WHOLE SPECIES ON PRINCIPLE?

668
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:27,695
OH, RIGHT.

669
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:28,938
AM I INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

670
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,077
JUST SLEEP, EVE.

671
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:31,457
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

672
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,564
OKAY, LAKERS,
BASKETBALL, RIGHT?

673
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:35,876
YOU'RE KIDDING?

674
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:37,360
NO, I JUST...
I GET MIXED UP.

675
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,293
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST
IN SPORTS?

676
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:41,571
OH, WELL, I WAS OUT TONIGHT
WITH RITA.

677
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,986
YOUR ASSISTANT?

678
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:44,505
YEAH, WHY DOES THAT
SURPRISE YOU?

679
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,207
WELL, CONSIDERING
FOR THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS

680
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:47,631
YOU KNEW HER,
YOU CALLED HER BRENDA.

681
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,279
SO, WE WERE OUT,
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

682
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:51,753
WHAT HUGE FANS
OF THE LAKERS WE WERE.

683
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,352
A SECOND AGO, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT SPORT THEY PLAYED.

684
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,102
I TOLD YOU,
I GET CONFUSED.

685
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,313
I WANT TO TAKE RITA
TO ONE OF THOSE LAKERS MATCHES.

686
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:01,280
- THEY'RE CALLED GAMES.
- GAMES, RIGHT.

687
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,905
UM, SO, DO YOU JUST
GO THERE AND GET A TICKET?

688
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:10,393
OR DO YOU HAVE TO PHONE AHEAD
AND MAKE A RESERVATION?

689
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:12,440
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS
FOR YOU THROUGH THE COMPANY.

690
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:13,948
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I DON'T WANT

691
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:15,512
YOU TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH
ALL THE TROUBLE

692
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:17,641
OF PHONING AHEAD
AND MAKING A RESERVATION,

693
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,378
SO I WILL GET THE TICKETS
AND I WILL DROP THEM OFF

694
00:31:19,402 --> 00:31:20,448
AT YOUR OFFICE
TOMORROW MORNING.

695
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:21,818
AH, YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

696
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:23,889
SO WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT, ANYWAY?

697
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:25,339
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

698
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,893
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING.

699
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:29,722
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS
WHAT IT IS.

700
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,208
YOU'RE A VERY SUSPICIOUS MAN,
RICK DAYTON.

701
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:36,937
THAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE.

702
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,630
- NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

703
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,114
WOW.

704
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:50,122
GOOD MORNING,
CAROLYN.

705
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,745
REALLY?

706
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:05,655
GOOD MORNING, BEN.

707
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,139
MISS LOVETT.

708
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:10,211
MISS LOVETT?

709
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:11,626
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

710
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,800
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

711
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,802
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

712
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,907
QUITE THE CONTRARY.

713
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:18,299
I CAME DOWN TO TELL YOU WHAT
A GOOD JOB YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

714
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:23,880
OH, THANKS.

715
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:26,400
I WAS OUT WITH MY ASSISTANT,
RITA, LAST NIGHT.

716
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,885
YOU KNOW RITA,
MY ASSISTANT?

717
00:32:29,023 --> 00:32:30,369
AH, SURE.

718
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:32,751
WE WENT TO
ONE OF HER GAMES.

719
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,202
SHE COACHES A GIRLS BASKETBALL
TEAM, DID YOU KNOW THAT?

720
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,893
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

721
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:39,827
YEAH, SHE REALLY LOVES
HER BASKETBALL, THAT RITA.

722
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,415
REALLY INTO IT.

723
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:43,273
YOU'RE INTO BASKETBALL TOO,
AREN'T YOU, BEN?

724
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:45,557
UH, YEAH, ACTUALLY
I'M A PRETTY BIG LAKERS FAN.

725
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,076
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

726
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:49,388
SHE... SHE ACTUALLY
MENTIONED THAT.

727
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:50,838
SHE DID?

728
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:52,978
TALKED QUITE A BIT
ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT.

729
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:55,256
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

730
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:58,984
BEN, COULD YOU
DO ME A SMALL FAVOR?

731
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:00,537
ANYTHING, MISS LOVETT.

732
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:02,401
ALL RIGHT,
I HAVE A PACKAGE

733
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:05,404
THAT ABSOLUTELY
HAS TO GO OUT THIS MORNING.

734
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:08,994
SO IF YOU COULD MEET ME
IN MY OFFICE IN ABOUT, UH,

735
00:33:09,132 --> 00:33:10,351
TEN MINUTES?
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

736
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,446
ALL RIGHT.

737
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:15,552
TEN MINUTES,
DON'T BE LATE.

738
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:25,252
MISS LOVETT.

739
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,470
- GOOD MORNING, ALICE.
- IT'S MAUREEN.

740
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:28,876
OH, MAUREEN.
MAUREEN.

741
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:30,429
DO...
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

742
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,776
CERTAINLY, YES,
ABSOLUTELY.

743
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:34,295
IT'S ABOUT YOU
PAYING FOR DINNER

744
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:35,917
FOR TRINA
AND MY FIANCEE LAST NIGHT.

745
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,368
THAT, I AM SO,
SO SORRY.

746
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,302
IT WAS JUST A TERRIBLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

747
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,478
AND, MAUREEN,
I AM SICK ABOUT IT.

748
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:47,308
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU SOMEHOW.

749
00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:49,897
PERHAPS IF I, UM,
COULD BUY DINNER

750
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:51,312
FOR YOU AND DOUG.

751
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,865
OH, NO,
I DON'T THINK SO.

752
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,883
WELL, PLEASE, IT WOULD
MAKE ME FEEL SO BETTER.

753
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:56,386
NO, I MEAN,
DINNER WOULD BE GREAT.

754
00:33:56,524 --> 00:33:58,457
BUT NOT WITH DOUG.
BEG PARDON?

755
00:33:58,595 --> 00:33:59,779
HE AND TRINA
STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT.

756
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:03,807
OH, OH,
OH, NO.

757
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,785
YOU ACTUALLY DID ME
A REALLY BIG FAVOR THOUGH,

758
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,925
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOWED ME
WHAT KIND OF GUY DOUG REALLY IS.

759
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:09,813
TO THINK I ALMOST MARRIED
THAT CREEP.

760
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:12,644
THANKS, MISS LOVETT.

761
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:16,579
OH, SURE,
NO PROBLEM, BRENDA.

762
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:18,591
OKAY, COULD YOU GIVE THESE
TO HER WHEN SHE GETS IN, PLEASE?

763
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:20,928
BUT LISTEN...
I'M HERE, I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

764
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,481
HI, MORNING MISS LOV...
EVE.

765
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:23,379
SORRY, I'M STILL
GETTING USED TO THAT.

766
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:24,932
GET USED TO IT.

767
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,910
- THIS IS YOUR LUCKY DAY.
- OH, DON'T I KNOW IT.

768
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,487
COME ON, GET IN THERE.

769
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:31,352
RITA, I'M EXPECTING
A VERY IMPORTANT PACKAGE

770
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,606
THIS MORNING, SO I NEED YOU TO
STAY RIGHT THERE AT YOUR DESK.

771
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,149
UNDERSTAND?
DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DESK.

772
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:39,291
GOT IT.

773
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,155
OKAY, HI.

774
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:42,363
HI.

775
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:43,951
ARE THOSE MY TICKETS?

776
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:47,368
YES, TOOK ALL MY CHARM
AND POWERS OF PERSUASION,

777
00:34:47,506 --> 00:34:49,484
BUT YOU ARE NOW THE PROUD OWNER
OF TWO LUXURY BOX SEATS

778
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:51,821
FOR TONIGHT'S
LAKERS, CELTICS GAME.

779
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,857
- IS THAT GOOD?
- EVE, MOST PEOPLE WOULD

780
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,377
GIVE THEIR FIRST BORN CHILD
FOR THOSE TICKETS.

781
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:58,690
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

782
00:34:58,828 --> 00:35:02,659
YOU'RE WELCOME,
WELCOME.

783
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:10,391
SO, UM, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

784
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:11,875
I... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

785
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:14,395
I MEAN, WHY A WOMAN
WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD

786
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,880
ABSOLUTELY ZERO INTEREST
IN ANY SPORT,

787
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:20,229
OTHER THAN A PEDICURE,
IS SUDDENLY A LAKERS FAN.

788
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,369
- HI, BEN.
- HI, RITA.

789
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:24,992
- HE'S HERE.
- WHO'S HERE?

790
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,132
CAN'T YOU DO
ANYTHING RIGHT?

791
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,030
WHAT?

792
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,008
I TOLD YOU I WANTED THESE
TICKETS FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

793
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:32,482
YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

794
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,381
THIS IS GREAT,
THIS IS JUST GREAT.

795
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,003
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

796
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:37,522
SOMETHING?
EVERYTHING.

797
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,352
I ASKED MY PRODUCER HERE
TO GET ME TICKETS

798
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,354
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT'S
LAKERS, "CEDRICS" GAME.

799
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:43,873
I THINK YOU MEAN CELTICS.

800
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,565
AND INSTEAD, HE GOT ME
TWO LUXURY BOX CARS

801
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,050
FOR TONIGHT'S GAME AND HE KNOWS
THAT I HAVE A CONFLICT.

802
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,914
- I DO?
- YES, YOU DO.

803
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:52,375
YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE
THE THING WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

804
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,779
WHAT PEOPLE?

805
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,550
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW,
BECAUSE THE POINT IS,

806
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,438
I CAN NOT GO
TO THE MATCH.

807
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,268
- GAME.
- I CAN'T GO TO EITHER ONE.

808
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:00,866
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THESE TICKETS?

809
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,271
WELL, LOOK,
I'LL JUST TAKE...

810
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:03,893
OH, MY...
I HAVE JUST HAD

811
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:07,448
THE MOST BRILLIANT IDEA,
WHOA, I'M GOOD.

812
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:09,392
RITA, WOULD YOU BE A DOLL
AND TAKE THESE TICKETS

813
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,521
OFF MY HANDS?
I WOULD LOVE TO.

814
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:14,973
OKAY, NOW THERE'S
JUST ONE PROBLEM.

815
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:18,459
IS THERE ARE TWO TICKETS
AND IT'S AWFULLY LATE NOTICE

816
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:22,463
TO TRY TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE
TO BE IN THE OTHER SEAT.

817
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:25,294
WHAT ABOUT...
HMM.

818
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,123
HOW ABOUT YOU,
BEN?

819
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:30,299
YOU WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED
IN GOING TO THE GAME, WOULD YOU?

820
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:31,714
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WOULD...

821
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,302
OKAY, RITA,
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

822
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,717
BEN GOING WITH YOU
TO THE GAME?

823
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:36,477
NO, I MEAN,
YES, YES.

824
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,495
REALLY? I MEAN,
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

825
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:39,480
ALL RIGHT, LOOK AT
WHAT I JUST DID.

826
00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:40,861
IT'S SETTLED THEN.

827
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,690
ALL RIGHT,
NOW WHY DON'T YOU TWO

828
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:45,935
TAKE A NICE COFFEE BREAK
AND IRON OUT ALL THE DETAILS.

829
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,627
AND... OH, I JUST HAD
ANOTHER BRILLIANT IDEA.

830
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,008
HOW ABOUT THIS,
AFTER THE GAME,

831
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:52,321
DINNER AT MAURO'S?
ON ME.

832
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,462
OKAY, THIS IS OFFICIALLY
THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

833
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,636
AND IT'S STILL EARLY,
SO GO ON, YOU TWO, SCOOT.

834
00:36:57,774 --> 00:37:01,088
YOU CRAZY KIDS.
CRAZY KIDS, YEAH.

835
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:03,642
SO YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
A CONFLICT TONIGHT, DO YOU?

836
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,163
WELL, THAT'S A MATTER
OF OPINION NOW, ISN'T IT?

837
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:09,890
OKAY, THIS AVERAGE DAY JUST
TURNED INTO THE BEST DAY EVER.

838
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,480
ABSOLUTELY, BEST DAY
IN THE WORKFORCE.

839
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:15,723
YOURS ESPECIALLY.

840
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:16,336
I WAS JUST, UH...
JUST CHECKING THE PLANTS.

841
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:19,477
THIS ONE'S GOOD.

842
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:23,412
IT'S OKAY.

843
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,425
THE LAST GAME I WENT TO,
I WAS, LIKE, FOUR YEARS OLD.

844
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:38,081
- IT WAS?
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

845
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,083
- THAT'S AWESOME.
- IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING.

846
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:41,706
I HEAR FISH IS BACK.

847
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:44,536
WELL, YEAH, HOPEFULLY
I CAN GET AN AUTOGRAPH.

848
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:05,454
WAIT, YOU HAVE
THIS LITTLE PIECE OF FOAM.

849
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,283
SHOULD I?
I'M JUST GOING TO...

850
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,734
OH, ON MY NOSE?

851
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:13,807
YES.

852
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:16,465
UM, BUT, UH,
YEAH, THIS WAY.

853
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,743
OKAY, YEAH.
I CAN WALK?

854
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,572
YES.

855
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:32,308
HI, I WAS JUST CHECKING
ALL THE PLANTS AND THE...

856
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:34,793
THIS WHOLE THING
LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

857
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,382
SO...

858
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,904
CARRY ON.

859
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:51,845
I DID IT.

860
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:54,503
I REALLY DID IT.

861
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:58,127
- EVE?
- YES.

862
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,646
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

863
00:39:59,784 --> 00:40:05,514
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

864
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:25,430
VERNON.

865
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:27,190
HOW'D YOU GUESS?

866
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:29,469
BECAUSE NO ONE SENT ME
ROSES IN 100 YEARS.

867
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:30,849
AW, THAT'S SAD.

868
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,541
PITY I HAVE TO TAKE
THEM BACK.

869
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,474
WHAT? WHY?

870
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,382
WELL, THEY'RE FROM THE HEAD
OFFICE TO CONGRATULATE YOU

871
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:38,719
ON THE SUCCESSFUL
COMPLETION OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT.

872
00:40:38,857 --> 00:40:40,283
WELL, THEN WHY DON'T
I GET TO KEEP THEM?

873
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:41,619
BECAUSE YOU AREN'T DONE YET.

874
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:44,276
OH, BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN,
MY FRIEND.

875
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:50,386
COME HERE,
I GOT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

876
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:52,871
HUH? HUH?

877
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:55,874
LOOKS LIKE LOVE TO ME.
OH, IT IS.

878
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:57,572
I'VE CHECKED OUT
THEIR PAPERWORK ALREADY

879
00:40:57,669 --> 00:40:59,336
AND THEY'RE A PERFECT MATCH,
CONGRATULATIONS.

880
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,501
SO WHY ARE YOU SAYING
I'M NOT DONE?

881
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,541
COME OVER HERE.

882
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,510
MAUREEN'S NOT HAPPY.

883
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,891
UH-OH.

884
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:15,756
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
THE ENGAGEMENT'S OFF.

885
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:18,759
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
COMPANY POLICY SAYS

886
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:21,313
THAT THIS ONE CANCELS OUT
THE OTHER ONE,

887
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:24,489
SO I'M SORRY, EVE,
BUT YOU'RE BACK AT ZERO AGAIN.

888
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:25,766
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

889
00:41:25,904 --> 00:41:27,906
NO ONE SAID
LOVE IS FAIR.

890
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:30,253
HERE,
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP ONE?

891
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:32,601
WHY? TO REMIND ME
THAT I'M A FAILURE?

892
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:34,188
NOW, NOW.

893
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,363
IT'S NO TIME
TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF.

894
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:42,542
YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO DAYS LEFT,
LOVE'S A WAITING.

895
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,995
BUT, VERNON,
CAN I AT LEAST...

896
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:52,793
VERNON?

897
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:01,526
NIGHT, MISS LOVETT.

898
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:03,045
OH, GOOD NIGHT,
VINCE.

899
00:42:03,183 --> 00:42:05,806
THAT'S VANCE, BUT
YOU'RE REAL CLOSE THOUGH.

900
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:08,775
OH, I'M STARTING TO REALIZE
CLOSE DOESN'T COUNT.

901
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:09,741
ROUGH DAY, HUH?

902
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:11,640
IT SHOWS?

903
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:13,573
THIS WHOLE VALENTINE'S
THING GOT YOU DOWN?

904
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:15,057
MM, HOW YOU'D KNOW?

905
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:19,475
IT HAS THAT AFFECT
ON US SINGLE PEOPLE.

906
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:22,409
YOU'RE SINGLE?

907
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:26,827
GUILTY AS CHARGED,
YEAH.

908
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:29,589
YOU, UH,
SEEING ANYONE?

909
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,661
NO, I ACTUALLY GAVE UP
ON THAT WHOLE DATING SCENE.

910
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:34,628
COME ON, YOU?

911
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:37,838
PLEASE, WHAT HAPPENED?

912
00:42:37,976 --> 00:42:41,497
IT'S A LONG STORY,
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

913
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:45,570
TRY ME.

914
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,588
EVE, I THOUGHT WE AGREED
YOU WERE GOING TO RUN

915
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,573
THIS KIND OF THING
BY ME FIRST.

916
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:49,711
THERE WASN'T TIME.

917
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:51,196
IT'S FRESH, IT'S ORIGINAL.

918
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:53,613
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

919
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:55,970
TRUST ME, THERE ISN'T GOING
TO BE A DRY EYE IN THE HOUSE.

920
00:42:55,994 --> 00:42:58,756
I JUST HAVE A BAD FEELING IN
THE PIT OF STOMACH ABOUT THIS.

921
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:02,518
YEAH?
ASK THE NURSE FOR SOME BROMO.

922
00:43:02,656 --> 00:43:08,766
WE HAVE A SHOW TO DO.

923
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:11,354
HI THERE, WELCOME BACK
TO THE EVE LOVETT SHOW

924
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:14,392
AND WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL SEGMENT

925
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,360
FOR OUR VALENTINE'S WEEK
CALLED, "CUPID AT LARGE."

926
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:20,709
OUR GUEST TODAY IS ONE
OF OUR VERY OWN STAFF MEMBERS,

927
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:23,884
VANCE FRYMAN,
WELCOME HIM, EVERYBODY.

928
00:43:24,022 --> 00:43:29,614
IS THIS A HANDSOME
GENTLEMAN OR WHAT?

929
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:33,445
CAMERA TWO PUSH IN
ON THE HUNK.

930
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,137
I KNOW
HOW TO PICK THEM.

931
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:37,864
SO WELCOME, VANCE, UM,
LISTEN I'M GOING JUMP RIGHT IN.

932
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:39,451
- PLEASE.
- OKAY.

933
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:43,835
YOU'RE NEARING 40 AND, UH,
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.

934
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:45,803
UM, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

935
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:47,632
YOU GUN-SHY?

936
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:52,672
NO, ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL.
TRUTH IS I JUST HAVEN'T MET

937
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,926
THAT PERSON THAT I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

938
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,366
OH, WELL, AND WHY
DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

939
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:01,542
UM, BECAUSE NONE OF THEM
WERE LAURA.

940
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,406
I SEE.

941
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:07,376
UH, WHY DON'T YOU LET
THE AUDIENCE KNOW WHO LAURA IS.

942
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:09,516
SURE, UM.

943
00:44:09,654 --> 00:44:15,418
LAURA WAS, UH... SHE WAS
THE FIRST GIRL I EVER KISSED.

944
00:44:15,556 --> 00:44:16,937
SHE WAS MY FIRST LOVE.

945
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:19,595
AND WOULD YOU GO SO FAR
AS TO SAY, PERHAPS,

946
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:21,839
THAT SHE WAS YOUR ONLY LOVE
ALL THESE YEARS?

947
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:24,600
OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY,
ABSOLUTELY.

948
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:26,095
AND WHY AREN'T
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER?

949
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,845
WELL, EVE,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

950
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:30,502
I'VE WANTED
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT, BUT...

951
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,542
SEE, LAURA AND I
WERE HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS.

952
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,900
AND I KNEW THE MOMENT I MET HER
THAT SHE WAS MY SOUL MATE.

953
00:44:37,924 --> 00:44:39,960
YOU SEEM PRETTY SURE OF THAT.

954
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:43,861
WELL, I WAS, AND I AM
STILL, EVEN TO THIS DAY.

955
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:46,795
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
FOR SOME REASON,

956
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:49,487
HER FATHER
DISAPPROVED OF ME.

957
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,258
SO WE, OF COURSE,
SNUCK AROUND HIM AT TIMES

958
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:53,002
SO WE COULD SEE EACH OTHER,
BUT TO NO AVAIL.

959
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:55,804
HE FINALLY JUST MOVED
THE WHOLE FAMILY OUT OF STATE.

960
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:58,668
JUST TO KEEP
THE TWO OF YOU APART.

961
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,543
I MEAN, I TRIED TO KEEP IN
TOUCH WITH LAURA OVER THE YEARS

962
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,258
BY SENDING HER LETTERS.

963
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:05,606
BUT, UH, MY LETTERS WERE ALWAYS
RETURNED, "ADDRESS UNKNOWN."

964
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,505
SO SAD.

965
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,843
YEAH, SPENT THE LAST 20 YEARS
TRYING TO FIND HER BUT...

966
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,060
NO LUCK?

967
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:13,822
NO, NO,
UNFORTUNATELY SHE A...

968
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,616
IT'S LIKE SHE
JUST DISAPPEARED.

969
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,447
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY,
VANCE, IF I TOLD YOU THAT

970
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:21,622
WE FOUND HER?

971
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,048
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

972
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:25,005
YOUR LAURA.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

973
00:45:25,143 --> 00:45:26,627
I AM SERIOUS.

974
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,010
OUR CRACK RESEARCH TEAM
HAS TRACKED HER DOWN.

975
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:33,565
YOU GOT TO BE...
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

976
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:34,946
NO, IT GETS BETTER.

977
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:36,534
SHE FEELS THE SAME WAY
THAT YOU DO.

978
00:45:36,672 --> 00:45:39,399
YOU ARE THE ONE GREAT LOVE
OF HER LIFE.

979
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,952
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

980
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,851
- WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THIS.
- WHAT?

981
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:45,439
WE HAVE BROUGHT HER
HERE TODAY.

982
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,477
TO GET THE TWO OF YOU
RE-UNITED.

983
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,306
WHAT?

984
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:54,552
- SHE'S HERE.
- SHE'S HERE?

985
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,554
SHE'S HERE.
KEEP THAT APPLAUSE GOING.

986
00:45:56,692 --> 00:45:58,763
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
GIVE A WARM, EVE SHOWWELCOME

987
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:02,974
TO MISS LAURA WILSON.

988
00:46:08,738 --> 00:46:10,533
HELLO, VANCE.

989
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:12,363
- WHAT?
- COME ON, ROMEO,

990
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:14,192
DON'T BE SHY,
GET OVER THERE.

991
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,229
NO, THAT'S NOT LAURA,
THAT'S DIDI.

992
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:18,887
THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN
STALKING ME FOR TWO YEARS NOW.

993
00:46:19,025 --> 00:46:20,785
- WHAT?
- THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.

994
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:22,004
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
VANCE.

995
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:23,512
ACTUALLY,
NOT LONG ENOUGH.

996
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,824
IS THIS TRUE?

997
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,170
YES, SHE'S BEEN
CHARGED TWICE

998
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:27,688
FOR IDENTITY THEFT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

999
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,621
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
I NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

1000
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:31,323
NO, STAY AWAY FROM ME,
DON'T COME NEAR ME.

1001
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:32,555
FOLLOW ON CAMERA THREE.

1002
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,557
TWO, STAY WITH THE PSYCHO.

1003
00:46:34,695 --> 00:46:36,087
YOU KNOW I HAVE
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

1004
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:37,560
OH, THAT SILLY
LITTLE THING.

1005
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:39,666
NO, THE POLICE,
CALL THE POLICE, RIGHT NOW.

1006
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:42,324
RIGHT NOW.

1007
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:46,328
OKAY, UH, LAURA, DIDI,
WHATEVER.

1008
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:47,788
IF WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS
LIKE RATIONAL ADULTS.

1009
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:49,262
SECURITY.

1010
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,575
YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER.

1011
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:55,924
GET RID OF HER,
DON'T LET HER GO.

1012
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:57,753
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT APPEARS THAT OUR

1013
00:46:57,891 --> 00:47:01,722
RESEARCH TEAM HAS MADE
A TINY LITTLE MISTAKE.

1014
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,286
SHE'S STRONGER THAN SHE LOOKS,
HOLD ON TO HER, PLEASE.

1015
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,865
YOU KNOW I HATE
YELLOW TOO.

1016
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:08,246
DON'T LET HER GO,
GET HER OUT OF MY LIFE.

1017
00:47:08,384 --> 00:47:09,730
EVE, EVE,
WHY'D YOU DO THIS TO ME?

1018
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:13,044
WE'LL BE BACK,
RIGHT AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

1019
00:47:18,394 --> 00:47:20,741
RICK.

1020
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:27,093
THEY TOOK THE TAPE,
FOR EVIDENCE.

1021
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,715
HAVE TO AIR A RE-RUN.

1022
00:47:28,853 --> 00:47:30,382
NOT THAT THE RATINGS
COULD GET MUCH LOWER.

1023
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,581
- OKAY, JUST SAY IT.
- SAY WHAT?

1024
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:33,858
"I TOLD YOU SO."

1025
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:35,791
I KNOW YOU'RE
JUST DYING TO.

1026
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:37,010
YOU JUST DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

1027
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:38,311
WHAT?

1028
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:41,728
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM.

1029
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:45,283
RICK.

1030
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:47,078
I'M SORRY.

1031
00:47:47,216 --> 00:47:49,322
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1032
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:55,293
I THINK YOU
REALLY MEAN THAT.

1033
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:58,296
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL MAKE IT UP
IN THE LIVE BROADCAST.

1034
00:47:58,434 --> 00:48:00,333
- REALLY THINK SO?
- YEAH.

1035
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:05,096
I HAVE FAITH
IN OUR HOST.

1036
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:27,325
- YOU KNOW...
- AAH!

1037
00:48:27,463 --> 00:48:29,672
I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU HAD THAT ONE.

1038
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,847
COULD YOU AT LEAST...
HONK OR SOMETHING?

1039
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:34,505
SORRY.

1040
00:48:34,643 --> 00:48:36,265
AND THAT WAS
NOT MY FAULT.

1041
00:48:36,403 --> 00:48:38,026
MM... IN A WAY,
IT SORT OF WAS.

1042
00:48:38,164 --> 00:48:39,751
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

1043
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,376
I HAVE 24 HOURS BEFORE...
ACCORDING TO YOU...

1044
00:48:43,514 --> 00:48:45,033
I LOSE ANY CHANCE
I'LL EVER HAVE

1045
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:47,380
AT FINDING LOVE.
PRECISELY.

1046
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:49,796
SO STOP WASTING YOUR TIME
LOOKING AT THE PETALS.

1047
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:52,143
YOU'RE MISSING
THE ROSE.

1048
00:48:53,627 --> 00:48:57,424
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN, VERNON?

1049
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:01,946
VERNON?

1050
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:04,707
WILL YOU STOP DOING THAT?

1051
00:49:04,845 --> 00:49:07,158
VERNON?

1052
00:49:12,508 --> 00:49:15,339
VERNON?

1053
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:22,103
YOU ALL RIGHT,
CAROLYN?

1054
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:23,381
OH.

1055
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:25,418
OH, YEAH.

1056
00:49:25,556 --> 00:49:27,696
EVERYTHING'S JUST
SUNSHINE AND BUTTERCUPS.

1057
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,180
OKAY.

1058
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:31,251
AND IT'S JANICE.

1059
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:35,704
EXCUSE ME?

1060
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:39,397
MY NAME IS JANICE.

1061
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:40,985
NOT THAT
IT REALLY MATTERS.

1062
00:49:41,123 --> 00:49:43,746
I'M JUST
THE RECEPTIONIST, RIGHT?

1063
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:46,508
NO...
IT MATTERS.

1064
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:49,718
IT MATTERS.

1065
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:50,856
THANKS.

1066
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:57,864
YOU WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT?

1067
00:49:58,002 --> 00:50:00,004
WHAT, THIS?

1068
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:02,455
IT'S JUST ALLERGIES.

1069
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:04,250
I'M ALLERGIC
TO BROKEN HEARTS.

1070
00:50:04,388 --> 00:50:05,872
WELL, WHO ISN'T?

1071
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,289
CAN I SHOW YOU
SOMETHING?

1072
00:50:15,157 --> 00:50:18,885
OH.
HE'S... CUTE.

1073
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:20,507
LOOK AT HIM.
AW.

1074
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:21,750
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

1075
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,027
GUS.

1076
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:24,477
GUS.

1077
00:50:24,615 --> 00:50:26,789
HE'S PROBABLY
THE BEST FRIEND I'VE EVER HAD.

1078
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:29,309
WELL, I'D LIKE
TO MEET HIM SOMETIME.

1079
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:32,450
I WISH YOU COULD,
BUT...

1080
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:34,245
I HAD TO PUT HIM
TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

1081
00:50:34,383 --> 00:50:36,972
OH, I'M SORRY.

1082
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,594
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1083
00:50:38,732 --> 00:50:41,597
OH, YOU... PROBABLY THINK
THIS IS PRETTY STUPID,

1084
00:50:41,735 --> 00:50:43,806
ME HIDING OUT
IN HERE.

1085
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:45,325
I JUST...

1086
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:47,983
I COULDN'T GET
THROUGH THE DAY.

1087
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:51,711
IT'S NOT STUPID.

1088
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,368
WELL, IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW,

1089
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:54,931
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.

1090
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:57,268
LOVE DOESN'T COME ALONG
EVERY DAY, AND...

1091
00:50:57,406 --> 00:50:58,994
BUT WITH GUS...

1092
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:00,582
JUST HAVING HIM AROUND,

1093
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,344
HE SEEMED TO TAKE THE LONELINESS
AWAY A LITTLE BIT.

1094
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:19,152
MISS LOVETT?

1095
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,292
CALL ME EVE.

1096
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,500
OKAY, EVE?

1097
00:51:22,638 --> 00:51:24,882
YES?

1098
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,815
IF YOU EVER TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS,

1099
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:29,818
I'LL DECK YA.

1100
00:51:33,304 --> 00:51:37,032
SHH...

1101
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,483
VANCE,
VANCE!

1102
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,314
HOW DID YOU SEE IT?

1103
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:44,902
THE POLICE
HAVE THE TAPE.

1104
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,121
SOMEONE IN YOUR AUDIENCE
HAD A CELL PHONE CAMERA.

1105
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,525
IT'S GONE VIRAL.

1106
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:49,113
OH, NO.

1107
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,425
OH, YES.

1108
00:51:50,563 --> 00:51:51,763
YOU'VE HAD
HALF A MILLION HITS.

1109
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,186
YOU'RE AN INTERNET
SENSATION.

1110
00:51:55,257 --> 00:51:56,983
I DON'T FEEL
VERY SENSATIONAL.

1111
00:51:57,121 --> 00:51:58,571
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW?

1112
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:00,342
UGH, YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE IT IF I TOLD YOU.

1113
00:52:00,366 --> 00:52:01,608
I BET I CAN GUESS.

1114
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:03,472
IT'S ABOUT VALENTINE'S DAY,
ISN'T IT?

1115
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,405
- IN A WAY.
- I KNEW IT.

1116
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:06,658
YOU'RE FEELING THE CLOCK
TICKING, AREN'T YOU?

1117
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:08,167
WHAT?

1118
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,479
YOU'VE COME TO A POINT
IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU REALIZE

1119
00:52:10,617 --> 00:52:12,412
YOU'VE CUT YOURSELF OFF
FROM LOVE.

1120
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,069
NANCY,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

1121
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,207
AND YOU FEEL, IF YOU DON'T
REACH OUT AND GRAB IT,

1122
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:17,635
YOU MAY NEVER HAVE
THE CHANCE AGAIN.

1123
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:19,005
HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

1124
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:20,703
IF YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS,

1125
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,560
WHY ARE YOU STILL SINGLE?
PERSONAL CHOICE.

1126
00:52:22,698 --> 00:52:24,562
I'M NOT READY TO SETTLE
FOR SECOND BEST.

1127
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,426
OH, AND YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD?

1128
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:29,429
I'M SAYING, BECAUSE OF
A FEW BAD EXPERIENCES,

1129
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,535
YOU HAVE LET LIFE
PASS YOU BY.

1130
00:52:31,673 --> 00:52:35,263
YOU NEED TO OPEN YOURSELF UP,
LET LOVE IN.

1131
00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:37,437
YEAH, YEAH.

1132
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:39,055
HEY, NANCE,
I'VE GOT TO CALL YOU BACK.

1133
00:52:39,128 --> 00:52:40,578
WHAT?

1134
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:42,384
BUT WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO MAKE A BREAKTHROUGH.

1135
00:52:42,408 --> 00:52:45,618
UH, I'VE GOT TO GO SEE
A MAN ABOUT A DOG.

1136
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:48,931
EVE? A DOG IS NOT
A REPLACEMENT FOR A MAN.

1137
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:50,278
AS A RULE.

1138
00:52:56,387 --> 00:52:58,507
THIS IS A VERY NICE THING
YOU'RE DOING, MISS LOVETT.

1139
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:00,357
PLEASE,
CALL ME EVE.

1140
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:02,175
WELL, HOW ABOUT
YOU CALL ME HARVEY, THEN?

1141
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,601
YOU GOT A DEAL,
HARVEY.

1142
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:05,085
YEAH...

1143
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,501
THE DAY
YOU LOSE A DOG

1144
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:09,124
IS A BAD DAY
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT.

1145
00:53:09,262 --> 00:53:10,895
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
NEVER GET OVER IT.

1146
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:12,414
THEY GO THROUGH
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES

1147
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:14,888
WITH THIS CANINE-SHAPED HOLE
IN THEM.

1148
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,477
THAT'S WHY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
FOR THIS LADY,

1149
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:20,135
TRYING TO FIND ONE
THAT FILLS THE SPACE,

1150
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:22,033
SHOWS THAT YOU'RE
A VERY GOOD FRIEND TO HAVE.

1151
00:53:22,137 --> 00:53:23,770
OH, HARVEY, I HAVEN'T
BEEN MUCH OF A FRIEND.

1152
00:53:23,794 --> 00:53:25,354
THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

1153
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:26,969
WELL, IT'S A GREAT PLACE
TO START.

1154
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:28,107
AS MY WIFE USED TO SAY,

1155
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:29,593
WE SHOULD
ALL ASPIRE TO BE

1156
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:32,492
THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT
OUR DOGS THINK WE ARE.

1157
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,011
YOUR WIFE'S A SMART LADY.

1158
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:37,325
SHE GAVE ME MY FIRST DOG,
A MUTT NAMED TOM.

1159
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:38,533
THAT LED ME
TO THIS PLACE.

1160
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:40,500
AND, UH...
IT'S INTERESTING.

1161
00:53:40,638 --> 00:53:42,399
'CAUSE IT'S HARD
SOMETIMES.

1162
00:53:42,537 --> 00:53:43,779
PEOPLE CAN BE
VERY CRUEL.

1163
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:46,506
BUT THEN SOMEONE LIKE YOU
COMES ALONG

1164
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:48,059
AND MAKES IT
ALL WORTHWHILE.

1165
00:53:48,197 --> 00:53:51,339
NOW... THIS IS THE FELLA
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

1166
00:53:51,477 --> 00:53:53,410
HE'S NOT A PUREBRED,
AS YOU CAN SEE.

1167
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:55,148
A LITTLE BIT OF THIS,
LITTLE BIT OF THAT,

1168
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:56,551
BUT A WHOLE LOT
OF LOVE.

1169
00:53:56,689 --> 00:53:58,794
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1170
00:53:58,932 --> 00:54:01,625
HARVEY,
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

1171
00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:05,456
FINGERS CROSSED, HUH?

1172
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:09,046
EVE, I TOLD YOU.

1173
00:54:09,184 --> 00:54:10,864
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.
IT'S JUST TOO SOON.

1174
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:12,705
I UNDERSTAND.
JUST HUMOR ME.

1175
00:54:12,843 --> 00:54:14,603
IT'LL ONLY TAKE
A MINUTE, OKAY?

1176
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:15,432
COME ON.

1177
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:18,366
GET READY.

1178
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:21,092
JANICE, I WOULD LIKE
FOR YOU TO MEET...

1179
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:27,478
- HARVEY?
- Y-YOU KNOW HIM?

1180
00:54:27,616 --> 00:54:29,377
JAYCEE.

1181
00:54:29,515 --> 00:54:31,137
HARVEY MITFORD,
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

1182
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:32,380
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

1183
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:33,691
IN THE FLESH.

1184
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:35,279
OF COURSE,
A LITTLE MORE FLESH

1185
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:36,857
THAN THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW ME, BUT...

1186
00:54:36,936 --> 00:54:39,387
HOW DO YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

1187
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:40,812
WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
TOGETHER.

1188
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:43,045
WE WERE QUITE
THE HOT ITEM,

1189
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:44,816
BACK IN THE DAY,
WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH.

1190
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,740
AS I REMEMBER,
I WASN'T YOUR ONLY HOT ITEM.

1191
00:54:47,878 --> 00:54:50,087
HARVEY WAS A BIT OF
A LADIES' MAN AT SCHOOL.

1192
00:54:50,225 --> 00:54:52,331
CAN'T BLAME THE GIRLS
FOR HAVING GOOD TASTE, HMM?

1193
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:54,574
AND ONE OF THEM
GOT YOU TOO.

1194
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:56,024
HOW IS ALICE?

1195
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:59,027
SHE PASSED.

1196
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,339
12 YEARS AGO.

1197
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:01,719
I'M SORRY.

1198
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:04,481
NO, I THANK MY LUCKY STARS
EVERY DAY

1199
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:06,414
FOR HAVING KNOWN HER.

1200
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:08,726
AND NOW I GET TO WORK
WITH THESE GUYS.

1201
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:11,591
SO THIS IS THE LITTLE FELLA
YOU WANTED ME TO SEE?

1202
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:13,559
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
UM, DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

1203
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,077
YOU WANT TO NAME HIM?

1204
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:20,082
I DON'T KNOW.

1205
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,429
I CAN'T REPLACE GUS.

1206
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,327
THIS WOULDN'T BE
REPLACING GUS.

1207
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:24,742
THIS IS SOMETHING NEW.

1208
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,434
BESIDES,
EVERYBODY DESERVES

1209
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:29,402
A FRESH START
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

1210
00:55:46,937 --> 00:55:50,389
WELL, THAT WAS
CERTAINLY UNEXPECTED.

1211
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,114
HEY.

1212
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:53,920
WHAT DOES THE HEAD OFFICE
THINK OF THAT NOW, HUH?

1213
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:55,584
OH, THE HEAD OFFICE
DEFINITELY APPROVES.

1214
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:56,957
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

1215
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:58,604
YES.

1216
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:00,088
SO DO I GET
MY FLOWERS NOW?

1217
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:02,124
- NOPE.
- WHAT?

1218
00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:04,126
I'M SORRY, EVE,
BUT THE RULES ARE VERY CLEAR.

1219
00:56:04,264 --> 00:56:05,656
YOU MUST DO
THE MATCHMAKING YOURSELF.

1220
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,475
BUT... I BROUGHT HER HERE.

1221
00:56:07,613 --> 00:56:09,166
TO GET A DOG.

1222
00:56:09,304 --> 00:56:10,557
PLUS, THOSE TWO HAVE BEEN
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER

1223
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:11,824
SINCE THEY WERE KIDS.

1224
00:56:11,962 --> 00:56:13,722
LIFE JUST GOT IN THE WAY,
THAT'S ALL.

1225
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,448
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

1226
00:56:15,586 --> 00:56:16,691
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

1227
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:18,209
I ONLY HAVE
ONE DAY LEFT.

1228
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:20,384
I'M SORRY, EVE,
BUT RULES ARE RULES.

1229
00:56:20,522 --> 00:56:22,317
SINCE WHEN DOES LOVE
HAVE RULES?

1230
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:24,053
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOURSELF THE SAME QUESTION.

1231
00:56:24,077 --> 00:56:26,390
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

1232
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:27,678
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WON'T ALLOW HERSELF

1233
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,186
TO GET CLOSE
TO ANYONE,

1234
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:31,233
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN HURT
A FEW TIMES IN THE PAST.

1235
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:32,810
NOW, ISN'T THAT
A RULE?

1236
00:56:32,948 --> 00:56:34,812
NO, THAT'S COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.

1237
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,331
I AM PROTECTING
MYSELF.

1238
00:56:36,469 --> 00:56:38,816
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID.

1239
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:40,369
LOVE ISN'T
FOR SISSIES, EVE.

1240
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:42,026
OH, I HEARD THAT
THE FIRST TIME,

1241
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:43,407
AND THIS IS THE LAST.

1242
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:44,408
THAT'S IT, I QUIT.

1243
00:56:44,546 --> 00:56:45,546
NOW, EVE...

1244
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:47,411
OH, DON'T "NOW, EVE" ME.

1245
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:49,758
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

1246
00:56:49,896 --> 00:56:52,174
I FOUND THOSE COUPLES
AND I PUT THEM TOGETHER,

1247
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:54,694
AND I BOUGHT THEM
DINNERS AND TICKETS,

1248
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:57,939
AND I EVEN GOT SHOTS
FOR THAT DOG.

1249
00:56:58,077 --> 00:57:00,493
I THINK, AFTER ALL THAT,
I DESERVE A LITTLE LOVE.

1250
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:02,599
NO ONE DESERVES LOVE,
EVE.

1251
00:57:02,737 --> 00:57:04,428
IT'S NOT A PRIZE.
IT'S A GIFT.

1252
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,536
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT EITHER ONE.

1253
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:10,538
GOODBYE, VERNON.

1254
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,712
AND IF I NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN,

1255
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,335
WHICH I SINCERELY HOPE
IS THE CASE,

1256
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,889
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.

1257
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:36,460
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MISS LOVETT.

1258
00:57:36,598 --> 00:57:39,290
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

1259
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,300
OH, GET A ROOM.

1260
00:57:57,654 --> 00:57:59,138
GOOD EVENING,
MISS LOVETT.

1261
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,658
- GOOD EVENING, LOUIS.
- YOUR TABLE IS READY.

1262
00:58:01,796 --> 00:58:05,489
AND YOUR CHAMPAGNE
IS ON ICE.

1263
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:07,042
MY CHAMPAGNE?

1264
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:14,774
I DIDN'T ORDER CHAMPAGNE,
LOUIS.

1265
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,535
NO, THE CHAMPAGNE
COMES COMPLIMENTS

1266
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:19,710
OF THE LADY
AT THE BAR.

1267
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,860
WELL, AT LEAST SOMEBODY'S
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

1268
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:40,386
HEY.

1269
00:58:40,524 --> 00:58:42,353
HEY.

1270
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,806
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA BE...

1271
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:48,981
I DON'T WANNA BOTHER YOU.
CAN I GET A TABLE, LOUIS?

1272
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,397
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
JOIN ME.

1273
00:58:51,535 --> 00:58:53,088
- YOU SURE?
- PLEASE.

1274
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:58,887
BESIDES, I CAN'T FINISH
THIS ENTIRE BOTTLE

1275
00:58:59,025 --> 00:59:00,648
OF CHAMPAGNE
BY MYSELF.

1276
00:59:00,786 --> 00:59:02,719
WELL...

1277
00:59:02,857 --> 00:59:04,444
NOT THE KIND OF OFFER
I CAN REFUSE.

1278
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:08,241
YEAH, PRODUCING TELEVISION'S
PRETTY MUCH THE LAST THING

1279
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,659
I EVER THOUGHT
I'D WIND UP DOING.

1280
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:10,795
WHAT DID
YOU WANT TO DO?

1281
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:12,729
PROMISE YOU WON'T LAUGH.

1282
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:14,662
OH, I CAN'T PROMISE
ANYTHING OF THE SORT.

1283
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,838
I, UH, WANT TO BE
A WRITER.

1284
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:22,324
- NOT LAUGHING.
- NO, NOT YET.

1285
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:24,844
A SERIOUS WRITER.
THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL.

1286
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,467
LAUGH ANYTIME NOW.

1287
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,505
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.
WHAT WAS THAT?

1288
00:59:30,643 --> 00:59:32,680
NO TALENT.

1289
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:34,267
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT.

1290
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,442
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE,
BUT NOT ENOUGH.

1291
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,282
AND WHEN I REALIZED
IT WASN'T GOING TO BE GREAT,

1292
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:40,515
I THOUGHT,
"WHY EVEN BOTHER?"

1293
00:59:40,653 --> 00:59:42,217
YOU KNOW? I MEAN,
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CHILDISH.

1294
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:45,347
IT DOESN'T SOUND CHILDISH
AT ALL.

1295
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:46,866
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

1296
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:48,637
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED TO BE A WRITER.

1297
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:53,390
WELL, NOTHING AS GRAND
AS THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL,

1298
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:56,013
BUT I DID MAJOR IN JOURNALISM
IN COLLEGE,

1299
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,188
AND, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT BY NOW

1300
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:00,535
I WOULD HAVE
THIS VERY SERIOUS COLUMN

1301
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:03,607
IN THE TIMES, YOU KNOW,
TACKLING THE IMPORTANT ISSUES

1302
01:00:03,745 --> 01:00:06,886
AND... HELPING PEOPLE.

1303
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,439
I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT WRITING,

1304
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:11,684
BUT ISN'T THAT KIND OF
WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW?

1305
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:13,479
HARDLY.

1306
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:17,725
SOMETIMES I FEEL MORE LIKE
A RINGMASTER AT A CIRCUS.

1307
01:00:17,863 --> 01:00:20,555
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
A VERY GOOD RINGMASTER.

1308
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:23,662
WAS THAT A COMPLIMENT,
MR. DAYTON?

1309
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,491
HEY, YOU'RE CATCHING ON.

1310
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:33,810
IT WAS, YEAH.

1311
01:00:33,948 --> 01:00:35,708
LOOKS LIKE
WE SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

1312
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:39,505
GUESS SO.

1313
01:00:39,643 --> 01:00:41,576
QUIET NIGHT, HUH?

1314
01:00:41,714 --> 01:00:43,820
MM-HMM.

1315
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,065
- RICK...
- EVE...

1316
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:53,036
GO AHEAD.
NO, YOU GO.

1317
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,834
I JUST WANT
TO SAY THAT, UM...

1318
01:00:57,972 --> 01:01:00,664
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL
TONIGHT.

1319
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:02,002
COME... YOU'VE SEEN
THIS DRESS.

1320
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,771
I WORE IT
ON THE SHOW.

1321
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:04,772
I DON'T MEAN
THE DRESS.

1322
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,774
I MEAN YOU.

1323
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:09,397
THERE'S...
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

1324
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:12,952
YOU'RE, UM... GLOWING
OR SOMETHING.

1325
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,680
UM... MAYBE
IT'S THE LIGHTING.

1326
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:18,682
EVE, IT'S NOT
THE LIGHTING.

1327
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,926
THAT WAS DEFINITELY
A COMPLIMENT.

1328
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:23,549
YES, IT WAS.

1329
01:01:23,687 --> 01:01:25,793
OKAY.
IT WAS.

1330
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:27,898
WELL...

1331
01:01:29,658 --> 01:01:31,522
THANK YOU.

1332
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,319
- IT'S A...
- UH...

1333
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:03,485
I AM SO SORRY.

1334
01:02:03,623 --> 01:02:05,453
MY FAULT.

1335
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:06,454
- I...
- MY... MY...

1336
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:07,973
NO, I SHOULDN'T HAVE...

1337
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:09,911
NO, NO, DON'T... DON'T...
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

1338
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:13,461
THAT WAS, UM...
REALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

1339
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,599
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

1340
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:16,464
UM, YEAH.

1341
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:18,604
UM... OKAY.

1342
01:02:18,742 --> 01:02:21,227
SO I'M GONNA GO.

1343
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:22,573
ME TOO.

1344
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,611
UH, GOODNIGHT.

1345
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:28,579
GOODNIGHT.

1346
01:02:30,754 --> 01:02:32,307
GOODNIGHT.

1347
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,045
GOODNIGHT.

1348
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:56,193
GOOD MORNING, EVE.

1349
01:02:56,331 --> 01:02:57,436
MORNING.

1350
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:59,541
BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?
YEAH, SURE.

1351
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,347
HARVEY AND I HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME LAST NIGHT.

1352
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:02,727
WE SPENT THE WHOLE EVENING
CATCHING UP,

1353
01:03:02,751 --> 01:03:03,787
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

1354
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:05,513
GREAT.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

1355
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:07,318
YOU AND MR. DAYTON SEEMED
TO BE ENJOYING YOURSELVES.

1356
01:03:07,342 --> 01:03:08,447
WHAT?

1357
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:09,838
IT WAS LIKE THERE
WAS NOBODY ELSE

1358
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:10,863
IN THE WHOLE RESTAURANT.

1359
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:12,140
IT WAS A BUSINESS DINNER.

1360
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:13,901
DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY
TO ME.

1361
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:17,249
I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TO YOU.

1362
01:03:17,387 --> 01:03:19,734
IT WAS JUST BUSINESS.
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

1363
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:23,186
BUSINESS.

1364
01:03:26,258 --> 01:03:28,018
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

1365
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:02,201
- GOOD MORNING, EVE.
- MORNING, MISS LOVETT.

1366
01:04:02,225 --> 01:04:03,512
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY MAIL TO DELIVER?

1367
01:04:03,536 --> 01:04:05,676
AND I WILL
TALK TO YOU LATER.

1368
01:04:09,404 --> 01:04:10,554
SO I WILL GET YOUR TEA
AND, UH...

1369
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:11,959
ALL RIGHT, STOP...

1370
01:04:12,097 --> 01:04:13,615
BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING ELSE,

1371
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:15,790
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING
PERFECTLY CLEAR

1372
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:18,068
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

1373
01:04:18,206 --> 01:04:19,804
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO SPREAD
THIS INFORMATION AROUND.

1374
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:22,970
NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEARD
FROM JANICE OR ANYONE ELSE,

1375
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:25,282
MR. DAYTON AND I
ARE CO-WORKERS.

1376
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,319
WE WERE HAVING
A CO-WORKING DINNER,

1377
01:04:27,457 --> 01:04:29,597
DURING WHICH TIME,
WE CO-WORKED.

1378
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:30,598
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

1379
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:31,771
YEAH.

1380
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,290
GOOD.

1381
01:04:33,428 --> 01:04:34,468
WHAT WERE
YOU GOING TO SAY?

1382
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:35,637
YOU HAVE A GUEST.

1383
01:04:35,775 --> 01:04:38,986
THANK YOU.

1384
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:41,298
EXCUSE ME,
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

1385
01:04:41,436 --> 01:04:42,990
THIS WAS MY OFFICE.

1386
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:44,888
THERE SHE IS.

1387
01:04:45,026 --> 01:04:47,339
HEY, HI.

1388
01:04:47,477 --> 01:04:49,444
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1389
01:04:49,582 --> 01:04:52,309
OH, A PATIENT OF MINE
IS STARRING

1390
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:54,070
IN A BIG ACTION MOVIE
OUT HERE,

1391
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:55,461
AND HE HAD AN EMOTIONAL MELTDOWN
ON SET LAST NIGHT.

1392
01:04:55,485 --> 01:04:56,658
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

1393
01:04:56,796 --> 01:04:57,916
WELL, IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT,

1394
01:04:58,039 --> 01:04:59,359
HE WOULDN'T BE AN ACTOR,
WOULD HE?

1395
01:05:01,387 --> 01:05:03,010
RICK HAS BEEN
KEEPING ME COMPANY,

1396
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:04,597
TELLING ME
ALL ABOUT YOUR SHOW.

1397
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:05,920
HE SAYS YOU'RE DOING IT
LIVE TODAY.

1398
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,290
THAT'S SO EXCITING.

1399
01:05:07,428 --> 01:05:09,430
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE
NERVE-RACKING TOO.

1400
01:05:09,568 --> 01:05:10,959
AND WE ARE READY
TO REHEARSE THE SKETCH,

1401
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:12,951
SO AFTER
YOU GUYS CATCH UP,

1402
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:14,100
I NEED YOU TO GO
TO WARDROBE,

1403
01:05:14,124 --> 01:05:15,470
GET THE HARNESS ON,

1404
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:16,965
AND RUN THROUGH IT
A COUPLE TIMES, OKAY?

1405
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:18,370
OKAY.
BE RIGHT THERE.

1406
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:20,337
OKAY. IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU, NANCY.

1407
01:05:20,475 --> 01:05:21,960
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER TOLD ME

1408
01:05:22,098 --> 01:05:23,109
YOU HAD SUCH
BEAUTIFUL FRIENDS IN NEW YORK.

1409
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:24,928
OH, I LIKE THIS ONE.

1410
01:05:25,066 --> 01:05:26,343
KEEP TALKING.

1411
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:27,665
YOU KNOW WHAT, NANCY,
IF YOU WANT,

1412
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:28,863
YOU CAN JOIN EVE,
COME DOWN,

1413
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:30,382
AND WATCH THE REHEARSALS.

1414
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,211
YOU SURE
THAT'D BE OKAY?

1415
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:33,602
OF COURSE.
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

1416
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:35,007
ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU SOON.

1417
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:38,804
SO... THAT'S
THE FAMOUS RICK

1418
01:05:38,942 --> 01:05:40,702
YOU'RE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT.

1419
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,360
I AM NOT
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HIM.

1420
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:44,858
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD
AROUND HERE,

1421
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:45,983
YOU TWO
ARE A REAL ITEM.

1422
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:49,056
THAT IS NOT TRUE
AT ALL.

1423
01:05:49,194 --> 01:05:51,403
THAT IS A RUMOR
SOMEBODY STARTED,

1424
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:53,141
AND IT'S GOING TO STOP
RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE.

1425
01:05:53,232 --> 01:05:54,958
SO THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON BETWEEN YOU?

1426
01:05:55,096 --> 01:05:57,374
NOTHING.
WE WORK TOGETHER.

1427
01:05:57,512 --> 01:05:58,893
ALL THE MORE CONVENIENT.

1428
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,415
NANCY, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN EACH OTHER.

1429
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:05,417
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?
- POSITIVE.

1430
01:06:05,555 --> 01:06:07,729
SO YOU HAVEN'T EVER
MADE A MOVE ON HIM.

1431
01:06:07,867 --> 01:06:08,868
NEVER.
NOT ONCE.

1432
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,698
BUT COME ON,
HE'S HOT.

1433
01:06:10,836 --> 01:06:12,424
"HOT"?

1434
01:06:12,562 --> 01:06:15,323
I GUESS HE'S...

1435
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:17,084
GOOD-LOOKING,
IN HIS WAY.

1436
01:06:17,222 --> 01:06:19,372
I WOULDN'T MIND HIM LOOKING
MY WAY WHILE HE WAS AT IT.

1437
01:06:19,396 --> 01:06:21,985
SAME OLD NANCY.

1438
01:06:22,123 --> 01:06:23,443
HEY, WHEN YOU SEE
WHAT YOU WANT,

1439
01:06:23,504 --> 01:06:25,402
YOU HAVE
TO GO FOR IT, RIGHT?

1440
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,403
RIGHT.

1441
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:28,371
HMM.

1442
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:33,110
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS A HORRIBLE IDEA.

1443
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:36,586
IT'S NEVER
GOING TO WORK.

1444
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:40,210
LOOKING GOOD, RICK.

1445
01:06:43,386 --> 01:06:45,215
- WE SET, GUYS?
- HEY.

1446
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:46,423
- HEY.
- HEY.

1447
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:49,288
YOU ALL RIGHT?

1448
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:51,026
I'M HOT AND
THIS THING IS REALLY TIGHT.

1449
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:54,052
I... I MEANT
ABOUT US.

1450
01:06:56,157 --> 01:07:00,058
UM, RICK...
ABOUT LAST NIGHT...

1451
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:02,516
YEAH, WE, UH... NEVER SHOULD
HAVE HAD THAT MUCH CHAMPAGNE.

1452
01:07:02,612 --> 01:07:05,304
NO, IT WAS
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL OF US.

1453
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,893
DEFINITELY.
YEAH.

1454
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:09,515
OKAY, GOOD.

1455
01:07:09,653 --> 01:07:11,493
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT
WE GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY.

1456
01:07:11,552 --> 01:07:15,038
YEAH, ME TOO.
THAT'S, UM...

1457
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:16,453
SO YOU'RE...
YEAH.

1458
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:18,766
WELL, CHECK THE...
JUST THAT-YEAH.

1459
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:21,424
SO, UH...
WHAT'S...

1460
01:07:21,562 --> 01:07:24,047
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
YOUR FRIEND NANCY THERE?

1461
01:07:24,185 --> 01:07:26,291
UH, W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1462
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:28,327
WELL, IS SHE SINGLE
OR...?

1463
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:30,950
UH... YEAH.
SHE'S... SHE'S SINGLE.

1464
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,469
WHY DO YOU ASK?

1465
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:34,920
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.
I MEAN...

1466
01:07:35,058 --> 01:07:36,335
SHE SEEMS NICE.

1467
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,406
YEAH,
SHE'S REALLY NICE.

1468
01:07:38,544 --> 01:07:40,167
SHE'S ONE OF
MY BEST FRIENDS.

1469
01:07:40,305 --> 01:07:42,962
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
UNDER THAT GOOD GIRL FACADE,

1470
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,423
THAT ONE OVER THERE,
SHE GOT ME IN A LOT OF TROUBLE

1471
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:46,656
WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER.

1472
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:49,624
LOOKING AT HER,
I CAN BELIEVE THAT.

1473
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:51,523
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

1474
01:07:51,661 --> 01:07:54,733
WELL, SHE'S JUST GOT
THAT... WICKED GLINT IN HER EYE.

1475
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,804
WHAT, AND I DON'T?

1476
01:07:56,942 --> 01:08:00,359
NO. I... I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

1477
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:02,982
YOU'RE... YOU'RE JUST MORE...
PRACTICAL.

1478
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,363
YOU MEAN BORING.

1479
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:05,847
NO, THAT...

1480
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:07,470
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1481
01:08:07,608 --> 01:08:08,619
LET'S JUST PRETEND
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

1482
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:10,162
OKAY?
OOKAY.

1483
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,740
- TAKE HER AWAY, GUYS.
- WAIT, RICK...

1484
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:15,478
OH, THERE SHE GOES.

1485
01:08:15,616 --> 01:08:17,928
IS IT SUPPOSED
TO DO THIS?

1486
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:27,317
OKAY, UH,
I THINK THAT'S...

1487
01:08:27,455 --> 01:08:29,388
THAT'S GOOD.

1488
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,908
SO, WHAT DOES
A PRODUCER DO ANYWAY?

1489
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:34,359
MOSTLY KEEP PEOPLE
LIKE EVE IN LINE.

1490
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:36,395
THAT MUST BE
A FULL-TIME JOB.

1491
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:38,328
YEAH, AND
THE PAY'S LOUSY TOO.

1492
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:40,399
HELLO?

1493
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,332
REMEMBER ME
UP HERE?

1494
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,404
IT'S KIND OF SCARY.

1495
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:47,475
PEOPLE,
WHEN WE GO TO AIR,

1496
01:08:47,613 --> 01:08:49,522
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
ONE CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT,

1497
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,341
SO LET'S ALL
REMEMBER THE CUE.

1498
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:53,412
YOU READY?

1499
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:56,243
IN THREE, TWO,

1500
01:08:56,381 --> 01:08:58,900
ONE...
AAH! WHOA! OH!

1501
01:09:00,316 --> 01:09:01,455
HEY.

1502
01:09:01,593 --> 01:09:03,353
RICK?
WHAT-WHAT'S WRONG?

1503
01:09:03,491 --> 01:09:04,872
HEY, RICK!

1504
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,426
- IT'S, UH... IT'S JAMMED.
- OH, YOU THINK?

1505
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,014
GUYS, GET HER DOWN.

1506
01:09:09,152 --> 01:09:12,362
HEY, CAN YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS PLEASE?

1507
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,261
WHOSE IDEA
WAS THIS ANYWAY?

1508
01:09:17,298 --> 01:09:19,749
LISTEN!

1509
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:21,268
I'M A TALK SHOW HOST,
NOT A PINATA.

1510
01:09:26,756 --> 01:09:28,043
YOU'RE GETTING A KICK
OUT OF THIS?

1511
01:09:28,067 --> 01:09:30,415
TRINA!
HELP ME!

1512
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:32,658
GLAD YOU GUYS THINK
THIS IS FUNNY.

1513
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:01,618
THAT'S A LITTLE TOO FAST.

1514
01:10:01,756 --> 01:10:03,482
YEAH?

1515
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,184
I'M READY FOR MY CLOSE-UP?
YOU'RE READY FOR PRIME TIME.

1516
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:08,038
NO.
WHAT DOES THIS THING DO?

1517
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:13,734
VERNON?

1518
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:19,429
VERNON.

1519
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:22,052
ARE YOU IN HERE?

1520
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:24,331
VERNON, COME ON.

1521
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:25,584
I KNOW THAT I SAID
THAT I QUIT,

1522
01:10:25,608 --> 01:10:27,506
BUT I NEED ANOTHER CHANCE,

1523
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:29,508
'CAUSE I THINK
I FIGURED IT OUT.

1524
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:30,830
I THINK I KNOW
WHO THE COUPLE IS.

1525
01:10:30,854 --> 01:10:34,444
VERNON!

1526
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:35,859
COME ON.

1527
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:37,557
YOU SAID IT WAS
NEVER TOO LATE FOR LOVE.

1528
01:10:37,585 --> 01:10:39,587
HOW 'BOUT IT?

1529
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:45,524
VERNON?

1530
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:48,009
NEVER MIND.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1531
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,460
I DON'T NEED YOU.
I'M GONNA DO THIS MYSELF.

1532
01:11:08,616 --> 01:11:10,411
GOT IT.

1533
01:11:12,586 --> 01:11:13,725
HEY, HEY, RICK.

1534
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:15,382
- THAT'S ALL?
- WE'RE GOOD.

1535
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,487
- GOT A MINUTE?
- UH, YEAH.

1536
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,524
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE IN MAKEUP.

1537
01:11:19,662 --> 01:11:20,870
I'M ON MY WAY.

1538
01:11:21,008 --> 01:11:23,562
HAVE YOU SEEN NANCY
ANYWHERE AROUND?

1539
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,919
SHE WENT TO THE COMMISSARY
FOR COFFEE.

1540
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:25,943
SHE'LL BE BACK
IN A WHILE.

1541
01:11:25,978 --> 01:11:27,704
OH, OKAY.

1542
01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:29,706
SHE LIKES YOU.
I CAN TELL.

1543
01:11:29,844 --> 01:11:32,571
I LIKE HER TOO.
SHE'S NICE.

1544
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,749
I WAS THINKING THAT,
MAYBE TONIGHT AFTER THE SHOW,

1545
01:11:34,815 --> 01:11:35,988
YOU'D WANT TO GO OUT.

1546
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,405
THE THREE OF US?
THAT'S OKAY.

1547
01:11:38,543 --> 01:11:39,743
YOU GUYS NEED TIME
TO CATCH UP.

1548
01:11:39,785 --> 01:11:41,408
OH, I WASN'T
GOING TO GO.

1549
01:11:41,546 --> 01:11:42,892
WHAT?

1550
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,239
YEAH, I JUST... THOUGHT
MAYBE THE TWO OF YOU

1551
01:11:45,377 --> 01:11:47,097
MIGHT WANT TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

1552
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:49,485
WHAT?

1553
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:54,352
ARE YOU TRYING TO HAND ME OFF
TO YOUR FRIEND?

1554
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:56,319
WH... NO, NOT EXACTLY.

1555
01:11:56,457 --> 01:11:58,539
IT'S JUST, YOU SEEMED
LIKE YOU WERE INTERESTED IN HER.

1556
01:11:58,563 --> 01:12:00,461
IN HER?

1557
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,361
WHAT ABOUT US?

1558
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:04,879
"US"?

1559
01:12:05,017 --> 01:12:07,157
YEAH, US.
YOU AND ME.

1560
01:12:08,883 --> 01:12:11,092
WELL, YOU AND NANCY
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON...

1561
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:12,749
EVE...

1562
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:15,511
THE ONLY THING
WE HAVE IN COMMON

1563
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:18,859
IS THAT
WE BOTH LOVE YOU.

1564
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:23,622
I THOUGHT
YOU FELT IT TOO...

1565
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,556
WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON BETWEEN US.

1566
01:12:26,694 --> 01:12:28,879
I THOUGHT THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING TO GO ON HERE.

1567
01:12:28,903 --> 01:12:30,664
WELL, CLEARLY YOU DON'T.

1568
01:12:30,802 --> 01:12:32,504
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING
TO SET ME UP WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

1569
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:33,888
NO, NO, NO,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1570
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:37,533
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU FIND LOVE.

1571
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:40,398
- HERE.
- WHAT'S THIS FOR?

1572
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:41,892
THAT'S FOR THE NEXT PERSON
YOU HIRE TO PRODUCE YOUR SHOW.

1573
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:44,471
WHAT?

1574
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:47,128
THIS CAN'T WORK, EVE,
NOT NOW.

1575
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:49,303
RICK,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

1576
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:51,650
WE GO ON THE AIR LIVE
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

1577
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:53,583
NOT "WE."
YOU.

1578
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:57,484
I QUIT.

1579
01:12:57,622 --> 01:12:59,313
HAVE A GOOD SHOW.

1580
01:13:08,598 --> 01:13:10,393
OH, EVE!

1581
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:11,601
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

1582
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:13,016
- HEY.
- HEY.

1583
01:13:13,154 --> 01:13:14,546
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
TO BREAK A LEG,

1584
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:15,985
BUT THEN I GOT
TO THINKING

1585
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:17,963
MAYBE THAT WASN'T SUCH
A GOOD THING TO SAY AFTER ALL.

1586
01:13:17,987 --> 01:13:20,438
THANKS...
I THINK.

1587
01:13:20,576 --> 01:13:21,749
I WOULDN'T WORRY
TOO MUCH.

1588
01:13:21,887 --> 01:13:23,579
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS
WITH RICK.

1589
01:13:23,717 --> 01:13:25,581
HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT YOU.

1590
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:28,169
- YEAH?
- ABSOLUTELY.

1591
01:13:28,307 --> 01:13:30,033
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
INTERESTED IN HIM,

1592
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:34,762
SO I USED MY BEST HAIR TOSSES
AND MY BIGGEST SMILES,

1593
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,488
AND ALL HE COULD DO
WAS TALK ABOUT YOU.

1594
01:13:36,626 --> 01:13:39,180
- ME?
- MM-HMM.

1595
01:13:39,318 --> 01:13:41,459
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, BUT...

1596
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:44,531
HE'S A KEEPER.

1597
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:47,706
ANYWAY...
GOOD LUCK.

1598
01:13:47,844 --> 01:13:49,639
I WILL BE WATCHING YOU.

1599
01:13:55,403 --> 01:13:58,199

- RICK QUIT.

YOU'RE TAKING IT SO CALMLY.

01:19:58,525 --> 01:20:00,182
NOW YOU HAVE
TO DO IT ON TV?

1719
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,357
NO, I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

1720
01:20:06,153 --> 01:20:09,260
I HAVE BEEN RUNNING
AROUND HERE,

1721
01:20:09,398 --> 01:20:12,228
TRYING TO FIND
THE PERFECT COUPLE,

1722
01:20:12,366 --> 01:20:14,127
AND WE'VE BEEN RIGHT HERE
ALL ALONG.

1723
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:21,928
WHAT DO YOU WANT, EVE?

1724
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:23,653
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WANT.

1725
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,866
I WANT YOU...

1726
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:31,213
TO BE MY VALENTINE.

1727
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:37,564
THAT'S, UH...
THAT'S KIND OF CORNY.

1728
01:20:39,221 --> 01:20:40,878
LITTLE CHEESY?

1729
01:20:41,016 --> 01:20:42,707
VERY OLD-FASHIONED, YEAH.

1730
01:20:42,845 --> 01:20:45,952
"OLD-FASHIONED"?

1731
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:47,677
THAT'S WHY
THE PEOPLE LOVE IT.

1732
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,685
AND THAT'S WHY
I LOVE YOU.

1733
01:20:58,205 --> 01:20:59,068
IS THAT A COMPLIMENT?

1734
01:20:59,206 --> 01:21:01,381
I WOULD SAY SO.

1735
01:21:47,496 --> 01:21:49,360
THE FIRST OVERNIGHT RATINGS
JUST CAME IN.

1736
01:21:49,498 --> 01:21:51,741
AND WE BEAT
THE SINGING JUDGE...

1737
01:21:51,879 --> 01:21:53,122
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

1738
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,779
OUR NUMBERS
ARE THROUGH THE ROOF!

1739
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:56,539
HEY!

1740
01:22:00,509 --> 01:22:01,993
TO OUR HOST.

1741
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:04,133
- TO OUR PRODUCER
- AH.

1742
01:22:07,481 --> 01:22:09,932
WOW, WHERE'D THOSE
COME FROM?

1743
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:11,761
I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA.

1744
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:14,661
LOOK AT THESE.

1745
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:16,974
"TO EVE AND RICK,

1746
01:22:17,112 --> 01:22:18,354
"HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.

1747
01:22:18,492 --> 01:22:21,495
FROM ALL OF US
AT THE HEAD OFFICE"?

1748
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:26,293
LONG STORY.

1749
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:29,055
WELL, YOU CAN TELL IT TO ME
ON THE HONEYMOON.

1750
01:22:30,953 --> 01:22:33,783
MMM, THOSE CHOCOLATES.

1751
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:39,065
HI, HONEY.

1752
01:22:39,203 --> 01:22:41,964
YUP, JUST
ON MY WAY HOME.

1753
01:22:42,102 --> 01:22:43,142
I HAD TO WORK
LATE TONIGHT.

1754
01:22:43,172 --> 01:22:45,347
WHEW, TOUGH CASE.

1755
01:22:45,485 --> 01:22:48,212
BUT WE FINALLY MADE IT
TO HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER

1756
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,799
JUST IN TIME.

1757
01:22:49,937 --> 01:22:51,398
YES, OF COURSE I PICKED UP
THE FLOWERS AND CAKE

1758
01:22:51,422 --> 01:22:53,389
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED.

1759
01:22:53,527 --> 01:22:55,357
YES, I KNOW
WHAT DAY IT IS.

1760
01:22:55,495 --> 01:22:56,944
I'M CUPID,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

1761
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:57,876
GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT
OF CREDIT HERE.

1762
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,395
COME ON, HONEY.
