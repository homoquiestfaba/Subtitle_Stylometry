1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Be right back.

2
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The angels...

3
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
...not half so happy in heaven,

4
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
went envying her and me.

5
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That was the reason as all men
know in this kingdom by the sea.

6
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,699
That the wind came out of
the cloud by night,

7
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
chilling...

8
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and killing...

9
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
...my Annabel Lee.

10
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
What?

11
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,780
Wrong answer!

12
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The White Man versus the Indians.

13
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's what we all learned in
school.

14
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,980
But that's not entirely
accurate.

15
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It was actually the
White Man versus the Indians...

16
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
versus the Indians.

17
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You see, when the Europeans
first came to the New Worid,

18
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the Indians viewed them
as just another tribe.

19
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
One to trade with, fight with,

20
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
or ally with

21
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
...against other Indians.

22
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But the Europeans brought
with them something

23
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
that the Indians had
never seen before...

24
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
...and had no defense against.

25
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I'm not talking about guns and
disease and facial hair...

26
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
though that was true, too.

27
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
No,
I'm talking about GREED.

28
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And soon, the Indian tribes
were being backstabbed

29
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and treaties were being broken,

30
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and whole peoples were
being slaughtered

31
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and moved onto reservations...

32
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
...and that was completely barren

33
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and worthless.

34
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And that was supposed to be the
end of the story.

35
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Except for the fact
that the Europeans forgot that

36
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
greed is contagious.

37
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And the Indian tribes,
along with Smallpox

38
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and Whooping Cough,
had caught it...

39
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and learned to wield it against
their conquerors.

40
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wichch is where I come in

41
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Victim number 299 million

42
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
458 thousand,

43
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,180
327

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There I am now.

45
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Not a bad looking guy.

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Ohhh!

47
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,459
Maybe that's not the best
place to start.

48
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,500
There we go. Much better.

49
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So there I was.

50
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
At an Indian Gaming Casino.
Just passing through.

51
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was like an old West gun fighter
coming into town,

52
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,879
looking to right
past wrongs and make a fortune.

53
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Except, of course..

54
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,540
I didn't have a gun or know
the first thing about fighting.

55
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,920
So I played the slots instead...

56
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
before realising I needed to
try my luck elsewhere.

57
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Name, address, phone number.

58
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What do you want
my social too?

59
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Sign here.

60
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,839
Good luck sir.

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There Was
an Elvis impersonation contest...

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
...usually only a Vegas thing.

63
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So on a whim,

64
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I joined.

65
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Talk like an ángel,

66
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,899
but I got wise.

67
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your the Devil in Disguise.

68
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh yes you are

69
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Did okay.

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not enough to win or
anything, but

71
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
okay enough to grab
the attention of

72
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
a beautiful lady at the bar.

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
With your kisses

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You cheated and you schemed.

75
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
John Smith lied to
Chief Powhatan

76
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
about why he had come to the
New Worid in the first place...

77
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that's why Pocahontas
had to save him.

78
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ah ah, she was in love.

79
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
She was eleven.

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm not eleven.

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No, your ah...

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
...you're not.

83
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mmm.
Buy me another drink?

84
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Mmm!

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
She seemed reelly interested in me

86
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and I was pretty sure I knew
where this was going.

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Unfortunately...

88
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
...life doesn't always
go the way you think it will.

89
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
As it turns out,

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
she was more
interested in what was in my wallet...

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It was nice meeting you.

92
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Than what was in my pants

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Which is so ironic,

94
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,820
considering I don't keep
my money in my wallet.

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Thank you!

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So instead of a night of crazy
wild sex,

97
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I ended up playing poker

98
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
With a bunch of the Elvises
from the contest.

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And not that Texas
Hold Em bullshit

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you see on TV where everyone
now thinks they're an expert.

101
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No no, I'm talking about

102
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
good old fashioned

103
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,340
backroom, cigar smokin'
five card draw.

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,919
Oh, you're going
down this time.

105
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,080
I like to go down.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,779
I bet you do.

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,340
But I' m more worried
about the Midget.

108
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's not Midget, asshole.

109
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,259
It's "Little Person".

110
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, that's much better.

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Midget is offensive...
but little person is okay?

112
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Who decides these things?

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Screw you, bitch.

114
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Are you in or not huh?

115
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well...

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Last week my girlfriend of three
years

117
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
decided playing doctor with
her doctor,

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
kicked me out of the house
and stole my dog.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, that is just rude.

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
She said, "history would be
written without me."

121
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's that mean?

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Have no idea,
so I just got in my car,

123
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
came down here,

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
got dissed by a girl at the bar,
lost at slots,

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and had my wallet stolen.

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So hell yes boys, I am in.

127
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Read 'em and weep.
Aces and sixes.

128
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Ha! Unlucky in love,

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
unlucky in cards, bitch.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Three deuces.

131
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Little person, little hand.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Read 'em and weep boys.
Straight to the ten.

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

134
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't think so.

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Hail to the Queen! Baby.

136
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hell, well this is a game of Elvises.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,919
We're going to hail to the King!

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
First you win the contest,

139
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
now you're taking all our money.

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know something we don't?

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah. How to pay cards.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I thought was strictly a Vegas thing,
what's the deal here?

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah well the Chief,
he has a thing for Mr. Presley.

144
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,679
The Chief? Who is the Chief?

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The Chief, head of the tribe,
owner of the casino.

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He worships the King almost
as much as he does

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,919
his ancient Apache Warrior Mask.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is our hotel!

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We're all kings here.

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We're VIP's.

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Access to everything.

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You didn't stand a chance in that contest.

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thanks very much.

154
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So are we gonna play
some more cards,

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or is Mr. Miyagi still mad?

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He might...

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,740
...chop, chop our heads. Hoi!

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, I get it I get it.
'Cause I'm Asian,

159
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I must be Japanese,

160
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I must do karate.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know, that's really clever.
You got another one.

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, your driving,
it sucks.

163
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You know, even though flying monkeys
scare the hell out of me,

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don' t give you a hard time
about the Wizard of Oz, do I?

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Woo.

166
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And if Whitey the Clan Member here
wants to bomb abortion clinics,

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't try to stop him.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I mean, getting molested by a priest
can really screw a kid up.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, what about you?

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If I bend over, are you gonna fantasize
about my ass?

171
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You going to "Queer Eye"
my apartment?

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I wouldn't have a problem
if you did

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
'cause that' s the
kinda guy I am.

174
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What are you looking at?

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you some kind of
generic European hybrid?

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Look man my ah...

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
My wallet and ID
got stolen.

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's my story.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And now we took your money.

180
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's just terrible.

181
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I now had no girl

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No ID and no money.

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But overall,

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,179
The Elvises seemed to be a pretty
good bunch of guys.

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,340
But, of course, looks can be
deceiving.

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,539
Ah, crap.

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Guys! Guys! Take it easy!

188
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Come on guys!
I know I do a really bad Elvis but

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
this is a little extreme huh?

190
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And here we are again.

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,799
Well, no
use stalling anymore.

192
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey wait! Wait I though...

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Native Americans are supposed
to be peace-loving, philosophy spouting,

194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,259
protectors of nature?

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,679
That's a blatant stereotype.

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The Apaches...

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
...are the most fearsome
warriors...

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
...the worid has ever seen.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,960
Wait! Ash! Wait!

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where's the mask?

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,600
What mask?

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,820
The ancient Apache
Warrior Mask that you stole.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,440
I didn't steal anything.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Who is he?

205
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He doesn't
have any ID on him.

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
My ID was stolen last night.
My wallet...

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
my ID everything.
You should really do something

208
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
about the security in this place.
You got these two... Allright! Allright!

209
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Smith. John Smith.
Don't hit me again!

210
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
John Smith.

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well Mr. Smith,

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,899
an Elvis impersonator just stole the
Chief's sacred warrior mask.

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You guys saw my performance

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm the worst Elvis impersonator
that ever lived.

215
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,399
Where would I be hiding it?
In my pants?

216
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The White Man
has stolen this mask before.

217
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And the Tribe...

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,700
...has suffered many hardships
because of it.

219
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,340
It took almost a century to recover it.

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Before it was learned that the
white man had once again

221
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,519
broken his word and
invaded sacred ground.

222
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But this time

223
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,460
...the Chief and his men
were victorious.

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And only then...

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,940
...did glory and prosperity return
to our people.

226
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's a really great
story and ahh...

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
...I know how it feels to
loose something valuable.

228
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I sympathize there,

229
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I give you guys all my support
in the worid in finding it now

230
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
if you just uncuff me

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and get me out of here

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
you can go look for it!

233
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,200
One million dollars.

234
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's the price.

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I want that mask back here...

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
...by tomorrow night.

237
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Words going to get out.

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Call the Indian.

239
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Who's the Indian?

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You hear that?
Agh

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,859
Your friends are in for it now.

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Looks like we're hunting Elvises.

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It seem as though the
contest winner...

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
...wrote down his
address on his entry form.

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Who would be that stupid?

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,680
Name, address, phone number.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,599
Sign here.

248
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All right, I'll stop
talking.

249
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What about him?

250
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,980
Well, he's an Elvis impersonator.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's only one way
to be safe.

252
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Kill him.

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hey!

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And besides.

255
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Native Americans can do without
another John Smith.

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Come on, no! No! No!
Take it easy!

257
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Guys! Guys! Come on!

258
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Really, you don't have
to do this!

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm nothing, I'm nobody!
Ask my exgirlfriend.

260
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's why we can do this.

261
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You think the Rancher
is responsible?

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He's always responsible.

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,079
Who's the Rancher?

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The guy that hired you
to steal the mask.

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey, nobody hired
me remember?

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The guy who hired the guy...

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
who stole the mask.

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In the past when the Government
wanted to screw the Tribe.

269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It was always over money!

270
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And almost always

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that money went into
the Ranchers pocket.

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And he hates Native Americans.

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But you guys are so friendly!

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh oh, God!

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,740
Hey, hey look I could scream.

276
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What's college boy going to do?

277
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,740
Crush beer cans on our heads?

278
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Which one's yours?

279
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Agh...

280
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,359
Duh...

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That one.

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That piece of crap?

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Buy American. Come on,
you guys are Native American,

284
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,500
I thought you'd be proud.

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What are you doing?

286
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm copying down this Elvis
address just in case.

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh come on, you think the guy
who stole the mask put his

288
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
real address down on
an entry form?

289
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Get in!

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Where?

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,539
The tunk!

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
[SNAKE RATTLES}

293
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You're in tune...

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
...with K.Z.R.E...

295
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
where we play you
the best of yesterday...

296
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,779
...and today.

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I awoke not knowing where I was

298
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,859
Which is probably
a good thing.

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,299
Yeah!

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Agh!

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,480
Come on!

302
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,299
Okay!

303
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,480
Oh Shit!

304
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
Oh... What?!

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,359
Jesus!

306
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,819
Well looks like Elvis gets
to live another day.

307
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You really think the guy who
stole the mask wrote his...

308
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,279
...real address down
on an entry form.

309
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,660
Let's hope.

310
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Your attention please.

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This is an announcement
for Train 735...

312
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
...to San Antonio,
Baton Rouge and Tacoma

313
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This train has been delayed for
approximately one hour.

314
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Please remain in the station.

315
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,940
for further notices.
All passengers will board...

316
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Once upon a midnight dreary...

317
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,920
while I pondered weak and weary.

318
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
There came a tapping,

319
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
gently rapping on my chamber door.

320
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Little lady...

321
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
you better get the hell outta here...

322
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,220
before I pull out the big
gun on you.

323
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Baby, your gun doesn't work on me.

324
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now, where...

325
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,900
...is the mask?

326
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,960
I don't have it.

327
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,779
Wrong answer!

328
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Hmm.

329
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,440
He is telling the truth.

330
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,480
Oh well.

331
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
All right Elvis.

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,579
Let's see if this is
where you really live.

333
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,079
I'm ready for you.

334
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,359
Hello?

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,180
Oh.

336
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You really did put your address
down on the entry form.

337
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,180
You certainly Won't be winning
any thieving contests.

338
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
None of you will be.

339
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
If I were an ancient
Apache Warrior mask,

340
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
where would I be
hiding?

341
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,539
I know...

342
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,779
...the couch!

343
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,180
Uh!

344
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Hello?

345
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Is anybody home?

346
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Who are you?

347
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm the girl next door.

348
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Of course you are.

349
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Can I come in?

350
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No. No. Go away.

351
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's not very
neighbourly of you.

352
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's because I'm not
your neighbour.

353
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You know, I've never
been in here before.

354
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, neat lamp.

355
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Ha.

356
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Come on, cute girl comes
in here and wants to make

357
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
small talk with you and
you tell her to leave?

358
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What are you gay or something?

359
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No, I'm not gay.

360
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's okay if you are.
It's cool.

361
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm old enough to be
your fath...

362
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
...your really cool uncle.

363
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, you're right.

364
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You could be my father.

365
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Could have been an
accident, you know.

366
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Unplanned, high school,
maybe after prom.

367
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What?

368
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
What are you even
doing here anyway?

369
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Oh, sugar.

370
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I need a cup.
Do you have any?

371
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Seriously?

372
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No... it's not the 50's.

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Hell, maybe you are too
old for me.

374
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
See you around Uncle.

375
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,759
Hey if you need anything,
I'm right next door.

376
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Give me the mask.

377
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,960
I don't have it!

378
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Give me the mask...

379
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
...or I kill your
next door neighbour.

380
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
She's not my neighbour,
I don't even live here.

381
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Agh!

382
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That hurt!

383
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Ugh!

384
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So that's how it feels.

385
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Nice punch.

386
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,599
Nice bite.

387
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,859
I'm only going to ask
you once.

388
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Where is the
mask?

389
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Who are you?

390
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,900
I'm the Cowboy.

391
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,019
That was obvious.

392
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And I can shoot the whiskers

393
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
off your chin from 50 yards.

394
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That'd be pretty weird.

395
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well don't you think
the cop behind you

396
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,339
might have something to
say about that?

397
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Look behind you?

398
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I can't believe he
actually fell for it!

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Which one is your car?

400
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't have a car!

401
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
What do you mean you
don't have a car?

402
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't know.
How do you get around?

403
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Thankfully I have a
cool Uncle.

404
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
How did you get here?
I walked!

405
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You walked?
Yeah.

406
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
From where?
Somewhere between here...

407
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What?
... and the Indian Reservation.

408
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Even the settlers
used horses!

409
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Trust me, if I had a horse,

410
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I would have used it.

411
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hey, I've seen that
guy before.

412
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Outside the casino.

413
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Agh!

414
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Wait!

415
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
What the hell's going on?

416
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We're running for our lives.

417
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Is there any particular reason

418
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
why Cowboys are
trying to kill you?

419
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And Indians!

420
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Cowboys and Indians are
trying to kill you?

421
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What's the deal with
this mask?

422
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's an ancient Apache
warrior mask.

423
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
A what?

424
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's a long story.

425
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,099
Well, give me the
abridged versión.

426
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Ulucky in love...
Unlucky in cards, bitch.

427
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Straight to the 10!

428
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hail to the Queen!

429
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We're going to hail to
the King.

430
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,019
Where's the mask?

431
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,180
Uh!

432
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's a long story.

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well give me the
abridged versión.

434
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And here we are!

435
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Wow!

436
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You know you should
probably call the Sheriff,

437
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
tell him what the
hell is going on.

438
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Sheriffs.

439
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Sheriff's as in plural.

440
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,799
Yup, and they're both
corrupt.

441
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,140
The Chief owns one.

442
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And the Rancher owns
the other one.

443
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Lovely.

444
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So it looks like I'm stuck with you
until I find this mask

445
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I am the Girl Next Door.

446
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
My name is Cindy,
by the way.

447
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't live...

448
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
...never mind, I'm John.

449
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Cool!

450
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,799
I always wanted
an Uncle John.

451
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,160
You have the right
to remain silent.

452
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Two perfect kill shots
through the windshield.

453
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Theories?

454
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,660
Don't know.

455
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,119
These Indians are a little
far from the reservation.

456
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Native Americans.

457
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
What?

458
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
They like to be called,
Native Americans now.

459
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Whatever.

460
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So what are two...
... Native Americans...

461
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
...doing away from the
casino?

462
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In such a crappy car?

463
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Besides getting killed?

464
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,099
Car's got out-of-state
plates, too.

465
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,240
Hmm.

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,779
What you got?

467
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,599
The car...

468
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,440
Belongs to a John Smith.

469
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Two Native Americans
stole the car...

470
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,740
...of a guy named
John Smith?

471
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,920
Well, that's some irony
for you.

472
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I already told you...

473
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
...we can't call the Sheriffs.

474
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm not calling the
Sheriff.

475
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,599
Sheriff's!

476
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Who you calling then?

477
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Nobody.

478
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh I get it...

479
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
...you're going to be like my
crazy Uncle.

480
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You'll be Crazy Uncle John.

481
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
When I was in the apartment
next to yours...

482
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
See, I told you we
were neighbours.

483
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
We're not... Never mind.

484
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
When I was in that
apartment, I noticed

485
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
there were some headshots on
the Wall of the other Elvises.

486
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Now I'm willing to gamble

487
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that in this small town,
that there's not too many

488
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Takashi Toshiros.

489
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I thought you said you
were a terrible gambler.

490
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Nope, I've only lost
in slots, poker...

491
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
...and love.

492
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You'd think in a day
and age of cell phones...

493
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
...the payphone would've died
a horrible death and yet...

494
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
...some remain,

495
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
fighting destiny...

496
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
...marking a...

497
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
simpler time.

498
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's beautiful.

499
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Now give me the mask!

500
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Midget Elvis!

501
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Little person, bitch!

502
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh you said he was a
little touchy about that.

503
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Very touchy.

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Now give me the mask
or I'll blow your balls off!

505
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
She doesn't have balls... you don't have
balls... she doesn't have balls.

506
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm not screwing around!

507
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Look man, I don't have it!

508
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He doesn't! I would
know, he's my neighbour.

509
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm not...

510
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Why does everybody
think I have it?

511
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because you stole it.

512
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,539
I didn't!

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Last chance.

514
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Well what do you think
the cop behind you

515
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
is going to say about it?

516
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

517
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm not falling for that!

518
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Everything all right?

519
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yes, everything's fine.

520
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Because I just hate it...

521
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
...when people make fun of a little person.

522
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No, listen officer we weren't
making fun of a little person

523
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
we're just asking for some
directions. Really.

524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Right? Yup

525
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah. Have a nice day.

526
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,440
Right.
Thank you Deputy.

527
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Looks like Elvis died
on the toilet.

528
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yep.
Again.

529
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
I don't think he's
dead.

530
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Which one?

531
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Which one what?

532
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Which Elvis do you
think is still alive?

533
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The real one, or that
guy?

534
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Both.

535
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Both'?

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Really?

537
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Everybody knows
that the King

538
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
faked his death to get
away from the Colonel...

539
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
...lead a normal life,
live happily ever after.

540
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That guy however,

541
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
is an impersonator.

542
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,480
No shit.

543
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
No actually I'm afraid there is.

544
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
H
g

545
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't start with the
toilet humor. All right.

546
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Too late.

547
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So Sheriff...

548
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
...you've determined in
your expertise...

549
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
...that the dead guy here
is not the real Elvis...

550
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
...but rather an
Elvis impersonator.

551
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
No, Sheriff,

552
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I've determined in my expertise

553
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
that the dead guy is not a
real Elvis impersonator,

554
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
you can tell by the boots.

555
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Any true Elvis lover
would know that the King

556
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
would never be
caught dead in those.

557
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No pun intended.

558
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Hmm. Elvis impersonator...

559
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,780
impersonator.

560
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,659
John Smith.

561
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The owner of the car
with the dead Indians.

562
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Native Americans.

563
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So what do two dead
"Native Americans“

564
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and a dead Elvis impersonator
impersonator have in common?

565
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,380
John Smith.
John Smith.

566
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So this is luxurious
estate of Asian Elvis, huh?

567
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I guess Elvis impersonating
doesn't pay all that well.

568
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So what's your plan?

569
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
My Plan?

570
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I was going to
go in there and demand

571
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
that he give me the mask.

572
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's a popular plan
these days.

573
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Simple and sweet.

574
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,599
I like it.

575
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,079
Very popular plan.

576
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe its the maid's day off?

577
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Sure hate to be the
owner of this place.

578
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's why I rent!

579
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Hey!

580
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And here I thought I'd
have to come after you.

581
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We ahh,
we didn't see you there.

582
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Because Asians are
sneaky, right'?

583
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Starting right off with the
stereotypes.

584
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What?

585
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Give me the mask!

586
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Hey that was your line.

587
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Look, like I'm telling
everybody else,

588
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't have it!

589
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
First you steal the
mask,

590
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
then you kill Alan.

591
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Alan?

592
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Gay Elvis.

593
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Gay Elvis?

594
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Murdered in a train
station bathroom.

595
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
They're hunting down
all the Elvis'

596
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
trying to find the mask.

597
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Heard on my Police scanner that
he was shot on the toilet multiple times.

598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You have a police
scanner?

599
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Of course I do.

600
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Because I'm Asian, I must be
good with technology, right?

601
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What?

602
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Let me guess, you think
every Asian knows karate

603
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I bet computers too.

604
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And I suppose I must've
gotten really good grades in school,

605
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
studied every night,

606
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
all while working at my
parents dry cleaners store

607
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
on the weekend.

608
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Well in my case, that's
just not true.

609
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Except for the Karate part.

610
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hey ah!

611
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
No one's hunting
this Elvis down

612
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,679
you generic
European hybrid.

613
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And who are you
supposed to be?

614
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The Girl Next Door?

615
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Exactly.

616
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well little girl.

617
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Tell me where the
mask is

618
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
or I'm going to open
up a can of

619
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
whoop-ass on you too.

620
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I don't know where the mask is,
I've never even seen the mask.

621
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I suppose you think I
wouldn't hit a girl.

622
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Hey ah!

623
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Wrong again!

624
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Ah, Oh.

625
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I can't believe you
just did that.

626
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I know...

627
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm just breaking every
stereotype today!

628
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Your little White Man's brain
must be ready to explode.

629
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You really are an
asshole, aren't you!

630
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Takes one to know one.

631
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Did you really just
say that?

632
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yes I did.

633
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Now give

634
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
me

635
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the

636
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,599
mask!
Agh!

637
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,239
Yes!

638
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Look behind you.

639
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Look behind me?

640
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Remember the stereotype
little girl,

641
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Asian's are smart.

642
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,539
Not dumb!

643
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,320
I'm here for the mask.

644
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Shocker.

645
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You better pray you're not Elvis.

646
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,139
No no, I'm a Smith.

647
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
John Smith?

648
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah!

649
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Aren't you dead?

650
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I don't think so.

651
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Wait, wait. You're a...

652
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,079
you're the Indian.

653
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Do I look like I'm from India?

654
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I meant uhh... Native
American.

655
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Do I look like I work...

656
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
...at Seven Eleven?

657
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Wait, wait! That's a little
racist too, isn't it!

658
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Suppose you think...

659
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
this a tomahawk?

660
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I was going to say hatchet,
but now that you mention it.

661
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And what? I'm going to
scalp you, is that it?

662
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
No, that would be racially
insensitive of me to think that!

663
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
That's good.

664
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You're not stupid as you look.

665
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,599
Thank you.

666
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But unfortunately for you...

667
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
...it is a tomahawk.

668
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And this Indian...

669
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Help!

670
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,500
...is going to scalp you!

671
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Should have looked
behind you.

672
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Come on, let's go.

673
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Never argue with a
woman.

674
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Look behind you! What are you
three for three with that?

675
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Four for four.

676
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But to be fair, three of the
four times,

677
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
there was actually
someone behind them.

678
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,380
Okay, come on, come on.

679
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That was my first
tomahawking

680
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
what about you?

681
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I changed my mind.

682
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I think we need to call
the Sheriff's.

683
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The mask is worth one
million dollars.

684
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Maybe the sheriff's can
wait a little bit longer.

685
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Not even the
girl next door

686
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
is immune to greed.

687
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Well, I caught it from
my Uncle.

688
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Hey...

689
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
...there's that guy again.

690
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What guy?

691
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That guy from the
casino!

692
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Hey you!

693
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
John, wait!

694
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I want to talk to you for a minute.

695
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
What?

696
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Who are you?

697
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Dude what happened
to your face?

698
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I just got beat up by
an Asian Elvis,

699
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but that is not important
right now.

700
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Really
I saw you outside the casino

701
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
what's you deal?

702
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Dude, unless you want to also
get beat up by a college kid,

703
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'd walk away right now.

704
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No, I'm not going
anywhere man,

705
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
until you tell me why you are
following us.

706
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,300
Okay.

707
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,239
Agh!

708
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Agh! Uh!

709
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Stick to fighting
Elvises, moron.

710
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Huh!

711
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Stop it! Get away from him!

712
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What! He was
asking for it!

713
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I can't believe it!

714
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The Chief's men
were right!

715
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
He actually just crushed
a beer can on my head.

716
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,260
Just get out of here!

717
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'd listen to the lady
if I was you, boy.

718
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,480
Yes sir!

719
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You look good.

720
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Thanks.

721
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You broke my nose, asshole.

722
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I know how you feel.

723
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Are there any Hispanics
in this town

724
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
'cause right now that's the
only ethnicity that

725
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
hasn't kicked my ass yet.

726
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Somebody wants
to talk to you.

727
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Ah!

728
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I can't imagine
what that's about.

729
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,280
I already killed me two
Injun's today.

730
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,619
Don't make me
kill you too.

731
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I want the mask.

732
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well that's refreshing,
usually people say

733
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
"give me the mask",
you went with

734
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
"I want" the mask.

735
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Do you know who I am?

736
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You're the Rancher.

737
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah I was ah, going to
guess the Rancher too.

738
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,960
I own this town.

739
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Several others just like it,
most of the land in-between.

740
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Goverment says I can't own
the Indian Reservation,

741
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
but that doesn't matter, that's
worthless anyway until the...

742
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
...Chief's built his Casino.

743
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
See that, whether
you're rich or poor

744
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
we all have problems.

745
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's been very nice meeting you.
Very enlightening.

746
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Uncle John, I think it's time
to shut up now.

747
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's a smart girl.

748
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,860
I'd listen to her If I was you.

749
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,539
Continue.

750
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
This...

751
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Warrior Mask is where the Apache
gain all their power.

752
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
When it was lost in...

753
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
battle with U.S. Calvalry
they were dfeated

754
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and forced to live as drunks
in the reservation.

755
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
When it was found...

756
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
they became powerful again

757
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and built their casino.

758
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Interestingly, I've heard
this story before.

759
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
From the Indians...

760
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Not with your colorful
descriptions added.

761
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,340
But I bet you don't
know the best part.

762
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The Apache don't make
warrior masks.

763
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Hopi do.

764
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Hopi?

765
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Hopi. It's another tribe.

766
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
There's not many of
them left.

767
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Wich means

768
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
that Chief's tribe
originally stole the mask

769
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
from some other tribe.

770
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And now, like all good
European white man,

771
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
we're gonna take
it from them.

772
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Greed.

773
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What?

774
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Nothing.

775
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Now don't feel too bad
for the savages.

776
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They'll kill to get that mask.

777
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
When they lost it the
firs time

778
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,699
they killed whole family
just to get it back.

779
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Careful, it's very old.

780
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Just like that.

781
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
How did you find it'?

782
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
His new boss sent him out there
looking for old war artifacts and

783
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,840
he finds this.

784
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,679
All right. Let's wrap it up.

785
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That family worked for me.

786
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Mother, Father, Little boy, all killed.

787
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Except for some old Indian woman,
some sort of...

788
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
code of the savages.

789
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
She lives.

790
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Only the white man
dies today.

791
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That's horrible.

792
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Um, so where again did you
say the Father found the mask?

793
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
What's it matter?

794
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
He found it, they killed him,
the Chief got it!

795
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Without that mask the whole tribe

796
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
would still be forced to sork
for me If they weren't too drunk.

797
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
to get off that casspool of a reservation..

798
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But Instead...

799
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
they built a casino

800
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
now make even more money
than I do.

801
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So you hired the Elvises
to steal the mask for yourself.

802
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You exploit whatever weaknesses
our enemy has..

803
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That casino is a fortress.

804
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Only Apache warriors and
Elvis impersonators

805
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
are allowed into the
Chief's Inner sanctum.

806
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So what happened?

807
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I don't know.

808
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But that's why I have
your Uncle John here.

809
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So, Captain Smith, you and...

810
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Pocahontas have 'till tomorrow
to brig me the mask.

811
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
or I'm going to cut off your head
and hang it.

812
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,460
next to all the other
animals on my wall.

813
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Do we understand each other?

814
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,480
Yes sir.

815
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,239
Agh!

816
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
We're right back Where
we started.

817
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
He just threatened to
cut off our heads

818
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Well technically he only threatened
to cut off my head.

819
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well greet,/ feel so
much better.

820
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I won't get killed because of
a technicality.

821
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Well if it makes you
feel any better

822
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
there's plenty of
other people out there

823
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
who are willing to kill
you today.

824
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So how are we going to
find this mask?

825
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
All we know is that an
Elvis has it.

826
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That's all we need to know.

827
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There were five Elvises.

828
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
One of them stole the meek
and betrayed the others-

829
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If you take me outta the equation,
that leaves only four.

830
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Midget Elvis...

831
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I mean little person Elvis...

832
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
...came ater me
looking for the mask.

833
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So we know it wasn't him.

834
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Takashi aka Asian Elvis,

835
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
also demanded the mask
the moment he saw us.

836
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So it couldn't have
been him either

837
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And before he got a
tomahawk in the back

838
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Takashi told us that Alan...

839
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
aka, Gay Elvis...

840
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
had been killed
at the train station.

841
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Which leaves only the
contest winner himself

842
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Elvis... Elvis.

843
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Your neighbour.

844
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But I thought you were
my neighbour.

845
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm your uncle.

846
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm talking about your
real next door neighbour.

847
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,739
So where is this
Elvis-Elvis?

848
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So, if I where an Elvis
impersonator...

849
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
contest winner who just stole an
ancient Apache warrior mask

850
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Worth one million dollars,
where would I be?

851
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Hopi.

852
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
What?

853
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Ancient Hopi warrior mask.

854
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Right.

855
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I do have an idea.

856
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You still think we shouldn't
call the sheriff's'?

857
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
No, we need to find the
mask, save our heads,

858
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
get rich and live
and live happily ever after.

859
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,239
Hmm.

860
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I couldn't agree more.

861
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Midget Elvis!

862
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Little person, asshole!

863
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Sorry.

864
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I knew you bitches would
return to the scene of the crime.

865
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Which crime is he
talking about?

866
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't know. There's been
so many, I've lost track.

867
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's just a figure of speech, dickwad!

868
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I meant you finally
camo back home.

869
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I don't live here.
She lives next door.

870
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,420
Thanks.

871
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You're a sick twisted
bastard, you know that.

872
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Having all our pictures
taped to your wall...

873
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
...jerking off to them at night!

874
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What?
That is pretty sick.

875
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It wasn't good enough for you
just to steal the mask.

876
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No you had to live out your perverted
fantasies and kill all of us.

877
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You get off on that, don't you?

878
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What the hell are you
talking about?

879
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
First you kill Gay Elvis...

880
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
in a bathroom stall no less!

881
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Then you kill Asina Elvis...

882
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
by thrusting a hatchet
into his back!

883
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Hey wait. It wasn't a hatchet,
it was a tomahawk.

884
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Apparently there is
a difference.

885
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And now you want to try
and kill me.

886
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Well ass wipe...

887
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
it's not going to happen!

888
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Excuse me, in Uncle
John's defense

889
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
he didn't kill any of
those people.

890
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
The Indian did... l think.

891
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Uncle John?

892
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So now you're screwing
your niece?

893
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Damn! You are one
perverted bastard!

894
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
No, no. It's not like that.
She's my neighbour.

895
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Not actually my neighbour...

896
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Now tell me where the mask is

897
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,280
before I cut you both
down to my size!

898
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,860
Yes, tell us where the
mask is.

899
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Nice outfit.

900
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Thank you.

901
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,260
Who the hell are you?

902
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's some visitor, I murdered,

903
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
tapping at my
chamber door.

904
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This it is, and nothing
more.

905
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Edgar Allen Poe?

906
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
An educated man.

907
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Then you're smart
enough to know

908
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
who will be walking out of here
with that duffle bag.

909
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,500
Did you jurt threaten me?

910
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Because bitch, this midget will
fuck you up!

911
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Ahh, little person.

912
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Whatever!

913
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,980
Oh I've had about
enough of this.

914
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,300
Aghh!

915
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,179
Uh!

916
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,239
Hmm.

917
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
How many assassins do
they have in this town!

918
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh!

919
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Ouch!

920
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,440
That looks like
it hurt.

921
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,320
John Smith, I presume.

922
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah.

923
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well we just heard gunshots.

924
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We going to find another...

925
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
dead body up there?

926
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Probably.

927
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Imagine that.

928
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We follow the address written
on the hand of a dead Indian...

929
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Native American.

930
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Native American, lying in a pool
of blood next to another dead...

931
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Native American in a car...

932
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
registered to you.

933
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And we find your credit
card lying on the body

934
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
of a dead Elvis
impersonator-impersonator

935
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
in the bathroom of a
train station.

936
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And now here you are.

937
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I haven't killed
anybody.

938
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Who said you did?

939
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So, ahh, upstairs...

940
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
are we going to find a
dead Elvis...

941
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
or dead Indian.

942
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Native American.

943
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,539
Whatever.

944
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Probably an Elvis.

945
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,579
Agh! I'm tellin' ya,
you got the wrong guy.

946
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Somebody else.

947
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I like that, somebody else.

948
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
What about the girl you
were with?

949
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
No, you don't want her either,
she doesn't know anything,

950
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
she's just the girl next door.

951
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Next door to the apartment
that you say you don't live in.

952
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Right.

953
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Okay Mr. Smith we're going to
hold you in this car for 12...

954
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Make it 24.

955
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
24 hours!

956
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
We'll see if anymore dead
people show up.

957
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That's not going to
work for me. Okay!

958
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
A lot of stuff is going to happen
in the next 12 to 24 hours.

959
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Sorry jail's cutting into
your busy schedule.

960
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You could always tell us what's
relly going on

961
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,500
and speed up the process.

962
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Native Americans, Cowboys,
Elvis Impersonators, and Blonde Women

963
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
they are all trying to kill me.

964
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Any particular reason?

965
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
They don't like me?

966
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
We're going to let you in on
a little secret here, John.

967
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
We don't
like you either.

968
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,380
See you in the morning.

969
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
None of the settlerd liked
the real John Smith either.

970
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Neither did the Indians.

971
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But they all needed him
to survive.

972
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
They tried to
kill him too.

973
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
You stole my wallet.

974
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah. But it had no money in it.

975
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
What are you doing in
here anyway?

976
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Solicitation.

977
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You're a prostitute?

978
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,679
Yes, John. I'm a prostitute.

979
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
So what's the deal
with the mask?

980
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You know where it is?

981
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You too? How do you
know about it?

982
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
John like to talk during sex.

983
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
We didn't have sex.

984
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Not you...

985
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Heeyah, heeyah!

986
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I was doing this guy
named the Cowboy.

987
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Giddyup, giddyup!

988
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
The Elvises stole the
Chief's mask.

989
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Gaw dang it Mo, I'm a little busy,
can't you see!

990
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They haven't reported in.

991
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
The Rancher is asking
for ya'.

992
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh hell, why didn't
you say so.

993
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Uh.

994
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's it?

995
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I got to go find me
some Elvises.

996
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Pay the gal.

997
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Few minutes later the Sheriff's
came and arrested me.

998
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
At least somebody came.

999
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You would have had a
better time with me.

1000
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,139
I like giris, John.

1001
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So what happened to your face?

1002
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You weren't this ugly
the last time I saw you.

1003
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
There's a lot of bad
people out there.

1004
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
There's some in here too.

1005
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Aren't you a murderer?

1006
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's funny.

1007
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You know they found
my credit card

1008
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
that you stole at one
of the crime scenes.

1009
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I'll make you a deal.

1010
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'll talk to the Sheriff's
and get you off...

1011
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
no pun intended...

1012
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
If you tell me where
the mask is.

1013
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Looks like you and I will be spending
the night together after all

1014
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
because right now I have
no idea where that mask is.

1015
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You where in that Elvis contest.

1016
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You played poker with
those guys,

1017
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I know you know something.

1018
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Goodnight my sweet love.

1019
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,239
Men!

1020
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I woke feeling not too bad.

1021
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
True, I was in jail.

1022
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
A whole bunch of people
were trying to kill me.

1023
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But somehow I felt today was
going to be better than yesterday.

1024
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Rise and shine, Mr. Smith!

1025
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Or maybe not.

1026
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The girl next door,
posted your bail.

1027
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Don't I need to be charged
with something first?

1028
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'd stop talking if I were you,
we're letting you out.

1029
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's called a bribe.

1030
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Anything new you want to
tell us this morning, John'?

1031
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I couldn't get laid by
a prostitute,

1032
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you know what that does
to a man's ego?

1033
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I can tell you something new this
morning, Sheriff's.

1034
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm listening.

1035
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,619
Will it get me out of here?

1036
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Depends on what you
tell us, sugar.

1037
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The Chief's ancient Apache
warrior mask

1038
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
was stolen by bunch of Elvis
impersonators.

1039
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And he knows where it is.

1040
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I do not!
Really?

1041
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Sheriff's come in.

1042
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,159
Sheriff Hutchins. What
is it Deputy.

1043
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
There is broken down car
off Highway 18.

1044
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Uregistered.

1045
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,320
No sign of the driver.

1046
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
There's a cut water hose and a

1047
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
bone dry radiator.

1048
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Who goes out into the desert without
checking their water level?

1049
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Anything inside the
vehicle honey.

1050
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The only thing is a Elvis trophy.

1051
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Say again.

1052
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
A first place Elvis Impersonation
contest trophy.

1053
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,719
Pretty cool.

1054
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Keep me posted.
Hutchin's out.

1055
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Told you.

1056
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's go Mr. Smith.

1057
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Hey, what about me?

1058
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
When I get back
I'll let you blow me,

1059
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
then we'll talk about it.

1060
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Wow...

1061
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
you sure know how to make a
girl feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

1062
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,960
Bye bye my love.

1063
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Thank you for getting me
the hell out of there.

1064
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Wasn't cheap.

1065
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But I didn't want to have a
jailbird for an uncle.

1066
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
What would the other
kids say.

1067
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,900
Mmm, thank you,

1068
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I owe you.

1069
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So what's the plan?

1070
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
There's a plan?

1071
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I hope so.

1072
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I mean the Rancher hired the
Elvises to steal the mask.

1073
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And the head Elvis screwed
over the other Elvises.

1074
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Framed you and then
took the mask for himself.

1075
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
He's probably going to try and
sell it to the highest bidder.

1076
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So where do you
think he is?

1077
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That is the million dollar
question isn't it?

1078
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Literally.

1079
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You said you
had an idea, though.

1080
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I do have an idea.
Did I?

1081
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Yeah, that was the last
think you said to me

1082
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
before blonde assassins
started killing midget Elvises.

1083
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Little person Elvises.

1084
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Whatever.

1085
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,599
Him again.

1086
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Stop. Remember what
happened last time.

1087
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,260
I'll take care of it.

1088
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,360
Women.

1089
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Wise men say...

1090
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
only fools fall in love.

1091
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's not fools fall in love,
it's fools rush in.

1092
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Oh you're going to correct me
on my Elvis lyrics now.

1093
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yep
Didn't she just pay you guys off?

1094
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Ow
Hey!

1095
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Bribery is against the
law, Mr. Smith.

1096
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We call it consulting fees.

1097
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You know that's her
boyfriend, don't you'?

1098
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That's her boyfriend?

1099
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Ex-boyfriend, thank you
very much.

1100
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,780
Are we ready?

1101
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Where we going?

1102
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You're going to help us
find that mask...

1103
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
...cause I hear it's worth
a lot of money.

1104
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
That wasn't part of the deal.

1105
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
We're changing the deal.

1106
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm assuming you don't mind
sitting in the back.

1107
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Do I have a choice?

1108
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I could get you two in
a lot of trouble.

1109
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,860
Ooh... Tell it to the
Sheriffs.

1110
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,659
You coming?

1111
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Sorry
Oh don't worry about it.

1112
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Why's your ex-boyfriend
following me?

1113
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
He's not following you.
He's following me.

1114
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But the Sheriffs won't
do anything about it!

1115
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
What was he doing at
the casino?

1116
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That was before
I even met you.

1117
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
He's got a gambling problem.

1118
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That's why we broke up.

1119
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
She said she was high-classed

1120
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
but that was just a lie.

1121
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
See, I got that lyric correct.

1122
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,960
You're a genius.

1123
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,619
Where we headin' Mr. Smith.

1124
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We're looking for the
driver of the car

1125
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
that your Deputy found
on Highway 18.

1126
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
If he didn't die of
heat stroke,

1127
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,099
there's only one place
he could be.

1128
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,840
Be right back.

1129
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I think you guys better get
here pretty fast.

1130
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,739
There's a new player in town.

1131
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The angels...

1132
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
...not half so happy in heaven,

1133
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
went envying her and me.

1134
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That was the reason as
all men know...

1135
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
...in this kingdom by
the sea...

1136
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
...that the wind came out
of the cloud by night.

1137
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Chilling....

1138
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And killing...

1139
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
...my Annabel Lee.

1140
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
What?

1141
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,780
Wrong answer.

1142
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,239
Agh!

1143
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,960
What's so funny?

1144
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,679
Elvis has left the
building.

1145
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
For the moon never beams
without bringing me dreams

1146
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

1147
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What?

1148
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Nice satellite phone.

1149
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Cells don't work out here.

1150
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Interesting.

1151
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Did you just call the
Rancher...

1152
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
...or the Chief?

1153
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Both.

1154
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Really?

1155
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I work for the Rancher,
but I owe money to the Chief.

1156
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Playing both sides.

1157
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I like that.

1158
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,980
Well, give them a
message for me.

1159
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
See we made it.

1160
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
After how many hours of
wrong turns'?

1161
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Next time I'm driving.

1162
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Like you could find a
bus stop

1163
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
in the middle of the
desert any faster.

1164
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Don't I take you to all
the best places?

1165
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Whatever happened to
dinner and a movie?

1166
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Shut up.

1167
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Looks like the cowboy
is already here.

1168
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Cowboy, he's the one
that took a shot at us.

1169
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Did he hit you'?

1170
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
No.

1171
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,480
Too bad.

1172
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's the Sheriffs!

1173
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,500
Come on outta there boys.

1174
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Sheriffs.

1175
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,380
What can we do for you?

1176
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,800
We're here for the
mask. Mo...

1177
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well ain't we all.

1178
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Elvis in there?

1179
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Elvis is dead.

1180
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,760
Put down your guns and
step away from the bus!

1181
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I told you we didn't
kill the Elvises.

1182
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Shut up!

1183
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Sheriff Covley, I understand the
Rancher pays you real good.

1184
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So I'm going to give you
a little advice.

1185
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
You take that other
sheriff there,

1186
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and you get in your vehicle

1187
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and you ride on outta here.

1188
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
'Till I tell you It's okay
to come back.

1189
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Yeah, about that.

1190
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
See ahh...

1191
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
...this mask seems to be...

1192
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
...pretty valuable.

1193
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We're going to be
renegotiating my contract.

1194
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He works for the Chief.

1195
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
We work for whoever is
willing to pay us

1196
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
the most for that mask.

1197
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Think of it like there's
two new Sheriffs in town.

1198
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And they're even greedier
than the last ones.

1199
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So ah...

1200
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
...like that other Sheriff said...

1201
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
...drop your guns...

1202
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
...and step away from
the bus!

1203
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Careful Sheriff.

1204
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,860
I hear he's a pretty good shot.

1205
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,320
I'm also a quick draw.

1206
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
This town wasn't big enough
for the both of them.

1207
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Either of them.

1208
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,019
Hell any of them.

1209
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
John Smith!

1210
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,579
The Rancher gave you 24 hourd
to get us the

1211
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,639
Cowboys and Indians, just like
the old days.

1212
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We both know how
that turned out.

1213
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
We need to see who's in
that bus.

1214
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Situation's a little volatile
right now don't you think?

1215
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,480
Exactly.

1216
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,239
Agh!

1217
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Talk is cheap white man.

1218
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,380
Just like the old days.

1219
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,239
Agh!

1220
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Agh! Agh!

1221
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You seem to be difficult to kill
as your namesake.

1222
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
John Smith was sentenced
to death three times,

1223
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
twice by his own people!

1224
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
He was spared each time!

1225
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,980
You think you ought to
be spared?

1226
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,739
Kill 'em.
Let's get the mask.

1227
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Wait! Wait!
No! No! Wait!

1228
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You can't kill him!

1229
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Why not?

1230
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Just like Pocahontas, you're
not eleven, are you?

1231
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Because if you want your mask,
you have to bring him...

1232
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
...and the money.

1233
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Slight twist on
Pocahontas.

1234
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
She's right.

1235
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,860
That's what it says
on the bus.

1236
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You're making the right
choice, Chief.

1237
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,599
Thank you.

1238
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Where do we go then?

1239
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,659
Station 12.

1240
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Station 72 was an old west outpost...

1241
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
on the border of the Chief's
reservation.

1242
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It was once
Native American land,

1243
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
the site of a long
forgotten skirmish...

1244
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
...between the tribe
and the U.S. Cavalry.

1245
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
To keep the peace...

1246
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
no-one was supposed
to go the-re.

1247
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Thanks for not killing
me earlier, by the way.

1248
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You can thank your girl
next door for that.

1249
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Thanks for that.

1250
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
The Rancher also wants
him dead.

1251
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Maybe the Rancher isn't
so bad after all.

1252
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Being Native American,
doesn't it tug at your soul,

1253
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
knowing everyone
wants me dead?

1254
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Indian.

1255
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Excuse me?

1256
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I'm Indian.

1257
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I thought all you guys wanted
to be called Native American.

1258
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
No, no moron.
I'm from India.

1259
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
The Chief and his casino

1260
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
are equal opportunity
employers.

1261
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Not everyone is a racist
white man like you.

1262
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I did not see that one
coming.

1263
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,019
Well, we're here.

1264
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,920
Glad you boys could
all make it.

1265
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,880
Bet you never thought
you'd be back here, Chief.

1266
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I could kill him right now.

1267
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And end this war once
and for all.

1268
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I wouldn't advise that
If I were you.

1269
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'm a pretty good shot.

1270
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,079
So was the Cowboy.

1271
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
You're outnumbered Rancher.

1272
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,720
Not exactly.

1273
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Where'd that come from?

1274
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Took it from the
Sheriff.

1275
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Just like the Indian did.

1276
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Which Indian?

1277
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
The one from India.

1278
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You don't have to do this.

1279
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Everything's going to be fine.

1280
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I know it is.

1281
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You just need to choose which
side you're on, Uncle.

1282
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Pocahontas would never shoot
her father, Chief Powhatan.

1283
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The Chief isn't my father.

1284
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
The Rancher is.

1285
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,899
That's my girl.

1286
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
No, no, no.
You're just the girl next door.

1287
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
You don't even live there.

1288
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I don't live there either.

1289
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So your ex-boyfriend was
really following me around hey?

1290
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,020
Of course he was.

1291
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
How do you think I knew
you were in that apartment?

1292
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And neither the
angels in heaven above...

1293
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
...nor the demons
down under the sea...

1294
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
...can ever dissever my
soul from the soul...

1295
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
...of the beautiful
Annabel Lee.

1296
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Now everyone drop
the guns.

1297
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,439
Or no one gets
anything.

1298
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,039
You can all kill each
other later.

1299
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,760
Good. Now I assume you
both brought the money.

1300
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,199
One million dollars.

1301
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
One million dollars.

1302
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
How do we know you have
what you say you have?

1303
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I have it.

1304
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So who are you going to
sell it to?

1305
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Send John Smith in here
with all the money...

1306
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
...and then we'll see what
side wants it the most.

1307
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,199
I got a better idea.

1308
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
As I was saying...

1309
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Give John Smith the money...

1310
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,920
...and I will give him the mask.

1311
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
The rest of you...

1312
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,619
...don't bother getting up.

1313
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,960
Head on my wall.

1314
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,960
I'm sorry, John.

1315
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,420
Me too.

1316
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,479
Why him?

1317
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Captain John Smith was friend
and foe of Native Americans

1318
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and White Men alike.

1319
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Sentenced to death by both.

1320
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Killed by neither.

1321
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I thought would be poetic.

1322
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,960
Are you serious?

1323
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,180
No.

1324
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You never dressed like
this when we were together.

1325
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You never turned me on
enough.

1326
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,300
Ouch.

1327
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Hello, Annabel.

1328
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,659
Hello, Lee.

1329
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I thought you weren't
interested in any of this stuff.

1330
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Especially being in love with
your doctor and all.

1331
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Well this is a lot of
money.

1332
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And she isn't a doctor.

1333
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,239
She?

1334
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,460
Everything that Elvis
has is in that bag.

1335
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You once said that ah...

1336
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
...history would be written
without me in it.

1337
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And I was right.

1338
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Still, you could have told me
you were coming.

1339
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But what fun would that
have been'?

1340
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,859
You know how I feel
about guns.

1341
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Suit yourself.

1342
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
What are you going to
tell them?

1343
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,720
Nevermore...

1344
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
What are you waiting for?

1345
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Nothing...

1346
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
...just enjoying seeing all
you guys down in the dirt.

1347
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I am going to kill you.

1348
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Not If I kill him first.

1349
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I've been dead before.

1350
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
30 years ago, Chief

1351
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Your men killed my entire family,
right here.

1352
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
The Rancher had sent them

1353
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
to a place no one
was supposed to go.

1354
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
The burial ground of a battle your
tribe had with the U.S. Cavalry.

1355
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Just like the Rancher guessed..

1356
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
...my family found the warrior mask.

1357
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And also just like the
rancher guessed.

1358
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The Chief ordered them killed
for breaking the peace

1359
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and desecrating the ground.

1360
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
My family had no idea
where they'd been sent.

1361
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Or that they were pawns
in a centuries old fight.

1362
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You couldn't have been part
of that family.

1363
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The Indians killed all of them.

1364
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The Native Americans
killed them all.

1365
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Except for a little boy.

1366
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Boy who had been saved
by another Native American.

1367
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,380
My Farher's Hopi guide.

1368
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,159
Go to the highway wait
for me there.

1369
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
They were just student
archaeologists...

1370
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,600
...they had no idea they were
doing your dirty work for you.

1371
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
That's my ride.

1372
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,659
I gotta go.

1373
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,720
Who is that?

1374
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Her!

1375
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,220
We'll leave you a
present at the car.

1376
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,300
Nice.

1377
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,960
Where's my mask?

1378
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Your mask, Chief?

1379
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,140
Elvis destroyed it.

1380
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,300
What?

1381
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,020
The mask is gone.

1382
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,380
I threw it off a cliff.

1383
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I guess he thought that if he

1384
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
wasn't going to
get paid for it.

1385
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
No one should.

1386
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,739
But don't feel too bad Chief.

1387
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Then Rancher's covering
this one.

1388
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The greedy white man
screwed over...

1389
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
...your Tribe for a
long time Chief.

1390
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
For the last 30 years

1391
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
you've been able to do
a little screwing back.

1392
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
You're just going to
have to do it now...

1393
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
...without an ancient
Apache Warrior mask.

1394
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And I'm taking the
other briefcase,

1395
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,039
...for what happened to
my family.

1396
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,960
This ain't over.

1397
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Be nice.

1398
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,100
I'd hate to have
to come back here.

1399
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
What's so funny, Chief?

1400
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,359
Greed.

1401
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
What about the money?

1402
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And John Smith, Chief?

1403
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,760
There's still a million
dollars in that house.

1404
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So really, it was the white man

1405
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
versus the white men
versus the Indians.

1406
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
versus the Indians.

1407
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
The Elvises were there at
the casino to steal the mask.

1408
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Given the Chief's love
for the King...

1409
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
...they had even been
given a private room...

1410
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
...right down the hall
from the Chief's office.

1411
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That casino is a fortress.

1412
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Only Apache warriors

1413
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and Elvis impersonators
are allowed

1414
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
in the Chief's Inner sanctum.

1415
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I got to use the little
boy's room.

1416
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So after doing some hard core losing.

1417
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I excused myself.

1418
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,560
And took care of
business.

1419
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,260
Where the hell is it?

1420
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Looks like we've been
set up boys.

1421
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,319
Every man for himself.

1422
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But only an Elvis
contest winner...

1423
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,340
could walk out of that
casino unscathed

1424
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Hi.

1425
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Sorry son.

1426
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,619
There can
only be one king.

1427
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And that King...

1428
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
put me in my place

1429
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,300
Crap.

1430
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Now if you're going to call in all bet.

1431
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,060
You better make sure you 're
holding all the cards-

1432
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,060
And of course, Elvis-Elvis
didn't destroy the mask.

1433
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,100
I can't believe they
fell for that.

1434
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Well, actually I can.

1435
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
My ex, Annabel...

1436
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,560
can be a pretty good liar.

1437
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,680
Elvis has left the building.

1438
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
She left me for a doctor?

1439
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,640
Yeah, by doctor you
mean lesbian prostitute.

1440
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,060
And they both always
had my best interests in mind.

1441
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,659
John Smith.

1442
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,819
But luckily I made sure
and stacked the deck...

1443
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,239
...in my favor, before I ever
walked into that casino.

1444
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,100
But Annabel did leave
me a present.

1445
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
The Rancher was right
about one thing.

1446
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It wasn't an ancient Apache
warrior mask that was stoten...

1447
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
...It was an ancient Hopi
warrior mask.

1448
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,640
And it was the Hopi that should
get it back.

1449
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But being a greedy
White man...

1450
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
...I did take the
Chief's treasure...

1451
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,840
and his money.

1452
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Just like the real John Smith.

1453
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Of course, I wasn't
John Smith at all.

1454
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,199
That random guy was.

1455
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,960
Huh. John Smith.

1456
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Well that's a good name for
an Indian Reservation.

1457
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,920
Yup. I was just an impersonator.

1458
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,079
A really good one.

1459
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,380
Not a bad Elvis either.

1460
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,840
ROCK THIS TOWN
