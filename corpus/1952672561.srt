1
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:21,357
Moanin' Low, my sweet man I love him so

2
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,861
though he's mean as can be

3
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:30,567
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me

4
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,702
a woman like me...

5
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:34,971
a woman like me...
a woman like me...

6
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,207
a woman like me...
a woman like me...

7
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:52,020
a woman like me...
a woman like me...

8
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:49,921
Rick wants to hire me! He's at a new studio.

9
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,525
Where is it?

10
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,173
India!

11
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:03,966
When?

12
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:04,967
I don't remember what year...

13
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:05,968
there's no year...

14
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,970
How do you know there's a year for that?

15
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,540
I think they say the 14th Century.

16
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,742
The 14th Century was recently.

17
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:13,976
No, but...I don't know...

18
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,571
That's when...the Moghuls were ruling, Babar was in India

19
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,336
The 11th then?

20
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,982
It's definitely B.C.

21
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,984
It's B.C. for sure

22
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,988
and I think it's Ayodhya, where Ram was born

23
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,991
I know that because they razed that temple.

24
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,993
They say that Ram was born there. Which I don't believe -

25
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:31,994
- but that's what they say.

26
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:35,998
And Ayodhya is in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

27
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,000
It's right there! Therefore the story has to be true.

28
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,005
It's probably based on as real as event as the Bible is based on.

29
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,008
You want to know the whole story?

30
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:50,012
Oh, because Ram's father had 4 wives.

31
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,013
-3 wives.

32
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,014
3 wives?

33
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,015
-4 sons.

34
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,817
4 sons, 3 wives. OK.

35
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:56,219
I know the names of the sons by the way.

36
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,020
Kausalya...

37
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,147
No, that's the wife, that's what I meant.

38
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,960
Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi.

39
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,963
And Kausalya's son was Ram

40
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:08,965
Sumitra's son was Laxman

41
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,742
Kaikeyi's son was Bharat

42
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:11,968
I'm so impressed!

43
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:12,969
Yes, and

44
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:16,973
Shatrughan I think was Laxman's brother which means he had to be, uh

45
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:18,774
Sumitra's son.

46
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,977
Sita was Ram's wife

47
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:25,314
Right, and Sita I know also, Sita's father was Janaka.

48
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:27,984
Sita has many names, Sita only being one of them.

49
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:28,985
Yeah.

50
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:29,986
Janaki! Janaki!

51
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,988
Janaki also.

52
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:34,991
And Vahish, Vahish, uh...

53
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:36,993
I saw a play -
Vaidehi.
-huh?

54
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:41,998
Vaidehi, I saw a play called Vaidehi, right, which I learned was another name for Sita.

55
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:46,335
Ram was about to be crowned by Dasharatha as the king

56
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,744
and Kaikeyi went to him and

57
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:52,008
Because she had done something really good

58
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:54,010
I think she had taken care of him when he was really sick.

59
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,478
Yes.

60
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:58,014
And so at that point he had said to her,

61
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:01,584
"You have one Boon. Anything you ask of me I will do."

62
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,954
and so she went and asked him to send Ram away for 14 years

63
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,957
thinking that was a long enough time, that if you go away for 14 years,

64
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:10,653
you're pretty much out of sight, out of mind.

65
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:33,449
Rama my son, today I wish to crown you King of Ayodhya

66
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,218
but my evil scheming wife Kaikeyi-

67
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,310
Grrr...

68
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,990
-just reminded me of an ancient vow I made.

69
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,994
To honor this vow, instead of crowning you king, I must

70
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:48,229
banish you to the forest for 14 years!

71
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:53,736
Goodbye, dear boy. You are noble and good.

72
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,738
The embodiment of righteousness.

73
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,740
A brave warrior prince.

74
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,009
Joy of Heaven and Earth.

75
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,011
The Ideal Man.

76
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,696
May the Gods be with you.

77
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:08,517
Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.

78
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:13,022
That's what she asked for and Dasharatha was heartbroken

79
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:17,026
but given that all Indian men are true to their word...

80
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:21,030
He had to... do that.

81
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,963
And then he died? Didn't he die?

82
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,033
No, I don't think...

83
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,034
He died eventually...

84
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:30,039
No, but all those Ram Leelas I've seen when I was a kid...

85
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,807
He died right away?

86
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,043
There's this big scene, very dramatic

87
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:37,046
he's having a heart attack when his son is going away.

88
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:40,049
I do think he was unwell...

89
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:41,050
Yeah that's true.

90
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,052
And he also has a huge issue, right?

91
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:46,655
He's like ravaged by guilt, because Ram is such a good son.

92
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,624
And Ram, when he was told to go away,

93
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:51,060
actually said he would. He didn't create any problems, he didn't say,

94
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,061
"why?"

95
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:53,062
He just said,

96
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:56,065
"If that is your wish Father, I shall go."

97
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,066
And then he went.

98
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,069
And Sita said, "If you go, I go."

99
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,608
No, Sita.

100
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:06,008
The forest is beset by Rakshasa demons.

101
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:10,713
They harrass our Wise Men and desecrate their ritual fires.

102
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:14,650
I must fight them... alone.

103
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,021
But Rama, a woman's place is next to her Husband!

104
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,023
I will accept any hardship.

105
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:23,472
I cannot live without you...

106
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:31,091
I cannot live without you...
I cannot live without you...

107
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:50,576
I hate to think what might have been if we had never met

108
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:56,625
Why should I suppose that this could be?

109
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:02,689
The weary days, the lonely nights, are easy to forget

110
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:09,403
since I am here, and you are here with me.

111
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:16,405
Here we are, you and I

112
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:22,782
let the World hurry by

113
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:29,685
Even while I waited, somehow, dear, I knew

114
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:36,726
You'd find me, I'd find you

115
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:43,562
Here we are, alone together

116
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:50,307
what matter whether, we wandered far?

117
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:55,050
And though we haven't got a bankful,

118
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,287
we can still be thankful

119
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:04,089
that here, that here we are!

120
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:39,723
Here we are, you and I

121
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:46,668
Let the World just hurry by

122
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:53,835
Even while I waited, somehow, dear, I knew

123
00:13:53,876 --> 00:14:00,179
you'd find me, and I'd find you

124
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:07,320
Here we are, alone together

125
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:14,489
what matter whether we wandered far?

126
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,435
and though we haven't got a bankful,

127
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,571
we can still be thankful

128
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:28,976
that here we are!

129
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:31,677
That's all!

130
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,024
I'll miss you.

131
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:46,518
It's only a 6-month contract. I'll be back before you know it!

132
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:05,981
Ravana was the evil king of Lanka

133
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:10,986
and he just stole Sita.

134
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:13,989
He was an incredibly learned man.  From what I understand, Ravana was...

135
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,992
Actually the only bad thing he seems to have done...

136
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:19,528
...is capture Sita.

137
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,998
Which is kind of interesting because everything else about him seems to be, like

138
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:25,000
he was this really learned guy,

139
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,001
he knows all these weapons

140
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,170
he prays to the right Gods...

141
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,273
so all this stuff! He's like this Good King.

142
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:35,010
Except that, over time, we've been led to believe he's this complete...

143
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,013
that he's like Mogambo.

144
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:41,016
That's right, he lived on an island also!

145
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:45,020
He was a devoted Shiva-bhakta.

146
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,022
and he plays -
-all these instruments...

147
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:50,025
Veena with his intestines.

148
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,027
With his intestines?

149
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:54,029
Yeah, for Shiva.

150
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,500
There's this whole thing about how devoted a fan he was

151
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,438
and he's asking Lord Shiva for some wish

152
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:08,143
and, you know, he is basically playing Veena with his intestines.

153
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,979
It's hard to fell someone like that in battle, because

154
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:13,482
what is pain to a man who plays Veena on his intestines?

155
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:15,084
Nothing much.

156
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,986
What I'm really impressed with is he was the king of Sri Lanka.

157
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,989
No, he was the king of Lanka.

158
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,992
It was Lanka. It's called Ceylon. It's the same country I think.

159
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,994
Well the point is that's what we think.

160
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:26,995
They built the bridge.

161
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:30,999
The bridge still exists, so NASA images say.

162
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:36,004
Really? NASA? It must be true then!

163
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:39,007
Maybe they saw it when they were on the moon!

164
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,544
Isn't the Suruphanaka story - Suruphanaka right?

165
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,013
Surphanaka.

166
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:47,015
I'm messing up her name. God, they're gonna be after me

167
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:49,351
Surphanaka is the one with the really ugly nose.

168
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:51,520
Surphanaka. But she was Ravana's sister.

169
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,025
Ravana! Rama has slaughtered your Rakshasas in the forest. You must take revenge!

170
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:02,364
Don't do it, Master. Rama is powerful.

171
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:06,926
Sister, do not bother me with your petty concerns.

172
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,976
Dear Brother Ravana, have you seen Rama's wife Sita?

173
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:17,980
She is the most beautiful woman in the world.

174
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,550
Her skin is fair like the lotus blossom.

175
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,419
Her eyes are like lotus pools.

176
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,390
Her hands are like, um, lotuses.

177
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,952
Her breasts like big, round, firm, juicy...

178
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:34,997
Lotuses!

179
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:37,625
Mmmm, ahhhh...

180
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,805
Make Sita your wife, Ravana. Steal her from Rama!

181
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:46,008
Don't do it, Master!

182
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:51,469
I'll hear no arguments from you, Mareecha. You must help me at once.

183
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:57,653
Transform yourself into a beautful golden deer to distract Rama.

184
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:03,025
While Sita is unguarded, I'll grab her!

185
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:09,191
Sita WILL be mine! Hahahahahaaa!

186
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,979
What a beautiful golden deer!

187
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,982
Oh Rama, won't you capture it for me?

188
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,985
I don't know, Sita. It could be a trick!

189
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,487
Oh Rama, pleeeaaase?

190
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:37,993
All right, Sita. You ask for so little and give me so much.

191
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:42,998
But promise you won't leave the hut while I'm gone. The forest is dangerous.

192
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:47,002
I promise! Oh Rama, I love you!

193
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,971
I love you, Sita.

194
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:25,974
Love was blind to me, now it's kind to me,

195
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:29,511
Love has opened my eyes.

196
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:33,849
Since it came to me, life's a game to me

197
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,986
with the sweetest surprise.

198
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:41,990
I never knew how good it was to be

199
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,796
a slave to one who means the world to me.

200
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:53,235
I loved that man from the start, and way down deep in his heart

201
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:58,006
I know he loves me, Heaven knows why

202
00:19:58,006 --> 00:20:03,601
and when he tells me he can't live without me

203
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:08,016
what wouldn't I do for that man?

204
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:13,255
He's not an angel or saint, and what's the odds that he ain't

205
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:18,126
with all his faults I know he'll get by

206
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:23,565
I'll be so true to him, he'll never doubt me

207
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:28,036
What wouldn't I do for that man?

208
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:37,138
Oh, when he lets me lean my, my weary head on his shoulder

209
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:47,284
I close my eyes right there and wish I never grow older

210
00:20:47,518 --> 00:20:52,614
I'll never leave him alone, I'll make his troubles my own

211
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:57,432
I love that man as nobody can

212
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:03,205
I'm just no good when his arms are about me

213
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:07,039
What wouldn't I do for that man?

214
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:12,638
Oh, what wouldn't I do for that man?

215
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:37,039
I'll never leave him alone, I'll make his troubles my own

216
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,044
I love that man better than I do my self

217
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:47,516
I'm just no good when his arms are about me

218
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:51,053
What wouldn't I do for that man?

219
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:58,289
Oh there's not a thing I wouldn't do for my man.

220
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,998
That's all!

221
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:07,002
But you know what Sita does then? How she is able to tell these people where she -

222
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:09,004
She drops her jewelry

223
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:11,006
along the way.

224
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:16,011
And that's how they were able to find her. It went all the way up to Lanka.

225
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:19,014
How many times did she drop the jewelry?

226
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:22,017
She was wearing a whole lot of jewelry in the forest.

227
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:26,021
I mean, no, remember, she's not wearing any jewelry 'cause she left everything

228
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:28,490
before she left Ayodhya and she came -

229
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,791
Oh, she left everything?

230
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,027
Right, she just came in her Sanyasi clothes.

231
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:34,254
Don't challenge these stories.

232
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:38,733
She's gone.

233
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,436
I told her not to leave the hut!

234
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:43,734
Oh how will I ever find her?

235
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,805
Sita!

236
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,770
Sitaaaaaa!

237
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:52,883
Oh Sita, what has become of you?

238
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:57,552
Actually, the origins of Hanuman...

239
00:22:57,552 --> 00:23:00,055
All these demons were attacking the Earth

240
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:03,859
and supposedly all the Gods and everyone went to Vishnu and said,

241
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,994
"Please help us, please help us!"

242
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:09,197
So Vishnu said that he was gonna be born on Earth as Ram.

243
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,376
But he was born as Krishna also, this is very confusing.

244
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:13,001
That's dasavatar, 10 incarnations.

245
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:19,007
So... the 10th one is the last one, not come yet supposedly.

246
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,409
So anyway, he said what we'll do is,

247
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,913
Shiva will be born as someone who helps him.

248
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:28,738
So Shiva was actually... Hanuman is an incarnation of Shiva.

249
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:31,019
Oh I didn't know that.
- I didn't know that either.

250
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,023
Yup. And, so Hanuman is actually born with the sole purpose

251
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:38,593
of eventually meeting up with Ram and helping him.

252
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:40,823
Like that was the reason for his birth.

253
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,998
(sobbing, crying...)

254
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,609
I will help you.

255
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,977
Who are you?

256
00:23:55,977 --> 00:24:01,779
I am Hanuman, the Monkey Warrior! Son of the Wind!

257
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:07,355
I am Rama, Prince of Ayodhya. Let us be allies.

258
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:10,592
I shall be your servant forever.

259
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:13,527
Now go, find Sita!

260
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:50,165
Hello?

261
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:51,132
It's me.

262
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:53,034
Dave! Where are you?

263
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,271
Trivandrum, silly. At home.

264
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:57,772
You have a home phone?

265
00:24:57,772 --> 00:24:59,107
Of course.

266
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:02,210
You've been gone a month and you never e-mailed me your phone number.

267
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,214
I didn't?
Well, I have some good news.

268
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,484
They've extended my contract another year!

269
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:13,221
What? Another year? You said you'd be back in 6 months!

270
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,223
But I like it here.

271
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:18,893
What about me? What about Lexi?

272
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,528
What about our apartment?

273
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:21,586
Uhhhh...

274
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,934
What about US?

275
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:28,956
Don't cry, Nina.

276
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,171
I love you.

277
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,900
You could come here...

278
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:39,139
She sits under a tree.

279
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:40,641
And she weeps.

280
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,616
And thinks of Ram. And prays to Ram.

281
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:48,914
And all these evil people, you know all these movies and all these shows we've seen

282
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,653
all these evil people come and sort of scare her, and she prays to Ram.

283
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:56,665
But the thing is that the women,

284
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:59,268
whatever, the women-demon, who are supposed to protect her,

285
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:03,396
are amazed, by her devotion to Ram.

286
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:05,206
And so Ravana also comes and says,

287
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:08,573
"what can Ram do for you, blah blah blah, that I can't?"

288
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:12,213
but she's still, "Ram will come here and you still have one last chance

289
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:14,549
"because once he comes here, you know,

290
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:16,176
"your ass is grass."

291
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,579
I love you Sita. You must be my wife.

292
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,954
Never. I love only Rama.

293
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,031
I am the chaste and virtuous wife of another man.

294
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:38,005
I belong to Rama as the rays belong to the Sun.

295
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:46,506
Give me back to Rama, or you shall soon hear his mighty bow that resounds like Indra's thunderbolt!

296
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:58,186
The more a man speaks sweetly to a woman, the more she insults him!

297
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:03,155
You have two months to decide, lovely lady.

298
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:07,131
Then you shall share my bed!

299
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:14,570
If you do not marry me, my Rakshasas will slaughter you for my breakfast.

300
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:22,172
Your ugly yellow eyes should fall out of your head as you stare at me so lustfully, Ravana.

301
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,222
The only reason I do not reduce you to ashes with my own blazing power

302
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:30,419
is because Rama has not ordered me to do so.

303
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:36,188
Grrrrowl!

304
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:56,216
When night is creepin', and I should be sleepin' in bed

305
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:03,155
if you were peepin', you'd find that I'm weepin' instead

306
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,827
My lovin' Daddy left his baby again, said he'd come back but he forgot to say when

307
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,428
Night after night I'm cryin', Daddy won't you please come home?

308
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:25,369
Daddy won't you please come home, I'm so lonesome

309
00:28:25,947 --> 00:28:29,178
No one can fill that vacant chair

310
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:32,611
Home isn't home when you're not there

311
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:38,188
No need to knock, the door is open for you

312
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,228
Please, Daddy

313
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:46,656
Even the clock keeps tickin', Daddy won't you please come home?

314
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:52,598
Daddy do you have to roam so very long?

315
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:57,579
There's lots of other new sheiks who would like to be sheikin'

316
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:01,413
haven't slipped yet but I'm liable to weaken

317
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:07,144
Daddy, Daddy won't you please come home?

318
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,046
Please, Daddy

319
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:11,417
Even the clock keeps tickin', Daddy won't you please come home?

320
00:30:11,986 --> 00:30:18,259
Daddy do you have to roam so very long?

321
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:22,897
There's lots of other new sheiks who would like to be sheikin'

322
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:26,628
haven't slipped yet but I'm liable to weaken

323
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:32,237
Daddy, Daddy won't you please come home?

324
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,242
That's all!

325
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,248
She also made her own share of mistakes, in fact she should've just gone back with Hanuman.

326
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:44,285
The whole idea of "my man has to come to save me,"

327
00:30:44,285 --> 00:30:46,020
it's like oh, you're one little tight thing.

328
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,825
Jump on the monkey's back, go back, chill out, hundreds will be fine. OK?

329
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:54,295
But is it possible she didn't trust the monkey altogether?

330
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,297
It is possible.

331
00:30:56,297 --> 00:31:00,301
No. I think she absolutely trusted the monkey

332
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:01,703
but she wanted her man to come.

333
00:31:01,703 --> 00:31:04,238
OK that's another thing, it's like, "You gotta prove it to me baby!"

334
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:07,241
But not only that, she also wanted -

335
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,242
Sorry, go ahead -

336
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:13,247
but she also wanted the evil king to be defeated, like my husband should come and -

337
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:18,453
OK, why don't you go back, so the evil king doesn't have a hostage, and then do it?

338
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:22,790
But it's almost like she was trying to glorify Ram through this whole process.

339
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,894
You know, like, "my man will come and he is capable of this

340
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:30,898
"and he's virtuous, and he will kill Ravan, and..."

341
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:33,492
She's a bloodthirsty woman.

342
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,233
But my question is, were they monkeys? Because they actually -

343
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:06,234
-They could fly

344
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:12,407
not monkeys, um, from what I understand it's different from monkeys, they're...

345
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:16,244
Like from what I understand monkeys are one kind of... one species

346
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:20,248
and then, the Vanars were another species. They were half man, half monkey.

347
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:22,784
OK. Because they had tails though.

348
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,254
Correct. But they're not...

349
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:28,256
Like, yeah. I definitely think the tail and the...

350
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:31,259
They were half... they were definitely half monkey, if not more

351
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:32,352
Yeah but that's what the army was.

352
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:34,671

Because otherwise they were these two brothers, they didn't have any army

353
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:38,266
These two brothers and then all of Sugriv's big army, all the...

354
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:41,269
The Vanar Sena.
-The Vanar Sena, right.

355
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,636
Hanuman! Assemble the Monkey Warriors.

356
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:47,731
We shall cross the sea to Lanka and rescue Sita.

357
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:53,114
Yes, my Lord. We march at once!

358
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:24,206
Who's that knockin'? Don't stand outside there, come on in here!

359
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:28,572
I just had a sort of feeling this morning

360
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:32,616
something good was gonna happen today

361
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:37,213
Now there comes a sound without any warning

362
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:41,659
I just know it's good luck coming my way!

363
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:46,232
Goodness gracious, can it be? Someone's coming back to me

364
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:50,693
Who's that knocking at my door?

365
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:55,276
I've been waiting oh so long, I'll just die if I'm wrong

366
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:58,768
Who's that knocking at my door?

367
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:04,218
I know it can't be the mailman, the coal man, the ice man, they've been here today

368
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:08,177
can't be the grocer, the butcher, the baker, they don't knock that way

369
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:13,227
If my sweetie's there outside, my arms and my heart are open wide

370
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:16,390
Who's that knocking at my door?

371
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:57,226
Me oh my, my oh me, guess I'm having company

372
00:34:57,772 --> 00:35:01,435
Who's that knocking at my door?

373
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,146
See the time? Eight O'Clock. Sounds like a familiar knock

374
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:10,218
Who's that knocking at my door?

375
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:15,223
I know it can't be the milk man, the gas man, the bread man, who always collects

376
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:19,455
I hope that it isn't that butter and egg man, who writes out those checks?

377
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:24,193
If it's my sweet used-to-be, gonna lock him in, lose the key

378
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,000
Who's that knocking at my door?

379
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:51,214
Can't be the plumber, the peddler the parlor, cause I've paid those bills

380
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:55,761
I hope that it isn't the doctor, the dentist, they can't cure my ills

381
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:00,268
If it's someone that I've known, gonna make him feel at home

382
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:05,206
Who's that knocking at my door?

383
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,230
That's all!

384
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,990
Dave!

385
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,675
Mmm, Dave!

386
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:36,226
We're in India. Uh, no... kissing in public.

387
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,436
Let me take your bag.

388
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,162
Well, here you are.

389
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:05,262
Good night.

390
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:27,176
Oh gosh. Later I know what he did. What did he do when he saw her in Lanka?

391
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:30,057
Hug her and kiss her...

392
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:30,887
No I don't think so...

393
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:33,187
No I don't think so. He was very cold.

394
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:35,589
Why was he cold to Sita?

395
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,233
Actually I don't remember. To be honest I'm very shaky on this point...

396
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:40,723
You can make it up...

397
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:28,180
You have lived in another man's house so you are unfit to be my wife.

398
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:29,681
What?

399
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:35,222
I have done my duty in rescuing you from the enemy and avenging the insult to myself.

400
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:39,226
I have terrible suspicions about your character and conduct.

401
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:41,228
Ravana was aware of your beauty.

402
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:45,232
He cannot have kept you in his house for so long without touching you.

403
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:47,962
The very sight of you is painful.

404
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:50,533
You are free to go wherever you want.

405
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:53,001
I have no more use for you, Sita.

406
00:38:54,241 --> 00:39:00,247
If I had known this, I would have killed myself before and spared you this war.

407
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:04,185
Build me a funeral pyre. I cannot bear to live.

408
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:07,780
Despite my virtues, my husband has rejected me.

409
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:12,193
He's obviously doubting her, um, pureness.

410
00:39:12,193 --> 00:39:15,196
I find the whole pureness thing really... odd.

411
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:19,200
I find it really weird that no one is commending Ravan for not forcibly...

412
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,225
I mean I know we shouldn't commend somebody for that, but...

413
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:22,570
What if he raped her?

414
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,038
Yeah but in terms of villians, right?

415
00:39:24,038 --> 00:39:24,738
Yeah...

416
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,241
I mean, we expect villains to be villain-ous.

417
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:31,479
This is a guy that's like, "if you don't come to me willingly, I will not touch you."

418
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:32,012
Right...

419
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:33,673
"I will not force you in my house."

420
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:35,214
"I will not force myself on you..."

421
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:37,010
Well he never had sex with her, did he?

422
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:39,019
No. As Sita proved over and over again.

423
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,214
By trial of fire.

424
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,296
You're mean to me

425
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:59,130
Why must you be mean to me?

426
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,243
Please honey, it seems to me

427
00:40:02,243 --> 00:40:07,148
you love to see me crying. I don't know why

428
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:12,245
I stay home each night when you say you'll phone

429
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:15,122
you don't, and I'm left alone

430
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:18,319
singin' the blues and sighin'.

431
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:25,161
You treat me coldly each day in the year

432
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:28,802
You always scold me

433
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:33,374
whenever somebody is near, dear

434
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:40,047
It must be great fun to be mean to me, you shouldn't

435
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:45,144
Oh can't you see what you mean to me?

436
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:46,180
Sweetheart I love you, think the world of you, but I'm afraid you don't care for me

437
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:52,253
You never show it, don't let me know it, everyone says I'm a fool to be

438
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:58,959
pining the whole day through. Why do you act like you do?

439
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:04,298
You're mean to me, why must you be mean to me

440
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:10,168
Aw gee, honey, it seems to me, you love to see me cryin'

441
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:12,339
Please tell me why

442
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:18,045
I stay at home each night when you say you'll phone

443
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:24,348
You don't, and I'm left alone just singin' the blues and sighin'

444
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:31,325
You treat me coldly each day in the year

445
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:38,999
You always scold me whenever somebody is near, dear

446
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:45,572
It must be great fun for you, can't you see what you're doing to me

447
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:50,532
Please tell me why you're so mean to me!

448
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,277
That's all!

449
00:42:55,416 --> 00:43:01,388
And he's still not convinced, seemed like, after she went through the trial by fire

450
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:02,548
I mean it's almost like-

451
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,327
No but I thought he was convinced. He then, it was peer pressure, later with the washerman-

452
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:07,794
yeah, because the washerman-

453
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:10,097
He was convinced, it wasn't like he doubted her

454
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:11,432
He kind of like was "OK, you are pure."

455
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:14,993
And I think he did hug her and then flowers fell from the heavens or something

456
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:18,706
Whoops. I guess you were pure after all.

457
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:21,709
Will you forgive me, Sita?

458
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:25,805
Of course, Rama. I live only for you.

459
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:50,003
Hey, they want me to attend this meeting so much they're gonna fly me all the way to New York.

460
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,473
5 days, all expenses paid!

461
00:43:52,473 --> 00:43:55,840
That's great. It'll be fun for you.

462
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:08,981
See you next week.

463
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:26,707
No no no, it's a flying chariot, the Gods sent the chariot. I don't know, it's something about -

464
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:27,708
-a Japanese train!-

465
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:32,613
I'm finding it, I found it to be totally cool. It was like the world's first airplane or something.

466
00:44:32,613 --> 00:44:34,715
It was like the first - like they actually flew back.

467
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:35,716
I think it was on a bird.

468
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,707
Was it on a bird?

469
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:40,721
I think it was actually a flying thing of some kind.

470
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,322
They rode a carpet like Aladdin.

471
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:43,724
No, it was like an elaborate structure.

472
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:44,725
Pushpakha!

473
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:48,729
That's what they came back on. The flying chariot.

474
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:50,731
That was one of the Air India jumbo jets also.

475
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:54,735
And there's a movie, a silent movie

476
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:56,737
But that's what I mean, it was this thing.

477
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:59,740
It wasn't a bird -
-Pushpakha Vemanum.
-Yeah. -right.

478
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,638
I guess what is happening was the 14 years were finishing and they had to find a quick way to get back.

479
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:28,702
What does it matter if rain comes your way

480
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:32,706
and raindrops patter along?

481
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:37,711
The rain descending should not make you blue

482
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:43,917
The happy ending is waiting for you

483
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:50,724
Take your share of trouble, face it and don't complain

484
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:58,165
If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.

485
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:05,405
Happiness comes double after a little pain

486
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:11,509
If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.

487
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:19,686
What if your love affair should break up, as they sometimes will

488
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:26,693
When you kiss and make up, boy what a thrill!

489
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:34,234
Sadness ends in gladness, showers are not in vain

490
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:41,341
If you want the rainbow, you must have the rain.

491
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:47,848
Look for brighter weather, oh watch for the Sun again

492
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:54,955
If you want the rainbow then you must have the rain.

493
00:46:54,955 --> 00:47:01,428
Pull yourself together, whistle a happy strain

494
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:07,467
If you want the rainbow then you must have the rain.

495
00:47:07,467 --> 00:47:14,675
So if your lucky star deserts you, and if shadows fall

496
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:21,682
Even though it hurts you, laugh through it all

497
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:28,589
Be a cheerful loser, you have the World to gain

498
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:37,691
If you want the rainbow, why, you just must have the rain.

499
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:53,371
That's all!

500
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,036
Rama, I'm pregnant!

501
00:54:56,036 --> 00:54:58,300
That's wonderful, darling.

502
00:54:58,438 --> 00:55:02,876
Maybe they joined the Mile High Club. On the Pushpakh Veman.

503
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:04,444
We don't know exactly when she got pregnant -

504
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:11,351
Very soon thereafter, which is why it is conceivable that she wasn't pregnant because of Ram.

505
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:12,485
But I think it was Ram.

506
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:14,851
Blasphemy. It is Ram.

507
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:27,722
I'm not like Rama, who would take a woman who's slept in another man's house!

508
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:33,773
No but that happens with the dhobi.
-there's a dhobi story.

509
00:55:33,773 --> 00:55:37,777
You know the dhobi, the launderer -
yeah, the dhobi says that -

510
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:40,780
The dhobi's wife, she's with somebody else and when she comes back

511
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,783
he goes, "What do you think I'm like Ram, to take somebody back now after she's -

512
00:55:43,783 --> 00:55:47,787
You know what a dhobi is right? He's a washerman -
-and when news of that hits Ram -

513
00:55:47,787 --> 00:55:52,747
Ram says, "I cannot rule if my subjects don't respect me and so you'll have to..."

514
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:56,858
Actually that's when he banishes her, sorry.
-Right.

515
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:03,736
Uh, say, Sita, would you like to take a trip?

516
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,284
But we just got here.

517
00:56:05,284 --> 00:56:07,280
Yeah great. Get packing.

518
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:14,747
Brother Laxman, my wife's dubious reputation casts doubt upon my own.

519
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,978
You must drive Sita to the forest and abandon her there.

520
00:56:18,284 --> 00:56:20,343
I cannot have her in my kingdom.

521
00:56:20,653 --> 00:56:24,757
I think basically as a king, he had to sort of do...

522
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:29,762
If the common man was doing that to their wives then why should the king treat his wife any differently kind of a thing.

523
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,765
Like I felt that he let her go not because she was impure,

524
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:37,770
but because he said that to be a king, he needs the respect of his subjects, and he can't be considered -

525
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,305
I don't think he let her go because -

526
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:42,242
I felt that he alwsys had this element of doubt

527
00:56:42,242 --> 00:56:47,780
I mean it coupled with, of course, his virtue that everybody spoke of

528
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:52,547
and you know that he kept his word to his Dad, and then his subjects, his... Kingdom,

529
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:57,482
but I felt like he always had this doubt, that she might not be pure.

530
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:14,741
I feel too bad, I'm feelin' mighty sick and sore

531
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:23,483
So bad I feel, I said I'm feelin' sick and sore and

532
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:30,321
so afraid my man don't love me no more.

533
00:57:32,392 --> 00:57:40,959
Day in, day out, I'm worryin' about those blues

534
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:49,309
Day out, day in, I'm worryin' about bad news

535
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:56,044
I'm so afraid, my man I'm gonna lose.

536
00:57:58,284 --> 00:58:06,726
Moanin' low, my sweet man I love him so, though he's mean as can be

537
00:58:06,726 --> 00:58:13,290
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me

538
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:24,444
Gonna die if sweet man should pass me by, if I die where'll he be?

539
00:58:24,444 --> 00:58:31,509
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me.

540
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:41,853
Don't know any reason why he treats me so poorly, what've I gone and done?

541
00:58:42,595 --> 00:58:51,304
Makes my troubles double with his worries when surely, I ain't deservin' of none

542
00:58:51,304 --> 00:58:59,445
Moanin' low, my sweet man is gonna go, when he goes oh Lordy

543
00:58:59,445 --> 00:59:06,214
He's the kind of man needs a kind of woman like me.

544
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:53,599
Don't know any reason why he treats me so poorly, what've I gone and done?

545
00:59:53,599 --> 01:00:02,342
Makes my troubles double with his worries when surely I ain't deservin' of none

546
01:00:02,342 --> 01:00:11,651
Moanin' low, my sweet man is gonna go, when he goes, Lordy!

547
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:20,081
He's a man that needs a woman just like me.

548
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:24,357
I must have committed a terrible sin in a previous life to deserve such suffering.

549
01:01:24,357 --> 01:01:30,198
Were I not carrying Rama's sons, I would throw myself into the river.

550
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:36,869
She's always shown to be pregnant -
-afterwards

551
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:40,606
No, when she's banished and she's gone into the forest again.

552
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:45,311
And there she meets that... teacher.
-Valmiki.
-Valmiki. Sorry.

553
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:49,145
So that's how Valmiki wrote the Ramayana, because Sita told the story to him.

554
01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:12,604
I'm just a woman, a lonely woman, waitin' on a weary shore

555
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:19,840
I'm just a woman, that's only human, one you should be sorry for.

556
01:02:20,313 --> 01:02:24,150
Got up this morning, along about dawn

557
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,854
Without a warning, I found he was gone.

558
01:02:27,854 --> 01:02:34,327
Why should he do it? How could he do it? He never done it before.

559
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:41,495
Am I blue, Am I blue

560
01:02:41,734 --> 01:02:48,139
Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you

561
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:56,616
Am I blue, You'd be too

562
01:02:56,616 --> 01:03:04,022
If each plan with your man done fell through.

563
01:03:04,223 --> 01:03:12,062
Was a time, I was his only one

564
01:03:12,265 --> 01:03:19,772
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, Lordy.

565
01:03:19,772 --> 01:03:27,110
Was I gay, til today

566
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:33,281
Now he's gone, and we're through, am I blue!

567
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:40,359
As blue as the sky blue

568
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:48,858
You're wondering what do these tears in these eyes tellin' you?

569
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:55,975
No one feels like I do

570
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:56,582
Boo hoo,

571
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,443
Boo hoo,
Boo hoo,

572
01:03:57,443 --> 01:03:58,671
Boo hoo,
Boo hoo,
Boo, hoo...

573
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:05,011
Each plan with my man done fell through.

574
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:13,893
Was a time, I was his only, only, only one

575
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:21,356
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, Lordy!

576
01:04:21,534 --> 01:04:25,471
Was I gay - oh Lord was I gay!

577
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:29,008
Til today - that man went away!

578
01:04:29,008 --> 01:04:35,436
Now he's gone, and we're through, am I blue!

579
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:52,865
Anyway, so Luv and Kush, or Luva and Kusha, were born to Sita in the forest

580
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:59,805
and were taught by Valmiki, who taught them all these songs praising Ram.

581
01:05:06,979 --> 01:05:12,781
Luv, Kush, let us sing the praises of Rama.

582
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:19,659
Rama's great, Rama's good, Rama does what Rama should

583
01:05:19,659 --> 01:05:24,930
Rama's just, Rama's right, Rama is our guiding light

584
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:30,403
Perfect man, perfect son, Rama's loved by everyone

585
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:35,602
Always right, never wrong, we praise Rama in this song

586
01:05:57,029 --> 01:06:02,368
Rama's great, Rama's good,
Rama does what Rama should

587
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:07,807
Rama's just, Rama's right, Rama is our guiding light

588
01:06:07,807 --> 01:06:12,812
Perfect man, perfect son, Rama's loved by everyone

589
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:18,842
Always right, never wrong, we praise Rama in this song

590
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:58,691
Hello?

591
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:01,861
Please take me back! Please please please!

592
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:05,319
I'll do anything! PLEASE!

593
01:07:05,498 --> 01:07:12,505
If you had a girlfriend who was being treated really badly, by like her ex or her current boyfriend

594
01:07:12,505 --> 01:07:21,313
and she kept saying, "no, every day I'm gonna make sure I cook for him and send him a hot lunch at noon"

595
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:24,116
Aren't you going to be like, "listen, he doesn't like you or talk to you.

596
01:07:24,116 --> 01:07:27,987
"you've got to move on. Something's wrong." OK?

597
01:07:27,987 --> 01:07:33,459
Sita's doing this pooja every day... I mean, I feel, I feel...

598
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,829
Like this whole "good" and "bad" thing? That we always want people to be either all good or all bad?

599
01:07:36,829 --> 01:07:39,799
I think Sita also has her own issues. Like she didn't go back with Hanuman

600
01:07:39,799 --> 01:07:42,568
she would have saved hundreds and thousands of people from being killed

601
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:44,170
Monkeys especially.

602
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,398
Yeah, what about animal rights?

603
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:50,776
And, and then she prayed for this guy every day,

604
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:51,572
come on!

605
01:07:51,877 --> 01:07:55,047
But also at that point of time it was just that Unconditional Love

606
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:57,049
You know, for her, she was like, ok,

607
01:07:57,049 --> 01:07:58,539
"this man, he loves me."

608
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:00,586
-This is the part of the female perspective I disagree with.

609
01:08:00,586 --> 01:08:04,690
Because it's like then you can say, "oh yeah, 'cause she loves him so she did this"

610
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:06,458
you know it's like, yeah but she shouldn't love someone who doesn't treat her right.

611
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,459
-who treats you so badly.

612
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:10,129
OK? That's her mistake.

613
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:13,426
That's HENCE unconditional love.

614
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:28,280
You went away, I let you

615
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,851
We broke the ties that bind

616
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:39,258
I wanted to forget you, and leave the past behind.

617
01:08:39,258 --> 01:08:49,435
Still the magic of the night I met you seems to stay forever in my mind...

618
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:53,839
The sky was blue, and high above

619
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:58,143
the moon was new, and so was love

620
01:08:58,143 --> 01:09:01,947
This eager heart of mine was singing,

621
01:09:01,947 --> 01:09:06,907
"Lover where can you be?"

622
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:11,590
You came at last, love had its day

623
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:15,961
That day is past, you've gone away

624
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:25,199
This aching heart of mine is singing, "Lover come back to me," when

625
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:30,342
I remember every little thing you used to do

626
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:34,613
I'm so lonely

627
01:09:34,613 --> 01:09:40,052
Every road I walk along, I walked along with you

628
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:45,257
No wonder I am lonely

629
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:49,929
The sky is blue, the night is cold

630
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:55,200
the moon is new, but love is old

631
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:02,207
and while I'm waiting here, this heart of mine is singing,

632
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:07,611
"Lover come back to me."

633
01:10:29,668 --> 01:10:38,677
Sky is blue, night is cold, moon is new, but love is old

634
01:10:38,677 --> 01:10:46,385
and while I'm waiting here this heart of mine is singing

635
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:53,692
Lover come back to me!

636
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:55,091
That's all!

637
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,004
And when Ram was in the forest he heard these two boys singing,

638
01:11:05,004 --> 01:11:06,638
he didn't know who they were but he came up and he was just like,

639
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,240
"who are they, who are you?"

640
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,642
and that's when he finds out that

641
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,542
Sita's there and those are his children.

642
01:11:12,945 --> 01:11:14,646
My sons!

643
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:16,248
Father?

644
01:11:16,248 --> 01:11:20,352
Return to Ayodhya Palace to rule with me for eternity!

645
01:11:20,352 --> 01:11:24,656
But then, he wants to take Luv and Kush back,

646
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,259
but he's still hesitant about taking her back.

647
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:31,663
Sita! Well, yes, of course, Sita...

648
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:35,667
All Sita has to do is prove her purity. Again.

649
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,670
Another trial by fire, perhaps?

650
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:43,675
Or we could try trial by water. You know, see if she sinks or floats.

651
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:47,413
If she sinks, she's pure. If she floats -

652
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:51,683
No, wait, if she floats she's pure, if she sinks...

653
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:54,686
And he asks her to prove her purity one more time - I think,

654
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:57,689
actually I don't know if he asks her or whatever - but she says,

655
01:11:57,689 --> 01:12:00,692
I shall prove my purity to you.

656
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:03,695
If I have always been true to Rama,

657
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,631
if I have never thought of another man,

658
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,635
if I am completely pure in body and soul, then,

659
01:12:09,635 --> 01:12:14,595
may Mother Earth take me back into her womb!

660
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:11,630
I'm flying high, but I've got a feeling I'm falling

661
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:17,636
falling for nobody else but you

662
01:13:17,636 --> 01:13:22,641
You caught my eye, and I've got a feeling I'm falling

663
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:27,646
show me the ring and I'll jump right through.

664
01:13:27,646 --> 01:13:34,119
I used to travel single, we chanced to mingle, oh now,

665
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:38,123
now I'm a-tingle over you

666
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:44,730
Hey Mr. Parson, stand by, for I've got a feeling I'm falling

667
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:49,633
Falling for nobody else but you.

668
01:14:35,447 --> 01:14:41,053
Oh honey, oh honey, I never felt this way,

669
01:14:41,053 --> 01:14:45,202
romantically I'm up in the air

670
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:52,141
It's funny, so funny, me taking it this way

671
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:57,669
Don't know if I should, but gee it feels good!

672
01:14:57,669 --> 01:15:03,408
I'm flying high, up in the sky, but I've got a funny feeling that I'm falling

673
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:07,613
Falling for nobody else but you

674
01:15:07,613 --> 01:15:09,114
and you know it too

675
01:15:09,114 --> 01:15:14,620
You caught my eye, baby that's why, I've got a funny feeling that I'm falling

676
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:19,380
show me the ring and oh boy I'll take it from you

677
01:15:20,626 --> 01:15:26,428
I used to travel single, oh we chanced to mingle, oh now,

678
01:15:26,632 --> 01:15:30,636
now I'm a-tingle over you

679
01:15:30,636 --> 01:15:34,640
Oh Mr. Parson stand by, don't leave me now

680
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,643
I've got a feeling I'm falling and how

681
01:15:37,643 --> 01:15:45,781
Falling for nobody else but you!

682
01:15:46,652 --> 01:15:48,085
That's all!
