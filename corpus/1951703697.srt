00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,598
Wait. Shh. Here he comes.

167
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,966
RENATO:
All right. Enjoy.

168
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,879
- Is that ham?
- Actually, it's imported prosciutto...

169
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,107
...roasted red peppers
and our finest provolone.

170
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,511
Oh.

171
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,080
- What's the matter, are you allergic?
- No.

172
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,157
I can't have ham for religious reasons.

173
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:44,386
You gave up ham for Lent?
I gave up chocolate.

174
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,890
- I'm Jewish.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

175
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,262
I'm sorry. For the ham, I mean.

176
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,530
- I like it.
- I'm glad you like it, Nipp Su.

177
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,003
Don't worry about it. I'll be right back.

178
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,906
I hate to be a pain,
but can you not use the same bread?

179
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,569
The ham already touched it.

180
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,806
Don't even give it a second thought.

181
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,509
The meat will go to our pals at the pound,
the bread will feed hungry birds.

182
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,983
Okay.

183
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,452
- Sorry.
- All right.

184
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:17,318
We're supposed to go to Lucifer's, but now
you got me on a blind date with a skank.

185
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,392
She's not a skank.

186
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,432
You're gonna owe me for this one,
I swear.

187
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,263
- I think she's a nymph.
- How do you know?

188
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,098
She was wearing a toe ring.

189
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,901
Have you ever met a broad with a toe ring
that didn't like the banana?

190
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,567
- What's these broads' names?
- Alli Butterman...

191
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,146
- Butterman? A Heeb?
- Yeah, but you gotta see her.

192
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,844
Oh, my God. Listen, she dresses hot,
she knows how to goof.

193
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,783
I had her laughing her tits off.

194
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,892
She don't eat ham,
but she's not a real Jewy Jew.

195
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,618
Never been with a pork dodger before.

196
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,196
Where are we supposed to take
these broads? Shopping?

197
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,061
- Hey, I ain't going to no mall.
- Relax, all right?

198
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,932
- Yours isn't Jewish.
- Oh, why didn't you say so?

199
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,697
She's Japanese.

200
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,277
- Japanese? A Jew and a Jap?
- You need to broaden your horizons.

201
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,677
Well, now. What might
you two dagos be up to, then? Hm?

202
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,617
Why don't you take a look?

203
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,819
Too good for the parking lot, are you?

204
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,550
Typical guinea, thinking he can
use his car like a lawn chair.

205
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,492
Hey, my friend can't help it.
He's a sports nut.

206
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,460
Is he, now? Well...

207
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,830
Oh, lucky day,
a dago and a stovepipe.

208
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,099
Well, if that's not a recipe for a drug deal,
I don't know what is.

209
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,242
Who are you calling stovepipe?

210
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,068
Just give me the license, Pinocchio.

211
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,181
You little gangster! And do you mind
telling me what that white stuff is, then?

212
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,915
No, officer, look, it's guanti. All right?
That's powdered sugar.

213
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:57,528
Oh, sure it is. That's powdered sugar
like you're a dago, you lying stovepipe.

214
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,995
Why don't we call Uncle Nicky,
tell him to come to the police station?

215
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,100
Oh, Uncle Nicky, is it?

216
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:08,205
Sergeant Nicky Pollina, all right?
His wife is my Aunt Rose.

217
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,204
She made those pastries.

218

So why don't you quit with the insults,
you whiskey-faced, potato...?

219

I'll be checking with Sergeant Pollina.

00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,826
- What an asshole.
- Never mind him.

There are a lot of basketball hoops.

- What are you doing all the way over here?
- My mother's kosher.

239

If she knew I was dating a Roman Catholic,
that would be gezaldikeh zach.

00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,967
Yeah, gezaldikeh zach.

I mean, look at that right there.

Tell me that doesn't look like something
that you'd find under an elephant's foreskin.

00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,695
Now, this is the way to see a movie.

247
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,428
There's no lines,
no crowded theaters. This is great.

248
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,969
I didn't know they still have drive-ins.

249

They haven't had them
in Japan for years.

250
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,138
That's because Godzilla crushed them all.

you're Japanese, you know?

- Because I'd bust his sternum.

I think it's so cute
when Italian guys get jealous.

The hospital's sponsoring a talent show,

She's trying to get me to sing a duet

Remember when you mooned me

Well, the surgeon was Dr. Finklestein.

Oh, well, that sucks. Why him?

My mother thinks she's being slick,
but I know she made a deal with him.

She gets me to sing a duet with him

What's with all
the cloak-and-dagger bullshit?

This is all a mistake. It's a mistake.

Pop, tell her it's a mistake.

334
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,785
I had the webbing removed when you were
a kid. You used to swim in circles.

00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,424
- Leroy!
- Oh, God! Oh, God! No!

336

No, it's okay. It's okay.

And that day, it was just too much.
I mean, your mother, she can't swim.

349

She can't even drink water.

350

And the man, he couldn't swim,
and you got away from me...

351

You know what, George?
Why don't you let me tell the story?

352
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,636
Because I know the story. I can tell it.
Do you mind?

Go on.

355
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:54,642
Your father entered a contest
to name a chicken sandwich.

356
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,913
It's some Italian thing. I don't know.
He won us a trip to Italy.

357
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,887
We went, we saw everything.
We saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

358
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,495
We saw the Sistine Chapel. We saw
Italian people who tried to rip us off.

359
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,186
That's beside the point.

360
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,266
He decided we were gonna go
on a gondola ride.

361
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,630
Do you remember that, the gondola ride?

362
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,601
- I said...
- You ain't let me forgotten.

363
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:19,436
"George, I do not want to go on a gondola,
because I cannot swim. I don't like water."

364
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,600
He knows that.

365
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:25,215
On to the gondola we go.
I have a basket with you in it...

366
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,409
...your brother Dana and your father...

367
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:32,852
...who has snuck on to this gondola
a pouch of wine.

368
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:37,222
So we're going along and he's partying,
now he's having a good old time.

369
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,228
He wanna get down.
He gonna get his drunk on, see?

370
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,425
And he decides to stand up and wave
like the queen to people on either side.

371
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,297
"Yeah! How you doing?
How you doing?"

372
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,531
Loud, ugly American,
you know how they talk about us.

373
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,574
And he picked that thing up
and he starts squeezing that wine.

374
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,009
He rocking the boat. I said,
"Sit down, you're rocking the boat."

375
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,875
"Don't tell me what to do!"

376
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,212
And boom, the gondola flips over.

377
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,549
I say to your father, "Save the kids."
He says, "No, no, I wanna save you."

378
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,590
I said, "Get the kids!"
He doesn't do that.

379
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,627
He's arguing with me
as I'm going up and down in the water.

380
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,990
I said, "Save the..."

382
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,596
The next thing you know, he caught Dana,
he had me by my hair...

383
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,967
...and by the time he got around to it...

384
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,066
...the basket was gone.

385
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,404
We couldn't find you.
And we looked everywhere, we did.

386
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,048
So that's what happened?

00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,242
So that's what happened?

388
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,943
Well, that's it. And then, of course,
I saw your picture on the magazine...

389
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,818
...and it's not like I could forget
this face. I mean, this is him.

390
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,789
This is him. When he was young,
this is how hot he was.

391
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,055
That's how I knew it was you.
And I called over there...

392
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,562
...I said, "I think this is my son."

393
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,099
The man said, "No, no, no."
I said, "Oh, yes."

394
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,863
And then he finally said,
"Well, come on up here."

395
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,768
So that's how we got here, and...

396
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,533

tossed you in a dumpster?

...because you was Italian, but brothers
don't like ropes and heights.

- I've just been a giant schmuck.
- Schmuck? What's a schmuck?

Uh... Well, it means...

1028
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:12,910
...I haven't been entirely honest
with your son, or my daughter.

1029
01:18:13,086 --> 01:18:16,749
I tried to raise Alli
in a strict Jewish tradition...

1030
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:20,188
...so she would have something
to pass on to her children.

1031
01:18:21,328 --> 01:18:23,990
- There's nothing wrong with being a Jew.
- No.

1032
01:18:24,164 --> 01:18:26,758
Some of our best friends are Jews.

1033
01:18:26,933 --> 01:18:33,338
Look, I'm Jewish, that's all I know,
but the fact is, Alli is not.

1034
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:39,304
She's a Cuban refugee that floated
over here on a raft made out of coconuts.

1035
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:45,281
When my dear, sweet husband Maury died,
I vowed never to tell her.

1036
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:47,147
Your daughter loves my son...

1037
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:51,314
...and I've never seen a young woman
happier than she is.

1038
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:54,718
Do you know why she's able to love him
the way that she does?

1039
01:18:54,895 --> 01:18:57,125
- No.
- Because she learned how to love...

1040
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:59,094
...when she was a little girl.

1041
01:18:59,266 --> 01:19:03,032

for doing a good job.

she loves you. You love your daughter.

RENATO: You remember how I said
there's two kinds of people?

1048
01:19:32,065 --> 01:19:35,592
Italians and people who wish they were.

1049
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:39,466
Through all this, I've learned that everyone
shines in their own way.

1050
01:19:39,639 --> 01:19:43,439
And if you got one person in your life
who really loves you...

1051
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,771
...then consider yourself lucky.

1052

What about me, Ma?
You knew me longer.

Hey, where you going? I'm talking to you,
fatty. Sit your ass back in that seat.
