1
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:04,437
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,853
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:33,138
(window squeaking)

4
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:45,011
(razor scratching)

5
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:52,219
(nail file grinding)

6
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,231
(zipper buzzing)

7
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:30,221
(upbeat music)
(crowd talking)

8
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:41,894
- [Woman] You could do it,
get your client to come out.

9
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,010
- [Man] I'll make room.

10
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,400
- So, all is forgiven, Coco?

11
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,960
- Of course, how could I not?

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,120
- We really mustn't fight that way.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,620
- Let's promise that we don't.

14
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,251
And seal it with a dip.

15
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,900
(Ruth giggling)

16
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,520
- When a Coe scores with
them all, amazing isn't it?

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,560
- Oh, Coco, it's been ages
since I felt so alive.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,570
Who are all these people?

19
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,150
I wanna meet everyone
that's important to you.

20
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,700
- Oh, there's only you, only you.

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,050
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the big boss Mr. Brody.

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,330
Now he only appears to
be crude and cunning.

23
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,430
Deep down he is a lamb.

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,210
Wonderful party, Mr. Brody.

25
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,960
- Introduce us to your date, Kevin.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,463
- Harvey, this is Ruth, my mother.

27
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,280
- Do you think I was too much tonight?

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,160
- No.

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,770
- Oh I was, I know.

30
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,100
But I know what this world is like.

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,550
You have to stand out from
it just to be noticed.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,460
Most of those people didn't
like me, but they won't forget

33
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,146
me or you, and it's you I
don't want them to forget.

34
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,296
- Oh, don't worry
mother, I won't let them.

35
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,420
- We're a good team, aren't we?

36
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,440
- Hey, of course we are.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,380
Listen, mother bear, in a year,

38
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,683
maybe less, we'll be in L.A..

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,680
I talked to John about the disco idea

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,240
and he is falling over to get it started.

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,610
All I need is a few more
selling months like this one.

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,883
Did I tell you 5,500 in commissions?

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,330
I listed three properties just yesterday.

44
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,990
Two of them, cash only deals.

45
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,139
No one's gonna out volume me, no one.

46
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,472
(chuckling)

47
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,530
- Oh Ret.

48
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,510
Ret, darling, it's a brand
new day, Tara is saved.

49
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,783
Oh, my goodness.

50
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,339
(humming)

51
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:52,122
(Ruth giggling)

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,723
Going somewhere?

53
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,430
- Ah, did you two have fun?

54
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,640
- [Ruth] It's Jennifer, isn't it?

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,730
- Jennifer, mother,
Jennifer's in Las Vegas.

56
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,563
I have a date.

57
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,190
- At this hour?

58
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,030
- It was fine, Gordo.

59
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,190
I met Kay Lauren there.

60
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,740
I didn't know she was into real estate.

61
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,350
Her husband works for you, right?

62
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,020
- She has to sell real estate.

63
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,430
Her husband doesn't make enough money

64
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,240
in the newspaper business.

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
God, it's stifling in here.

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,230
- Yes, he did work for me.

67
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,193
He transferred to the morning paper.

68
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,920
- [Newsman] Reject the proposed orders.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,430
Another rape attempt was reported

70
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,280
in Hamblen Park earlier today.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,660
The woman managed to escape,

72
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,710
but was unable to describe her assailant.

73
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,453
- I can't bear it.

74
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,210
It's unconscionable that in
today's society the tragedy

75
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,643
of rape continues to
proliferate unchecked.

76
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,781
Why must women suffer
this terrible violation?

77
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:46,260
- Oh, the woman apparently got away, Ruth.

78
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,540
- Others haven't been so lucky.

79
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,130
Oh, I know you'd never publish
a word about rape and sully

80
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,950
the Christian image of Spokane,
but some madman is on the

81
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,480
loose out there and every
woman in South Hill knows it.

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,313
- I'm sure the police are--

83
00:04:58,313 --> 00:04:59,233
- Just drop it!

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,750
Let's just drop it.

85
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,480
Go on.

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,960
Go on to your secret date.

87
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,053
When will I ever be free of the Coe men?

88
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,770
But be here for breakfast.

89
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm making your favorite.

90
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:17,661
(car engine rumbling)

91
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,020
(light dramatic music)

92
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:50,625
- Jay.

93
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,350
Don't let them fold over,
take them right to the car.

94
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,940
- Remember when we found that lost dog

95
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,980
and kept it in your
basement for three weeks

96
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,480
before your mother
knew, when we were nine?

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,240
I wonder why I'm thinking of that now.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,890
- Kevin, you're home.

99
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,230
What a nice surprise.

100
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,750
Nice to see you too, Jay.

101
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,210
- Hi, mother, your hair looks nice.

102
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,730
- Thank you, I didn't
go to the hair dresser.

103
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,903
Did I spoil something?

104
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,270
- No, Jay was helping me take
some stuff to the cleaners.

105
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,520
- You actually think I
don't know what's going on?

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,600
You've been running over there for months.

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,280
Has that tart finally
convinced you to move in?

108
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,113
- I better get going.

109
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:28,720
- And you, you helped
bring her back to Spokane

110
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,020
and get them back together.

111
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,340
- It's what Kevin wants, Mrs. Coe.

112
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,580
- Kevin has no idea what he wants.

113
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,810
Now, would you please leave my home.

114
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,643
- Gladly.

115
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,090
- How can you do that to him?

116
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,270
Jay is my best friend.

117
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,063
- How can I do that?

118
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,500
You're pathetic.

119
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,230
Don't you even know what you've done.

120
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,810
- I'm trying to live my life.

121
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,920
- Then go live it, but
not with that bitch.

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,090
An occasional whore woulda
been a far better choice.

123
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,600
- Jennifer's in Las Vegas I just--

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,080
- Don't you dare lie to me.

125
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,610
I've seen you with her.

126
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,780
- You followed me?

127
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,663
- Yes, I followed you.

128
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,080
$400 suits, you can't afford
them, you don't have the money.

129
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,790
Your father gives it to you.

130
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,650
I know.

131
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,750
I know everything.

132
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,400
Now get the hell out of my
house and remember if you go

133
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,823
running back to that
tramp you are not my son.

134
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:27,660
(door slamming)

135
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,021
- [Dispatch] Criminal mischief at 883.

136
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:34,021
(muffled radio talking)
(Lois crying)

137
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:41,830
- Get this off me, these are dirty.

138
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,747
I can't have dirty clothes,
get them off of me.

139
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:48,946
- Okay, we'll do that.

140
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:51,500
Lois, I'm sorry to have
to put you through this,

141
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,380
but I need you to tell me everything

142
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,417
you can remember, every detail.

143
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,468
(Lois crying)

144
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,671
- Please just hold me.
- Flashlight over here.

145
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:04,671
- Hold me.
(muffled police radio)

146
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:10,130
- Before he ran off he patted
her on her bare buttocks

147
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,890
and said be more careful next time,

148
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,860
like he was giving her friendly advice.

149
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,300
I know I don't have good
visual id's, Lieutenant Donner,

150
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,430
but I do know the M.O.'s are similar,

151
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,040
I think there's a pattern here,
like maybe a serial rapist.

152
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,370
- Liz--
- And I don't wanna have

153
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,750
to tell her mother and dad

154
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,980
that manpower shortages are slowing down

155
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,160
the investigation of
their daughter's rape.

156
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,643
(knocking on door)

157
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:34,476
- [Matt] You wanted to see me?

158
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:37,970
- Uh yeah, this um,
this rape thing, it's a,

159
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,830
I agree with Liz here,
it's getting out of control

160
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,270
and I want you to help her out, Matt.

161
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,330
Liz, this is Matt Forbes.

162
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,080
He's kicked enough butt in
his day to satisfy even you,

163
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,865
and I was there in '79,
the one time he smiled.

164
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,620
- [Man] Lieutenant Adam, can
I talk to you for a second?

165
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,270
- [Ruth] I'm so glad you
could come to dinner, Kevin.

166
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,260
- You call the office 12 times a day,

167
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,310
then you start in on Jay,

168
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,150
you don't give people
much of a choice, do you?

169
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,210
- Yes, I well understand the
hardship of having to eat

170
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,060
a home cooked meal with
parents who love you.

171
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,980
- Don't start mother--

172
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,830
- I even baked your favorite pie.

173
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,400
- It's very tasty--
- I've been thinking,

174
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,930
it would be nice to have your boss,

175
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,550
Mr. Brody and his wife to dinner soon.

176
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,660
It would be good for your business.

177
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,640
- It is my business, mother,
- He really

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
- Why don't you let me--
- Shouldn't have you wasting

179
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,810
your time in residential properties.

180
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,003
The real money is in
commercial real estate.

181
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,730
I'm not even sure his
company's big enough for you.

182
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,736
- Have I told you all about Ginny?

183
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,760
- Ginny, who's Ginny?

184
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,220
- Ginny Perham.

185
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,170
The Perhams.

186
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,970
One of the oldest families in Spokane.

187
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,470
I'm sure you've heard of them.

188
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,870
I think you'd like her.

189
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,810
Maybe I'll invite her over for dinner.

190
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,660
I mean, no sense in getting involved

191
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,313
in another relationship
without your blessing, right?

192
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,360
- [Marie] Ut oh, he's back.

193
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,350
Mr. Wonderful.

194
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,430
- Well, he's nice.

195
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,330
- Who's his South Hill?

196
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,170
And what's he after a laundry manager for?

197
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,170
As if I didn't know.

198
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,930
- I was hoping you'd be on duty.

199
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,700
This laundry has a certain
attraction for pretty women.

200
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,678
- [Ginny] Hi, Kevin.

201
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:25,070
- Hi.

202
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,903
Hi, Marie.

203
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:26,980
- Hi, Kevin.

204
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,120
Goodbye, Kevin.

205
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,370
Call me later, Gin, okay?

206
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:34,320
- It's good to see you, Ginny.

207
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,220
Okay, I confess, there are
laundromats closer to my house.

208
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:39,760
How's school?

209
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,640
- It's hectic.

210
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,880
Exams are coming up.

211
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,420
- I really admire you.

212
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,940
Not a lot of people who would work

213
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,373
full time and go to school.

214
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,917
You're really something.

215
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:53,060
Oh, I've embarrassed you, I'm sorry.

216
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,250
But I meant it.

217
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:01,001
Well, my laundry is calling.

218
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,920
(romantic music)

219
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,830
There is one question you
haven't asked me, Ginny.

220
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,830
- [Ginny] Well, actually there are lots.

221
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,763
- The laundry; nightgowns, the lingerie.

222
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,793
You have noticed, right?

223
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,833
They're Jennifer's, my ex-wife's.

224
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,250
She's an alcoholic.

225
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,500
We got divorced about a year ago,

226
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,950
she tried to make it on
her own but she couldn't.

227
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,300
I felt so sorry for her, I took her back.

228
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,570
But no one can help her and I was foolish

229
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,703
to think that I could.

230
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:49,128
(Ginny giggling)

231
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:52,063
- Yeah.
(Kevin chuckling)

232
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:55,000
- Well, my real name is Fred.

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,023
Fredrick Harlen Coe, I chose Kevin.

234
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,253
- Virginia K. Perham,
it's nice to meet you.

235
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,413
Very nice.

236
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,950
And thank you for a
marvelous lunch, Mr. Coe.

237
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,410
- Ah.
- What?

238
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,570
- Oh nothing, really, I just
fell while I was jogging,

239
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,030
it's nothing really.

240
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,230
- Oh, let me see.
- No.

241
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,623
What a klutz, falling
while I'm jogging, huh?

242
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,713
Where were we?

243
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,217
I hope to see you soon.

244
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,050
- Me, too.

245
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,994
(Kevin whistling)

246
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,357
- [Tom] Kevin, you got a moment?

247
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,480
- [Kevin] For you sir, always.

248
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,170
- But not for selling houses?

249
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,020
- [Kevin] Pardon?

250
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,260
- You've been here almost a year

251
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,130
and you've done is run up office expenses.

252
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,960
Not a single sale or
single closing, nothing.

253
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,870
- I understand, Tom, this is a business,

254
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,740
you have to run it like a business.

255
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,790
But the thing is, I have finally

256
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,080
cleared away every distraction.

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,570
I'm ready to go full-steam
ahead into real estate.

258
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,550
So, I even got a new car.

259
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,140
Why?

260
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,270
For clients.

261
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,640
It's the only reason.

262
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,660
- It's not just for lack of sales.

263
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,090
You don't show up for floor time,

264
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,490
you don't answer your messages,

265
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,510
your mother calls constantly demanding

266
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,550
to know where you are.

267
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,383
I can't--

268
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:27,840
- She won't take her medication, Tom.

269
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,570
I have pleaded with her.

270
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,540
Look, I'll call her psychiatrist

271
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,810
and I'll get her back into treatment,

272
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,420
and I'll tell you what.

273
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,500
I will forgo commissions
on my next five sales.

274
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,333
Fair enough?

275
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,510
- I'm afraid I've gotta let you go.

276
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,263
- Why?

277
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,773
What did I ever do to you?

278
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,730
- [Tom] Pardon?

279
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,280
Kevin, this isn't personal.

280
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,750
- Oh, please.

281
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,390
Obviously this is some kind of vendetta.

282
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,280
Afraid I'm gonna take your
job from you, is that it?

283
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,440
- Kevin, this business just isn't for you.

284
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,580
Your mind isn't on it,

285
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
but I'm sure you'll find something else.

286
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,230
- Fine, it's cool.

287
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,190
You know, you're doing me a favor.

288
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,610
You ever heard of
commercial real estate, Tom?

289
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,730
That's what I'm into and I
was gonna bring it to you,

290
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,603
but you blew it.

291
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,304
Who knows, maybe I can
give you a job some day.

292
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:33,160
(car engine rumbling)

293
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,813
- [Tom] I need your lockbox keys.

294
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:42,677
(muffled talking)

295
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,213
- [Receptionist] Can I help you?

296
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,180
- How dare you harass our family.

297
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,830
First you vindictively fire son

298
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,900
and then you hound us
for some ridiculous key.

299
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,950
- It is a lockbox key, Mrs. Coe.

300
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,300
If he doesn't return it we'll lose

301
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,120
our multiple listing rights in Spokane,

302
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,340
to say nothing of a $1,000
fine, I need it back.

303
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,890
- Do you have any idea
who you're speaking to?

304
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,470
We are the Coe's.

305
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,170
My husband is the managing editor

306
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,390
of the Courier, we are Spokane.

307
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,260
You're nothing but a parasite, Mr. Brody,

308
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,070
trying to suck a little pocket
change from the wealthy.

309
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,430
It won't work, and as
for your precious key,

310
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,063
you'll find it at the door
when Hell freezes over.

311
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,646
(keys jingling)

312
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:46,704
(car engine rumbling)

313
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,140
(tires screeching)

314
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,423
He's an utter fool, a cipher.

315
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,650
We needn't concern ourself
with the Brody's of the world.

316
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,940
- I couldn't agree more.

317
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,640
Listen, I'll have another job by tomorrow.

318
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,100
I'm not the least bit worried.

319
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,240
I hope you're not.

320
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,780
I got to think of that
commercial property,

321
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,450
you were dead right.

322
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,060
It's a gold mine, it's just sitting there,

323
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,893
it's waiting for me.

324
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,633
I have so much I can do
with it, I can, I can...

325
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,480
- The problem dear, is
you have no character.

326
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,270
It's something I have finally faced,

327
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,690
and we must do something about it now.

328
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,860
Your car, you can't go to Gordon anymore

329
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,700
if you're unable to make the payments.

330
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,300
We will feed you, nothing
more, not another dime.

331
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,860
From this day forward,

332
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,640
you will pay your own
way in the real world.

333
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,570
I will not have my own son

334
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,453
be an embarrassment to the Coe name.

335
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:41,410
(light dramatic music)

336
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,370
Breakfast is at 7:00, dinner at 6:00.

337
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,110
I don't care where you live,

338
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,440
I don't even care about the
sluts you choose for company,

339
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,640
but you will pay your own way,

340
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,680
you will live up to your name,
and you will become a man.

341
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,730
Now, go have your little
tantrum if you must.

342
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,280
I'll see you at dinner.

343
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,583
We're having lamb, your favorite.

344
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:05,903
- You rotten bitch!

345
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,310
(upbeat music)
(muffled talking)

346
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,350
- [Man] That's hot.

347
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,487
- It's a beautiful day
here in Constad Park.

348
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:43,870
Why don't you sneak out of your offices,

349
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,232
come on down and say
hi on your lunch break.

350
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,353
(audience cheering)

351
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,607
Get a little sunshine in your life.

352
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,157
Now how about some digestive music.

353
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,830
This is Sunshine Shelly

354
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,630
on KQNT broadcasting to
you live and in color.

355
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,717
We're live and colorfully
from downtown Spokane,

356
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:29,716
the all American city.

357
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:32,900
(audience cheering)

358
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,733
- I read it.

359
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,430
- His sorted sexual desires

360
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,110
fit a pattern of other South Hill rapes.

361
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,410
Now, if the damn newspaper can
see a pattern, why can't you?

362
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,550
- Don't push me, Trent,

363
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,030
this articles gonna cause
panic, the last thing we need.

364
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,930
- 41 women have been raped,
there are probably more.

365
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,120
Bureau's still don't exchange information

366
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,600
and we need an official centralized--

367
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,100
- We have never faced
anything like this in Spokane,

368
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,523
the mechanism isn't there.

369
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,403
The mentality isn't there.

370
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,460
The captain told me the best way for women

371
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,313
to handle rape was just
lay back and enjoy it.

372
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:12,963
- He said that?

373
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:13,910
- He said that.

374
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,423
I'm doing what I can, Liz.

375
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,760
And in the meantime, try decoys.

376
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,250
Use male officers, you hear me?

377
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,390
Dressed as women.

378
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,840
Catch the bastard in the act.

379
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:27,859
(light dramatic music)

380
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:44,100
(paper crinkling)

381
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,640
(keyboard clicking)

382
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,520
- Excellent recommendation.

383
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,320
I've heard of this group.

384
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,490
They write a few letters
they wrote to the papers.

385
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,020
Real pro-Spokane organization.

386
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,660
Jay seems to think pretty
highly of you, too.

387
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,820
I think you'll fit right
in at Vista Reality.

388
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,703
Welcome aboard.

389
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,530
- I can't believe you're here Coe.

390
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,600
The old team together again.

391
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,460
- I'm here.

392
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,190
I'm on my way Willy Jay, life
has never been better, never.

393
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,320
No more foolin' around.

394
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,870
- [Jay] Well I'm glad
to hear you say that,

395
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,740
because we're not granted

396
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,610
the same latitude you had at Brody.

397
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,890
We either perform or we're outa here.

398
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,090
- I may even get married,
what do you think about that?

399
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,923
- Ginny?

400
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:43,360
It's gotten that serious?

401
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,310
- Damn right, Jaybo, in fact,

402
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,400
I may go give her the good news right now.

403
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,660
- Now?

404
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,800
We've got an open house at Newman's Lake.

405
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,760
- I'll meet you there.

406
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,960
Our first sale together.

407
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,580
- [Jay] You'll never make it on time.

408
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,413
- Speedy car.

409
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,763
- Ooh, you smell good.

410
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,389
(car tires squeaking)

411
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,361
What?
(hushes)

412
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:43,194
- Listen.

413
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:45,977
- What is it?

414
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,590
- It's Jennifer's car.

415
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,960
- You told me she wasn't here.

416
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,240
- I also told you she was
crazy, now stay there.

417
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,283
Don't make a scene.

418
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,180
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

419
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,530
- [Jennifer] I got off early.

420
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,801
It looks like you had
someone over for dinner.

421
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:09,123
I see you left all the dishes for me.

422
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:11,260
- [Kevin] Jay came by.

423
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,323
- [Jennifer] How does he rate at dinner?

424
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:14,603
- [Kevin] You look great.

425
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:15,647
- Oh thanks, thanks.

426
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,319
You know, did you leave any--

427
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,770
(crashing)
What was that?

428
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,700
Somebody's here.

429
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,953
Who the hell are you?

430
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,130
Is this your latest, Kevin?

431
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,480
Huh?

432
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,349
Don't just stand there, get
the hell out of my house.

433
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,269
- Wait, wait, hey.

434
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:32,210
Come on, come on, calm down.

435
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,280
Now, I can explain this.

436
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,960
This is, Ginny, where are you going?

437
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,999
- Get her out of my house--

438
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,332
- Now look what you've done.

439
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:44,798
- He ripped up my shirt and he
was kinda like on all fours.

440
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,180
He used, I can't say the words he said.

441
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,773
Real dirty.

442
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,663
- [Liz] Um, did he have an orgasm?

443
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,703
- Excuse me?

444
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,580
- I asked her if he'd had an
orgasm, but she wasn't sure.

445
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,990
She doesn't even know what an orgasm is.

446
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,940
She is only 14 years old
and her life is ruined,

447
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,093
and somebody's gotta stop this guy.

448
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:30,226
(dog barking)

449
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:46,422
- Ginny.

450
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,793
Ginny.

451
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,640
Please, just hear me out.

452
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,100
I didn't know Jennifer was coming over.

453
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,380
She still thinks she lives there.

454
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,083
I don't love her, Ginny.

455
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,133
I just wanna be with you.

456
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,140
I love you, Ginny.

457
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,090
- You made me feel terrible last night.

458
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,770
You lied to me, Kevin.

459
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,843
- Never, I would never lie to you.

460
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,600
- Well, I don't wanna see you again.

461
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,920
- You don't mean that.

462
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,983
You don't mean that.

463
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,870
You wouldn't throw us away.

464
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,113
I know what you feel.

465
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,050
You just look me in the eye

466
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,993
and you tell me that you don't love me.

467
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:44,343
You just tell me and I'll go.

468
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,507
Do you love me, Ginny?

469
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,113
- Yes.

470
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,713
I do.

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,343
God, Kevin, I love you.

472
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,460
- And we play among
the huge oaks that line

473
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,040
the driveway up to the main
house and in the spring,

474
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,660
oh Virginia, I can smell them to this day.

475
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,073
The magnolias in full bloom,
nothing is sweeter on Earth.

476
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,860
It was a crime the way
the Yankees ravaged us.

477
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,690
Thank the lord we were able
to recover from what they did.

478
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,620
- Mother, I don't think Ginny

479
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,790
wants to hear about the old south.

480
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,463
- Why son, it's for you.

481
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,873
Every girl wants to hear
all about her man's family.

482
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,520
Don't you love me enough to
let me share my memories?

483
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,680
Just look me in the eye and tell me

484
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,056
that you don't, and I'll stop.

485
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:02,306
(light dramatic music)

486
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,020
I'm waiting, son.

487
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:12,750
- Of course I love you, don't be silly.

488
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,100
I just didn't want you
to rehash the civil war.

489
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,970
- Are you from Spokane, Ginny?

490
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,840
- [Ginny] I was born here,
but I traveled a lot.

491
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,020
My father was in the Air Force,

492
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,790
but I wouldn't live any place else.

493
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,980
- She's studying art,
writing and philosophy.

494
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,360
I'm trying to get her into real estate,

495
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,287
she is a natural for it.

496
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,800
- Well, I admire anyone who can

497
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,050
pull herself up by her bootstraps.

498
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,530
- Oh, well you don't have
to feel sorry for me,

499
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,920
I had a wonderful childhood.

500
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,470
- Would you like some more pie?

501
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,920
- Oh, I couldn't, but it was delicious.

502
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,603
- It's son's favorite.

503
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,840
Oh, just look at you two.

504
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,940
Such a handsome couple.

505
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,750
Honestly, I was worried.

506
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,730
Kevin hasn't always brought home

507
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,533
the most suitable women, Ginny.

508
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,760
I'm proud of him though.

509
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,600
Fine new job, and you're so lovely.

510
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,643
Can I say that without
horribly embarrassing you both.

511
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,250
(Ruth giggling)

512
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,083
(Kevin chuckling)

513
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,880
- You never told me
she was from the south.

514
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,630
- Well, she isn't, not really.

515
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,763
She likes to pretend.

516
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,513
Gone With The Wind is her Bible.

517
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,063
It's harmless, though.

518
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,093
She loved you.

519
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,300
She told me.

520
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,150
Did you like her?

521
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,473
- Well, yes, I mean
she's such a character.

522
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,580
Your father seems like
a real nice man, too.

523
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,553
- Listen, Ginny, I've been thinking.

524
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,890
You shouldn't be in that house
alone and now that Jennifer

525
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,103
has moved out, why don't
you move in with me?

526
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,740
- You mean live together?

527
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,083
- Yeah, yeah, why not?

528
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,163
- Oh, I'd like that, Kevin.

529
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,513
- [Cashier] Price check
register number six,

530
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:31,669
code MI5 please.

531
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,419
- [Woman] He tried to tell me no.

532
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:37,516
Yeah, I meant to try it.

533
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:38,349
- He's back.

534
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,054
- [Cashier] Okay, here we go.

535
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:41,696
Did you bring your coupons?

536
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:42,656
Yeah?
- Yeah.

537
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,230
- [Cashier] You finally remembered.

538
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,063
- I want him this time.

539
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:46,659
- [Cashier] Okay, let
me count 'em up here.

540
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,659
- Let's go.
- All right.

541
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,630
- Hey.

542
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,403
Hey.
- Yeah?

543
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,986
What are you, what?

544
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,370
- You didn't pay for this.

545
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,380
- Oh, I completely forgot.

546
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,380
I'm sorry, I was thinking
about something else.

547
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,790
- Come on, we'll have to go inside.

548
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,814
- [Kevin] What for?

549
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,020
- For shoplifting.

550
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,430
- Shoplifting?

551
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,090
I told you, I forgot to pay.

552
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,090
- [Man] You've been seen twice before.

553
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,250
- Of course you've seen me,
I'm a regular customer here.

554
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,010
Now look, how much do I
owe you, I'd never steal.

555
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,500
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

556
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,333
- Forget it.
- Hey.

557
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,070
- You run, I'll break your legs.

558
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,330
- Are you nuts?

559
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,130
Do you know who you're messing with.

560
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,430
I will sue you blind.

561
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,430
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Go to hell.

562
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,569
(door slamming)

563
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,920
- When did this happen?

564
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,753
- Huh?

565
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,590
Oh, about three weeks ago.

566
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,650
The manager tried to frame me.

567
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,680
I simply forgot to pay.

568
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,750
The thing is though, if
I'm convicted, I'm dead.

569
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,030
I mean, who's gonna trust their
investments to a shoplifter?

570
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,940
- Well, nobody in their right mind

571
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,610
will find you guilty, just tell the judge.

572
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,443
- No, don't be naive.

573
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,760
Now these two guys, they'll
lie their heads off.

574
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,710
- Well maybe you should hire a lawyer.

575
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,960
- A lawyer?

576
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,091
Ha, I can defend myself
better than any lawyer.

577
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:20,830
I think what I need is a witness.

578
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,050
I'd like you to testify for me?

579
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,010
- You mean, like a character witness?

580
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,237
- No, something like you were
waiting out in the car for me

581
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:32,230
and I came out and I remembered
that I had forgotten to pay,

582
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,940
and then I started back and
these guys they grabbed me.

583
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,400
Like that, how does that sound?

584
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,820
- Terrible.

585
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,230
That's perjury, I can't do that.

586
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,810
- Ginny, oh you don't
think I'm guilty, do you?

587
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,240
- Well no, it was all just a mistake.

588
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,140
Just tell the judge.

589
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,653
- I need you to back me up.

590
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,750
I don't think there's any other
way that I'm gonna beat it.

591
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,123
Just back me up, okay?

592
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,303
- Forget it.

593
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,587
I won't do it, Kevin.

594
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:13,310
- I can't believe it.

595
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,470
That stupid judge didn't
buy a word of your story.

596
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,170
Did he think you would lie?

597
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,120
A person of your background?

598
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,470
How can he be that stupid?

599
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,970
- Kevin, I did lie.

600
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,803
He just saw right through it.

601
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:25,863
- It was some kind of
pay off, I'm sure of it.

602
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:27,090
I was framed.

603
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,320
I'm morally opposed to all crime.

604
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,860
I would never steal.

605
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,693
Never.

606
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:36,751
(muffled talking)

607
00:31:39,055 --> 00:31:40,750
- Kevin, please just drop it.

608
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,470
You only got three days
of community service,

609
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,290
you should be happy.

610
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,310
- Why are you turning on me like this?

611
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,310
We're living together, this is your home.

612
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,630
- My home?

613
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,820
Jennifer's stuff is all over this house

614
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,620
and I pay half the rent, remember?

615
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,060
And Kevin, you just have so many secrets.

616
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,631
Don't you trust me?

617
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,020
(Kevin chuckling)

618
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,133
Where are you going?

619
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,100
Kevin what are you doing down there?

620
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,880
- [Kevin] Don't come down here.

621
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,030
- How can you just walk
away from me like that?

622
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,360
Kevin?

623
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,380
- [Kevin] You know what I think?

624
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,440
I think you're too selfish and immature

625
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,123
for a real relationship,
that's what I think.

626
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,040
You can't even control yourself,
don't try to control me.

627
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,590
What is it, sex?

628
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,423
Is that what you're after?

629
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:30,200
- [Ginny] Oh, if I was
looking for sex Kevin,

630
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,363
I wouldn't be with you.

631
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

632
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,040
Don't go out.

633
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
Where are you going?

634
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,330
- I need to be alone.

635
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,340
- [Ginny] Well, I don't
wanna be let alone anymore.

636
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,070
I want you here.

637
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,570
- Get off my back!

638
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,920
(door slamming)

639
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,410
- You can't treat me like this, Kevin.

640
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,910
I won't be here when you get back.

641
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,680
- Who cares.

642
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I mean, who the hell cares?

643
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:07,364
(car engine rumbling)

644
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,920
(tires screeching)

645
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,500
- [Shelly] That wraps
it up for another night.

646
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,700
Gotta go home and feed my parakeet.

647
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,440
This is Sunshine Shelly saying good night,

648
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,937
until another sunny day.

649
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:22,847
(dramatic music)

650
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:08,484
(leaves rustling)

651
00:34:08,484 --> 00:34:11,317
(heavy breathing)

652
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:19,645
(Shelly screaming)

653
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,090
- She was out there an hour, naked.

654
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,250
It's 34 degrees.

655
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,600
She won't let me touch her.

656
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:34,265
(Shelly coughing)

657
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,073
- Okay.

658
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,439
It's gonna be okay.

659
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,239
I promise you, you're gonna be okay.

660
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:44,497
(Shelly gasping)

661
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:46,979
He still hasn't given
us a special rape squad.

662
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:47,812
- [Matt] Give him time, Liz.

663
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,270
- We don't have time.

664
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,830
Listen, I've been
thinking about something.

665
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,250
Why don't we do it ourselves?

666
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,790
Get volunteers, off duty
cops, work on our own time.

667
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,650
What do you think?

668
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,630
- [Matt] Well, it's a good idea.

669
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,390
- It's a great idea.

670
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,890
I'll start to make some calls.

671
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,828
- To your first sale.

672
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:06,390
(glasses clinking)
- To the first of many.

673
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,230
Vista Reality has a much broader listing

674
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,170
than Brody, including commercial property.

675
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,060
Thank you very much.

676
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,540
I have a great plan.

677
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,480
- [Ruth] Or just plan
to make a lot of money.

678
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,043
You're the only insurance policy I've got.

679
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:20,480
- Have no fear, mother dear,
and thank you for lunch.

680
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
Champagne is great.

681
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,169
- You're a good boy, aren't you?

682
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:25,269
- The best you've got.

683
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,723
- Well, maybe not that good.

684
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,053
You didn't have $8.08 that day?

685
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,790
Oh, I'm not angry.

686
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,180
I'm just surprised by how
really stupid you are.

687
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,590
And to get it erased from your record,

688
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,080
well it'll be a little
messy, but I'll do it.

689
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,913
I'll do it.

690
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,743
Now, why don't you have lunch alone.

691
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,640
Now, don't be upset.

692
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm very proud of your
new job and I like Ginny.

693
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,353
I think she'll be very good for you.

694
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:09,230
You know what the truth is, Kevin?

695
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,870
I could dump you and never see you again

696
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,470
and it wouldn't bother me a bit.

697
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:20,807
(muffled talking)

698
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:27,508
(phone ringing)

699
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,713
- [Liz] Shelly.

700
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,940
- Have you got anything?

701
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,340
Anything at all?

702
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,173
- No, not yet.

703
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,150
- I slept in my closet for the first week.

704
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,090
I'd come home, I'd take
out a butcher knife

705
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,423
and check in every square
inch of my apartment.

706
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,220
- Are you going back on the air, Shelly?

707
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,968
- Oh, I don't if I--
- I miss you, you know.

708
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,218
- I don't know.

709
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,690
Yeah, I guess so.

710
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,450
What else am I gonna do?

711
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,943
Hide from him forever?

712
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,582
David and I are getting a divorce.

713
00:37:07,582 --> 00:37:09,260
- Oh, no, Shelly why?

714
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,904
I thought he was okay?

715
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:13,571
(Shelly crying)

716
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,420
- I wanted to talk about it.

717
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,653
You know, I needed to talk
about it to get everything out,

718
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,193
but I guess...

719
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:26,426
- [Man] Here it is, captain.

720
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:29,933
- I guess the marriage
just couldn't handle it.

721
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:34,637
(Shelly bawling)

722
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:41,733
(sprinkler ticking)

723
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:57,013
(knocking)

724
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,530
- Ginny, what a nice surprise.

725
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,810
I'm afraid Kevin isn't home.

726
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,850
- [Ginny] I know.

727
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,580
- Oh, well, do come in.

728
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,723
Have you had lunch?

729
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,010
- Kevin and I had a fight
and I was just hoping

730
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,950
that you'd be able to
help me to understand it.

731
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,730
- Why even bother?

732
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,980
He doesn't deserve you, Ginny,

733
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,350
none of the Coe men are any damn good.

734
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,250
They can't provide.

735
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,720
I couldn't believe he forced
you to pay half the rent.

736
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,730
- He didn't force me, I offered.

737
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,140
- Now, you don't have to
defend him, I know what he is.

738
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,180
- You know, I'm not so
sure you do, Mrs. Coe.

739
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,960
- I'm his mother, dear.

740
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,273
Don't pretend you know
what makes him tick.

741
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,595
- I better go, I shouldn't have come.

742
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:49,428
- Hi.

743
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,880
Hi.

744
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,100
What a nice surprise.

745
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,610
My two favorite girls.

746
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,963
- You're pathetic.

747
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,300
How dare you take money from a woman.

748
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,480
You call yourself a man?

749
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,360
Are you completely spineless?

750
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,240
- What are you talking about?

751
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,010
I've never borrowed anything from her.

752
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,000
- I am so sick of your lies.

753
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
Are you using her money to pay your bills?

754
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,430
- I pay all my bills and I'll
pay you back every penny.

755
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,290
- [Ginny] Kevin, let's go.

756
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,460
- How dare you embarrass me like this.

757
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,803
I wish you'd never been.

758
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,633
- Oh, go ahead, say it mother.

759
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,490
I've heard it before.

760
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,300
Don't be bashful just 'cause Ginny's here.

761
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,720
- My God, you are rotten.

762
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,960
- Kevin, let's just get out of here.

763
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,510
- All those promises he made,

764
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,100
to take care of me, lies, all lies.

765
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,020
You were gonna make so
proud, you make me sick.

766
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,740
I'm grateful you're merely my son

767
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,640
and I never had to have you in my bed.

768
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,735
(door slamming)

769
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:01,151
(woman screaming)

770
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:06,710
(fist thudding)

771
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:23,364
- [Man] I'm sorry.

772
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,513
I'm so sorry.

773
00:40:44,604 --> 00:40:46,937
- [Man] More bags over here.

774
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,443
- How's the woman?

775
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,860
- He almost broke her neck.

776
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,170
He's getting more and more violent.

777
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,620
If we don't stop him soon
he's gonna kill somebody.

778
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,840
- I got your rape squad, officially.

779
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,180
And I've ordered them to do a complete

780
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,270
statistical study of
the rapes immediately.

781
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm sorry it took so long.

782
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,666
- Thanks Lieutenant.

783
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,748
- Hey, Liz.

784
00:41:11,748 --> 00:41:12,910
I think we made his car.

785
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,720
The custodian described
a silver gray Chevy

786
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,220
that was parked over there
about 6:30 with a warm motor,

787
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,710
gone by 7:15, the time fits.

788
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,638
- [Liz] Did he get a license number?

789
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:23,078
- He can't have everything,

790
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:25,180
but he did remember that it was in state,

791
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,640
with a clear yellow cover over it

792
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,790
to make it look personalized.

793
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,750
What kind of a jerk would want it

794
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,900
to look like he had a
personalized license?

795
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:40,232
(car door slamming)

796
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:42,732
(dog barking)

797
00:42:23,947 --> 00:42:24,780
- Kevin?

798
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,328
- [Kevin] Yeah?

799
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,161
- Where have you been all night?

800
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:29,323
I was worried about you.

801
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,690
- You shouldn't have bothered.

802
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:36,021
- [Ginny] Open the door.

803
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:39,344
(knocking on the door)

804
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:41,094
I said open the door.

805
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,983
(banging on door)

806
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:46,172
- What?
- Can I come in?

807
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:47,339
Open the door.

808
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:51,369
Kevin!

809
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:55,767
Kevin, open the door!

810
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:00,211
Kevin!

811
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,490
- [Kevin] Stop spying on me,
I'm trying to wash up in here.

812
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,192
- Kevin, open the door.

813
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:08,942
(Kevin groaning)

814
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:11,948
Kevin!

815
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:17,312
- What?

816
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,930
- [Ginny] What happened?

817
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,360
- I was jogging, a dog jumped me.

818
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,610
- [Ginny] No dog would
mark you up like that.

819
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,480
Did you get in a fight or something?

820
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,320
It looks like fingernail scratches.

821
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,210
- What, I was trying to get
away and I fell in the bushes.

822
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,203
Now don't mother me, I'm fine.

823
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,382
I have to get ready for work now, okay?

824
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:40,180
(door slamming)

825
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,250
- You know, your mother
was terrible last night.

826
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,150
She's called four or five times since.

827
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,990
I'm sorry about the
things she said to you.

828
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,683
- Don't be, I'm used to it.

829
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,570
- I found something out about you.

830
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,403
- Yeah, what?

831
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:07,923
- [Ginny] I mean, in some
ways you're a lot like her.

832
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,600
- Of course I'm like her,

833
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,593
that's the big thing that you found out?

834
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,250
- But you don't have to be.

835
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,210
I mean, she just has
such a strong influence,

836
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,110
it's the way that she wants you to be.

837
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,290
Oh, I don't know.

838
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,100
- No, you don't know.

839
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,960
So why don't you just stay out of it.

840
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,143
- No, I'm in it.

841
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,763
I love you, Kevin.

842
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,070
That's what I'm saying.

843
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,140
I don't think she does.

844
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,150
- Your mother killed herself.

845
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,650
That's how much she loved you.

846
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:54,790
- My mother was ill for a long time.

847
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,210
She just couldn't take the pain anymore.

848
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,100
She didn't do it to hurt me.

849
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,230
- I know Ruth, she gets nuts sometimes.

850
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,063
She'll get over it.

851
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:03,537
- Oh, I'm sure, but will you, you're so--

852
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:05,421
- What?

853
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:06,254
What?

854
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:08,600
You think I'm crazy, right?

855
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,942
Isn't that what this is all about?

856
00:45:09,942 --> 00:45:11,257
- No.

857
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:13,893
I just think that she's harmed you.

858
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:15,320
- Why do you care?

859
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,820
- That's the whole damn point.

860
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,443
I do care, but you lie to me.

861
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:23,350
You keep secrets, you go places,

862
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,280
you don't tell me where you're going.

863
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,763
You don't trust me.

864
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,373
Kevin, I love you.

865
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,440
You don't believe that.

866
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,760
You believe whatever it is
that your mother tells you.

867
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,593
I don't.

868
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,213
I see someone to love.

869
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,483
Someone trying to love me.

870
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,423
Aren't you?

871
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:53,679
(phone ringing)

872
00:45:56,058 --> 00:45:57,975
Don't answer it, Kevin.

873
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,930
- Hello?

874
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,130
- [Ruth] Hello, darling.

875
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,023
- Hello, mother.

876
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,640
- [Ruth] You all right, Coco?

877
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,863
You sound strange.

878
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,620
- I'm late for work, what is it?

879
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,540
- [Ruth] Don't you have just a minute?

880
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,090
Look, I'm sorry.

881
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,660
We really mustn't fight anymore.

882
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,250
Your barging in the house like that,

883
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,130
I'm afraid I lost my temper

884
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,730
and Ginny certainly didn't help things.

885
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,780
- [Kevin] Just leave her out of it.

886
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,533
- [Ruth] And then Gordon and
I had a fight and I just,

887
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,430
I just wanted to hear
your voice, that's all.

888
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,530
I'm glad you're there.

889
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,553
I love you.

890
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,993
- I have to go, goodbye.

891
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:09,906
- Kevin.

892
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:16,157
(thudding)

893
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,790
- [Man] Unlock cell
four when we get there.

894
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,190
- Hey.

895
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,510
Try to imagine it, the DMV moved quickly.

896
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,563
Here's a list of every silver
Chevy owner in Spokane.

897
00:47:27,563 --> 00:47:29,930
- It must our lucky day,
here's the FBI profile.

898
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,930
Wanna hear it?

899
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,030
- Uh, okay, I guess so.

900
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,023
Yes!

901
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,310
- A power rapist seems
to have a special hatred

902
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,290
for medium sized dark haired women.

903
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,123
Where is it?

904
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:40,956
Oh, yeah.

905
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,640
May come from a well to do family.

906
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,090
The rapist is an underachiever
who indicates that

907
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,130
he's totally dominated by
someone, possibly a parent.

908
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,150
He's emotionally undeveloped.

909
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:51,983
And, listen to this.

910
00:47:51,983 --> 00:47:55,370
Now, he's motivated by rage, not lust,

911
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,360
and his main intent is
to degrade the victim.

912
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,870
They said that subconsciously
he probably wants

913
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,490
to degrade the person who dominates him.

914
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:03,747
- And the hand down the throat?

915
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,050
- Trying to shut her up.

916
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,883
- [Liz] Her?

917
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,553
Yeah, her.

918
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,293
Well, whoever she is, she is
good looking with dark hair.

919
00:48:18,123 --> 00:48:20,360
- This is just too weird.

920
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,430
Listen to this description.

921
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,850
He had a modulated sort of loving voice

922
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,370
when he called me beautiful.

923
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,540
I mean, what kinda creep is this guy?

924
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,920
- Your problem is you
believe everything you read.

925
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,210
- What the hell have the police
been doing all this time?

926
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,810
There're vigilante gangs out there

927
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,130
following bus lines with shotguns.

928
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,270
I swear, if I had my old M-16
I'd be out there with 'em.

929
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,000
- So part of your Christian ethic?

930
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,993
Sounds terrific.

931
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,393
- [Jay] Hey, what's wrong?

932
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,680
Kevin, are you okay?

933
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,780
- Of course I'm okay.

934
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,640
- Are you sure, because lately

935
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,370
you've seemed a little uptight and weird.

936
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,460
- Don't call me weird, Jay.

937
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,253
- All right, a little moody then?

938
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,050
- You're my friend.

939
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,400
I know that, so I'm gonna
tell you what's wrong, okay?

940
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,283
Life is too short for
everything I wanna do.

941
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,290
I wish I had more time.

942
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:21,827
- What's the matter?

943
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,050
Did I do something to turn you off?

944
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,920
- I can't.

945
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,300
I can't.

946
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,300
Nothing's happening.

947
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,845
- It's okay.

948
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:36,513
- Its not okay, it's humiliating.

949
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,983
- Well, we can just lie in each
others arms and fall asleep.

950
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,653
Being together is just
the same as making love.

951
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,533
- I'm sorry.

952
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,533
I can't do anything right.

953
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,230
I try to show you how much I
love you, and look what I do.

954
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,160
My mother's right, I'm an idiot.

955
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,993
- Kevin.

956
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,710
- You don't do anything that she does.

957
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:16,903
You're not anything like she is.

958
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,143
You don't belittle me like
she does, you don't punish me.

959
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:30,943
When I, when I was a kid.

960
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,302
- Kevin.

961
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:40,703
You know, you can tell me, I love you.

962
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:47,290
- When I was a kid, and I
would put my feet on the sofa,

963
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,510
she would make me sit
absolutely still for an hour,

964
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,060
and that damn dog of hers
could jump on everything.

965
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,863
He was more important to her than I was.

966
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,100
She wanted to abort me, she told me.

967
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,650
She was right, it would've been better

968
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,690
if I had never been born.

969
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,140
- Don't say that, sweetheart.

970
00:52:14,242 --> 00:52:15,075
Come here.

971
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,170
Forget about her, forget about everything.

972
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,020
- I wish I could.

973
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,533
She was right about one thing.

974
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,353
- What?

975
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:31,314
- That you were the right girl for me.

976
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,993
You are.

977
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:38,974
I don't, I don't deserve a
girl as good as you, Ginny.

978
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,273
- It's okay.

979
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:47,578
We don't have to stay in
Spokane, we can move to L.A..

980
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,683
Oh, don't cry, baby.

981
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,633
Please don't cry.

982
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,050
It's gonna be all right.

983
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,673
(muffled talking)

984
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,513
- Morning.

985
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,150
- I think we found our guy.

986
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:17,153
Out of all the Chevrolet
owners, one lives right here.

987
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:19,880
- Right in the middle of South Hill.

988
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,163
From a well to do family.

989
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,563
So, what's wrong?

990
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,060
- Car is registered to Gordon Coe,

991
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,840
managing editor of the Courier.

992
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,930
- You gotta be kidding me.

993
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,173
- Not him, his son.

994
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,663
- Frederick Harlen Coe.

995
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,983
- No.

996
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,273
- [Matt] You ever see this guy?

997
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,730
- Yes.

998
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,354
That's him.

999
00:53:58,354 --> 00:54:02,220
I mean, his hair is different,
but, but that's him.

1000
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,806
- [Matt] You're absolutely certain?

1001
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:08,080
- Well, I'd like to see
him and hear him talk,

1002
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,633
but, but, yes I'm almost positive.

1003
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,280
- We can't pull him in
on a 13 year old photo,

1004
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,360
we need a recent one.

1005
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,760
- Didn't you say he sells real estate?

1006
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,640
- Yeah, but so what?

1007
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,240
- Don't you need to buy a house?

1008
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,290
- Judy?
- Yes.

1009
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,550
- Hi.
- Hi.

1010
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,390
- I'm Kevin Coe.

1011
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,860
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1012
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,190
- My husband and I love this neighborhood.

1013
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,703
Now, isn't there a school
up on the next block?

1014
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:41,990
- I don't know.

1015
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,900
- Oh, because I was driving by this one,

1016
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,730
I thought it to be a school
with a yard or something

1017
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:50,393
that I didn't know if it
was like a junior high.

1018
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,820
- Hello Ginny.

1019
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,200
Here, let me help you with those.

1020
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,990
Don't you just loathe shopping?

1021
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,310
- How did you get in here?

1022
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,240
- [Ruth] I know where he hides the key.

1023
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,450
Honestly, when I see how
he lives I'm appalled.

1024
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,840
There's no furniture in there.

1025
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,120
Where do your guests sit?

1026
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,940
- Mrs. Coe, I really don't appreciate you

1027
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,943
coming in to my house like this.

1028
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,750
- Now, now, it's not
your house yet, Ginny.

1029
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,710
I'm sure Gordon's still paying for it,

1030
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,810
and take that sour look off your face,

1031
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,790
I'm not gonna steal anything.

1032
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,590
Including Kevin, he's all yours.

1033
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,540
You're the best thing
that ever happened to him.

1034
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,501
I wish you luck.

1035
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:32,334
- It's me.

1036
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,468
I checked out the rents
in L.A., guess what,

1037
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:39,820
they're not as bad as we thought.

1038
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,210
- What rents?

1039
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,213
What is this?

1040
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,163
Are you going somewhere?

1041
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,583
I demand to know.

1042
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,203
Kevin, is this another one
of your skulking deceptions?

1043
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,083
- Relax, mother.

1044
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,873
You spoiled the whole surprise.

1045
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,273
The deal in L.A., the disco, it's set.

1046
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,667
We are going to L.A..

1047
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,620
Ginny and me and the.

1048
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,420
Gordo, he can visit on the holidays.

1049
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,580
- Oh, I don't believe
any of this of course.

1050
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,050
- Doesn't matter whether
you believe it or not

1051
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,760
because it's true.

1052
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,010
Ginny didn't even know
till this very moment.

1053
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,593
- Los Angeles Coco?

1054
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,323
- Not Los Angeles.

1055
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,400
Malibu.

1056
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,941
Bev Hills.
- Oh.

1057
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:34,400
(Kevin chuckling)

1058
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,960
- Okay, okay, we'll be
practical, Brentwood.

1059
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,480
A nice house, we'll rent before we buy.

1060
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,823
A warm climate.

1061
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:46,590
Us in the dirty dancing
capital of the world,

1062
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:50,532
with a disco, and the best
of all, not in Spokane.

1063
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,958
(Ruth giggling)

1064
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:53,791
- Oh, yes.

1065
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,274
- [Doctor] Take 25 milliliters.

1066
00:56:59,738 --> 00:57:00,870
- [Woman] Dr. Granville,

1067
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,973
please call the operator, Dr. Granville.

1068
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:16,263
Dr. Burrows, call 125 West.
- Hey Liz, it's Matt.

1069
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,803
Jeanie Maise.

1070
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,290
No, she can't talk, he used
an oven mitt this time.

1071
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,640
Nearly tore her throat out.

1072
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,040
Yeah, they think she'll make it.

1073
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,320
They hope.

1074
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,410
- You be on the D.A.'s desk
8:00 a.m. for a warrant.

1075
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,433
I will get ahold of Irene
Pool, show her these photos.

1076
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,900
Tomorrows the last day of freedom

1077
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,683
for this filthy son of a bitch.

1078
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:50,541
(knocking on door)

1079
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:06,260
- Are you Ginny Perham?

1080
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,340
- [Ginny] Yes.

1081
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,880
- I'm detective Liz Trent,
we have a search warrant.

1082
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,823
May we come in?

1083
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,810
- [Ginny] This is my boyfriend's house,

1084
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,100
he's not here right now.

1085
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,363
- We know where he is.

1086
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,547
I wanna talk to you.

1087
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:30,885
- [Officer] Bob you take the kitchen.

1088
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,020
- [Officer] You got it.

1089
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,522
- [Officer] You go back in the
hallway, I'll check this way.

1090
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:34,893
- [Officer] Yes, sir.

1091
00:58:34,893 --> 00:58:35,726
- [Officer] This like
the one we looking for?

1092
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:38,761
- Shall we sit down?
- Check those closets.

1093
00:58:38,761 --> 00:58:41,594
Look for any garden suites.
- Sure.

1094
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,293
- Ginny, Kevin is wanted
for first degree rape.

1095
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,113
We think he's the South Hill rapist.

1096
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,763
Several women have identified him.

1097
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,603
I'm very sorry for your sake.

1098
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:05,953
- Kevin?

1099
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:11,263
Well how?

1100
00:59:12,609 --> 00:59:13,442
I would know.

1101
00:59:13,442 --> 00:59:14,803
I mean, I would've known.

1102
00:59:16,968 --> 00:59:21,603
- Now Ginny, we need your help
to find some of these things.

1103
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:35,773
- Oh, my God.

1104
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,287
Oh, my God, Kevin.

1105
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:49,840
- [Officer] What's the
color on that parka?

1106
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,720
- I don't understand.

1107
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,360
These things were here a few days ago.

1108
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,193
- [Officer] Liz.

1109
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,373
- Are these his?

1110
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,083
- Yes.

1111
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,090
He was washing them like
last week and asked him why,

1112
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,630
but he wouldn't tell me.

1113
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,593
Is it important?

1114
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,470
- Ginny, you must've seen some things

1115
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,380
without really knowing
what you were seeing.

1116
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,143
Would you be willing to testify?

1117
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,123
- No.

1118
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,510
I couldn't do that.

1119
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,980
- I've seen this house.

1120
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,367
Pictured it in my mind.

1121
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:27,910
The the way great things are conquered,

1122
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,510
from women to wealth.

1123
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,910
But this house is rare.

1124
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:35,713
It's located a Big Sur, 1,000
feet above the Pacific Ocean.

1125
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:40,350
Made from rough hewn timbers
scavenged from ship wrecks.

1126
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,900
Glass on glass.

1127
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,293
- Frederick Harlen Coe.

1128
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,103
- I'm Kevin Coe, can I help you?

1129
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,515
- You're under arrest for
the rape of Irene Pool.

1130
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,360
- What?
- There must be some mistake.

1131
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,630
I don't even know this women.

1132
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,870
Are you guys confused?

1133
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:56,950
- No, we're not.

1134
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,240
You're the one we want.

1135
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,220
Cuff him.

1136
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,053
You have the right
- Is this some kinda joke?

1137
01:01:00,053 --> 01:01:01,190
- To remain silent.

1138
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,260
- What the hell is this?
- If you give up the right

1139
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,093
to remain silent,
- Is this a joke?

1140
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:05,150
- Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

1141
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,220
- You can't take him.
- In a court of law.

1142
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,610
- He hasn't done anything.
- You have the right to speak

1143
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,080
with an attorney and to have the attorney

1144
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:09,927
present during questioning.

1145
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,781
- Kevin, this is ridiculous.
- If you so desire and cannot

1146
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:13,003
- Want me to call Gordon?
- Afford one, an attorney

1147
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,920
will be appointed for you without charge,

1148
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,753
before questioning.

1149
01:01:15,753 --> 01:01:17,513
- This is a joke, right?
- Get him outa here.

1150
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,250
- Do you understand each
- Don't sweat it buddy.

1151
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,083
- of these rights as I
have explained them to you?

1152
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,090
- [Jay] We'll get you out.

1153
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,100
(light dramatic music)

1154
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,273
- [Liz] Number four, read please.

1155
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,900
- Don't look at my face.

1156
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,423
Do as I say or I'll kill ya.

1157
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,633
- It's him.

1158
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,463
I'm positive.

1159
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:08,161
His voice.

1160
01:02:14,824 --> 01:02:17,505
I'll never forget that.

1161
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:18,338
Never.

1162
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,503
- Thank you, Miss Pool, very much.

1163
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:35,060
(muffled talking)

1164
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,023
Hi, Shelly.

1165
01:02:40,316 --> 01:02:41,483
How you doin'?

1166
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,760
- Well, I met some nice
rape victims in the hall.

1167
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,250
It's a large group.

1168
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,320
Shall we get on with it?

1169
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:23,384
It's nothing.

1170
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:28,794
It was so dark, I never got a good look.

1171
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,403
I'm sorry.

1172
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:34,393
- It's okay.

1173
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,340
I was glad to hear you
back on the air again.

1174
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:44,433
- Well, thanks for helping me get back.

1175
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,713
I wish that I had seen him.

1176
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,440
I should have fought harder.

1177
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,423
But I was so scared.

1178
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,880
- The way we look at it,
Shelly, if you make it through

1179
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,933
a rape alive, you did the right thing.

1180
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,770
- You'd have to see the
guys face in broad daylight

1181
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:10,570
and they'd have to be
able to recognize him

1182
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,000
in the lineup cold, and even then

1183
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,416
you only get 2% convictions.

1184
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,650
- But six women have identified him.

1185
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,800
- Only six out of all those who came in.

1186
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,550
It's bad numbers for the good guys.

1187
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,580
He almost always attacked from behind

1188
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,403
and a night, he was very clever.

1189
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,960
I wonder how many didn't report.

1190
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,013
Never told anyone.

1191
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,600
Or they left town, they're
too scared, too ashamed.

1192
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,813
I wonder what those numbers are?

1193
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:38,510
- [Man] Hey Walco.

1194
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,793
- I wanna win too, Liz,

1195
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:43,433
for the brave ones as well as the timid.

1196
01:04:51,056 --> 01:04:53,806
(dramatic music)

1197
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,433
- Son.

1198
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,183
Son.

1199
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,543
I want you to look me in the eye.

1200
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,230
Kevin, I want you to look me in the eye

1201
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:32,363
and tell me you did not
rape all those women.

1202
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,223
Can you do that?

1203
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:41,490
Just look me in the eye and tell me

1204
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:44,313
and I can get you out of here.

1205
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,563
- I didn't do it.

1206
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,313
I didn't rape those women.

1207
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,139
I'm innocent.

1208
01:05:57,139 --> 01:05:57,972
- I know.

1209
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,630
I know, darling, I've
known it from the start.

1210
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,750
They were just out to
smear us, that's all.

1211
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:05,750
In a minute, Gordon.

1212
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,697
Don't you worry, Coco.

1213
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:12,903
I'll get you out.

1214
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,220
You'll be free soon.

1215
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:21,269
(dramatic music)

1216
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:30,843
I love you.

1217
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,190
- I hope you know I'm innocent.

1218
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,030
- I know.

1219
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,203
It just, it doesn't fit.

1220
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:07,450
Kevin, I hope you know that
I'll do everything I can.

1221
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:22,089
(dramatic music)

1222
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:16,970
Mr. Coe.

1223
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,580
- [Gordon] Jay.

1224
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,413
- I think we need to step

1225
01:09:19,413 --> 01:09:20,990
into your office for a moment, sir.

1226
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,327
(muffled talking)

1227
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,837
- But what does she think?
- Yeah, put that.

1228
01:09:32,196 --> 01:09:33,507
- [Man] I believe you have
been good service before.

1229
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:36,390
- Mr. Coe, Kevin's guilty and you have

1230
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:38,100
to convince him to plea bargain.

1231
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,910
- Jay, I've seen the evidence.

1232
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:40,743
He's innocent.

1233
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,490
- He asked me to dispose of some evidence.

1234
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:49,080
I had it in my hands,
Mr. Coe, in my hands.

1235
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,860
I got rid of that stuff,
but when I saw it,

1236
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,130
I knew that he did it.

1237
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,550
All the funny little episodes

1238
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,210
and all the unexplained things.

1239
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:56,760
He did it, Mr. Coe.

1240
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,223
He's the rapist.

1241
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,180
- I understand how you
might think that, Jay,

1242
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,900
but I've seen enough of the
evidence to think he's innocent.

1243
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,280
- Mr. Coe, will you please wake up.

1244
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,040
Kevin has been lying and trying to charm

1245
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,820
his way out of everything his entire life,

1246
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,740
but this time it won't work, sir.

1247
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,863
He's guilty.

1248
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,770
- He lied to you constantly.

1249
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,450
You don't owe him a damn thing.

1250
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:25,440
He preys on honest people like you.

1251
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,133
You have to testify, Ginny.

1252
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,100
- But who would believe me?

1253
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,180
I lied for him in court once already.

1254
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,270
- So?

1255
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,270
Now you have a chance to tell the truth.

1256
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:38,490
Do you really think he loved you?

1257
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:39,653
The way you love him?

1258
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:43,480
(knocking on door)

1259
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,313
I'll get it.

1260
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:53,510
What the hell are you doing here?

1261
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,700
- [Kevin] Hi Marie, I'm out on bail.

1262
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,350
- [Marie] It's illegal for you to be here.

1263
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,690
- [Kevin] No, my dad's in
the car, I'm in his custody.

1264
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,690
Is Ginny here?

1265
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,523
- I'm here.

1266
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,090
- Gordo bailed me out.

1267
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:09,923
Can you believe that?

1268
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:11,223
He sold the Cadillac.

1269
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,713
Marie, can we have a
little privacy, thank you.

1270
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:20,533
- It's all right, Marie, really.

1271
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:27,303
- I'll be in the kitchen,
call me if you need me.

1272
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,740
- Why are you here?

1273
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,317
- I had to see you.

1274
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:40,806
You didn't come to the
jail, I was going nuts.

1275
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,860
- How could you do it?

1276
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:50,370
How could you make love to me
and be out raping other women.

1277
01:11:51,243 --> 01:11:52,076
- You don't really think that I--

1278
01:11:52,076 --> 01:11:53,930
- Oh, stop it.

1279
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:57,803
Stop lying to me, to
everyone, to yourself.

1280
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,400
Women have identified you.

1281
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,550
Don't mock me by lying to me anymore.

1282
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,570
- Ginny, I'm not.

1283
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,210
I swear it.

1284
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,033
I have never raped anyone.

1285
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,960
I was even afraid of hurting
you when we made love.

1286
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,763
Now how could I rape somebody?

1287
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,923
- You have hurt me so much, Kevin.

1288
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,193
I loved you.

1289
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,540
- And I love you, I adore you.

1290
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,313
- Oh, get your hands off of me.

1291
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,260
You don't love anything.

1292
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,243
There's nothing inside of you.

1293
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:37,163
Everything was lies, everything.

1294
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:41,483
You are so pathetic you make me sick.

1295
01:12:43,438 --> 01:12:44,788
- You sound like my mother.

1296
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,173
- I'm sorry.

1297
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,913
- Ginny, I need your help.

1298
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:00,700
Jay refused to help me.

1299
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,363
Ruth is too obvious.

1300
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,210
I need you, Ginny.

1301
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,223
I need you to testify for me.

1302
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:10,883
You're the only one who
knows what I'm like.

1303
01:13:12,136 --> 01:13:15,713
You have to tell them what I'm
really like, Ginny, please.

1304
01:13:19,222 --> 01:13:20,055
Please.

1305
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,947
- [Man] Hey, Jack, get down here.

1306
01:13:27,947 --> 01:13:29,121
They're here.

1307
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:31,730
(reporters talking over each other)

1308
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:32,741
- [Man] How about a statement for a--

1309
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:33,991
- [Man] Please.

1310
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:35,957
- [Woman] Has he been naughty?

1311
01:13:35,957 --> 01:13:36,921
- [Man] Mr. And Mrs. Coe.

1312
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:38,668
- [Man] A statement for the press, please.

1313
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:41,602
- [Woman] Mrs. Coe, was Kevin guilty?

1314
01:13:41,602 --> 01:13:44,269
- Would you please give us room?

1315
01:13:47,316 --> 01:13:50,149
(muffled talking)

1316
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:06,344
- He shoved his hand a
little further down my throat

1317
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:08,173
so I really couldn't scream.

1318
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,023
He was wearing gloves.

1319
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:14,791
- [Lawyer] Can you describe these gloves?

1320
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,563
- They were dark leather.

1321
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,350
I can't be sure of the exact color.

1322
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,403
- And how do you know they were leather?

1323
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,050
- I tasted them.

1324
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,993
- Oh, what a case.
- How terrible.

1325
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,260
- Sue Ann, is the man who raped you

1326
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,073
inside this courtroom now?

1327
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:40,863
- Yes.

1328
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,193
That man over there.

1329
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:48,900
- [Lawyer] Let the record
state that the witness

1330
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,653
has identified the defendant
Frederick Harlen Coe.

1331
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:58,110
- Sue Ann, in the police lineup,

1332
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:00,447
how did you identify
the man who raped you.

1333
01:15:01,566 --> 01:15:03,790
- It was the voice mostly.

1334
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,150
- According to this
report you told officers

1335
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:08,860
that you never saw the man's face.

1336
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,713
Is that correct?

1337
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,513
- Yes.
- I have nothing further.

1338
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,210
- I just don't think rape is any big deal.

1339
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,260
I've known a lot of women who were raped,

1340
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,170
didn't bother them.

1341
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:23,160
Picked themselves up,
dusted themselves off.

1342
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,970
Very good friend of my
mine was raped twice,

1343
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,520
didn't let it ruin her life.

1344
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,760
- Well, I think the courts take

1345
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,040
a different view of it, Ruth.

1346
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,790
- Oh, I saw that Irene Pool by the way,

1347
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,070
that jogger that Kevin illegibly raped.

1348
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,450
No one's gonna believe her.

1349
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,750
Older women don't get
raped for heaven's sake.

1350
01:15:42,317 --> 01:15:45,234
(knocking on door)

1351
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,023
- Surprised?

1352
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,443
- Actually, yeah.

1353
01:15:58,030 --> 01:15:59,580
I've been following the trial.

1354
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,993
- Me too, I'm suing them all.

1355
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,800
The prosecutor, the city, Spokane P.D..

1356
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,440
We can work on the lawsuits together

1357
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,290
Willy Jay, we'll be rich.

1358
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:11,363
Rolling in it.

1359
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,660
- Sure.

1360
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,800
- I was trying to catch
the South Hill rapist.

1361
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,550
Now once they realize
that they'll understand

1362
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:21,233
why I was out there where he was.

1363
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:23,383
Ruth knew about it.

1364
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:28,160
Honestly, Jay, it would really cinch it

1365
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,693
for me if you would testify.

1366
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,820
- To what?

1367
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,820
- That we were both out there
trying to catch the creep.

1368
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,810
You'd pose as a women,
I'd follow you in the car,

1369
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,070
and we'd wait for the rapist to attack.

1370
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:45,290
Like that.

1371
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:49,630
- Kevin, my credibility
as a witness was destroyed

1372
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,660
when you asked me to get
rid of that stuff for you.

1373
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:53,300
What if they ask me about it in court?

1374
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,870
- I'm being railroaded, Jay.

1375
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:59,130
The cops talked all
those women into lying.

1376
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:01,630
Now, how am I supposed to
fight a frame like that?

1377
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:07,133
They would never doubt a
solid Christian like you.

1378
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:11,653
- Kevin, listen to me.

1379
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:16,953
If you want to get off, plead insanity.

1380
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:22,720
Try to get into one of those
sexual psychopath programs.

1381
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,270
You'll be out in a year or two.

1382
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,973
- I would never lie about my sanity.

1383
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,173
Never.

1384
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,900
You know what the problem is?

1385
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,713
You think I'm guilty, Jay.

1386
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,593
Don't you?

1387
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,660
Come on, say it to your old buddy.

1388
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,273
Come on, say it!

1389
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:52,523
- I think you are guilty, Kevin.

1390
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,413
- Miss Perham, can you tell
me what this is a picture of?

1391
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,780
- It's a photo I took last summer

1392
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,230
of Mr. Coe in his gray sweatsuit.

1393
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:19,320
- And what has happened to the sweatsuit?

1394
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,720
- It turned up missing the
day Mr. Coe was arrested.

1395
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,440
- And did Mr. Coe where anything else

1396
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,120
when he went out jogging?

1397
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,573
- Yes, a pair of heavy
black leather gloves.

1398
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:33,113
- Describe them for the
court if you will please.

1399
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,857
- Well, they became
more and more beaten up

1400
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:38,423
and I noticed a few tears.

1401
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,663
The last time I saw them they
were all scarred and torn.

1402
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:46,090
At the end, the fingers were coming off.

1403
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:54,070
- Miss Perham, would you
describe for this jury,

1404
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,620
what Mr. Coe would do preparatory

1405
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,100
to having intercourse with you?

1406
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,740
- Objection, I don't think the sex life

1407
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:03,360
at home as anything to do with this.

1408
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,160
- Subject irrelevancy.

1409
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:05,993
You may precede.

1410
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:12,610
- [Lawyer] Miss Perham, would
you describe for the jury,

1411
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:15,700
exactly what Mr. Coe would do preparatory

1412
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,263
to having intercourse with you?

1413
01:19:28,122 --> 01:19:28,955
- He...

1414
01:19:31,552 --> 01:19:33,733
He would of, most often, the nod.

1415
01:19:37,984 --> 01:19:42,040
He would.

1416
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,883
- His M.O. as a rapist was
the same as in the bedroom.

1417
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,590
I think we've got him, Matt.

1418
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,790
- [Matt] He got himself.

1419
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:52,282
- Okay, bye.

1420
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:01,839
- Ruth.

1421
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:07,940
- [Woman] Okay, great,
I need to get the file.

1422
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,710
- Didn't you tell Kevin that he was

1423
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:12,200
the best thing that ever happened to you?

1424
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,480
That he was lifting you up
into a new social strata.

1425
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,120
- I don't remember using those words.

1426
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,210
- [Karen] Isn't it true, Ginny,

1427
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:20,573
that you wanted to marry Kevin Coe?

1428
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:23,880
- Yes.

1429
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,263
- And don't you now feel
like a woman scorned?

1430
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:28,843
- No.

1431
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,130
- Nothing further.

1432
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,695
Defense calls Ruth Coe.

1433
01:20:35,695 --> 01:20:38,528
(muffled talking)

1434
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,240
- Kevin tried very hard
to catch the rapist.

1435
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,020
He felt it was his duty.

1436
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,530
The citizen review splash on rape

1437
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,820
in the bus routes inspired
us to keep on trying.

1438
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:12,160
So instead of son jogging and
me following him in the car,

1439
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,520
we followed the buses to see

1440
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,840
if a man got off when a lady did.

1441
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,590
We were hoping to identify
a potential rapist.

1442
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:22,380
- [Karen] How many times did
you follow buses with Kevin?

1443
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:26,690
- [Ruth] Oh, um, 10, 12, maybe more.

1444
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:28,340
I wish we'd been more successful.

1445
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,190
- [Karen] How would you characterize

1446
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:34,070
your sons relationship with Miss Perham.

1447
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,670
- Well, I know he felt the compassion

1448
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,000
for her that we all felt.

1449
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,900
- Objection, unresponsive.

1450
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,190
- Just describe the relationship
between Kevin and Ginny.

1451
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,100
- Yes, well, I felt--

1452
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,980
- Objection, witness is
stating her feelings.

1453
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:48,943
- Sustained.

1454
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:53,537
Mrs. Coe, please answer
the question directly.

1455
01:21:53,537 --> 01:21:54,937
- Oh, thank you, Your Honor.

1456
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,630
It was like Henry Higgins

1457
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,960
and Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady.

1458
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,370
He gave her a sense of style,

1459
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,520
improved her posture, how she dressed.

1460
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,683
He accomplished an amazing transformation.

1461
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:13,300
- Mrs. Coe, you've testified
that your son was with you

1462
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:16,240
at the times of the rapes he's accused of.

1463
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,960
- [Ruth] Yes, he was.

1464
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,800
- Do you remember that on April 14th,

1465
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,730
you told investigators that Kevin

1466
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:24,920
was with you while you went
to visit a hairdresser?

1467
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:25,960
- Yes.

1468
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,610
- [Lawyer] And do you
also remember that when

1469
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,680
the investigator checked it out,

1470
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,420
he found that Kevin was with you

1471
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,450
for only the last 15
minutes of your visits?

1472
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,500
- [Karen] Objection.

1473
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,050
- I'll withdrawal the question.

1474
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:43,970
Mrs. Coe, haven't you
covered for Kevin before?

1475
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:45,360
- If you mean would I lie--

1476
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,980
- [Lawyer] I'm asking
whether you have ever said

1477
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:50,570
your son was with you
at a time he was not.

1478
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:52,520
Yes or no.

1479
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,353
- No.

1480
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,203
I have never lied for my son.

1481
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,683
I don't have to cover for him.

1482
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,033
He has nothing to hide.

1483
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,410
- I can't believe he's gonna testify.

1484
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:11,286
- Rumor has it his
lawyers couldn't stop him.

1485
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:13,020
He's an ego wonder.

1486
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,900
- [Karen] Please tell the
court your name and address.

1487
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,220
- [Kevin] Frederick Harlen Coe.

1488
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:22,513
I live at 1418 South Tyler, Spokane 99206.

1489
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,070
- [Karen] Kevin, are you
the South Hill rapist?

1490
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,353
- [Kevin] No.

1491
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:35,093
- Kevin, each time you ate
dinner with your parents,

1492
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,020
why did you tell Ginny you went jogging?

1493
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,440
- There are great many
things I didn't tell Ginny.

1494
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,350
She's an inquisitive person, jealous,

1495
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,460
and constantly insinuating
that I was with other women.

1496
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:49,210
So I would be vague.

1497
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,860
I didn't think it was any of her business.

1498
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,160
- And were you just as vague when

1499
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,693
she asked you about
washing the oven mitts?

1500
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,210
- I've never seen oven mitts in my house.

1501
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:01,670
Maybe the police planted them?

1502
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:04,160
- And the police planted
the story with Miss Perham?

1503
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,203
- I didn't say that.

1504
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:11,160
But I would say that at least
90% of her testimony is false.

1505
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,900
- Is this the way you've
always known Ginny to be?

1506
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,100
- Ginny's a sucker for anybody
who's good at persuasion.

1507
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,653
The police may have manipulated her.

1508
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:26,860
- Mr. Coe, have you ever
been convicted of a crime?

1509
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,210
- Objection, prejudicial and irrelevant.

1510
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:30,750
- [Lawyer] It is not only
relevant Your Honor, but--

1511
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,603
- [Judge] Approach the bench.

1512
01:24:36,492 --> 01:24:39,280
(muffled whispering)

1513
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,696
- [Lawyer] Well his line of questioning

1514
01:24:40,696 --> 01:24:42,750
to consider the relevancy, all right?

1515
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:45,743
- Overruled, restate the question.

1516
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,990
- Have you ever been
convicted of a crime, Mr. Coe.

1517
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,460
- Of a misdemeanor, yes.

1518
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,610
- [Lawyer] What was it?

1519
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,697
- Third degree theft.

1520
01:24:54,697 --> 01:24:56,123
- And what did you steal?

1521
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,980
- I didn't steal anything.

1522
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:02,930
- [Lawyer] My mistake, what
were you convicted of stealing.

1523
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,433
- A steak.

1524
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,460
- [Lawyer] And after your conviction,

1525
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,620
did you write Judge Murphy,

1526
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:12,130
who presided over that trial a letter?

1527
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:14,250
- Objection, the letter is irrelevant.

1528
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,770
- [Lawyer] I will establish
relevance if council will allow.

1529
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,320
- Overruled.

1530
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,720
Continue.

1531
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,653
- Did you write Judge Murphy a letter?

1532
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,363
- Well, yes.

1533
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:28,050
- Mr. Coe, let me read to you from

1534
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:30,263
your own letter to Judge Murphy.

1535
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:37,060
I quote, Miss Ginny Perham,
a very classy young lady,

1536
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:40,380
with the upmost integrity was devastated

1537
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:43,020
that the judge would call her a liar.

1538
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,150
- She was devastated.

1539
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:48,560
- So, you think that Miss
Perham is a lady of the upmost

1540
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,713
integrity until she testifies against you?

1541
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:57,503
- Well.

1542
01:25:59,160 --> 01:25:59,993
No.

1543
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:02,943
Well, I mean, yes.

1544
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:06,870
- [Lawyer] Your witness.

1545
01:26:08,925 --> 01:26:11,916
- [Woman] I think the biggest
surprise was to find out--

1546
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,869
- [Man] It isn't fair, it isn't fair.

1547
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:14,949
- [Woman] Mrs. Coe, do you think

1548
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:16,912
they'll find your son guilty?

1549
01:26:16,912 --> 01:26:19,207
- [Man] Just a second, one shot
here, miss, please, please.

1550
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:22,328
(reporters talking over each other)

1551
01:26:22,328 --> 01:26:24,011
- [Man] Can I get a shot?

1552
01:26:24,011 --> 01:26:24,850
- [Man] Was it smart to
have your son testify?

1553
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:26,300
- [Bailiff] All rise, please.

1554
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,083
- [Man] All right.

1555
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,273
- Be seated.

1556
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,363
Madam Foreman, your verdict.

1557
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,470
Madam Foreman, you may read the verdict.

1558
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:26,320
- We, the jury, find the
defendant Frederick Harlen Coe

1559
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:32,253
on count number one, not guilty.

1560
01:27:32,253 --> 01:27:35,653
(audience groaning)

1561
01:27:35,653 --> 01:27:38,333
- [Judge] Order, order.

1562
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:40,250
Order in the court!

1563
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,173
- [Woman] I'm shocked.

1564
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:45,756
- [Judge] Continue.

1565
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:50,193
- On count number two, guilty.

1566
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:55,463
On count number three, guilty.

1567
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,270
On count number four, not guilty.

1568
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:04,653
On count number five, guilty.

1569
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,913
On count number six, guilty.

1570
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,583
- The court is signing an order,

1571
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:17,673
jailing the defendant
Frederick Harlen Coe.

1572
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,507
This court is adjourned.

1573
01:28:24,891 --> 01:28:26,531
- [Man] Well, I guess he's gonna have to.

1574
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:29,364
(muffled talking)

1575
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:44,500
(phone ringing)

1576
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,453
- Detective Trent.

1577
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,690
You've gotta be kidding me.

1578
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:51,713
She did what?

1579
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,963
I, yes, I think we can handle that.

1580
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:23,522
- [Ruth] Terry?

1581
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:25,530
- Yeah, get in.

1582
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:27,970
- [Ruth] How do I know you're not police?

1583
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:29,740
- Do I look like a cop?

1584
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,290
How do I know you're not a cop?

1585
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:39,290
You want a job done?

1586
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,793
- Actually, there're two
I would like taken out.

1587
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:46,870
One is a judge.

1588
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:50,320
A vicious cold man, a
vicious, vicious man.

1589
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,680
The prosecutor, he's the other one.

1590
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,880
I have their names and
addresses right here.

1591
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,743
How much cash are we talking about?

1592
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:02,370
- 500 up front, against 4,000.

1593
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:03,350
Is that a problem?

1594
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:06,223
- No, well, yes.

1595
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,533
I have the down payment now.

1596
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,300
The rest won't be easy,

1597
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,230
but I'll get it because it's worth it.

1598
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:16,650
- We are talking about
the same thing here?

1599
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:17,610
You want these people--

1600
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,500
Gone.
- Dead.

1601
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,643
- Dead, right.

1602
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,040
Well, if I had my druthers I'd like to see

1603
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,370
the prosecutor as an addlepated
vegetable so his family

1604
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,130
has to take care of him
for the rest of his life.

1605
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,283
Diapers and everything.

1606
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:34,850
So, dead is great, but I
think he should suffer.

1607
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:35,943
- You wanna be there?

1608
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:40,163
- Oh, I would, but I don't
want it to lead back to me.

1609
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,210
Oh, marvelous.

1610
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:44,043
Marvelous.

1611
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,563
I'm glad I met you.

1612
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,430
I love this car, by the way.

1613
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:50,298
You keep it up beautifully--

1614
01:30:50,298 --> 01:30:52,500
- [Officer] Mrs. Coe, would
you step out of the car please.

1615
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,970
You're under arrest for solicitation

1616
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:55,470
to commit first degree murder.

1617
01:31:01,743 --> 01:31:05,576
- I, I don't suppose I
have a letter from son?

1618
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:12,490
He's so loyal.

1619
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:14,470
He writes me often.

1620
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:16,183
I have a fine baby boy.

1621
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:20,220
Well, he's not really a baby anymore,

1622
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,653
but he'll always be my baby.

1623
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,143
Do you have children?

1624
01:31:26,037 --> 01:31:27,543
No, I asked you that before.

1625
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,610
Everyone should have children,

1626
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,390
it's life's grandest experience.

1627
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:35,743
To watch them grow to come
good and fine and strong.

1628
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:40,253
Someone to look after you in your old age.

1629
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,550
He was framed of course.

1630
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,300
It's unconscionable.

1631
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,510
All political, all of
it, to get my family,

1632
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:49,077
to bring down the Coe's.

1633
01:31:49,077 --> 01:31:50,320
And to what end?

1634
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,890
I'll never understand it.

1635
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:54,050
You know what Kevin and I share?

1636
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,040
It's much more than mother and son.

1637
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,460
It's closer, deeper.

1638
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:00,370
I know what he's feeling right now,

1639
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,733
and he knows what I feel, always.

1640
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:07,900
Nothing can ever come between us, nothing.

1641
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,387
No one can be closer
than a mother and a son.

1642
01:32:11,678 --> 01:32:14,428
(dramatic music)

1643
01:32:46,151 --> 01:32:49,401
(light dramatic music)

1644
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,903
