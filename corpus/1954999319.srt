1
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,081
Yes.

2
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,483
<i>I picked him up from the airport
this afternoon.</i>

3
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,766
I know.

4
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,164
You know what I need?

5
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,569
<i>Are you afraid, my friends? Of us?</i>

6
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,731
<i>Of Islam?</i>

7
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,331
<i>People are suffering
throughout the Muslim world.</i>

8
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,927
<i>In Palestine, Afghanistan, Baghdad.</i>

9
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,567
<i>But do I believe terrorism</i>

10
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,443
<i>is the justifiable consequence
of this suffering?</i>

11
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,247
<i>No.</i>

12
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,927
<i>Violence against the innocent
is not the way of Allah.</i>

13
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,204
<i>My charities are set up around the world</i>

14
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,730
<i>to stamp out poverty, as well as promote
religious tolerance and understanding.</i>

15
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,048
<i>We rely on your generous support
to continue our work.</i>

16
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,451
<i>Thank you.</i>

17
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,600
Yes, Maxi.

18
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,963
- Maxi? What have you got?
- Yeah?

19
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,686
Around 11:00 a.m. police received a report

20
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,207
about a suspicious figure
in the central train station.

21
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,406
They were sent this image
taken from a mobile phone.

22
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,689
The quality's not great
but good enough to make a match.

23
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,250
Karpov, lssa.

24
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,371
Chechen, 26.

25
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,851
Classified as an escaped militant jihadist.

26
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,809
Potentially violent.

27
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,401
Approach with caution.

28
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,521
Pull that down.

29
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,402
Security footage has him returning
to the station five times during the day.

30
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,960
- Do we know that guy?
- Not yet. Working on it.

31
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,610
Give me the hands.

32
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,561
Some sort of note?

33
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,326
Currency maybe.

34
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,361
That's our last sight of him.

35
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,489
- Who else knows he's out there?
- The cops haven't made a connection.

36
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,567
- And upstairs?
- Doesn't look like it.

37
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
If not yet they will soon.

38
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,400
Karl, Rasheed, start with the mosques,

39
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,642
homeless shelters, don't break anything.

40
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,485
Niki, try the railway station.

41
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,246
Find out who the hell
that scrawny bastard is.

42
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,561
Great.

43
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,566
Thank you.

44
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,730
Lssa Karpov.

45
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,923
A Muslim first name
and a Russian last name.

46
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,286
What does that tell us?

47
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,330
That the boy is confused.

48
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,084
And no patronymic.

49
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,608
Is he the son of nobody?

50
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,766
Lssa... Jesus no less.

51
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,528
Maybe he's the son of God
and he's come to save us.

52
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,480
Save me.

53
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,481
Coffee, black.

54
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,005
Coffee, black.

55
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
- One euro.
- Cheers.

56
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,851
Thank you.

57
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,561
Hello.

58
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,167
That scrawny bastard,
they call him the Admiral.

59
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,561
He's drinking at Silbersack Bar.

60
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,763
I think you know the place?

61
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,889
Better than I should.

62
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,247
<i>I'm looking at the receipts
from Abdullah's trip to Dubai.</i>

63
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,846
Why make a four hour layover, in Cyprus,

64
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,447
on your way back from Dubai, to Frankfurt?

65
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,928
<i>When you can fly direct?</i>

66
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,168
I don't know, Gunther. Air miles?

67
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,728
With my luck that's probably all it is.

68
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
"Seven Friends."

69
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,369
<i>- Is that all you have Günther?
- I wish.</i>

70
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,681
It's a shipping company based in Cyprus.

71
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,489
Okay, I'll check it.

72
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,050
All right. Bye-bye.

73
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
Admiral.

74
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,526
Admiral.

75
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,690
<i>Herr Dinkelmann.</i>

76
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,450
Missing persons.

77
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,285
Strange boy.

78
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,286
Nervous.

79
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,406
He asked me to find someone for him.

80
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,400
A banker.

81
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,524
And this banker,

82
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,849
did he have a name?

83
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,330
You don't want it?

84
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,401
Brue.

85
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,404
Monsieur Tommy Brue.

86
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,601
Brue.

87
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,008
Word is Mohr is on to something.

88
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,208
His boys are hitting the streets.

89
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,520
Günther?

90
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,044
They found Karpov.

91
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,606
Good.

92
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,401
Keep him walking.

93
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,328
Karpov, the Russian, he's ours.

94
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,970
Am I to understand you've found him?

95
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,645
I remind you that your license
to operate in Hamburg

96
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,366
is contingent
on your co-operation with my office.

97
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,930
I am co-operating, Dieter.

98
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,810
I want this kid to talk
to whoever he was told to talk to,

99
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,363
pray wherever he was told to pray,
sleep wherever he was told to sleep.

100
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,644
I don't want anybody else
getting close to him before we do.

101
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,846
And if this kid lets off a bomb?

102
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,129
It's in your hands, Günther.

103
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,531
Thank Christ it's not in yours
because if it was you'd fuck it up.

104
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,881
Then I want it in writing,
your signature on the letter,

105
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,843
because when the bomb goes off
in Hamburg

106
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,962
I want you there
to see the blood on the streets.

107
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,407
Have you ever seen blood on the streets?

108
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,806
Clown.

109
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,650
Melik. We have a guest.

110
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,451
This is lssa, from Chechnya.

111
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,204
That's the kind of face I make.

112
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,880
Weddings.

113
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,567
Every time I attend one, I see
another good woman going to the wall.

114
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,768
Well, what about the man?

115
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,009
The man is the wall.

116
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,531
The apartment belongs to a Leyla Oktay.

117
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,280
Turkish national, German resident.

118
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
A widow.

119
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,525
One son, Melik.

120
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,291
Michael.

121
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,284
They have a citizenship
application pending.

122
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,080
Michael.

123
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,400
<i>You've upset Dieter Mohr.</i>

124
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,801
Really?

125
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,440
It probably has something to do

126
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,285
with the terrorists you're allowing
to walk the streets of Hamburg.

127
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,962
<i>We're on a wait and see approach.</i>

128
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,166
And what are we seeing?

129
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,206
Enough to keep waiting.

130
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,522
Don't underestimate Mohr.

131
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,009
He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.

132
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,602
<i>Why don't you give him the Chechen?</i>

133
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,843
<i>Let him shine
while you stay focused on Abdullah.</i>

134
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,363
I think he's moving the money
to a shipping company.

135
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,487
<i>Are you sure?</i>

136
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,524
Not yet, but close.

137
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,884
I need more time.

138
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,203
<i>I'll do what I can, Günther,
but watch your back.</i>

139
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,648
Word is
the Americans are taking an interest.

140
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,843
Thanks for the warning.

141
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,011
Americans.

142
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,690
Günther Bachmann?

143
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,731
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,571
I know you by reputation, of course.

145
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,409
That can't be good.

146
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,647
Men with good reputations
usually aren't much use to me.

147
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,564
What about women?

148
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,129
This is my colleague lrna Frey.

149
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,607
- Hello.
- Hello.

150
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,967
She sails and spies.

151
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,090
I don't sail.

152
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,888
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.
What are you doing here?

153
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,008
Me? I am just an observer.

154
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,446
I have been observed by Americans before.

155
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,648
It usually doesn't end well.

156
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,163
From what I'm hearing, we're not
the ones you need to be worrying about.

157
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,845
Good morning, everyone.

158
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,720
<i>Herr Mohr has compiled a report.</i>

159
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,528
Our investigations confirm

160
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,687
that lssa Karpov is a member of a militant
Salafi group of Chechen jihadists.

161
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,528
Karpov was arrested soon after the capture
of the group's leader earlier this year.

162
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,331
Where did this information come from?

163
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,641
We have excellent resources
inside the Russian state security system.

164
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,241
After 24 hours of questioning,
Karpov confessed

165
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,124
to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines,
transport, infrastructure, police stations.

166
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,928
After 24 hours of Russian questioning
any one of us would admit to anything.

167
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,810
- Are you contesting this report?
- No. Yes.

168
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,086
Maybe.

169
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,330
We've not yet had the
benefit of reading it.

170
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,486
The report concludes that
the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg

171
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,249
seeking to make contact with lslamist cells
operating in the city.

172
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,846
They hide among us.

173
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,490
- Really?
- Yes.

174
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,846
Karpov is a wanted man.

175
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,287
If you have knowledge of his whereabouts,

176
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,490
you are obliged to follow due process
under the constitution.

177
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,085
You mean arresting him?

178
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,169
Lssa Karpov is indeed
seeking to make contact in Hamburg,

179
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,281
with a banker.

180
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,044
We've had no briefing on this.

181
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,321
Well, if you were doing your job,
you wouldn't need one.

182
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,601
We're not policemen.

183
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,650
We're spies.
Lssa Karpov may be of value to us.

184
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,087
All I'm asking for is more time.

185
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,763
Our unit was set up
to develop intelligence resources

186
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,360
inside Germany's Islamic community.

187
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
That's why we're here.

188
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,442
And I thought you were here
because you fucked up in Beirut

189
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,443
and your friend Michael Axelrod
had no idea...

190
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,126
This banker,
do we know what Karpov wants from him?

191
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,489
Not yet and if we move against him now,
the chances are we never will.

192
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,080
I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.

193
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,128
Maybe you should let him get on with it.

194
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,483
<i>You have 72 hours
to bring this matter to a resolution,</i>

195
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,690
if not, we will,
with or without your co-operation.

196
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,970
- OKay?
- OKay.

197
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,681
- Where should we go?
- Meet at the place on the corner?

198
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,121
Okay.

199
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,771
I'll catch up with you later.

200
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,888
Okay, we'll see you there.

201
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,881
Melik?

202
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,289
Did we have an appointment?

203
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,446
Annabel Richter, Mama.

204
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,091
Hello, Leyla. How are you?

205
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,881
Welcome to our house, Frau Annabel.
Nice to see you again.

206
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,486
- Come in. Come in please.
- Thank you.

207
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,682
The boy is good, Frau Annabel.
Do you understand?

208
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,807
If he has done something wrong,
it's because he had no...

209
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,644
Hello, lssa.

210
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,802
My name is Annabel Richter.

211
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,961
I am a lawyer.

212
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,723
I work with an organization
called Sanctuary North.

213
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,245
- Please?
- Okay.

214
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,002
Are you seeking asylum in Germany?

215
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,925
I make coffee.

216
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,882
There has to be a reason.

217
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,288
Either you cannot return
to your country of origin

218
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,085
because your life would be in danger
or you have been tortured.

219
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,527
Yes.

220
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,921
Yes what?

221
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,843
I have been tortured.

222
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,927
Forgive me, but this is my job.

223
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,842
I want to believe you,
but people make this claim all the time.

224
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,285
I have to...

225
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,290
Who did this to you?

226
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,361
<i>Roosskie.</i>

227
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,886
I cannot help you
unless you are honest with me.

228
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,971
It's only a matter of time before the
German authorities will find you.

229
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,089
It's better for your case
if you go to them first.

230
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,760
- We can make a formal...
- I will never, never go back to Russia.

231
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,881
Please?

232
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,088
You will contact this man.

233
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,484
He will help me.

234
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,004
Mr. Thomas Brue.

235
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,163
Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov,
stationed in Chechnya, 1986.

236
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,763
He was involved with organized crime.

237
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,608
Big time. Drugs for arms.
White slave traffic.

238
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,130
You name it he was in to it.

239
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,085
Karpov died two years ago.

240
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,644
- And?
- He had a son.

241
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,281
Ivan.

242
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,449
Born, 1986 in Chechnya.

243
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,690
Mother unknown.

244
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,926
Good.

245
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,370
<i>Fräulein Richter?</i>

246
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,644
Please follow me.

247
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,166
Please?

248
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,166
What exactly is Sanctuary North?

249
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,441
I'm a lawyer.

250
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,407
Our clients are people
who have left their place of birth.

251
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,047
They are effectively stateless.

252
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,765
They are often traumatized.

253
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,326
What is it you want, Miss Richter?

254
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,527
A donation?

255
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,011
I'm sorry.

256
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,289
That was insensitive.

257
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,207
I'm here on behalf of a client.

258
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,882
His name is lssa Karpov.

259
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,604
Is the name known to you?

260
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,886
Karpov?

261
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,041
No.

262
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,525
He is in possession of a letter
written by your father to his.

263
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,051
It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner,

264
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,049
as in the Spanish horses which
are born black but gradually turn white.

265
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,167
Yes.

266
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,285
This is a process I'm guessing
your bank is familiar with?

267
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,287
The letter contains a number.

268
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,451
- Does it fit?
- Does it fit what?

269
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,330
Is the number an account reference
in use at this bank?

270
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,571
I'm afraid my bank doesn't broadcast
the manner in which it does its business.

271
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,688
I'm sure that suits your clients very well.

272
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,646
But if this number does pertain
to an account held at this bank,

273
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,082
it would have been established
quite some time ago.

274
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,370
I will need to check our records.

275
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,763
Once I have done so I will call you.

276
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,921
When?

277
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,085
My client's situation in Hamburg
is extremely sensitive Mr. Brue.

278
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,640
I'm sure.

279
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,170
He trusts you.

280
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,410
As, judging by the contents of the letter,
his father trusted yours.

281
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,566
Big boy.

282
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,201
Six...

283
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,561
3448.

284
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,240
Sorry.

285
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,204
That's all right. I've given up.

286
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,162
Yeah? Good luck with that.

287
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,081
Yes?

288
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,646
Okay.

289
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,010
The Atlantic.

290
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,650
I'll be there.

291
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,648
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

292
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,771
Have something to drink?

293
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,561
Glass of wine?

294
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,810
Still water please.

295
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,689
Still water. Of course.

296
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,288
You frequent the Atlantic?

297
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,324
Not your scene?

298
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,565
You said your client's situation
was sensitive, hence the hurry.

299
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,725
I can confirm that
the reference number you supplied

300
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,202
does pertain to an account
held at Brue Frères Bank.

301
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,447
Then he intends to make a claim.

302
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,125
Then tell him to bring a large suitcase.

303
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,123
Of course he will need
to establish his identity.

304
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,447
My client entered the country
in difficult circumstances.

305
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,040
He has the letter.

306
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,724
- I will need to see it.
- Of course.

307
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,725
And in addition, he will need to
provide a certain instrument.

308
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,881
Which is?

309
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,930
I'm afraid I can't say,

310
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,688
but if your client is legitimate
he will know what I am talking about.

311
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,401
And if he has this instrument?

312
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,006
I see no difficulty in proceeding.

313
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,484
She's coming out.

314
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,681
Attractive.

315
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,205
Not my type-

316
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,444
What is your type, Günther?

317
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,602
You are, lrna. You know that.

318
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,089
Johannes-Brahms-Platz.

319
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,570
Hello, Tommy.

320
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,647
And you are?

321
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,164
My name is Bachmann.

322
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,682
I head an anti-terror unit

323
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,929
not many people know about
and even less like.

324
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,490
Let's walk.

325
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,722
Hamburg is one of
the great ports of the world, Tommy.

326
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,167
For centuries it opened its arms

327
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,483
to every foreigner
who washed up on its shores.

328
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,081
Now, since 9/11,

329
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,882
in the eyes of every dark-skinned man
we see someone who wants to kill us.

330
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,684
Problem is some of them do,

331
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,211
but the question is
whether lssa Karpov is one of them.

332
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,925
The lawyer.

333
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,640
Lawyer?

334
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,324
Annabel Richter.

335
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,846
The one you met at the hotel.
The one you'd like to fuck.

336
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,250
What? Not true?

337
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,280
You're too old for her, Tommy. We both are.

338
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,125
See her, love her, but
you'll never get her,

339
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,325
not even with all that black money
you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.

340
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,121
As far as I am aware,
Miss Richter represents

341
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,047
a client with a legitimate
financial interest with my bank.

342
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,290
Your bank does
business with the Russians, right?

343
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,966
It did. In my father's time.

344
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,041
Mafia?

345
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,204
Military mainly.

346
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,043
What's to stop me from
just walking away from this?

347
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,481
Whatever this is.

348
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,803
How about we start with
a full audit of your books?

349
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,690
But your father wasn't
just a banker, Tommy.

350
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,571
He was a laundryman.

351
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,881
- You're threatening me?
- Just sympathizing.

352
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,048
You've been left to clean up the mess.

353
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,287
We have a job to do, Tommy.

354
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,364
You're going to help me do it.

355
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,562
Do what exactly?

356
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,325
Save Annabel Richter, for a start.

357
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,931
From what?

358
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,729
From all of it.

359
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,605
I wasn't expecting you.

360
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,920
No?

361
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,923
Who were you expecting?

362
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,646
Bad day?

363
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,084
A few surprises.

364
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,768
Enjoy your scotch, Tommy.

365
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,164
And try not to fall over
on your way to bed.

366
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,042
Lssa, it is somebody for you.

367
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,810
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

368
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,208
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

369
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,081
Lssa.

370
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,560
This is Mr. Brue.

371
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,840
Morning.

372
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,880
Perhaps you could show him the letter.

373
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,169
"My dear Karpov,

374
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,684
"as discussed please accept this letter
as assurance from one friend to another,

375
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,849
"that in the unfortunate
circumstance of your death

376
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,484
"I should be pleased to acquaint your own
dear son, Ivan Grigorevich Karpov,

377
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,604
"with our friend Mr. Lipizzaner.

378
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,967
"He need only present this letter,
together with the necessary instrument

379
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,890
<i>"currently in your
possession for me to act.</i>

380
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,162
<i>"In case of my own death, my son Thomas
will fulfill my promise to you."</i>

381
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,046
Forgive me.
It's correct signature of your father?

382
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,281
It is.

383
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,767
Should I address you then as lssa or Ivan?

384
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,480
Lssa.

385
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,211
It's my Muslim name and I like.

386
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,247
But not the one your father gave you?

387
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,769
My mother was Chechen.

388
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,969
I wish, sir, with your help,
to make an honorable life in Hamburg.

389
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,964
Very good,

390
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,250
but first, you understand
there are certain questions of fact.

391
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,082
I bring your attention
to the matter of the instrument.

392
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,006
May I ask how
you came to be in possession of this?

393
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,808
It was given to me by my father's lawyer.

394
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,484
So it seems I am being asked

395
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,487
to fulfill one father's promise to another.

396
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,927
It's true. Karpov was my father.

397
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,724
You weren't close?

398
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,522
My father was a murderer.

399
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,889
He has Chechen blood on his hands.

400
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,084
And yet you seem willing enough
to take his money?

401
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,204
I understand you came here from Turkey,

402
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,044
by an informal route, shall we say?

403
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,567
May I ask, what you were doing in Turkey?

404
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,330
I was in prison.

405
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,010
And before that?

406
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,529
I was in prison in Russia.

407
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,643
- Why?
- You don't need to answer that, lssa.

408
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,371
- Why not?
- Because it is immaterial.

409
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
To what, Fräulein Richter?

410
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,121
Your client...

411
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,884
He's your client, too, Mr. Brue.

412
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,442
Your client lays claim
to his father's account,

413
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,411
yet he has no passport,
cannot prove his identity.

414
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,570
He has the key and the letter,
what more do you want?

415
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,123
We couldn't hear everything
so well, Tommy.

416
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,003
So exactly how much are we talking about?

417
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,484
I can't tell you.

418
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,641
Not exactly.

419
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,563
A ballpark figure?

420
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,284
10,000, 100,000, 500,000?

421
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,408
We're talking

422
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,087
upwards of 10 million Euro.

423
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,406
At least.

424
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,727
- Coffee.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,086
- Black.
- Right away.

426
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,769
I wasn't sure you'd come.

427
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,604
I want to make one thing clear.

428
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,120
I don't owe you anything.

429
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,728
What happened in Beirut?

430
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,042
You know what happened in Beirut.

431
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,043
My networks were blown.

432
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,288
So Hamburg is a punishment?

433
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,165
Depends on whether you like Hamburg.

434
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,681
Unless that's
what you want people to think?

435
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,683
Take some of the heat off you
so you can get on with the real game.

436
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,006
Which is?

437
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,004
Dr. Faisal Abdullah.

438
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,285
Come on, Günther, we probably know
as much about him as you do.

439
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,162
What do you know, Martha?

440
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,364
We know you've been
watching him for months,

441
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,125
and we know
you're under pressure to get results.

442
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,604
And we know that the man moves money
through a network of Muslim charities

443
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,650
and every time he does,
some of it goes missing.

444
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,807
Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything
we want him to be and a little bit more.

445
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,043
He's tolerant, enlightened,
engaged with the West.

446
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,362
But every good man has a little bit of bad,
doesn't he?

447
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,803
And in Abdullah's case, that little bit

448
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,886
just might kill you.

449
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,924
You know all that, how come
he's still walking the streets of Hamburg

450
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,606
and not rotting
in some cell in Guantánamo?

451
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,567
Because we think, we don't know.

452
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,246
The money leaves
and we don't know where it goes.

453
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,801
Anyways, on German soil
he's got the protection of German law.

454
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,287
That hasn't stopped you before.

455
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,044
We don't do that anymore.

456
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,890
You want us to do it, then.

457
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,640
I'm more interested in knowing why
you haven't done it already?

458
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,002
Please work with us on this one, Günther.

459
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,410
I don't trust you.

460
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,929
Old habits die hard.

461
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,921
That's what I'm worried about.

462
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,728
I was talking about yours.

463
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,882
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

464
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,970
I got your text.

465
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,887
L.-

466
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,802
I can't do this anymore.

467
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,731
Someone's going to find out. I can feel it.

468
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,885
I'm frightened.

469
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,764
They are looking at me.

470
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,285
All of them.

471
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,084
I'm done. It's over.

472
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,011
I am not your spy. I am a student.

473
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,604
You cannot make me do this.

474
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,246
I never made you do anything, Jamal.

475
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,689
And I never will.

476
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,925
You know that.

477
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,684
When we first met,

478
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,882
you remember what we talked about?

479
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,684
You remember that?

480
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,561
Family, the future.

481
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,689
Most of us don't get to
choose, but you did.

482
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,162
You made the right choice.

483
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,245
It's not easy.

484
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,968
But there's no going back,

485
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,810
for any of us.

486
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,722
We can't undo what's done.

487
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,211
Look at me.

488
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,570
Look at me.

489
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,971
Come here.

490
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,683
You're my ears, Jamal, and my eyes.
I need you.

491
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,609
You're important to me.

492
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,406
Good.

493
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,765
<i>- Hello?
- Tom my?</i>

494
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,047
<i>Yes.</i>

495
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,530
You need to give lssa Karpov what he wants.

496
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,290
Miss Richter?

497
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,565
Can we talk?

498
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,291
Perhaps we could go for a tea?

499
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,244
What do you want?

500
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,160
I've reconsidered your client's position.

501
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,204
My bank is prepared to honor his claim.

502
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,248
Why have you changed your mind?

503
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,368
Perhaps you convinced me.

504
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,085
I thought you'd be pleased.

505
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,641
Okay.

506
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,087
I'll be in touch.

507
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,920
Annabel?

508
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,049
We should take care.

509
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,286
All of us.

510
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,691
<i>It is our religious obligation to give.</i>

511
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,806
<i>This is the holy practice of Zakat,
one of the five pillars of Islam.</i>

512
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,849
<i>Through our adherence to
this practice of charity,</i>

513
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,888
<i>we are drawn nearer to God.</i>

514
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,689
Günther, the banker called. He did it.

515
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,521
Good.

516
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,925
Lssa! lssa!

517
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,845
Wake up.

518
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,930
Where will you take him?

519
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,807
It's better if you don't know.

520
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,801
We have to go.

521
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,488
It's not safe to stay here.
For you or for them.

522
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,642
There are clothes in here.

523
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,002
There's also some scissors and a razor.

524
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,804
Lssa, they know what you look like.

525
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,520
Come on, lssa.

526
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,447
They're moving.

527
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,649
Where are we going?

528
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,561
My brother Florien has
an apartment that's being renovated.

529
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,405
He's arranged
for them to stop work for a week.

530
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,082
Where's the next station?

531
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,681
Okay.

532
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,690
We get out at the next stop.

533
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,011
We have to find another taxi, okay?

534
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,447
Hey-

535
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,284
You're blocking the street!

536
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,966
Hey-

537
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,881
Fuck!

538
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,361
Hello?

539
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,127
Hello?

540
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,364
Against the wall!

541
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,805
Check the other rooms!

542
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,927
Stop!

543
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,161
Bedroom clear.

544
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,161
We're nearly there.

545
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,604
I wish to talk to Mr. Brue.

546
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,562
I spoke with him earlier tonight.

547
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,001
Lssa, he says the bank
will honor your claim.

548
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,048
I do not want the money.

549
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,846
What?

550
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,204
Father's money is bad money.

551
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,564
But without it you have nothing.

552
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,601
I have God.

553
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,563
I brought you some food.

554
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,050
There's a sleeping bag
and some more clothes.

555
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,009
I'll be back first thing in the morning.

556
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,409
It is not a prison.

557
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,640
This was the best you could do, huh?

558
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,165
I am a cave dweller.

559
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,527
I'll leave the rooms with a view to you.

560
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,888
You let Mohr off the leash?

561
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,367
He doesn't need me
to give him a reason to piss you off.

562
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,241
You've lost Karpov, haven't you?

563
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,127
I need the lawyer to move freely.

564
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,083
I don't have that kind
of influence, Günther.

565
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,767
We both know you have
all the influence you choose to have.

566
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,003
Look, if you want me to help you on
your way, you've got to tell me.

567
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,730
Tell me which way you're heading.

568
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,166
Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.

569
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,804
It was carrying 1,000 tons of donated grain
bound for Djibouti.

570
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,810
It stopped to re-fuel
on the south coast of Yemen.

571
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,161
When it reached its destination
there were 900 tons left.

572
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,401
At the same time 100 tons of grain

573
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,322
mysteriously hit the open market
in the Yemen.

574
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,449
The money from its sale was used
to buy rocket launchers

575
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,409
for lslamist militants.

576
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,290
I think the shipping company
is an al-Qaeda front.

577
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,968
I think that's where the missing funds
from Abdullah's charities are going.

578
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,123
You think, or you know?

579
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,122
Come on, Günther. Share.

580
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,282
Abdullah's not the bad guy.

581
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,448
He's our way to the bad guy.

582
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,568
A man supplies money
that buys weapons that kills Americans

583
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,011
and you're telling me he's a pal?

584
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,209
So maybe he's not waving the flag
of freedom and democracy

585
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,805
as enthusiastically as you'd like.

586
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,961
Okay.

587
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,765
- But he sees his people...
- Spare the lecture.

588
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,571
He sees his people being fucked over
from here to eternity.

589
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,687
I've heard that before, so...

590
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,402
Maybe a little bit of him
wants to return the favor,

591
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,202
but it's that little bit
that makes him so valuable.

592
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,561
Don't you see?

593
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,688
Okay. I understand.
But that's not what my people would say.

594
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,843
What would your people say?
Take him out? Kill him?

595
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,530
And then what have you got?

596
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,002
A great big fucking hole,
and who's going to fill it?

597
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,407
Nobody knows. You least of all.

598
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,801
So we all start looking again,
and tap, tapping around in the dark.

599
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,849
You want to own Abdullah,
is that what you want?

600
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,924
A man with your reputation
and your resources.

601
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,281
How are you going to do that?

602
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,531
Karpov has access to money.

603
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,409
That may be of interest to Abdullah.

604
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,530
And the lawyer?

605
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,125
He trusts her.

606
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,331
It's okay.

607
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,925
It's okay?

608
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,966
Dance.

609
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,327
- Trying to impress me Günther?
- No.

610
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,290
Listen, I'll put Mohr back on the leash,

611
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,089
but now you owe me.

612
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,405
Hey, Annabel.

613
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,807
Good to see you. How's Ursula?

614
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,680
No, no.

615
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,040
Let go. Let go of me!

616
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,407
Yes?

617
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,921
Okay?

618
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,684
- Yeah. Good.
- Yeah.

619
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,286
Rasheed?

620
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,683
You can't do this. I'm a lawyer.

621
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,366
- This is criminal.
- Sit the fuck down.

622
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,601
Lawyer?

623
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,807
You're a fucking social
worker for terrorists.

624
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,685
Cigarette?

625
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,401
That's right, you've given up.

626
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,805
Is that it?

627
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,603
Is that all the fight
you're going to give me?

628
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,246
Pacifist.

629
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,564
We know about you.

630
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,010
Left-wing lawyer.

631
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,890
Wealthy family.

632
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,930
Father's a judge.

633
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,484
Everything you do says "fuck you" to him.

634
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,162
Is that the best you can do?

635
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,885
Can I go now?

636
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,680
Go where?

637
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,520
Go where?

638
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,922
Back to your self-righteous friends
at Sanctuary North?

639
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,688
But no one's going to saw off their heads,
are they?

640
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,087
Nobody's going to blow up their kids

641
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,128
because you're on a beach in Bali

642
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,329
or riding a train to school
in Madrid or London.

643
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,843
How fucking dare you?

644
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,206
How fucking dare me?

645
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,727
Tell me I've broken every rule in the book?

646
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,364
That I've trampled
on the essence of the constitution?

647
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,008
You want to spout that crap?

648
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,521
Yes?

649
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,402
Do you know where you are?

650
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,651
No, you don't.

651
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,087
This is the real world, Annabel.

652
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,924
We are fighting against the radical
off cuts of a nation called Islam.

653
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,410
You've crossed the line.

654
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,522
You're on their side now.

655
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,681
Hello.

656
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,484
I don't care what you do to me.

657
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,124
But you're not the one we're talking about,
are you, dear?

658
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,448
Lssa must be worried sick.

659
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,842
Wherever you've hidden him,

660
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,168
he's probably wondering
if you're ever coming back.

661
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,166
I hope he doesn't do anything foolish.

662
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,250
Come, sit with me.

663
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,960
Come on.

664
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,529
<i>There are people out there
who want to arrest him.</i>

665
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,928
<i>You know that of course.</i>

666
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,728
<i>We're concerned
that they will find him before we do.</i>

667
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,404
There is a difference between them and us.

668
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,523
They want to hurt him.

669
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,124
We want to help him.

670
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,410
You see, Annabel, we're not your enemy.

671
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,244
We're your solution.

672
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,961
Good.

673
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,647
You know what my guys told me?

674
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,686
When they pulled you off the street?

675
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,602
You didn't put up a fight.

676
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,205
Not really.

677
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,290
You struggled a bit. Screamed a little, but

678
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,169
you let them take you.

679
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,283
It's almost as if you wanted it to happen.

680
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,681
You needed someone
to take it out of your hands

681
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,684
because you are out of your depth, Annabel.

682
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,644
You know you can't save him,

683
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,324
not on your own.

684
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,322
Your choice is between us

685
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,085
and nobody.

686
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,289
The clock is ticking.

687
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,604
You know they'll find him,
and when they do,

688
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,446
he'll be on the first plane back to Russia,

689
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,682
unless the Americans want him

690
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,563
and then we won't know where he is
and nor will he.

691
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,128
He doesn't want the money.

692
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,848
He just doesn't want it.

693
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,690
Half radical, half

694
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,480
rich kid.

695
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,166
Half Russian, half Chechen.

696
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,006
Loves his mother, hates his father.

697
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,605
You and I both know
lssa Karpov has no idea what he wants.

698
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,047
There is something else
you and I both know, don't we?

699
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,001
We both know he's innocent.

700
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,569
So what do you want?

701
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,929
I want to help him.

702
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,081
Lssa?

703
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,204
Lssa, I'm sorry.

704
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,770
I had a dream.

705
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,366
They took you. They tortured you.

706
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,966
And what happened?

707
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,044
Did I tell them where you were?

708
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,727
No.

709
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,048
You are stronger than I was.

710
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,009
You tell them nothing.

711
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,481
Go and put on something warm.

712
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,722
I want to show you something outside.

713
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,486
Okay.

714
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,241
Right.

715
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,365
Look at him.

716
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,525
He's safe.

717
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,002
There's a bed for you here.

718
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,328
It's better that you don't go home.

719
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,528
<i>Herr Mohr and his boys
are still out looking for you.</i>

720
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,207
Are you trying to get me drunk?

721
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,761
Yes.

722
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,889
How's Karpov?

723
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,925
Getting there.

724
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,485
And the lawyer?

725
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,285
I already got you all the time I can get.

726
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,211
Beirut was our mistake.

727
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,690
One of our agents

728
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,287
blew your network and I know you shared.
We messed up.

729
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,931
Just thought you needed to know that.

730
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,767
We make that kind of mistake.

731
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,651
I can understand why you don't trust us.

732
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,089
Your agents and contacts
were compromised.

733
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,688
Men who trusted you died,

734
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,047
and that stays with you always.

735
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,089
And all that damage

736
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,204
we leave behind.

737
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,770
All those lives,

738
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,929
all those empty rooms,

739
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,361
what would they have been for?

740
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,686
You ever ask yourself that question?

741
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,251
Why we do what we do?

742
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,802
Sometimes.
But I always come back to the same answer.

743
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,405
And what is it?

744
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,167
Make the world a safer place.

745
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,961
Isn't that enough?

746
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,007
Move your queen.

747
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,447
Just because you're Russian, doesn't mean
you're a better chess player than me.

748
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,525
I'm Chechen.

749
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,921
Okay, so you're good at chess.

750
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,811
Tell me something else about yourself.

751
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,681
You said your mother is Chechen?

752
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,801
She's dead.

753
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,085
I'm sorry.

754
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,124
My father raped her.

755
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,282
She died when I was born.

756
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,285
She was 15.

757
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,565
It was my mother's.

758
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,050
It's beautiful.

759
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,691
<i>You must go.</i>

760
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,645
You can push him a bit more.

761
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,162
Try to get him emotional.

762
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,844
If it happens naturally, lose your temper.

763
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,522
But he doesn't want the money.

764
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,846
I know.

765
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,490
But he wants you.

766
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,640
Günther?

767
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,610
You should take care.

768
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,921
Maybe we're pushing too hard.

769
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,488
Don't go soft on me, lrna.

770
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,843
There's no room for that on this one.

771
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,642
Tell me one where there was.

772
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,240
Morning.

773
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:28,727
Seventy people died in a market
in Baghdad yesterday.

774
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,525
God's will?

775
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,642
<i>Or just a man who was arrogant enough
to kill in his name?</i>

776
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:53,846
She's good.

777
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,400
Leyla and Melik have been arrested.

778
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,361
They may be deported,

779
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,286
because they were kind to you,
because they invited you in to their home.

780
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,128
<i>Explain it to me, lssa!</i>

781
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,611
<i>God's will?</i>

782
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:15,205
<i>Explain to me why that man who killed
those women and children in Baghdad</i>

783
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,163
<i>is any different from your own father?</i>

784
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,930
<i>I came to Hamburg to make a new life.</i>

785
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,686
<i>No. You came to Hamburg
to find Mr. Tommy Brue.</i>

786
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,524
<i>You came to claim your father's money.</i>

787
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,490
<i>I told you, I do not want his money.</i>

788
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,125
Forgive me.

789
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,881
Maybe

790
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:06,407
there's a way
to leave your past behind, lssa.

791
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,647
<i>Take your father's money...</i>

792
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,121
Take your father's money,
and turn it in to something good.

793
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,680
<i>And turn it in to something good.</i>

794
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,723
Your goat is tethered.

795
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,282
It's just an ordinary pen.

796
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:30,161
Looks like a pen, writes like a pen
and listens like a pen.

797
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,127
Take it apart, it's still a pen.

798
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,850
Are you clear?

799
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,925
Are you clear?

800
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,526
You are acting on behalf
of a wealthy Muslim client.

801
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,601
We've been over this.

802
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,045
You are acting on behalf
of a wealthy Muslim...

803
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,201
Several times.

804
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,203
Who has come in to
a considerable inheritance

805
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,521
and the source of the money
is questionable.

806
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,967
He seeks to distribute these funds
in a spiritually correct manner.

807
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,724
For Christ's sake!

808
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,646
I'm not doing this for you.

809
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,489
Whatever it takes, Tommy.

810
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,721
Hello.

811
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,126
Put your arms up.

812
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,047
Bag?

813
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,887
Hi.

814
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,201
- Hi.
- Hello.

815
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,321
- Mr. Brue?
- Yes.

816
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,481
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

817
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,527
I'm Jamal.

818
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,965
My father is expecting you.

819
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,724
- Can you take off your shoes?
- Of course.

820
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,564
I'll take care of the coat.

821
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,325
Mr. Brue.

822
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,129
- Mr. Brue.
- An honor.

823
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,171
You have met my son Jamal?

824
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,130
Yes, and another at the door, I believe.

825
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,691
Please sit.

826
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,126
Please.

827
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,010
As explained to you,

828
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,243
my client's situation
in Germany is delicate.

829
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,800
These are the details of his offer.

830
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,722
As you can see, there are specific requests
for some money to be sent to Chechnya.

831
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,121
Hospitals and schools.

832
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,682
Perhaps this is a joke?

833
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,167
You have added a zero to test me.

834
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,929
The figure is correct.

835
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,726
Where did this money come from?

836
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,283
It has come to him
in the form of an inheritance.

837
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,211
My client has come to regard it as unclean

838
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:06,968
and seeks your guidance in disposing of it
in a manner befitting your religion.

839
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,531
You're an honorable man, I believe that.

840
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,769
<i>But tell me, why should I trust you?</i>

841
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,727
<i>We must trust each other surely.</i>

842
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,168
I am willing, under my
client's instruction,

843
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,801
to arrange for significant funds
to be transferred to you.

844
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,091
You are known as a religious man.

845
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,844
A trusted man.

846
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,527
I accept you will direct this money

847
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,443
to the purpose he intends.

848
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,401
Why this urgency?

849
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:46,001
My client's legal status in Germany
is insecure.

850
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,650
I would recommend
you accept this gift now,

851
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,805
because he may not be
in a position to offer it much longer.

852
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,685
<i>Mr. Brue.</i>

853
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,606
- Here.
- Thanks.

854
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:27,002
Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce
your benefactor, lssa Karpov,

855
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:30,084
and his lawyer, Miss Richter.

856
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,762
I wish to speak with lssa alone.

857
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,171
Of course.

858
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,085
Miss Richter?

859
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,326
<i>Please tell me,</i>

860
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,323
why you have decided
to make this generous gift?

861
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,249
Are you under duress?

862
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,001
No.

863
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,411
Look at me.

864
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,687
It is unclean money, sir.

865
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,324
It belongs to a man who
has done great evil.

866
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,011
My father.

867
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,242
I wish to be free of him.

868
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,607
Whose sins do you renounce
by making this gift?

869
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,682
The sins of my father.

870
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,204
And your own sins?

871
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,482
I believe you feel lost,

872
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,129
without God or love.

873
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,366
You must choose the path of Allah.

874
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:45,205
Only then
will you be truly free of this burden.

875
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,328
I am satisfied, Mr. Brue,
that his offer is genuine.

876
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,731
Wonderful.

877
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,521
This is a list of charities,
with their banking details,

878
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,840
for your verification.

879
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:16,960
Please.

880
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,930
It seems in order.

881
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,760
I will await further instruction.

882
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,680
Michael.

883
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,444
Welcome to Berlin.

884
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,601
Everyone got my report?

885
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,881
Yes.

886
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,686
You need to concentrate on
Burgdorf, Ministry of the Interior.

887
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,608
The final decision will be his.

888
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:19,810
I'm going to need passports
for Karpov and the Turks.

889
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,211
We don't do passports.

890
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,566
He gave the lawyer his word.

891
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:26,281
I did, and this time
I want it to mean something.

892
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:54,810
It's up there.

893
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,764
We've checked
every name on the charity list.

894
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,524
They're all clean.

895
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,883
<i>Herr Bachmann, please.</i>

896
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,886
You're looking at me, at us,

897
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:33,771
but we don't exist, not
legally, not officially,

898
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:39,127
because German intelligence
needs a job to be done

899
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,487
that German law won't let it do,

900
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:45,406
so me and my people we stay small.

901
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,725
We stay on the streets.

902
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,964
We make the weather.

903
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,407
Our sources don't come to us, we find them.

904
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,040
We become their friends.

905
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,367
Their brothers, their fathers,

906
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,568
their lovers, if we have to.

907
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,564
When they're ours, and only then,

908
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,211
we direct them at bigger targets.

909
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,329
It takes a minnow to catch a barracuda.

910
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,243
A barracuda to catch a shark.

911
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,209
<i>I don't fish, Herr Bachmann.</i>

912
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,645
It's a metaphor, Erhardt.

913
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,120
Just a metaphor.

914
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,521
We take our time.

915
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,602
We watch. We wait.

916
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,642
We see what Allah provides.

917
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:34,010
Well, this time Allah has provided
lssa Karpov and his ill-gotten millions.

918
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,922
As you can see from
the report my team has compiled,

919
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:46,207
Dr. Abdullah has provided
an extensive list of his favorite charities

920
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,965
to be the recipients of those millions.

921
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,243
Each one of those charities
has been CIA cleared.

922
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:59,126
It is my belief he will replace
one of the names on this list with another.

923
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,765
Seven Friends Navigation Company.

924
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,722
What kind of proof can you show us?

925
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,048
Proof is what we're looking for.

926
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,963
If this Abdullah,

927
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,051
if this barracuda,
if I've understood the metaphor,

928
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,842
takes the bait,

929
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,730
with what leverage
will you secure his cooperation?

930
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,170
On the negative,

931
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,321
threat of prosecution, prison,

932
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,683
public humiliation,
discrediting of his charities,

933
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,161
deportation of his wife and children.

934
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,925
I choose the positive.

935
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:43,768
Amnesty, citizenship, for which he
has applied half a dozen times.

936
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,444
Now we are offering citizenship
to financiers of terror?

937
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,244
You are all familiar
with the operational plan?

938
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,722
We have three hours to apprehend Abdullah
and make him ours

939
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,770
and get him back home
before anyone notices.

940
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,683
And if he does not comply?

941
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,807
Then he's yours.

942
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,201
Do with him whatever you need to do.

943
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,487
And lssa Karpov?

944
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,130
He's to be left alone.

945
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:11,170
In my eyes it's unacceptable.

946
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,811
Find someone else
to parade before the cameras.

947
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,450
That was agreed.

948
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,443
He has our protection.

949
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,921
Martha, what is the American perspective?

950
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,884
Maybe if you could define for us

951
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,203
what you think
the long-term objective would be.

952
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,449
What are we trying to achieve?

953
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,084
To make the world a safer place.

954
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,364
Isn't that enough?

955
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,211
Mr. Brue?

956
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,850
Tomorrow morning.

957
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,727
Thank you for letting me know.

958
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,165
How are you feeling?

959
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,081
Good.

960
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,363
You drop him at the bank
and then you disappear.

961
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,644
Do you understand?

962
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,247
You are forcing me to betray my own father.

963
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,769
You are not betraying him.
You are saving him.

964
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,290
That is an act of love.

965
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,602
He's been granted asylum.

966
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,522
It was the best I could do.

967
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,285
I gave you lssa.

968
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,442
Lssa gives you Abdullah.

969
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,326
What's next?

970
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,048
What will you do to him?

971
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,884
- To Abdullah?
- Yes.

972
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,285
Nothing bad.

973
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,001
I promise.

974
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,166
Look.

975
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,689
What does this mean?

976
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,925
It means you can stay.

977
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,122
I have something for you.

978
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,402
<i>- Doctor.
- Hello, Mr. Brue.</i>

979
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,808
<i>This confirms
the receipt of funds from Mr. Karpov</i>

980
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,680
<i>in to your new account we've set up here.</i>

981
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:39,800
<i>These are the charities you specified
with their bank details.</i>

982
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:47,245
<i>Each of the transfers is logged
in to our system and is ready to go.</i>

983
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,010
<i>Would you please check all the details?</i>

984
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,283
<i>The name of the account holders and
the money assigned to each recipient</i>

985
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,682
<i>and then authorize each one
with your signature.</i>

986
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,602
<i>I would like to make a substitute.</i>

987
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,648
<i>I need to change a name.</i>

988
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,686
<i>Seven Friends Navigation Company?</i>

989
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,807
<i>Yes.</i>

990
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:07,727
<i>It is a shipping company,
but one whose business is charity.</i>

991
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:11,411
<i>We can have all the aid in the world</i>

992
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:15,530
<i>but it's worthless unless you can
get it to the people who need it.</i>

993
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,407
<i>Yes.</i>

994
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,327
<i>All right.</i>

995
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,531
<i>Your final signature.</i>

996
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,123
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

997
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,531
<i>Excuse me.</i>

998
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,523
Unfortunately my son is delayed.

999
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,129
Allow us to call you a taxi.

1000
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,364
- I'm going in.
- Good luck.

1001
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:03,841
Right.

1002
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,161
Yes.

1003
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,208
Taxi for Brue Frères.

1004
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,725
A pleasure.

1005
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,724
My direction, Blankenese.

1006
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,446
Stay back!

1007
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,121
Wait.

1008
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:34,847
Stop! What are you doing?

1009
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:36,206
- Wait.
- No!

1010
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,841
No.

1011
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:40,966
Lssa!

1012
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,201
- What's going on?
- No!

1013
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,406
No!

1014
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,081
Stand up.

1015
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,241
No!

1016
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,520
No!

1017
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,445
Lssa, no!

1018
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,648
Stop it! No!

1019
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,325
No, lssa!

1020
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,444
Fuck!

1021
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:35,161
Fuck!
