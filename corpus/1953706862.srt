1
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,323
These are the facts:

2
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,574
In February 1959, 9
Russian travelers ventured in the Urals

3
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,680
Two weeks later, all
nine were found dead.

4
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:39,081
Became known as the Incident Dyatlov Step.

5
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,482
- Okay, go.
- My name is Holly King.

6
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:50,213
I am a student of psychology
at the University of Oregon.

7
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:59,225
Gathered in a remote area
in the Ural Mountains in Russia

8
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:04,143
trying to solve the mystery that devastated
the world for nearly 50 years

9
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,306
known as "Incident Dyatlov Step"

10
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:12,101
thanks to leader
1959 expedition, Igor Dyatlov.

11
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:13,307
They failed.

12
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,374
But I was struck by the story

13
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,584
and when my favorite teacher,
Dr. Kittles spoke at room

14
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,904
On a project dealing with the
incident, did not believe.

15
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:25,898
Commented to a friend, Jenson,
a film student here

16
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:28,957
and he said that we should make a movie

17
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:32,173
then ask a purse, and...

18
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:33,803
Achieved.

19
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,138
Okay, then...

20
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,956
What happened?

21
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:42,187
I heard the first time about the incident
by a Russian journalist, Yuri

22
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:45,442
who published a fictionalized
version of a book of sci-fi

23
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,831
"The Highest Level of
Complexity Yuri Yarovoi"

24
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,030
Sure he had him killed.

25
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:54,055
Russian writer Yuri Yarovoi
crashed into a empty road on 01/28/1980.

26
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,421
No matter who has fictionalized the facts

27
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:59,973
they do not want anyone
talking about Dyatlov.

28
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:04,066
And I started to use the "incident"
as an exercise teaching in psychology

29
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,837
Because there is a lot to know
what happened in Dyatlov Pass

30
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:09,547
in such detail

31
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:12,643
and whole thing still remains
shrouded in mystery.

32
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,464
What explanations usually used?

33
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,584
The most common explanations
call "scientific"

34
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:22,422
is a disease called dementia hypothermia...

35
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:23,976
Dementia hypothermia

36
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,800
this is literally the most widely used,

37
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:29,105
but my preferred

38
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,639
is called...

39
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:32,797
"Paradoxical undressing".

40
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:36,216
It's something that happens with
severe hypothermia sufferers,

41
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:41,083
disoriented, think they are
overheated and bare all.

42
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,436
Holly, 9 were experienced there,

43
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:49,266
tells me that they all
had hypothermia severe

44
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,592
while the same night?

45
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:57,666
They were out 3 days ago,
because at that moment?

46
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:01,645
An avalanche is another frequent response.

47
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,795
This, is even more stupid

48
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,906
than "paradoxical undressing".

49
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:10,936
Hearing the avalanche would be the
3 hours out camping without boots?

50
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:14,907
But after entering answers
the question nameless

51
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:18,451
my students will introduce their own fears

52
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,572
The Russian army?

53
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:22,666
I hope my students
propose something more believable...

54
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,479
I want to put them in place of those people

55
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:31,136
to understand why
victims did what they did,

56
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,640
this is the answer we seek.

57
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,259
Let's find out the truth?

58
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:40,545
- You know you'll never find out.
- What?

59
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,054
There is no truth.

60
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:51,387
The first leg of our journey will
Eugene-Oregon-Chelyabinsk Russia.

61
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:56,039
Not going to use those stupid dotted
to show the journey, right?

62
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,674
Wrong!

63
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,857
The last destination is Kholat Syakhl,

64
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:06,017
literally translated as
"the Mountain of the Dead."

65
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:08,216
Seriously!

66
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:12,536
The name takes into account the
numerous mysterious deaths

67
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:16,067
and disappearances
throughout history, so...

68
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:20,706
Find an audio engineer, Denise Evers.

69
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:26,158
The only operator on campus
audio that fills... physical requirements.

70
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,377
Bunch of skinny guys in Audio.

71
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:32,430
What's wrong with skinny?

72
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,611
Ah, sorry, was wrong.

73
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,417
And then we found two capable guides.

74
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:42,112
Andy Thatcher, President of
Northwest Trails Association...

75
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,557
Climbed all the mountains of the
USA, and also mochilei by TA.

76
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,355
- Forgiveness?
- The Appalachian Trail,

77
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:51,562
stretches from Maine to Georgia
I went in the summer.

78
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:55,354
- So you think you realize that?
- Yes

79
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,302
Why would you do that?

80
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:02,483
No more I can climb
U.S., is a challenge for me.

81
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:05,262
- Are you afraid?
- No.

82
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:08,809
You know, recreate a trip
where 9 people died.

83
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:12,588
50 years ago, come on?
Not the Snowman.

84
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:14,831
- Yeti!
- He's gone now.

85
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,643
- And you are?
- Is JP Hauser.

86
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,932
- JP.
- I drew.

87
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,071
You think you're ready for this?

88
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:23,920
This guy was here
in Himalayas, is ready.

89
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,330
- Really?
- Yes

90
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,065
- I took some time off.
- A long time off.

91
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:34,771
What kind of Hauser?
Hauser Hall?

92
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:38,130
Type construction that we are facing?

93
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,011
A itself.

94
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:44,332
This reminds me of my philosophy,
I take care of children after!

95
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,945
We have our team, it's time to work
:

96
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,981
studied maps, prepare gear and join
chopped and supplies

97
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,543
and then trained in the local mountains,

98
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:59,853
are excited and eager to go.

99
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:04,598
- I hate those snowshoes.
- It is so cool with them, Jenson.

100
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:08,093
Hey, what do you think of these boots?

101
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:14,376
Almost all hate that.

102
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,232
Shit!

103
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:20,694
Now, January 25...

104
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,726
Is time to leave.

105
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:28,420
Still looking for 5 students
missing last month

106
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,356
in the Urals.

107
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:34,673
Remember that three days
rescuers found items

108
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:39,505
to be students, tents, backpacks
and other equipment.

109
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:45,049
Ivan, our Russian correspondent
Channel 24 has more information.

110
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:50,357
Good afternoon, I'm Ivan Kudryavtsev
and you're watching the Russia-Canal24,

111
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:55,302
continue following the event that occupies
the attention of the international media

112
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,835
and the news is more
commented in Russia

113
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,946
the disappearance of the Ural Mountains
a group of American documentary filmmakers

114
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:07,436
that, as you may know, followed the
steps of the expedition Igor Dyatlov

115
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:14,163
9 whose members died in mysterious
circumstances in 1959.

116
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,110
Experts
raise several theories for disappearances.

117
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:22,911
I think I made contact with aliens,
a ship or something...

118
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:28,976
In recent years there have been
several interesting phenomena on site.

119
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:32,652
The more I study the place, date
mysterious signs and...

120
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,966
And sinister, even mystical,

121
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:39,493
area is shrouded in mystery, which feeds
such theories, even the mystic

122
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:47,171
are understandable because has long been
reports that testify objects in the sky

123
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:52,764
and today this area is common
reports of Yeti footprints.

124
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,266
Also a native tribe, ethnicity
Mansi, have their own theory.

125
00:08:57,284 --> 00:09:01,557
An elder Mansi remember that when
group Dyatlov disappeared,

126
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,414
Native reported noises and balls
of fire over the mountains.

127
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:09,532
Believe that place...

128
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:12,756
Is where two worlds collide...

129
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:19,159
where you can pass from
one world to another...

130
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:24,133
Is where
enters the world of spirits.

131
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:27,377
The Canal24-24 Russia continues to inform

132
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:31,127
recent disappearances
in the northern Urals,

133
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:36,161
where 5 U.S. documentary filmmakers
disappeared mysteriously

134
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:41,259
in the same place, in 1959, the group
Igor Dyatlov died.

135
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,213
Thank you, Ivan.

136
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:53,437
Students recreated the ill-fated journey
seized by Igor Dyatlov

137
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,416
8 and other Russian explorers
50 years ago for a documentary.

138
00:09:57,423 --> 00:10:01,262
The most promising clue is found
equipment team recording

139
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:05,333
Experts watched the footage without
disclose it in the press, but today,

140
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:10,192
a group of hackers calling themselves
ConspiraLeaks gained access to footage

141
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,322
and posted on their web-site.

142
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,615
I opened the door and darkness
followed me, and in my dream.

143
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:19,192
Hey, come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

144
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,304
- It was just a dream, just a dream.
- Excuse me.

145
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:25,611
Jenson, never leave here.

146
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,096
Excuse me...

147
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,982
One month before

148
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:49,444
We arrived to Russia and the next
point of our journey is Chelyabinsk

149
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,607
and then to the Urals, into a city called
Ivdel.

150
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:57,514
- Beautiful tattoo, angel! Has another wing?
- It's unique, and it hurt like hell.

151
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,223
Anything else I should know,
something you want to show to the camera?

152
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,837
Keep dreaming, pervert.
And this phone?

153
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:09,051
It is equipped with GPS universal,
and where there is no signal,

154
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,413
here GPS navigates
anywhere in the world.

155
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,223
Cool!

156
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:18,579
Sorry, can not help
know I did not bring fluid.

157
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,004
- Do not do it.
- Talking to the camera?

158
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,701
Chatting with Lucile.

159
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,333
Really?
Type a girl?

160
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:29,463
Filmmaker
are quite connected in their cameras.

161
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:32,352
No power, baby, she's jealous.

162
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:35,401
- Thank you.
- Quite linked...

163
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,979
Thank you.

164
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:47,730
What do you think? Think will put
backpacks and spend the week?

165
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,256
Is a test, you know?
Man against the elements.

166
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:55,466
Millennia People survive without
these things happening,

167
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,615
just do everything right,
and I bet you will.

168
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,392
Your confidence is daunting.

169
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,265
Enters those without trust,
you will not return.

170
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,527
And you, JP?

171
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,806
I thought well,
and live only once,

172
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:16,216
want to try to see and
do as much as possible,

173
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:19,132
I have everything I need in
backpack for months...

174
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,189
- That?
- For years, maybe. Yes, that.

175
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:24,595
How many people can say that?

176
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,266
I hope that does not need much.

177
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:31,638
- Yes, you never know.
- Never know.

178
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:41,303
We spent Monday in Ivdel,
then we can interview Piotr Karov,

179
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,055
the 10th member of the Dyatlov, who
got sick on the first day and came back,

180
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:52,661
shortly after he had a breakdown and
came to this Psychiatric Hospital.

181
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:58,414
Back.
Stop the camera!

182
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,355
Hey, hey,
does not touch the camera!

183
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,963
Turn it off!

184
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,949
- No recordings!
- Yeah, tell that to the camera!

185
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:08,754
- Go away, please!
- The Cold War is over, we're friends.

186
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,001
We can not interview
Piotr Karov?

187
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,348
- He died. Now go.
- What?

188
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,345
- How did he die?
- Go!

189
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:20,613
- Friendly, no?
- Holly, in the upstairs window!

190
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,499
What?
Is it?

191
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:29,018
- I can not understand.
- Oh! Ow!

192
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,769
It was Karov?
What did he say?

193
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:34,972
- Have you seen?
- What the hell!

194
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:47,497
I know I look like Jenson, but I
believe I saw Piotr Karov that window,

195
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,425
and I really want to know
what they tried to show,

196
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:53,447
but could not,
and trains do not go here

197
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:57,467
Try to ride Vizhaj,
let's start backpacking.

198
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:02,254
Best Jenson unless U.S. ambassador,
could restart the Cold War.

199
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:05,625
Okay, these guys say
bar here has a native

200
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:09,944
then we should give because there
has a native, the family is Vizhaj

201
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,788
are we can get a ride,
sounds good?

202
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:16,828
- Come on.
- Bar does not sound good.

203
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:20,085
- It's the wrong way!
- No, this is where we should go.

204
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,302
That's what I was talking about! Jenson
1 0 Andy.

205
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:27,069
Look, accept dogs,
Company home.

206
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,712
- Hilarious!
- Calm!

207
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,479
Holly, you know because it has no
drunk driver in Russia?

208
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,370
- No. - Yeah, give!
- Hey, a photo! Come on!

209
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:37,187
- Yes!
- I timer on the camera.

211
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,777
Come on!

212
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,516
- A... - Xis. - Two... - Three...
- West Coast!

213
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:58,350
Do you speak English?

214
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,525
Course.

215
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:02,646
- Something to drink?
- Yes, please!

216
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,401
Jenson, looked for a ride.

217
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:09,670
We are young beautiful people
foreign land who would like a drink.

218
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:12,241
- Where are they going?
- Vizhaj.

219
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,300
And then that drink?

220
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:17,034
Vizhaj?

221
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,046
Why?

222
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:23,308
We are making a documentary about
the incident from Step Dyatlov.

223
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:24,895
Ah...

224
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,909
So should try it!

225
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,870
- What's in there?
- VIP gentlemen.

226
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,237
- Here comes the shot!
- Shooting? Oh, no.

00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:41,531
Owe me a special favor,
anyone have a cigarette?

228
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:45,246
Looks like they're having fun.

229
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:51,394
- Beautiful... - Memorable bottle, huh?
- Beautiful bottle.

230
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:56,353
- God, she smelled?
- Yes!

231
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,028
Fede.

232
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:00,913
- Maybe not so full.
- Chora!

233
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,087
They are great!

234
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,414
Let us then!

235
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,521
- Then I start?
- Wait, wait!

236
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,140
God, what a mess.

237
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:21,240

- Gonna mess with me, kid.

238
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,941

- Thank you.
- "In zdorovje"

241
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,692
What?

242
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,243
I mean, I know nothing about the people,
culture, history or women

243
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,504
Russia but did my duty as
home to good manners.

244
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:42,441
- So... cheers!
- Cheers guys!

245
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,631
Shit heavy!

246
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:54,571
You guys are viadinhos?

247
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:56,771
- What is it?
- Well ..

248
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:59,822
- Sa-ma-gon.
- Samagon.

249
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,328
Like a drop coaster.

250
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,536
Yes, because it served Samagon?

251
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:07,134
Serve them right here.

252
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:09,809
- Before leaving.
- Who? Who are they?

253
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:13,033
Dyatlov!
Drank it before leaving.

254
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,949
Stop it.
Not funny.

255
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:28,857
- There is an omen, right?
- No, it's just a coincidence.

256
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,487
- We want another round, friend.
- Yes!

257
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:35,188
- Get down! - Making a movie?
- That's right.

00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,849
- And going Vizhaj?
- Yes

259
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:40,892
Yes, you know how to get there?

260
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:43,226
'll Take you.

261
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,262
Go?
All right.

262
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,124
Leave tomorrow!

263
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,038
- Yes - Yes
- And take all?

264
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,625
No problem.

265
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,518
I said it would work.

266
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,843
Okay, serve this guy a drink?

267
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:58,608
- A drink. - What do you want?
- Vodka.

268
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,946
Thank you very much.

269
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,688
No problem, I'm Sergei.

270
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:07,787
See, not so bad.

271
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:14,321
- Who let Jenson go ahead?
- At least we have the girls, bro!

272
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,360
- Keep dreaming.
- How far is...?

273
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,975
Vizhaj.
Some 40 miles (65kms).

274
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,880
Forty?
Great.

275
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:27,168
At least we have enough potatoes for stupid
chew.

276
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:53,154
- Denise, let's go!
- Guys?

277
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,457
My eyes froze shut!

278
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,479
Not funny.
What do I do?

279
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,614
- Wait, do not move.
- Take it easy on her, Andy!

280
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,715
- Hold on!
- Shit.

281
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,401
Expected, the other!

282
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,781
There is.
Everything okay?

283
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,043
Yes Thanks.

284
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:30,199
Cold here? I feel that...
You're...

285
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:33,176
- Feels like... cold.
- Okay, let's go!

286
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,543
No, man!
Not cool.

287
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:41,498
- I'll give you $ 100 if you lick the bumper!
- I'll give you a dollar sucking JP.

288
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,548
Come on, guys!

289
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:47,873
Hey, will love it. I found that
Sergei came to visit her aunt.

290
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,503
Wow, that too!

291
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,514
No, she was part of the first
rescuers to see Dyatlov.

292
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,857
- Wait, seriously?
- Yes

293
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:59,991
- I asked her to speak if they want
- Yes, I do!

294
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,847
- I want.
- I'll be in the movie, right?

295
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,192
- You bet!
- She speaks English?

296
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,119
Better than I!

297
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,563
Can you translate something for me?

298
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,161
- Here, take the camera.
- Yes, of course.

299
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,953
Let's go and find her aunt.

300
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:18,358
- What's her name?
- Alya.

301
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,432
She is a teacher.

302
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:24,867
What is this?

303
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,299
Piotr The name arose.

304
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:41,266
- Like this?
- Yeah, I guess.

305
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,865
What does it mean?

306
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,803
Stay away!

307
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,349
Tell us what happened.

308
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:57,543
My brother Vallik, father
Sergei, found the first body,

309
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:01,550
still remember how he screamed,

310
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,751
when he returned later.

311
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,672
Proceed.

312
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:19,100
Did not take long to find the others,

313
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,343
track...

314
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,806
A trail of corpses...

315
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,921
Find two

316
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,925
and woman

317
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:38,677
a trail to campfire set up where

318
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,636
there we two

319
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,515
and four, in the ravine.

320
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:50,543
We were so sad,

321
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,533
but not surprised

322
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,157
when we discovered

323
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,631
there were no survivors,

324
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,222
but it was so weird...

325
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,538
I felt,

326
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:13,731
people got nervous...

327
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,475
I felt so,

328
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,534
had something wrong with the place,

329
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:28,952
I left there wanting to get rid of it
,

330
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:32,396
was when I found two more

331
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,162
on the north side.

332
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:38,572
There was something wrong with them,

333
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,780
more than others,

334
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,923
and something...

335
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,597
Snow near them.

336
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,324
A machine!

337
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:57,683
- As strange.
- Excuse me.

338
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,151
Let...
Cut a minute.

339
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:02,887
So found 11 bodies.

340
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,988
-
Yes - Are you sure?

341
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,804
I know what I saw, young lady,

342
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:15,516
'll never forget.

343
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:22,554
But the reports, photos of
scene, all report only 9.

344
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:24,187
So what?

345
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:29,441
Believe what everyone tells you to believe

346
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:33,108
or else believe in your own heart?

347
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,511
'll Leave them a trail next.

348
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,807
Not like we have

349
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:47,560
- I told you!
- Did what?

350
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:49,932
Aliens!
What else can it be?

351
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:54,613
And the military? You said
conducted an experiment with them.

352
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:59,792
- Well then change my vote pros aliens.
- Yes, it makes much more sense, Jenson

353
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:05,842
And you, Andy? The think the
theory of aliens Jenson?

354
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:11,019
- Stupid.
- It is the silent type, huh?

355
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,965
I do not think Andy agrees with his theory.

356
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:17,850
Whatever.

357
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:21,158
Do not get me shoot?
Shoots mountains.

358
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,747
Sounds interesting, JP.

359
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:36,233
Hey, Andy!
Denise did not take his eyes off you.

360
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:40,768
Yes, your eyes say:
Oh, Jesus!

361
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,894
What an idiot!

362
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:49,841
So, guys, it's all what they expected
?

363
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:52,071
-
Yes - Oh, yes.

364
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:55,488
!
The words lost?

365
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,009
Is this?

366
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,857
- This what?
- "Kholat Syakhl"

367
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:02,882
Yes

368
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,208
The Mountain of the Dead!

369
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,180
Jesus!

370
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:18,841
As you can see, the weather changes quickly
,

371
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,886
and changed.

372
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:24,378
My racquet again!

373
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,862
Piece of shit.

374
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:33,565
- We could die here.
- Better go before nightfall.

375
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,520
- The weather will change.
- Jenson!

376
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:38,384
- Yo! - Just one more picture!
- Come!

377
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,582
Guys, this is too much!

378
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,905
So Mr. Hauser, which tricks
cooking at camp?

379
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:04,256
Well, I like to do
as simple as possible, so...

380
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:11,357
You have to Dried Mountain Chili...
delicious.

381
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,763
You know I'm vegetarian, right?

382
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,959
- Really?
- Yes

383
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:20,572
Do not know...

384
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:25,689
Okay, so let bottled water?

385
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:27,450
Is using the snow?

386
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:32,322
We need fresh water, but without
drama: the snow boiling kills bacteria.

387
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:35,476
- Smell amazing.
- JP, his master cook.

388
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,274
Wait but...

389
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,481
Will burn your mouth.

390
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,228
Idiot!

00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:58,481
- Looks tasty.
- Is it all the time?

396
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,342

398
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:10,920

00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:13,533
Thank you.

00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,244
- Life-Size.

401
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,278
- I can show you later if you want.
- Sure can.

402
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,608
How many nights

403
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,400
Two.

404
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:32,448
Tasty.

405
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,695
How's the pepperoni?

406
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,121
Good

407
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,080
- Want?
- No, thank you.

408
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,407
Oh Jenson

00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:42,603

410
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,228
- This is sexy.
- Is sexy?

411
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:52,549
How's your first experience on a film set
professional?

412
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:54,640
And this is a professional set?

413
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:57,717
This? It's the best set
which could start.

414
00:27:57,729 --> 00:28:00,488
It's cool, but what about you?
As thought was backpacking?

415
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:03,592
- I thought it was good, easy.
- It? - I need sleep...

416
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:06,586
And gives you backpacking,
and gives you mountains.

417
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,614
Hoped to lead the expedition tomorrow.

418
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,482
Food can not stick with it.

419
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:15,974
- Think, smart!
- It's a dick, is not understood.

420
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,087
But guess
feel the difference, huh?

421
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:21,513
Jesus Christ.

422
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:23,247
And hearing this, 'm satisfied.

423
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,743
- Do not want to hear.
- If called hilarious. - Really?

424
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,302
Is not it beautiful?

425
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:31,151
What?

426
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,195
The aurora borealis.

427
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,684
Oh, right.

428
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:40,034
Yeah, well...

429
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,724
Adorable.

430
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:46,194
- How is your tongue?
- Well

431
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:55,151
Now, forget the aurora borealis,
Garner Denise is there.

432
00:28:55,175 --> 00:29:00,140
Believe me, I'm not interested
in perverting Denise moment.

433
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,473
Okay, what are you doing?

434
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:09,679
Week Incident reported
orange lights in the sky,

435
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:12,342
six witnesses totally different.

436
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:15,656
- Aliens?
- Is what most think,

437
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:20,696
the official report was "unusual
atmospheric conditions"

438
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:25,146
Light of reflected light in
clouds or something.

439
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:28,746
- But I do not believe it?
- Hey, is not sleep?

440
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:31,073
Start early tomorrow.

441
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:33,248
- Okay.
- What?

442
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:35,885
The big day.

443
00:29:35,902 --> 00:29:39,097
Yes, I'll just...
See this.

444
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:41,095
Okay.

445
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:48,616
What was that?

446
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,820
- What was that?
- That Sound!

447
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:53,924
Forget.

448
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,540
Holly! Arise! Something was here,
gotta see this!

449
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,124
- Is jokingly Jenson?
- Holy shit!

450
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,601
- What the hell.
- Okay. Action

451
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,224
- Denise?
- Do not like it!

452
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,115
Denise, if something happened,
was last night.

453
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,538
Do not know.

454
00:30:08,547 --> 00:30:12,818
I do not see any danger, I know it
is strange and so I want to shoot.

455
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,853
Okay, whatever.

456
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:16,886
Can you wait a minute?

457
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:20,064
Thank you.

458
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,286
You idiot!

459
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,840
Okay,
woke up and found something strange:

460
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:33,383
footprints, located between these
two stones and around the tents,

461
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,621
format is strange,
see how big they are?

462
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:41,992
And the other... is greater...
Two pairs, two different people.

463
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:44,838
- People?!
- I speak not of Yeti, Jenson!

464
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,341
Come on, look at the size
of these footprints!

465
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:49,807
I do not know, a bear, a tiger
Snow!

466
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:54,142
- What? Snow tiger?!
- The Snow Tiger is extinct Denise!

467
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,590
What is more strange:

468
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:59,171
Anyone walking in this type
Snow boots need special

469
00:30:59,172 --> 00:31:03,218
need to grip, then use
stakes or gloves well modeled,

470
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:07,094
but are footprints soft, and is
whatever, were bare.

471
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,327
Andy told us that low
night temperature here...

472
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:13,043
- Freeze the toes in 10 minutes.
- What explains the Yeti.

473
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:16,440
- There's your fucking Yeti!
- How do you know? - The damned do not exist!

474
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,831
- Do not know!
- By God, Jenson!

475
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,432
Okay, filming.

476
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:23,924
No footprints are inside
or outside of campgrounds,

477
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,395
is as if something fell from the sky,
walked barefoot around the stalls

478
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:30,464
and then rise again.

479
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,356
- Yeti flies too?
- Hey, Mike. - Hey.

480
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:34,587
Can we go?

481
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:37,577
- Has snow tiger here?
- No damn tigers here.

482
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,280
Come.

483
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,953
Not have to cross it, right?

484
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:43,915
No.

485
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:48,088
- are well? All morning quiet.
- Yeah, all right.

486
00:31:48,112 --> 00:31:51,520
- Do not look fine.
- So for us to fill.

487
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,732
They think I'm filling?

488
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,951
No, we think Bigfoot
was in camping last night.

489
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,804
How could it be fake?

490
00:31:58,813 --> 00:32:03,027
Okay, Holly, nobody ever did
Bigfoot footprints in the snow.

491
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,925
He's right, Holly,

492
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:09,952
fun is cool, but
look around you,

493
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,822
is the last place
to scare someone.

494
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,547
Do not know what they are talking about.

495
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:22,265
Left So say we all
the limit this morning.

496
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:37,354
Holly!
Did you hear that?

497
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:43,798
The entire team wonders
whence comes this strange sound,

498
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:47,464
watched the tape and no one can tell where
is

499
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:49,495
and then found this...

500
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:54,262
As in camping,
the trail has no beginning or end...

501
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:55,843
're A little scared.

502
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:59,024
Holly! Come here,
more footprints!

503
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:05,191
- What is it?
- A meteorological tower.

504
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:09,619
The footprints are all over the area here.
The collar measures the wind speed.

505
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,702
No more, probably.

506
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:21,612
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Following the footprints.

507
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:25,975
Whatever makes that sound,
is here, and want to know why.

508
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:30,659
- E?
- Wait.

509
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:32,819
What the...

510
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:38,236
- You okay?
- Okay?

511
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,361
-
Yes - Are you sure?

512
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,242
Holly...

513
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:46,270
A language?

514
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:50,119
- It's not safe, Holly!
- Yes, that's what I saw.

515
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:53,200
Seriously, it's a language!
We must go now!

516
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,694
- Denise, can only...
- And the footprints?

517
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:59,026
- Jenson said it comes from there, listen!
- Voyage of Jenson. Give me a minute?

518
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,385
Hey, come on.

519
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,829
Is filling the bag with this stupid movie
.

520
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,321
Okay?

521
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,295
Is everything okay?

522
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:13,163
Yes, just scared,
is everything.

523
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,530
But you know, everyone is.

524
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,901
I heard about these steps
mountain in China

525
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:26,400
where birds fly against walls and
people and animals go crazy and die

526
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:31,204
and all because the wind generates a sound
4 Mega Hertz

527
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,061
that makes people get mad.

528
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:36,524
- I think that...
- Wind crazy?

529
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,638
Jenson, all saw the tape and
hear whatever it is.

530
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:44,010
Please tell me what is?

531
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,702
I heard this before.

532
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,924
Jesus Jenson.

533
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,225
This mountain is really "fantastic".

534
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:58,776
I stopped someone
mention how much I hate these rackets?

535
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,681
Someone?
No?

536
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,135
- Guys, wait!
- Come on slug.

537
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,132
Guys, wait, is here we come!

538
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:23,295
- Thank God!
- Are you sure?

539
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:28,628
I saw the pictures hundreds of times,
this is, was what happened here,

540
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,728
this is Step Dyatlov.

541
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:41,476
53 years ago today that nine people armed
camping in the same soil,

542
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:44,432
they had dinner and went to bed

543
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:49,434
and somewhere between 9 and 11
the night, something that Russian officials

544
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:53,020
defined as "uncontrollable force unknown"

545
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:56,733
caused the flight of nine of its
tents in such a state of terror

546
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:59,748
they tore the inside
and threw the night,

547
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:02,450
to 17 degrees below zero.

548
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:05,926
Gonna love this, Andy.
TV socket.

549
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:07,868
It?
Which one?

550
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:09,722
A gay.

551
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:12,408
- It was good.
- Gracinha, Jenson.

552
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,633
Rustem Slobodin, 23,

553
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,665
the first to be found.

554
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,191
Igor Dyatlov, 23,

555
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:27,317
scout leader and most
experienced of the group,

556
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,296
probably was his idea to try
to go back to barracks.

557
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,004
Kolmogorova Zinaida, 22

558
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,941
just a year older than I am now

559
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,504
was the nearest camping
when the force arrived,

560
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:41,426
and only victim that showed signal strength
,

561
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:45,372
was no language and a large portion of your
oral cavity.

562
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:48,998
Dubinina Ludmila, 21,

563
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:51,809
Nicolai Thibeaux-Brignolles,

564
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,709
Alexandrovich Zolotarev,

565
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,616
Alexander Kolevatov.

566
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:04,425
The cause of death for all victims
was defined as hypothermia,

567
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:08,834
But Rustem and Nicolai also
had serious skull fractures,

568
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:13,540
and Ludmila and Zolotarev
Alexandrovich also had broken ribs,

569
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:17,551
but no bodies tried to defend injuries

570
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,411
on the other hand does not have
external injuries...

571
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:24,455
Somehow, something tried
crush the skull of two men

572
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,727
and broke ribs and Ludmila Alexandrovich

573
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:30,570
without leaving anything more than bruises.

574
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:36,459
Moreover, Alexandrovich was positive for
high concentration of radiation.

575
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,370
Hello!

576
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:45,926
Where here
contracted Alexandrovich much radiation?

577
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:48,034
And because he alone?

578
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:51,426
Georgiy Krivonischenko, 24,

579
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,358
Yuri Doroshenko, 21,

580
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,101
when others fled,

581
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:00,931
they sat quietly near the rest of the fire

582
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:03,653
Quietly and froze to death.

583
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:15,018
- What is it, Andy?
- Nothing.

584
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,390
Not sound like anything.

585
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:20,945
The GPS seems primed,
should not be at this point.

586
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,100
Seems suspect.

587
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:26,562
Think this is my fault too?

588
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,884
- I dunno, it ruined?
- Not!

589
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:32,753
She must have moved at my watch
Also, the altimeter burned,

590
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:34,489
it and see,

591
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:39,684
compass went crazy, went pro Himalayas with
and it always worked, but here.

592
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,623
I think we should leave.

593
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,613
- What? Just arrived!
- But we have to go back...

594
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,460
're Blind without GPS or reliable map.

595
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:55,854
- What's wrong with the map?
- There should already be here.

596
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,700
How so?

597
00:38:57,715 --> 00:39:03,362
According map covered 23 kms today
not arrive before midnight.

598
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,483
So what?
We are fast.

599
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:08,807
Look, let's go and follow
compass to stop freaking out

600
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,968
is obvious that some of the magnetic field
rocks and such

601
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:15,760
stop elsewhere that no one
would notice the difference.

602
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:19,311
- I have to finish the images before.
- Forget about the footage, Holly!

603
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,539
Obvious that something
is wrong, we should go,

604
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,417
begin to put it all together, gives
time.

605
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:26,019
No, no, no, do not want to get
,

606
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,380
but if we start together and we will be
walking in the dark and that's not good.

607
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:33,174
Guys, it's a night

608
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:37,779
people live for thousands of years
without clocks and without GPS

609
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,808
I think we got one night,

610
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:42,914
what was to come.

611
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,534
Okay, let's have dinner.

612
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,388
Thank you.

613
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:00,406
Hey.

614
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,101
's Going on a date there.

615
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:04,272
Strange, I feel that I am
sailing.

616
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:06,888
Just do not understand what she sees
a guy like him.

617
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,328
- It's so arrogant...
- Confident...

618
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,062
- Full of himself... - Arrogant...
- Asshole...

619
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:14,109
You know, there's a room that
tent, you come in?

620
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:17,167
Oh, maybe you too,
I'm sure I will someday

621
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:20,739
boyfriend as cool as Andy, so...

622
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,180
What are you doing?

623
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:23,688
Nothing, just...

624
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:26,390
Shit!

625
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:30,347
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:40:30,348 --> 00:40:33,030
It is one of the reasons why
can not find anyone.

627
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:35,594
Not find anyone,
so I'm going with you.

628
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,428
In their desires.

629
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:46,385
You know what Andy said...
About the magnetic field of the rocks?

630
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:48,401
Yes?

631
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:50,488
And if not that?

632
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,093
Okay,

633
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:57,966
tell us what you have there.

634
00:40:57,984 --> 00:41:01,292
So, this is a pretty basic Geiger counter
,

635
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,381
without complicating,
it detects radiation levels.

636
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:12,945
Like here,

637
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:16,163
definitely no radiation in this area.

638
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:20,297
Uranium could be rocks here?

639
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:26,838
There is nothing dangerous, but
is more than you should.

640
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:31,285
Yes, the source of it...

641
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,427
Surely comes from there.

642
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,382
Let's check.

643
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:46,538
- In this direction.
- Beware!

644
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:50,326
Lucile not like it.

645
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:52,628
I think I found something.

646
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,003
Hey, Jenson.

647
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:58,937
See that thin ice there?

648
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:01,115
-
Yes - Snow...

649
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:03,107
Yes?
What is?

650
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,794
Looks like someone was here,

651
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:08,886
type in recent days...

652
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,773
Be careful!

653
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:12,617
Okay.

654
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:14,805
Here well up here.

655
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:24,971
- Holly, beware!
- Okay.

656
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,254
Wait.

657
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:31,470
Jenson, I think it's a rock.

658
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:39,786
- Shit! you're Getting this?
- To picking, I'm picking up.

659
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:44,427
Be careful!

660
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,637
- See that?
- Yes

661
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,536
Continue, continue.

662
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,353
Come on!

663
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,839
- What is it?
- I do not know.

664
00:42:57,863 --> 00:43:00,291
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jenson!

665
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:01,684
See that?

666
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:03,137
Tell the camera what you see!

667
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,534
What do you see? Let
.

668
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,390
A cave or something...

669
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:10,880
God, Jenson...
lower the camera and come help me.

670
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:14,251
- It's a door!
- What?

671
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:17,103
Lower the camera.

672
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:19,177
We have to film this!

673
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:22,570
's So weird!

674
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,186
Of course it is, Jenson, see!

675
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:28,278
Is a door in the middle of the mountains
!

676
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:31,302
What are locked from the other side?

677
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:36,487
Is designed to keep something inside.

678
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:40,209
- Yes, but what?
- Holly!

679
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,829
Look around, come on!

680
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:46,133
The Russian government took a long time
building a big solid door

681
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,616
to store something in the
mountain, we must not...

682
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:51,067
Jenson, and why is she here?

683
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:57,208
Do not want to know? The unstoppable force
unknown? Yeti or alien or...

684
00:43:57,226 --> 00:44:00,274
One superman designed by the Soviets?

685
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,003
I want to know what is
and the answer is behind the door,

686
00:44:04,004 --> 00:44:07,276
Then could help me, please?

687
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,476
Okay?

688
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:19,220
Expected.

689
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,146
Is now open,

690
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:31,685
but is frozen, it seems.

691
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:36,692
Well, it means that we can open up
derretermos ice.

692
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:40,553
- Let's call them and get hot water.
- No, Jesus...

693
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:44,071
- Why not...
- Why?

694
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,782
You want to go here...
This will only scare them more...

695
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,092
And do not want to change
the camping, okay? So...

696
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,680
Count tomorrow

697
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:56,919
now and then we come back, okay?

698
00:45:14,806 --> 00:45:16,717
Hey, guys!
What's up?

699
00:45:16,718 --> 00:45:19,034
- Let's go to bed?
- Sure.

700
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:21,526
Good night.

701
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,890
- Goodnight, Holly.
- Good evening.

702
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,756
Good night, guys.

703
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,947
What are you reading?

704
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:35,354
Slaughterhouse 5.

705
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:38,492
- Do not like Vonnegut?
- I love this book.

706
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:41,177
- I thought of him yesterday.
- Good.

707
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,229
I'm impressed!

708
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:46,165
- Sit, teacher.
- Thank you.

709
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,957
Just take it from here...

710
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,219
Yes, impossible to heat

711
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:04,258
when sitting in snow all the time.

712
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:07,672
I think my ass will not know when
crap.

713
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:13,485
- They found something with the Geiger counter?
- Not totally clean.

714
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,063
Good,

715
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:19,298
I think, I mean,
hope you find something to your movie.

716
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:21,320
Still have time?

717
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,483
Love young.

718
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,006
Hope you're right that...

719
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:36,075
Thatcher is a nice guy, but not
concerning boyfriend.

720
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,211
What?
I think he's cute.

721
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:43,307
Speaks master to stay on track.

722
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,283
Staying on track?

723
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:48,095
Yes, let me see, man,

724
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,220
Stay in camping,
a track in the middle of nowhere

725
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:56,559
especially when it's cold
and the girl needs caress.

726
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:59,123
A romantic, my God!

727
00:46:59,137 --> 00:47:01,782
- Not the worst.
- He has herpes?

728
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:05,460
This is not, not.

729
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,883
Know the camera on the phone?

730
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:10,304
Oh, no!
It records?

731
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:14,469
Not only is the map panorama reliable,
is also the head by the camera.

732
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,340
No, Denise.

733
00:47:16,363 --> 00:47:18,252
She will fall.

734
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:22,152
And you, what is your tactic?

735
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:28,185
Te present to my only friend

736
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:30,029
"Colonel Whisky".

737
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:32,717
- Hello, sir.
- Yes, please.

738
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:35,048
John Patrick Hauser,

739
00:47:35,072 --> 00:47:37,698
're trying to get me drunk?

740
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,851
Is the easiest way to get
paradoxical undressing.

741
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,402
Cool.

742
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:53,580
- Can you believe that?
- Not power, it's just a flirt on track.

743
00:47:53,596 --> 00:47:56,843
- Just a flirt on track?
- 'Re Filming, Hauser said.

744
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:01,329
I'm not sure...
This sequence wet.

745
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:05,320
Lucile Whenever we call, right?

746
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:07,641
Hey man, you laugh but...

747
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:11,524
If shoot this illegal in the
state of Oregon, then...

748
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,514
I would not, but unfortunately there is
,

749
00:48:14,537 --> 00:48:17,786
so I have to maintain a
professional relationship she

750
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:19,822
mostly.

751
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:36,588
Well, I'm going...

752
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:39,716
- I'll sleep.
- Okay.

753
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,796
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

754
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:46,509
Sweet dreams.

755
00:48:54,095 --> 00:48:57,507
Sorry for accusing him of faking
footprints.

756
00:48:57,531 --> 00:49:02,438
Okay. Do not know if it was fake, then
thought the same thing.

757
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:05,528
I jumped into a conclusion unwarranted.

758
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:09,268
Hoped that hit me,
but you good people.

759
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:14,036
Well, if you want to apologize...

760
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:18,170
Such warm me with a caress?

761
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,649
- Really?
- Yes

762
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:24,839
Yes

763
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:31,364

764
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:33,944
guess is...
The third day

765
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:38,634
and we know Denise.

766
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:58,315
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

767
00:49:58,337 --> 00:50:01,577
- Our own movie.
- Ready again?

768
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:03,508
Why are you so surprised?

769
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:05,827
Surprised me,
with the explosion.

770
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:08,236
Explosion?

771
00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:11,415
Turn it off!

772
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:13,659
- What?
- Turn! Off! No!

773
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,045
'll Say I never did
sex at the camera?

774
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,024
- Andy!
- Oh, wait, that's part of the show.

775
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:20,627
I have to admit it?

776
00:50:20,628 --> 00:50:22,618
- You'll have to admit...
- Andy!

777
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,928
Shit!

778
00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:36,050

779
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,513
- What is it?
- Hear that? - Yes!

780
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:41,394

783
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:48,195
What the hell is that?

784
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,907
Shit!

785
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,699
- Denise! My God, out soon!
- Guys!

786
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,334
Denise, get up!

787
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,836

788
00:50:58,165 --> 00:50:59,796

799
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:51,967
Denise died.

800
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,272
No way, man,

801
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,211

802
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,417
- I'm sorry.
- She died.

803
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:09,547

00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:18,912

00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,353
Wake up, man! They tried to kill us and

809
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,417

00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:34,093

- Do not know what happened!
- What!

813
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:41,627
Anyone discovers this,

815

can not believe Denise died, but true

824
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:14,528
Now we have to pull ourselves together,
and focus on not losing anyone else.

825
00:53:14,546 --> 00:53:18,400
- Andy, what do we do?
- My first aid kit.

826
00:53:23,727 --> 00:53:26,179

842
00:54:09,427 --> 00:54:13,416
- I can not, JP!
- It's okay. Leave it to me.

843
00:54:13,975 --> 00:54:16,627
Not bad as she said, is only...

844
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:19,984
Jenson, take a twig or
something to use as a splint.

845
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,839
- No, no, no!
- Not so bad, it'll be fine.

846
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:27,192
'll Be fine, I promise I will...

847
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,763
This will hurt a bit

848
00:54:30,778 --> 00:54:34,120
Have to replace it...
Have to replace it now!

849
00:54:34,928 --> 00:54:36,330
- Ready?

850
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:38,141

851
00:54:38,162 --> 00:54:40,309
- Three breaths, okay?
- Yes

852
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:42,436
- Are you ready?
- Make logo!

853
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,159
Okay, on three.

854
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:45,440
Okay?
A...

855
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,668
It was not so bad.
It was not so bad.

856
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:51,207
Not for you!

857
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:54,152
- I'm sorry, it's over.
- Not! - Okay.

858
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,626
- Okay.
- This thing're on?

859
00:55:01,642 --> 00:55:04,104
Off,
do not want them to see me like this...

860
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:15,244
This does not work!

861
00:55:15,262 --> 00:55:18,187
I paid for the international plan.

862
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:22,344
This is stupid! We need help, we turn
flags.

863
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,209
- If we see who did it...
- Nobody... did it!

864
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,708
I do not know, JP, maybe
Jenson is right.

865
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:29,732
No!

866
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:36,103
So Andy took the plunge and
bag is too far for someone to see us!

867
00:55:37,818 --> 00:55:39,859
Gotta same record?

868
00:55:39,891 --> 00:55:44,103
No matter the end of it, I
record what happens to us

869
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:47,894
not done so as
Dyatlov another mystery.

870
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:52,544
If we do that, we can ask for help before
?

871
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:55,916
I do not think we can carry Andy.

872
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:57,971
What is this?

873
00:55:57,985 --> 00:56:00,003
- What?
- That look...

874
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,786
What the hell is happening?

875
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:09,108
We found something with the Geiger counter.

876
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:14,461
What do you think?

877
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:17,548
A port.

878
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:20,128
What?

879
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:25,498
Freezing in the damn snow all day
and says he has a fucking bunker here?

880
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:30,132
But we can not open,
radiation is... strong.

881
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:34,858
How strong?

882
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,999
It is not dangerous, but...

883
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,815
Unbelievable!

884
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:49,152
Planted footprints?

885
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:52,189
No!
Do not planted footprints.

886
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:54,302
Not believe.

887
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:57,197
Great, not believe me.

888
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,397
Okay,

889
00:57:07,569 --> 00:57:11,289
if someone started this avalanche,
reason is there, right?

890
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:12,611
Yes

891
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:18,455
Light up the flags, so people will
will not have chance to kill us.

892
00:57:18,837 --> 00:57:20,842
Okay.

893
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:36,276
Come on!

894
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:42,972
What?

895
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:46,848
Orange lights in the sky.

896
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,689
JP, I'm sorry,

897
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:56,946
should have told you

898
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,791
but they were so concerned
with the compass, and...

899
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:02,826
With the map, and...

900
00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:07,076
And did not want anything to happen that
.

901
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:12,510
Yes ..

902
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:16,124
Follow step by step how
they killed nine people,

903
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:18,784
what you thought would happen?

904
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:20,887
I do not know.

905
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,518
I just...

906
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:33,022
Always felt attracted to this place

907
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:36,943
do not know why,
can not explain.

908
00:58:39,051 --> 00:58:41,056
I do not want that.

909
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:46,630
Do you think anyone will see the flags?

910
00:58:47,268 --> 00:58:49,037
I do not know.

911
00:58:49,952 --> 00:58:54,383
If to freeze here,
opened that door with radiation or not, ok?

912
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:56,200
Yes

913
00:58:56,218 --> 00:58:58,047
Okay.

914
00:58:58,072 --> 00:59:02,079
Want blueberry pancakes
or Macaroni and Cheese?

915
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:04,950
Have to eat blueberries for breakfast...

916
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,818
To grow.

917
00:59:06,831 --> 00:59:08,344
Hey, Jenson!

918
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:11,242
- What is it?
- Hey, man...

919
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,793
Sorry for Denise

920
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,531
true, think what you want
, but sorry.

921
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:21,192
Yes, me too.

922
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:25,793
Oh, shit!
Someone is coming, look!

923
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:27,936
Help!

924
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:30,660
We need help!

925
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:34,947
We saw the flags!
Are you well?

926
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,822
Our friend got hurt.

927
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:41,258
- No, look, it's a lie.
- What?

928
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:43,780
Are no backpacks,
as they arrived so fast?

929
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:46,752
- Are following us.
- I said, detonated the explosives.

930
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:48,249
- Who?
- The military!

931
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:50,496
- Go, go, now!

00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:52,495

- Help load!
- I'll get it, we will.

934
00:59:54,702 --> 00:59:57,583
- I can not go anywhere!
- One, two, three.

935
00:59:57,602 --> 00:59:59,120
Okay!

936
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:00,368
- I can not...
- Shit!

937
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,261
Can not go, can not, will!

938
01:00:02,262 --> 01:00:03,422
Go Now!

939
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:05,419

01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,714
We need to go now!

944
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:19,799
- Come on!
- I will not!

945
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:22,354
- JP, come on!
- We have to go!

01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:25,523

Come on, Holly!

956
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,480
Arise!

957
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:02,403
- Open the door.
- Shit! Shit! Shit!

958
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:04,043
Opens!

959
01:01:04,054 --> 01:01:06,900
It is open only froze shut.

960
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:08,924
Guys!
Guys!

961
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,222

01:01:13,245 --> 01:01:15,590
Opened enters!

963
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:18,625
Come!

964
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:23,189
- Holly!
- Close the door, close the damn door

965
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:27,154
Lock!

966
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:30,264
Bolt on the other side,
and they have closed!

967
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:32,720
- My God locked us!
- JP?

968
01:01:32,738 --> 01:01:34,071
- Yes?
- You okay?

969
01:01:34,072 --> 01:01:35,848
No, I'm bleeding a lot.

970
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:37,739
Press the injury.

971
01:01:38,645 --> 01:01:40,859
- It's okay.
- Stop for a second.

972
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:43,685
Take the camera,
light on camera.

973
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,331
Good.

974
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:51,149
Okay, got it!

975
01:01:52,284 --> 01:01:54,287
Oh, God!

976
01:01:54,307 --> 01:01:56,751
What do you see?

977
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,454
Is a tunnel!

978
01:01:59,478 --> 01:02:02,255
- What?
- We're in a tunnel.

979
01:02:09,068 --> 01:02:10,871
Okay.

980
01:02:17,363 --> 01:02:19,332
What do you see?

981
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:23,903
An alternator...
Alternator power.

982
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,674
- League!
- Okay.

983
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:37,160
- Works.
- Thank God! - Right.

984
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:39,525
- Should lock the door.
- Why?

985
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:42,509
Why lock yourself out,
can come whenever you want.

986
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,183
No one will enter, face,
is wasted forces.

987
01:02:45,184 --> 01:02:47,702
- Is an emergency...
- Looked around?

988
01:02:47,703 --> 01:02:50,518
No one will come to save us.

989
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,996
We are on our own!

990
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:56,289
They know that in a few
days we will dehydrate

991
01:02:56,303 --> 01:02:59,656
and not have to worry
with any of us.

992
01:03:00,478 --> 01:03:05,472
Then just lock themselves
the door and come back in a week.

993
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,959
Unless if we find an exit.

994
01:03:07,973 --> 01:03:10,499
- Can you walk?
- Yes

995
01:03:10,517 --> 01:03:13,414
- Okay.
- Beware, beware.

996
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,274
Shit!

997
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:18,512
Okay.

998
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:21,446
- Let's rectum.
- Okay.

999
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:25,551
- Jenson, stay close.
- Okay.

1000
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:28,135
Slowly, slowly.

1001
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,603
Okay,

1002
01:03:37,631 --> 01:03:39,658
better take a break.

1003
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:48,364
Shit, shit!
Another tunnel, another tunnel.

1004
01:03:49,378 --> 01:03:50,882
JP, JP...

1005
01:03:51,382 --> 01:03:52,889
What?
What is it?

1006
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,455
What?

1007
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:58,021
I felt something.

1008
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,672
What?

1009
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,998
There's something here!

1010
01:04:02,016 --> 01:04:04,576
- Follow.
- There's something here, Jenson, I swear!

1011
01:04:04,577 --> 01:04:06,379
There's nobody here, Holly!

1012
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:08,228
Come on!

1013
01:04:10,189 --> 01:04:11,695
Shit!

1014
01:04:11,718 --> 01:04:14,377
- Which way?
- Left.

1015
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:17,601
- Take it easy. Do not stop, do not stop.
- Right.

1016
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,913
The lights are still here.

1017
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:23,646
- Stay close.
- Okay.

1018
01:04:23,661 --> 01:04:25,202
Shit.

1019
01:04:25,215 --> 01:04:27,668
- Not very fast.
- Right.

1020
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,019
Jesus!

1021
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:44,250
What is this place?

1022
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,853
Is a...

1023
01:04:45,868 --> 01:04:47,901
Laboratory or type.

1024
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,660
Still is.

1025
01:04:50,674 --> 01:04:52,703
What happened here?

1026
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:54,714
Who will know?

1027
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:57,246
Sit down, let me see.

1028
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,245
Wait...

1029
01:04:59,258 --> 01:05:01,029
Here.

1030
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:02,913
Use this.

1031
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,600
I'll Be fine.

1032
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:12,424
Sorry.

1033
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:18,177
It will hurt a bit.

1034
01:05:29,734 --> 01:05:31,748
I found an opening.

1035
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,393
- Be careful.
- Yes, no problem.

1036
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:43,376
Look at this place.

1037
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,520
Holly, come here, look at this
.

1038
01:05:57,636 --> 01:06:01,071
- What is this!
- A thick book, I think.

1039
01:06:03,935 --> 01:06:05,693
I know that word.

1040
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,843
- Yes?
- Yes ..

1041
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:10,664
Saw her several times while researching.

1042
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:12,675
What is the meaning?

1043
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,665
Killed in combat.

1044
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:17,720
This all?

1045
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:19,810
Can you read something else?

1046
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:21,845
Only dates.

1047
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,887
1945.

1048
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,278
1959.

1049
01:06:27,511 --> 01:06:30,727
Year in which the explorers were killed
,

1050
01:06:30,746 --> 01:06:32,783
and then.

1051
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:39,975
What?
Is a boat.

1052
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,435
Is the Eldridge

1053
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,920
USS Eldridge,
the Philadelphia Experiment.

1054
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:48,185
Philadelphia Experiment?

1055
01:06:48,195 --> 01:06:51,230
Come on, live in the cave and such?

1056
01:06:51,904 --> 01:06:53,912
In 1943

1057
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:59,138
the U.S. Government made a
experiment with this ship.

1058
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,336
What kind of experiment?

1059
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:03,363
Teleportation.

1060
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:05,262
Oh my God!

1061
01:07:05,276 --> 01:07:09,039
There are rumors of people
saw the carcass of the ship,

1062
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:11,808
but no one has ever seen
anything like this,

1063
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:15,166
type these photos are top-top-secret...

1064
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:18,368
Someone could be killed because of it.

1065
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:20,335
Oh God!

1066
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:22,146
Okay.

1067
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:24,071
Let's get out.

1068
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,970
- Yes
- JP, can walk?

1069
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:29,223
- No.
- Shit.

1070
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:32,957
I'm not leaving here, okay?
So think of something.

1071
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,026
Find a way out, okay?

1072
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:41,095
Okay, and then I'll go back and
carry you out, okay?

1073
01:07:41,453 --> 01:07:43,457
Come on!

1074
01:08:06,891 --> 01:08:08,938
Jesus Christ!

1075
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,848
Is a cave formed naturally...

1076
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:37,975
Do not know if the output is
seems a little wild.

1077
01:08:37,977 --> 01:08:40,099
Turned espeleólogo now?

1078
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:42,123
See it.

1079
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:46,556
Seems nuclear power for electricity
it has here.

1080
01:08:46,575 --> 01:08:50,723
Alexandrovich was here, which was picked
radiation.

1081
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,983
You have to have an outlet.

1082
01:08:57,127 --> 01:08:59,152
Caution!

1083
01:09:02,493 --> 01:09:04,499
Oh, my God!

1084
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,633
What is it?

1085
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,505
- Still works.
- Yes, give me that.

1086
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:31,893
I knew someone had been here.

1087
01:09:31,924 --> 01:09:33,785
Who is he?

1088
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,645
A military.

1089
01:09:36,985 --> 01:09:39,279
Why is he here?

1090
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:48,361
When killing five Americans want
to keep a secret buried for 50 years

1091
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:52,913
send someone to make sure
that the secret will be kept.

1092
01:09:56,773 --> 01:09:59,192
- What are you doing?
- Checking something.

1093
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,018
Shit!

1094
01:10:02,192 --> 01:10:05,652
A we found at
Meteorological Tower.

1095
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:08,174
Is his tongue?

1096
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:12,581
How did she get there?

1097
01:10:12,593 --> 01:10:14,613
Something must have started.

1098
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:16,816
So the door unlocked.

1099
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:20,982
Could be doing an experiment there?

1100
01:10:20,998 --> 01:10:23,728
He ​​said he has a lot of it in progress.

1101
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:25,487
My God!

1102
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:28,159
Holly,
looks at the bullet holes,

1103
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:30,183
this is not a laboratory,

1104
01:10:30,202 --> 01:10:32,319
is an execution chamber.

1105
01:10:32,335 --> 01:10:34,368
Oh God!

1106
01:10:35,345 --> 01:10:37,857
Holly, what is this?

1107
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:49,103
Seems one of the soldiers that book.

1108
01:10:58,747 --> 01:11:00,920
I do not understand.

1109
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:03,661
- Jenson!
- These things do not...

1110
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,542
Not appear normal.

1111
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,935
Maybe that's why we left here.

1112
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:17,305
What the hell is that?

1113
01:11:25,592 --> 01:11:27,592
Wait!

1114
01:11:27,613 --> 01:11:29,647
This door was not open.

1115
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,676
What is it?

1116
01:11:38,637 --> 01:11:40,654
Be careful!

1117
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,483
What is this?

1118
01:11:47,498 --> 01:11:49,234
JP?

1119
01:11:50,203 --> 01:11:51,916
God!

1120
01:11:57,673 --> 01:11:59,677
There's something here, Jenson.

1121
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:07,423
- Oh, no!
- My God!

1122
01:12:12,872 --> 01:12:16,873
-It's Blood?
- We gotta get out of here, okay?

1123
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:22,429
- What is it?
- I do not know.

1124
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:25,111
- A type of light?
- No lower.

1125
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:27,144
Let me see that.

1126
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:32,797
Is this the same camera, and still
battery. See what's on it.

1127
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,855
<i>- No recordings!
- Yeah, tell that to the camera</i>

1128
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,593
<i>- Go away, please!
- The Cold War is over, we're friends.</i>

1129
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:43,450
- I do not...
- Accelerate before the battery runs out.

1130
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:45,116
<i>He died.</i>

1131
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:52,012
Stop!

1132
01:12:52,044 --> 01:12:53,991
<i>See what's on it.</i>

1133
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:57,102
<i>- No recordings!
- Yeah, tell that to the cam...</i>

1134
01:12:57,574 --> 01:12:59,605
Shit!

1135
01:13:03,013 --> 01:13:05,026
This is impossible!

1136
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,929
No, maybe not...

1137
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:10,831
Remembers Eldridge,
the Philadelphia Experiment?

1138
01:13:10,832 --> 01:13:15,313
He ​​allegedly was teleported
from Philadelphia to Norfolk.

1139
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,396
- So what?
- So what...

1140
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:22,483
Reportedly arrived in Norfolk
10minutes before leaving Philadelphia.

1141
01:13:23,141 --> 01:13:25,660
I mean that is a
damn time machine?

1142
01:13:25,674 --> 01:13:30,384
No, I mean anyone,
elite scientists or the government,

1143
01:13:30,385 --> 01:13:32,824
none knows

1144
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:37,445
Nobody knows what is happening or has
notion of how fuck is this.

1145
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:41,488
Holly, all these experiments were abandoned
,

1146
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:47,303
Eldridge's crew, who not
fused to the deck, went crazy,

1147
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:50,894
suffered some...
Change...

1148
01:13:50,912 --> 01:13:53,299
Mutations...

1149
01:13:53,314 --> 01:13:56,244
People do not mention these things.

1150
01:13:57,074 --> 01:13:58,936
JP!

1151
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:03,357
Jenson, come on!

1152
01:14:03,597 --> 01:14:05,404
Come on!

1153
01:14:09,686 --> 01:14:11,487
JP!

1154
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:26,121
Jenson!

1155
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,700
Jenson!

1156
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:38,508
What are you doing?
Get out there.

1157
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:11,801
- Where were they?
- Go back to get me.

1158
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:14,456
Control yourself,
recompose now!

1159
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:35,341
- JP!
- Come!

1160
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:39,765
On the ceiling, the ceiling!

1161
01:15:39,783 --> 01:15:41,550
Jenson!

1162
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:43,598
- Jesus Christ!
- Jenson!

1163
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:48,594
- From where?
- I do not know.

1164
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,824
Look, it's up there!

1165
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,172
- Jenson, where he was?
- I do not know!

1166
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,828
- Where was he?
- Catch the JP!

1167
01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:04,770
Jenson!

1168
01:16:08,169 --> 01:16:11,361
Let him out the door and ran after
, understood?

1169
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:12,949
Understood!

1170
01:16:15,554 --> 01:16:18,544
- Run! - Beware!
- Go, go!

1171
01:16:18,978 --> 01:16:20,617
- Over here!
- Come on!

1172
01:16:20,953 --> 01:16:22,696
Run!
Go!

1173
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:25,048
Jenson, here!

1174
01:16:52,894 --> 01:16:55,989
Because let us run?
Why not prevented?

1175
01:16:56,014 --> 01:17:01,345
I do not know, we should be dead.
Do not kill us when they had a chance!

1176
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:14,870
What the hell is that?

1177
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,047
Like a giant fossil.

1178
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:32,791
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for us.

1179
01:17:33,747 --> 01:17:37,915
- JP! I said I would come back for him.
- It can not see what they did with it!

1180
01:17:37,923 --> 01:17:41,001
If we open the door, do the same with us
,

1181
01:17:41,016 --> 01:17:46,632
're trapped, and they know,
're exactly where they wanted.

1182
01:17:50,985 --> 01:17:53,729
- Holly saw that?
- Yes

1183
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:57,425
Do it again.

1184
01:18:06,377 --> 01:18:08,834
- She recorded this, right?
- Yes

1185
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:10,573
Good.

1186
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:13,940
I knew, I knew...

1187
01:18:14,748 --> 01:18:17,471
What!
- Teleportation.

1188
01:18:17,878 --> 01:18:21,570
Those creatures,
the way disappeared...

1189
01:18:21,586 --> 01:18:23,820
Were intangible,

1190
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:26,550
can teleport

1191
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:29,900
but not through these doors.

1192
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,232
Therefore lock from the outside.

1193
01:18:33,734 --> 01:18:38,131
There must be a connection between
those things and this place.

1194
01:18:48,588 --> 01:18:50,591
They came here,

1195
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,606
they came of it.

1196
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:54,488
Makes sense...

1197
01:18:54,502 --> 01:18:56,435
Type this is...

1198
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,054
A giant...

1199
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:00,154
"Wormhole"

1200
01:19:00,163 --> 01:19:01,919
type one...

1201
01:19:01,935 --> 01:19:03,785
Carrier.

1202
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:06,777
- How to get here?
- I do not know.

1203
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:14,605
Holly

1204
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:19,626
the Mansi, the natives, all
here for thousands of years,

1205
01:19:19,642 --> 01:19:24,277
Do not know how this thing works, but
is what they are trying to say.

1206
01:19:27,683 --> 01:19:30,306
So they built a teleporter?

1207
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:35,529
I do not know, maybe just found this thing
the cave and drew,

1208
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:39,062
it may be some kind of alien technology
,

1209
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,519
maybe try to turn into a weapon.

1210
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:45,668
And if there are more portals
like this in the world?

1211
01:19:45,684 --> 01:19:47,898
If these things come from within it...

1212
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,804
Explain all kinds of unsolved mysteries,

1213
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:54,733
the Eldridge, the appearances of
the Mothman in Point Pleasant,

1214
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,812
'll know what else!

1215
01:20:00,214 --> 01:20:03,447
- The flashlight was already.
- Shit.

1216
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:06,514
- Jenson, I see nothing!
- Okay, stay with me.

1217
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:09,435
Here you are.
Watch your step. Okay.

1218
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:13,970
Without opening the door, not in
reach if we sit here, okay?

1219
01:20:13,971 --> 01:20:16,140
Got it?
Right.

1220
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:26,010
Happened...

1221
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:28,637
What?

1222
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:32,405
I opened the door and darkness
followed me, and in my dream.

1223
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:34,550
Hey, come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

1224
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:38,083
- It was just a dream, just a dream.
- Excuse me.

1225
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:41,295
Jenson, never leave here.

1226
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,554
Sorry.

1227
01:21:30,963 --> 01:21:32,997
The camera is connected?

1228
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:35,770
- I see the light.
- Yes

1229
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,322
Okay.

1230
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:43,342
I have an idea.

1231
01:21:44,493 --> 01:21:47,668
Enough with the old game, Jenson,
are spending battery.

1232
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,266
No.

1233
01:21:50,502 --> 01:21:52,516
The portal...

1234
01:21:55,005 --> 01:21:59,295
What about"
holes that bend the space time continuum

1235
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:03,009
and cause panic in the human brain"?

1236
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:05,051
This is my plan...

1237
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:07,892
See?

1238
01:22:09,773 --> 01:22:11,845
No controls...

1239
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:14,605
Has no buttons...

1240
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:20,321
Which means that it takes
you somewhere specific...

1241
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:22,982
Or anywhere.

1242
01:22:23,663 --> 01:22:25,525
Nowhere.

1243
01:22:25,539 --> 01:22:27,555
What I think too.

1244
01:22:28,886 --> 01:22:31,390
But what if...
You...

1245
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:33,303
Fix a place

1246
01:22:33,313 --> 01:22:35,485
clearly in mind,

1247
01:22:35,871 --> 01:22:40,161
you concentrate,
so to there that takes you.

1248
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:45,225
As they say, there's no place like home
us, it's easy.

1249
01:22:45,236 --> 01:22:47,242
Yes, easy.

1250
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:53,692
And let's not blow
the mountains and such?

1251
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:57,157
Do not know hope not.

1252
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,607
We will die here, Jenson.

1253
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:11,568
This is it...

1254
01:23:12,831 --> 01:23:14,896
Or laboratory.

1255
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:20,739
Okay.

1256
01:23:21,339 --> 01:23:23,397
What do we do?

1257
01:23:26,407 --> 01:23:29,156
It will tell you what we'll do,

1258
01:23:31,154 --> 01:23:36,896
but I think there should be a place
fresh in his memory,

1259
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,179
somewhere close by,

1260
01:23:39,195 --> 01:23:43,106
A place whose image is in your mind.

1261
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,389
Outside the mountain.

1262
01:23:47,305 --> 01:23:49,374
Tells the other side of the door?

1263
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,841
It's the most fresh in our minds,

1264
01:23:51,863 --> 01:23:54,319
and now that the door is closed
,

1265
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:57,471
protects us from those things, right?

1266
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,796
Okay.

1267
01:24:05,548 --> 01:24:07,328
Okay.

1268
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,944
I'm scared!

1269
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:55,432
"It's all right, and everybody has to
do exactly what he does"

1270
01:24:56,297 --> 01:24:58,171
Where is it?

1271
01:24:58,201 --> 01:25:00,535
Slaughterhouse 5.

1272
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:04,360
Never read.

1273
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:10,271
So here we go.

1274
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,579
Other bodies.

1275
01:25:45,962 --> 01:25:48,000
Vallik!

1276
01:25:48,026 --> 01:25:52,096
But I think all the tourists!
Who are they?

1277
01:25:52,455 --> 01:25:54,462
- Stay away!
- She heard him move away!

1278
01:25:54,463 --> 01:25:56,645
- Stop!
- We did not do anything!

1279
01:25:56,668 --> 01:26:00,242
- We just wanted to help.
- Alright...

1280
01:26:00,253 --> 01:26:08,141
The army declared quarantine
this site to find out what happened...

1281
01:26:08,142 --> 01:26:12,052
Return with others to the city, please.

1282
01:26:12,053 --> 01:26:14,122
- Go!
- Okay.

1283
01:26:23,418 --> 01:26:25,683
What are you doing?

1284
01:26:25,706 --> 01:26:29,702
How will discover what happened if
are removing everything?

1285
01:26:29,703 --> 01:26:31,710
- C'mon, Alya!
- Listen to the...

1286
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:35,477
He knows what is best for you,
the situation is under our control.

1287
01:26:35,496 --> 01:26:38,827
Do not even know who they are.

1288
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:14,896
Rest.

1289
01:27:24,111 --> 01:27:26,178
Left.

1290
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:34,936
Rest.

1291
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:50,129
- What are you doing?
- Placing them with others.

1292
01:27:50,152 --> 01:27:53,957
No, no. Dr. Miktenko
will want to look these.

1293
01:27:53,976 --> 01:27:59,103
- Let them separate.
- Why? They are the same from others.

1294
01:27:59,136 --> 01:28:01,145
Come on!

1295
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:26,369
Look at these clothes,

1296
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:29,142
never seen anything like this in life.

1297
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:35,884
Put away them fast, fast!

1298
01:28:35,885 --> 01:28:37,956
Okay.

1299
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:45,353
Hang them!

1300
01:29:04,615 --> 01:29:07,379
- Who are they?
- Perhaps the group Dyatlov.

1301
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,588
- Made a mistake coming here.
- No matter,

1302
01:29:10,607 --> 01:29:14,634
hurry, let's get out of here.

1303
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:20,000
I hate this place,
gives me chills.

1304
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,901
Also in 2013, the world's
leading scientists

1305
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:56,990
are still unable to explain what
happened to the group Dyatlov.

1306
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:01,819
But there are those who believe
that the answers are there,

1307
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:06,196
buried under snow and rocks,
waiting to be found...
