{\an8}[Elle] <i>Well, after graduation,</i>

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:24,541
{\an8}<i>Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided
to take one week and go on a road trip,</i>

5
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,125
{\an8}<i>just the four of us.</i>

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,791
{\an8}<i>And while I was busy putting off
the inevitable decision</i>

7
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,791
{\an8}<i>between the two colleges
where I got accepted…</i>

8
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
{\an8}[Lee] So, what about you?

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,000
{\an8}I... I got wait-listed.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,666
{\an8}Both Berkeley and Harvard.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,666
{\an8}<i>I was fully focused on making sure
we all had as much fun as possible.</i>

12

{\an8}- [shouts]
- [Elle] <i>And that's exactly what we did.</i>

{\an8}<i>Let me run you through the highlights.</i>

14
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,583
{\an8}<i>On our way up to Northern California,
we camped in the woods.</i>

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,708
{\an8}- [Lee] Hey!
- [Elle] <i>Went fishing on a lake.</i>

16
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,791
{\an8}<i>Fed some wildlife,
caught some waves at Big Sur.</i>

17
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,958
{\an8}<i>Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

18
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,541
{\an8}<i>Watched Lee watch Noah
becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

19
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,583
{\an8}<i>Watched a shooting star
with someone special.</i>

20
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,666
{\an8}Oh, my God!

21
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,000
{\an8}<i>Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.</i>

22
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,666
{\an8}<i>Saw a sunset with colors
I had never seen before.</i>

23
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,250
{\an8}<i>And got a reminder</i>
<i>about rule number 19. </i>[sighs]

24
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,416
{\an8}<i>Decided to think about it later.</i>

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,083
{\an8}<i>- Drove to San Francisco.</i>
- [bell ringing]

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,583
{\an8}<i>Went to Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

{\an8}[chuckles] <i>Destroyed our naughty video</i>
<i>from chemistry lab.</i>

31

{\an8}<i>- Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park.</i>
- [laughing]

32
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,208
[Elle]<i> Rode a speedboat in the bay.</i>

33
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,958
{\an8}<i>- Caught a movie.</i>
- [laughing]

34
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,333
{\an8}<i>- Caught a concert.</i>
- [cheering]

35
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,375
{\an8}[Elle] <i>Even caught a baseball</i>
<i>in a kayak outside Oracle Park…</i>

36
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,541
{\an8}Whoa, whoa!

37
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,208
{\an8}- [Lee] It's coming!
- I got it! [gasps]

38
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,333
{\an8}- Whoa.
- [Lee] Whoa!

39
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,166
{\an8}- [stadium fans cheering]
- Oh, my God!

40
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,875
{\an8}Oh, my God!

41
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,958
{\an8}<i>But the absolute best
was watching the Bay Lights</i>

42
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,708
{\an8}<i>with my favorite two guys in the world.</i>

43
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,125
{\an8}<i>But when you decide to escape reality,</i>

44
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,750
{\an8}<i>you know that eventually
you're gonna have to come back to it.</i>

45
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,666
{\an8}<i>So, when we got back home,</i>

46
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,666
{\an8}<i>I got a job so I could make some money
for college,</i>

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,541
{\an8}<i>whichever one I wind up going to.</i>

48
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,458
{\an8}Oh, hey, guys…

49
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,708
{\an8}<i>But as hard as that was for me to decide,</i>

50
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,458
{\an8}<i>a few days later</i>,
<i>things got even more complicated</i>

51
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,208
{\an8}<i>when Noah asked
a very unexpected question…</i>

52
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,125
Mmm!

53
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,208
So, anyway, I was thinking, uh…

54
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,611
when you get off the wait-list
for Harvard, maybe you and I

55
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,625
could go off-campus
and get an apartment together.

56
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,416
Wait. You mean, like…
like, get our own place?

57
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,750
Yeah, look. [clears throat]

58
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,958
I've been online all day.
There's some pretty cool places.

59
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,791
What?

60
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,458
- You wanna live with me?
- No.

61
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,125
[laughs] Yes, of course I wanna live
with you. I wanna do everything with you.

62
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,208
- Really?
- Yes, really.

63
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,166
- How long do we have till Lee gets back?
- I don't know.

64
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
[Elle sighs, laughs]

65
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,166
Geronimo!

66
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,166
- No, no, no, no, no, no! [screams]
- [Noah] Oh, shit!

67
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,666

- Ooh!

Is everything okay?

74
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,083
Yeah, fine.

75
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,000
- Um, in fact…
- Hmm.

[whispers]

77
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,684
- Yes, I would like that very much.
- Yeah, I thought you might.

78
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,500
- See you.
- Where are you two going?

79
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,458
Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry
and tell me all about his feelings.

80
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,684
- Really? Is that what you wanna go with?
- [clattering]

- [Lee] Smooth move!

82

[laughs]

83
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,125
Oh, I wanted to show this to you.

84
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,291
[Rachel] What is it?

85
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
I have painstakingly coordinated
my Berkeley schedule

86
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,333
with your Rhode Island School of Design
schedule.

87
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,267
- [Rachel] Aww.
- First up, we've got Labor Day.

88
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,166
I know it's early in the semester,
but it's a long weekend,

89
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,708
and I'm pretty damn sure
I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.

90
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,208
That could work.

91
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,083
Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.

92
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,541
[Rachel] Okay.

93
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
This place is so nice.
Thank you for bringing us here.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,541
Well, we wanted
to finally take you somewhere special

95
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,500
to help celebrate your graduation.

96
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,333
So, any big plans for the summer?

97
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,250
Well, actually, now that you mention it,

98
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,333
we were all talking about heading over
to the beach house this weekend,

99
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,708
if that's cool.

100
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
Is everything okay?

101
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,583
Yeah, everything's fine.
Um, we just have some news for you.

102
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,000
We are planning to sell the beach house.

103
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,833
[all] What?!

104
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,208
It doesn't make sense
to hold on to it anymore.

105
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,541
Now that you kids
are going off to college.

106
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
You know, the upkeep
on the place is hardly worth it

107
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,500
since we're not even gonna be there.

108
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,166
Truth is
the whole area is being redeveloped.

109
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,083
You know what you sound like, Mom?
You sound like a realtor.

110
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,041
That's because I <i>am</i> a realtor.

111
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,625
Wait, so where are we gonna watch
the fireworks on the Fourth of July?

112
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,308
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
You guys are not selling.

113
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
I gotta go with Lee on this one.

114
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,250
This house has been in our family
for, like, 80 years.

115
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,416
You can't just get rid of it like that.

116
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,541
Is this a vote? Because I vote "no."

117
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,125
I'm sorry, guys.

118
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,875
It's been decided.

119
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,000
- [sighs]
- [cell phone vibrating]

120
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,875
I'll be right back.

121

124
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,875
Uh, yes. Hi.

125
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,166
Um, is there any way
I could just get another small extension?

126
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,958
<i>I'm very sorry, Miss Evans,</i>

127
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,041
<i>but we need your decision
by end of business day tomorrow.</i>

128
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,250
[Elle] <i>I knew that I couldn't hide</i>
<i>from it any longer.</i>

129
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,875
Uh, okay. I understand.

130
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,291
- Thank you.
- [Don] <i>All right.</i>

131
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,250
[Elle] <i>The next day,</i>
<i>I had to pick a school</i>

I'ma hit you with a "draw four,"
"draw two." Uno, Uno out.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,458
- [Mr. Evans] Oh, no!
- What? Gosh!

135
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,958
Let's go. [grunts]

136
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,625

- [Brad] Unh-unh.

137
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,291
- [laughing]
- Aww. I miss this.

00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,208
I feel like I barely see you guys anymore.

139
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,625
Yeah, I know.

140
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,875
- They're keeping you busy at work.
- Very busy.

141
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,291
But don't worry,
I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.

142
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,750
Do you think you're gonna be working
a lot of weekends with this new job?

143
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,875
Uh, yeah, looks that way.

144
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,833
Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.

145
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,208

- Really?
- Yeah.

Um, how many dates have you been on
with this mystery person?

149
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,041
A few. Her name is Linda.

150
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,000
Interesting.

151
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, obviously, we,

152
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,208
Brad, are gonna have
to give you a curfew, young man.

153
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,000

00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,125
- Uh, yeah, no, uh, we actually could.
- Wow!

221
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,500
So, how long does it usually take
to sell a house out here?

222
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,458
Well, we have to put it on the market,

223
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,625
but, you know, maybe two or three months.

224
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,666
That's gonna be a real hassle
running out here all the time, though.

225
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,791
What do you mean?

226
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,416
Well, we have to meet with the appraisers,

227
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,125
surveyors, contractors
and the people looking to buy the place.

228
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,500
Well, gee,
that does sound like a real hassle.

229
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,916
Yeah, especially, you know,
with all the road work that's coming up.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,750
I mean that traffic on the freeway,
back and forth and back and forth

231
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,541
and back and forth.

232
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,225
[Elle] Not to mention all that cleaning.

233
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,541
And constantly driving up
to check on the work that's being done.

00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,583
Okay, what are you kids getting at?

235

I am so glad that you asked,
dear parent of mine.

236

Since this is our last summer here
at the beach house,

237
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,708
and since, like you said,

238
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,208
you're gonna need someone here,
help coordinating some stuff.

239
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,583
We would be more than happy
to stay here for you.

240
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,041
But we would take
amazing care of the place.

241
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,750
So, what do you say?

242
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,208
- We'll talk about it.
- [gasps] That's a yes! Ha ha ha!

502
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,208
I've got some recommendations for you.

503
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,041
- Hey.
- Hey.

504
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,250
Sorry for the weirdness earlier.

505
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,513
[chuckles] Oh, gosh. Don't worry about it.

506
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,583
I hope things can be cool for us,

507
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,666
since we'll probably run into each other
around here.

508
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,208
Of course it can. Yeah.

509
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,708
Um, are you hanging out
at the beach this summer?

510
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,083
Yeah, I just got a job lifeguarding
at the water park.

511
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,833
Oh, cool. Wait, wait, wait. Is that
the one with the giant go-kart track?

512
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,208
That is the one.

513
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,458
Interesting.

514
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,625
Um, question…

515
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,625
[cell phone rings]

516
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,166
Hey.

517
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,583
Hey, loser. What you up to?

518
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,416
[clicks tongue]
Uh, just doing some apartment hunting.

519
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,250
Good. Your last place smelled
like weird old cheese. [laughs]

520
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,166
<i>Okay, so listen.</i>

521
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,500
The fam are gonna be
in LA earlier than I thought.

522
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,083
Oh, that's great.
You should come by our place for a bit.

523
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,351
- <i>Come crash if you want.</i>
- Are you sure Elle won't mind?

524
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,666
Maybe you should ask her first.

525
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,250
No, it's okay.
We're in a pretty good place right now.

526
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,333
<i>I think it'll be good.</i>

527
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,000
Cool, cool, cool. You think
you can pick me up when I get in?

528
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,083
- Yeah, of course.
- <i>Perfect. I'll text you the address.</i>

529
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,541
Okay, bye.

530
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,458

531
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,208
[laughing]

532
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,500
That's why it's so funny.

533
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,125
Actually, um, you rushed out of the house
so... so quickly this afternoon.

534
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,142
I didn't...
I didn't get a chance to ask you. I...

535
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,250
I'm sorry.
I've had, like, a million things going on.

536
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,708
But, um, ask me what?

537
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,125
Well, Chloe's actually gonna be in town,

538
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:30,500
and I told her it would maybe be cool if
she wanted to stay at our place for a bit.

539
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,833
Is that okay with you?

540
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,583
Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, absolutely.

541
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,458
As far as I'm concerned,
that is... that's ancient history.

542
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,833
And she can come
with us to the... the water park.

543
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,416
What's the water park?

544
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,958
Okay, so, totally random.

545
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,267
I ran into Marco and his family
eating at the restaurant,

546
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,208
and he actually has a job
at the water park.

547
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,750
So he's gonna help us
with this cool bucket list thingy.

548
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,666
Oh, cool. Marco.

549
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,750
Wait, that's...

550
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:02,083
That's kind of a double standard.
I was totally fine with Chloe.

551
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,416
Well, I didn't kiss Chloe.

552
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,618
I didn't mean for that
to come out the way that it did.

553
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,041
I'm... I'm really sorry.

554
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,083
It's okay.

555
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,583
Let's just drop it, okay?

556
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,458
Okay, it's dropped. [chuckles]

557
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,541
[Elle] Okay.

558
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,125
- [chattering]
- [laughing]

559
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,375
- [Noah] I'm bored.
- [both laugh]

560
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,708
So you'll... you'll come to the water park?

561
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,916
- Yeah, yeah, I'll come.
- Okay.

562
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,041
And since you're going,

563
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,750
you can help Lee and I
with a bucket list item.

564
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:52,041
Oh, God. What... what is it?

565
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,750
What is the bucket list item?

566
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,250
- It's amazing.
- [chuckles] No.

567
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,000
- I'll let Lee fill you in.
- No.

568
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,208
And that's our epic plan for race day.

569
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,458
So, will you help us?

570
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,583
Absolutely not.

571
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,166
- Why the hell not?
- Look, Lee, I'm not gonna wear a costume.

572
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,416
I'll go, be there for Elle…

573
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,267
[chuckles] and whatever this, uh,
little mission is that you got going,

574
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,625
but, uh, that is it.

575

[groans]

576
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,416
You know, if you spent less time
worrying about your bucket list,

577
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
you might be able
to get that taillight fixed.

578
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,166
I like it busted! And screw you!

579
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,625
What?

580
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,500
Did you really expect him to do it?

581
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,503
Well, yeah, I thought that, you know,
maybe this time he would actually...

582
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,375
- [sighs] No, no, not really.
- [chuckles]

583
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:39,958
Well, hey, anyway,

584
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,250
I just wanna let you know how much fun
it is having you here while I'm working.

585
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,053
- But I do have one question.
- What's that?

586
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,666
What does a girl gotta do
to get water on table 17?

587
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,541
- Chop, chop!
- Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.

588
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,000
- [laughing]
- Hey, Lee.

589
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:52,958
[Lee] Hey!

590
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,541
- You ready to go?
- [Lee] Definitely.

591
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,916
Ready to go where?

592
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,083
I, uh, invited Ashton
to go to the, uh, the comic book show.

593
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,250
Cool.

594
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,253
You didn't wanna go to that, did you?
I could stay here if you need me to.

595
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,291
No, no. Gosh, no. I... I gotta...

596
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,458
[chuckles] Gotta work, so…

597
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:10,375
- I catch you later?
- Catch you later!

598

<i>Was I a total hypocrite or what?</i>

599
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,458
Bye. Have fun.

<i>This was my fault, after all.</i>

00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,541
<i>I was the one leaving Lee.</i>

602

<i>But even though I wanted
to be with Noah so badly,</i>

603

if I should've chosen Berkeley</i>

604

605
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,041
- Hey! What are you doing here?
- Hey!

606
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,101
Wanted to stop by and say I got everything
set up for you at the water park.

607
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,208
- No way! Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
- [chuckles]

608
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,333
No worries.

609
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,458
Is Noah helping out too?

610
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,125
[exhales] You know, typical Noah.

611
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,958
We couldn't get him to wear the costume,
but he'll be there.

612
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:48,416
Is he gonna have any problem
with me being there?

613
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,958
No, no, no.
It'll be totally fine. Don't worry.

What do you think
about coming down to the beach house

Yeah, maybe. Um, I... I...

01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,791

Elle and I broke up.

1679
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:12,208
I didn't want her
to make a decision she was gonna regret.

1680
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,960
You know,
but just 'cause we're not dating anymore

1681
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:17,166
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop protecting her.

1682
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:26,250
So, is she gonna go to Berkeley, or…

1683
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:34,541
No, actually.
She, uh, she's applying to USC.

1684
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,166
- She wants to do video game design.

about always needing to protect Elle.

It's not true.

1692

She's always been able
to take care of herself.

from you was…

1694

was for you to love her.
