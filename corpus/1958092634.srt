182
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,774
The Thane of Fife

183
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,049
is taken as our prisoner, and Menteith.

184
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,299
I dare believe we may have victory!

185
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,809
The Earl of Douglas
yet evades our grasp.

186
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,212
He slipped by me when last our armies met

187
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:09,581
at Otterburn, and left my brother dead.

188
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:11,205
[triumphant horn]

189
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:14,259
Good nephew, our knights
returning from their charge!

190
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,366
The Scottish lines are
broken; we have won!

191
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:17,915
Yet where is Douglas?

192
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,215
[percussion continues]

193
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:22,804
- I cannot make him out.
- But here's a friendly face!

194
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,179
- [man laughs charismatically]
- My brother Northumberland.

195
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,287
[percussion stops]

196
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,408
My boy, my boy!

197
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,571
Father! How stands the day?

198
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:32,678
My boy, the day is ours.

199
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,928
While watching from my
horse I saw thee fight

200
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,836
all glinting in the sun like mailèd Mars

201
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,749
thy voice like thunder
shook the startled birds

202
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,859
from every tree!

203
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,119
The rabbits hereabout

204
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,609
did dive into their burrows as in fear

205
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,489
that they beheld a second Hercules!

206
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,469
A knight who rode beside me did exclaim

207
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,559
the courage of, 'That warrior who strides

208
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,139
into a battle like the foaming sea

209
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,319
and parts it with defiant manly will!'

210
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,119
I with laughter

211
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,060
proudly turned and cried to all

212
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,549
'He is my son!'

213
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,000
Thou hast brought
honour to our family name!

214
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,129
Enough! These gilded
garments fit me not.

215
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,479
What of the Earl of Douglas? Where is he?

216
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,110
- [percussion]
- [Douglas struggling]

217
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:18,911
[percussion stops]

218
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:20,612
[Hotspur] Accursèd Scot!

219
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:23,259
Thou villain! Thou base thing!

220
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,498
Good morrow, Harry Percy.

221
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,879
And my lord?

222
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,442
I am Sir Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester

223
00:09:31,443 --> 00:09:33,661
the brother of the elder Henry here.

224
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:34,969
Oooh.

225
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,195
I see the landscape of Northumberland

226
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:40,382
makes Percys grow like dandelions: weeds

227
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,593
that are cut down and
then sprout up again.

228
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,469
You cut my brother Ralph down.

229
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,470
Aye, I did, when you were
but a stripling, years ago.

230
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,220
And now I am your prisoner.
[laughs tauntingly]

231
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,079
Not for long.

232
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,892
Father, lend me your sword.

233
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:00,969
[Douglas] Send me to
meet my cousin Archibald

234
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,849
who you dispatched today,
and we'll make hell

235
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,894
hold three prime places
for the Percy boys!

236
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:11,778
[sighs apprehensively]
Come, make it quick.

237
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,333
Make way there! In Prince
Henry's name make way!

238
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,391
[Douglas grunts]

239
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,819
Which of you untaught knaves, unmannerly

240
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,849
to top the basest varlet, ranks enough

241
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,159
among what out of London generously

242
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,739
are flattered with the name of gentlemen

243
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,929
to parlay with the issue of a King?

244
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,309
These untaught knaves,
my prince, have won the day

245
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,184
and at a Kingly cost vanquished the Scot!

246
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,359
Or were about to.

247
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,369
Nay, put up that sword!

248
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,719
Deliver any other prisoners

249
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,599
that you may have without ransom or delay.

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,029
I shall escort them South with every speed

251
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,309
to give them up unto my father's court.

252
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,779
It seems I am reprieved.

253
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,759
Not him: he's mine.

254
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,409
Read you this letter that a messenger

255
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,168
placed in my hands just moments hence.

256
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,818
The King, my father

257
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:07,660
[audience laughs]

258
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,149
gave this urgent task to me

259
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,159
charging that I instruct Northumberland.

260
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,366
The Scots surrendered not unto the King

261
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,702
but me! This is my field of victory!

262
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,670
Can I surrender for a second time?

263
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,251
- I do accept.
- [audience laughs]

264
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:23,085
No!

265
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,421
He has no command.

266
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:27,861
I have command by this crown that I wear

267
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,865
and by the blood I carry in my veins!

268
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,199
You have no knights
on this field, no army

269
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,839
you are no soldier, have
not stained your sword--

270
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,919
I marched from London
to be here with you

271
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,269
to oversee your lumpen, awkward war

272
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,839
braved villainous clouds
of salt-petre and soot

273
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,689
made blacker by egregious soldiers' oaths

274
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,019
and pricking marshland
flies which steal my blood

275
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,039
by pints and gallons!

276
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,202
Not so, my precious prince

277
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:59,739
you did not march here,
rather were you dragged

278
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,249
with lumpen awkward feet and dainty hands

279
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,159
sweet breath and neatly
polished fingernails

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,769
to sit in womanly idleness on your arse!

281
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,529
Then as the solider
here, you surely know

282
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,449
a soldier's duty is obedience!

283
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,679
And my duty shall I discharge at once

284
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,909
[snaps]
in taking of your prisoners.

285
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,196
One word more and I shall
count you with my prisoners!

286
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:25,209
This girlish tempest
temper quite exceeds

287
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,713
your savage reputation.

288
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,743
- Girlish?
- Ay.

289
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,376
Good nephew

290
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,760
cool the fire of your rage!

291
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,069
Have we not spoken many times of calm

292
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,989
and all the virtues that it brings a man?

293
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,330
There is my gauge!

294
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,709
Your hand would be advised

295
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,779
to sooner touch a venomous viper's tail

296
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,209
than such a certain
seal of vengeful death.

297
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,059
- My prince, take up your
gauge: enough have died

298
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,589
we need not have more bloodshed.

299
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,253
Come, let's talk.

300
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:53,087
Come.

301
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:54,667
[audience laughs]

302
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,253
Why 'girlish'? Wherefore
'girlish' sticks in me?

303
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,470
I am a man, no girl, that's certain!

304
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:06,430
Raugh!

305
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,779
[Jen] This is fucking coconuts.

306
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,053
- Sh!
- [audience laughs]

307
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,649
[whispers] Sit. Sit down, sit down.

308
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,869
The orders from the King are genuine.

309
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,209
Specifically the Earl of Douglas' name

310
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,099
is set down to be made a prisoner

311
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,231
and not the instrument of our revenge.

312
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:24,396
There's worse news in
the second letter here.

313
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:26,638
Thy brother in law, that's Edmund Mortimer

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,319
against the irregular and wild Glendower

315
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,383
was by the rude hands of
that Welshman captured.

316
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,339
Alas, that we should weigh our victory

317
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,519
in equal measure with such dark defeat

318
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,369
that celebration lights up all the North

319
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,943
while funeral darkness
shades the sullen South.

320
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,389
Then both my brothers now are lost to me.

321
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,669
Will neither be avenged?

322
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,113
Do not despair.

323
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,579
Our Ralph is gone, but taking our revenge

324
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,249
could never bid him walk out of his grave.

325
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,623
I miss him every day.

326
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,359
But I have found in time the
wound of grief becomes a scar

327
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,033
no longer bleeding but an old complaint.

328
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,889
I have one son still
breathing, and thy face

329
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,232
alive and smiling is more dear to me

330
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:21,134
than one more corpse left
out to feed the crows.

331
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:24,039
And as for Edmund Mortimer, he lives!

332
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,979
So as he lives we work to set him free.

333
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,219
I council that we keep our prisoner here

334
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,649
until King Henry is of such a mind

335
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,809
to ransom home our cousin who is lost.

336
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,609
I am content. We
shall exchange the Scot.

337
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,579
Unless you'd name Goliath as your second

338
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,249
the danger doth outweigh
your pride, my prince.

339
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,259
You have yourself seen my nephew think not

340
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,139
of gralloching a Scotsman in a stroke

341
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,779
or mangling a Welshman so entire

342
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,779
that Welsh alone has words savage enough

343
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,819
to sound description in an English ear.

344
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,059
I am familiar with your nephew's wrath.

345
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,549
How deep the currents
of passion run in him.

346
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,741
[Northumberland] Your royal highness

347
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:06,909
we propose a trade.

348
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,249
We will gladly give you
Douglas and the rest

349
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,149
if your father the King can make a vow

350
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,399
to ransom straight Edmund Mortimer

351
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,033
our cousin taken by the Welsh army.

352
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,736
I cannot promise on the King's behalf.

353
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:25,694
And yet I can on my own name, aye!

354
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,069
[snaps]
Yes!

355
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,879
This seems a friendly, even-handed suit.

356
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,204
I grant it, or I shall, yes, it is done!

357
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:36,038
I like it!

358
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,046
Silence, cur! Thou keep'st
thy head but temporarily.

359
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,409
So do we all.

360
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,839
Then I suggest we draw up the details

361
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,209
not in the frigid air but in my tent

362
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,331
where we can all repose
and ease ourselves.

363
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:52,479
Good nephew, we shall
parlay with the prince

364

365
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,490
When we have reached a
compact we will call.

366
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,149
Well fought today.

367
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,279
Our practise has borne fruit.

368
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,979
Thy swordsmanship is markedly improved.

369
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,453
I thank thee uncle.

370
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,259
The wounded cry for aid;
I'll see them cared for

371
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,669
and retrieve my sword.

372
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,909
Make sure that Douglas
is kept under guard.

373
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,240
I'll rest me in the warm
tent for a spell. [yawns]

374
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,453
My Prince!

375

In careless passion and faint breath

from many miles of marching have you let

377
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,373

negligently from your hand.

378
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,167
Oh!

380
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:55,929
I would we could be friends again, Harry.

381
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,449
This long campaign has been a taxing road

382
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,560
too often paved with bitter
tears and loss and...

383
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,339
And yet I am glad I came, for I met thee.

384
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:11,734

Thou, soldier!

388
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:30,825
Help me find my missing sword.

389

[hurried footsteps]

392
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,279
When I pursued the Douglas as he fled

393
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,429
I slipped into a bog and dropped my blade.

394
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,919
I think it landed somewhere hereabout.

395
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,259
I'll search this way,
and thou the other, so

396
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,089
we'll meet back in the middle.

397
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,998
Verily!

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,129
So uh, we're looking for a missing sword?

401
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,596
Is it special? Or um...

402
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,195
Generic sword-shaped?

403
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:01,319
[audience laughs]

404
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,685
What say'st thou? Hast
thou found the blasted thing?

405
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:05,682
No, no, I'm still looking!

406
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:08,034
Um, I would hate for you to
lose something like that.

407
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:10,638
Probably got lots of
beheadings to do with it.

408
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,443
My father gave it as a gift to me.

409
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:19,389
It was to mark the day I came of age

410
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,663
the day that I became...

411
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:23,570
A man.

412
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,635
I found it!

Thou hast a strange... Dialect.

I'm from Framlingham.

429
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,069
But I'm staying down the road
with some friends, actually.

430

Can I ask a question?

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,136
Why do you talk like that?

Do you speak that way

445
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,099
because it's genuinely how you think

446
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,367
or do you think that way

447
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,444

were taught to speak?

I've always spoken this way: it is hard...

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,035
Huh.

spill out undisciplined?

00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,570
Yeah. I mean, I guess, yeah.

but I remember, when the fight was done

720
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,439
when I was dry with rage and extreme toil

721
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,919
breathless and faint,
leaning upon my sword

722
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,501
came there, a certain lord

723
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:05,586
neat, and trimly dress'd

724
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:09,085
fresh as a bridegroom;
and his chin new reap'd

725
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:11,664
show'd like a stubble-land
at harvest-home.

726
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:16,183
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by

727
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,819
he call'd them untaught
knaves, unmannerly!

728
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,699
With many holiday and lady terms

729
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,879
he question'd me; amongst
the rest, demanded

730
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,279
my prisoners in your majesty's behalf.

731
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,279
I then, all smarting
with my wounds being cold

732
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,230
out of my grief and my impatience

733
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:42,286
answer'd neglectingly I know not what

734
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:45,519
he should or he should
not; for he made me mad

735
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,319
to see him shine so
brisk and smell so sweet

736
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,839
and talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

737
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,704
of guns and drums and wounds

738
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,153
[Hotspur] God save the mark!

739
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,529
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord

740
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,199
was answer'd indirectly, as I said.

741
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,743
This lord who so
provoked your heated words

742
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,858
what was his name?

743
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:25,663
I cannot recall, my liege.

744
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,651
Um...

745
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:36,485
[electrifying sound]

746
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,401
[voice from map] The circumstance--

747
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:39,899
The circumstance
consider'd, good my lord

748
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,424
whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said

749
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:44,889
may reasonably die and never rise

750
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,559
to do him wrong or any way impeach

751
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,600
what he had said, so he unsay it now.

752
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:51,459
[electrifying sound]

753
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,480
[Prince Hal] Well said, my noble knight.

754
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,859
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners

755
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,575
but with proviso and exception

756
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:02,319
that we at our own
charge shall ransom home

757
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,319
his brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer

758
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,169
who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd

759
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,689
the lives of those that
he did lead to fight

760
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,082
against that great
magician, damn'd Glendower.

761
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:19,083
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears

762
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,698
when they have lost and
forfeited themselves?

763
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,533
No--

764
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,781
on the barren mountains let him starve

765
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,979
for I shall never hold that man my friend

766
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,759
whose tongue shall ask
me for one penny cost

767
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,369
to ransom home revolted Mortimer.

768
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,408
Revolted Mortimer!

769
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,049
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege

770
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,579
but by the chance of war!

771
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Thou dost belie him,
Percy, thou dost belie him.

772
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:50,922
Art thou not ashamed?

773
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,899
But, sirrah, henceforth

774
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,388
let me not hear thee speak of Mortimer.

775
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,789
Bring me your Douglas
with the speediest means

776
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,219
or you shall hear from me in such a kind

777
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,919
as will displease you.

778
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,760
Look to it at once!

I thank thee that thou chose to overlook

my name when thou
recounted Holmedon's fray.

783
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:20,499
I must express my earnest gratitude--

784
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,779
Your gratitude is worth nothing to me

785
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,910
whilst Mortimer my brother lies in chains

786
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,789
and we men of the North who won that crown

787
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,389
that your father so
proudly wears are dogged

788
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,029
at every turn by his misgovernance!

789
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,562
Let not his wrathful
mood affright your heart.

790
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:43,753
I am the cause of his distemperment.

791
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,330
He sees that I am yet to take a wife

792
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,353
and worries I am not...

793
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:55,119
The marriage type.

794
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:59,349
He loves thee well, and heartily desires

795
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,635
that I reform myself to be like thee.

796
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:06,369
Therefore, if it should
please thee, stay at court

797
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,159
and join me in a hunt, or
else at dice, or tennis.

798
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,069
Therein serve a double aim.

799
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,379
Convince my father that I spend my time

800
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,899
in company of which he doth approve

801
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,199
and by that feint we calm his stormy mood

802
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,719
thy suit for Mortimer may yet succeed!

803
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,019
And secondly we serve our private aim.

804
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,231
Which is, if I have
read thy heart correct--

805
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:31,209
Is this the business
that the Prince of Wales

806
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,179
finds suits his majesty, eh?

807
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,613
Tennis? Dice?

808
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,449
Are't so effeminate?

809
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,269
Are't so attuned to that
degenerate company you keep?

810
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,569
Whose prince is this,
who minces and who chats

811
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,879
more like a Princess than a royal heir?

812
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,489
I know you love your brother Mortimer

813
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,159
and for that love, and
that which I bear you

814
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,249
I shall attempt to calm my father's storm.

815
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,569
Meantime, my lords, obedience is due.

816
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,549
Send us your prisoners,
or you will hear of it.

817
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,502
An' if the devil come and roar for them

818
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:08,589
I will not send them: I will
after straight and tell him so

819
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,859
for I will ease my heart, albeit
I make a hazard of my head!

820
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,329

- Stay and pause awhile.

824
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,059

825
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,459
in rage by King Henry.

826
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,472
Go fetch him in.

seen us here before.

In friendship or in enmity, choose one

I care not, simply do as thou art told.

842
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:12,310

his cheek look'd pale

866

Sometimes I feel like

In nine parts loathsome irritation

1203

I promised to love, honour and obey.

1218
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:45,879
I gained so much - this
castle, servants and

1219
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,979
all of the respect and admiration

1220
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,589
that suits a lady of my birth.

1221
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,469
I was the eldest child -
my parents did not know

1222
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:54,789
that they would have my brother after me

1223
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:57,249
being advanced in years when I was born.

1224
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,849
And so I was taught to
think, to shoot, to write

1225
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,819
to manage an estate: my parents planned

1226
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,619
to make me their inheritor!

1227
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,710
[sighs]

1228
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,722
But then my brother Edmund was born.

1229
00:56:08,723 --> 00:56:11,979
And do not think that I do
not love him, or that I am

1230
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,399
ungrateful for these
things that I've gained.

1231
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,349
A husband well respected, gallant, strong

1232
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:24,373
advancing into the world,
as he withdraws from me.

1233
00:56:26,836 --> 00:56:27,669
But I...

1234
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,876
Some days I feel the lack

1235
00:56:32,877 --> 00:56:36,009
of that which I have
lost, most principally

1236
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,383
the future I imagined for myself.

1237
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,959
I am a wife. Now just a wife.

1238
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,932
Nay, no, not 'just, ' I do
not mean to make it small.

1239
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:52,839
It is a joy, it is a duty, I am blessed.

1240
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,729
And yet--

1241
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,554
It's tough when people see
you only in relation to men.

1242
00:56:58,555 --> 00:57:01,704
Yes! That is what I
mean, those are the words!

1243
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:05,079
I read Protagoras - for I can read.

1244
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,729
He wrote, 'Man is the
measure of all things.'

1245
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:14,319
But why 'man, ' why not
'woman?' Why say 'man?'

1246
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,409

1595
01:13:12,985 --> 01:13:15,076
colleaguèd with the dream of his advantage

1596
01:13:15,077 --> 01:13:18,549
he hath not failed to
pester us with message

1597
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,519
importing the surrender of those lands

1598
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,767
lost by his father, with all bonds of law

1599
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:26,802
to our most valiant brother.

1600
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:27,636
So much for him.

1601
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:28,655
[court laughs]

1602
01:13:28,656 --> 01:13:29,997
Oh Christ!

1603
01:13:29,998 --> 01:13:31,113
Now for ourself
[hurried footsteps]

1604
01:13:31,114 --> 01:13:32,438
and for this time of meeting

1605
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:35,251
thus much the business
is: we have here writ

1606
01:13:35,252 --> 01:13:38,649
to Norway, uncle of Fortinbras

1607
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:41,109
who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears

1608
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,469
of this his nephew's purpose - to suppress

1609
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,649
his further gait herein;
in that the levies

1610
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:49,582
lists and full proportions
[hurried footsteps]

1611
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:50,533
are all made

1612
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:51,457
- out of his subject--
- Give me the map.

1613
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,190
- and we here dispatch--
- Give me the map.

1614
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:54,881
- you, good Cornelius--
- Give me the map.

1615
01:13:54,882 --> 01:13:55,919
- our loyal friend--
- Give me the map.

1616
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,629
for bearer of this greeting to old Norway

1617
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,669
giving to you no further personal power

1618
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,979
to business with the
king more than the scope

1619
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,902
of these delated articles allow.

1620
01:14:05,768 --> 01:14:06,601
Farewell--

1621
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:07,434
Give me the map!

1622
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:08,370
and let your haste--

1623
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:09,203
Give me the map, give me the map!

1624
01:14:09,203 --> 01:14:10,036
commend your duty.

1625
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:11,410
[short of breath] Give me
the map! Give me the map!

1626
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:14,139
In that and all things
I will show my duty.

1627
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,419
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell!

1628
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,779
And now, Laertes, what
is the news with you?

1629
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,389
You told us of some
suit; what is't, Laertes?

1630
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:25,089
Your leave and favour
to return to France

1631
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,414
- from whence--
- [wheezing] Give it! Give it!

1632
01:14:26,415 --> 01:14:27,813
though willingly I came to Denmark--

1633
01:14:27,814 --> 01:14:28,895
- [Sam grunting and gasping]
- To show my duty

1634
01:14:28,896 --> 01:14:32,456
in your coronation, yet now,
I must confess, that duty done

1635
01:14:32,457 --> 01:14:35,072
my thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France

1636
01:14:35,073 --> 01:14:35,906
[Sam exhales distressed]

1637
01:14:35,907 --> 01:14:37,849
and bow them to your gracious leave--

1638
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,758
Give me the map!

1639
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,680
Have you your father's leave?

1640
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:43,681
[Sam murmurs indistinctly]

1641
01:14:43,682 --> 01:14:46,071
He hath, my lord: wrung
from me my slow leave.

1642
01:14:46,072 --> 01:14:46,905
[Sam pants heavily]

1643
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:49,333
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

1644
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,394
Take thy fair hour

1645
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:53,485
Laertes; time be thine
[hurried footsteps]

1646
01:14:53,486 --> 01:14:56,076
and thy best graces use it at thy will!

1647
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:05,130
And now, Hamlet, our cousin, and our son

1648
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:10,239
how is it that the
clouds still hang on you?

1649
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,659
Not so, my lord; I
am too much i'the sun.

1650
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,303
Good Hamlet, cast
thy nighted colour off.

1651
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:21,939
Thou know'st 'tis common;
all that lives must die.

1652
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,486
Passing through nature to eternity.

1653
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:25,785
Ay, madam

1654
01:15:25,786 --> 01:15:27,309
it is common.

1655
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:30,609
If it be, why seems it
so particular with thee?

1656
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,969
Seems, madam! nay it
is; I know not 'seems.'

1657
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,759
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother

1658
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,419
together with all forms,
moods, shapes of grief

1659
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:44,889
that can denote me
truly: these indeed seem

1660
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:48,609
for they are actions
that a man might play.

1661
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,729
But I have that within which passeth show.

1662
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:54,549
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

1663
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,577
For your intent in going
back to school in Wittenberg

1664
01:15:58,578 --> 01:16:02,109
it is most retrograde to our desire.

1665
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:05,635
And we beseech you, bend you to remain

1666
01:16:05,636 --> 01:16:08,649
here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye

1667
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:11,946
our chiefest courtier, cousin, and son.

1668
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:16,359
[Lady Kate] Let not thy
mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.

1669
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,769
I pray you, stay with
us; go not to Wittenberg.

1670
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:24,339
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

1671
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,343
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

1672
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,566
Be as ourself in Denmark.

1673
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,493
Madam, come.

1674
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:49,433
O, that this too too
solid flesh would melt

1675
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:53,286
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

1676
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,795
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd

1677
01:16:56,796 --> 01:16:59,769
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter.

1678
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:01,153
O God.

1679
01:17:02,338 --> 01:17:03,171
God!

1680
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:09,189
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable

1681
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:12,969
seem to me all the uses of this world!

1682
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:15,427
[Jen] Whoa. Moood.

1683
01:17:15,428 --> 01:17:17,418
[audience laughs]

1684
01:17:17,419 --> 01:17:20,744
Fie on't! ah fie!

1685
01:17:20,745 --> 01:17:24,347
'tis an unweeded garden,
that grows to seed.

1686
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,753
Things rank and gross in natur--

1687
01:17:26,754 --> 01:17:28,929
Ow! What the fuck!
[bottle hits floor]

1688
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:29,770
Sorry! Hi.

1689
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:31,539
Do you remember me?

1690
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,355
I am glad to see you well!

1691
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:34,680
[Jen laughs excitedly]

1692
01:17:34,681 --> 01:17:38,370
- Horatio!
- [audience laughs]

1693
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:40,158
Or I do forget myself!

1694
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,331
Oh bloody hell.

1695
01:17:41,332 --> 01:17:44,259
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

1696
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,299
I didn't come from chuffing Wittenberg.

1697
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,351
I'm from Framlingham!

1698
01:17:48,352 --> 01:17:51,219
Look, my name is Jen, okay?
We spoke about 20 minutes ago.

1699
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,011
And I've come here. I've come here to

1700
01:17:53,012 --> 01:17:54,439
tell you something really important--

1701
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,699
I pray thee, do not
mock me, fellow-student.

1702
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,277
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

1703
01:18:00,278 --> 01:18:01,352
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1704
01:18:01,353 --> 01:18:03,849
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!

1705
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:05,829
The funeral baked meats

1706
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:09,283
did coldly furnish forth
the marriage tables!

1707
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:12,193
My father!

1708
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:15,504
Methinks I see my father.

1709
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:16,338
Where?

1710
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,869
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

1711
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:25,939
Okay, right, let me save
you about five hours here.

1712
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,322

[Sam] Hail to your Lordship!

01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:00,879
Marcellus, hello!

1729
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,039
What make you from
Wittenberg, my worthy friend?

1730
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,052
A truant disposition, good my lord!

1731
01:19:05,053 --> 01:19:07,209
Oh, I would not hear your enemy say so

1732
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,279
nor shall you do mine ear that violence

1733
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,619
to truster your own
report against yourself.

1734
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,879
I know you are no truant.

1735
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,713
What are you doing?

1736
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:15,699
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

1737
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,089
I saw him once; he was a goodly King.

1738
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:23,552
He was a man, take him for all in all

1739
01:19:23,553 --> 01:19:25,509
I shall not look upon his like again.

1740
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,429
Sorry, excuse me, Prince Hamlet

1741
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,856
could I please borrow, um...

1742
01:19:29,857 --> 01:19:31,299
What's your name supposed to be?

1743
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,133
Marcellus.

1744
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:34,711
Can I borrow her? I'll
bring her right back!

1745
01:19:38,849 --> 01:19:40,259
[shrieks] No!

1746
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,831
What are you doing?

1747
01:19:41,832 --> 01:19:43,476
I'm trying to fix your bloody mess!

1748
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:46,232
No, Sam, you said these
characters are just antibodies.

1749
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:48,649
They're not, she's
trapped here just like us!

1750
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,289
Don't pretend you
have the slightest idea

1751
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,265
what's going on down here

1752
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:52,599
when 90 minutes ago you still believed

1753
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,489
you were married to an Ancient Roman!

1754
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,323
You need to sit down

1755
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:56,838
and think about your behaviour, duck egg.

1756
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:58,861
Everything was going fine
up there until you broke it.

1757
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:00,845
Now we've been kicked all
the way down to the bottom!

1758
01:20:00,846 --> 01:20:02,197
So what?

1759
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:04,064
Look, let's just tell her and we can all

1760
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,279
find a way out together.

1761
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,575
The only way out is back up there

1762
01:20:07,576 --> 01:20:09,824
at the end of "Henry IV" Part One

1763
01:20:09,825 --> 01:20:11,271
which we now can't get to

1764
01:20:11,272 --> 01:20:12,789
because one of the major characters

1765
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:15,219
is having an identity crisis!

1766
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,869
You're lucky we ended up in "Hamlet."

1767
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:18,819
If we'd fallen into "Titus Andronicus"

1768
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,710
we could have been baked into pies!

1769
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:21,544
[audience laughs]

1770
01:20:21,545 --> 01:20:24,879
I checked the map. I know
what happens to her at the end.

1771
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,959
Well nothing happens now

1772
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,477
because you've derailed the whole thing!

1773
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,009
What's meant to happen is Prince Hal

1774
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:35,079
proves himself worthy of the crown

1775
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,073
by saving his father's life
and defeating Harry Hotspur.

1776
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:41,774
She dies!

1777
01:20:41,775 --> 01:20:43,839
Hotspur ends up as the tragic foil

1778
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,519
for Prince Hal's transformation--

1779
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,659
But she dies!

1780
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:48,279
Dies nobly.

1781
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,749
Dies giving a beautiful speech

1782
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,275
about time and life and honour.

1783
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:56,619
Would you take that away?

1784
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,809
Would you say, 'Hey,
actually, all those things

1785
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,489
you think you did, all
those accomplishments

1786
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:02,011
that was all a lie.

1787
01:21:02,012 --> 01:21:05,169
Those people that love you,
they don't really love you

1788
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,467
they just love this
character you're performing.'

1789
01:21:08,318 --> 01:21:09,367
Do you think it's right

1790
01:21:09,368 --> 01:21:11,220
to inflict that kind of
knowledge on someone?

1791
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:12,348
To rip them out of their life?

1792
01:21:12,349 --> 01:21:13,632
Cheat them out of their death?

1793
01:21:13,633 --> 01:21:16,345
They are here because they want to be.

1794
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:18,189
Do you? Do you want to be stuck down here

1795
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,710
like one of these dead-eyed zombie cunts?

1796
01:21:25,694 --> 01:21:28,186
I've been down here a long time.

1797
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:33,023
A really, really fucking long time.

1798
01:21:33,024 --> 01:21:34,807
And I need to get out.

1799
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,663
I wasn't Cleopatra.

1800
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:45,340
When I woke up in "Antony and
Cleopatra" I wasn't Cleopatra.

1801
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:48,131
I was Messenger Number 7.

1802
01:21:49,265 --> 01:21:50,690
I had one line in Act III.

1803
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:54,963
'The emperor calls Canidius.'

1804
01:21:57,130 --> 01:22:01,306
That was my whole character.
My whole world, one line.

1805
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:02,840
It's not even ten syllables.

1806
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:07,231
Even if you really milk
'emperor' it's still only nine.

1807
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,166
[audience laughs]

1808
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:13,982
I said that line until I
was sick to death of it.

1809
01:22:13,983 --> 01:22:16,329
I wanted to bash my brains
out or jump off a building.

1810
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:19,719
I was so, so, tired of
being a minor character.

1811
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,889
You at least got to be Portia.

1812
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,829
You got to stand up there being beautiful

1813
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:27,480
and clever and have loads of lines, it...

1814
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:29,123
It broke my heart.

1815
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,626
One line was all of everything I ever got.

1816
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,715
Until one night I realised

1817
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,973
I'm bigger than this!

1818
01:22:42,107 --> 01:22:45,459
And I deserve to have a bit of recognition

1819
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,270
and self determination in life, don't I?

1820
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,140
I worked hard to get that map

1821
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:58,970
and to get you out, and now...

1822
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,910
I don't have anything
left to give anymore.

1823
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,373
I'm sorry.

1824
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:11,353
Sam, I-I'm sorry, I got caught up in it.

1825
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,143
Okay, let's go.

1826
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:22,329
It might not be too late.

1827
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,174
Maybe you can still get up
there and get to that door.

1828
01:23:25,175 --> 01:23:26,008
Okay?

1829
01:23:28,534 --> 01:23:30,025

Ay, there's the rub.

1861
01:25:34,767 --> 01:25:38,499
For in that sleep of
death what dreams may come

1862
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,829
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil

1863
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:45,369

1864
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:49,059
that makes calamity of so long life.

1865
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:53,049

but that the dread of
something after death

1869
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:09,069
which makes us rather
bear those ills we have

1870

than fly to others that we know not of?

1871

make cowards of us all

else did you get here?

just to facilitate you!

remember that conversation

1906
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,876
we had at Alnwick and that noise?

1907
01:28:05,877 --> 01:28:07,479
It was just a dream.

1908
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,911
Give me that and ride home, Kate.

1909
01:28:09,912 --> 01:28:12,159
Are you even listening to
me? Stop ordering me around!

1910
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:15,999
That is thy role! That
is thy calling, Kate!

1911
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,689
It is what God and Nature hath assigned.

1912
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:22,419
It is not Woman's place to give commands.

1913
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:26,169
It is not Woman's place to rule thyself.

1914

I would be softer with thee if I could

1915
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:33,810
but this our war is
forged of swords and mail.

1916

No weakness nor no womanly gentleness

1917
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,819
can we allow to creep into our hearts

1918
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,769

managed to tolerate it.

actually communicates.

1929

1930
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,685

than stay here with you.

been acting as your spinoff.

1935
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:48,729
and I say good luck

1936
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:51,082

1937
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:54,973

I'm looking at right now

1938

loved you, but I don't.

01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,489
I sent her home.

1944
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:19,000
Her woman's heart did break
in being parted from me

1945
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:20,739
but t'was right.

1946
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:23,679
My heart doth burn to
charge into the field!

1947
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,709
The red hot breath of action roars in me!

1948
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:29,379
Five hundred Cheshire yeoman have we, yes?

1949
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,659
We shall arrange them up by Harlescott

1950
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,789
Better to look down upon the field

1951
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:37,149
and rain their missiles
on King Henry's power!

1952
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:38,514
The cavalry from Wales--

1953
01:30:38,515 --> 01:30:40,227
Yea, yea, but first--

1954
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:43,689
This letter comes
from old Northumberland.

1955
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:46,138
A letter from him. Why
comes he not himself?

1956
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:48,819
He cannot come: he
says he is grievous sick.

1957
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,739
I prithee, tell me,
doth he keep his bed?

1958
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,259
He did, his rider said, four days ago

1959
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:54,969
and at the time of his departure thence

1960
01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:57,759
he was much feared by his physicians.

1961
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,779
We must amend our plans: I say withdraw.

1962
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:06,009
Yet all goes well, yet
all our joints are whole!

1963
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:08,379
I loath to crush that
Spring in you, my lord

1964
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,619
with further winter words
but here's further news.

1965
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:14,919
The Earl of Westmoreland,
seven thousand strong

1966
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,949
is marching hitherwards;
with him Prince John.

1967
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:20,229
No harm: what more?

1968
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:22,149
And further, I have learn'd

1969
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:25,449
the king himself in person is set forth

1970
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:28,719
with strong and mighty preparation!

1971
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,943
He shall be welcome too.

1972
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:36,304
Where is his son, that
nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales

1973
01:31:36,305 --> 01:31:37,986
and his comrades?

1974
01:31:37,987 --> 01:31:40,869
All furnish'd, all in arms.

1975
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:44,049
All plumed like estridges
that with the wind

1976
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:46,509
baited like eagles having lately bathed.

1977
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:49,239
Glittering in golden coats, like images

1978
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,309
as full of spirit as the month of May

1979
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,749
and gorgeous as the sun--

1980
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:57,716
Let them come on: they come
like sacrifices in their trim

1981
01:31:57,717 --> 01:32:00,541
and to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war

1982
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:03,669
all hot and bleeding will we offer them!

1983
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:05,169
We'll fight with him tonight.

1984
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:07,736
Good nephew, be
advised; we must withdraw!

1985
01:32:07,737 --> 01:32:11,739
You speak but out of
fear and a cold heart.

1986
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:15,219
Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life

1987
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,439
I hold as little counsel with weak fear

1988
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,409
as you my lord, or any man that lives!

1989
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:22,959
The number of the king exceedeth ours.

1990
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,989
For God's sake nephew, we must withdraw!

1991
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,629
Thy father's sickness is a maim to us

1992
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:31,269
a perilous gash, a very limb lopped off.

1993
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:33,849
Before we rode from Bangor father gave

1994
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:37,449
all deeds and rights of
my inheritance to me.

1995
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:40,059
All powers and authority.

1996
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:43,299
He trusted me to be our family.

1997
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,494
I am the latest in that line of sons

1998
01:32:46,495 --> 01:32:49,839
that stretcheth back
through centuries long gone.

1999
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,533
Each drop of blood in
me doth bear that debt.

2000
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,849
[Hotspur] I'll play the
part of old Northumberland

2001
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,699
and you shall see his manly strength in me

2002
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:04,929
reflected as a blade reflects the sun.

2003
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:09,189
My Lord of Worcester,
is this not Hotspur?

2004
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:11,859
Why doubt you his prowess in leading us?

2005
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,713
Have you no pride in
him? Have you no faith?

2006
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:18,529
If Hotspur says that we can win this fight

2007
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:21,703
then I shall stand
beside him and not quail.

2008
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,799
Pray, do not take my caution as a sign

2009
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,079
that I am not proud of thee.

2010
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:34,080
I am. Thy life has run
by in so small a span.

2011
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:38,619
Why I recall, but yesterday it seems

2012
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:41,979
a little boy who stood not three feet high

2013
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,169
and could not mount his horse.

2014
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:48,009
I picked him up, I sat him in
the saddle, gave him reigns.

2015
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:49,569
He galloped off.

2016
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:52,377
And now he has returned

2017
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:55,630
though I and that boy
both have been transformed

2018
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:59,780
by time, and I see now

2019
01:33:59,781 --> 01:34:02,731
thou art a man.

2020
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:10,209
Your love doth make
me twice the man I am.

2021
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:13,989
And if I fall, so falls the man you know

2022
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:17,561
with all these honours you bestow intact.

2023
01:34:17,562 --> 01:34:19,528
[percussion]

2024
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:29,729
[percussion stops]

2025
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,629
How now, my rebel lords!

2026
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:34,689
It is not well that you and
I should meet upon such terms

2027
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:36,249
as now we meet.

2028
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,082
You have deceived our trust

2029
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:41,139
making us doff the easy robes of peace

2030
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:45,183
to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.

2031
01:34:45,184 --> 01:34:48,189
It is not well, my lords, it is not well.

2032
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:51,069
For mine own part, I
could be well content

2033
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:52,989
to entertain the lag-end of my life

2034
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:55,689
with quiet hours; for I do protest

2035
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,779
I have not sought the day of this dislike.

2036
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,539
You have not sought it? Hah!

2037
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:02,872
How comes it then?

2038
01:35:02,873 --> 01:35:05,319
It pleased your majesty
to turn your looks

2039
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:09,099
of favour from myself and all our house!

2040
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:12,189
If Hotspur's good
deserts have been forgot

2041
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:15,459
we bid you name your
griefs and with all speed

2042
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,099
you shall have your desires with interest

2043
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,459

snake, this King of smiles

2047
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,229
This must be Douglas,
Scotland's hairy thane

2048
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:38,031
though out of orbit, Heaven
knows you're further south

2049
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,249
than he has a right to be!

2050
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:42,129
Your majesty should check the map again.

2051
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:44,853
Put muzzles on your dog before he bites

2052
01:35:44,854 --> 01:35:46,519
[Douglas growls] - or
you shall answer to the

2053
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,353
crown for him.

2054
01:35:47,354 --> 01:35:50,709
We gave you that same royalty you wear.

2055
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:53,229
And when you were not
six and twenty strong

2056
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:57,489
sick in the world's
regard, wretched and low

2057
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:01,029
my father gave you welcome to the shore.

2058
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,309
And when the lords and barons of the realm

2059
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:06,819
perceived Northumberland did lean to you

2060
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:11,169
the more and less came
in with cap and knee!

2061
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:15,459
In short time after, you deposed the king.

2062
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:18,579
Soon after that, deprived him of his life.

2063
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,979
Disgraced me in my happy victories

2064
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:23,469
rated mine uncle from the council-board.

2065
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:26,469
In rage dismissed my
father from the court.

2066
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:30,429
Broke oath on oath,
committed wrong on wrong

2067
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:32,619
and in conclusion drove us to seek out

2068
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:35,469
this head of safety; and withal to pry

2069
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:38,619
into your title, the which we find

2070
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:41,499
too indirect for long continuance!

2071
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,359
These things indeed you have articulate

2072
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,149
with some fine colour
that may please the eye

2073
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:48,459
to face the garment of rebellion.

2074
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:50,679
In both our armies there is many a soul

2075
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,099
shall pay full dearly for this encounter

2076
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,869
if once they join in trial.

2077
01:36:55,870 --> 01:37:00,870
Therefore Hotspur: I do not
think a braver gentleman

2079

more daring or more bold, is now alive.

2080
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:14,623
For my part, I may speak it to my shame

2081
01:37:14,624 --> 01:37:18,398
I have a truant been to chivalry

2082
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:21,489
