00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,088
- [Pebbles] Hi, I'm Pebbles.

2
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,217
What are you doing right now?

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,479
Something naughty? (giggling)

4
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:26,008
Something fun?

5
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:28,836
Share with us.

6
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:29,966
1-900-10MIAMI.

7
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:35,554
- Hello, my name's Grace.

8
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:37,084
Are you lonely?

9
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:38,947
Would you like to talk to me?

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,810
Share your secret desires with me?

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,734
Just call me, I'm waiting to talk to you.

12
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,661
Call 1-900-10MIAMI.

13
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:49,457
- [Pixie] Hi, I'm Pixie.

14
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,087
- [Man] I wanna talk to Grace.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,317
Grace?

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,080
It's me again.

17
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:57,872
I can't allow you to go on like this, teasing me.

18
00:00:57,905 --> 00:00:59,933
You've been a naughty girl, Grace.

19
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,863
And you know what happens to naughty girls?

20
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,757
They burn in Hell for eternity.

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,752
I'm putting an end to this flirting.

22
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,712
I'm coming for you, Grace, and I will find you.

23
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:12,406
No man will ever touch you.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,768
I am your destiny.

25
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,397
Grace, don't hang up!

26
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,757
Bitch!

27
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:33,194
(suspenseful music)

28
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:55,545
(upbeat island music)

29
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,999
- You yell four.

30
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,729
- Number four? - Four.

31
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,825
- I know that, what if I hit him?

32
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:06,221
- You yell four, you won't hit him.

33
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:07,918
- It's time for a lawsuit.

34
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,414
- (chuckles) What do you care?

35
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:11,077
You've got nothing to give him.

36
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,239
(muffled)

37
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,104
Big deal.

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,076
I'm gonna show you a pull.

39
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,672
(muffled) As much as you have.

40
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:29,770
How much you hauling?

41
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:31,232
- A nickel. - What?

42
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,060
- A nickel a hole, you got it.

43
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,043
Warm up.

44
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:44,338
- That's good, that's good.

45
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,299
- A nickel a hole?

46
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,262
- [Mack] Nickel a hole.

47
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:54,980
- Hike!

48
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:57,275
(laughing)

49
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,001
- Get out of here.

50
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,218
- A nickel a hole? - Nickel a hole.

51
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:09,781
- I dub thee, Sir Ball.

52
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,473
Oh!

53
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,098
(laughing)

54
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,684
Where'd you like me to stand?

55
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:24,814
- Any place you like.

56
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:25,846
- I'd like to stand close to you.

57
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,010
- Well get up there.

58
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:28,274
Come closer.

59
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:29,504
Now move the foot.

60
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:30,768
- There you go.

61
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,423
Proud of you.

62
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:38,850
Oh, sorry.

63
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,598
- Right here.

64
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:26,945
- Oh. (laughing)

65
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,064
(yelling)

66
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,521
- Picked a hell of a time to go on a vacation.

67
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,250
- Well that's just my point.

68
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:41,413
It is a hell of a time to go on a vacation.

69
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,339
We haven't had a case in five weeks.

70
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,832
The rent on your dumb boat is due.

71
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,260
The Tabbot Sports page is as long as a tapeworm.

72
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,419
- All right, all right, so the private detective

73
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:55,115
business is a little slow.

74
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,143
Hey man, you know, big things can happen any time.

75
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:00,770
- Yes, I know, but I have a big thing

76
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:03,730
that I'm going to give to a feminine mystery in Jamaica.

77
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:06,125
She is waiting on me at this moment.

78
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:06,989
You got it?

79
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:07,821
- I can understand that.

80
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:08,653
- Good, I'm glad you can.

81
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:09,484
- My man.

82
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,781
- I rest my case.

83
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:13,076
(laughing)

84
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,487
- So, tell me, how long you gonna be gone, man?

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,116
- Depends.

86
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,047
- Depends on what?

87
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:28,975
- How long my cash holds out.

88
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,039
(laughing)

89
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:32,201
- Two days, I expect to see you back in two days.

90
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:33,797
- You're probably right.

91
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,059
You know, I've been thinking.

92
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,489
I know I could have been a good cop.

93
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:39,884
- Oh, come on now, don't give me that crap.

94
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:43,110
You're just like me, man, unemployable.

95
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,806
You stay in the game too goddamn long.

96
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,500
You don't like taking orders, you like to give 'em.

97
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:48,498
And the hours you keep?

98
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:49,463
Forget about it.

99
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,558
- I know, I know, I know!

100
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,554
Making tackles is a lot easier

101
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,913
than this unpredictable stupid spy stuff we do.

102
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,875
Besides, we take four hours for lunch.

103
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,206
- Lunch?

104
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,803
- Yeah, lunch, four hours.

105
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,632
- Mama, I gotta get ready for my mama.

106
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,929
Big shopping day.

107
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:06,226
See you, partner.

108
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,423
- Is it her money?

109
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:08,288
- Mine.

110
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,838
(slow music)

111
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:24,054
Look, I'm gonna stop here for a couple minutes,

112
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:24,885
and get a few things.

113
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:25,750
Now, you wait for me, okay?

114
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:27,546
- Okay. - all right.

115
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,311
- Just take what you want, and please, don't hurt us.

116
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:47,535
(alarm ringing)

117
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:48,400
- Damn.

118
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,264
Mama.

119
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,255
You all right, mama?

120
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,253
Hey, hey!

121
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,515
Hey, hey, hold it, hold it!

122
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,637
(gunshots)

123
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:45,774
(gunshot)

124
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:47,236
- Hey pal, throw down the gun!

125
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,299
Throw down the gun or I'll blow this one away!

126
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:50,496
Throw it down!

127
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,004
Your move, pal!

128
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:03,268
(gunshots)

129
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:05,630
(screaming)

130
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,055
- You okay?

131
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,419
- Yeah, I think so.

132
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:16,406
- Oh, mama.

133
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:18,368
Mama.

134
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:35,763
- Get back!

135
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:36,961
Get back or I'll kill her!

136
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:41,185
- Shoot, Mack, shoot him between the eyes!

137
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:43,546
(screaming)

138
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,803
(gunshots)

139
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,644
- Hello, this is Roland Friedricks, WXTV Miami.

140
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,972
With me now, is Mrs. Mabel Derringer,

141
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,967
who was involved in averting a daring

142
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,460
daytime robbery attempt here at the Seaside Mall.

143
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:08,956
- [Officer On Radio] 31546.

144
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,409
- Every license you're supposed to have is expired.

145
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:17,571
You're walking around with an unlicensed piece,

146
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:20,531
bodies all over the goddamn place.

147
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:23,923
- Come on, Ted, I was just doing my public duty, okay?

148
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,454
You can fix it, right?

149
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,350
- I can't fix this kind of shit,

150
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,611
and I'm tired of covering for you, man.

151
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,534
Forget it, I'll fix it.

152
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:37,394
Walk away.

153
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:41,053
Paledo, don't leave.

154
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:46,673
I need two guys back. (muffled)

155
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,195
The bitch.

156
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,341
- [Officer On Radio] 335 new badge MB information.

157
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,772
- You okay?

158
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,399
- Yeah, I'm okay.

159
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:06,696
I still gotta go to the hospital, though,

160
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,126
my dad was hurt really bad.

161
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,384
- I'm sorry to hear that.

162
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,481
- Thank you.

163
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,809
Thank you, thank you for everything.

164
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:16,907
- Bye bye now.

165
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:18,470
You all come and see me, okay?

166
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:19,335
Bye.

167
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,199
Mack?

168
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,329
Mack?

169
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,654
- Maybe we can talk again sometime, okay?

170
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,783
That's my mama callin', I gotta go.

171
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,264
- Nice talking to you, too.

172
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,589
Good morning, Jennifer.

173
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,852
- Hi, Patty, how's it going?

174
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:43,881
- Hey, I've had three proposals already.

175
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:44,712
- Already?

176
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:45,578
So soon?

177
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,608
- Some of these guys wake up

178
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,238
in the morning at full attention.

179
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,269
- That's just because they don't know

180
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:51,065
which head to think with.

181
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:53,360
(giggling)

182
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:58,449
- See ya later, I'm out of here.

183
00:10:58,482 --> 00:10:59,613
- See you later, Patty.

184
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,389
(beeping) Suzi, any calls for me?

185
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,784
- A couple, but they said they would call back.

186
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,846
I think one of them was that same weird guy

187
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,208
that's been calling for a week or so.

188
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,469
- God, I was hoping that when I hung up on him last night

189
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,232
he would never call here again.

190
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,662
- [Suzi] How wrong you were.

191
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,680
(suspenseful music)

192
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,691
(phone ringing)

193
00:11:39,724 --> 00:11:41,754
- This is Pebbles at your service.

194
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:44,548
Certainly, just a moment.

195
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:48,173
- Hey, Jennifer, that weird guy's on the phone for you.

196
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,567
- God, why would she need my name like that?

197
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,545
Hello, this is Grace.

198
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:02,508
- [Man] You're still teasing my Grace.

199
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,603
You say things, but you don't mean 'em.

200
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,430
I tried to warn you, but you didn't listen.

201
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:10,091
You're forcing me to punish you, Grace.

202
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,887
I'm gonna make you mine.

203
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,749
- Please.

204
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,280
- [Man] You can't run from a shadow

205
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:17,708
in the moonlight, Jennifer.

206
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,630
- Damn.

207
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,193
Suzi!

208
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:25,490
Suzi.

209
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,020
That was dumb, that was really dumb.

210
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:27,852
- What?

211
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,115
What did I do?

212
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,211
- You used my real name, he heard you.

213
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,074
- So what?

214
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:35,402
That freak sounds like he's a million miles away.

215
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:37,464
- Suzi, don't you ever do that to me again.

216
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:40,225
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

217
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:52,099
(phone ringing)

218
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:57,088
Hello?

219
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:00,047
- I saw you on T.V., you sure are pretty.

220
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:01,212
- Thanks.

221
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,808
What's your name?

222
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,773
- [Billy] Billy.

223
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,735
How many girls work there with you?

224
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:09,626
- Well, usually four, but...

225
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,019
I'm alone right now, it's so late.

226
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,148
Did you get a busy signal?

227
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,312
- Yeah.

228
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,775
- I thought so.

229
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:20,203
We had a lot of calls lately.

230
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,760
- [Billy] I want you to tell me how you'd like to do it.

231
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:25,924
- Do what?

232
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:28,485
- [Billy] You know, it.

233
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,547
- Maybe you're a cop.

234
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,742
- (laughing) Do I sound like a cop?

235
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,738
- I guess not.

236
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,565
- [Billy] So tell me how you want me to do it to you.

237
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:41,257
- Well, you know, like...

238
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,286
Like, well, like an--

239
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,649
- [Billy] Animal.

240
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,878
- (giggles) Yeah.

241
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,073
- [Billy] Doggy style.

242
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:54,095
- Woof, woof, woof. (laughing)

243
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,213
Hello?

244
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,841
- [Billy] You're going to get your chance.

245
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,435
No more teasin', Pebbles.

246
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:27,954
(glass breaking)

247
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:30,316
(screaming)

248
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:36,070
- No, no!

249
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,595
(screaming)

250
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,704
No, please, no!

251
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,597
No!

252
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:55,959
(screaming)

253
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,164
- [Woman] Escort service.

254
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:57,124
- Listen, I'm new in town, and I want a girl

255
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,217
who'd do anything I want.

256
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,378
I understand you've got a Francesca there.

257
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,132
(gasping)

258
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,494
(screaming)

259
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,307
- [Woman On Radio] I have a complaint about vehicles.

260
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,168
325 Northeast fifth at Willow Wood Apartments.

261
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:55,463
325 Northeast fifth.

262
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,190
With silver Cadillac and a green Cadillac parked

263
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,717
so that we cannot see the oncoming traffic.

264
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:01,549
- Jennifer.

265
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:02,381
I gotta ask you something.

266
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,511
You see this note?

267
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,042
Who is this Billy?

268
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:06,871
- I don't know, it's just a voice over

269
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:09,099
the phone that keeps calling me.

270
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,729
He keeps telling me these things

271
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,458
that we wants to do to me.

272
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:15,751
- You think this guy was local?

273
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,913
- No, he sounded far away.

274
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,740
The strange thing about it, is there's this picture

275
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,035
missing off my desk.

276
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:24,831
- [Officer] Picture?

277
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:28,523
- Yeah, one of Mack and I during our better times.

278
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:33,545
- Why the hell would you want a picture of the two of you?

279
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:39,432
Jennifer look, this may not be my place to say, but...

280
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,492
You're a friend, and...

281
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:47,282
I don't want you working here, it worries me.

282
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,643
- Well, I've asked for a security guard

283
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,974
many times before, Ted.

284
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:53,002
- Security guard won't make a difference,

285
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,131
crazies wanna get ya, they'll get ya.

286
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:58,290
It's just that, this is not the kind of a job

287
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,420
for a person like you.

288
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:03,646
- Well, what do you suggest I be, a secretary?

289
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,209
Is that for me?

290
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:06,672
I mean, come on.

291
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,867
- Look, let me finish up things,

292
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,498
why don't I take you home?

293
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,626
- That's okay, I got a car.

294
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,557
I can drive, Ted.

295
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:17,648
But thanks, I mean, I appreciate your concern.

296
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:24,433
(car starting)

297
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:40,432
(slow reggae music)

298
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,970
(women chattering)

299
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:54,367
- [Billy] Francesca?

300
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,163
- [Francesca] You must be Billy.

301
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:57,327
- Something for you?

302
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,483
- [Francesca] What's with you?

303
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,112
- I'm not here to make friends,

304
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,542
I need your services.

305
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,338
There's a private detective named Derringer,

306
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,301
he's got something that belongs to me.

307
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,064
I need you to bring it to me,

308
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,093
so I can take what's mine.

309
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,922
- [Francesca] And, why should I do that?

310
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,984
- [Billy] 10 grand.

311
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:30,654
- Hello, Mack.

312
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:33,448
- Jennifer, what brings you here?

313
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,144
My support check bounce?

314
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,869
- Mack, do we gotta fight every time I see you?

315
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,029
- All right, I'm sorry.

316
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,708
What brings you here?

317
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:54,868
- One of the girls got killed where I work last night,

318
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,224
and I don't, god, I don't know how to feel,

319
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,755
I don't know what to do.

320
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:01,918
It's driving me crazy.

321
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,779
I keep getting these strange calls.

322
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:08,404
I got a call from one guy who recites poetry to me,

323
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,799
and tells me how much he loves me,

324
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,928
and then I get this other guy.

325
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,425
God.

326
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,788
He's just crazy.

327
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,950
He just scares me, you know?

328
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,446
- Meaning?

329
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,309
- Meaning he tells me all these things

330
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:22,806
that he's gonna do to me.

331
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:28,693
He tells me he wants to make me his.

332
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,453
- All right, how can I help?

333
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,806
- Well, I know that you've got ways

334
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,168
of finding things out about people.

335
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,325
Ways that are a lot different than the police.

336
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,088
- For old time's sake, right?

337
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:48,682
- Please.

338
00:20:50,844 --> 00:20:52,075
- All right.

339
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:54,402
I'll walk you to your car.

340
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,675
(ominous music)

341
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:26,731
- You should call me sometime.

342
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:33,084
(upbeat jazzy music)

343
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,832
- Okay.

344
00:21:42,963 --> 00:21:43,761
Fine.

345
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:44,626
Do it tonight?

346
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:46,355
Thanks, guys.

347
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:57,198
Heartache?

348
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:58,196
- Nice tune, Renee.

349
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,426
- Thanks. - Yeah.

350
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:00,856
- Gar, can I have a glass of water, please?

351
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,752
Thanks.

352
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:14,294
So, who's winning what, and by how many points?

353
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:17,653
- Well, it depends on what kinda sport you like.

354
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,482
Round ball, or oblong ball?

355
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:22,076
- I love when you talk dirty.

356
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,406
(laughing)

357
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,471
- That new tune you were doing,

358
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:25,768
that's for your friends tonight?

359
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:26,899
- Well, it's a secret of life,

360
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,161
we keep it new and fresh, and they keep wanting it.

361
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:31,423
- That kinda works for everything, doesn't it?

362
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,950
- Man, this is a heavy conversation.

363
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:35,015
(laughing)

364
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,575
- Speaking of heavy, man, I saw some dude today

365
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:40,536
who had bad intentions.

366
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,566
- Bad intentions?

367
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,097
That's your problem.

368
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,492
My problem is, if business doesn't get any better,

369
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:46,989
I'm gonna have to come out of retirement. (laughing)

370
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:49,948
Can you imagine me coming out of retirement?

371
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:53,607
I mean, they're small, but they were sticky.

372
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,702
They called me Glue Fingers.

373
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,197
You remember Chicago?

374
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,192
Super Bowl.

375
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,822
Two minute warning.

376
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:07,609
- 60,000 people, Soldier's Field,

377
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:09,639
20 below zero.

378
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:11,934
- Oh no, not again.

379
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:15,259
- Balls on the 30, third down.

380
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,823
- So what am I this time?

381
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,220
A pitcher or a quarterback?

382
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:24,306
- [Mack] Pretend you're Bart Star.

383
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:27,000
- Who the hell is Bart Star?

384
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,495
- Will history repeat itself?

385
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:34,484
Will the Hail Mary prevail to our victory once again?

386
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:35,981
(crowd cheering)

387
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,840
(whistle blowing)

388
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:58,032
(slow jazzy music)

389
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:11,303
- Oh my god, what is that?

390
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:14,628
- Trouble with a capital T.

391
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,691
- I was thinking more like the F word.

392
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:21,713
- Yeah.

393
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,028
- Mack Derringer?

394
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:36,480
- [Mack] You got it, have a seat.

395
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,673
- My name is Francesca.

396
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,168
- The F word.

397
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,895
- I beg your pardon?

398
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:46,159
- Private joke.

399
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:52,412
- I need a bodyguard, Mr. Derringer.

400
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:55,571
- I don't do bodyguard, I'm a private detective.

401
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,740
Describe your problem.

402
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:12,501
- A jealous boyfriend who likes

403
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:14,563
to use me for a punching bag.

404
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:17,258
- Well, that could be a problem.

405
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,718
- I'm going to a party tomorrow afternoon,

406
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,282
and I want protection.

407
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:23,510
I don't like scenes.

408
00:25:23,544 --> 00:25:25,938
- Can understand that.

409
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:27,900
- What makes you think your boyfriend

410
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:30,429
is gonna bother you at this party?

411
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:32,390
- He says he wants me to bleed to death

412
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,685
in front of all my friends.

413
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,282
- Do you have a lot of friends?

414
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:37,214
- Never enough.

415
00:25:38,676 --> 00:25:39,509
He's dangerous.

416
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:43,101
I'll pick you up tomorrow at four o'clock.

417
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:55,773
And Mr. Derringer, bring your gun.

418
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,721
- Man, now that was all female.

419
00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:05,850
- No question about it.

420
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:09,974
Hey, Ted.

421
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:12,202
Hey look, I wanna thank you for

422
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,633
taking care of that little matter for me.

423
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,562
- One of these days, I might not be able

424
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,591
to take care of one of these little matters for you,

425
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,187
if you don't get your act together.

426
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,950
- Hey, Ted, how's the crime business?

427
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:22,979
- Always a wiseguy, huh, Jake?

428
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:25,308
- Kinda thought you'd be dropping by today.

429
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,369
- And I did.

430
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:28,201
I need to talk to ya.

431
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:30,130
In private.

432
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:36,748
- Follow me.

433
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:44,831
Okay, shoot.

434
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:47,093
- It's about Jennifer.

435
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:49,055
- Who else?

436
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:50,785
- This new job she's got.

437
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,279
It's phone sex, this is bullshit.

438
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,908
- Come on, Ted, it's not phone sex,

439
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:56,006
and what are you telling me for?

440
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,602
She's my ex-wife, remember?

441
00:26:57,636 --> 00:26:59,199
- It's phone sex to me.

442
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,793
Miami's not the right place to play this kinda game.

443
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:03,988
We've had more sex crimes in the last six months

444
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,719
than any other city in the country.

445
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:06,882
- If you're so worried about it,

446
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,177
why don't you tell her yourself, huh?

447
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,408
- Don't shit me, Mack.

448
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:12,304
I know you're still in love with her.

449
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,096
- Ted, I know you've had a thing

450
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,025
for Jennifer ever since you met her.

451
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:20,287
It's okay, man, it's cool.

452
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,783
She's no longer my thing.

453
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:23,014
You want it, go for it.

454
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:25,807
- God damn you, Mack, you're such an asshole,

455
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,805
I thought you'd care.

456
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:28,235
Say something to her, do something about it.

457
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:30,297
You don't really give a shit though, do you?

458
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,326
- I do give a shit, Ted.

459
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,619
I just don't give a shit that you give a shit.

460
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:48,890
- What's happening?

461
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:51,950
- Well, Jennifer's got some weirdo calling her at work.

462
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:55,010
Ted's trying to make it his personal problem.

463
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:55,941
- Personal?

464
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,238
- Yeah, he's got a thing for Jennifer,

465
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:58,635
but he's afraid to tell her.

466
00:27:58,668 --> 00:27:59,733
- What's the big deal?

467
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,296
You like someone, you tell 'em.

468
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:04,190
- Look who's talking, loverboy himself.

469
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:05,986
Why aren't you married?

470
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,915
- Never found somebody to tell it to.

471
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:10,409
- Yeah, well I think my man's problem

472
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:11,973
goes a little deeper than that.

473
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:13,934
It has something to do with the fact

474
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,265
that I knew Jennifer first.

475
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:17,394
I don't think he can ever get over that.

476
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:20,487
We went to college together, we had classes together,

477
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,316
he fixed it that way.

478
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,343
My homework was his homework.

479
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,638
- Sounds like you had a gorilla on your back.

480
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:32,194
- We graduated together, we tried out for the pros together.

481
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,356
I made it, he didn't.

482
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,020
I don't think he ever forgave me.

483
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,348
- Took it kinda personal, huh?

484
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:39,545
- Yeah, I guess.

485
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:41,075
Hey, but we kinda keep in touch.

486
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:42,705
I send him passes to all the home games.

487
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:46,497
After I met Jennifer, I asked him to bring her to the games.

488
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,423
But I always felt my man had some resentment,

489
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:52,883
either for Jennifer, or football.

490
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:58,470
But hey, time keeps moving, right?

491
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,833
- Yeah.

492
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,963
- Speaking of moving, I got a little thing

493
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:03,792
I gotta go get ready for, you know what I'm saying?

494
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,288
(laughing)

495
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:06,885
- You tell the little thing you gotta go get ready for

496
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:09,213
is that hot mama that just left here.

497
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,238
I don't think you'll ever quite get ready for that, bro.

498
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:15,499
(laughing)

499
00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:33,659
- [Casey] Hello, Mr. Derringer.

500
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:36,021
- You know, I was moving so fast the other day,

501
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:37,916
I didn't get a chance to get your name.

502
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:39,580
- Casey, Casey Woods.

503
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,411
- Casey, hello.

504
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:41,575
- Hi.

505
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:42,573
Listen, I just wanna thank you for what you did for us.

506
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:43,803
You know, because of you,

507
00:29:43,836 --> 00:29:45,932
they didn't get away with anything.

508
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,595
- Well I'm glad I could be of help.

509
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:49,059
Right place, right time.

510
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:51,154
- Well, also, this wasn't just a robbery.

511
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,983
- What do you mean by that?

512
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:53,881
- See, they were there to collect

513
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:55,710
protection money from my father.

514
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,673
He refused, so they were there taking

515
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:59,336
the merchandise for their payment.

516
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,966
- A shakedown, you tell this to the police?

517
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,028
- Yes, yes we did, but what can they do?

518
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,057
Put a 24 hour guard on our store?

519
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,820
I don't think so.

520
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:09,148
Listen, Mr. Derringer, I saw by your card

521
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:10,877
that you're a private investigator.

522
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,139
See, we don't have much money,

523
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,434
but we'd be glad to pay you what we can

524
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,163
if you could please help us.

525
00:30:17,197 --> 00:30:20,822
Maybe you could talk to these people, or something.

526
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:23,748
See, we can't afford to stay in business, and pay them too.

527
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:28,106
- Well, it's hard to refuse a beautiful lady in distress.

528
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:30,134
- Thank you, Mr. Derringer.

529
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:32,796
- Call me Mack. - Thank you, Mack.

530
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,352
Here's my number, maybe you could give me a call later.

531
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:41,110
- I'll do that.

532
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:42,840
- Okay, thank you Mack.

533
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:43,672
Bye.

534
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:44,537
- Bye.

535
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:07,386
- You smell good, Mr. Derringer.

536
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,417
- So do you.

537
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,508
(reggae music)

538
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:56,744
- What are you looking at, Mr. Derringer?

539
00:31:56,778 --> 00:31:59,604
- Well, didn't your mom ever tell you to wear underpants?

540
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:01,134
(laughing)

541
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,828
- Sure, in case of an accident.

542
00:32:03,862 --> 00:32:07,487
But then, I don't believe in accidents.

543
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,283
Do you, Mr. Derringer?

544
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,044
- Guess not.

545
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:27,011
How am I supposed to know this jealous boyfriend?

546
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:28,341
What's he look like?

547
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:30,304
- You'll know him when you see him.

548
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:32,465
- I'm not sure if I like that.

549
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,020
- [Man] Easy.

550
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,113

552
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,338
- [Man] Yeah, they were playing at the Boulevard Cafe.

553
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:23,453
- Why don't you have a drink?

554
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:25,482
I'm gonna go freshen up.

555
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:29,473
- Well, that sounds marvelous to me,

556
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,471
since I'm your bodyguard,

557
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:32,300
that means I get to go everywhere, right?

558
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,825
- I think I'll be okay in the ladies room.

559
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:38,919
- All right.

560
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,338
What a woman.

561
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:01,137
- You think he's too old for her?

562
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,401
- Most definitely.

563
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,462
An old geezer like that.

564
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:06,857
- He's my sugar daddy.

565
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:08,653
- Really?

566
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:10,483
- I'm Nancy Billings.

567
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:11,880
- Mack Derringer.

568
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:14,673
- Have you ever been a sugar daddy, Mr. Derringer?

569
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:17,334
- (chuckling) Not that I know of.

570
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:22,323
- Well, maybe another time, Mr. Derringer.

571
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:24,319
Enjoy.

572
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:36,858
- Mose would like to see you downstairs.

573
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,140
(gunshots)

574
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,418
- [Woman] Jean Claude!

575
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,675
- Okay, let's go over this again.

576
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:32,103
You came in the door, you got hit on the head,

577
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:34,431
and then you came to with a gun in your hand,

578
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:36,626
and a dead man on the bed.

579
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:37,824
- Right. - Wrong.

580
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:39,752
You came in here to steal something, and you got caught,

581
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,615
and that's what really happened, isn't it?

582
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:44,342
- You need a couple of Tic Tacs, pal.

583
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:45,507
Maybe a few.

584
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,737
- Smart ass.

585
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,465

588
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,853
- You just can't seem to stay outta trouble, can ya?

589
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:12,381
All right, give it to me, short and sweet.

590
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:15,109
- Look, somebody hit me on the head,

591
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:17,569
knocked me out, fired a shot, stuck a gun in my hand.

592
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:20,696
When I woke up there was a dead body in front of me.

593
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,293
- Who would do that?

594
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:24,421
- Come on, Ted, if I knew that,

595
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:26,150
I wouldn't be standing here like this.

596
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,080
- What are you doing here?

597
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:33,434
- Some lady hired me to protect her from a boyfriend.

598
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:36,395
- You check this out?

599
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,958
- Yes sir, we looked for this lady,

600
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:41,251
there's nobody here like he described.

601
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:45,009
- Let's go downtown, let's talk about this a little more.

602
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:46,173
Do you mind?

603
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,403
- What about these, huh?

604
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:50,863

606
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,274
- [Mack] Thanks for bailing me out, partner.

607
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:19,001
Listen, I heard the cops say that this guy,

608

610
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,343

Hey, that's Jennifer.

623
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:51,730
- [Mack] In living color.

624
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:56,752
- Hell, and as I live in lust, Francesca, the F word.

625
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:59,479
I liked her better in the car I had.

626
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:01,375
- [Mack] With no underwear.

627
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,366
- [Jake] I'll check for some files.

628
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,232
- [Mack] Right.

629
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:23,693
- We've got files on Jennifer, no Francesca.

630
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:29,546

631

What's that for?

636
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:14,514

637
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:15,379

Left my goddamn gun in the car.

Hey!

651
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,963
- I thought he was on vacation.

652
00:41:22,996 --> 00:41:26,223
- Yeah, so did I.

653
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:29,183

Why you back so soon, man?

659
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:42,887

- Same old story.

664

671
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:05,004

Well, what do you think?

before he was able to distribute the pictures of Nancy.

698

699
00:43:22,234 --> 00:43:24,995
Well, that's probably why those thugs were in that place.

700
00:43:25,028 --> 00:43:26,292

If Mr. Santiago knew you were here, he'd have you killed.

- Like Jean Claude, right?

737
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:54,698
- He took some naughty pictures of me.

738
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:58,889
Santiago hated him, but setting someone up is not his style.

739
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:02,348
- Right, he just tries to beat people up.

740

741

00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:09,898
- Oh.

00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:15,586
No more questions.

744
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:17,981
- Questions is why I came here, sweetheart.

745
00:46:18,014 --> 00:46:20,940
- You're wasting precious time.

746
00:46:20,974 --> 00:46:22,936
- I'm sure you're right.

747
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,326
But I'm interested in another lady, Francesca.

748
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,985
- Now, what can she do for you that I can't do, better.

749
00:46:31,018 --> 00:46:32,881
- I don't know.

750
00:46:32,914 --> 00:46:34,544
We never got that far.

754
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:47,848
She works for some escort service.

755

758
00:46:56,728 --> 00:46:58,956
but it shouldn't be too hard to find.

759
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,052
Not many women around that look like her.

760
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,646

761
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,392

762
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:15,520

868
00:51:45,392 --> 00:51:46,490
What do you mean by that?

869
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,186
- It means that whatever happens to us, happens to them.

870
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:52,011
Like I said, pal, the Woods jewelry store, forget about it.

871
00:51:52,045 --> 00:51:54,938
Oh yeah, one more thing.

872
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:59,993
The Sports Page Club, don't even think about it.

873
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:01,158
- [Amad] I'll kill you.

874
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,023
- 10 kids.

875
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,184
You're quite a stud.

876
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:06,379
Adios.

877
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,448
- Hello.

878
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:21,280
- Hi.

879
00:52:21,313 --> 00:52:22,610
- I was hoping you would call.

880
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:24,140
- Well, I have good news for you.

881
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,901
- No, not just for business.

882
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:28,764
It was really nice to hear from you again.

883
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:32,522
- Well, it's always nice to call a beautiful lady.

884
00:52:32,556 --> 00:52:35,283
But you know those guys that were bothering you?

885
00:52:35,315 --> 00:52:37,511
I went and had a little talk with them.

886
00:52:37,545 --> 00:52:39,307
I don't think they'll bother you again.

887
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:42,467
- Do you always get results this fast, Mack?

888
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,560
- Only when I try really hard.

889
00:52:45,593 --> 00:52:47,057
- All right, well, you tell me your fee,

890
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:48,653
and I'll write you a check.

891
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:50,382
- Nah, that won't be necessary.

892
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,512
Seeing you again will be payment enough.

893
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:55,272
- It was really nice to hear from you again.

894
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,236
- It's my pleasure.

895
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,360
- Shit man, you're still alive.

896
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:02,589
You're running with the models all over the street,

897
00:53:02,622 --> 00:53:04,485
you're one bad dude.

898
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:05,716
How the hell did you get out of the house?

899
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:06,646
Man, what happened?

900
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,243
- Hey, hey, hey, hold on brother,

901
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:09,075
you're the one with all the answers, man,

902
00:53:09,108 --> 00:53:10,472
what you got for me?

903
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:12,334
- This Francesca broad, man, she's a high class hooker.

904
00:53:12,368 --> 00:53:15,327
She has a pad over on North Third Street.

905
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:16,658
It's not a good neighborhood.

906
00:53:16,691 --> 00:53:18,155
But after what you did to the El Rojos,

907
00:53:18,188 --> 00:53:20,151
this should be a piece of cake for you, B.

908
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:21,780
What heard.

909
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:22,878
- Well.

910
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,108
Thank you, partner, I owe you.

911
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:25,305
- Shit man.

912
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:26,370
Oh, excuse me, I know we're in the premise

913
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,033
of a young lady, but Mack, man, I'm telling you,

914
00:53:28,066 --> 00:53:30,195
I'd rather be on this side of you than the other,

915
00:53:30,229 --> 00:53:32,556
because you're one bad MF, word.

916
00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:33,421
My man.

917
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:35,483
I'm out.

918
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:40,838
- Business? - Yeah, serious business.

919
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:43,465
- You will take care, won't you, Mack?

920
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:44,663
- I always do.

921
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,222
- Bye.

922
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:58,732
(slow music)

923
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,529
(dog barking)

924
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:14,000
- Billy boy.

925
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,592
Got you.

926
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,798
(groaning)

927
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:38,180
(yelling)

928
00:56:04,255 --> 00:56:06,484
- How do you like my yacht, Mr. Derringer?

929
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:10,109
125 footer.

930
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:13,003
Lordship, built in Australia.

931
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:15,165
Now begone.

932
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:23,547
Mr. Derringer, you must understand my position.

933
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,604
I don't like anyone interfering with my business.

934
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:28,901
Nothing personal.

935
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:30,631
- It's not personal.

936
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:34,755
I'm just trying to find out who set me up, that's all.

937
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:39,112
- He's lying, he was asking a lot of questions.

938
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,707
- Like I said. (groaning)

939
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:43,868
(laughing)

940
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:46,362
- Look at that, he's got weak knees.

941
00:56:46,396 --> 00:56:50,054
- Violence is not my style, I'm a businessman.

942
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:53,414
Oh, I'm sorry about what happened to you on the yacht.

943
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:55,709
I had nothing to do with it, believe me.

944
00:56:57,338 --> 00:57:01,563
However, now...

945
00:57:01,596 --> 00:57:03,658
You pose a problem.

946
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:08,780
- My problem is, I wanna know who set me up.

947
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:11,441
(laughing)

948
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:14,834
- Look, you're gonna have to excuse Hugo,

949
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,596
he's a very impatient man.

950
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,825
- Let me kill him now, Mr. Santiago.

951
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:23,847
- Mr. Derringer, you're making Hugo very very nervous.

952
00:57:24,046 --> 00:57:26,275
You understand that.

953
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,971
And, I have to do...

954
00:57:30,632 --> 00:57:31,862
What I have to do.

955
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:34,191
- Come on, Mr. Derringer, let's have some fun.

956
00:57:42,373 --> 00:57:45,367
(suspenseful music)

957
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,781
Hey Billy Bob, don't make no sudden stops,

958
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:57,174
or I might slip and make a big mess in the car.

959
00:57:57,206 --> 00:57:59,436
(laughing)

960
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:21,919
(cars honking)

961
00:58:21,952 --> 00:58:22,750
Everybody get away!

962
00:58:22,784 --> 00:58:24,281
Come on, get away!

963
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,141
(laughing)

964
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:45,035
(yelling)

965
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:46,997
- You scared the hell out of me!

966
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:48,228
- Yeah, I can see it all over the seat.

967
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:51,088
Look here, partner, why you so brilliant

968
00:58:51,122 --> 00:58:53,083
that you happen to put this baby in the right place.

969
00:58:53,117 --> 00:58:55,113
How you know I was gonna do this,

970
00:58:55,146 --> 00:58:58,538
run here, and jump in this car at this particular space?

971
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:01,200
- Because you always ran to the left,

972
00:59:01,232 --> 00:59:03,161
everybody on the field knew that,

973
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:04,792
so I just thought I'd park to the left.

974
00:59:04,825 --> 00:59:07,419
- Yeah yeah, right, okay, let's have a drink.

975
00:59:07,452 --> 00:59:08,849
- Yeah, get in!

976
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,969
One man will fight, get in!

977
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,360
- How long you been following me?

978
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:21,920
You some kind of psychic or something?

979
00:59:21,954 --> 00:59:26,377
Nevermind, nevermind, I don't even wanna know.

980
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,338
- Hey, I know you, you're Mack Derringer, right?

981
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,067
- You got it.

982
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,162
- Well I'll be, the greatest defensive back

983
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,257
to play pro football for the 49ers

984
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:36,821
- That's right.

985
00:59:36,854 --> 00:59:38,783
- [Man] They called you The Bruiser, right?

986
00:59:38,817 --> 00:59:40,214
- The man knows football.

987
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:41,112
- The Bruiser!

988
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,509
(laughing)

989
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,570
- This is Lenny.

990
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:45,468
- Hello.

991
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,498
Lenny, Lenny, number 86.

992
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,626
- Number 55.

993
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:50,790
- Right.

994
00:59:50,823 --> 00:59:53,118
- Hey Mack, you're my man, how about an autograph.

995
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:54,981
- You got it.

996
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:57,908
- Hey, since I'm here, can I grab yours too, Benny?

997
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,870
- Sure, you're unzipped.

998
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:03,662
Benny with a B.

999
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,156
- Defensive tackle, right?

1000
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:08,085
- Linebacker.

1001
01:00:08,118 --> 01:00:09,615
- Right, right, well hey, thanks fellas,

1002
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,545
you guys made my day.

1003
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:13,673
Can only be good things after this.

1004
01:00:14,638 --> 01:00:16,400
- Now can we be serious?

1005
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:18,296
I wanna know if you've got this mess figured out yet.

1006
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,690
- No, I don't have it figured out.

1007
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:21,622
- I'm not surprised.

1008
01:00:21,655 --> 01:00:23,085
What's your next move?

1009
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,815
- See a pretty lady.

1010
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:27,143
(laughing)

1011
01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:28,540
- That's good.

1012
01:00:28,573 --> 01:00:29,837
You've got some people trying to kill you,

1013
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,367
not to mention these two new friends we just met,

1014
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:33,562
and you're thinking about getting laid?

1015
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,492
- Can you think of something better?

1016
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:42,941
- No. (laughing)

1017
01:00:42,975 --> 01:00:45,769
- I can understand that after your failure in Jamaica.

1018
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:47,332
- Well we're not in Jamaica now,

1019
01:00:47,366 --> 01:00:48,796
so let's move across the street and get something to drink.

1020
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:49,661
- [Mack] My man.

1021
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:14,372
Forget something?

1022
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:18,996
- You know, I didn't get a chance

1023
01:01:19,029 --> 01:01:20,592
to show you what I had for you.

1024
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:22,255
- [Mack] Oh really?

1025
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:23,120
- Mm-hmm.

1026
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:28,076
It's chilly out here, wanna go inside?

1027
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:29,473
- You got it.

1028
01:01:39,118 --> 01:01:41,846
Maybe a drink will warm you up, okay?

1029
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,109
- [Casey] Sure.

1030
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:56,546
- No wonder you were chilly.

1031
01:01:58,675 --> 01:02:01,069
(slow music)

1032
01:03:58,278 --> 01:04:00,440
(ringing)

1033
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:03,001
- Mack, I've been looking for you everywhere.

1034
01:04:03,035 --> 01:04:04,664
I left messages at the hospital,

1035
01:04:04,697 --> 01:04:06,792
I was hoping you were gonna come here.

1036
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:10,883
- Well, I haven't had time to check my machine lately.

1037
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:14,076
- Look, your mom's on T.V.,

1038
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,141
she's talking about you.

1039
01:04:15,174 --> 01:04:16,770
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

1040
01:04:16,804 --> 01:04:19,199
- [Roland] Mrs. Derringer, we all know

1041
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:20,396
how you must feel about your son.

1042
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,657
- Listen, I know my son didn't do anything wrong,

1043
01:04:22,691 --> 01:04:24,820
that's not the way I raised him.

1044
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:27,115
Mack, son, you be careful out there.

1045
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:29,876
I know you're kicking butt and taking names,

1046
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,472
but you be careful.

1047
01:04:31,505 --> 01:04:33,767
- This is Roland Friedricks, back to you, Larry.

1048
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,164
- I'm not through yet, I'm not finished yet.

1049
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:36,561
And son, I want you to know,

1050
01:04:36,594 --> 01:04:39,255
your mommy is backing you up all the way.

1051
01:04:39,288 --> 01:04:40,752
- Back to you, Larry.

1052
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,414
- [Mama] I, I'm.

1053
01:04:42,448 --> 01:04:44,443
- Way to go, mama.

1054
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:48,002
Can I use your phone?

1055
01:04:48,036 --> 01:04:51,062
- Yeah, sure, it's in there.

1056
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,159
- I remember.

1057
01:04:55,385 --> 01:04:58,446
(upbeat jazzy music)

1058
01:05:02,636 --> 01:05:05,298
(phone ringing)

1059
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:16,439
- Hey Bruiser.

1060
01:05:16,473 --> 01:05:18,302
- Hey, Jake, hey.

1061
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,163
Man, you guys sound like you're having a great time there.

1062
01:05:21,196 --> 01:05:24,322
Look, I need you to make a few calls for me,

1063
01:05:24,356 --> 01:05:28,712
try to find out something about this Billy character.

1064
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:29,577
- Billy?

1065
01:05:30,475 --> 01:05:32,271
- We know that Francesca works

1066
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:34,499
for some kind of escort service.

1067
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:36,994
See if they kept the records on their clients.

1068
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:39,356
Yeah, this Billy must have hired her

1069
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:41,683
to lure me to the party.

1070
01:05:41,717 --> 01:05:43,180
You got all that?

1071
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:44,045
- Got it.

1072
01:05:47,438 --> 01:05:48,502
Right at you.

1073
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:12,050
- You know, George, you're the only guy

1074
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:15,044
I've ever heard of that gets capital punishment.

1075
01:06:15,077 --> 01:06:18,137
Yeah, do you think anybody really misses Ted Bundy?

1076
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,567
Oh, drop dead.

1077
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:21,895
- Hey, partner.

1078
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:22,693
- [Attendant] Yeah?

1079
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:24,224
- I need some conversation.

1080
01:06:24,257 --> 01:06:25,055
- What do I look like?

1081
01:06:25,088 --> 01:06:25,886
A tour guide?

1082
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,549
- Could be.

1083
01:06:27,582 --> 01:06:30,742
I've been checking some escort services around here.

1084
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:34,135
One of them said a Billy called them from here.

1085
01:06:36,596 --> 01:06:38,226
- What's that supposed to do?

1086
01:06:38,259 --> 01:06:40,687
- Help save you from a butt kickin'

1087
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,516
if you don't start being nice to me.

1088
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:45,178
- I'm shaking.

1089
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,141
Know what this is?

1090
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:48,403
It's bulletproof glass, what are you crazy?

1091
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:49,833
What do you think, you're Superman?

1092
01:06:49,867 --> 01:06:51,364
Calm down.

1093
01:06:51,397 --> 01:06:53,392
- [Jake] Bulletproof from this close?

1094
01:06:53,425 --> 01:06:54,590
- Oh, come on, don't.

1095
01:06:54,623 --> 01:06:57,084
Come on, don't even point that thing here, come on man.

1096
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:58,681
Take it east, calm down, now.

1097
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,078
- You got a Billy living here?

1098
01:07:00,111 --> 01:07:01,907
- We've got lots of Billys.

1099
01:07:01,941 --> 01:07:04,268
- God, you've got my money and you're still

1100
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:05,832
treating me like a jerk.

1101
01:07:05,865 --> 01:07:06,696
- I'm not being a jerk.

1102
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,726
Lots of bums come in here using that name.

1103
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:10,522
- Let me see your outgoing phone slips

1104
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:12,051
of the past few days.

1105
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:15,976
- Just don't fool around with that no more.

1106
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:25,888
- How about this one?

1107
01:07:27,185 --> 01:07:28,814
Was this a Billy?

1108
01:07:28,847 --> 01:07:30,378
- Yeah, that's a Billy.

1109
01:07:32,107 --> 01:07:33,205
- Dial the number.

1110
01:07:39,757 --> 01:07:41,087
- [Woman] Escort service.

1111
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,417
- It's an escort service.

1112
01:07:42,451 --> 01:07:43,715
- Bingo.

1113
01:07:43,749 --> 01:07:46,376
What's the room number?

1114
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:47,241
- 102.

1115
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:50,999
- 102.

1116
01:07:55,256 --> 01:07:58,250
(suspenseful music)

1117
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:42,120
1-900-10MIAMI.

1118
01:08:44,714 --> 01:08:45,712
Jennifer.

1119
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:50,402
(door squeaking)

1120
01:08:51,432 --> 01:08:53,595
(gunshot)

1121
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:14,248
(gunshots) (dogs barking)

1122
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,001
Would you be so kind as to move your truck

1123
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:38,296
so I can drive my car?

1124
01:09:38,329 --> 01:09:40,724
- Hey, big man, we're looking for

1125
01:09:40,757 --> 01:09:42,686
the wonder boy, Mack Derringer.

1126
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,017
Where is he?

1127
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,546
- Try the Yellow Pages.

1128
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,309
- Funny man. - Yeah.

1129
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:48,173
- Try this.

1130
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:50,370
(yelling)

1131
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:52,997
- [Hugo] Smart ass, let's go.

1132
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,061
- Get him in the car.

1133
01:09:56,622 --> 01:09:58,119
- [Hugo] Let's go.

1134
01:10:01,545 --> 01:10:03,075
- Hey, Mack.

1135
01:10:03,108 --> 01:10:05,137
- [Mack] Mm-hmm.

1136
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:07,764
- You know that I still love you, right?

1137
01:10:07,797 --> 01:10:10,825
- Yeah, I love you too, sweetheart,

1138
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:13,152
but it's a different kind of love now.

1139
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,374
(phone ringing)

1140
01:10:18,408 --> 01:10:19,705
- Hello?

1141
01:10:19,738 --> 01:10:22,133
- [Billy] Oh, now I know where you live.

1142
01:10:25,857 --> 01:10:26,889
- Who was that?

1143
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,951
- Just a couple of crazies that keep calling me.

1144
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:30,148
- [Mack] Crazies?

1145
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:31,013
- Yeah.

1146
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:33,807
(phone ringing)

1147
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,770
- Oh come on, give me a break.

1148
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:38,729
All right, scumbag, we're getting tired of this crap.

1149
01:10:38,763 --> 01:10:41,623
- [Sam] My, my, such language.

1150
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,785
I have a close friend here,

1151
01:10:43,818 --> 01:10:46,247
and he wants you to come down and play cards.

1152
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:48,807
- What friend?

1153
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:50,537
And who the hell are you?

1154
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,599
- [Sam] I'm Sam, the friend is your old buddy, Jake.

1155
01:10:52,632 --> 01:10:55,392
Hugo and Billy Bob picked him up a little while ago.

1156
01:10:57,555 --> 01:10:58,353
- Where is he?

1157
01:10:58,386 --> 01:10:59,583
And where are you?

1158
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:01,479
- [Sam] Relax, I sent Billy Bob over to pick you up.

1159
01:11:01,513 --> 01:11:06,502
I wouldn't want you to lose your way.

1160
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,996
- [Jennifer] Who is that?

1161
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,750
- I gotta make a run.

1162
01:11:14,784 --> 01:11:16,580
- Where you going?

1163
01:11:16,613 --> 01:11:18,508
- That call was about Jake.

1164
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:21,269
They're holding him to get to me.

1165
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:25,493
- All right, be careful, okay?

1166
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:27,422
- Are you kidding?

1167
01:11:27,456 --> 01:11:31,114
I've been hit on the head, beat up, shot at,

1168
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:34,341
framed for murder, what more can happen to me?

1169
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,205
And why me?

1170
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:03,210
- Don't be a hero, okay, champ?

1171
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:10,993
- Got a piece?

1172
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,556
Give it up.

1173
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,119
- Where's Jake?

1174
01:12:14,153 --> 01:12:15,184
- You'll find out.

1175
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:17,112
- Sorry we can't be here for your reunion,

1176
01:12:17,146 --> 01:12:19,906
but Mr. Santiago's yacht's pulling out tonight.

1177
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,233
- And we don't wanna get blood all over our clothes.

1178
01:12:23,266 --> 01:12:24,131
- Right.

1179
01:12:24,164 --> 01:12:25,095
So long, champ.

1180
01:12:27,025 --> 01:12:28,355
- Shit.

1181
01:12:28,388 --> 01:12:30,650
(groaning)

1182
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,204
(punching)

1183
01:12:43,588 --> 01:12:45,749
(yelling)

1184
01:13:01,948 --> 01:13:03,345
- Jake.

1185
01:13:03,377 --> 01:13:04,874
- Very good, gentlemen.

1186
01:13:04,907 --> 01:13:08,366
You both promised me good entertainment, and you delivered.

1187
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:10,329
Now you both know that the greatest love

1188
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:14,386
that a man can have, is to die for his friend.

1189
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:18,178
Gonna play a little game, have a little fun.

1190
01:13:18,212 --> 01:13:23,167
You're gonna kill him, or you're gonna kill him.

1191
01:13:23,201 --> 01:13:26,893
Or, I'm gonna kill you both.

1192
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,353
Got it?

1193
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:30,218
- I'm gonna die.

1194
01:13:32,014 --> 01:13:34,110
I'm gonna die.

1195
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,039
I can't die.

1196
01:13:36,072 --> 01:13:38,467
I got to have my soul cleansed.

1197
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,795
I got to pray for forgiveness.

1198
01:13:40,828 --> 01:13:43,589
Brother, get down here with me and pray for forgiveness.

1199
01:13:43,622 --> 01:13:44,986
Brother get down here with me.

1200
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:48,146
We got to pray, and we got to ask the Lord to forgive us.

1201
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:49,576
Beat the gentlemen.

1202
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:50,940
Then forgive us for our sins.

1203
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,502
The keys are in the car, if I get it started,

1204
01:13:52,536 --> 01:13:54,265
jump on the back, and ask for forgiveness,

1205
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:57,392
and please, Lord, let it be swift.

1206
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:01,117
And the Bible said, do good unto those

1207
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,747
who hate you, bless you.

1208
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,975
And teach those who love you to hate you more,

1209
01:14:05,009 --> 01:14:07,337
and bless you, and bless you very much!

1210
01:14:11,161 --> 01:14:16,150
(yelling) (tires screeching)

1211
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:24,998
(gunshots)

1212
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:33,147
(laughing)

1213
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:41,329
- Why don't you take me to Jennifer's house?

1214
01:14:41,362 --> 01:14:42,925
I'll check with you later.

1215
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,322
- Well, that little punk,

1216
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,084
Billy, was the one that followed me.

1217
01:14:46,118 --> 01:14:47,847
I went through his room.

1218
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,876
He had her number.

1219
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:53,069
- Yeah, well now there are two of them calling.

1220
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:54,832
- Two?

1221
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:55,697
- Yeah, two.

1222
01:14:57,294 --> 01:14:58,491
Light's changed.

1223
01:14:58,524 --> 01:14:59,355
- Yeah.

1224
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:19,245
- Stay out of trouble, Jake

1225
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,941
Jennifer?

1226
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,232
Jennifer!

1227
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,438
(phone ringing)

1228
01:15:58,292 --> 01:15:59,257
(Jennifer groaning)

1229
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,687
- [Billy] Derringer.

1230
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,851
Now it's time for your wife

1231
01:16:01,884 --> 01:16:05,177
to do all the things she says she loves to do.

1232
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:09,999
(laughing) Soft in all the right places.

1233
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:12,162
- You're a real sicko.

1234
01:16:12,195 --> 01:16:14,025
- [Billy] No more teasin'.

1235
01:16:14,057 --> 01:16:15,322
Now it's time for action.

1236
01:16:15,355 --> 01:16:17,317
Don't move, bitch.

1237
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,610
Oh, you're a bad girl.

1238
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:24,168
- I'm telling you man, if you hurt her--

1239
01:16:24,202 --> 01:16:26,098
- [Billy] You can have fun too,

1240
01:16:26,131 --> 01:16:27,661
just like they talk about on the phone.

1241
01:16:27,694 --> 01:16:29,756
Come on down, she can handle it.

1242
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:32,185
The Foundry warehouse on the river.

1243
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:34,180
Oh, and come alone.

1244
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:24,469
(heavy breathing)

1245
01:17:24,502 --> 01:17:25,301
- Oh.

1246
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:29,025
Oh, Mr. Derringer, welcome, welcome.

1247
01:17:29,059 --> 01:17:29,890
- Mack.

1248
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:32,019
- The worms, they crawl in,

1249
01:17:32,053 --> 01:17:34,747
and the worms, they crawl out.

1250
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,108
Oh, harder, harder, oh yeah.

1251
01:17:37,141 --> 01:17:38,405
Yes.

1252
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:40,068
- Mack.

1253
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:41,565
- Mack.

1254
01:17:41,598 --> 01:17:42,995
- What do you want?

1255
01:17:43,029 --> 01:17:43,959
- What do I want?

1256
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,988
Let me see, what do I want.

1257
01:17:46,022 --> 01:17:50,578
The death of Jennifer Derringer, yes.

1258
01:17:50,612 --> 01:17:55,135
You see, she was pure, and you violated

1259
01:17:55,168 --> 01:18:00,157
the temple of her beauty, and you caused this.

1260
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,918
You, you caused all of this.

1261
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:07,141
(crying)

1262
01:18:07,175 --> 01:18:08,872
- You killed Francesca, right?

1263
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:10,568
- Yeah.

1264
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:11,665
Francesca, and...

1265
01:18:13,794 --> 01:18:18,783
Pebbles, and Jean Claude. (laughing)

1266
01:18:21,177 --> 01:18:23,240
(crying)

1267
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:25,136
Oh, damn baby.

1268
01:18:25,169 --> 01:18:27,497
- [Mack] Let her go.

1269
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,395
- What?

1270
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:30,225
- Let her go.

1271
01:18:30,257 --> 01:18:32,520
- Well, if you insist.

1272
01:18:32,552 --> 01:18:33,351
Hold still, baby.

1273
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:34,947
Oh, hold still, hold still.

1274
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,945
- No.

1275
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:37,409
- Hold still.

1276
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:38,639
- Jennifer!

1277
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,901
(gunshots)

1278
01:18:47,952 --> 01:18:50,181
(gunshots)

1279
01:19:16,788 --> 01:19:19,250
(groaning)

1280
01:19:19,282 --> 01:19:20,846
(laughing)

1281
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:22,875
- Come on, you, come on.

1282
01:19:28,629 --> 01:19:29,460
Come on.

1283
01:19:32,321 --> 01:19:34,483
(yelling)

1284
01:19:38,308 --> 01:19:39,139
go on.

1285
01:20:34,152 --> 01:20:35,282
- About time.

1286
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:39,506
You've been with Jennifer, I'm gonna kill you.

1287
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:41,934
That's a joke.

1288
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:44,395
Sit down, I wanna talk to you about something.

1289
01:20:45,493 --> 01:20:46,490
- Ted--

1290
01:20:46,524 --> 01:20:47,488
- Let me talk, will you please?

1291
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:50,516
Mack, you're always so damn full of yourself.

1292
01:20:54,739 --> 01:20:55,570
You know...

1293
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:03,021
I've been denying my feelings for

1294
01:21:03,054 --> 01:21:05,815
Jennifer for a very long time, I love her.

1295
01:21:07,778 --> 01:21:09,407
- Jennifer's dead.

1296
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:12,467
- That's not funny, Mack.

1297
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,398
- Not meant to be.

1298
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,591
She was killed by Billy tonight.

1299
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:30,660
- How do I love thee, let me count the ways.

1300
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:35,018
- Come on, Ted, put the piece away.

1301
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:38,177
- That's Elizabeth Barrett Browning,

1302
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:40,072
did you know that, Mack?

1303
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,200
- It's you that's been calling Jennifer, right?

1304
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,458
- You didn't love her very well, Mack.

1305
01:21:46,492 --> 01:21:48,953
You really didn't deserve her.

1306
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:52,978
- Come on, put the piece away, Ted.

1307
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:54,740
Let's talk about this.

1308
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,956
Can I give you a ride home?

1309
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:09,774
I'm sorry it had to work out like this.

1310
01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:17,191
You sure you're all right?

1311
01:22:19,253 --> 01:22:20,084
- Yeah.

1312
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:00,928
- I overheard everything.

1313
01:23:00,961 --> 01:23:03,456
He's taking it pretty hard, isn't he.

1314
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:09,542
Well, I think you've got the wrong take on Ted.

1315
01:23:10,906 --> 01:23:12,137
- What do you mean?

1316
01:23:18,456 --> 01:23:20,052
Poetry books?

1317
01:23:20,086 --> 01:23:20,917
- Check 'em out.

1318
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:26,006
I went by Lenny's pad, and he wasn't there.

1319
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:27,802
I let myself in to wait for him.

1320
01:23:27,835 --> 01:23:29,665
I found those.

1321
01:23:30,828 --> 01:23:32,060
- So what are you saying?

1322
01:23:33,123 --> 01:23:35,785
- It was Lenny who was calling Jennifer, not Ted.

1323
01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:39,809
- Man.

1324
01:23:42,969 --> 01:23:44,166
- Hey, where you going?

1325
01:23:45,197 --> 01:23:47,592
- I'm going to end the friendship with Lenny.

1326
01:23:53,512 --> 01:23:56,073
(upbeat music)

1327
01:24:24,045 --> 01:24:25,375
- I'm learning how to speak French.

1328
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:26,739
(speaking French)

1329
01:24:26,772 --> 01:24:28,635
It means very sensitive man.

1330
01:24:28,668 --> 01:24:29,499
- I need to talk to you, pal.

1331
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:30,597
- It has to do with sensitivity.

1332
01:24:30,631 --> 01:24:32,726
- I need to talk to you.

1333
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:34,056
- What about?

1334
01:24:34,089 --> 01:24:36,484
- Talk over there, all right?

1335
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:37,349
- What is this?

1336
01:24:39,112 --> 01:24:40,974
Don't let him upset you I'll be right back.

1337
01:24:41,008 --> 01:24:42,305
I'll be right back.

1338
01:24:42,338 --> 01:24:43,169
What?

1339
01:24:47,926 --> 01:24:48,757
What?

1340
01:24:49,655 --> 01:24:50,487
Now what?

1341
01:24:53,613 --> 01:24:55,077
- You know something, Lenny.

1342
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:58,070
You always were a big dumb jerk.

1343
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,726
I'm gonna kick your butt all over South Beach.

1344
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,411
- How come?

1345
01:25:13,103 --> 01:25:15,465
- You didn't break any laws, pal,

1346
01:25:15,498 --> 01:25:17,493
but you sure screwed up a lot of lives.

1347
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:21,618
- Name one Mack, who's?

1348
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:23,714
- Jennifer.

1349
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:24,545
- Jennifer?

1350
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,274
- So I call a broad.

1351
01:25:26,308 --> 01:25:29,135
You told me you were through with her.

1352
01:25:29,168 --> 01:25:30,964
- We're not talking about a broad man,

1353
01:25:30,998 --> 01:25:32,560
we're talking about Jennifer!

1354
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,855
(punching)

1355
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:40,443
- (laughing) I love this business!

1356
01:25:43,503 --> 01:25:44,301
Okay.

1357
01:25:44,334 --> 01:25:46,364
(laughing)

1358
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:48,625
(groaning)

1359
01:26:12,971 --> 01:26:15,134
(yelling)

1360
01:26:48,293 --> 01:26:50,622
- Anytime you wanna do this again,

1361
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:52,451
you know where to find me.

1362
01:26:54,181 --> 01:26:56,410
(laughing)

1363
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:09,214
(car honking)

1364
01:27:09,247 --> 01:27:11,776
- Hey Bruiser, come on, man.

1365
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:13,538
Come over here, have a drink on me.

1366
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:17,463
(slow reggae music)

1367
01:27:20,522 --> 01:27:22,884
Get some alcohol on those wounds.

1368
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:28,006
How'd it go?

1369
01:27:30,268 --> 01:27:32,197
- I've had better days.

1370
01:27:32,231 --> 01:27:33,294
- He'll get over it.

1371
01:27:34,226 --> 01:27:37,186
He'll get over it, and everything will be everything.

1372
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:40,612
- Yeah yeah yeah, maybe.

1373
01:27:40,645 --> 01:27:41,476
- Maybe?

1374
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:46,599
I remember when we were playing the Chargers.

1375
01:27:46,632 --> 01:27:50,357
Lance Allworth said he was gonna smoke you

1376
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:54,348
for two touchdowns on the Sunday game.

1377
01:27:55,512 --> 01:27:56,976
You didn't see him ever.

1378
01:27:57,009 --> 01:27:58,406
I didn't hear a maybe.

1379
01:27:59,471 --> 01:28:01,865
- Yeah, I remember the game.

1380
01:28:01,898 --> 01:28:03,163
- Yeah, yeah.

1381
01:28:03,196 --> 01:28:04,027
- Yeah.

1382
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:08,018
- Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

1383
01:28:08,052 --> 01:28:09,249
May I join you?

1384
01:28:09,282 --> 01:28:10,912
- Yeah, right.

1385
01:28:10,945 --> 01:28:14,271
You can be Lenny Dawson.

1386
01:28:14,304 --> 01:28:15,501
- Who's Lenny Dawson?

1387
01:28:15,535 --> 01:28:18,063
(laughing)

1388
01:28:18,096 --> 01:28:19,427
- Bambi.

1389
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,983
The League's leading passed receiver.

1390
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:29,006
Can The Bruiser, the greatest defensive back

1391
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:34,260
ever to play the game of football stop The Bruiser!

1392
