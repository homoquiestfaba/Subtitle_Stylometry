(woman crying out)

7
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,102
- Ow, damn you, you're hurting me!

8
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:02,492
(hand smacks)

00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,204
(woman crying)

10
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,618
No, no, no!

11
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,901
(Woman screaming)

12
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,627
- Here lookie, lookie.

13
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:20,294
(woman screams)

14
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:25,198
(engine rumbles)

15
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,089
(car honks)

16
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:34,454
- Hey, how you doing Miss Chism?

17
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,802
Oh, fine, fine, fine.

18
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:39,582
No, that's all right,
I'll find another job.

19
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:40,644
Darrell?

20
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,094
I just, I dropped them off a while ago.

21
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:44,403
He said he's going to run some errands

22
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:47,060
and then I'm going to pick them up now.

23
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,902
Yeah, I hope he's not up
to one of his capers also.

24
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:54,153
Anyway, you want me to tell him anything?

25
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:56,284
I'll take care of him,
don't worry about it.

26
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:58,983
All right, Miss Chism,
I'll tell him you love him.

27
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,150
You take care.

28
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:07,936
- Okay everybody Mr. Bunch is on his way,

29
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:09,077
we're gonna get started.

30
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:12,160
(suspenseful music)

31
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,867
So why don't you take your robes off

32
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:21,765
and keep the energy going?

33
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:23,136
Great, you're here.

34
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,765
Why don't you go on and take your place?

35
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,765
(suspenseful music)

36
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:34,910
(camera clicks)

37
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,910
(suspenseful music)

38
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:43,347
(camera clicks)

39
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:46,347
(suspenseful music)

40
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:51,694
(camera clicks)

41
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:54,694
(suspenseful music)

42
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:56,814
(camera clicks)

43
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:59,814
(suspenseful music)

44
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:05,892
Kay, got everything ready
for you, it's all yours.

45
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:09,642
- Good and a very good
morning to you ladies.

46
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:16,248
Hello, nice to see you again, Wendy.

47
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:20,305
Well, a little overdressed aren't we?

48
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:22,213
(Dick chuckles)

49
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,796
Absolutely outstanding my dear.

50
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,588
Oh, me Tarzan, you Jane eh?

51
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,304
(Dick laughs)

52
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:34,213
Okay, is it warm enough for you?

53
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:37,504
Well, you're certainly warming me up.

54
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,171
(Dick chuckles)

55
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,495
Suzan, follow me.

56
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,245
(dramatic music)

57
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,573
(camera clicks)

58
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,323
(dramatic music)

59
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,916
- The jap, move her a little to the left

60
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,779
- Her name is Tana Wu, Dick.

61
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,300
She's Chinese.

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,030
- Oh, I'm sorry, my mistake.

63
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,758
Would you kindly ask the
chink to move to her left?

64
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:16,580
- Joey, have Tana move
to the left, please?

65
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,413
- Can we stop screwing around?

66
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:20,036
Are we ready to do this or not?

67
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:20,869
Chuck?

68
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:22,999
- It's Frank

69
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,154
- Whatever.

70
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,284
- Whenever you say Mr. Bunch.

71
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:28,691
- Oh, I say, I say, I say, damn,

72
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:30,992
thing's costing me a fortune already.

73
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:34,043
- Ready to roll, okay,
everybody, this is a take.

74
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:36,460
Joey, Phil, fog up the rooms.

75
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:40,264
Ready with playback.

76
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,097
Roll tape.

77
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:45,152
Action on the set.

78
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:47,902
(dramatic music)

79
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,934
- [Narrator] In his wildest fantasy,

80
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,232
he's certain you're the star.

81
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:56,065
(dramatic music)

82
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,751
Relentless, a new sensation for the body.

83
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,306
Hypnotic, alluring.

84
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,953
Downright uncontrollable.

85
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,443
(set banging)
(dramatic music)

86
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,224
- What the hell's going on?

87
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:23,057
(women screaming)

88
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,682
What the hell's going on here?

89
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,774
(suitcase thuds)

90
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:35,607
Hey you!

91
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:41,494
Who the hell's that asshole?

92
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:44,786
You two, here.

93
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,374
Go get that guy.

94
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:50,207
Go on.

95
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,262
- Dick, this one looks like she
needs to go to the hospital.

96
00:07:58,262 --> 00:07:59,232
- Oh God.

97
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:00,558
As if I need that right now?

98
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:03,782
Look, make her a cup of
tea and call her a cab

99
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:07,403
and call my attorney, just in case.

100
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,184
(Dick coughs)

101
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:12,934
(dramatic music)

102
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,837
- He's gotta be down there somewhere!

103
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:32,587
(dramatic music)

104
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:58,149
Where the hell did he go?

105
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,051
Call Dick.

106
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,614
- Come on Darrell, God dammit.

107
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:07,281
(phone beeping)

108
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:12,172
(metal creaking)

109
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:15,172
(suspenseful music)

110
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,100
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait!

111
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,397
- Jesus Christ Darrel, what's going on?

112
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,707
- Drive, drive, drive!

113
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:27,707
(suspenseful music)

114
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:31,987
- Careful, you don't know what's in it.

115
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,384
- Easy, I do know,
there's nothing in here.

116
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,547
There's nothing in here
except an old newspaper,

117
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:40,179
a crossword puzzle, and a stupid pen.

118
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,418
Look, I wouldn't worry about it.

119
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:42,826
It was probably just some dirty

120
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:45,066
pervert looking to sell
some dirty pictures.

121
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:45,899
- Yeah, yeah.

122
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:46,857
- And what more you have?

123
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:47,690
- Fine, fine, okay.

124
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,195
We'll just get everything set up again

125
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:53,259
cause I want to go home
sometime this week.

126
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,926
- You're so focused.

127
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:58,088
- Oh, did you get him?

128
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,728
- No, but don't worry about it.

129
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,259
He didn't see anything.

130
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,546
- Shit.

131
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:05,185
- Forget that, plane
landed an hour ago Dick.

132
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,018
- Oh yeah?

133
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:06,851
- Yeah.

134
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,038
- Oh, well good.

135
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,118
- They're very pleased.

136
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,768
They want another shipment
as soon as possible.

137
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:12,099
- Good, that's fine.

138
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,993
Well, there's plenty to
go around here right?

139
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:15,951
- Yeah.

140
00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:17,465
Did you get a chance
to look at that video?

141
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:18,298
- What?

142
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,025
- Those two girls for the hairspray spot?

143
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:20,858
- Yeah, yeah.

144
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:23,145
They was, they was both okay.

145
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:25,555
- Which one you want to go with?

146
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,886
- Well, Manny, my man, that depends,

147
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:31,719
which one of them wants
to, you know, with me?

148
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:33,753
- Gotcha.

149
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:36,586
- Yeah, God, I love this business.

150
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:44,197
(dramatic music)

151
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,757
(engine rumbles)

152
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,914
(car door bangs)

153
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:12,850
- Eric, Just hear me
out for just one second.

154
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,058
- No, Darrel, no!

155
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:15,117
I don't, I heard it the whole way home.

156
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,376
I don't want to hear about it.

157
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,124
- Eric, you will not believe
what I'm working on right now.

158
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:20,765
Okay, I am in the big league.

159
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,173
I'm on, I'm on top of the game.

160
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,300
- The last time he went on top of the game

161
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,239
it cost me 1500 bucks to
bail your out of jail.

162
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,436
- Money well spent if you asked me.

163
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,200
- Yeah, well I didn't think so.

164
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,533
I can't afford to do it
again, especially right now.

165
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,016
- Anyway, Eric, don't worry
about that, all right?

166
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:42,925
I mean, you're one of the
best ad men in the business.

167
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,950
You were working at
the top agency in town.

168
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,376
- Yeah, until they gave a
promotion to the boss's nephew.

169
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,626
Oh, their loss.

170
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,691
I would have quit too.

171
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:00,363
- Five years, five years Darrel.

172
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,096
I'm telling you, man, the only way

173
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:07,179
to get ahead is to go into
business for yourself.

174
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,169
- It's always been my policy.

175
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,514
So what's your plan?

176
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:27,410
- I want to start my own ad agency.

177
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,120
I figured it'll take, it'll
take about a hundred grand.

178
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,030
I'm just a little short.

179
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,113
- How short?

180
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:38,554
- About a hundred grand.

181
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:42,232
- Sounds to me like you're
in the market for a job, huh?

182
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:43,482
That's perfect.

183
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,779
But that's why I'm here.

184
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,302
I am on a really heavy case right now

185
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,474
and I need you're help.

186
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:51,150
- No, no way, no way man.

187
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,424
- Come on, at least hear me out.

188
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:54,799
- No, no, Darrel, look man.

189
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,844
You're the one that should
be out looking for a job.

190
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,082
You got to get out of this,
this window peeping business.

191
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:01,822
- I like being a PI.

192
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,959
- Well, let me tell you something man.

193
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,143
That can be very dangerous

194
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:06,754
and you're not, you're
not exactly James Bond.

195
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:09,635
You're, I mean, you kind of a klutz.

196
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:11,656
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't mean
to hurt your feelings but.

197
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,840
(dramatic music)

198
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,757
Who's that?

199
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,711
- Caitland Montague,
age 20, she's missing.

200
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:26,504
I was hired to find her by
her father, Monte Montague.

201
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:30,613
- Monte Montague, the billionaire?

202
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,485
- [Darrel] That's right.

203
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,384
- He hired you to find her?

204
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:35,621
- That's right.

205
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,045
Right place and the right time.

206
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,062
I had a friend on the inside

207
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:40,869
and I ain't going to blow this one.

208
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,066
- What happened to her?

209
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,612
- They don't have a clue.

210
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:45,300
She just disappeared.

211
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
But in the last few
days I traced her steps

212
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,668
to a place called Visions Advertising.

213
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:52,077
And that's where all of a sudden they end.

214
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:52,910
- Visions?

215
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,567
I've heard of them, they're sleazy.

216
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,400
- Yeah.

217
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,677
Visions is owned by a
guy named Dick Bunch.

218
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:01,929
This scumbag has a criminal
record a mile long,

219
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,429
usually involving smuggling.

220
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,324
See, I think he's back in the business

221
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,797
and he's using this whole
agency as a coverup.

222
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:10,111
- What does that have to
do with the missing girl?

223
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,032
- Here's how it ties in.

224
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,294
See, I got lucky.

225
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:13,746
I found one of her old boyfriends

226
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:15,442
and he told me that she left him

227
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,009
for a guy at visions who promised her

228
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,907
he was going to go to this great gig.

229
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:20,465
He was going to make her a supermodel,

230
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:23,287
but want to talk to the
people at visions, guess what?

231
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:24,974
No one remembered her.

232
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:28,250
They said that they see a lot of girls.

233
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,199
- And what does this have to do with me?

234
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,184
- I'm going to need your help

235
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,855
to find out what's really going on.

236
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:34,970
- How?

237
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,585
- Look, I need some
insight info on these guys

238
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,724
and they just happened to need

239
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,191
a guy in their creative department.

240
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:42,466
You obviously need a job,
it's a perfect match.

241
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,887
- No, no, no, no way.

242
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:44,720
- [Darrel] Eric.

243
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,835
- No, no man.

244
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,522
N-O, I'm not.

245
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:48,949
- Eric, you have the credibility man,

246
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:50,280
they will hire you in a second.

247
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,117
It's for me, for me, please.

248
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:52,950
- No

249
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,950
Darryl, N-O.

250
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:58,765
- All right look, I will pay
you a hundred bucks okay?

251
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:03,059
Just go apply for the job, bug the office.

252
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,023
- What?

253
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:05,799
Bug the office?

254
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,090
What if I get caught?

255
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,510
- God, Erin, you're such a pussy.

256
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,410
You have a black belt.

257
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,273
- I'll tell him that.

258
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:15,735
I'll tell them that when
they put the gun to my head.

259
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:20,019
- Eric, this girl is
in real trouble, okay?

260
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,686
I mean, we could really
be saving her life.

261
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,938
I'll pay you 150 bucks.

262
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,337
Every minute counts.

263
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,398
- All right, all right.

264
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,529
Just go make the appointment, all right?

265
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,529
- I already did, thanks.

266
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:43,468
(Eric sighs)

267
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:46,218
(dramatic music)

268
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,577
- [Caitland] Hi darling.

269
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:53,599
I've been thinking about our talk.

270
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,660
Maybe you're right.

271
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,660
This modeling thing, I mean
it just isn't working out.

272
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,492
I'd like to talk about it on Thursday,

273
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,409
when we meet for lunch.

274
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:07,022
Daddy, I miss you.

275
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,176
Bye.

276
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,009
(dramatic music)

277
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,350
- I waited for her.

278
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,874
Caitland never showed up.

279
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:26,559
She would've called me by now.

280
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,215
I was going to make it all up to her.

281
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:31,419
(dramatic music)

282
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:32,919
It's all my fault.

283
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,869
- I don't understand how sir.

284
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,787
- [Caitland] Stop telling me what to do.

285
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:43,657
This is not your decision,
this is my decision.

286
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:45,011
- Caitland be reasonable.

287
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,327
- It's the first time daddy it's not

288
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:48,628
about you and your money.

289
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,186
It's about me.

290
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:51,678
The photographers love me.

291
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,807
- They love the fact
that you're a Montague.

292
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,714
- I don't need your name to prove myself.

293
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,874
- Caitland, Caitland, honey, honey,

294
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,937
now look, this, this modeling thing.

295
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,858
What does it amount to?

296
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:05,191
It's, it's loathsome, it's troublesome.

297
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,094
It's mired with disappointment.

298
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,621
Look, I made you better than that.

299
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:16,295
You can't do this, you won't do it.

300
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,013
- Oh yes I will,

301
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,579
and there is nothing
you can do to stop me.

302
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,835
- All you're going to do
is embarrass yourself.

303
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,913
You're going to take our
good name and make it--

304
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:26,746
- What?

305
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,008
- A punchline for Wall Street pundits.

306
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,841
- Pundits?

307
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,706
You can't even talk to me
like a real father okay?

308
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:37,539
Pundits!

309
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:42,168
- I won't let you make it out there.

310
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:46,006
Pride, pride and control.

311
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:54,465
Tools to build an empire, but
weapons to destroy a dynasty.

312
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,036
I pushed her and I pushed her

313
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:02,234
and she finally found the door.

314
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:08,517
I'm afraid the worst has
happened and it's all my fault.

315
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:09,831
- How's that?

316
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:14,831
- She always knew how to get
to me, right down to my soul.

317
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,255
(Monty sighs)

318
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:19,922
She defied me all through
her teenage years,

319
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:25,351
she taunted me with her
parties, her drinking.

320
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,601
Her boyfriends.

321
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:37,037
I tried to lead her towards a better path,

322
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:40,037
but as always she had her own ideas.

323
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,248
- We'll do everything we can.

324
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:47,971
(dramatic chord)

325
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,721
(dramatic music)

326
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,662
- It was so lucky to get this place

327
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:06,679
right below Vision's office.

328
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,865
The last tenant actually
had a heart attack.

329
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,434
He died right on his desk.

330
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,184
Is that luck or what?

331
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:14,147
Here we are.

332
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,959
Oh, check this out, let
me show you something.

333
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,209
See this watch?

334
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,810
A piano wire.

335
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:27,485
This thing could do some
serious damage, here.

336
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,300
- A nuclear detonator?

337
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,522
- Better, this pen right here

338
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:38,449
is carrying about a hundred
CCS of metformin hydrochloride.

339
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,516
You just hold it to your mouth and blow,

340
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:44,481
the guy'll be out 10 seconds flat, here.

341
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:46,314
Hey, don't suck, blow.

342
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:52,542
Where's my bug, where's my bug?

343
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,662
- Darrel, where do you get this stuff?

344
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,162
- PI's holy bible.

345
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:01,425
Where do you think the
movies get their ideas?

346
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,258
- I should have known.

347
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,792
- Oh shit.

348
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,788
- What is it?

349
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:12,109
- I don't know man.

350
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:13,445
- The same guy was hanging outside

351
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,822
of Avalon studios yesterday.

352
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:20,822
- It's just probably a coincidence,
you're getting paranoid.

353
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:22,741
I could be wrong.

354
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,205
- All right, check this out.

355
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:30,372
Here is the bug all right?

356
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,575
It's on now.

357
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,349
When you're ready to plant it
just peel the adhesive cover,

358
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:38,299
and you're ready to roll all right?

359
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,755
Let's synchronize our watches.

360
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,180
You got to go, time for the appointment,

361
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,317
let's go, let's go, let's go.

362
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,609
Now listen.

363
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:49,298
I'll be with you every
step of the way all right?

364
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,194
If it gets hairy, I'll be there

365
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:54,339
so fast they won't know what hit them.

366
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,747
- You're a dangerous,
dangerous man Darrel.

367
00:20:57,747 --> 00:20:59,786
- Believe that.

368
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:01,703
Hey, make me proud man.

369
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:09,209
(gun clatters)

370
00:21:16,397 --> 00:21:19,230
(dramatic music)

371
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,759
- Dick, listen if you're so nervous

372
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,982
about that pervert why don't
you let me call the police?

373
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:10,347
- No way, do you hear me, no way okay?

374
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,180
- All right, all right.

375
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,692
- I've got enough problems,
all right, all rght?

376
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:13,525
- All right.

377
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:15,051
- Hello girls.

378
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,472
Okay, good to see you,
glad you could make it.

379
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:18,836
Just going to spend a penny, you know.

380
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,919
(suspenseful music)

381
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:39,200
- Oh my God!

382
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,281
(Susan screams)

383
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:43,698
(gun firing)

384
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,516
- Oh shit, oh shit.

385
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:52,460
(gun firing)

386
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:57,493
(dramatic music)

387
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,152
- Are you okay?

388
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:11,703
- Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

389
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:12,953
What about you?

390
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:18,650

391
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,983
- I'm Eric Down.

392
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:24,611
- Dick Bunch the visionary of Visions.

393
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:31,117
Eric, I'm certainly glad you
came across when you did.

394
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:32,868
- Dick, what the hell is going on?

395
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:33,976
- What does it look like stupid?

396
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:36,529
Some guy just tried to kill me.

397
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,029
Well get security.

398
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,772
- God, you were really incredible.

399
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:44,355
- Suzan, Suzan, that is enough.

400
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:51,982

Come on everybody, back

408
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:16,549
It was only a car backfiring,
all right, you okay?

409
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:19,909
Suzan, put the kettle
on and get me vallum,

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,290

So Eric eh?

00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:27,027
You've met Sam.

413
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,437
- No not officially, hi Eric, I'm Sam.

414
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:32,270
Thank you so much for being there.

415
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:35,317
- You're welcome.

416
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:36,150
My pleasure.

417
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,062
- I just talked to security,
they said he got away

418
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,614
but I'll have them go
ahead and call the police.

419
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:40,989
Okay?

420
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,009
It's the right things to do.

421
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:44,904
- Well guys, my break times over,

422
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:46,510
I better get to my meeting.

423
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,760
- You sure you're up to it?

424
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,870
Here, feel my heart all right?

425
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,902
- I'm fine Dick.

426
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:55,987
Thanks again, oh, and
good luck with the job.

427
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:56,987
- Thank you.

428
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:01,446
- Sight men like that I don't need.

429
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:03,518
America is so violent.

430
00:25:03,518 --> 00:25:05,018
Come to my office.

431
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:13,018
Yeah, take a seat.

432
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:19,210
Well, let's see your portfolio.

433
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,543
I mean look, me hands are still shaking.

434
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,293
So what we got?

435
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:34,552
Swiss mouthwash, Carnegie
Insurance and a Fox Cosmetics.

436
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:44,981
Yeah well, very nice but
they're all boring eh?

437
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:48,648
Now let me tell you
something about visions.

438
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:54,015
We believe in getting
down to the bottom line,

439
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:58,265
excite your public, make
them want what you've got.

440
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,137
And if the ads a little controversial,

441
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,861
so much the better.

442
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:11,702
So Eric let us now take a
minute to see how you think.

443
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,506
Take this (speaking in foreign language).

444
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:22,203
Wong Lee's world of clown,

445
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:24,402
off the top of your head what ideas

446
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:26,485
can you come up for this?

447
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:33,573
- Ooh, try another one,
just try another one.

448
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:39,892
- All right then.

449
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,458
Well how about Thermics Medicated Shampoo?

450
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,994
- The action starts when you get wet.

451
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:00,757
- Yeah, I like it, yeah.

452
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,090
Yeah, very nice.

453
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:07,447
So what you got there then?

454
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:11,346
Hey?

455
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:12,179
- What?

456
00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:16,630
- No blue jeans?

457
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,447
That's un American.

458
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:23,447
You see Eric we also represent
the Growls Jeans account.

459
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:26,926
And I'll tell you what,
I want you to come up

460
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:31,079
with a presentation for a
whole new campaign for them.

461
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,162
What you say?

462
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:38,353
- Excuse me guys, I'm sorry to interrupt.

463
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:41,224
I got a run and rip up these prints.

464
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,048
- That's fine, come here, come here.

465
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:45,268
Eric here is gonna work
on the Jeans account.

466
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:46,101
- Hey, fantastic.

467
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,144
- Yeah.

468
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:50,144
You see Sam is our Growl Jeans girl.

469
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:52,540
Aren't you?

470
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,542
- Well great, we're gonna
be working together.

471
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,427
- Mr. Bunch.

472
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,260
- Yeah?

473
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,342
- Can I see you for a second.

474
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,643
- No, give us ten minutes.

475
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,410
- I'm afraid it can't wait.

476
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,029
- Give me a second.

477
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:10,935
Sam why don't you and Eric make a plan

478
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:14,065
to discuss our ideas for
the product, all right?

479
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,148
- Okay, sure.

480
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:22,293
- Oh hang on, did you say
you'd take the position?

481
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:27,217
- Yeah, yeah.

482
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,582
- Terrific.

483
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:33,079
Listen, I'm up against
the wall on this one,

484
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,011
everyone shooting at me today.

485
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:38,594
I'll need something by
10 o'clock tomorrow.

486
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:40,860
- Tomorrow?

487
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:44,049
Okay.

488
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,118
- Good, okay.

489
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:46,368
So collaborate.

490
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:52,209
- Eric unfortunately
I'm booked solid today,

491
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,465
doesn't give us much time to get together.

492
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:57,622
- Why don't we get together tonight?

493
00:28:57,622 --> 00:28:58,455
My place.

494
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,696
- You're place?

495
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:04,961
Sure, okay, how about eight o'clock?

496
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:07,567
- Great.

497
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:08,550
Here, I'll give you the address.

498
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,550
- All right.

499
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,516
- I don't have a pen.

500
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,290
- Now what's the matter?

501
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,975
- Our Middle Eastern friends are in town.

502
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:20,164
- Amir from London?

503
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,063
- Yeah.

504
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:22,490
- Well what's she doing here?

505
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,583
- I don't know, they just said that

506
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,839
they wanna get together tomorrow at 11:30.

507
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,422
- This is bullshit.

508
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:33,600
Well next time we're gonna
need some kind of notice.

509
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,614
We'll tell security to
put and extra guard on.

510
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:40,550
Oh Manny, Manny have this
guy Eric checked out.

511
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,550
Make sure he's for real.

512
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,786
(dramatic music)

513
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,882
- Oh man, that was great!

514
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:55,400
I heard everything, everything,
it was like I was there.

515
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,190
- That's great, yeah you son of a bitch,

516
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,308
where the hell were you?

517
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,838
- And you, you took the
job, I can't believe it.

518
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:03,423
- Yeah I took the job for my own reasons.

519
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:04,506
- So I heard.

520
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,667
- Oh I forgot, yeah, yeah,
you heard everything.

521
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,261
It was like you were there!

522
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:10,163
- So what'd she look like?

523
00:30:10,163 --> 00:30:12,523
Come on, come on, what she look like?

524
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:13,773
- She was nice.

525
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:16,135
She was very nice.

526
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:22,796
- Baby, see, see, I watch
your back, you watch hers.

527
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:23,745
Everybody's happy.

528
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:24,578
- Shut up.

529
00:30:27,664 --> 00:30:28,610
You know you failed to mention that

530
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,050
somebody's trying to kill Dick.

531
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,645
- I didn't know but this is exactly

532
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:33,449
the kind of information I need.

533
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:35,987
You know you should consider
working for me full time.

534
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,591
- What are you crazy?

535
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:38,434
- Why is that so crazy?

536
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:40,748
There's good money in this business.

537
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:41,581
After you.

538
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:45,421
Look at the progress you

539
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:48,625
boom we're already in
and we're sitting pretty.

540
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,882
- Yeah, boom, I almost get shot Darrel.

541
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,918
- [Bunch] And in the
light of our camel jockey

542
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,311
friends being in town,

543
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,580

544
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,418
- [Manny] I don't know.

545
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:58,609
- I'm not going to take no chances.

546
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:03,192
I'm calling Abib to find out
what the hell is going on.

547
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:05,476
Yeah, hello?

548

562
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:41,610
- [Manny] Eight o'clock.

563
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,917
- [Bunch] Eight o'clock

564
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:46,985
- Yes, yes, we got him man, we got him!

565
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,902
- Take care, you take care to, bye.

566
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:54,590
So there we are, business as usual.

567
00:31:56,098 --> 00:32:00,669
Well that's good so what
time does the plane leave?

568
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,916
- [Manny] 4:55 from McCarran.

569
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,571
- [Bunch] Everything's been taken care of?

570
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:06,324
- [Manny] I can assure you,
everything's been handled.

571
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,261
- I can't believe this.

572
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:11,137
We nailed him man, like that, so fast.

573
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,466
Hey, you got to admit,
we make an awesome team.

574
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,125
- Yeah, well how exactly
have we nailed him?

575
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,045
- Yeah, Sergeant Harris please.

576
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,271
Thanks.

577
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,875
What, does a house have to fall on you?

578
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,041
Didn't you listen?

579
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,284
She's delivering a shipment of drugs man.

580
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:27,663
They're using these girls as couriers.

581
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:30,133
- Why would, why would
Kathy be running drugs?

582
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,018
- That's the rub, she wouldn't.

583
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,645
You see, we bust Dick, we find Caitland.

584
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:35,605
Yeah Jack.

585
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:38,607
Yeah, Darrell, listen got a little

586
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,549
piece of information for you.

587
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:43,727
Yeah, how'd you'd like to bust Dick Bunch?

588
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:47,004
No, no you know, the guy
told you about last week.

589
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:48,431
Yeah right, well, listen,

590
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:50,578
there's a drug deal going down today

591
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:53,397
at McCarran airport 4:30 Stella airlines.

592
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:54,959
No shit.

593
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:55,842
Yeah, it'll probably get you

594
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,126
those Lieutenant bars you wanted.

595
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,376
Okay, I'll see you at 4:30.

596
00:33:02,218 --> 00:33:03,176
(phone bangs)

597
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:07,093
Let's roll dude, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

598
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,040
(engine rumbles)

599
00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:23,905
Shit, where's Jack?

600
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:26,498
- Hey, that guy with the blonde

601
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:28,831
that's, that's Dick's buddy.

602
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:40,173
- That must be Kathy.

603
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:42,684
- All right, when you land in London,

604
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:44,207
there's going to be a
guy to meet you there.

605
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,913
His name's Abe Safier.

606
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:47,539
He'll get you to your contact over there,

607
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,908
he'll also take care of
all your arrangements,

608
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,852
hotel, personal phone calls.

609
00:33:51,852 --> 00:33:52,685
- Great.

610
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:53,518
- Whatever.

611
00:33:53,518 --> 00:33:54,351
- Okay.

612
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,184
- Okay.

613
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,017
- Terrific.

614
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,300
- All right then.

615
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,201
I guess I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

616
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,135
- Okay, great.

617
00:33:59,135 --> 00:33:59,968
- Good luck.

618
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:00,801
- Thanks Manny.

619
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:01,634
- Break a leg.

620
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:02,551
- Bye bye.

621
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:05,615
- Oh shit, he's leaving,
come on, let's get him.

622
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:07,210
- No, no, Darrel, Darrel, come on.

623
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,865
Look, let's wait for
the police to get here.

624
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:10,777
We know where to find him.

625
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:13,110
It's it's her worried about.

626
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:20,589
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

627
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,663
Jack, Jack over here.

628
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:28,496
- What do you got Darrel?

629
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:29,329
- She's right over there.

630
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:30,804
We got to grab her before
she boards the plane.

631
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:31,637
- She, who's she?

632
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:32,824
I thought we were here to bust Dick Bunch.

633
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,260
- We are, she's his courier.

634
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,093
Come on.

635
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:35,926
- Go over there check to see

636
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:38,593
if there's any luggage, come on.

637
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:44,894
- Just a minute sister.

638
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:46,417
- Ow, let go of me!

639
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,455
- Darrel, we'll handle
it from here please.

640
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,655
We have reason to believe
you have narcotics

641
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,488
on your possession,

642
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,055
we'd like to check your bag, now Micheal.

643
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:52,958
- What?

644
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,756
Hey, I'm going to miss my plane.

645
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:56,386
- Where's that flight to Miss Chanel?

646
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,630
- To London for a job.

647
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,887
I'm a model and if I
don't make that plane,

648
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:03,399
I'm going to be out of that job.

649
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,989
- There's nothing here Sarge.

650
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:05,913
- [Man] Jack!

651
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:06,909
- Yeah Bobby, what do you got?

652
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,496
- The woman said the only things
she's carrying is her bag.

653
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:10,329
- See?

654
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,162
- [Jack] Jesus.

655
00:35:11,162 --> 00:35:12,044
- Now can I have my bag and go now?

656
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,753
- Just a minute, Jack, please, please.

657
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:15,344
I know that she's caring, okay?

658
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:17,743
Only an idiot would
carry in her travel bag.

659
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:18,642
- And if you're wrong, Darrel?

660
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:20,199
- Jack I'm not okay.

661
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:23,277
I will, I will stake
my reputation on this.

662
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:25,764
Okay, we have to strip search her.

663
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:26,597
- What?

664
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:27,847
- Jesus Christ.

665
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:30,718
You're nuts, I only
have your word on this.

666
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:32,676
- Look, I'm going to miss my plane.

667
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:36,253
- Jack, please I have a very
reliable source on this one.

668
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:37,170
- Like who?

669
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:40,738
- I can't divulge right now.

670
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,633
- All right, that's it
you wanna search me?

671
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,276
Okay fine there?

672
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,063
Is that what you wanted to see?

673
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,146
Can I go now?

674
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:49,146
- Give her the bag back.

675
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,554
I'm sorry for the delay Miss Chanel.

676
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:51,512
- Not half as sorry as you're

677
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,345
gonna be when I call your captain.

678
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:57,791
- Jack, you let her go.

679
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,567
- Darrel, you see that ass?

680
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,692
You thinks he's got a pound
of cocaine stuck up there?

681
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,194
I don't give a shit.

682
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,607
It's the stuff coming
in I'm worried about.

683
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:06,774
Let's go guys.

684
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:13,570
Darrel do me a favor, stop
playing cop and stop calling me.

685
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:16,725
- Man.

686
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,262
I don't get it.

687
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,595
What screwed up?

688
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:24,533
- Someday you'll have to let me know.

689
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:27,116
This is where I get off Darrel.

690
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:34,204
(dramatic music)

691
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:40,002
(Darrel sighs)

692
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,948
- [Woman] Tell them, tell him Caitland.

693
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:52,250
Listen very carefully Mr. Montague.

694
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,500
- They don't wanna hurt me.

695
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:58,071
They want money daddy.

696
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:00,028
- [Woman] How much?

697
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:02,861
(Caitland crying)

698
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:06,169
- 20 million dollars.

699
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:11,644
- [Woman] No police, no
negotiations, no fucking around.

700
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,589
You got that daddy?

701
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:14,422
- Daddy.

702
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:21,868
- Monty, I know what you're going through.

703
00:37:21,868 --> 00:37:25,010
Caitland was like a sister to me,

704
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,092
but these guys are going to screw up

705
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:28,229
and when they do that's when
we're going to make our play.

706
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,485
- I'll tell you exactly
how are we going to play

707
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,152
it plain and simple.

708
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:33,367
I'll pay.

709
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:35,862
- Don't you even want to
discuss this first sir?

710
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:38,665
- We have no time to discuss this.

711
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:39,498
- How the hell do you plan

712
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:41,596
on getting $20 million
together in two hours?

713
00:37:41,596 --> 00:37:44,790
- I can do that and by playing it simple,

714
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:49,227
I mean just that, we do it
exactly the way they said it.

715
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:51,810
- Monty come on, be reasonable.

716
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:57,773
- No police, no negotiations,
no fucking around.

717
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:59,690
I'll make the delivery.

718
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:04,664
(doorbell rings)

719
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:06,611
- Hey.

720
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:07,444
- Hey.

721
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:08,277
How you doing?

722
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,110
- Good, thanks.

723
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,943
- Great, have a seat.

724
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:11,037
- Okay.

725
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,245
- [Eric] Can I get you some wine?

726
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:13,203
- Yeah sure.

727
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:14,536
Anything's fine.

728
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,589
Thank you.

729
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,422
- Yeah.

730
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,223
Well, I hope you didn't
come here for nothing.

731
00:38:25,223 --> 00:38:26,806
- What do you mean?

732
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,498
- I'm probably gonna quit.

733
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:32,363
- Quit?

734
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:34,031
You're joking.

735
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:34,864
Why?

736
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:39,586
- See I never intended on taking
the job in the first place

737
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:42,312
but after I found that
I was working with you

738
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:47,312
well, I changed my mind and
now I don't know what to do.

739
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:49,014
- Wow.

740
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:52,573
I've heard some pretty
wild lines before Eric but.

741
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:55,344
So do you always interview for jobs

742
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:57,624
you have no intention of accepting?

743
00:38:57,624 --> 00:39:00,624
- No, it's a long, long, ugly story.

744
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:05,677
- Well, you'll have to
tell me about it sometime.

745
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,760
- Does that mean I can see you again?

746
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,530
- You did save my life.

747
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:16,922
- What, what the hell
was that about today?

748
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,074
- I have no idea.

749
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:22,657
That, nothing like that has
ever happened there before.

750
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:25,016
- I don't think Visions

751
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:28,183
is a good place for you to be working.

752
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:33,728
- That may be, but finding
another job is not that easy.

753
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:38,728
Besides the Growl Girl is a
huge deal for me, I need it.

754
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:42,020
- I don't need the work that badly.

755
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,853
- Eric.

756
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:47,608
Bottom line, we are in such
a tight deadline over there.

757
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:49,299
If we don't turn in a pitch tomorrow,

758
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,231
there's a good chance Visions
will lose this account

759
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:54,146
and that means I'm out of a job.

760
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:57,729
- Well, that might not
be such a bad thing.

761
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,948
- I know this sounds awfully selfish

762
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:04,484
but is there any way
you'd consider staying on?

763
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:08,035
Just to see this campaign through?

764
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:09,368
It might be fun.

765
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,433
What do you think, a couple days, a week?

766
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:15,933
How bad can it be?

767
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:31,291
(suspenseful music)

768
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:45,261
- Don't move.

769
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:47,625
(woman screaming)

770
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:48,561
Shut up!

771
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,409
Where is Montague?

772
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:51,996
Where is Montague.

773
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:53,351
- He's out of town.

774
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,532
- Do not lie to me.

775
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:56,975
Where is he?

776
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:59,276
- He's at the summer house.

777
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:00,109
- Liar!

778
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:04,996
- I called him myself, he
told me he'd bring the money.

779
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,372
- He has call forwarding.

780
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:07,257
- What?

781
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:11,293
- All his calls are forwarded
to the summer house.

782
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:12,258
- Call forwarding?

783
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:13,216
Wait.

784
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,538
No, don't bother, she's only
the maid, she's no challenge.

785
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:17,455
- Let's go.

786
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:26,130
- Yeah, great, that's terrific.

787
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,858
So before we move on I'd just like

788
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,028
you to fill out this little questionnaire.

789
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:34,471
You know, give us your number.

790
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:35,437
Bet I know what yours are.

791
00:41:35,437 --> 00:41:37,604
30, 20, 30 eh, am I right?

792
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,429
Just a little something

793
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:42,762
we like to do to get to know you better.

794
00:41:44,645 --> 00:41:46,215
- Dick.

795
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,068
- [Bunch] What?

796
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:51,585
- Frank from Avalon
Studios is on line three.

797
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:53,314
- Hello Frank, how are you?

798
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:56,046
- I'm fine Mr. Bunch, are you all right?

799
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,019
- Oh I'm fine.

800
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,918
- I heard about the shooting yesterday.

801
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:02,573
I just thought you oughta
know, a guy came around here

802
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:05,508
the other day, he said we was a detective.

803
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:07,981
He wanted to know about
a girl I used to date.

804
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:08,952
This was probably stupid,

805
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:13,776
but I later realized I may have
sent him in your direction.

806
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:14,945
- What do you mean?

807
00:42:14,945 --> 00:42:17,978
- He was looking for
your girl Caitland Ross.

808
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:19,434
I told him the last
time I actually saw her

809
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:20,914
was when I walked in on her.

810
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:24,711
She was all over one of
the guys from Visions.

811
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:27,711
We argued, I left, she was using me.

812
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,225
- What guy from Visions?

813
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:33,759
- What's the difference, it's
all water under the bridge.

814
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,592
Look, I just wanted you

815
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:36,827
to know in case the guy who was shooting

816
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:38,349
at you turns out to bet he same guy.

817
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,257
- This guy.

818
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,191
- [Frank] What guy?

819
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,079
- The detective.

820
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,458
What'd he look like?

821
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:48,458
- Oh, short dude, about 5'5
,a sort of dopey expression.

822
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:50,826
Kinda muscular, sound familiar?

823
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:54,909
- No, but thank you for
calling, I appreciate it.

824
00:42:56,715 --> 00:42:59,733
- Hey my pleasure, take care of yourself.

825
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:00,566
- Bye.

826
00:43:02,032 --> 00:43:03,032
So finished?

827
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,778
Right, well love I got your number

828
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:10,491
so I'll give you a call
when we've decided right?

829
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:12,869
Okay, find your own way out?

830
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:13,702
Good.

831
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:18,362
- Yes Dick?

832
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,418
- Send Manny in here right now.

833
00:43:21,418 --> 00:43:22,251
- Okay.

834
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:30,389
- Hello, and who might you be?

835
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:31,507
- Hi, I'm Eric Down.

836
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:32,768
I'm here for the Growl Jeans presentation.

837
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:34,211
- Ah, the new kid on the block.

838
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,028
Welcome, I'm Tom Rehnquist.

839
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,945
- Nice to meet you Tom.

840
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:38,778
- Morning guys.

841
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:39,986
- Hello Sam.

842
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:40,819
- Tom.

843
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:42,731
- You ready for this?

844
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:44,981
- As ready as I'll ever be.

845
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,464
- [Manny] Everybody's in
the conference room waiting.

846
00:43:49,464 --> 00:43:51,297
- [Bunch] Take a seat.

847
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,448
Caitland Ross.

848
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:57,394
Was you banging her?

849
00:43:57,394 --> 00:43:58,991
- Dick I don't know what Frank told you.

850
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:01,991
- Just give me an answer, yes or no.

851
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,433
- Yeah I did.

852
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:09,923
But let me explain to you what happened.

853
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:13,525
- What the hell do you
think you were doing?

854
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,587
You're going to jeopardize
our whole operation.

855
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:18,004
You worth this piece of shit.

856
00:44:19,028 --> 00:44:19,986
- It was before I knew that we were

857
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:24,022
going to use her Dick
and it just happened.

858
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:26,000
How was I supposed to know
that she was seeing Frank?

859
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,298
She never even mentioned his name.

860
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,181
- Why didn't you tell me before?

861
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:32,014
- I don't know.

862
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:35,288
Maybe because I knew you'd be pissed off

863
00:44:35,288 --> 00:44:37,385
and she stopped seeing Frank

864
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,680
and you kept pushing to
make the deal with her.

865
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,893
So I figured best thing
to do would be, forget it.

866
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:44,976
Do the deal.

867
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,749
- Man you really blew it.

868
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:51,715
- Why, what's going on?

869
00:44:51,715 --> 00:44:52,953
- Well you telling.

870
00:44:52,953 --> 00:44:56,147
Some gumshoe's sniffing
around the Avalon studios,

871
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:59,411
the lone ranger used me for
target practice in the hallway

872
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:02,972
and now you with more balls than brains.

873
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,979
God damn it Manny!

874
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:07,328
Next time you have an urge
to use the casting couch,

875
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,874
don't mess around with those girls.

876
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:10,707
Got it?

877
00:45:12,704 --> 00:45:13,954
Yeah, I got it.

878
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:16,909
- [Bunch] Let's go an see what

879
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:19,326
those guys have come up with.

880
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:28,168
- Very interesting huh little dude.

881
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,614
- Sorry for the delay folks.

882
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:34,355
- Hello everybody.

883
00:45:34,355 --> 00:45:36,078
All right Well I guess it's show time.

884
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:37,614
- All right that's enough.

885
00:45:37,614 --> 00:45:39,198
Let's get down to it shall we?

886
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,441
Tom, what you got?

887
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:43,793
- New 32nd spot for a diamond fair.

888
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:44,657
- Good.

889
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:47,407
(dramatic music)

890
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:50,521
- Look.

891
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:52,438
- Oh, that's so pretty.

892
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:58,084
(women gasps)

893
00:45:58,084 --> 00:45:59,470
- That is so big.

894
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,553
- Oh my gosh.

895
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:04,776
- You know if I had one that
big, I'd be showing it off to.

896
00:46:04,776 --> 00:46:06,228
- Look at the size of that.

897
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:08,711
- I've never seen one that big before.

898
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:10,932
- Whoa, that's yummy.

899
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:12,151
I know.

900
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:13,821
You think he'd let us try it on?

901
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:14,937
- Let's ask him.

902
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:16,270
Can I touch it.

903
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:18,782
- Oh yeah.

904
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:22,691
- [Man] In a women's
world where the only thing

905
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:26,858
that really counts as size,
remember The Jewelers.

906
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:32,147
- Oh yes, yes, yes.

907
00:46:32,147 --> 00:46:33,744
Very nice.

908
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:35,457
Very good, I like it.

909
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:36,790
Good, well done.

910
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:39,941
Eric, you're on.

911
00:46:49,026 --> 00:46:51,776
- Okay you have this
beautiful beautiful girl.

912
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:54,272
She's in a blouse, in Growl Jeans.

913
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:58,022
She's ascending the
stairs, smoke everywhere.

914
00:46:59,123 --> 00:47:01,523
At the top of the stairs her man awaits

915
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:04,023
and he's got want in his eyes.

916
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:07,885
As well as other places.

917
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:11,603
As she gets closer to
him she drops the blouse

918
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:13,678
and just as they're about to meet

919
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:17,159
a female announcer says
you'll be looking so good

920
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,599
in your Growl jeans, he'll
just wanna get you out of them.

921
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,545
Man puts his hands on her hips,

922
00:47:23,545 --> 00:47:24,791
she looks over her shoulder,

923
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,060
we get a close up of her face,

924
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,852
we hear pants unzipping, and the girl.

925
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:33,946
(Sam growls)

926
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:37,363
- We close on the logo and fade to black.

927
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:41,493
- Eric I'm sorry but I have to tell you,

928
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:44,160
but that is absolutely terrific.

929
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:47,864
(Bunch chuckles)

930
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,281
Yeah, Sam, great.

931
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,982
(group laughs)

932
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:53,454
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

933
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,794
I want you to make a video of
that right now in the studio.

934
00:47:56,794 --> 00:48:00,417
You make the arrangements
and when you put it together

935
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:04,388
don't forget to keep in the bottom line.

936
00:48:04,388 --> 00:48:06,308
- What's the bottom line?

937
00:48:06,308 --> 00:48:08,308
- The bottom line, yeah.

938
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,169
You don't know what I'm
talking about, do you?

939
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:15,895
Oh dear, oh dear, I need a holiday.

940
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:19,543
Tom, tell our boy what the bottom line is.

941
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:20,543
- Sex sells.

942
00:48:21,438 --> 00:48:23,855
- Sex sells Eric, sex sells.

943
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:28,617
And in one way or another,
everyone's buying it.

944
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,450
Thank God.

945
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:31,412
- By the way Dick.

946
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:32,331
I've got this killer idea

947
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:34,478
for the Thurman shocks
and stress campaign.

948
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,175
I'd like to use Kathy for it.

949
00:48:36,175 --> 00:48:39,592
- Well, Kathy is no longer with the firm.

950
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:43,695
- What, she was just here yesterday.

951
00:48:43,695 --> 00:48:46,491
- Yeah well yesterday she quit.

952
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,908
She's going off to Mary to get marryland.

953
00:48:51,146 --> 00:48:54,051
- Well, maybe if we offer some more money?

954
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:55,683
- She is no longer with us.

955
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,185
- Just find somebody else.

956
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,435
- End of story.

957
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,372
Yeah, so, well that wraps that up.

958
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:12,271
(suspenseful music)

959
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,119
- [Eric] Darrel!

960
00:49:26,102 --> 00:49:27,661
- Jesus Christ, what are you doing here?

961
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:28,765
- Can you bring up the phone numbers

962
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,698
from Dick's phone call to Abib?

963
00:49:30,698 --> 00:49:32,281
- Yeah, definitely.

964
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,869
I just overheard a conversation
between Dick and Manny.

965
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,789
Manny was the guy who was banging Caitland

966
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,641
when the engineer walked in on him,

967
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,475
we're on the right track.

968
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:42,771
- Listen, get the international operator

969
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,021
and find out what that country code is.

970
00:49:46,936 --> 00:49:48,238
Look in Dick's meeting

971
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:51,109
Dick said that Kathy got on
a plane to go to Maryland.

972
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:54,139
We both saw her get on a
plane and go to London.

973
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:58,806
- Yeah, can you give me the
country code for 964 please?

974
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:01,439
- You want to know why there wasn't

975
00:50:01,439 --> 00:50:03,913
any merchandise on Kathy at the airport?

976
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:07,321
Because Kathy was the merchandise.

977
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:08,291
- Wait, wait, wait,

978
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:11,361
what do you mean Kathy
was the merchandise?

979
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:12,528
Yeah, no shit.

980
00:50:13,835 --> 00:50:15,002
I mean thanks.

981
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:19,244
- It was, it was the
way Dick said sex sells

982
00:50:19,244 --> 00:50:20,700
and everyone's buying.

983
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,533
Scumbag.

984
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:23,891
I started thinking he's
got the perfect setup.

985
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:26,268
He interviews all these
beautiful girls for his ads

986
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:29,181
but they're also potential
goods for his other business.

987
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:32,664
Do they live alone, will they be missed?

988
00:50:32,664 --> 00:50:35,327
- You'll never guess
what I call just went to.

989
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,160
Iraq.

990
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:41,843
Oh my God and Caitland, Caitland Montagu.

991
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:44,093
- Sold off his merchandise.

992
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,172
- White slavery.

993
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:52,585
- Manny with one thing after another,

994
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:56,627
this week is really getting
off to a crappy start.

995
00:50:56,627 --> 00:50:57,460
- You know what?

996
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,293
I forgot my cigarettes.

997
00:50:58,293 --> 00:50:59,352
Wanna pull the car around?

998
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:00,414
I'll be right back.

999
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:01,486
- See what I mean?

1000
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:02,319
Crappy.

1001
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,491
Here mate, get us our car, would you?

1002
00:51:06,491 --> 00:51:07,324
Thank you.

1003
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:21,741
(car booms)

1004
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,035
Stone the bleeding crows.

1005
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:28,785
(dramatic music)

1006
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:38,488
- [Manny] You all right?

1007
00:51:38,488 --> 00:51:39,496
- Is anyone hurt?

1008
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,996
- Yeah, the valet.

1009
00:51:42,544 --> 00:51:44,467
(gun fires)

1010
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,550
(suspenseful music)

1011
00:51:59,054 --> 00:52:01,273
(gun fires)

1012
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:04,535
(cop cries out)

1013
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:06,170
- Call an ambulance!

1014
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,223
Help!

1015
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:08,280
It'll be all right okay?

1016
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,806
Don't move, don't move, all right?

1017
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:12,806
(suspenseful music)

1018
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:35,778
(gun fires)

1019
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:40,254
(engine rumbles)

1020
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:50,014
- Towns got it's weirdos huh?

1021
00:52:50,014 --> 00:52:52,764
(sirens wailing)

1022
00:52:56,754 --> 00:52:59,171
(com buzzes)

1023
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,677
- [Suzy] Dick, Frank from
Avalon Studios just called.

1024
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:05,510
He--

1025
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,981
- Don't want to talk to anyone right now,

1026
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:09,023
can't hear a damn thing.

1027
00:53:09,023 --> 00:53:11,339
Tell him I'll call him back.

1028
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:12,562
- He doesn't want to talk to you either,

1029
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:15,250
he just wanted me to tell
you to turn on channel seven.

1030
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:20,000
He said that you'd be very
interested in what's going on.

1031
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:24,718
- You'd better not be wasting my time.

1032
00:53:29,602 --> 00:53:30,755
- [Reporter] Caitland Montague who

1033
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:32,400
had moved out of the home of billionaire

1034
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,378
father Montgomery Montague lived

1035
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,223
alone under the name Caitland Ross.

1036
00:53:37,223 --> 00:53:38,506
But it was only last night we learned

1037
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,472
of Ms. Montague kidnapping when

1038
00:53:40,472 --> 00:53:42,174
her fathers chauffer Richard Gareth

1039
00:53:42,174 --> 00:53:45,259
was forced to the side of
the road and shot to death.

1040
00:53:45,259 --> 00:53:46,558
Apparently arrangements have

1041
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,774
been made for a ransom to be delivered.

1042
00:53:48,774 --> 00:53:50,188
And believing Montague was on his way

1043
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:55,049
from his mansion the kidnappers
tried to intercept him.

1044
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:55,882
- Great.

1045
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:00,326
- Okay mate, take five.

1046
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:05,059
Ms. Caitland Ross.

1047
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:09,555
I've heard some wonderful
things about you.

1048
00:54:09,555 --> 00:54:12,181
- Thank you Mr. Bunch.

1049
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:14,764
- Please, please, call me dick.

1050
00:54:16,177 --> 00:54:18,732
- I'm so happy to be
apart of Visions Dick.

1051
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:20,955
It's such an awesome opportunity.

1052
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:23,288
- So tell me about yourself.

1053
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,114
- Well I guess what I am

1054
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:31,031
is just a small town girl
with big city dreams.

1055
00:54:32,563 --> 00:54:33,854
- [Reporter] Discovering he was not

1056
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,078
in his car but in fact
coming from his boat house

1057
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:38,996
the kidnapper shot the
chauffer and then fled.

1058
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:42,068
- Bury this film real deep.

1059
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:46,684
Yeah, yeah, this ones for
export, she's gorgeous.

1060
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:49,158
Clients gonna love her.

1061
00:54:49,158 --> 00:54:52,472
Manny, I want her out of
here as soon as possible.

1062
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:53,995
- Okay.

1063
00:54:53,995 --> 00:54:55,758
- [Reporter] Montague's maid Lucy Popus

1064
00:54:55,758 --> 00:54:59,130
who narrowly escaped death
herself later called police.

1065
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,388
She explained the confusion

1066
00:55:00,388 --> 00:55:03,947
about Montague's where abouts
was due to call forwarding.

1067
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:06,065
- That's nice, yeah
that's real nice Darrel,

1068
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:07,395
you're inside watching television,

1069
00:55:07,395 --> 00:55:09,400
I'm outside getting my ass shot!

1070
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,233
Twice.

1071
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:13,641
One guys got a bullet in
him, another guys dead.

1072
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:15,637
I think it's time we get the cops in here.

1073
00:55:15,637 --> 00:55:17,598
- We don't wanna do that.

1074
00:55:17,598 --> 00:55:20,990
- What are we supposed
to do, fly all over Iraq?

1075
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:24,181
- Caitland Montague is
not in the Middle East.

1076
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:25,851
- New sources reveal that
Ms. Montague's captors

1077
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:29,271
are demanding 20 million
dollars for her release.

1078
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:30,963
Under her alis Caitland was trying

1079
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:33,709
to establish a career as a model.

1080
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:36,126
- Eric, she's been kidnapped.

1081
00:55:38,861 --> 00:55:39,975
- God.

1082
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:43,257
Darrel, what the hell is going on?

1083
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,157
Does Montague know about this?

1084
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:46,798
- Not until a few minutes ago.

1085
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:48,588
I mean he just called
and said they contacted

1086
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:50,313
him last night and he
didn't want anyone to know.

1087
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,463
He was just gonna pay them ransom

1088
00:55:51,463 --> 00:55:53,107
rather than risk her life

1089
00:55:53,107 --> 00:55:54,213
but things got all screwed up

1090
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:56,361
and now it's leaked out to the press.

1091
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:58,278
He's getting desperate.

1092
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,568
- Did he talk to the FBI?

1093
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,893
- Yeah but I told him they
would just screw everything up,

1094
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,543
they should leave him out of it.

1095
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:08,293
- Oh and this man listens to you?

1096
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:10,810
- Hey at least we have something to go on,

1097
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,387
okay we are closer than
anyone on this thing.

1098
00:56:13,387 --> 00:56:15,143
- [Reporter] About Caitland
Montague's whereabouts

1099
00:56:15,143 --> 00:56:17,735
please contact the Las
Vegas police department.

1100
00:56:17,735 --> 00:56:18,735
- You idiot.

1101
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,379
You were supposed to check her out.

1102
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,212
- Don't do that Dick.

1103
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:25,057
There's no way I could've
known who she was.

1104
00:56:25,057 --> 00:56:25,890
- If we could just--

1105
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:26,779
- Oh really?

1106
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:31,639
Well apparently Amir was
smart enough to figure it out.

1107
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,520
Look, just tell me
exactly what you told her

1108
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,236
before you put her on the plane.

1109
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:36,866
- Same exact thing I tell all of them

1110
00:56:36,866 --> 00:56:38,621
before I put them on the plane.

1111
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:40,067
I showed up at her door.

1112
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,626
I told her she had a job in London.

1113
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,750
She was peeing her pants
she was so excited.

1114
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:45,881
I took her to the airport,

1115
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:47,884
I put her on the plane and that was it.

1116
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,578
11 hours later I spoke to Amir,

1117
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:51,416
he said that she got there safely.

1118
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,916
- Jesus Christ, you are right.

1119
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:56,753
- Dude, I gotta get Sam out of there.

1120
00:56:56,753 --> 00:56:58,609
- Nope, Eric please.

1121
00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:00,137
She's the Growl Girl for Christ's sake.

1122
00:57:00,137 --> 00:57:02,298
Don't, you'll blow our
cover if you do that

1123
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:04,061
- So obviously she tells him who

1124
00:57:04,061 --> 00:57:07,415
she is figuring out that
would be her ticket on.

1125
00:57:07,415 --> 00:57:10,925
And then of course, Amir,
that double crossing

1126
00:57:10,925 --> 00:57:15,342
little midget, kidnaps her
and then tries to kill me.

1127
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:17,309
- That doesn't make any sense.

1128
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,098
Why would they try to kill you?

1129
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:20,813
- Because you don't kill

1130
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:23,537
the daughter of Montgomery Montague.

1131
00:57:23,537 --> 00:57:25,058
Bastards rich enough to hunt you down

1132
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,225
for the rest of your life.

1133
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:29,990
- I don't get it.

1134
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:34,421
- Do you know what's going
to happen when she gets home?

1135
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:36,450
She's going to tell the police how you

1136
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,705
and Visions tried to give

1137
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,705
her over to a bunch of ragged pimps.

1138
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:48,993
Oh you got it now have you?

1139
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,165
We know far too much.

1140
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:54,113
Yeah, I'm sure Amir
figured he had no choice

1141
00:57:54,113 --> 00:57:56,850
but to come on over here and kill us.

1142
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:57,767
- Kill you.

1143
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,187
- Oh, you was meant to
be in that car to Manny.

1144
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:06,656
(shoe thuds)

1145
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:15,496
- What's that?

1146
00:58:24,194 --> 00:58:29,194
All right, if they want to
play hard ball, so can we.

1147
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:32,034
(bug crunches)

1148
00:58:32,955 --> 00:58:34,372
- That's, dude that's the bug.

1149
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:36,723
Shit, come on, shit, they're less to bug.

1150
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:37,556
- Eric please.

1151
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:38,389
- They found the bug.

1152
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,174
- It's cool man, he
thinks Amir planted it.

1153
00:58:40,174 --> 00:58:42,984
- Eris please, just stay with
it okay, okay we lost the bug.

1154
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:45,826
But this scum bag is gonna
lead us right to Caitland.

1155
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:48,239
- I'm telling you right now,
it's time to bring the cops in.

1156
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:49,820
- Man, no we got these suckers caught,

1157
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,837
if anybody else comes in
they could fuck it all up.

1158
00:58:51,837 --> 00:58:53,565
- Mean while what if
something else goes wrong?

1159
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:56,845
- Eric, please I will get the
cops in soon enough, I swear.

1160
00:58:56,845 --> 00:59:00,678
But for now, let's just
find Caitland, please?

1161
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:03,962
- Call Abib.

1162
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:04,795
- Why?

1163
00:59:05,677 --> 00:59:08,677
- I want Amir's number in Las Vegas.

1164
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:12,757
I'm going to draft a letter explaining

1165
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:17,530
our entire operation,
including our ties to Amir.

1166
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,181
I'm going to put this in a sealed envelope

1167
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,118
which you will hand
deliver to my attorney.

1168
00:59:23,118 --> 00:59:25,318
I will then make it very clear to Amir

1169
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,055
how dangerous I am to him
dead which will make it--

1170
00:59:29,055 --> 00:59:30,305
- [Suzan] Dick?

1171
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:33,442
- Suzan you are interrupting.

1172
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:37,574
- Police are here and they
want to talk to you right away.

1173
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,324
- I will be out soon,

1174
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:42,043
as I was saying it will make him

1175
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:46,843
even more receptive to the
idea of a meeting with us.

1176
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:51,676
So, get ahold of Eric, I want
this whole thing played down.

1177
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:56,343
We give the cops a statement
and it's business as usual.

1178
00:59:58,313 --> 00:59:59,146
Got it?

1179
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:00,887
- Got it.

1180
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:04,125
- Good.

1181
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,875
(dramatic music)

1182
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,601
- All the arrangements have been made.

1183
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:17,812
These are the instructions
to the rendezvous point.

1184
01:00:17,812 --> 01:00:19,395
We're to meet them.

1185
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:24,314
(phone rings)

1186
01:00:26,343 --> 01:00:27,176
Hello?

1187
01:00:31,122 --> 01:00:32,372
It's Dick Bunch

1188
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:35,721
- Hello?

1189
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:36,554
- Hey, hey are you okay?

1190
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:37,927
You disappeared on me.

1191
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:39,435
- Hey man, yeah, I was giving

1192
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,430
a statement down at the police station.

1193
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,586
Dick was convincing bro.

1194
01:00:42,586 --> 01:00:43,498
He gave them this song

1195
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:44,698
and dance about how he didn't

1196
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:46,548
know anything, what was going on.

1197
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,180
Even I started to believe him.

1198
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,380
- What do you expect?

1199
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,911
- At this point anything goes, huh?

1200
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:53,358
- I'm glad you're all right.

1201
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,262
Listen, I'm calling to let you know

1202
01:00:54,262 --> 01:00:56,144
I'll be staking out Visions tonight.

1203
01:00:56,144 --> 01:00:58,392
If Dick's going to be making
a move, it's going to be soon.

1204
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:00,094
You want to join me?

1205
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:02,844
- I can't man, Sam's coming over.

1206
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,474
- All right well I'll call
you if anything goes down.

1207
01:01:06,474 --> 01:01:08,864
- Yeah listen, you do me a favor, okay?

1208
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:09,697
You be careful Darrel.

1209
01:01:09,697 --> 01:01:11,875
These guys, aren't
having a pissing contest.

1210
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,175
- Look, I will call you before
I do anything, all right?

1211
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:16,232
Hey, we're a team, right?

1212
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:18,279
- Absolutely man.

1213
01:01:18,279 --> 01:01:21,612
Okay, listen someone's here, I gotta go.

1214
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:24,592
Okay buddy, bye bye.

1215
01:01:32,115 --> 01:01:33,496
- Eric.

1216
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:34,852
Suzan told me what happened.

1217
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:38,141
Oh, I get so worried about you.

1218
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:38,974
You all right?

1219
01:01:38,974 --> 01:01:40,013
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1220
01:01:40,013 --> 01:01:43,831
Listen, I um, great gig or not I don't

1221
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:45,834
think that you should go back to Visions.

1222
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:47,466
I'm not.

1223
01:01:47,466 --> 01:01:50,049
I just care about you too much.

1224
01:01:50,981 --> 01:01:52,002
- Okay.

1225
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:52,835
- Okay.

1226
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,585
(dramatic music)

1227
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:04,889
(phone beeps)

1228
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:05,722
- Sorry.

1229
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,847
I gotta go, sorry.

1230
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:10,240
- What is it?

1231
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,667
- You know my mom, she's been really sick,

1232
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:14,584
I told to page me if she needed me.

1233
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,714
- Okay, well.

1234
01:02:17,957 --> 01:02:19,327
- Bad timing.

1235
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:21,136
- Tell her I hope she feels better.

1236
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:22,303
- I will.

1237
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:24,991
- I think I'm falling for her daughter.

1238
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,202
- I'll tell her.

1239
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:27,035
- Okay.

1240
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:27,868
- Bye.

1241
01:02:32,769 --> 01:02:35,769
(suspenseful music)

1242
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:54,608
- Come on.

1243
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:56,154
- [Bunch] Did you get that
letter to my attorney?

1244
01:02:56,154 --> 01:02:56,987
- [Manny] Yeah.

1245
01:02:56,987 --> 01:02:57,872
- [Bunch] Good.

1246
01:02:57,872 --> 01:02:59,072
- Now what?

1247
01:02:59,072 --> 01:03:03,152
- We go to the Palomino
club and we sit tight.

1248
01:03:03,152 --> 01:03:04,506
- [Manny] Why?

1249
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:05,817
- [Bunch] Cause they're gonna contact us

1250
01:03:05,817 --> 01:03:06,667
there to tell us where

1251
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:09,065
the actual meeting with
Amir is gonna take place.

1252
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:09,898
Okay?

1253
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:13,029
Well let's go.

1254
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:14,862
Don't look so nervous.

1255
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:18,587
(engine rumbles)

1256
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:26,092
(dramatic music)

1257
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:23,666
- Hello.

1258
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:25,710
- Eric, Darrel.

1259
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,406
Listen, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything but.

1260
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,487
- No, no, that's all
right, what's going on?

1261
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:31,654
You all right?

1262
01:04:32,711 --> 01:04:34,234
Darrel you all right?

1263
01:04:34,234 --> 01:04:38,901
- Yeah. Look I followed Dick,
over to the Palomino club.

1264
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:41,818
Do you remember that guy we saw outside

1265
01:04:41,818 --> 01:04:44,446
my window yesterday in the parking lot?

1266
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:45,370
- Yeah.

1267
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,854
- Yeah, well he's here to.

1268
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:49,640
- What's he doing?

1269
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,204
- So far he's just sitting at his car

1270
01:04:51,204 --> 01:04:54,085
but I'm sure that's just temporary.

1271
01:04:54,085 --> 01:04:55,498
It just seems every time this guy shows up

1272
01:04:55,498 --> 01:04:58,066
the shit hits the fan,
you know what I mean?

1273
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:00,852
- All right man listen, just sit tight,

1274
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:03,082
okay, I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes.

1275
01:05:03,082 --> 01:05:04,082
- Thank you.

1276
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,905
- Get a grip Manny,
everything's under control.

1277
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:16,007
Hello darling.

1278
01:05:16,007 --> 01:05:17,924
- So what do we do now?

1279
01:05:19,866 --> 01:05:20,699
- We wait.

1280
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:25,249
And we enjoy the entertainment.

1281
01:05:27,232 --> 01:05:28,073
Okay?

1282
01:05:28,073 --> 01:05:30,823
(dramatic music)

1283
01:05:42,632 --> 01:05:45,632
(suspenseful music)

1284
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,857
- Glad to see I did not underestimate

1285
01:06:27,857 --> 01:06:29,857
your ability to perform.

1286
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:33,596
- I followed your
instructions to the letter.

1287
01:06:33,596 --> 01:06:36,112
Now where's my daughter?

1288
01:06:36,112 --> 01:06:39,579
- And your daughter will be back soon.

1289
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,684
- That's not acceptable.

1290
01:06:41,684 --> 01:06:42,654
Where is she?

1291
01:06:42,654 --> 01:06:45,332
How do I know she's all right?

1292
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:48,918
If I'm not satisfied that she's all right

1293
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:51,501
you're going back empty handed.

1294
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:56,661
(suspenseful music)

1295
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,166
- Yes.

1296
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,691
He wishes to speak to her.

1297
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:08,691
(suspenseful music)

1298
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,357
- Caitland.

1299
01:07:14,357 --> 01:07:17,107
- Daddy, I wanna come home daddy.

1300
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,277
- You all right?

1301
01:07:20,277 --> 01:07:22,777
- Daddy please, I am so sorry.

1302
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,712
- Now just calm down, I'm here,

1303
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,211
I'm taking care of everything.

1304
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:32,489
- I'm sorry daddy.

1305
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:34,693
Just give them the money okay?

1306
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:37,193
I don't wanna die, I love you.

1307
01:07:38,081 --> 01:07:39,581
I really love you.

1308
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:45,126
- I'll get you home safe, I promise.

1309
01:08:00,398 --> 01:08:04,648
- Your daughter will be
home safely in a few hours.

1310
01:08:06,495 --> 01:08:07,867
- I'm gonna tell you something

1311
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:11,307
and I want you to listen very carefully.

1312
01:08:11,307 --> 01:08:15,041
If my daughter is hurt
or violated in any way,

1313
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,764
this money would mean a damn.

1314
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:20,847
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

1315
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:56,939
- What's going on?

1316
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:58,605
- Nothing yet.

1317
01:08:58,605 --> 01:09:01,188
Our friend is right over there.

1318
01:09:02,316 --> 01:09:04,808
He's been camping out
ever since he got here.

1319
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,456
I've been watching both doors though.

1320
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:09,289
Dick and company are still inside.

1321
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:13,644
- What if they went out the back?

1322
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:22,191

There they are.

1329
01:10:18,096 --> 01:10:20,423
- Looks like the others
haven't shown up yet.

1330
01:10:20,423 --> 01:10:23,590

1337

- Sam?

1338
01:11:10,819 --> 01:11:12,752
I guess your moms feeling better huh?

1339
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:14,493
- Look I can explain okay?

1340
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:16,221
This just isn't a good time.

1341
01:11:16,221 --> 01:11:17,054
- That's all right,

1342
01:11:17,054 --> 01:11:19,474
I don't think you need to
explain, I think I understand.

1343
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:21,307
- It's not the way it look okay?

1344
01:11:21,307 --> 01:11:22,843
Now please just get out of here.

1345
01:11:22,843 --> 01:11:26,299
- You heard the lady,
shove off, she's with me.

1346
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:27,826
- Hey look man, nobodies talking to you.

1347
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,685
So just keep drinking all right.

1348
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,786
- Eric.

1349
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,997
Go home, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1350
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:33,830
Okay?

1351
01:11:36,117 --> 01:11:38,661
- You're making a big mistake boy.

1352
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,328
- Eric, just calm down.

1353
01:11:40,328 --> 01:11:41,161
- Sam.

1354
01:11:41,161 --> 01:11:42,645
- You don't even know
what's going on here.

1355
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:43,478
- Eric.

1356
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:46,471
Son of a bitch.

1357
01:12:08,047 --> 01:12:12,214
- Your car is waiting for
you out front gentlemen.

1358
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,308
- Let's go.

1359
01:12:50,181 --> 01:12:52,354
- All right it's time to go
buddy, it's time to leave.

1360
01:12:52,354 --> 01:12:53,361
- Look this is my business all right?

1361
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:54,791
You guys just get lost.

1362
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:55,624
Sam.

1363
01:12:55,624 --> 01:12:58,791
- All right, you want to be tough guy?

1364
01:13:01,102 --> 01:13:01,935
- Oh my.

1365
01:13:03,026 --> 01:13:04,523
- Get off me man.

1366
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:09,190
(whacking)
(crying out)

1367
01:13:20,527 --> 01:13:23,277
(dramatic music)

1368
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:33,688
- Come on Sam.

1369
01:13:36,117 --> 01:13:37,117
Come on Sam.

1370
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,033
(engine rumbles)

1371
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:41,866
Come on.

1372
01:13:43,092 --> 01:13:44,092
Damn it Sam.

1373
01:13:46,056 --> 01:13:51,056
(dramatic music)
(whacking)

1374
01:14:00,347 --> 01:14:02,680
- You're a dead man now boy.

1375
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:09,933
(whacks)
(man cries out)

1376
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:14,792
- Ray!

1377
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:15,625
Damn it.

1378
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:19,538
- Sam!

1379
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:23,184
Wait!

1380
01:14:23,184 --> 01:14:25,378
- Believe me, I'll talk to
you later, I'm sorry Eric.

1381
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:26,722
I'm sorry!

1382
01:14:26,722 --> 01:14:28,972
- Are you involved in this?

1383
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:39,429
- Will you come on, they're getting away!

1384
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:43,346
Screw the hormones man,
goddamn it you asshole.

1385
01:14:46,406 --> 01:14:48,287
All right babe, go ahead,
follow that town car.

1386
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:49,295
- [Eric] You fucking nuts man?

1387
01:14:49,295 --> 01:14:50,128
Put that gun down.

1388
01:14:50,128 --> 01:14:50,961
- Not a chance okay?

1389
01:14:50,961 --> 01:14:51,794
I didn't wanna tell you this

1390
01:14:51,794 --> 01:14:53,285
but just before Dick;s car blew up

1391
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:54,634
I saw your little sweetie pie

1392
01:14:54,634 --> 01:14:56,651
here drive away with our mystery man.

1393
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:58,151
- He's my partner.

1394
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:02,624
Look Eric, I haven't been totally
honest with you all right.

1395
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:03,457
What happened between us,

1396
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:06,303
that was real okay but I'm not a model.

1397
01:15:06,303 --> 01:15:07,886
I work for the FBI.

1398
01:15:09,578 --> 01:15:10,411
- The FBI?

1399
01:15:10,411 --> 01:15:12,093
- Yes, it's true I've been assigned

1400
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:14,422
to find Caitland Montague
and the kidnappers.

1401
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:15,832
- How would you know about the kidnapping?

1402
01:15:15,832 --> 01:15:18,087
Monty just released the information today.

1403
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:20,665
- What are you talking about?

1404
01:15:20,665 --> 01:15:22,275
- Darrel here is a private investigator,

1405
01:15:22,275 --> 01:15:25,274
Darrel, tell her who
you're working for man.

1406
01:15:25,274 --> 01:15:26,560
- If you're following the kidnappers

1407
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,538
why are you chasing Bunch?

1408
01:15:28,538 --> 01:15:30,656
- Cause the two are tied together.

1409
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:32,452
We've had Visions staked
out for a long time now,

1410
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:34,854
we know Dick Bunch runs a
white slavery operation.

1411
01:15:34,854 --> 01:15:36,428
In fact we finally got the hard evidence

1412
01:15:36,428 --> 01:15:38,648
we needed at the airport yesterday.

1413
01:15:38,648 --> 01:15:39,764
We had agents on one of the planes

1414
01:15:39,764 --> 01:15:41,696
to intercept the model Kathy Juno.

1415
01:15:41,696 --> 01:15:43,315
Some bozo must have screwed
up the whole operation

1416
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:44,972
by calling the local police.

1417
01:15:44,972 --> 01:15:46,244
- Yeah it's amazing how one jerk off

1418
01:15:46,244 --> 01:15:48,068
can spoil everything, isn't it?

1419
01:15:48,068 --> 01:15:49,268
- Yeah.

1420
01:15:49,268 --> 01:15:50,865
Anyway Montague contacted us a week ago

1421
01:15:50,865 --> 01:15:52,447
and gave us pictures of his daughter.

1422
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,198
We saw them as shots of a
Visions model, Caitland Ross.

1423
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:56,865
That's when I went in as a model.

1424
01:15:56,865 --> 01:15:59,506
We knew eventually Dick
would lead us to Caitland.

1425
01:15:59,506 --> 01:16:01,471
You know I talked to Montague my self,

1426
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:04,336
he never mentioned anything
about hiring a detective.

1427
01:16:04,336 --> 01:16:07,963
- He didn't actually personally hire me.

1428
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:11,216
- Wait, wait, wait a second,
what are you talking about?

1429
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:13,662
- Well you know I was
independently working for him.

1430
01:16:13,662 --> 01:16:16,363
- Wait a minute, what do
you mean independently?

1431
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,624
- I was trying to get the reward.

1432
01:16:17,624 --> 01:16:18,894
- The what?

1433
01:16:18,894 --> 01:16:20,869
- The reward, the reward okay, the reward.

1434
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:22,023
- There's a reward?

1435
01:16:22,023 --> 01:16:23,233
- Yes.

1436
01:16:23,233 --> 01:16:24,212
The Montague's may not have been

1437
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,731
all that cozy to each other

1438
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:29,128
but old Monty still put up
a million bucks to find her.

1439
01:16:29,128 --> 01:16:30,399
- A million dollars?

1440
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:31,357
A million dollars?

1441
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:32,979
Darrel you told me 150 bucks,

1442
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:36,627
you told me you were
gonna pay me 150 bucks.

1443
01:16:36,627 --> 01:16:38,794
- Damn it, where are they?

1444
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:41,540
Damn it.

1445
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,540
(suspenseful music)

1446
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:54,524
- Bro I was gonna split it with you 50 50

1447
01:16:54,524 --> 01:16:55,362
I just didn't want to say anything

1448
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:58,015
in case we didn't find her.

1449
01:16:58,015 --> 01:16:58,848
I swear.

1450
01:17:00,606 --> 01:17:01,606
Bro it's me.

1451
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:07,038
(suspenseful music)

1452
01:17:15,435 --> 01:17:16,832
- What the hell are these guys doing here?

1453
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,748
- It's a long story Ray.

1454
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:20,498
So what's the status?

1455
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:23,944
- They just entered that warehouse.

1456
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:26,944
(suspenseful music)

1457
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:39,228
- The backups are on the way.

1458
01:17:39,228 --> 01:17:41,054
You guys stay here.

1459
01:17:41,054 --> 01:17:43,484
In the meantime I'm going
to check things out.

1460
01:17:43,484 --> 01:17:44,401
Don't move.

1461
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:46,984
- [Sam] Okay.

1462
01:17:52,743 --> 01:17:55,410
(hatch rattles)

1463
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,119
(suspenseful music)

1464
01:18:24,636 --> 01:18:25,469
- Open it.

1465
01:18:26,417 --> 01:18:27,575
(case clicks)

1466
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:30,575
(suspenseful music)

1467
01:18:36,228 --> 01:18:37,228
- Mr. Charm.

1468
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,113
(suspenseful music)

1469
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,597
- Follow me.

1470
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:48,597
(suspenseful music)

1471
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,355
- Stay here guys.

1472
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:54,355
(suspenseful music)

1473
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,800
- Amir old son.

1474
01:19:33,657 --> 01:19:36,140
Now we had a great relationship,

1475
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:41,049
I'm very disappointing you
decided to screw it up.

1476
01:19:41,049 --> 01:19:43,127
- 20 million dollars is good enough

1477
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:45,794
reason to screw up relationship.

1478
01:19:46,727 --> 01:19:48,272
- Montague's a very powerful man,

1479
01:19:48,272 --> 01:19:51,729
messing around with him
could get you killed.

1480
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:54,977
- His daughter will be returned unharmed.

1481
01:19:54,977 --> 01:19:56,870
- And talking of killing,

1482
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:59,152
you tried to do me in, didn't you?

1483
01:19:59,152 --> 01:20:01,824
To cover your tracks eh?

1484
01:20:01,824 --> 01:20:05,609
- That was poor judgment on my part.

1485
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:06,442
Look.

1486
01:20:07,713 --> 01:20:10,187
20 million dollars is good enough reason

1487
01:20:10,187 --> 01:20:13,604
for us to all disappear, very, very rich.

1488
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:16,513
- [Bunch] Well personally speaking

1489
01:20:16,513 --> 01:20:18,863
I don't want to disappear.

1490
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:21,796
I'd sooner that the old
girl shag every agency

1491
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:23,747
in the world looking for us.

1492
01:20:23,747 --> 01:20:28,729
- Well you're not calling
the shots here Mr. Bunch.

1493
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:30,768
Let's just reason this out.

1494
01:20:30,768 --> 01:20:35,566
That letter to your attorney
would grieve us greatly,

1495
01:20:35,566 --> 01:20:37,899
as would your sudden demise.

1496
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:42,578
I'm sure we can come to terms.

1497
01:20:42,578 --> 01:20:44,569
- Don't count on it.

1498
01:20:44,569 --> 01:20:47,558
All right now, I'll be the
once calling the shots.

1499
01:20:47,558 --> 01:20:48,391
You move.

1500
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,805
Come on Manny, let's get the girl.

1501
01:20:58,416 --> 01:20:59,781
Here, she's in here.

1502
01:20:59,781 --> 01:21:02,889
(suspenseful music)

1503
01:21:02,889 --> 01:21:04,425
- Okay, the girl dies.

1504
01:21:04,425 --> 01:21:05,650
- Yeah?

1505
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:07,628
She'll have company.

1506
01:21:07,628 --> 01:21:09,980
- This is going to be hard enough.

1507
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:12,063
We need to work together.

1508
01:21:12,996 --> 01:21:14,209
- Don't bet on it.

1509
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:15,625
Manny, get the girl.

1510
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,551
- Dick he's right, we
need to think about this.

1511
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:22,551
- I'll do the thinking you
dumb shit, just get the bitch.

1512
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:23,813
Go on.

1513
01:21:28,668 --> 01:21:31,423
Don't even think about that.

1514
01:21:31,423 --> 01:21:35,306
- Mr. Bunch what do you
get out of killing us?

1515
01:21:35,306 --> 01:21:37,473
- I'll sleep a lot better.

1516
01:21:38,749 --> 01:21:42,916
(Manny whacks)
(Dick cries out)

1517
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:46,166
- [Amir] No don't kill him, the letter.

1518
01:21:47,425 --> 01:21:49,815
- Oh that's right, the letter,

1519
01:21:49,815 --> 01:21:52,463
the letter to the attorney, right.

1520
01:21:52,463 --> 01:21:53,463
This letter.

1521
01:21:55,466 --> 01:21:57,502
- What the hells going on?

1522
01:21:57,502 --> 01:22:00,409
- [Amir] You should treat
your people better Mr. Bunch.

1523
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:01,746
When Manny found out the girl

1524
01:22:01,746 --> 01:22:06,236
was Caitland Montague
he came to us, not you.

1525
01:22:06,236 --> 01:22:09,193
- Manny I treated you good.

1526
01:22:09,193 --> 01:22:11,519
- You treated me like shit Dick.

1527
01:22:11,519 --> 01:22:14,124
- Listen we've been
through a lot together,

1528
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:17,041
now don't team up with them jokers.

1529
01:22:17,964 --> 01:22:19,452
You're much better than that.

1530
01:22:19,452 --> 01:22:21,697
- Oh I'm not teaming up with them Dick.

1531
01:22:21,697 --> 01:22:23,683
(gun fires)

1532
01:22:23,683 --> 01:22:25,219
- Oh!

1533
01:22:25,219 --> 01:22:27,068
- But I'm not teaming up with you either.

1534
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:29,263
You really think I'm stupid don't you?

1535
01:22:29,263 --> 01:22:31,495
She never made it to the plane Dick.

1536
01:22:31,495 --> 01:22:32,707
And you'd be surprised how easy

1537
01:22:32,707 --> 01:22:33,753
it was to get these idiots

1538
01:22:33,753 --> 01:22:37,257
to extort millions of
dollars from her old man.

1539
01:22:37,257 --> 01:22:39,691
- Okay, than you got your money eh?

1540
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:41,959
Well there's no need to kill me to.

1541
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:43,953
- Oh no see Caitland Ross
left a gleaming trail

1542
01:22:43,953 --> 01:22:45,502
right to your front door step Dick.

1543
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,709
It's gotta end there, I'm sorry.

1544
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:48,956
There's nothing I can do about that.

1545
01:22:48,956 --> 01:22:50,583
They're just gonna have
to find what's left of all

1546
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:54,177
of you in the charred remains
of this unsafe old warehouse.

1547
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:56,145
- But they'll know that you've run

1548
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:58,461
off with the money,
they'll be looking for ya.

1549
01:22:58,461 --> 01:22:59,479
- Oh no, you see I'll just scatter

1550
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:01,617
a couple piles of money around.

1551
01:23:01,617 --> 01:23:05,479
It'll be worth loosing a couple
of million, don't you think?

1552
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:09,908
To make sure that Montague and
the cops sop looking for me.

1553
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:11,193
That's it you see?

1554
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:12,537
They'll have the kidnappers.

1555
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:14,073
They'll think the money burned in the fire

1556
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:18,011
and sweet little Caitland will
be at home, safe and sound.

1557
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:22,928
- Excuse me Manny, you are not
thinking this thing through.

1558
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,482
- She can still identify you.

1559
01:23:28,513 --> 01:23:29,346
(gun fires)

1560
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:30,179
(Dick cries out)

1561
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:33,179
- I am not the idiot you think I am.

1562
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:41,640
(dick crying out)

1563
01:23:58,057 --> 01:23:59,094
- Guys come on.

1564
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:00,689
- Can't believe this guy.

1565
01:24:00,689 --> 01:24:02,224
- [Darrel] Come on, come on.

1566
01:24:02,224 --> 01:24:05,224
(suspenseful music)

1567
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,047
(gun firing)

1568
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:14,048
(suspenseful music)

1569
01:24:31,824 --> 01:24:33,906
- We can't go back out
the same way we came in.

1570
01:24:33,906 --> 01:24:35,489
- So what do we do?

1571
01:24:36,582 --> 01:24:38,249
- I'll check it out.

1572
01:24:39,414 --> 01:24:41,827
- Ms. Montague, I'm Darrel Chism.

1573
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:45,043
I'm the guy who's rescuing
you, Darrel Chism, C-H-I--

1574
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:45,881
- Will you shut up?

1575
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:47,284
You're scaring her.

1576
01:24:47,284 --> 01:24:50,284
(suspenseful music)

1577
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:01,820
(gun fires)

1578
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:04,424
(Ray cries out)

1579
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:06,174
- You guys stay here.

1580
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,117
- Hey, watch her.

1581
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:13,238
(suspenseful music)

1582
01:25:15,201 --> 01:25:17,601
- Shit, Eric doesn't have a gun.

1583
01:25:17,601 --> 01:25:19,425
- Who are you guys.

1584
01:25:19,425 --> 01:25:24,425
- Just stay here, don't move
a muscle okay, don't move.

1585
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:25,524
Chism.

1586
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:28,524
(suspenseful music)

1587
01:25:44,163 --> 01:25:45,734
(gun fires)

1588
01:25:45,734 --> 01:25:48,734
(suspenseful music)

1589
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:11,540
(gun firing)

1590
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:16,598
- Oh God.

1591
01:26:16,598 --> 01:26:17,431
Come on.

1592
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:23,223
(dramatic music)

1593
01:26:27,661 --> 01:26:28,835
(whacks)

1594
01:26:28,835 --> 01:26:30,681
(suspenseful music)

1595
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:35,348
(whacking)
(crying out)

1596
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,133
- Hold it!

1597
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:44,448
- It's over Manny.

1598
01:26:44,448 --> 01:26:45,281
- FBI.

1599
01:26:46,931 --> 01:26:47,848
- Caitland.

1600
01:26:49,773 --> 01:26:51,606
Caitland, don't do it.

1601
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:55,993
He's not worth the Caitland.

1602
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:57,826
- Everybody drop them.

1603
01:26:59,193 --> 01:27:00,816
- No, you don't understand.

1604
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:04,329
- Yes I do understand,
every body drop them.

1605
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:05,193
- Thanks for showing up.

1606
01:27:05,193 --> 01:27:06,702
Give me that, get over there.

1607
01:27:06,702 --> 01:27:08,384
Move, put it down!

1608
01:27:08,384 --> 01:27:10,041
Get over there.

1609
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:10,874
You.

1610
01:27:10,874 --> 01:27:12,080
(whacks)
(cries out)

1611
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,677
Get over there by your friends.

1612
01:27:13,677 --> 01:27:14,510
Get down.

1613
01:27:15,464 --> 01:27:16,297
(whacks)
(cries out)

1614
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:18,130
I said get down, move.

1615
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:21,776
- What do we do with him?

1616
01:27:21,776 --> 01:27:22,859
- Tie him up.

1617
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:30,129
- Caitland, he's scum,
you don't want to do this.

1618
01:27:30,129 --> 01:27:31,102
- [Manny] Shut up.

1619
01:27:31,102 --> 01:27:33,813
- Manny is the best thing
that ever happened in my life.

1620
01:27:33,813 --> 01:27:35,862
- Sure, it takes some one real special

1621
01:27:35,862 --> 01:27:38,385
to help you screw over your own father.

1622
01:27:38,385 --> 01:27:41,132
- I'm not screwing him, he screwed me.

1623
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:41,965
- [Manny] Shut up.

1624
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:42,990
- My father never gave a shit about me.

1625
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:45,009
So when he couldn't
control me, he cut me off.

1626
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:46,785
That 20 million dollars is mine!

1627
01:27:46,785 --> 01:27:47,756
- Shut up!

1628
01:27:47,756 --> 01:27:50,756
(suspenseful music)

1629
01:27:54,052 --> 01:27:55,624
Babe you know what to do right?

1630
01:27:55,624 --> 01:27:57,667
You go down the road, you call the police,

1631
01:27:57,667 --> 01:28:02,334
and you tell them you just
barely go tout of here, Cait.

1632
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,270
You with me?

1633
01:28:06,736 --> 01:28:08,903
- Yeah Manny, I'm with ya.

1634
01:28:10,656 --> 01:28:13,309
- You're sick, pathetic.

1635
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:14,735
- Shut up!

1636
01:28:14,735 --> 01:28:17,735
(suspenseful music)

1637
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:24,270
- Oh shit, hurry up, tie him up, hurry up,

1638
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,353
we gotta get out of here!

1639
01:28:27,217 --> 01:28:30,217
(suspenseful music)

1640
01:28:35,792 --> 01:28:38,625
- Now Manny that is really stupid.

1641
01:28:41,547 --> 01:28:46,547
Drop those guns or I'll drop
this and blow us all away.

1642
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:49,867
(suspenseful music)

1643
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,621
Now I want you to, I want you to--

1644
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:57,621
(suspenseful music)

1645
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:06,041
- Got it!

1646
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:09,041
(suspenseful music)

1647
01:29:12,162 --> 01:29:13,074
(gun fires)

1648
01:29:13,074 --> 01:29:14,622
- [Caitland] Manny!

1649
01:29:14,622 --> 01:29:15,455
No, no!

1650
01:29:17,176 --> 01:29:20,176
(suspenseful music)

1651
01:29:22,536 --> 01:29:24,767
- Come on, let's go!

1652
01:29:24,767 --> 01:29:29,767
(Caitland crying)
(suspenseful music)

1653
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:37,253
- Now, come on!

1654
01:29:38,241 --> 01:29:39,074
Come on!

1655
01:29:44,402 --> 01:29:47,235
(warehouse booms)

1656
01:29:57,837 --> 01:29:59,424
- Holy smokes.

1657
01:29:59,424 --> 01:30:02,424
(warehouse booming)

1658
01:30:07,888 --> 01:30:08,721
- Woo wee.

1659
01:30:10,922 --> 01:30:11,755
- Whoa.

1660
01:30:13,516 --> 01:30:15,823
- You have the right to remain silent,

1661
01:30:15,823 --> 01:30:17,670
you give up the right to
remain silent anything--

1662
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,016
- Anything I say can

1663
01:30:19,016 --> 01:30:20,645
and will be used against me in

1664
01:30:20,645 --> 01:30:22,399
a court of law, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1665
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:23,830
Been there, done that.

1666
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:24,975
- Well let's do it again.

1667
01:30:24,975 --> 01:30:26,892
- Hey, hey, easy, easy.

1668
01:30:30,738 --> 01:30:31,794
- What, what?

1669
01:30:31,794 --> 01:30:32,677
- Easy man, easy.

1670
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:33,594
- Hey, hey.

1671
01:30:35,753 --> 01:30:38,566
Don't think I'm forgetting
about my reward!

1672
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:41,698
We got the money, we
go this daughter back.

1673
01:30:41,698 --> 01:30:45,198
It's not my fault she's a conniving bitch!

1674
01:30:52,085 --> 01:30:54,835
(dramatic music)

1675
01:31:05,538 --> 01:31:06,371

- Yeah, thanks to the reward money.

1679
01:31:14,316 --> 01:31:17,165
- Darrel, I had no idea you
knew a thing about advertising.

1680
01:31:17,165 --> 01:31:18,692
- Well I don't but what did

1681
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:20,827
I know about being a detective, right?

1682
01:31:20,827 --> 01:31:22,945
- Oh thank God those days are over.

1683
01:31:22,945 --> 01:31:23,778
- Amen.

1684
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,515
- Yeah, actually Darrel's doing great.

1685
01:31:25,515 --> 01:31:27,147
Just got us the Muan Hotel account.

1686
01:31:27,147 --> 01:31:28,333

1687
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:29,234

Which reminds me.

1689
01:31:30,519 --> 01:31:33,144
You two crazy kids better
hurry up and get going.

1690
01:31:33,144 --> 01:31:35,702
You have an appointment with them at two.

1691
01:31:35,702 --> 01:31:37,106
- Okay, we'll see you buddy.

1692
01:31:37,106 --> 01:31:38,189
- Bye Darrel.

1693
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:46,695
So what do you want for lunch?

1694
01:31:46,695 --> 01:31:48,540
- I don't know, where should we go?

1695
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:52,707
- How about my place, we
could start with dessert.

1696
01:32:12,663 --> 01:32:14,667
