3
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:49,320
So, February 1, 2005.

4
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,608
0800 hours.

5
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,711
This begins the inquiry

6
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,379
into the mission herein
referred to

7
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,948
as "Operation
Provide Support."

8
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,851
Commander Axe, do you have
anything to say before we begin?

9
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,186
Uh, well, sir,
it's actually

10
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,721
more of a question
than a statement.

11
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,055
Can I have a beer?

12
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,359
You may not have a beer.

13
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,928
But you may stand up
and raise your right hand.

14
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,432
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

15
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,368
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

16
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:17,736
Yeah.

17
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,237
Uh, sir,
am I on trial here?

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,106
'Cause I got the word about
wearing the dress whites,

19
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,774
and now we're doing
the whole oath thing.

20
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,976
For now, this is not
an official legal proceeding.

21
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,712
Think of it
as an informal conversation

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,682
to sort out exactly
what happened here.

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,317
We've got
over a dozen casualties,

24
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:36,021
some structures destroyed,
a few vehicles destroyed.

25
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:40,025
This little disaster is gonna
take some serious sorting out.

26
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:40,992
I mean, that's why
I suggested the beer.

27
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,929
I'll ask you not to waste
my time, Commander Axe.

28
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,032
Now, can we begin?
You're the boss, sir.

29
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,667
Let's start with how
you first became involved

30
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,069
in this operation.

31
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,506
Ah.
Uh, that kind of depends.

32
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,775
There's kind of
the "official" beginning,

33
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,576
and then the "unofficial"
beginning.

34
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,345
You know what I mean?

35
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,882
Right, well, uh, okay.

36
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,551
This whole thing began...

37
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,719
in bed.

38
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,387
<i>A couple weeks back,</i>

39
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,556
<i>I had just started seeing</i>
<i>a lady by the name of Donna.</i>

40
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,091
<i>Great gal.</i>

41
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,993
<i>Thing is, we were still</i>
<i>getting to know each other,</i>

42
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,494
<i>and it turned out, uh...</i>

43
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:17,629
<i>I didn't know her</i>
<i>as well as I thought.</i>

44
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,397
Pretty good.

45
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,499
You should come by and teach
the teams a few moves.

46
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,235
You should teach my husband
a few moves.

47
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,172
Wait a second. Your husband?
You're married?

48
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,407
Oh, don't be that way.
It's fine.

49
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,209
Uh, well, no,
actually, uh...

50
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,377
It's not fine.

51
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,545
I kind of have a thing
about that.

52
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,113
He barely looks at me now.

53
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,649
It's like he's not even
my husband anymore. He's just --

54
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:40,552
oh, my God. He's here.

55
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:42,454
What?!

56
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,289
I don't understand!
He should still be in D.C.!

57
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:46,791
That's your husband?

58
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,626
You're married
to Admiral Maitland?

59
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:51,062
Just -- just go, okay?

60
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,997
No, no, not that way!
He'll see you!

61
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,466
No! The bathroom!

62
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:03,508
Well, it's been great.

63
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,177
<i>Now, as a S.E.A.L.,</i>

64
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,913
<i>I've been involved in evasive</i>
<i>maneuvers, but this...</i>

65
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,517
<i>...Was an unusual</i>
<i>tactical situation.</i>

66
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,419
Hey, Donna?!

67
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,788
What's the matter with Buster?
He's going crazy out here.

68
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,356
I don't know.

69
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,259
<i>Still, same principles apply</i>
<i>in any hostile encounter</i>

70
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,461
<i>when you need to get out clean</i>
<i>without engaging the enemy --</i>

71
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,763
<i>identify an escape route...</i>

72
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,966
Ooh!
<i>...And blend seamlessly</i>
<i>into the surroundings.</i>

73
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:31,169
Wait, wait --
how exactly does this relate

74
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,637
to the mission
in question?

75
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,838
Uh,
I'm getting there, sir.

76
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,340
This -- this is important,
I promise.

77
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,208
I just don't want to hear any
more of your romantic escapades.

78
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,610
Is there a point?

79
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,011
Okay, so, that night...
<i>...I headed out.</i>

80
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,713
<i>Now, with this type of problem,</i>

81
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,383
<i>some men will duck and cover,</i>
<i>others will turn to booze.</i>

82
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,454
<i>Me? Let's just say I have</i>
<i>my own secret weapon.</i>

83
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,723
I swear, every time I see you,
you look different.

84
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,959
Comes with the job, Sam.

85
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:57,262
Hey, nice tan, Mikey.
Where you been?

86
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,897
Someplace sunny.

87
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,798
Well, it agrees with you --
I remember how pasty you got

88
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,201
when we were stuck
back in Poland in '92.

89
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,302
Hey, how long you in town?

90
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,737
A few days of debriefing
at least.

91
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,372
We'll see.

92
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,074
So, not to impose, but you feel
like advising an old buddy

93
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,209
with a sticky situation?

94
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,712
How sticky?

95
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,848
Sticky like, let's get a table
and a few more rounds.

96
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,350
Sam.

97
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,954
An admiral?

98
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,390
It had to be
an admiral's wife?

99
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:26,758
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,493
So, look, what do you think
I should do here?

101
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,028
Go to Maitland
and explain.

102
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,529
Tell him you didn't know
who she was

103
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,898
until things had already
gotten out of hand.

104
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,333
In fact,
call him right now.

105
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,735
Mike,
that's not what I --

106
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,804
look, I was more looking
for that super-spy advice

107
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,906
on how to keep this quiet.

108
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,274
You remember that thing in Kiev
with Misha?

109
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,510
When he sold out the wetwork
team on their way to Paris?

110
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,778
Hell, yeah.
What about that?

111
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:49,013
That's the kind of secret
that stays secret.

112
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,816
Because if it comes out,
people get sent to Siberia.

113
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,518
This will come out
as soon as Maitland

114
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,086
looks sideways
at his wife.

115
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,155
Seriously, Mike, you know,
I know you're a smart guy,

116
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,590
but you've dated,
like, one lady,

117
00:05:58,657 --> 00:05:59,791
and she was
a frickin' psycho.

118
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,492
I'm just saying...

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,596
You may not be the expert
on this whole boy-girl thing.

120
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,698
My job is to know what people
are gonna do before they do it.

121
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:09,133
Which is how I know you're
not gonna take my advice

122
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,802
and this is gonna blow up
in your face, Sam.

123
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,270
I don't know.

124
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,239
I mean, how smart
can spies be, right?

125
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:16,441
You're always fighting
on the side with no guns.

126
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:17,675
There are certain rewards

127
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,344
to fighting on the side
with no guns.

128
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,981
Tell you what, one day,

129
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:25,116
you're gonna give me
some spy lessons, deal?

130
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,252
Deal.

131
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,988
Mm. I got to go.

132
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,823
You gonna be all right?

133
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,957
Yeah, I'll be fine.

134
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,292
Thanks for the beer.

135
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,627
Oh, and, Sam...

136
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:37,862
...Be careful.

137
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,871
<i>So, I have a few more drinks</i>
<i>and head home,</i>

138
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,539
<i>figuring that maybe it's best</i>

139
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,074
<i>not to get relationship advice</i>
<i>from a spy.</i>

140
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,012
<i>Thing is,</i>
<i>turned out the spy was right.</i>

141
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,714
Commander Axe?
You need to come with us.

142
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,550
Says who?!

143
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,586
You were in my house...

144
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,621
In bed with my wife!

145
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,857
And don't even try to deny it,
'cause I found your belt.

146
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,225
Does that look familiar?

147
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,227
I talked to Donna,
and she told me everything.

148
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,229
Admiral,
I was unaware, sir,

149
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,163
that she was your
significant other.

150
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,998
You were unaware?

151
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,967
You're a Navy S.E.A.L.!

152
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,302
You're trained
in battlefield awareness,

153
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,004
and you didn't see my name
on the mailbox?!

154
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,173
Well, sir, I wasn't exactly
in that frame of mind, sir.

155
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,208
A-as you can imagine,
I was otherwise occupied, sir.

156
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,978
I'll stop talking now,
sir.

157
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,182
So, I checked my docket
for an assignment

158
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,417
that would get you
out of my sight

159
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,851
for the foreseeable future.

160
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,520
And I think I found
just the thing.

161
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:39,490
Oh, not Siberia.
<i>Please</i> not Siberia.

162
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,460
You're going to Colombia.
Tonight.

163
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,795
Oh, sir,
with all due respect,

164
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,596
I'd need to pack, sir,
and, well, uh --

165
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:46,998
Are you refusing orders?
No, sir. No, sir.

166
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,366
Of course not.
It's just that I --

167
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,701
well,
it's been a while, sir.

168
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,669
And, of course,
for a mission in South America,

169
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,471
I should really brush up
on my Spanish.

170
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,574
Well, you got a 12-hour
plane ride, so...

171
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,844
...Brush up, amigo.

172
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,879
"Amigo."
That's "friend," right, sir?

173
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,281
Get the hell
out of my office!

174
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,826
<i>So, like a good soldier,</i>

175
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,694
<i>the next morning</i>
<i>I was up bright and early</i>

176
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,098
<i>enjoying a first-class</i>
<i>plane ride down to Colombia.</i>

177
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:28,106
Hey!

178
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:32,110
What the hell
are you wearing, brother?

179
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,845
I got issued these.

180
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:36,180
You do know most of Colombia
is green, right?

181
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:37,582
Yeah, I don't think
the guy who issued them

182
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:38,850
wanted me to blend in.

183
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,218
Can you turn that crap off?

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,154
You know, I was
supposed to be takin'

185
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,423
some Green Beret named Donohue
down on this mission.

186
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,059
Heard he got drunk
and set a tank on fire.

187
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,794
Guess you screwed up
even worse, huh?

188
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,562
Yeah, it would seem so.

189
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,764
What did you do?

190
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,365
Must have been
something crazy, man!

191
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,167
Look, I don't
want to get into it, okay?

192
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,402
Suit yourself.

193
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,370
Good luck, big guy!

194
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,438
Yeah, thanks.

195
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,644
<i>I read over the mission.</i>

196
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,079
<i>Essentially I was going down</i>

197
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,281
<i>to check on reports</i>
<i>of unrest in the region.</i>

198
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,150
<i>Basically,</i>
<i>a local Colombian official</i>

199
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,685
<i>with connections in the states</i>
<i>called in a few favors.</i>

200
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:17,155
<i>He needed someone to observe</i>
<i>and report on a situation</i>

201
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,357
<i>so he could scare up</i>
<i>some U.S. military aid.</i>

202
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,526
<i>And I was the lucky guy</i>

203
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,828
<i>who got to do the observing</i>
<i>and reporting.</i>

204
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,030
So, I read the file, but I was
hoping you could fill me in

205
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,365
on the basics
of the situation.

206
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,001
I was dropped into this
a little...suddenly.

207
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,969
This group, the so-called
"Espada Ardiente,"

208
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,306
has been staging serious attacks
all over this countryside.

209
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,476
And the situation is getting
only worse and worse.

210
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,211
We need help.
Espada Ardiente.

211
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,047
Is that some kind of homegrown
insurgent group?

212
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,183
Yes. Actually,
we don't know much about them.

213
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,219
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

214
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,987
Will you follow me,
please?

215
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,355
Commandante Veracruz!

216
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,758
Let me introduce
Commander Axe.

217
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,060
It is a pleasure,
Commander Axe.

218
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,696
Commandante Veracruz
has worked before with American soldiers.

219
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,131
He is at your disposal.

220
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,966
I believe we have
mutual acquaintances.

221
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,302
I trained at the school
of the Americas in '92.

222
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,204
Well, hell,
if you trained there in '92,

223
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,738
I knew every last
son of a bitch

224
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,340
that made you do push-ups
in the mud.

225
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,609
Vick Rayburn.
No, no, no. You mean...

226
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,543
"The terror."
That's the guy.
..."The terror." Of course.

227
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,212
So, what's the plan?

228
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,349
We have intelligence
that Espada Ardiente

229
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,018
is planning to attack
an international clinic

230
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,221
run by a group
called "Doctors For All."

231
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,325
A hospital. Seriously?
Unfortunately, yes.

232
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,560
Until now, they have stayed
clear of civilian targets.

233
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,596
The clinic sits in a strategic
pass in the mountains.

234
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,731
We believe the terrorists
want to use it

235
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,433
to take control
of that region.

236
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,135
Our plan is for you
and Commandante Veracruz

237
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,338
to get there
before that can happen.

238
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,073
I trust we are
in good hands?

239
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,508
Of course.
Thank you, sir.

240
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,775
Goodbye.

241
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,010
Let's meet the guys.
Fantastic. Please.

242
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,044
Hello, señor.

243
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,946
Whoa, oh!

244
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,849
<i>So it was the standard drill.</i>
<i>I met Veracruz's team.</i>

245
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,918
<i>And we headed out up the</i>
<i>mountains toward the territory</i>

246
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,356
<i>that this Espada Ardiente group</i>
<i>was occupying.</i>

247
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,761
<i>Spent a couple days</i>
<i>driving up and down mountains</i>

248
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,230
<i>and getting carsick.</i>

249
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,966
<i>Not much to report, at least</i>
<i>until we got further north</i>

250
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,234
<i>and started seeing</i>
<i>some of the places</i>

251
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,103
<i>these guys had attacked.</i>

252
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,571
<i>It was mostly little stuff --</i>

253
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,439
<i>blown-up vehicles,</i>
<i>burned campsites --</i>

254
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,241
<i>but it was enough</i>
<i>to make me think</i>

255
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,809
<i>we needed to get</i>
<i>to this clinic asap,</i>

256
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,244
<i>make sure nothing happened.</i>

257
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,680
<i>The clinic</i>
<i>was conveniently located</i>

258
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,881
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

259
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,383
<i>After our long trek there,</i>

260
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,552
<i>I figured they'd offer us</i>
<i>a beer for our trouble.</i>

261
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,854
<i>But they weren't exactly happy</i>
<i>to see us.</i>

262
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,455
Okay, this is --
this is just crazy.

263
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:34,025
Why would anyone attack the clinic?
I'm sorry, doctor.

264
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,561
But our intelligence indicates
there may be an attack.

265
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,062
And so what are we
supposed to do, hmm?

266
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,197
Uh, evacuate?
That would be best.

267
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:41,832
We can give you
until tomorrow to --
to -- to --

268
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tomorr--

269
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,969
listen, I've got people in there
too sick to move.

270
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,704
Now, how am I supposed to
evacuate by t--

271
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,506
Okay. Hey, guys. Hey.
You know, let me handle this.

272
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,674
American to American.

273
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,742
I'm Canadian.

274
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,046
Uh, North American
to North American?

275
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:57,381
Look, you know, we're not trying
to bust your chops here,

276
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,517
but you're not gonna help your
patients if you guys get shot.

277
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,018
Listen, sir,
we don't have any problems

278
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,254
with the Espada Ardiente,
okay?

279
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,523
<i>Un segundo, un segundo.</i>
<i>Okay, please.</i>

280
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,292
So -- so just tell me,
how am I supposed to

281
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,027
evacuate my clinic by tomorrow?
Hey, Ben.

282
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,329
Hi.

283
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,864
Why don't you go
and take care of the patient?

284
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:16,167
And I've got this.

285
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,535
Yeah?

286
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,036
This way, soldier.

287
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:21,105
It's, uh, "Commander,"
actually.

288
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,107
Sorry about that.

289
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,342
Yeah,
what's his problem?

290
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,711
He's a doctor.
It's his job to cure people.

291
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:29,280
You're a soldier.
It's your job to kill them.

292
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,749
Take a wild guess what his
problem might be, bright eyes.

293
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,950
And you are?

294
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,185
Amanda Maples.

295
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,786
I'm with the local
food relief program.

296
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:37,254
We work out of the clinic.

297
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:39,390
Nice threads, by the way.
Really subtle.

298
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,691
Yeah. It's a long story.
Ah.

299
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,760
So, you want to talk
to your buddy in there?

300
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,694
'Cause you guys
could be in danger.

301
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,062
Yeah, I'll do my best.

302
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,764
For now, though,
we'd all really appreciate it

303
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,432
if you'd get lost.

304
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,301
'Cause if we weren't
a target before,

305
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,436
we definitely will be
if you guys don't leave.

306
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:54,338
As a soldier,
I can't just leave.

307
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,041
Sure you can. You just --
you get in the truck.

308
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,709
And you turn the key,

309
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,177
you put your foot on the
pedal -- it's on the floor --

310
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:01,278
and you go.

311
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:19,397
What's going on?
Who's the kid?

312
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,198
She may be with one
of the terrorists.

313
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,300
We caught her sneaking
into one of the trucks.

314
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:24,535
Aah!
Hey, hey.

315
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,469
Everybody
just calm down here.

316
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,972
Geez. Okay.

317
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,306
So, kid...

318
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,481
Okay, guys, come on.

319
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,384
She's just looking for something
to eat. Let's not go crazy.

320
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,953
It's not our mission to rough up
hungry teenagers, right?

321
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,523
No. Of course.
Of course. Of course.

322
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,026
Here you go, kid.

323
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,733
So, look,
I talked to the doctor

324
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,001
and the lady
from the food-aid program,

325
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,303
but they don't know anything
about an attack.

326
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,074
All I got out of them was a
polite invitation to screw off.

327
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,675
We will make camp nearby.

328
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,511
If there is an attack,
we will be ready.

329
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:19,223
<i>Veracruz's camp</i>
<i>was pretty remote.</i>

330
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,727
<i>But let me tell you, his guys</i>
<i>were seriously well-armed.</i>

331
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,863
<i>I didn't know exactly</i>
<i>who we were up against yet,</i>

332
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,499
<i>but they had enough firepower</i>
<i>to wipe them off the map.</i>

333
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,669
<i>So I decided I'd just keep</i>
<i>my head down, do my job,</i>

334
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,071
<i>and make my reports to H.Q.</i>
<i>Like a good boy.</i>

335
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,112
Commander Axe
for Admiral Maitland, please.

336
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:44,115
Yes, sir, uh, no contact
with any terrorists yet, sir.

337
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,616
We're a couple of miles
from the clinic.

338
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,152
Good. Carry on
as long as it takes.

339
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,423
Sir, what exactly does
"as long as it takes" mean?

340
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,825
It means "next time,

341
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,495
stay away from the wives
of ranking officers."

342
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,029
Uh...

343
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,132
See you in a few months.
Roger that.

344
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,167
Hey. Just calling to command
to let them know what's up.

345
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,237
Fantastic. Perhaps you would
like to relax, eat some supper?

346
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:07,671
My men and I are
going to scout the area.

347
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,473
Oh, good. Well, I'll go with
you. My gear's right in there.

348
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,809
Actually, señor, it is better
if you stay here.

349
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,043
Whoa. Stay here?

350
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,712
I mean, I can't exactly
observe and report

351
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,147
from the inside of my tent,
can I?

352
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:18,048
Come on, I can handle
a little night scouting, huh?

353
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,517
I'm sure you can,
Commander Axe.

354
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,952
But I am responsible
for your safety.

355
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,954
If we make contact
with the terrorists,

356
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,823
we will come for you
immediately.

357
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:35,065
This is where things
kind of started to go sideways.

358
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,801
You might want to mark that down
in your notes.

359
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,569
"Things went sideways."

360
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,904
So, what did you do?

361
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:44,041
I guess you could say
I modified my orders.

362
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,984
Well, señor...

363
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,658
<i>Buenos noches.</i>

364
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,104
<i>So I decided to conduct</i>
<i>a scout of my own.</i>

365
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,520
<i>I did a basic perimeter check.</i>

366
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,522
<i>Searched for tire tracks,</i>
<i>signs of activity.</i>

367
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,691
<i>The only hostile forces I found</i>

368
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:36,026
<i>was a nest of spiders</i>
<i>as big as quarters.</i>

369
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,562
<i>And in the middle of fighting</i>
<i>those little bastards off,</i>

370
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,997
<i>I hear voices.</i>

371
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,738
<i>I go in, check it out,</i>

372
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,240
<i>thinking maybe it was</i>
<i>the Espada Ardiente guys.</i>

373
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,675
<i>But what do I find instead?</i>

374
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,377
<i>Veracruz,</i>
<i>unloading a bunch of weapons</i>

375
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,479
<i>from a hidey-hole</i>
<i>in the mountain.</i>

376
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,214
<i>I listen in</i>
<i>on their conversation,</i>

377
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,049
<i>and guess what I hear --</i>

378
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,852
<i>they're planning on attacking</i>
<i>the clinic themselves</i>

379
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,754
<i>and making it look</i>
<i>like the rebels did it.</i>

380
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,489
<i>And after I make my report...</i>

381
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,192
We destroy the clinic then shoot
the American in the head.

382
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,929
Son of a bitch.

383
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,765
<i>I bet lots of stuff</i>
<i>go bad in an operations.</i>

384
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,253
<i>But finding out</i>
<i>I was supposed to get killed</i>

385
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,688
<i>as part of a plot</i>
<i>to get U.S. military aid?</i>

386
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:21,856
<i>That was a new one.</i>

387
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:23,524
<i>So I just stayed calm</i>

388
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,560
<i>and made my way back to camp</i>
<i>as efficiently as possible.</i>

389
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,362
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

390
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,098
L-l-let's go back, here.
I'm confused.

391
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,766
Y-you're saying
you did not make contact

392
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,135
with Espada Ardiente
at this point?

393
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,337
- Because our reports indicate --
- Well, where did you get the reports?

394
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,239
From Veracruz's
paramilitaries?

395
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,108
And, what, you think
they were gonna announce

396
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,442
that they were
officially planning

397
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,844
on putting two in the back
of my head?

398
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,078
What I really
want to hear about

399
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,115
is how you were kidnapped
by terrorist forces.

400
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:51,919
Oh. Yeah, well,
that's not entirely accurate.

401
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,557
<i>See, I couldn't let Veracruz</i>
<i>know that I was onto him.</i>

402
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,560
<i>So I put together</i>

403
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,162
<i>a little kidnapping scene</i>
<i>for them to find</i>

404
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,997
<i>and double-timed it</i>
<i>back to the clinic.</i>

405
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,207
Man, what -- what the hell
are you doing down here, man?

406
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,076
It's 5:00 a.m.

407
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:17,178
You and me need to talk.
Now.

408
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,949
Okay, so,
I-I-I'm confused here.

409
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,218
Why would anybody
want to attack us?

410
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,553
Because it's a ploy.

411
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,954
If they can make
this terrorist group

412
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,524
look like they massacred
a clinic and killed yours truly,

413
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,259
Veracruz can do
anything he wants down here

414
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,727
and get a blank check to do it.

415
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:36,864
Right, but here's the thing --
we're not political. Okay?

416
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,499
I've never even heard
of the es-- w-what is it?

417
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,701
Espada Ardiente.
Yeah.

418
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,269
Yeah.
It happens all the time.

419
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,770
I saw it when I worked
in Africa.

420
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,739
Some military group
needs aid,

421
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,407
so they do something
really terrible

422
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,709
and blame it
on their enemies.

423
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,748
The point is, you guys
got to move fast, okay?

424
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,516
So, in the meantime,
I need your sat phone.

425
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,687
Yeah, okay.
Good luck there.

426
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:02,256
When we need to make a call, we have
to go all the way to Santa Marta.

427
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,058
Seriously?
You got nothing?

428
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,294
Hey, we're not
the Mayo Clinic.

429
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,562
And quick question --

430
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,063
how do you propose that
we get out of here?

431
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,765
On our --
on our Medevac helicopter?

432
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,066
Or our fleet of ambulances?

433
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,835
We are a tiny clinic
in the mountains.

434
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,037
I'm not the one
you're fighting here.

435
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,538
I'm just trying to
lay it out for you.

436
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:19,107
And we appreciate it.

437
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:22,210
But this Veracruz of yours
is looking for you,

438
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,678
and we can't have him
finding you here.

439
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,615
So...just go.
We can take care of ourselves.

440
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,400
He must have
been kidnapped.

441
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,168
Did you hear anything else?
No, nothing.

442
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,270
Sorry, Commander.
It's okay.

443
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,506
You still have an important role to this
mission, señor Garcia.

444
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,307
When I tell the Americans
what happened,

445
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,409
I will say
you bravely tried

446
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,177
to fight off
the Espada Ardiente.

447
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:57,445
But sadly...

448
00:19:58,881 --> 00:19:59,814
You were killed.

449
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,187
Throw his body
in the ravine

450
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,722
and take pictures
for the report.

451
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,990
And the clinic?

452
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,892
With the American gone,
there's no use waiting.

453
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,361
We will destroy the clinic
ourselves and make the report.

454
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,297
<i>So the bad news was Veracruz</i>
<i>was making his move early --</i>

455
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,000
<i>a fact I learned</i>
<i>when I ran into a familiar face</i>

456
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,401
<i>on the road.</i>

457
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,469
Oh. Jesus, what --

458
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,039
You're the kid from earlier,
right? The food thief?

459
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,407
What the hell
are you doing back here?

460
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,942
I'm trying to get people
out of the clinic.

461
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,877
Okay. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

462
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,813
Slow down a second.
Since when do you speak English?

463
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,314
I used to watch
"Full House."

464
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,917
You know, Veracruz is coming!
We have to go!

465
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,218
Veracruz?
How do you know he's coming?

466
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:38,619
I was watching his camp.

467
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:39,887
You were <i>spying</i>
<i>on his camp.</i>

468
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:42,156
I wasn't spying.
I was trying to steal food.

469
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:43,324
And they caught me,
and then I tried again.

470
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:44,692
What do you care?!

471
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,028
Veracruz shot one of his men
for letting you escape!

472
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:50,698
He's on his way here now!
He's on his way here now!

473
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,703
Hey. Whoa. Oh.

474
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:56,804
No, no.
Not you again.

475
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,039
I thought
I told you to go --

476
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:00,174
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
I got a new plan.

477
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:01,609
We're gonna get everybody
out of here. Now.

478
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,944
Uh, c-commander,
could you maybe --

479
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,412
can you slow down
and then explain?

480
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
Yeah.
This is not the time to slow down.

481
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,049
Veracruz and his men are
on their way here right now.

482
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,851
And with these roads,
we got about 30 minutes.

483
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,786
Hey, can you be a sweetheart?
Grab these oxygen tanks.

484
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:12,920
Wait,
I thought you said

485
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,755
that Veracruz wasn't coming
until later.

486
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,557
Yeah, he changed his mind.
Funny how that happens.

487
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,259
Okay, what are y'all doing
with my stuff?

488
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,728
Let me ask you -- do you have
a secret cache of weapons

489
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,730
around here
that I don't know about?

490
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,432
No, I don't have
a secret cache of weapons.

491
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,533
Right.
I didn't think so.

492
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,301
Here you go, kiddo.

493
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,304
So, between, uh, these tanks
and the fuel out back,

494
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,373
we should have just enough
to blow the place.

495
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,808
What?! No! Whoa!
No, no, no!

496
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,177
You're not going to
destroy the clinic!

497
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,446
Isn't Veracruz coming
to do the same exact thing?

498
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,181
No, Veracruz wants to
destroy the clinic

499
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:41,482
with the people inside.

500
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,117
I want to destroy the clinic

501
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:44,485
to create a distraction
to save the people.

502
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,753
Little bit
of a difference.

503
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,655
Okay, this is insane.
No, you can't do this.

504
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,257
Look, guys,
you can't really believe

505
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,025
that Veracruz's guys
are not gonna see

506
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,628
everybody leaving?
We got to cover our tracks.

507
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,263
He's right, guys.
It's the best way.

508
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,632
See? The teenage thief girl
agrees with me.

509
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,268
Now, boys and girls,
this is happening.

510
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,870
You stay here, you die.
You come with me...

511
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,038
We live?

512
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:05,806
Well, the odds
are a little better.

513
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:07,141
So, look,
let's do this.

514
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,843
Get the patients outside,
load them in the trucks,

515
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,512
and let me know
if you see any bad guys.

516
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,282
I can't believe
we're doing this.

517
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:15,516
What about me?

518
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,151
You and me are gonna build a bomb.
Oh.

519
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,352
We're gonna
build a bomb.

520
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:23,190
Okay, we got diesel, oxygen,
propane out back...

521
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,559
The whatchamacallit

522
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,227
that's my defibrillator.
Right.

523
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,462
You wouldn't happen to have
any nitrous oxide, would you?

524
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,632
No. We are a bush hospital.
Not a suburban dentist's office.

525
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,067
Look, what am I supposed to
be doing here?

526
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:35,002
Hold on. Okay, great.

527
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,038
Take that.
This is your detonator.

528
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,839
Yeah. That's gonna go --
okay.

529
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,108
Tape that right on top of that valve.
Okay.

530
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:44,679
Real quick -- the warning label
says "keep away --"

531
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,547
Yeah. That's right.
We're building a bomb, okay?

532
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,449
So you do the opposite of what
the warning label says.

533
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,197
Hey, how we doing
out here?

534
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:05,099
My God. She ran off,
and she won't stop crying.

535
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:09,370
Hey, hey, sister.
Easy, now.

536
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,705
Now, I'm not an expert here,
but I don't think

537
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:11,906
that's how you get a kid
to stop crying.

538
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,821
Sí. Blech!

539
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,664
<i>Rápido, por favor.</i>

540
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:37,665
Easy-peasy.

541
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,677
Let's get the hell out of here.

542
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,579
You set up everything
like I told you?

543
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,114
Yes, yes, yes, I did --
I set my tank

544
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,383
by the support beam at the front
just like you said.

545
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,284
Are you sure you got it right?
We can only push this button once.

546
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,819
No, I'm not sure
if I got it right.

547
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,588
How am I supposed to
know if I got it right?

548
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:05,793
Okay, people,
the second I hit this,

549
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,294
that thing goes,
we got to be on the move.

550
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,096
It's the smoke and the fire
that's gonna cover our escape.

551
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:15,136
Okay.
Here goes nothing.

552
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,443
I didn't mean it that way.
New plan.

553
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,512
A new plan? I got to trigger it manually.
What do you mean?

554
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,313
Manually?
No, no, no, no, no!

555
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,248
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Stay in the truck!

556
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,483
No. Maybe I can fix it.

557
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,484
Maybe I can --

558
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:49,036
I guess you fixed it.

559
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,179
What the hell did you do?
I maximized the pressure.

560
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,814
Because you told me -- you told
me to maximize the pressure!

561
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:01,215
Yeah, I know. I just didn't know
you were gonna do it so well.

562
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:02,983
You got talent.

563
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,752
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

564
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,020
We're safe, then.

565
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,989
Oh, no.
We're a long way from safe.

566
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:18,159
Uh, sorry to keep
you guys waiting.

567
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:21,980
Uh, sir, do you know that they
locked me in my room last night?

568
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:23,882
So I got to say, this is
starting to feel less and less

569
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,417
like an "informal conversation."

570
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,118
Still just an inquiry,
Commander.

571
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:29,020
Although after
yesterday's testimony,

572
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,722
I wouldn't make
any travel plans.

573
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,425
Thanks for the heads-up.

574
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,061
Now, amidst all the tales
of your heroics,

575
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:39,164
we seem to have lost sight
of your initial mission,

576
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:40,765
which is gathering intel

577
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,168
on a terrorist organization
known as "Espada Ardiente."

578
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:46,338
Right. I was just getting
to that, actually.

579
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:50,976
So, after the unfortunate
sacrifice of the clinic,

580
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,678
we all regrouped
a few miles up the road.

581
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:55,513
Well, they're not after us
just yet.

582
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,849
I'm guessing that by the time
they sort things out,

583
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,085
we're gonna have
about an hour head start.

584
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:03,421
An hour? All of that back there
bought us an hour?

585
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:04,923
Is that supposed to
be good news?

586
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:06,491
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

587
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,393
It's better than a minute,
worse than a day.

588
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:10,762
So in the meantime, we got to get
those folks someplace we can hide.

589
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,265
The closest town
is Santa Rosa.

590
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:15,734
Yes, yes. .
There's a clinic there.

591
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,103
Yeah, unfortunately, we can't go
to the nearest town that has a clinic.

592
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,372
It's the first place they're gonna be
looking for a bunch of sick people.

593
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,040
They need medical
attention, okay?

594
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,675
- Why don't we just drop them off?
- Well, you might as well

595
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,310
hand them over to Veracruz
and save on gas.

596
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:26,411
Now,
where else can we go?

597
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,013
No place else.

598
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,147
All the other
so-called villages

599
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:31,383
are just a bunch of houses
and a church.

600
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,952
I know a place.

601
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,921
A camp, nearby.

602
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,923
A camp? Whose camp?

603
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,492
Espada Ardiente.

604
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,627
Oh. Okay.

605
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,529
Do you remember back when you
were just a hungry teenager

606
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:46,064
who couldn't speak English?

607
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,633
You said you'd never even heard
of the Espada Ardiente.

608
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:50,135
I lied.

609
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:52,737
They can help us.
They can hide the sick ones.

610
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,606
You know what?

611
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:57,242
I don't think
we have any other choice.

612
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:01,746
Looks like we're going with
little miss terrorist here.

613
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:05,550
Just to clarify,
Commander --

614
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:06,985
you decided to join the group

615
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,954
that you were sent to Colombia
to investigate?

616
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:11,323
Well, "join" is kind of
a strong word, sir.

617
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,091
I mean, uh,
we were in trouble,

618
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:15,560
and there were not a lot
of options in the area.

619
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:16,995
All right.

620
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:19,564
And this Beatriz you mention.
I have no record of her.

621
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:21,700
Well, that's not surprising.
She's a kid.

622
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,135
She's a kid who led you
to a suspected terrorist camp.

623
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:25,570
What do you want me to say?

624
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:27,739
I mean, she was
a mystery to me, too.

625
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:30,342
This kid --

626
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:31,910
well, sir, you would understand
if you met her.

627
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,648
Okay, so, um...

628
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:39,217
Why am I the only one
wearing a blindfold?

629
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:40,652
'Cause
I don't trust you.

630
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,389
- You're a soldier.
- Oh, that's why.

631
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,824
Do your parents know

632
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:47,625
that you hang out
with the Espada Ardiente?

633
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,861
- Don't talk about my parents!
- Okay. Hey. Easy.

634
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,630
You know, what I'm
trying to say is this --

635
00:27:52,698 --> 00:27:54,199
most girls your age

636
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:56,835
are into, you know,
makeup and stuff, malls.

637
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:58,703
Do you see any shopping malls
around here?

638
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:00,572
Uh, no.
You blindfolded me, remember?

639
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,874
There are none.
So no more questions.

640
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,876
Okay, look,
I'm not trying to pry.

641
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:07,512
I'm just curious how you
hooked up with these guys.

642
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,648
They're my friends.

643
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:12,584
Okay.

644
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,252
So, how much longer
till we get to your friends?

645
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,487
I got to get my hands

646
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:17,389
on their communications
equipment and call in.

647
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:22,427
Uncover your eyes.
We're here.

648
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:33,405
You got to be kidding.

649
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,443
This?

650
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:40,612
This is
the Espada Ardiente?

651
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,147
Yes.
Is there a problem?

652
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:43,615
What -- well, this is,
like, 12 guys.

653
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,050
I was hoping
for some kind of army

654
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:47,619
or something to keep us
from getting massacred.

655
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,054
Look, Espada Ardiente is --
and what does that mean, anyway?

656
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:50,522
"Flaming"
something or other.

657
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:52,023
"Sword"!
You don't understand!

658
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:55,026
"Ardiente" means
fearless, passionate.

659
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:56,528
We burn to defeat
our enemies.

660
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:58,530
Right, okay. I got it.
The "flaming sword."

661
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:00,098
So what if they're small?

662
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,733
We can fight
just as hard as anyone!

663
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,902
Look, I hate to cut
your speech short, sweetheart.

664
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:07,405
But you know what?
The size of your army matters.

665
00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:09,274
Okay?
It matters a lot.

666
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:13,011
I mean, you're not gonna win
a war with a flock of sheep.

667
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,345
Look, it's all
about firepower.

668
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:15,814
Do these guys
have any equipment?

669
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,582
Most of our men
have hunting rifles.

670
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,850
Ammunition is low,
but --

671
00:29:18,918 --> 00:29:20,452
You're not making me feel
any better, here, kid.

672
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,686
Or how about experience?

673
00:29:21,754 --> 00:29:23,188
Some of them
were in the army.

674
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:25,824
And our best fighter
is Luis.

675
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:26,791
Oh,
the big guy there?

676
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:30,128
No.
The one next to him.

677
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,399
Wonderful.

678
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:39,037
These guys took out a truck
full of paramilitary troops?

679
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:41,039
How do you figure that?

680
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,174
Luis shot the tires out of their truck,
and it went down the hill.

681
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,576
They killed his goats!

682
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:47,745
His -- his goats?
You're serious?

683
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:49,447
Your best fighter
is a goat herder?!

684
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:52,150
Goat herders? Really?

685
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:06,498
<i>Ihola! Ihola!</i>

686
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:20,311
Ben.

687
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:23,047
Oh, no. Is her cough back?
Let me see.

688
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,783
Okay, so,
I did a little recon,

689
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:28,019
gathered a little intel.

690
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:29,320
First thing --

691
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:30,855
you really shouldn't call them
filthy goat herders.

692
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,290
I didn't call them filthy.

693
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,325
And the only reason I called
the one guy a goat herder

694
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:37,762
is 'cause he has goats
and he herds them.

695
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,365
Yeah. They're farmers.

696
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,834
Anyway, seems their land
is valuable

697
00:30:42,902 --> 00:30:45,537
as some sort of drug transport
to the coast.

698
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:48,373
So someone paid off Veracruz
to force them out.

699
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,708
They fought back,
got lucky a few times --

700
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:52,343
and Veracruz thought they were
bigger than they actually were.

701
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,645
Pretty much.

702
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:58,183
Okay, listen.
Guys, she's got malaria.

703
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,719
Okay, and without the right
medicine, she could die soon.

704
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:03,621
Look, I'm tap-dancing
as fast as I can here.

705
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:05,490
I'm just trying to keep
everybody breathing.

706
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:08,526
Me too, man.
Me too.

707
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:20,071
The man wants to know
why your pants are blue.

708
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:23,174
The jungle is green.

709
00:31:23,242 --> 00:31:25,376
Please tell the man that
I don't want to talk about it.

710
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,517
So,
what's with Beatriz?

711
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:35,520
She seems to have,
uh, anger issues.

712
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:37,155
It's, uh, kind of par
for the course

713
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:39,157
when you see your father shot
in front of you.

714
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:42,460
And she wandered
into the Espada Ardiente camp

715
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:44,696
the next day,
and they took her in.

716
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:47,799
So she's, what,
the mascot?

717
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,834
Yeah.
Something like that.

718
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:51,970
Oh, uh, one more thing.
You have a new name in camp.

719
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,872
"La barbilla."

720
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,007
"Barbilla."
What's that again?

721
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,209
Um, "barbarian"
or something?

722
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:01,112
No. "The chin."

723
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,120
The chin.
Doesn't make any sense.

724
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,403
They train every morning.

725
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:27,272
It's the same thing
they do in the army.

726
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:31,376
I'm pretty sure in the army
they fire their guns.

727
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:32,810
You think that's funny?
Are you laughing at them?

728
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:34,646
No, I don't think
it's funny, kid.

729
00:32:34,713 --> 00:32:36,447
I think
it's anything but.

730
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,249
But is is not an army.
They got no training.

731
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:40,418
Luis there
is about 100 years old.

732
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:42,487
Don't even get me started
on the big guy there.

733
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,924
They need weapons!
And I know you can help them!

734
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,926
I saw you back at the clinic,
and you made those explosives.

735
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:51,462
They need more than weapons.
Trust me -- in a real fight,

736
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,031
these chumps
would get slaughtered.

737
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,533
Aah!

738
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:59,470
Hey. Just having
a conversation here.

739
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:00,938
Nothing to look at.

740
00:33:01,006 --> 00:33:02,140
Everything's cool.

741
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,142
Now, look, I'm sorry
about your dad, okay?

742
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,311
And I'm sure that your flaming
sword buddies are very brave.

743
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:11,449
But believe me -- brave guys
bleed just like everybody else.

744
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,591
What do you think?

745
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:23,094
Uh, the truth?
They need help more than we do.

746
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:25,897
A-and so what does that mean?
Are we -- are we stuck here?

747
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,266
No, it means I got to figure out
a way to call back to my C.O.,

748
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:29,834
get him
to shut Veracruz down.

749
00:33:29,902 --> 00:33:31,169
All right.
We've been over this.

750
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:33,738
There isn't a phone
for 200 miles from here.

751
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:35,106
Veracruz
has a sat phone.

752
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:37,475
Yeah, but, wait.
You can't go back to Veracruz.

753
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:39,077
Well, why not?
I mean, right now he thinks

754
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:40,945
I've been kidnapped
by our new friends there.

755
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:42,880
I'll just go back and tell him I escaped.
Oh, yeah.

756
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:45,249
And he's gonna be like, "oh, my
God, it's so good to see you,"

757
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,485
and hug you
and shoot you in the head.

758
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:49,354
No, I doubt it. He needs me
to help him sell the story

759
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:50,788
about the flaming sword.

760
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:53,191
Should be enough
to call out.

761
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:54,359
Hey.

762
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:56,994
What if you're wrong?

763
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:58,763
Well, then, I get shot,

764
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:01,232
and you try your luck
with the goat herders.

765
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,604
Try it!

766
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,607
Okay, uh, better get going.

767
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:20,943
I want to get to Veracruz
before he makes camp.

768
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,411
Before you go,
I want to ask you something.

769
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,714
Are you really
gonna do this?

770
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,883
Are you really gonna
go for help?

771
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:30,385
Yeah,
it's like I told you.

772
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:32,821
- I'm gonna go back, make a call --
- People say a lot of things.

773
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:36,992
Now, I just got everybody out
of the clinic safe, didn't I?

774
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,560
I mean, what does a guy
have to do

775
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,095
to get some credibility
around here?

776
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,930
I've been in hot spots
all over the globe.

777
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:45,434
And when things first get rough,
everyone's a hero.

778
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:49,571
And then reality sets in,
and promises are broken.

779
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:54,910
And if you let these people
down, I want you to know

780
00:34:54,978 --> 00:34:57,846
that I will personally find you
and kick your teeth in.

781
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:04,052
Amanda, I'm not gonna
let anybody down.

782
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,756
I may get my ass shot off,
but...

783
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:09,024
My teeth are safe.

784
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:10,225
Before we move on,

785
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:11,460
Espada Ardiente's leadership

786
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,162
consisted of this man,
Louis Mendez,

787
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,265
of the Colombian
armed forces.

788
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:17,866
His name was Luis.

789
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,635
And, yeah,
that looks like him...

790
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:20,903
About 100 years ago.

791
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,204
He looks good
in uniform.

792
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:28,043
Did you gather any more intel
on their command structure?

793
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:29,511
They were farmers.

794
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,046
They didn't have command
structures. They had sheep.

795
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:32,447
Why do you think I was going
to get some help?

796
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:35,250
Okay. Fine.

797
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:38,020
We'll come back to that.

798
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:39,488
What happened
after you left?

799
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:42,624
Well, I drove back
toward Veracruz.

800
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,059
I mean, I knew
his team's drill well enough

801
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:45,494
to find a scout or two.

802
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:51,867
<i>Once I got to the neighborhood,</i>
<i>I ditched the truck,</i>

803
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:55,704
<i>put on a little</i>
<i>kidnapping makeup...</i>

804
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,978
<i>...And hoofed it</i>
<i>until I ran into a couple</i>

805
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:05,714
<i>of Veracruz's scouts.</i>

806
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:32,240
Oh, man. It was horrible.

807
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:35,477
They were working me over,
asking all kinds of things.

808
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:36,945
How did you escape?

809
00:36:37,013 --> 00:36:38,380
I was lucky.

810
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,649
They only sent a couple guys
with me to <i>el baño,</i>

811
00:36:40,717 --> 00:36:42,351
and I managed to run off.

812
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:43,819
We searched for you
everywhere.

813
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:45,754
When the terrorists blew up
the clinic, we feared the worst.

814
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:47,589
It wasn't "the worst," but
it was still pretty damn bad.

815
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:48,790
You know
they were setting up

816
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,092
to give me the
car-battery treatment?

817
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,526
These guys
are frickin' monsters!

818
00:36:51,594 --> 00:36:52,894
Yes, they are.

819
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,730
Now you see why we need your
help fighting this menace.

820
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:58,500
100%. I say we track them down
and light these bastards up.

821
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:01,803
Excellent. Good to have you
back, Commander Axe.

822
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:12,881
We need help. Okay?
Asap!

823
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:15,484
Okay, Commander.
I understand.

824
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:17,552
But let me ask you this --

825
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,688
how the hell
did this happen?!

826
00:37:19,756 --> 00:37:21,623
You're supposed to be down there
observing and reporting,

827
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:22,824
not starting
some guerilla war!

828
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,459
Well, I observed
the sons of bitches

829
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:26,294
trying to kill me
and massacre hospital,

830
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:27,763
and I'm reporting it.

831
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,431
All right, look,
I'll make some calls.

832
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,066
But, Axe, if this
is some cheap ploy

833
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:32,634
to get yourself
pulled out of there...

834
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:33,935
It's not about me.

835
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,171
Now, you help these people,
I will gladly let you

836
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,707
kick my butt at a time
and place of your choosing.

837
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:41,009
But, please, for the love
of God -- I got to go.

838
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:45,547
Axe.

839
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,717
The men are ready.
We should start looking

840
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,086
for the terrorists before
they have time to move.

841
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:54,056
Yes, we should. Time for a
little payback, am I right?

842
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,894
<i>So, at this point, I was just</i>
<i>trying to run out the clock.</i>

843
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,430
<i>I had to give the guys</i>
<i>from the flaming sword</i>

844
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:02,931
<i>enough time to get their truck</i>

845
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,433
<i>off the road</i>
<i>and back to their camp.</i>

846
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:08,804
<i>And I needed</i>
<i>to keep Veracruz's men busy</i>

847
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,372
<i>long enough for help to arrive.</i>

848
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,108
Yep. Pretty sure
we're going this way.

849
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:14,609
But, no.

850
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:17,245
That's not --
that's not it.

851
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:47,576
<i>Iperfecto! Iexactamente!</i>

852
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:04,359
Ah.

853
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,997
What is the delay?

854
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:10,832
Uh, well, I was just
talking to your boys here.

855
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,033
I was telling them
that the --

856
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,268
the camp
is pretty much up there.

857
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:16,304
See the tire tracks here?

858
00:39:16,372 --> 00:39:17,572
This is the same tread as
their vehicles that they use.

859
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,341
Yes, I can see.

860
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:21,810
You are
an excellent tracker.

861
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:25,313
You are also
an excellent liar.

862
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,651
What the hell
are you doing?

863
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,620
I just spoke with
Department Governor Perez.

864
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:34,656
His men intercepted your call
an hour ago.

865
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:36,858
Ay.

866
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:39,194
I am hurt you think
so little of me.

867
00:39:39,262 --> 00:39:41,997
You honestly thought I would
take no precautions?

868
00:39:42,064 --> 00:39:44,633
Hey, come on.

869
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,003
This is just a misunderstanding.
No.

870
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:52,841
No, I don't think
it is a misunderstanding.

871
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:56,077
I think I understand
very well.

872
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:59,748
Now...

873
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,850
Show me where they are
on the map.

874
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:08,256
You know, why should I?
You're gonna kill me anyway.

875
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,524
I might.

876
00:40:11,394 --> 00:40:14,429
And...I might not.

877
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,398
The question is whether
you want to die here,

878
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:18,900
or keep breathing
a bit longer

879
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,203
and hope you prove useful enough
to save.

880
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,040
Show me
where their camp is.

881
00:40:25,107 --> 00:40:26,641
If you are wrong...

882
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:29,644
I'll put a bullet
in your brain,

883
00:40:29,712 --> 00:40:30,946
and maybe that
will help you remember.

884
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:35,383
Uh, well,
come to think of it,

885
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:39,654
that -- that mountain range
does look familiar.

886
00:41:21,998 --> 00:41:25,800
So, how does it feel to be saved
by filthy goat herders?

887
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:28,236
Well, I owe you one, kid.
Let's go.

888
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:30,839
No, no, no, no. Not until you
promise not to insult them again.

889
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,044
Say what?

890
00:41:36,112 --> 00:41:38,079
- Promise.
- Oh, for God's sake. Okay, I promise.

891
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,382
They're the greatest
part-time farmer army ever!

892
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:41,383
Can we go?!

893
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,517
Geez!

894
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:52,093
Aah!

895
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:06,927
So, Veracruz saw
through your plan?

896
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:08,198
Oh, and it gets better.

897
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,866
Veracruz is looking around,
and he's close.

898
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:11,968
He's gonna find us
within 24 hours, tops.

899
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:15,505
Ok-- okay.
So what am I supposed to do?

900
00:42:15,573 --> 00:42:17,407
Because I got an old house
full of sick people --

901
00:42:17,475 --> 00:42:19,398
there's a CIA outpost
about 50 miles away.

902
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:20,401
50?

903
00:42:20,426 --> 00:42:22,728
The pilot who brought me down
here told me about it.

904
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:24,987
I think
it's our best bet.

905
00:42:25,074 --> 00:42:26,341
50 miles.
Are you on drugs?

906
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:29,477
Do they do testing
for soldiers?

907
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:32,647
Because we can't get all
of these people 50 <i>yards.</i>

908
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:34,182
I understand that.

909
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,918
Kid, can I talk to you
for a second?

910
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,219
What?

911
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:42,357
I want to
ask you something.

912
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:44,559
How did you end up
with these guys,

913
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:46,695
speaking English
like you do?

914
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:48,096
What do you care?

915
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:50,131
Well, because
we're in a tough spot,

916
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,001
and I'd like to know
who I'm dealing with.

917
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:57,138
My father
was a journalist.

918
00:42:57,206 --> 00:43:00,308
From <i>El Espectador</i>
<i>in Bogotá.</i>

919
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:01,743
He was in this area,

920
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:03,611
reporting on the situation
with the farmers.

921
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,647
That's what
got him shot?

922
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,549
Yes.

923
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:10,785
I knew Luis from the interviews
my father did.

924
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:17,559
I didn't know where else to go
a-after my father died.

925
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:22,464
So Luis brought me to the camp,
and he let me stay.

926
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:26,301
I'm glad he did.

927
00:43:26,368 --> 00:43:28,069
I need your help.

928
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:29,938
I got to put this little army
together.

929
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,340
But there's a problem --
those guys hate me,

930
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,042
and I speak Spanish
like a third grader.

931
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,479
But they like you, and you speak
English like a champ.

932
00:43:37,546 --> 00:43:39,681
So...
<i>Por favor?</i>

933
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:44,986
Talk to them.

934
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:47,489
And if I like what you have
to say, I will translate it.

935
00:43:47,556 --> 00:43:49,924
Esteemed gentlemen
of the flaming sword...

936
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:52,494
It's not "flaming" sword!

937
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:55,663
Oh, God, forget it.
Just talk. Just talk.

938
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:58,733
I know we didn't get off
to a great start.

939
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:02,403
I made some mistakes.

940
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,240
You made some mistakes.

941
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:10,578
Then there was
the whole goat-herd business.

942
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:13,748
It's not like
it didn't happen.

943
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,718
But that's behind us.

944
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:18,753
Now, I'm a soldier.

945
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,288
And I've got
all the training

946
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:21,523
and a fistful
of combat ribbons.

947
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,794
But today -- what?

948
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,762
Stick with me.
Okay.

949
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,533
But today I damn near
got my brains blown out.

950
00:44:33,702 --> 00:44:36,471
And the only reason why
I'm still breathing is because of you.

951
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:46,014
And that made me
realize something.

952
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,018
If we're gonna
save ourselves...

953
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:52,387
...And give Veracruz

954
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:55,123
the ass-whipping
he so richly deserves...

955
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:03,131
Was that what I said?

956
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,034
The point is that
we need to do it together.

957
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,405
So I'm standing here
before you today

958
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,739
to ask for your help.

959
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:16,878
Now, I've got a plan,

960
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:19,147
but it is not gonna fly
without you.

961
00:45:20,749 --> 00:45:22,417
So I need to know
right now...

962
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:25,220
...Are you with me?!

963
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,735
Espada Ardiente.

964
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:42,770
Espada Ardiente!

965
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:47,675
Okay,
now let's get training,

966
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:48,877
'cause, man,
we got to get organized.

967
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:50,478
Wait right there. Stop.

968
00:45:50,546 --> 00:45:53,081
You're saying that you were
training the terrorist group?

969
00:45:53,148 --> 00:45:55,683
Did you train them?
Yes or no?

970
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:58,620
Did you work with this man,
Louis Mendez?

971
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:00,655
Yeah, look, Luis was one
of the guys. He was on --

972
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:02,056
He was the senior operative

973
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:04,225
in the Colombian military
in the 1980s

974
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:06,527
until he disappeared,
presumably, to start this group!

975
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:10,398
And now you're giving this man
military secrets and training?

976
00:46:10,466 --> 00:46:12,500
All I can say, sir, is the only
secrets I gave away

977
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:14,135
were the secrets
of the Analee High School

978
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:16,104
J.V. football squad.

979
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:18,740
Okay, guys.
Listen up and listen good.

980
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:20,008
These are the plans
for battle.

981
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:24,646
This first one here
is called the nickel defense.

982
00:46:26,515 --> 00:46:29,717
If things get rough...

983
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:31,219
...The scouts fall back.

984
00:46:33,188 --> 00:46:37,325
This last one is called
the prevent defense.

985
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:42,230
Why is that?

986
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:44,399
They've all fallen back.

987
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:50,471
What the hell's
their problem?

988
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:52,407
All of these plans
are for retreating!

989
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:54,242
The men want to know what's
the plan for an attack!

990
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,777
No, they don't
need to know that one.

991
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:58,313
See, we're just trying to
keep them in the game. Mondo.

992
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:01,215
You're killing me.

993
00:47:01,283 --> 00:47:03,284
Okay, I have a plan
for attack.

994
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:06,521
It's called
the "zone blitz."

995
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,525
And it's all about disguise.
Let's hear you say it.

996
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,794
All together.
"Zone blitz!"

997
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:14,762
Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz! Z-zone blitz!

998
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,830
Z-zone blitz!
Z-zone blitz! Z-zone blitz!

999
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:17,031
Now let's just hope to God

1000
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,766
you never have to
say those words again.

1001
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:21,102
<i>Next day, we moved out</i>
<i>with the patients in one truck,</i>

1002
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,204
<i>and the flaming sword guys</i>
<i>packed in the others.</i>

1003
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:25,573
<i>It was only 50 miles, but when</i>
<i>the whole country is a mountain,</i>

1004
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:27,008
<i>miles are kind of</i>
<i>like dog years --</i>

1005
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:28,943
<i>every one more like seven.</i>

1006
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:30,812
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>there's the worst part</i>

1007
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:34,415
<i>of driving to a CIA outpost --</i>
<i>it's not gonna be on the map.</i>

1008
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:37,051
Quick update --
I didn't run away.

1009
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,486
I went to get help,
just like I said.

1010
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,621
Yes, and you almost
got yourself killed.

1011
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:42,290
That should
count double, then.

1012
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,758
Uh, why would it
count double?

1013
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:44,993
It only counts double

1014
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,961
if you actually come back
with some help.

1015
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,763
If you nearly die
a senseless death,

1016
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:49,931
that counts as,
like, half.

1017
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,165
Okay. Half.
Thank you.

1018
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,934
You're welcome.

1019
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:55,737
Okay, so,
tell me something.

1020
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:59,841
Do-gooder...
Food-aid worker...

1021
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:02,076
I mean, why so cynical?

1022
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:04,212
If you're asking that,
you probably haven't spent

1023
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:05,847
a whole lot of time
around aid workers.

1024
00:48:05,914 --> 00:48:07,949
Okay.

1025
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:11,319
Well, I mean,
you get into this

1026
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,788
because you want to make
the world a better place,

1027
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:16,057
and it turns out
that there's a lot of people

1028
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,792
who want to make it
a worse place.

1029
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,728
And we're outnumbered.
By a lot.

1030
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:22,296
By soldiers, you mean?

1031
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,499
Not just soldiers.

1032
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:26,834
But usually, when there are
people are going hungry,

1033
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:29,103
there's some guy with a gun
making it happen.

1034
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,608
Speaking of hunger,
you haven't been eating.

1035
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:34,876
Why is that?

1036
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:36,744
These guys need it more than me.
Believe me.

1037
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:39,247
I figure it this way --
if we make it,

1038
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:41,082
I got a head start on
the 10 pounds I want to lose,

1039
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,053
and if we don't, well,
dead guys don't get hungry.

1040
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:51,125
You're not like
the other soldiers I've met,

1041
00:48:51,193 --> 00:48:52,293
Commander Axe.

1042
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:53,361
I'll give you that.

1043
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,030
Call me Sam.

1044
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:58,433
Sam it is.

1045
00:49:00,302 --> 00:49:01,669
I know that you want me
to kiss you right now.

1046
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,438
- And, believe me, I would love to.
- What?

1047
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:05,239
But I'm just saying,
it's a bad time, is all.

1048
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:06,808
- No, no.
- Any other time, I'd be all over it.

1049
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,476
Oh. <i>No comprende.</i>
<i>Seriously.</i>

1050
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:10,545
I was just making
conversation here.

1051
00:49:10,612 --> 00:49:13,414
That's what that was.

1052
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:18,219
Yeah, just drive.

1053
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:21,956
<i>For the record,</i>
<i>she wanted me to kiss her.</i>

1054
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:23,658
<i>So, anyway, we keep going.</i>

1055
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,900
<i>So, as we're getting</i>
<i>to the main roads</i>

1056
00:49:32,968 --> 00:49:35,536
<i>out of the mountains,</i>
<i>I'm getting that itchy feeling,</i>

1057
00:49:35,604 --> 00:49:37,171
<i>an itchy feeling</i>
<i>that just keeps getting worse.</i>

1058
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:47,181
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me.

1059
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:51,285
Hey.

1060
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:52,687
Uh, okay.
This is not good.

1061
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:54,122
No, no.
This is just rain.

1062
00:49:54,189 --> 00:49:55,923
Okay? It doesn't take much
to start a rock slide.

1063
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:58,426
You always see fallen rocks
and trees in the road.

1064
00:49:58,494 --> 00:50:00,061
Yeah, well, I don't see
a lot of trees or rocks.

1065
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:03,364
I just see this tree here

1066
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:06,100
right in the middle of
a hard-to-defend position.

1067
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:08,002
- A hard-to-def--
- Yeah.

1068
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,370
What do you propose we do?

1069
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:10,972
Back those trucks up
and proceed with caution.

1070
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,673
Oscar can clear it.

1071
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:13,875
Hold on a second, okay?

1072
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:16,043
I don't think that thing
fell by itself.

1073
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:17,845
The sooner we cut the tree,
the sooner we can go.

1074
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,115
It's fine. It's fine.

1075
00:50:27,656 --> 00:50:30,725
<i>So, while they're clearing</i>
<i>this tree from the road,</i>

1076
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:32,727
<i>I'm getting a real bad feeling,</i>

1077
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:35,997
<i>one of those "too quiet,</i>
<i>I don't like this place,</i>

1078
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:38,900
<i>something weird is going on"</i>
<i>feelings.</i>

1079
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:41,736
You, uh...
You might want to stay here.

1080
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:48,809
<i>Now, I know, of course,</i>

1081
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:51,345
<i>that there's a fine line</i>
<i>between caution and paranoia.</i>

1082
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:53,247
<i>People tell you about</i>
<i>gut feelings all the time.</i>

1083
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:55,082
<i>But if you follow</i>
<i>every gut feeling,</i>

1084
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,684
<i>you never get anything done.</i>

1085
00:50:56,752 --> 00:51:01,923
<i>Still, sometimes something</i>
<i>feels funny for a reason.</i>

1086
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:09,830
They know we're here.
What?

1087
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:12,133
They know we're here!
Prevent defense!

1088
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:13,534
Aah!

1089
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:19,006
No!

1090
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:25,613
Aah!

1091
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:30,851
Luis!

1092
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:41,495
- Hey, help me with something.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?

1093
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:43,364
Look, those guys
are just scouts, okay?

1094
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:46,067
They're trying to keep us here
until reinforcements show up.

1095
00:51:46,134 --> 00:51:48,502
So we got to block that
switchback down there before --

1096
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,072
well, before <i>that.</i>

1097
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:53,574
Yeah, here they are,
right on time. Come on.

1098
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:09,790
Push! Push!

1099
00:52:16,832 --> 00:52:18,899
Push now! <i>Ivamonos!</i>

1100
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:21,802
Aah!

1101
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:37,118
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

1102
00:52:37,185 --> 00:52:40,288
Very groovy! Come on, guys!

1103
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:43,491
Okay, go, go, go.
We got to go. Got to go.

1104
00:52:55,058 --> 00:52:57,548
Now listen everybody.
We got lucky back there.

1105
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,105
Those guys got excited, and
they made a lot of mistakes,

1106
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:01,607
but it's not gonna
happen again.

1107
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,913
So we got to move,
and we got to move fast.

1108
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,050
Now, if this map
is not garbage,

1109
00:53:12,118 --> 00:53:14,052
we are close
to a CIA outpost.

1110
00:53:16,523 --> 00:53:18,857
We can get there by nightfall
if we hurry.

1111
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:24,930
Understand, señor?
All right, let's go.

1112
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:30,002
Can we talk?

1113
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,937
Ah, listen, you know,
about before, it's --

1114
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:33,172
Oh,
you're talking about --

1115
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,007
No, I'm not talking
about that, actually.

1116
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:36,475
If you want to
embarrass yourself

1117
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:38,210
with your fantasies,
knock yourself out.

1118
00:53:38,278 --> 00:53:39,344
What I want to know is...

1119
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,313
Once we get there,
what happens?

1120
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:42,507
Well, maybe you haven't
been paying attention.

1121
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:43,713
We get there, we get help.

1122
00:53:43,716 --> 00:53:45,384
Oh, so it's as simple
as that.

1123
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:47,186
Who said it was
gonna be simple?

1124
00:53:51,524 --> 00:53:53,358
<i>So, we used</i>
<i>what head start we had,</i>

1125
00:53:53,426 --> 00:53:55,460
<i>but it was pretty slowgoing.</i>

1126
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:57,129
<i>In those mountains,</i>
<i>the good roads are bad,</i>

1127
00:53:57,197 --> 00:54:00,966
<i>and the bad roads, well,</i>
<i>they aren't really even roads.</i>

1128
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:02,334
This is ridiculous.

1129
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:04,369
I can't even tell which way
north is anymore.

1130
00:54:04,437 --> 00:54:05,871
You're sure that it's here?

1131
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:07,639
- Yeah, it's around here somewhere, yeah.
- Really?

1132
00:54:07,707 --> 00:54:10,242
Because there's nothing
on this map that says --

1133
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,711
we are looking for a secret
intelligence facility.

1134
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:13,979
They don't put them
on maps.

1135
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:15,380
That's how you know
they're secret.

1136
00:54:15,448 --> 00:54:16,848
Right, right,
right, right, right.

1137
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:18,450
But isn't it possible
that this guy

1138
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:19,985
that told you about it
is wrong?

1139
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:22,054
- Because honestly --
- Okay, there it is. Right there.

1140
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,024
Now, you want to check it out,
or should we just

1141
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:28,794
chalk this up to my imagination
and go home?

1142
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:32,364
But do -- do we just knock,
or is...?

1143
00:54:32,432 --> 00:54:33,198
<i>Now</i> you want to kiss me.

1144
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:38,770
This isn't some kind of joke,
is it?

1145
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:39,972
I don't joke
about mass murder.

1146
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,473
It's kind of
a touchy subject with me.

1147
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,575
So, guys, what can we do, here?
You got any weapons?

1148
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:44,876
We got a couple .45s
and a --

1149
00:54:44,944 --> 00:54:46,411
you know,
and, like, a box of ammo.

1150
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,680
Other than that, we've got,
like, a lot of computers.

1151
00:54:48,748 --> 00:54:51,116
We got maps.
DVDs. Some good movies.

1152
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:52,884
We're an observation outpost.
Observing.

1153
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:55,420
Yeah, doing
communications support and...

1154
00:54:55,488 --> 00:54:57,522
Not wearing night goggles
going on raids.

1155
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,424
We're not a fortress.

1156
00:54:59,492 --> 00:55:01,460
Okay, what about all the antennas
on the roof? Can you call out?

1157
00:55:01,527 --> 00:55:02,928
Yeah, yeah.
We can do that.

1158
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:04,263
Well, get on it, then.
We need help right now.

1159
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:07,165
What you got, medicine-wise?

1160
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:09,668
Yeah, we'd call that
"not much."

1161
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:11,803
Okay, hold on, now.
It's better than nothing.

1162
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,172
I told you, man.
It's just us out here.

1163
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,441
I mean, its me, Gabe,
and the donkey.

1164
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:18,410
Donkey?
The burro.

1165
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:20,379
We take her into town
for supplies and water,

1166
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:22,614
but, you know, the roads around here...
Yeah, tell me about it.

1167
00:55:22,682 --> 00:55:24,182
This expired,
like, two years ago.

1168
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,651
What's up?

1169
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:27,619
I called in to the military base
in Santa Marta.

1170
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:29,221
And?
Are they sending anybody?

1171
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:30,489
They said they need to see you,
in person, and talk to them.

1172
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:32,658
They said the base chief
needs to meet with you.

1173
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:36,295
I guess there's some confusion
about your, uh, situation.

1174
00:55:36,362 --> 00:55:37,996
Okay, well, how the hell
am I supposed to

1175
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:39,464
get to Santa Marta --
on the burro?

1176
00:55:39,532 --> 00:55:41,099
On the chopper.
It's out back.

1177
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,135
The chopper.
Why didn't you say so?

1178
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:44,569
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

1179
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:50,375
So, you really have to go?
You can't just call them?

1180
00:55:50,443 --> 00:55:52,044
No, they got reports
that I was kidnapped,

1181
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:53,645
that I was killed,
that I've gone rogue.

1182
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:55,580
So I-I got to go out there
and drag them back myself.

1183
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:57,115
Who will you bring?

1184
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,717
Well, the Colombian military's
been working

1185
00:55:58,785 --> 00:56:00,152
with the U.S.
on some anti-drug runs,

1186
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:01,820
so they got attack copters,
troops.

1187
00:56:01,888 --> 00:56:03,555
Veracruz will find
this place soon.

1188
00:56:03,623 --> 00:56:04,790
Yeah. Probably sooner
rather than later.

1189
00:56:04,857 --> 00:56:06,358
That's why
we got to hustle.

1190
00:56:06,426 --> 00:56:08,226
Okay. Let come.
That is out of the question.

1191
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:11,196
We're overweight as it is.

1192
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:13,632
We should go.

1193
00:56:15,535 --> 00:56:18,804
Listen, kid.
I'm coming back, okay?

1194
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:19,905
I'm not gonna
let you guys down.

1195
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:25,444
Okay, so, how well do you know
these Colombian military folks?

1196
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,079
I've done some joint operations
with them.

1197
00:56:27,146 --> 00:56:29,548
Well, 'cause I was thinking if
they can run this up the ladder,

1198
00:56:29,615 --> 00:56:31,383
it'd be good to get
some embassy involvement,

1199
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:33,118
maybe arrange visas
for some of these folks.

1200
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:35,120
We can call Washington.
There's a refugee program

1201
00:56:35,188 --> 00:56:36,788
we might be able to get them into.
Sounds good.

1202
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:48,033
Here we go.

1203
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:10,856
- Hey, guys, how long is this gonna take?
- Hard to say.

1204
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:13,825
As soon as we land, we'll find
the foreign affairs officer,

1205
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:15,527
get the ball rolling
on paperwork.

1206
00:57:15,595 --> 00:57:17,295
Paperwork?
Yeah, for going back.

1207
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:19,297
You know the drill --
authorization reports...

1208
00:57:19,365 --> 00:57:20,899
...Duty orders.
...Debriefing reports.

1209
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:22,567
Hang on a second.
You guys didn't mention

1210
00:57:22,635 --> 00:57:24,836
anything about paperwork
when we were down on the ground.

1211
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,339
What are you talking about?
It's protocol, man.

1212
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:30,142
The CIA's not gonna send out
a military tactical team

1213
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:31,543
without checking it out.

1214
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:33,879
Why they hell didn't you
mention that back there?

1215
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:35,447
And, uh, what,
cause a riot?

1216
00:57:35,515 --> 00:57:38,316
Hey, we got rules to follow,
like anybody else, pal.

1217
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:40,385
Those rules
are also pretty clear --

1218
00:57:40,453 --> 00:57:42,287
when a facility's
been compromised,

1219
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:44,689
you take the classified
material and bug out

1220
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:46,525
without causing an
international incident.

1221
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:48,560
Keyword there
would be "without."

1222
00:57:48,628 --> 00:57:50,228
I thought you were on board
with all this,

1223
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:51,797
especially with
all that embassy talk.

1224
00:57:51,864 --> 00:57:53,598
Visas.

1225
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:56,334
Guys, you promised
those people down there.

1226
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:58,270
- <i>I</i> promised those people.
- Grow up, man.

1227
00:57:58,337 --> 00:58:00,272
No way we could have
ever given them

1228
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:02,240
anything near
what you promised them.

1229
00:58:02,308 --> 00:58:04,810
Not unless U.S. personnel
were under direct attack.

1230
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:06,378
<i>There's a point</i>
<i>in a soldier's life</i>

1231
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:08,346
<i>where he's got to decide</i>
<i>whether he's gonna follow</i>

1232
00:58:08,414 --> 00:58:11,082
<i>the letter or the spirit</i>
<i>of his orders.</i>

1233
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,818
So you can't do anything
unless Americans

1234
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:14,186
are under direct attack,
right?

1235
00:58:14,253 --> 00:58:15,720
That's right.

1236
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:17,222
What about you guys?
Do you count?

1237
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,291
Land the chopper. Now.

1238
00:58:25,264 --> 00:58:28,733
You held two
CIA officers hostage

1239
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,569
on behalf of a suspected
terrorist group?

1240
00:58:32,305 --> 00:58:33,371
That's treason.

1241
00:58:33,439 --> 00:58:35,106
Do you think I wanted to?

1242
00:58:35,174 --> 00:58:36,775
Do you think
I had a choice?

1243
00:58:36,843 --> 00:58:38,443
Sir, we were
not gonna get help

1244
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:41,213
unless those guys told the brass
that they were under attack.

1245
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,914
I did what I had to do.

1246
00:58:42,982 --> 00:58:44,216
I see.
You had to kidnap them.

1247
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:45,484
"Kidnap." Get out of here.

1248
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:46,918
I was just helping them
do the right thing.

1249
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:49,154
Helping them.
With a .45-caliber pistol?

1250
00:58:49,222 --> 00:58:50,722
Well, you know
what they say, sir.

1251
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:53,325
Guns don't help people.
<i>People</i> help people.

1252
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:55,527
You are in a world of hurt,
soldier.

1253
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,373
Commander Axe,

1254
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:06,179
as we reconvene
this inquiry,

1255
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:07,874
I am obliged to ask you

1256
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:11,111
if you would like us to
assign you a military lawyer.

1257
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:12,579
- A lawyer?
- I'd advise it.

1258
00:59:12,647 --> 00:59:14,881
I thought I was just
making a report here.

1259
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,249
Oh, we've gone beyond that,
Commander.

1260
00:59:16,317 --> 00:59:19,119
Now, we've detained and
questioned a few of the people

1261
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:22,189
that were involved
in your little adventure,

1262
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:24,424
and there's quite a case
building against you.

1263
00:59:24,492 --> 00:59:26,493
Wait, wait.
You're rounding people up?

1264
00:59:26,561 --> 00:59:29,029
Yes, the farmers, the doctor,
Amanda Maples.

1265
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:31,765
Those are my friends, sir.
They didn't do anything wrong.

1266
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,700
It's standard operating
procedure, Commander.

1267
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:36,236
"Standard operating procedure."
Why don't you bite me?

1268
00:59:36,304 --> 00:59:37,838
You're speaking
to a superior officer!

1269
00:59:37,905 --> 00:59:39,673
<i>You're</i> speaking
to a superior officer!

1270
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:41,074
Stand down, Commander!

1271
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:44,911
Now, you've underestimated
the sheer size of this fiasco.

1272
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:46,580
And by all accounts,
you are standing

1273
00:59:46,647 --> 00:59:48,215
in the middle of it,
dead center.

1274
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:49,449
So, last chance --
do you want to

1275
00:59:49,517 --> 00:59:51,118
exercise your right
to legal counsel?

1276
00:59:51,185 --> 00:59:53,787
I'm good.

1277
00:59:53,855 --> 00:59:55,889
You know what these proceedings
could result in.

1278
00:59:55,957 --> 00:59:57,624
Yeah, me getting thrown into a
hole for the rest of my life?

1279
00:59:57,692 --> 00:59:58,959
Yeah, I got it.

1280
00:59:59,027 --> 01:00:00,293
I also know that a lawyer

1281
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:02,195
is not gonna make
a damn bit of difference.

1282
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:04,531
Now, sir, you want to hang
this mess around my neck,

1283
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:06,400
you go for it,
but leave my friends alone.

1284
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:09,136
You're in no position
to negotiate, Commander Axe.

1285
01:00:09,203 --> 01:00:11,705
Now I want to hear
about what happened

1286
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:15,208
after you drew your weapon
on two CIA field agents.

1287
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:17,310
All right. Fine.

1288
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:20,113
After my "conversation"
with the CIA boys,

1289
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:21,481
we went back
to the outpost.

1290
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:23,316
And let me tell you
something, sir --

1291
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:25,052
everybody was real glad
to see me.

1292
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,653
- Change of plans.
- That was quick.

1293
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:28,467
You do know that the town
is the other way?

1294
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:30,155
I thought you were going
to get help.

1295
01:00:30,223 --> 01:00:32,658
- Yeah, there was a little hitch.
- What kind of a hitch?

1296
01:00:32,726 --> 01:00:33,859
Turns out
our CIA buddies

1297
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:35,461
were not such good buddies
after all.

1298
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:37,596
They were planning on leaving
everybody to the wolves.

1299
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:39,164
I disagreed
with that plan.

1300
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:42,034
What --
and they are...?

1301
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:43,502
Tied up
in the helicopter.

1302
01:00:45,272 --> 01:00:47,339
Oh, that is not good.

1303
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:49,575
Okay, so, um, now what
are we supposed to do?

1304
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:51,043
Aren't you the one who said

1305
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,611
that we were going to
get slaughtered?

1306
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:55,014
That's not gonna happen.

1307
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:56,548
So you have a plan?

1308
01:00:56,616 --> 01:01:00,920
Uh, no, but I know
where to start.

1309
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:06,659
Make the call.
I'm not calling in.

1310
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:07,960
Do it.
You'll thank me later.

1311
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:09,695
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we won't thank you.

1312
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:11,897
Yeah, you will. Because Veracruz
is following our trail here.

1313
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,499
And when he does,
he's gonna wipe this place

1314
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:16,802
off the face of the earth,
and you two yahoos with it.

1315
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:19,104
What do you want?

1316
01:01:19,172 --> 01:01:21,040
I want you to call
your CIA buddies,

1317
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:23,042
tell them to get the
Colombian military out here,

1318
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:24,977
the national police -- the
works, everything they got.

1319
01:01:25,045 --> 01:01:26,278
You're gonna burn for this.

1320
01:01:26,346 --> 01:01:27,646
Yeah, but that's
not the question.

1321
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,581
The question is whether
you're gonna make that call...

1322
01:01:29,649 --> 01:01:31,717
Or if I'm gonna have to
make you make the call.

1323
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:42,695
Yeah, it's Gabriel Manaro
out at station 412.

1324
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:44,163
We got a situation here.

1325
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:46,832
Some kind of rogue military
force is attacking our position.

1326
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:50,703
Just helping you sell it.

1327
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,304
Yeah, yeah, that's --

1328
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:55,207
we're firing back at them.
We need supp--

1329
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:56,976
be more convincing.

1330
01:01:57,043 --> 01:01:59,044
Jesus! No.
No, I'm not talking to you.

1331
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,581
We need help!
We need support now!

1332
01:02:02,649 --> 01:02:04,917
Send it! Send the help!
Military support! Now!

1333
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:08,921
Help us!
I am at station 4-1-2!

1334
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:10,022
Yes! Yes! Just hurry!

1335
01:02:11,224 --> 01:02:13,425
They'll have a team here
in three hours.

1336
01:02:13,493 --> 01:02:15,294
Three hours?
Veracruz is just up the road.

1337
01:02:15,362 --> 01:02:17,096
He's gonna be all over us
in three hours.

1338
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:18,030
Yeah, well, they're coming
from over the mountains.

1339
01:02:18,098 --> 01:02:19,531
That's what it takes,
dude!

1340
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,633
That's the fastest they can
get here. It's not magic.

1341
01:02:21,701 --> 01:02:23,469
What's going on?
Who's shooting?

1342
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:26,705
- That was me just making a point.
- Okay, what?

1343
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:27,906
Well, I got good news
and bad news.

1344
01:02:27,974 --> 01:02:29,408
Good news is,
help is on the way.

1345
01:02:29,476 --> 01:02:32,378
Bad news is, we're gonna have to
hold out until it gets here.

1346
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:33,712
Okay, señors.

1347
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:41,453
Hey, look what I made.

1348
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:43,622
That's a hell of a bomb.
Wow. You got a gift.

1349
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,958
Well, you know, I've been
doing field medicine

1350
01:02:46,026 --> 01:02:47,726
for a long time.
You learn to improvise.

1351
01:02:47,794 --> 01:02:49,228
Yeah, well, I've known
a lot of field medics,

1352
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:50,763
but they don't have your chops
with explosives.

1353
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,865
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1354
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,099
Where's the kid?

1355
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,508
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

1356
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:03,842
What?

1357
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,277
You know, this, um --

1358
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:08,280
this fight with Veracruz,
it's gonna be rough.

1359
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:09,982
We got to hold them off
for a long time.

1360
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:11,450
So I was thinking
it would be a good idea

1361
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:14,119
if you just stay back here
and watch the CIA guys.

1362
01:03:14,187 --> 01:03:16,155
Stay here?
I'm fighting with the others.

1363
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:19,158
Okay, okay.
Just hear me out here.

1364
01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:21,760
Now, you're still young, and
you've done more in this fight

1365
01:03:21,828 --> 01:03:23,462
than any kid
should ever have to.

1366
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:26,365
Those men
killed my father.

1367
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:29,368
I think it's safe to say
if your dad was here,

1368
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:31,170
he wouldn't want you
catching a bullet.

1369
01:03:31,237 --> 01:03:33,072
I mean, think about it.
What would he say?

1370
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:37,342
I don't know.
He's not here.

1371
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:41,980
He would say a kid as tough
and as smart as you

1372
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,149
is gonna have
a big future.

1373
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:45,951
He'd want you to grow up
and see it, wouldn't he?

1374
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:49,121
He would want me to stay.

1375
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:52,224
So you'll stay?

1376
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:56,328
No.
But thanks anyways.

1377
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:58,197
You remind me
of my father.

1378
01:03:58,264 --> 01:04:00,833
And I didn't listen
to him, either.

1379
01:04:03,603 --> 01:04:05,404
Kids these days.

1380
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:07,573
All right, mount up!

1381
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,741
<i>We did a little recon</i>
<i>when we got out to the road</i>

1382
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:12,010
<i>and we got some more bad news.</i>

1383
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:14,480
<i>Veracruz's buddy Perez</i>
<i>showed up,</i>

1384
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:15,981
<i>and he brought more guys</i>
<i>with him --</i>

1385
01:04:16,049 --> 01:04:18,650
<i>a lot more guys,</i>
<i>with a lot more guns.</i>

1386
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:41,073
<i>Still, there wasn't much to do</i>
<i>but stick with the plan.</i>

1387
01:04:41,141 --> 01:04:44,843
<i>We had our little explosive</i>
<i>device cobbled together</i>

1388
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:46,879
<i>from some C-4 charges</i>
<i>the CIA guys had</i>

1389
01:04:46,946 --> 01:04:49,014
<i>in case they needed to blow up</i>
<i>their computers in a hurry.</i>

1390
01:04:51,784 --> 01:04:53,519
<i>The way I figured it,</i>

1391
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:55,087
<i>if we could plant it</i>
<i>at the right spot,</i>

1392
01:04:55,155 --> 01:04:57,322
<i>we could block the road</i>
<i>with a couple thousand pounds</i>

1393
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:58,957
<i>of burning truck wreckage</i>

1394
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:01,360
<i>then pin Veracruz down</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

1395
01:05:03,196 --> 01:05:04,530
You should probably go.

1396
01:05:04,597 --> 01:05:08,000
No. No. Do it.

1397
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:11,770
<i>That is, assuming we didn't</i>
<i>blow ourselves up first.</i>

1398
01:05:16,075 --> 01:05:18,710
Okay. Let's go.

1399
01:05:18,778 --> 01:05:21,880
I know we were not expecting
the reinforcements.

1400
01:05:24,217 --> 01:05:28,053
And the odds are, um,
kind of against us.

1401
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:33,625
But what the hell?
You're the flaming sword, right?

1402
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,865
Now, look, they got to
come from down there.

1403
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:42,768
When that bomb blows,

1404
01:05:42,835 --> 01:05:44,570
it's gonna be our job
to slow them down.

1405
01:05:47,373 --> 01:05:49,575
'Cause if they get through here -- pbht! --
We are sitting ducks.

1406
01:05:49,642 --> 01:05:52,177
Pbht!

1407
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:53,879
Sitting ducks?

1408
01:05:53,947 --> 01:05:55,314
It's an expression.

1409
01:05:55,381 --> 01:05:59,585
It's like ducks in a pond,
ducks in a row. It's easy to --

1410
01:06:10,496 --> 01:06:12,531
How bad is this?

1411
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:14,233
Oh, well, maybe we had
a solid chance

1412
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,901
before that troop transport
showed up.

1413
01:06:15,969 --> 01:06:17,502
But now...

1414
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,605
And how long do we
have to hold them?

1415
01:06:19,672 --> 01:06:22,140
Help comes
in about two hours.

1416
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:23,675
Veracruz and his men,
give or take 90 minutes,

1417
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:26,111
so I think we got to hold out
for about a half-hour.

1418
01:06:26,179 --> 01:06:27,746
Can we do that?

1419
01:06:27,814 --> 01:06:29,214
Well, with the terrain
on our side, maybe.

1420
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:32,818
But it's gonna be
a long half-hour.

1421
01:06:32,885 --> 01:06:34,653
But, hey, it could be worse,
right?

1422
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:37,756
It could be raining.
Let's do this.

1423
01:06:37,824 --> 01:06:41,593
<i>Now, at this point, we didn't</i>
<i>have a whole lot going for us.</i>

1424
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:42,961
<i>On our side,</i>
<i>we had the high ground</i>

1425
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:44,563
<i>and the element of surprise.</i>

1426
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:48,066
<i>On their side,</i>
<i>they had manpower,</i>

1427
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:50,402
<i>equipment, body armor,</i>
<i>superior weaponry,</i>

1428
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,638
<i>radio communications, and</i>
<i>pretty much everything else.</i>

1429
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:12,424
Is he on it, or is he not on?

1430
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,028
He's not on it.
If he was on it, it would --

1431
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:20,866
Luis, now!

1432
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:31,009
Ha! Flaming sword!

1433
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,945
Damn right.
Flaming sword! Attack!

1434
01:07:34,013 --> 01:07:35,347
Zone blitz!

1435
01:07:35,415 --> 01:07:36,548
Zone blitz!

1436
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:59,938
Good shot, Mondo.

1437
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:29,434
The men are running
out of ammunition.

1438
01:08:29,502 --> 01:08:31,002
Tell them to act like
they're shooting.

1439
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,938
Just keep looking mean, pretend
like they have ammunition.

1440
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:34,306
What?!

1441
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:35,507
Just do it!

1442
01:08:41,114 --> 01:08:43,749
<i>I pulled out every trick</i>
<i>in the book.</i>

1443
01:08:43,816 --> 01:08:45,884
<i>But the thing is,</i>
<i>at the end of the day,</i>

1444
01:08:45,952 --> 01:08:49,154
<i>there's just no good substitute</i>
<i>for bullets.</i>

1445
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,185
No!

1446
01:09:21,621 --> 01:09:24,523
Okay, uh, I don't think
they're buying it.

1447
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:25,724
All right, look,
game over.

1448
01:09:25,792 --> 01:09:27,392
Tell them to fall back
to the trucks.

1449
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,434
Old man! Let's go!

1450
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:39,304
No.

1451
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:54,286
Wait.
W-what is he doing?

1452
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:56,788
He's covering us.

1453
01:09:56,856 --> 01:09:59,291
Let's go. Let's go.

1454
01:10:09,035 --> 01:10:10,168
Espada Ardiente!

1455
01:10:13,806 --> 01:10:15,774
I got to go back.
Ben.

1456
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,843
I got one more charge,
just in case.

1457
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:18,844
We got to get him.

1458
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:33,358
Aren't you
full of surprises.

1459
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:44,369
Oh, Jesus.
He's dead.

1460
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:50,242
Are you okay?
No! I'm shot!

1461
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:51,877
That's right.
Stupid question. Okay.

1462
01:10:51,944 --> 01:10:54,379
Let's do it.

1463
01:11:17,385 --> 01:11:19,853
Get him inside.

1464
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,822
Damn it.
Where the hell are they?

1465
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:32,565
Beatriz, they're coming.
Let's get inside.

1466
01:11:32,633 --> 01:11:35,001
Get off me!
Don't! Please, kid. I'm begging you.

1467
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:37,103
They killed Luis,
and I'm going to fight them!

1468
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:39,873
Look, I know that he meant
a lot to you, okay?

1469
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,575
But he was a soldier.
He was protecting you.

1470
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:44,711
Don't make his death
meaningless

1471
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:46,579
by standing out here
and getting yourself killed.

1472
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:48,415
Please, if you won't
go inside for me,

1473
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:49,883
at least do it
for the old goat herder.

1474
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,688
Where the hell are they?
Call 'em again.

1475
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:01,294
How much longer?

1476
01:12:01,362 --> 01:12:03,329
'Ca-- 'cause we're
running out of time up here.

1477
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:05,331
It's -- the situation
is getting urgent --

1478
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:06,866
Yeah, is this
the station chief?

1479
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:09,069
I got to know how much longer
this is gonna take,

1480
01:12:09,136 --> 01:12:10,970
and your numbnuts officer here
can't tell me.

1481
01:12:11,038 --> 01:12:12,238
Who is this?

1482
01:12:12,306 --> 01:12:15,975
Who is this?
Who is this?!

1483
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:17,777
Deputy assistant intelligence
director Chuck Finley.

1484
01:12:17,845 --> 01:12:19,079
That's who.

1485
01:12:19,146 --> 01:12:20,780
I'm down
from NSA headquarters here

1486
01:12:20,848 --> 01:12:22,215
doing a random sigint check,

1487
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:24,517
and I ran into this little
disaster area of yours.

1488
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:25,885
Now, where are these troops?

1489
01:12:25,953 --> 01:12:27,620
They're 10 minutes away,
sir.

1490
01:12:27,688 --> 01:12:29,689
10 minutes?
This thing will be over in 5.

1491
01:12:29,757 --> 01:12:30,890
Get on it.

1492
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:33,693
Chuck Finley?

1493
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:35,662
Yeah. Made a lot of money
betting on him back in the day.

1494
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:38,731
I'm thinking
it's a lucky name.

1495
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:39,899
I guess we'll find out.

1496
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:44,037
<i>Between the flipped truck</i>
<i>and the firefight,</i>

1497
01:12:44,105 --> 01:12:45,705
<i>we bought ourselves some time.</i>

1498
01:12:45,773 --> 01:12:48,374
<i>But it wasn't too long before</i>
<i>Veracruz was in position,</i>

1499
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:50,443
<i>and we were</i>
<i>about to get creamed.</i>

1500
01:12:52,012 --> 01:12:53,146
Keep everybody inside.

1501
01:12:53,214 --> 01:12:54,614
When the shooting starts,

1502
01:12:54,682 --> 01:12:57,450
make sure they're away from
the windows and down low, okay?

1503
01:13:20,975 --> 01:13:22,742
I'm going out there.

1504
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:25,311
You're what?

1505
01:13:25,379 --> 01:13:26,679
I got to buy us
some more time.

1506
01:13:26,747 --> 01:13:29,449
Sam, if you go out there,
Veracruz will kill you.

1507
01:13:29,517 --> 01:13:30,750
Yeah. Maybe.

1508
01:13:30,818 --> 01:13:32,552
But if I manage to die slowly,
that'll put you guys

1509
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:34,220
just a little closer
to getting out of here.

1510
01:13:34,288 --> 01:13:36,589
No, no, no. You're at least
taking your gun.

1511
01:13:36,657 --> 01:13:39,859
If he sees that I have a gun,
he's gonna shoot me on sight.

1512
01:13:39,927 --> 01:13:41,427
Don't worry about it.
I got an idea.

1513
01:13:41,495 --> 01:13:42,795
No, no. Wait.

1514
01:13:42,863 --> 01:13:45,598
I mean, they --
you can't --

1515
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,600
ju-- if you just --

1516
01:13:47,668 --> 01:13:50,303
stay alive.

1517
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:51,471
I'll do my best.

1518
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:53,973
Still, you know,
if we were gonna kiss,

1519
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:56,509
we should probably do it now
just in case.

1520
01:13:56,577 --> 01:13:59,612
I don't want to...

1521
01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:08,955
That is a lot better
than a kick in the teeth.

1522
01:14:58,105 --> 01:15:00,807
Whoa. Whoa.

1523
01:15:02,776 --> 01:15:04,077
Hey, guys,
we need to talk.

1524
01:15:04,144 --> 01:15:06,412
What is there to talk about,
Commander Axe?

1525
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,147
Oh, we got a lot
to talk about.

1526
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:10,516
I'm here to negotiate
the terms of your surrender.

1527
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,054
Our surrender?
Is that supposed to be funny?

1528
01:15:25,966 --> 01:15:27,233
How long
before they get here?

1529
01:15:27,301 --> 01:15:29,769
I don't know. Soon.

1530
01:15:29,837 --> 01:15:32,505
They better get here
soon.

1531
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:38,911
Man, you just love doing that,
don't you?

1532
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:40,747
How many are there
inside?

1533
01:15:40,814 --> 01:15:44,917
Believe me, y-you don't know
what you're up against.

1534
01:15:44,985 --> 01:15:45,852
Yes, "Espada Ardiente."
We know.

1535
01:15:45,919 --> 01:15:48,021
No. No.

1536
01:15:48,088 --> 01:15:49,555
It's the flaming sword.

1537
01:15:49,623 --> 01:15:52,225
Believe me, you don't want to
mess with them.

1538
01:15:52,293 --> 01:15:53,426
And why is that?

1539
01:15:53,494 --> 01:15:55,094
'Cause I've fought
all over --

1540
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:57,196
Afghanistan, the Balkans,
Southeast Asia.

1541
01:15:57,264 --> 01:15:58,898
I've never seen guys
like this.

1542
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:00,700
I count a dozen men
with old rifle--

1543
01:16:00,768 --> 01:16:02,902
farmers,
by the look of them.

1544
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:05,605
Yeah? You think
that's all we got?

1545
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:07,473
Then what am I
doing here?

1546
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,108
I'm a commander
in the Navy S.E.A.L.S.

1547
01:16:09,176 --> 01:16:10,576
You think
I'm gonna be wasting time

1548
01:16:10,644 --> 01:16:12,111
with a bunch
of smelly farmers --

1549
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:14,981
smelly, stinking,
unwashed farmers?

1550
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:16,549
No, no.

1551
01:16:16,617 --> 01:16:18,885
You boys have made
a grave miscalculation.

1552
01:16:18,952 --> 01:16:21,321
That's why I'm here
with my one-time-only,

1553
01:16:21,388 --> 01:16:22,722
not-to-be-repeated
offer --

1554
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:25,325
unconditional surrender
right now,

1555
01:16:25,392 --> 01:16:26,959
and I'll let you
walk away.

1556
01:16:29,863 --> 01:16:31,064
You're bluffing.

1557
01:16:32,366 --> 01:16:33,466
What is he doing?

1558
01:16:34,735 --> 01:16:36,336
No!

1559
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:39,572
Ohh.

1560
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,240
All right, all right.

1561
01:16:41,308 --> 01:16:43,810
Because I am feeling...

1562
01:16:43,877 --> 01:16:48,648
Generous and, uh,
merciful...

1563
01:16:48,716 --> 01:16:50,783
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

1564
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:55,054
Surrender right now.
Okay? I'm serious.

1565
01:16:57,725 --> 01:16:58,925
What is he doing?!

1566
01:17:04,498 --> 01:17:05,932
I'm telling you guys,

1567
01:17:05,999 --> 01:17:08,601
you're just making it worse
on yourself.

1568
01:17:08,669 --> 01:17:10,203
Ugh, we should finish him.
Wait!

1569
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:13,573
Let's see this flaming sword,
shall we?

1570
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,075
I'm telling you guys,
you're gonna regret it.

1571
01:17:20,914 --> 01:17:22,081
Aah!

1572
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:23,383
<i>I've heard the old saying</i>

1573
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:25,017
<i>about soldiers</i>
<i>praying in foxholes.</i>

1574
01:17:25,085 --> 01:17:27,520
<i>It's a natural response</i>
<i>when your friends are dying</i>

1575
01:17:27,588 --> 01:17:30,690
<i>and everything you care about</i>
<i>is about to get destroyed.</i>

1576
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:33,025
<i>But I got to say,</i>
<i>in my experience,</i>

1577
01:17:33,093 --> 01:17:35,528
<i>prayer is pretty iffy</i>
<i>as a battle plan.</i>

1578
01:17:35,596 --> 01:17:39,432
Aah!

1579
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:43,870
<i>But I'll also say this --</i>

1580
01:17:43,937 --> 01:17:45,838
<i>when you need a miracle,</i>
<i>there's nothing like it.</i>

1581
01:18:02,222 --> 01:18:08,027
Hey, guys.
Say hello to my friends.

1582
01:18:08,095 --> 01:18:10,763
I call them the newest members
of the flaming sword,

1583
01:18:10,831 --> 01:18:12,698
you crooked son of a bitch.

1584
01:18:41,962 --> 01:18:44,230
Sam -- Sam Axe.

1585
01:18:44,298 --> 01:18:46,265
The good guys --
it's the good guy--

1586
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,801
uh, <i>Los buenos.</i>
<i>Los buenos.</i>

1587
01:18:57,511 --> 01:18:59,745
So, you guys ready
to surrender now?

1588
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:02,114
Aah!

1589
01:19:08,121 --> 01:19:10,323
Man, that felt good.

1590
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:12,124
Sam Axe!

1591
01:19:40,721 --> 01:19:42,021
So, you gonna make it?

1592
01:19:42,089 --> 01:19:43,356
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

1593
01:19:43,423 --> 01:19:44,657
Well, I got to say,

1594
01:19:44,725 --> 01:19:46,993
if you ever reconsider
the whole medical thing,

1595
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,028
you'd make a hell
of a soldier.

1596
01:19:49,096 --> 01:19:50,596
Okay.

1597
01:19:50,664 --> 01:19:52,598
All right, I will -- I will,
uh -- I'll keep that in mind.

1598
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:54,667
Listen, Sam...

1599
01:19:54,735 --> 01:19:56,736
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1600
01:19:56,803 --> 01:19:58,037
Back at you, doc.

1601
01:19:58,105 --> 01:20:00,573
All right.

1602
01:20:00,641 --> 01:20:01,774
Help this man up.

1603
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:08,247
So, what happens now?

1604
01:20:08,315 --> 01:20:10,416
Well, it's gonna take a while
to sort this all out.

1605
01:20:10,484 --> 01:20:12,084
My guess
is that Veracruz and Perez

1606
01:20:12,152 --> 01:20:15,254
are gonna be going off the grid
for their foreseeable lifetimes.

1607
01:20:15,322 --> 01:20:17,123
No, I mean,
what about you?

1608
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:19,825
Oh, I'm probably gonna get spend
some quality time

1609
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:21,827
at the nearest
covert military facility.

1610
01:20:25,065 --> 01:20:26,966
Well, uh, good luck.

1611
01:20:27,034 --> 01:20:29,068
Thanks.

1612
01:20:29,136 --> 01:20:31,871
And, uh...
Thanks for the kiss, huh?

1613
01:20:31,939 --> 01:20:34,507
I mean, I know
you probably only did it

1614
01:20:34,575 --> 01:20:36,312
'cause you thought
I was gonna die, but --

1615
01:20:36,313 --> 01:20:37,513
Oh, my God.

1616
01:20:43,951 --> 01:20:47,820
Commander Axe...
You need to come with us.

1617
01:20:58,498 --> 01:21:00,232
Señor Axe...

1618
01:21:58,992 --> 01:22:02,495
And here I am.

1619
01:22:02,562 --> 01:22:04,030
That's quite a story,
Commander Axe.

1620
01:22:04,097 --> 01:22:06,699
Thanks.
How does it end, sir?

1621
01:22:06,767 --> 01:22:08,467
There's only one way
it could end --

1622
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:10,136
a court martial.

1623
01:22:10,203 --> 01:22:12,171
Well, sir, there is actually
one more part of the story

1624
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,305
that you should
probably hear.

1625
01:22:13,373 --> 01:22:14,840
I mean, I was saving it

1626
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:16,776
in case you decided to be
a stand-up guy about all this,

1627
01:22:16,843 --> 01:22:18,144
but I guess
that's not gonna happen.

1628
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:19,578
What are you talking
about?

1629
01:22:19,646 --> 01:22:21,647
Do you remember the little chat
I had with Beatriz

1630
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:23,049
after Luis died?

1631
01:22:23,116 --> 01:22:26,318
Well,
there's something I left out.

1632
01:22:26,386 --> 01:22:28,054
He was protecting you.

1633
01:22:28,121 --> 01:22:29,722
Don't make his death
meaningless

1634
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:32,058
by staying outside
and getting yourself killed.

1635
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,193
It's my fault!

1636
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:36,295
It's my fault --
all of this.

1637
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:37,697
<i>Now, the first half</i>
<i>of the discussion</i>

1638
01:22:37,764 --> 01:22:39,298
<i>went just like I told you.</i>

1639
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:40,800
<i>It was in the second half,</i>
<i>though,</i>

1640
01:22:40,867 --> 01:22:42,134
<i>where things got</i>
<i>really interesting.</i>

1641
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:44,437
Kid, don't say that.

1642
01:22:44,504 --> 01:22:46,539
This has nothing to do
with you.

1643
01:22:46,606 --> 01:22:48,340
The flaming sword -- they knew
what they were getting into.

1644
01:22:48,408 --> 01:22:50,009
There's no flaming sword!

1645
01:22:50,077 --> 01:22:51,744
What the hell
are you talking about?

1646
01:22:51,812 --> 01:22:53,713
My father interviewed Luis
for the newspaper,

1647
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:57,149
and I went with him,
so I knew all his story --

1648
01:22:57,217 --> 01:23:00,653
that he was in the army
and he went away to be a farmer.

1649
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:04,857
After my father was killed,
I went back to Luis.

1650
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:08,728
I gave him the name
of "Espada Ardiente,"

1651
01:23:08,795 --> 01:23:10,362
and I convinced him
to fight!

1652
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,031
Wait a minute.

1653
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:17,203
So all of this
was <i>your</i> idea?

1654
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,771
Everything.

1655
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:23,809
I should die here.

1656
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,482
Now, look, kid...

1657
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:30,983
This is not over,

1658
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:32,151
not by a long shot.

1659
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:33,652
Now, we're gonna
get through this.

1660
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,121
And I've been around long enough
to know when this is all over,

1661
01:23:35,188 --> 01:23:37,022
there's gonna be hell
to pay.

1662
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:40,192
You want something to live for?
You want to help your friends?

1663
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,328
'Cause I got a job
for you.

1664
01:23:42,395 --> 01:23:44,430
You any good
with a camera?

1665
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:47,500
So, I figured if anybody
could get away clean

1666
01:23:47,567 --> 01:23:49,335
after that little skirmish,
it was a kid.

1667
01:23:49,402 --> 01:23:50,903
And a kid
with connections

1668
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:52,371
at the largest newspaper
in Colombia?

1669
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:55,207
Well, that could be
mighty handy.

1670
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:59,512
<i>I had her grab one of the</i>
<i>cameras from the CIA outpost</i>

1671
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:02,982
<i>and take pictures --</i>
<i>a lot of them --</i>

1672
01:24:03,049 --> 01:24:04,784
<i>of everyone and everything...</i>

1673
01:24:14,027 --> 01:24:16,262
<i>...Then get herself</i>
<i>down to Bogotá,</i>

1674
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:18,230
<i>and go back to her dad's</i>
<i>old newspaper...</i>

1675
01:24:26,006 --> 01:24:27,807
Beatriz!

1676
01:24:27,874 --> 01:24:30,142
<i>...And once she got there,</i>
<i>to talk to someone she trusted</i>

1677
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,211
<i>about putting together</i>
<i>a couple of stories.</i>

1678
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:42,454
Now, one of these stories
should be in today's paper.

1679
01:24:42,522 --> 01:24:44,390
In fact, sir,
isn't there a piece

1680
01:24:44,457 --> 01:24:46,392
on the front page today
about Luis,

1681
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:49,328
talking about how he died
under mysterious circumstances?

1682
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:53,165
There was. Yes.

1683
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:56,468
Oh, how interesting.

1684
01:24:59,973 --> 01:25:02,675
Why don't we all
take a break?

1685
01:25:02,742 --> 01:25:04,844
Yes, sir.

1686
01:25:11,685 --> 01:25:12,818
You don't really think

1687
01:25:12,886 --> 01:25:14,753
that anyone's gonna take
this girl's word

1688
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:17,089
over that
of the United States military?

1689
01:25:17,157 --> 01:25:19,825
Well, the girl
did have extensive access

1690
01:25:19,893 --> 01:25:21,894
to a covert
CIA outpost, sir.

1691
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:23,996
I mean,
imagine what she saw

1692
01:25:24,064 --> 01:25:26,565
and took pictures of.

1693
01:25:26,633 --> 01:25:28,868
Tell me, what happens when spies
who are under official cover

1694
01:25:28,935 --> 01:25:31,237
get their pictures
in the paper?

1695
01:25:31,304 --> 01:25:32,504
I mean,
that can't be good, right?

1696
01:25:32,572 --> 01:25:33,539
You wouldn't dare.

1697
01:25:33,607 --> 01:25:34,907
This is the sort of thing

1698
01:25:34,975 --> 01:25:37,443
that you don't want revealed
to the world, Admiral,

1699
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:38,744
and it's gonna be --

1700
01:25:38,812 --> 01:25:41,914
things that could end
a guy's military career,

1701
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:43,282
and I'm not
talking about mine.

1702
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,818
What do you want?

1703
01:25:45,886 --> 01:25:47,152
Thanks for asking.

1704
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:49,221
First,
you let my friends go.

1705
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:51,223
Then you rebuild
the clinic.

1706
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:53,959
The flaming sword guys
go back to their goats,

1707
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:55,895
I get
an honorable discharge,

1708
01:25:55,962 --> 01:25:58,230
and we keep our mouths shut
about this forever.

1709
01:25:58,298 --> 01:26:00,566
In the words of my buddy
Mike Westen,

1710
01:26:00,634 --> 01:26:03,202
"this is the kind of secret
that <i>stays</i> a secret."

1711
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:04,570
That's blackmail.

1712
01:26:04,638 --> 01:26:07,840
No. Actually, sir, I believe
this form of extortion

1713
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,775
is known as "graymail."

1714
01:26:09,843 --> 01:26:11,844
It's much nicer
than blackmail.

1715
01:26:15,582 --> 01:26:18,150
I believe
we're done here, sir.

1716
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,891
