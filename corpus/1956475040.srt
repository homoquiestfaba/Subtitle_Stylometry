00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,325
Crime rose in Los Angeles.

3
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:19,277
Violent crime spiked about 20 %
in the nation's second largest city.

4
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:24,478
There have been 280 homicides
in LA, up 10 % from last year.

5
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,077
The number of rapes increased 6.4 %

6
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:29,921
and aggravated assaults are up
more than 27 %.

00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,324
Alf 21 LAPD

8
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,843

some of this year's ctime spike

9
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:56,157
to a resurgence of gang violence this summer.

00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:11,476
How many we lookin' at?

11
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,086
Just the four, maybe five.

39
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:19,483
So, another time we see a moral code
turn into a law is about 2000 BC

40
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,001
during the Mesopotamia Era.

41
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:24,597
During that time, a law was invented
by a man named Hammurabi

42
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,325
and the exact law is what?

43
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,959
"If a man has destroyed the
eye of the man of the gentleman class

44
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,720
they shall destroy his eye."

45
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:33,322
An eye for an eye.

46
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,441
You guys remember that, right?

47
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:36,916
Who doesn't know that one, right?

48
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:41,439
So, what we have to learn, though, is that
ethics is an important part of a system,

49
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,684
Right? We're in a social system,
and we wanna Kinda operate together

50
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,997
with some sort of ethical
and moral boundaries.

51
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,557
That's kinda how justice became what it is

52
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,923
because people operate outside
of that ethical system.

53
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:57,361
When a government cannot exercise
justice any longer, on its group

54
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,406
is when a government gets overthrown.

55
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,278
So, shouldn't our government
be overthrown by now?

56
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:03,477
Uh, elaborate.

57
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,280
There's no real justice anymore.

58
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:10,282
Most laws today do more for keeping criminals
out of jail and on the streets.

59
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,759
And cops use the law to harass the innocent
and exploit minorities.

60
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,677
Yeah, l mean, l do see your perspective,

61
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:20,119
Um, but here, we have due process.

62
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:24,765
So, people are innocent until proven guilty,
$0 people do have a chance, right?

63
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,164
To show that they haven't done
anything wrong.

64
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:31,561
Ultimately, keep in mind that we're all here,
we're all thriving.

65
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,564
We're in one of the best countries
in the world.

66
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,837
We're all in class,
we're all learning, right?

67
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:39,085
So, l do believe the law system works.
And l think it's important.

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,557
Your family witnessed a murder.

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,680
Rival gang.

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,238
They were in turn gunned down

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,871
because, uh, they wanted the identity
of the assailant to remain secret.

Seems like your family was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,354
You know, we're gonna nail this guy.

153
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,996
But that's it.

154
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,239
That's the only reason they were killed?
For that?

155
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,913
You know, I've been in Homicide, Doctor,
for more than eight years now, and uh...

156

ever a good reason,

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,270
That's it.

158
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,400
We'll do the best we can on this thing.

159
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,229
In fact, there was a witness
that we've identified

160
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,633
and we do have one suspect in custody.

161
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,910

I'm gonna write him up, and then...

165
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,030

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,791
Mm-hm.,

177
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,757
Your every move is...

178
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,950
being recorded.

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,158
Oh. It's a good thing I'm handcuffed
and whispering.

180
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,436
Yeah.

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,278
Are you Catholic, Trigger?

182
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,756
Uh, until l reached the age of reason.

183
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,756
Is, uh... "Trigger" your given name?

184
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,915
Am l being detained?

185
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,759
Yeah, I'd say that you were being detained.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,753
OK. That's a different discussion then,
entirely.

187
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,229
You're being detained,
and you're being interrogated.

188
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,795
What am l being charged with?

189
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,960
What have we got? Um, assault,
attempted murder, and maybe even murder.

190
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,078
Wow. Glad you guys didn't pick me up
for that jaywalking.

191
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,717
There were other assailants as well,
but our witness was unable to ID them.

192
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,990
Naturally, we'll assume they were members
of Trigger's posse.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,470
We figure we'll stick him in a vice
and clamp it shut.

194
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,596
Maybe he'll rat out the others
in exchange for leniency.

195
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,713
Well, that's not exactly true.

196
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,633
But zoologist... that was up my alley.

197
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,309
To work with your mother.

198
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,879
I'm sure you loved putting pins
in butterflies when you were a child.

199
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,030
HE SCOFFS

200
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,312
Viceroy butterfly's not poisonous.

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,791
It looks exactly like a monarch butterfly,
the orange ones we see the most.

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,836
They're very poisonous.

203
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,917
Birds don't eat it
or they get stomach aches and die

204
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,870
but...

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,399
They don't bother the monarch

206
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,319
cos it looks like what's poisonous

207
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,239
and if you take the insides out of a monarch
and leave it on the sidewalk

208
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,395
a bird'll leave it alone.

209
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,230
That fascinates me

210
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,994
and it should fascinate you,
because you're talkin' to a monarch.

211
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,636
Trust me.

212
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,313
Leniency, he's not gonna get.

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,552
This is a game, and it's ridiculous.

214
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,352
L didn't kill anybody,
1'd like to talk to a lawyer

215
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,394
and l would like that known.

216
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,230
You can pretend you didn't hear me,
but I'm saying out loud, this is enough.

217
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,596
I'd like to talk to my lawyer,
since I'm being detained.

218
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,198
You guys wanna get sucked off or...
what should we do now?

219
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,159
The view's pretty amazing.

220
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,430
You can see Catalina,
if you look to the right.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,118
So, it's super important
we get these done tonight.

222
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,631
L don't really think drinking's
part of the job.

223
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,030
Uh, it is. If you work hard enough,
you can celebrate.

224
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,070
Cheers.

225
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,876

Sometimes l just get carried away
at how pretty you are

232
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,755
and how smart you are.

233
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,838
Thank you.

I don't know.

241
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,594
L didn't really eat anything today.

242
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,950
Well, the wine'll help.

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,070
No, l feel... something's wrong.

244
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,710
Maybe you're overheated. Maybe just put that,
put that hair back a little.

245
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,389
Please don't touch me.

If l want a maid I'm gonna fuck,
I'm just gonna fuck her.

A topless maid is just gonna dust your dick.

WOMAN LAUGHS

350
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,958
You don't need your appendix,
unless you eat raw meat, so you...

351
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,272
One guy hit a golf ball off the moon.

352
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,512
It's still going, unless intruded upon
by an outside force.

353
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,079
Is that inertia?
- Salut!

354
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,910
It is immoral, society, these people.
I don't know who they are.

355
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,279
L don't care, but l want...
INDISTINCT CHATTER

356
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,838
- Hey, how you guys doing?
- That's the prop.

357
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,998
Oh! You know what?
I'm glad l didn't have that drink.

358
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,675
You wanna come hold it for me?

359
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,436
I'm not good for more than half a round.
- WOMAN LAUGHS

360
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,795
Is he going to be dead?

361
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,710
Oh, don't kill me. What could kill me?
L can't kill me.

362
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,510
Do go back...

363
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,950
Do go back and get Kleen, though.
He's a good man.

364
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,434
You gotta get these out...

365
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,994
l can't even get at it.

366
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,829
GUN COCKS

367
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,155
WOMAN SCREAMS

368
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,119
GUNSHOTS

WOMEN YELL

370
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,359
WOMEN SCREAM

371
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,672
GUNSHOT
- HE SCREAMS

372
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,672
GUNFIRE

373
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,789
WOMEN SCREAM

374
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,513
GUNFIRE

375
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,913
HE GRUNTS

376
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,590
You must have a fucking death wish.

377
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,439
You just came and broke up my party.

378
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,796
HE GRUNTS

379
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,117
Stop making noises like that. It's silly.
Doesn't look right.

380
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,997
Really thought you were Scarface
comin' up in here,

381
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,072
HE SCREAMS

382
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,998
HE SCREAMS
Stop!

383
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,034
Pretty big balls.

384
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,439
Who the fuck are you?

385
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,474
You killed my wife, you son of a bitch!
My family!

386
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,510
OK. Yeah, you were with that white lady
and that little girl.

387
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,154
L shot 'em.
- Fuck you, man!

388
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,029
You got kind of a potty mouth.

389
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,270
NOLAN GRUNTS

390
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,954
You act like they were special or somethin'
but they weren't.

391
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,275
Fuck you, man!

392
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,355
HE YELLS

393
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,079
People get killed up here all the time.

394
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,919
Just cos it's a fancy neighbourhood
doesn't mean people don't die.

395
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,637
What the fuck were they doin' driving
through the barrio?

396
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,633
Why was your wife taking that
sexy little girl through the barrio?

397
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,755
Get up!

398
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,316
Get up!

399
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,477
You killed my wife, you son of a bitch.
- GUN COCKS

00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,675
1'm gonna kill you!

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,593
- Alright...
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

402
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,280
Freeze! Drop it!

403
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,396
Drop it now.

404
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,431
Drop the gun now, goddamn it,
or we'll drop you!

405
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,110
I'm unarmed.

406
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,918
INDISTINCT CHATTER

407
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,595
Oh, shit,

408
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,834
What's up?
- Nothing. L know the guy.

409
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,194
You clipped one in the side,
and the other in the shoulder.

410
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,194
You're lucky they're gonna live.

411
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,354
Illegal possession...

412
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,354
intent to kill.

413
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,520
Can't walk away from this one.

414
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,757
All counts against you, this time around.

415
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,474
You shouldn't have gone after them,

416
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,829
l shouldn't have had to.

417
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,670
The prosecution is sympathetic
to your position,

418
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,120
He believes it was grief that caused your,
uh, temporary lack of judgment.

419
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,834
And he's agreed to reduce the charges.

420
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,150
Attempted murder...
assault with a deadly weapon.

421
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,596
But, um, you're gonna have to plead guilty.

422
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,395
What? That's sympathetic to my position?

423
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,869
I have to plead guilty?

424
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,559
Look--
- Uh, that's not justice!

425
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,917
L mean, no offence, but that's not justice.

426
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,510
It's not a matter of whether you attacked
these guys or didn't.

427
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,115
There's plenty of witnesses.

428
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,678
You're gonna do time,
it's just a matter of how much.

429
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,790
Listen.

430
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,671
We go to trial with this, it's gonna take
over a year to even get there.

431
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,038
It carries a much longer sentence
if convicted.

432
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,830
Take the deal.

433
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,433

You want it?

No thanks, man. L got enough.

feel real good.

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,996
It's alright.

445
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,229
Thanks, man.
- It's alright.

446
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,920
Fuck that dude, you know...

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,680
You seen these before?
- Come on, snap-shap on the bottle of Dom.

450
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,439
You got it.
- HE LAUGHS

451
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,239
Whoah, fucking... that's it.

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,313

Hey. If it's not too much trouble...

458
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,873
you wanna help me bounce these wankers?
- Yeah. Nicely done.

459
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,353
Let's go! Come on.

460
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,834
Come on, Guido.
- Fuck off.

461
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,956
Go on.

462
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,230
Fuck off.

463
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,600
Thank you, guys, $0 much.
How can l repay you?

464
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,750
It's alright, sweetie.

465
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,629
Hey, you remember me?

466
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,118
Now it's your turn to get fucked.

467
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,156
HE CHUCKLES

468
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,960
That's right, bitch!

469
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,114
NOLAN GRUNTS
- Better cover that ass. Huh?

470
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,357
Better get used to being on those

471
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,875
NOLAN COUGHS

472
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,355
Hey, excuse me.

473
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,510
Fuck off, man.

474
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,273
THEY GRUNT

475
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,155

476
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,869
Fuck's sake, guys.

477
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,033
Now, you wanna spend a month in the hole?
Stick around. Guard!

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,635
Get the fuck outta here, now!

479
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,030
Buncha pussies.

480
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,272
Hey, let me help you up.
- NOLAN COUGHS

481
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,633
You doin' OK?
- Yeah, man. L coulda done that.

482
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,439
NOLAN COUGHS
- Yeah, l saw that.

483
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,599
Y'know, besides burying your head
in those law books, you might wanna study up

484
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,034
on how to stay the fuck alive in here.

485
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,713
Yeah. I'm startin' to realise that.

486
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,155
What's your name anyway?

487
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,838
Hank.
- Nolan. Thank you, seriously.

488
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,992
No problem.
- What are you doin' here?

489
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,271
I'm a lawyer.
- Hank the lawyer, huh?

490
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,676
Man, l don't even know how l got here,
to be honest with you.

491
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,872
Well, most people who commit crimes
end up here.

492
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,549
Well, if tryin' to kill the man who killed
my family is a crime

493
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,916
1 guess I'm a criminal.

494
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,275
Stay outta trouble.

495
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,793
Don't worry, we'll get you fixed up.

496
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,119
You're pretty brave for a new guy.

497
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,438
But you got a serious death wish,
takin' on Cam.

498
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,875
Yeah, well, people keep telling me that,
but...

499
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,198
l just didn't want to get raped today.

500
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,838
I've never had to fight like this.

501
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,870
Look. The only language they speak
in this place...

502
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,235
is violence.

503
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,995
It's Kill... or be killed.

504
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,589
It's a different world in here.

505
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,397
And you speak it, or sooner or later
you're gonna get popped.

506
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,679
Yeah, well, l don't know the first thing.

507
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,592
Not about knowing. It's about survival.

508
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,196
The ones who make it out...
align themselves with a group.

509
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,955
For protection.

510
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,315
There's safety in numbers.

511
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,834
Or you can, uh,
just learn to fight like heck.

512
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,429
Yeah, well, maybe I'll go for the latter.

513
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,915
HE LAUGHS

514
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,195
Well, good luck on that.

515
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,115
Name's Jackson, by the way.

516
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,520
L don't know about makin' friends
with guards either, though.

517
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,439
Oh...

518
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,390
So you don't wanna make nice with the inmates

519
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,432
and you don't wanna make nice
with the guards.

520
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,949
Shit, man...

521
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,550
For a second there l thought
you were really serious

522
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,398
about getting out of this hole

523
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,515
in one piece.

524
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,109
Look, man. I'm sorry.

525
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,436
The name's Nolan,

526
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,320
I'm just in way over my head.

527
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,398
And ll don't really know what to do.

528
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,110
L understand.

529
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,154
You're lucky Hank saved your ass.

530
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,310
So... who is that guy?

531
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,269
Hank Carmac.

532
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,272
Does pro-bono work here in the prison

533
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,119
for inmates he feels were locked up unjustly.

534
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,270
Self-made man, lives by a code.
It's rare for a lawyer.

535
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,274
How'd he learn to fight like that?

536
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,759
L don't know,
but word is he's a military man

537
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,358
passed the bar, got his law degree
on the government dime and never looked back.

538
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,399
Hmm. Man on a mission, huh?

539
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,432
Trust me, Hank is a man you should have
in your corner.

540
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,630
NOLAN SOBS

541
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,595
HE YELLS

542
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,237
HE YELLS

543
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,638
HE SOBS

544
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,598
Mm.
- Guess you're ready for another, Hank?

545
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,114
You know me too well, Chris, Cheers,

546
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,991
Sorry we're late.

547
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,037
L hate it when someone's
supposed to pick you up

548
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,435
and they're a half hour late

549
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,757
cos l always find myself staring
at my cell phone wondering what that's for.

550
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,115
Ah, you know how she is.

551
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,239
Some asshole decided to go on
a shooting spree over at China Garden

552
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,435
and l got caught up.

553
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,556
Thank you.

554
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,476
What you got?

555
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,909
Interesting case.

556
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,358
This guy l met inside the Pen. Take a look.

557
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,110
Come on, Hank!

558
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,833
Beat some down, help some get out?

559
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,111
Ah, come on, Amanda. You know the deal.
Justice is case by case, you know that.

560
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,392
This guy, his family was killed.

561
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,751
People that did it killed the only witness.
Strangled her.

562
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,195
So, they walked.

563
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,754
So, what's he doin' in lockdown?

564
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,759
Just what you'd be doin', man.
Bashin' heads. Tryin' to stay alive.

565
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,950
The Keystone Cops are real proud
of themselves, l guess.

566
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,838
Of all the sorry bastards in the cage

567
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,434
almost every one of them screams
he got a bad deal on the daily.

568
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,080
Yeah, you're right.
But this one actually did.

569
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,149
DOOR CLANKS

570
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,792
Hey, Nolan, get up! L got good news.

571
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,679
These are from Hank. He took your case.

572
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,000
INDISTINCT CHATTER
- DISTANT ALARM RINGS

573
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,190
TATTOO MACHINE BUZZES
- You gotta get outta here.

574
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,479
This ain't no place for a person like you.

575
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,037
You know, with the rest of these animals.
You're not like them.

576
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,593
You know, you don't have to be.
You got a chance to start a new life.

577
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,440
Y'know, l know without your family,
it's gonna be hard

578
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,871
but you've gotta get rid of the hatred,
you've gotta get rid of the feeling

579
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,634
you've gotta get back to the freedom,
the freedom that's in your mind.

580
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,680
Shit, it's lookin' good.

581
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,555
Almost done, bro.

582
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,312
Almost finished with your next book?

583
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,835
See, l told you your best bet
was to connect with Hank.

584
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,039
Yeah, man. He has been instrumental.

585
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,909
In fact, if it wasn't for you and Hank,
I'd be dead by now.

586
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,395
You know, you're one of the few people
in here that deserves to be on the outside

587
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,560
doing whatever it is you need to do
to seek justice

588
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,599
and try to heal yourself.

589
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,116
Thank you, man.

590
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,759
See you at the arraignment.

591
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,510
What's up, bitch?

592
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,272
Word is you're getting outta here real soon,
since you're the lawyer's biatch,

593
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,750
Relax, seriously!

594
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,592
We have some unfinished business,
motherfucker.

595
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,190
Hm?

596
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,830
HE SHOUTS

597
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,198
INMATES YELL

598
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,316
Get him, kick his ass!

599
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,389
Come on, take him down!

600
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,158
INMATES YELL

601
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,995
Shit!

602
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,590
Hey, Nolan.

603
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,399
Nolan, you hear me? Get over here.

604
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,154
Yeah, man. L can hear you.

605
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,919
HANK SIGHS

606
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,792
You know, when l first took your case

607
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,278
I thought l was lookin' at a man
with principle

608
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,118
a man who wanted to satisfy justice.

609
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,798
L was protecting myself, Hank.

610
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,791
OK.

611
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,000
Because the last think l need
is for you to be in the hole

612
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,796
right before l can get you out,
you understand?

613
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,119
This system doesn't work, Hank.
You're the one who taught me that, right?

614
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,633
Nolan, do you wanna get out of here?

615
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,475
You know, l used to lecture my students
on having faith in the law?

616
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,911
L used to think that America was founded
on some sort of truth and justice.

617
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,915
This country is turning into
a piece of shit, Hank!

618
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,195
And I'm in the fucking hole!
I'm in the fucking hole!

619
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,590
For what?

620
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,199
My family was kKilled!

621
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,037
Trigger should be in this fuckin' hole!

622
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,874
Yes. Yes, he should.

623
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,396
But I'm using my time...

624
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,110
my resources, my energy.

625
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,840
L could be having dinner, l could be fucking
right now but I'm here with you.

626
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,398
And I'm just asking for two damn months.
Two months. That's it.

627
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,393
Man, l got nothing out there anyway.

628
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,796
Come on, Nolan,
stop feeling fucking sorry for yourself.

629
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,791
You got even less in here and you know it.

630
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,269
What happened to Cam anyway?

631
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,996
Cam?

632
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,277
I don't give a fuck about Cam

633
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,033
and nor should you, that piece of shit...

634
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,673
shot a young girl in the face, 17 years old.

635
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,075
Even after she emptied the register.
Now l told you...

636
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,071
to keep it low-key, not to fuckin' worry
about other criminals in here. You hear me?

637
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,475
Yeah, l hear you, man.

638
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,112
Good. Cos the next time,
you kick him harder. OK?

639
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,200
THEY SNIGGER

640
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,757
You trust me, right?
- Of course l do.

641
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,791
Good.

642
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,279
So give me a reason to trust you.

643
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,158
We are almost there.

644
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,717
And l promise you,
I'll get you outta this place.

645
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,520
But keep your nose clean, OK?

646
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,359
Yeah. L will.

647
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,556
See you soon.

648
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,996
Yeah, alright.

649
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,960
Dr Cooray, you've served 12 months
of a two-year sentence.

650
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,637
Would you say you feel rehabilitated?

651
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,590
Dr Cooray?

652
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,349
L feel he is.

653
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,234
Been a model prisoner.

654
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,235
A hard worker, too.

655
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,355
And always does as he is told.

656
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,110
Hm.

657
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,432
Well, it says here he's gotten
into a few scrapes during his stay.

658
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,033
Spent some time in solitary confinement.

659
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,556
That is true.

660
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,389
But l was present for all

661
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,512
and they were definitely cases
of self-preservation.

662
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,838
Well, l see you got Hank Carmac, Esquire
representing you today.

663
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,030
Yes, sir.

664
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,272
Sir, we are well aware of your efforts
to rehabilitate inmates.

665
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,478
Given, you are his lawyer

666
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,634
but are you also saying that you would
vouch for him personally?

667
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,350
Absolutely, sir. He's a good man.

668
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,635
I think he's served enough time

669
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,399
to reflect upon his single instance of bad
behaviour due to the...

670
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,275
tragic, terrible loss of his family.
His wife, his child.

671
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,470
I know he takes full responsibility
for his actions

672
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,799
and has expressed to me many times
his desire to get back to work

673
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,520
as a teacher at the International University,
where he feels...

674
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,319
frankly, as do I,
he can contribute positively

675
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,959
to the young minds of this country.

676
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,472
Ahem. Dr Cooray...

677
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,640
if you were to be released

678
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,035
is there any chance that you may
again seek retribution

679
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,949
for the wrong that you feel's
been committed against you?

680
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,509
Absolutely not, sir,

681
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,755
l made a big mistake.

682
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,270
L should leave law enforcement
up to the professionals.

683
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,509
And l promise you l pose no threat
to the people outside of these walls.

684
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,074
L know what l did was wrong

685
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,114
and l've realised that now.

686
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,955
And l am truly sorry.

687
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,195
Hey, Nolan, you know of a place
called the Soi Dog Tavern?

688
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,119
Nah.
- Well, cool little bar.

689
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,396
Every Wednesday night, me and my friends,
we get together.

690
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,353
Shoot the shit, drink some shit.

691
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,999
You should come and join us one night.

692
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,595
Thank you, man.
L do appreciate that, brother. For real.

693
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,556
Of course.

- Hey!
- And so soon!

699
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,070
L didn't think 1'd see you this soon,
if at all. How are you?

700
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,669
Come on, meet my friends.
This is Damian, my good friend.

701
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,160
Hey, man. How are you?

702
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,431
This is Amanda.

703
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,875
Hey. We've heard a lot about you.
- Hey! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

704
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,798
Kimberly, Chris, could you hook us up
with some drinks?

705
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,754
Let's catch up.
- Absolutely!

706
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,959
Bryant and Plaza.
They worked point on your case, right?

707
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,871
Do you know them?

708
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,759
Good cops. Both of them.

709
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,159
Rare things these days.
- It is.

710
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,996
Amanda's one of those.
She wears a badge, too.

711
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,394
Really?
=L try.

712
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,634
And these two misfits, believe it or not,
used to be partners.

713
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,678
Yeah, until l took early retirement.

714
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,837
Due to excessive use of force, they said.

715
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,316
Yeah, he split the wig
of an unarmed dope pusher.

716
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,439
HE LAUGHS
That dope pusher was a stone-cold killer.

717
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,750
And if l didn't take him out,
he was gonna kKill someone else.

718
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,836
Makes a good point.

719
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,077
Things have spiralled
out of control in the city.

720
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,755
Yeah, seems like that.

721
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,474
Yaba is to this city
what Molly is to Coachella.

722
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,911
Yeah, what happened to you,
where the guilty go free?

723
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,553
Happens more than the PD
would want you to know.

724
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,679
Gettin' off on technicalities, plea bargains,
dead witnesses. You name it.

725
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,751
You know, they are releasing violent felons
because there's overcrowding in prisons.

726
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,155
The system is broken.

727
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,795
Well, you know why?
Cos they give more of a fuck

728
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,678
about the rights of the criminals
than they do the victims.

729
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,357
And even when we do get the perps,
sometimes we can't make the evidence stick.

730
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,113
Even when it's obvious who the guilty are.

731
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,951
You know, l looked at your case.

732
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,960
They strangled your witness, huh?

733
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,677
Yeah, man, I'm still tryin' to figure out
how to get this fucker behind bars.

734
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,635
You don't need bars.

735
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,397
We've found other ways
to deal with those assholes.

736
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,230
Really?
- Yeah.

737
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,319
You guys vigilantes or somethin'?

738
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,109
Why? You curious?

739
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,989
You damn right I'm curious.

740
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,152
You know, there are over 300 homicides
a year in this city?

741
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,270
Despite what they tell you,
hard drugs are on the rise.

742
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,992
This new strain of yaba's deadly.

743
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,632
It's a blend of crystal meth and caffeine.

744
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,354
Instant addiction.

745
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,149
My parents, they used to leave their
doors unlocked.

746
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,876
Mine too.

747
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,469
Now good people like that
are afraid to go out after dark.

748
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,591
If you're afraid to open your front door
cos you don't know who's on the other side

749
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,393
you're livin' in fear.
- Yep.

750
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,114
And if you're not afraid,
you just don't know how bad it's got.

751
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,630
Innocent people, gettin' killed every day.

752
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,637
The gitl that gets raped,
what happened to you...

753
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,109
me and my family.

754
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,919

778
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,712
It's OK. Give it to him.

779
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,389
Gimme that. Gimme that.

780
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,359
Yeah, this is it. It's got that gun logo
we've been seein' around.

781
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,510
Just like we thought.

782
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,514
Question is, where'd you get it?

783
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,514
Nowhere, money. L run this shit.

784
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,717
Mm. "Yo, money," huh? Motherfucker.

Gets it shipped, postage free,

790
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,795
Well, that was easy.

791

Hey, what's up, man? You OK?

812
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,953
You know when l asked if you guys
were vigilantes, l was joking, right?

813
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,397
You can't just go around
shooting people, Hank!

814
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,359
Wh-why? Why, because your way's
working so well?

815
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,510

L have shit to lose, too.
And you can trust me on this.

I've thought about this long and hard, OK?

00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,635
like he did yours, like he did mine?

824
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,239
That was different!
- How? How?

825
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,993
Cos these motherfuckers,
they don't play fair!

826
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,792
They do not play by the rules, OK?

827
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,311
They don't respect Amanda.
They don't respect me, you

829

You think we would have got Jinx
if we weren't here? Huh?

830
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,278
You think he would've handed over Omari

See, we don't need search warrants.
We don't need due fuckin' process.

00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,359
We solve the case, we give it to the cops.
Hand it to 'em with a fucking bow on top.

834
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,510
That's what we do here!

You're crazy. You know that, right?

00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,436
Maybe... yeah, maybe.

839
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,598
But l guess some motherfucker has to be, huh?

840
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,749
Look, I'm sure l don't have to remind you,
Nolan, how important it is

841

00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,196
So, you think that Trigger
may have done it himself?

Eh, Wanda Esparza was strangled.

865
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,073
And they found some fingernails
on her clothing and...

866
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,429
you know, you ask me? Do the math.
One plus one equals motherfucking two.

We're workin' on it.

What? L mean, what does that mean?

1036
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:04,920
It means that l went to the man's house.
He wasn't there.

1037
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,475
L talked to his mother.
She said she hadn't seen him in months.

1038
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,872
Right. And you believed her?

1039
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,870
Look, there's no love lost between those two.

1040
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,277
Alright? He's not a model son.

1041
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,875
Right, so he's probably hiding out
at a friend's house or somethin'.

1042
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,399
Yeah, yeah, probably. But you know what?

1043
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,717
We can't knock down every door
in the hood lookin' for his ass.

1044
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,949
OK? He could be anywhere.

1045
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,071
We're gonna get him this time,
don't you worry.

1046
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,435
"Don't worry"?

1047
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,029
"Don't worry", Detective?

1048
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,754
How the hell are you gonna tell me that?

1049
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,511
Every time we get close to bringin' Trigger
to justice, this guy frickin' disappears.

1050
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,709
You let us do our job.

1051
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,396
Right, yeah. You guys do your job.

1052
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,279
Frankly, this was my last hope, Detective.
Honestly.

1053
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,879
And you guys can't even find him!

1054
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,476
We have DNA on him.
It's just a matter of time.

1055
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,233
L understand. But then what happens?

1056
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,789
He's gonna get off on some technicality
and then he's back on the streets.

1057
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,958
You know what?
You need to let the wheels of justice roll.

1058
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,039
You're tired. Go home.
You're beat, you're whooped. Get some rest.

1059
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,312
I'll call you, let you know, you know,
if 1 talk to anybody.

1060
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,277
If l get some more information. Alright?

1061
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,949
OK, alright.
Alright, but find him for me, please.

1062
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,391
Please.

1063
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,836
Alright.

1064
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,756
What's up, Ponds? Covington.

1065
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,119
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

1066
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,594
Nolan. What are you doing here?

1067
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,911
Hey.

1068
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,511
So, l got a call from Detective Bryant.
They have a warrant out for Trigger's arrest.

1069
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,354
And?
- And so l came in to check in on it.

1070
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,916
They find him?

1071
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,516
No.

1072
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,392
And you still have the nerve
to act surprised.

1073
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,956
Look. All l want to say is...

1074
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,637
you being here is making me
a little uncomfortable.

1075
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,234
You either do things our way

1076
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,909
or you keep clinging to the shipwreck
we call law and order.

1077
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,670
But you don't try and keep your feet stuck
in both worlds.

1078
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,789
Last time l remembered, you're still a cop,
right, Amanda?

1079
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,555
I'm not a cop.

1080
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,356
I'm a scout.

1081
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,638
If we don't have intel, we got nothing.

1082
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,199
Detective Bryant is a good cop.

1083
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,875
But he's an idealist.

1084
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,716
I'm a realist.

1085
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,838
Yeah, alright. L get it.

1086
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,517
Even if Trigger goes down,
it's for killing a snitch.

1087
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,112
Not for what he did
to your wife and daughter.

1088
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,634
Ask yourself, is that really justice?

1089
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,400
One minute he's breaking down some dealer,
and the next he's at the station

1090
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,635
chatting with detectives.

1091
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,072
L mean, for such a smart guy,
he seems pretty confused.

1092
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,630
No shit. How the fuck can you be so sure
this guy's not gonna flip?

1093
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,673
Like l keep tellin' you,
l think he's one of us.

1094
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,837
Look, Hank. L can't say l have
your confidence in the guy...

1095
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,717
but I trust your judgment.
- HANK SIGHS

1096
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,320
Fuck me, guys.
Look, look, l think he's got his head

1097
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,157
wrapped around this Trigger guy,
if I'm honest.

1098
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,713
That might clear him a bit, sure.
But it's easier said than done.

1099
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,270
The cops have been tossing
every nook and cranny in this barrio

1100
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,555
and still haven't found jack-shit.

1101
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,558
He's probably already south of the border.

1102
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,030
.
C'mon, man.

1103
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,795
He's made this city his fuckin' home.
There's no way he's leaving.

1104
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,953
How the hell can you be so sure of that?

1105
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,956
Would you?

1106
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,510
You got a gun, Amanda. You got a badge.

1107
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,838
And you got a fuckin' passport
to wherever that fuck might be holed up.

1108
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,270
So, go find him.

1109
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,829
And find him your way.

1110
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,595
Get it done, Amanda.

1111
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,031
Hey.

1112
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,391
Hey.

1113
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,360
So, we heard you went to the PD yesterday.

1114
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,194
Look, l already told Amanda...

1115
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,395
Yeah, we know.

1116
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,594
They're not gonna find him, are they?

1117
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,390
Nope. Not the legit way.

1118
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,279
So, l guess you can continue sittin' around
on your ass doing nothing

1119
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,079
waiting for a system that keeps failing you,
or you can, uh...

1120
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,999
you can do something about it, Nolan,

1121
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,989
Fuck it. I'm in.

1122
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,152
'Bout time. Get moving, Nolan.

1123
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,234
I'll see it... and I'll raise it.

1124
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,350
How much is that?

1125
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,790
Will you match that for me, honey?
Just one white and blue there.

1126
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,990
Walit, it's my turn. L go after him,

1127
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,595
You tell her.
- Clockwise.

1128
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,075
You can't do that, I'm supposed...
You know what? Fuck it. All in.

1129
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,675
Ha!
- Big boy.

1130
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,516
L don't even have that much.
- You went to college?

1131
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,758
Well, if you count
Folsom State Prison college, then yeah.

1132
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,314
L took a class or two up there.

1133
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,913
You're all in?
- Yeah.

1134
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,952
Did you--
- Who put my gun on top of the weed?

1135
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,398
That wasn't me.
- Whose weed?

1136
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,950
One of these girls brought it.
I'm not sure which one.

1137
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,794
Never accountable, are you?
You never just say, "l did it."

1138
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,634
L don't want to rat anybody out or anything.
- 0K

1139
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,875
- Hey, Nolan.
- Yeah?

1140
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,030
This is for you.

1141
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,629
It's loaded. Safety's on.

1142
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,432
You're rollin' with the big dudes tonight,
man.

1143
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,190
Just stay out of the way
and don't shoot your dick off.

1144
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,396
MUFFLED SCREAMS

1145
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,354
What are we doing here?

1146
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,750
This.

1147
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,069
What the hell?

1148
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,520
Yeah, you were right.

1149
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,037
He snitched. That's why he's out.
- No!

1150
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,629
Lucky for us,
Detective Bryant got Omari locked up.

1151
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,314
He gave up Jinx's whereabouts.

1152
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,357
JINX GRUNTS
- Disloyal motherfuckers, huh?

1153
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,795
Seems like our friend Jinx here
knows more than he was lettin' on, hm?

1154
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,995
No, no, no!

1155
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,957
Oh, he knows. He just hasn't told us yet.

1156
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,400
SWITCHBLADE CLICKS
- Well...

1157
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,309
We need intel, so we're gonna find out
one way or the other,

1158
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,472
Oh, he's gonna tell us.
- JINX MOANS

1159
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,074
Is this true?
- Nol

1160
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,559
You know where Trigger is?
- No!

1161
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,035
Huh?
- Nol

1162
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,590
- Here's your chance.
- Fuck, this shit again?

1163
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,274
1 ain't gonna tell you nothin', man!
- Ah. Is that so?

1164
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,072
You shitched to get out of jail.
Now your boy Omari snitched on you.

1165
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,151
You motherfuckers have no honour at all.

1166
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,156
Yeah.

1167
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,278
Yeah, l gave up some snow-white politicians
trolling for ass in the bartio.

1168
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,439
But Trigger gonna kill me if l give him up,
man. He runs this town!

1169
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,310
HE SCREAMS

1170
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,554
Time to talk, motherfucker!

1171
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,230
You will tell me where he is right now

1172
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,311
or I'm gonna break every fuckin'
bone in your body!

1173
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,313
Now!
- JINX SCREAMS

1174
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,834
0K, OK, OK!

1175
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,955
I'ma tell ya'll!

1176
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,754
But when you catch that motherfucker,
do me a favour.

1177
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,514
Smoke his ass, man!
You'd be doing everybody a favour.

1178
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,360
Hey.
- Down there is Trigger's safe house.

1179
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,797
Well, it ain't safe anymore.
- GUN COCKS

1180
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,869
He's in there playing poker
with a few thugs and their girls.

1181
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,071
Looks like he hired a special forces
bodyguard too

1182
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,918
since he knows the heat
is coming down on him.

1183
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,030
GUN COCKS

1184
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,919
You know the drill.
- Yep.

1185
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,598
HELICOPTER WHIRS

1186
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,637
l have the drop
on a possible location of a perp.

1187
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,239
Take me downtown immediately.

1188
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,756
Bryan...

1189
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,991
STAIRS CREAK
- He's big.

1190
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,756
GUNSHOT

1191
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,555
GUNSHOT

1192
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,592
Sir, there's been a report of shots
fired downtown by the railroad tracks.

1193
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,992
You're a cheater, man.
- How did l cheat?

1194
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,796
The last time you dealed, you had two aces.

1195
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,911
There's only one way to solve this, OK?

1196
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,551
You guys go for a long drive,
suck each other's dicks

1197
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,994
and then drive off a cliff.

1198
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,589
GUNSHOT

1199
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,471
Trigger!

1200
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,476
Get up now!

1201
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,673
Get the fuck up now! Get up!

1202
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,830
