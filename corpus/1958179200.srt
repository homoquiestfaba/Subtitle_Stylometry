1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,875
(uplifting music)

2
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:22,585
(light drumming music)

3
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:42,894
(solemn trumpet music)

4
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:45,630
(audience applauding)

5
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,330
- If you go back to where I began,

6
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,940
and you think of those three deaths

7
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,120
and what they meant to your life

8
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,570
and how difficult it is to believe

9
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,470
that all three were the work

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,183
of three separated, isolated, lone gunmen.

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,260
But even if you accept that,

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,860
think of it as the coming of tragedy

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,140
into American life for the first time

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,443
since the 19th century Civil War.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,210
Think of what that tragedy means

16
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,030
in terms of our own diminishment.

17
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,320
My friend Jack Newfield, who was with me

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,850
during the time of the
killing of Robert Kennedy,

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,870
said, "With that death
our generation became

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,341
might-have-beens,

21
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,390
(gun banging)

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,980
doomed forever to live,

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,780
never to know what might have been

24
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,510
of our lives and of our country's lives."

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,430
We can debate whether John Kennedy

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,200
would've gotten out of Vietnam.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,730
I happen to think he would have.

28
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,130
We can debate whether Robert Kennedy

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,620
would've expanded a non-violent struggle

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,800
to include poverty as
well as civil rights.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
I think he would've.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,090
We can debate whether Robert Kennedy

33
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,560
might've been the nominee

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,250
and would've defeated
Richard Nixon in 1968.

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,490
I happen to think that he would have.

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,400
But it doesn't matter what you think.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,230
These are our projections

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,000
based on our best analysis,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,620
based on all we know.

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,060
It doesn't matter what conclusion

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,340
we draw about the hypothetical.

42
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,490
What we do know

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,036
is that our lives were wrecked.

44
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,453
(solemn music continues)

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,423
And to think that three deranged killers,

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,440
one dead, two in jail,

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,513
are responsible for this wreckage,

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,150
it simply makes no sense to me

49
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,290
and I know it makes no sense

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,063
to most people in this country.

51
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,500
- There's no political left
left in American politics.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,390
The right determines who
will live in the White House.

53
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,320
The left determines who will be

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,420
head of the English department.

55
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,567
It's like Lyndon Johnson said,

56
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,790
"You don't have to worry about the left.

57
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,750
They'll never pick up a gun.

58
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,490
It's the right you have to worry about.

59
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,050
If they don't get what they want,

60
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,790
they'll blow your fucking head off."

61
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,930
The only people

62
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,880
approved for listening to in this society

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,713
are millionaires.

64
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,890
- Is everything okay?

65
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,480
- [Elizabeth] Yeah.

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,030
- Yes, yes, wonderful, thanks.

67
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,150
- I know who you are.

68
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,850
I've seen you on a talk show.

69
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,690
- Oh, it's always good to hear

70
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,090
from the younger generation.

71
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,153
- [Waitress] You're a great filmmaker.

72
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,650
- You must be a millionaire

73
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,810
in order to be listened
to in this society.

74
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,380
I mean, Bush, Quail, Arsenio,
Schwarzenegger, Ross Perot,

75
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,690
Dan Rather, they're all millionaires.

76
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,620
And if you don't share

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,020
their millionaire's notion of reality,

78
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,520
why, you're a wacko.

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
I mean, you're impotent,

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,880
you're irrelevant.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,890
Why, you're even ill mannered.

82
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,723
You're hungry.

83
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:09,660
You could be uninsured,

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,493
you could be homeless.

85
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,390
But really it doesn't really matter

86
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,220
because nobody's listening.

87
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,450
- [Reporter] Despite the slippage

88
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,790
in the president's popularity this winter,

89
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,040
George Bush is starting to suggest

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,380
that the economy is
actually in better shape

91
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,670
than people think.

92
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,890
- [George] Most people
would say that 2% growth

93
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,540
is not recessionary.

94
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,440
And there's some areas

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,910
that are still hurting

96
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,640
but clearly this is a good sign

97
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,350
and there are a lot of other good signs.

98
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,183
- [Reporter] Of course,

99
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,590
the upbeat economic news is moderate

100
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,390
and Republican strategists are wary

101
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,251
of claiming outright via
the end of the recession.

102
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,683
- What are you doing?

103
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,090
(gun clicks)

104
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,136
- Just thinking.

105
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,650
- About what?

106
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,874
Getting a new television set?

107
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,707
- No.

108
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:53,943
About what Lyndon Johnson said.

109
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:58,050
He said, "You'd never have
to worry about the left

110
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,360
'cause they'd never pick up a gun."

111
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,230
He wasn't wrong.

112
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,063
- It's not true.

113
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:04,410
The weathermen planted
bombs all over the place.

114
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,240
- And who'd they kill?

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,760
Nixon, Reagan, Bush.

116
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,160
Our radicals were not killers.

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,140
They were desperate hippies.

118
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,980
When the hippies lost,

119
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,780
they became yuppies.

120
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,400
The legacy of the '60s

121
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,750
was don't fuck with the real powers

122
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,700
or you'll get shot.

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
- Arthur, that's history.

124
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,420
Nobody's interested in
history but school teachers.

125
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,310
- Yeah, but suppose Johnson was right

126
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,380
just about his own time.

127
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,960
Suppose everything that's
happened since then

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,420
finally woke somebody up,

129
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,180
created an assassin from the left.

130
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,360
Someone who is willing to return fire.

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,190
- I'll be damned if I'm gonna rollover

132
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,023
for a lot of-

133
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:44,640
- There are an awful lot
of angry people out there,

134
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,900
all on the edge.

135
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,093
One little push and that could happen.

136
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,713
- You're starting to
make me nervous, Arthur.

137
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,650
- Think about it.

138
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,163
Change the course of history,

139
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,613
bend the political wheels of November,

140
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,010
all with a piece of metal

141
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,753
no bigger than my little finger.

142
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,503
Fascinating, isn't it?

143
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,693
- Fascinating?

144
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,423
Are you crazy?

145
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,860
Do you know what you're talking about?

146
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,693
- Relax.

147
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,297
It's just a movie.

148
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,241
- [Elizabeth] A what?

149
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,533
- [Reporter] They are relatively insulated

150
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,721
from the devastation.

151
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:20,554
- A movie.

152
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,983
(plane whooshing)

153
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,150
("Hail to the Chief")

154
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:52,530
There he is, here he comes, here he comes.

155
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,360
Make sure you got him
in camera, Elizabeth.

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,040
- [Elizabeth] This is probably illegal.

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,110
- [Arthur] Exhilarating is
a much better word for it.

158
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,688
Make sure you got him in frame.

159
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:01,950
(soft tense music)

160
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,960
- [Elizabeth] He is the real president.

161
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,170
- [Arthur] He's a public
figure and this is art.

162
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,350
It has to be real or
it won't mean anything.

163
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,060
- And lost inventory.

164
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,190
Homeowners and renters are also eligible

165
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,046
for assistance under SBA-

166
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,174
- [Arthur] Can you see me, Elizabeth?

167
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:18,260
It's not fine!

168
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,412
Lean in.

169
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:20,337
Here.

170
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,350
Up, up, over here.

171
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,280
Good.

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,113
Good.

173
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,300
Good, pan with him over to the right

174
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,839
until you pick me up.

175
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,280
(plane whooshing)

176
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,140
- [Elizabeth] Is your
man supposed to get away?

177
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,603
- [Arthur] How do you know it's a man?

178
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,320
- [Elizabeth] A woman assassin?

179
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,450
- Assassins can come in all sexes.

180
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,180
For example, Sarah Jane Moore missed

181
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,500
because somebody pushed her arm

182
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,333
and Squeaky Fromme,

183
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,380
she didn't know how to cock the gun.

184
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,110
If Rockefeller would've been president,

185
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,720
he would've died later in office.

186
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,700
Think of the chaos that that would've had

187
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,533
for the Republicans.

188
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,280
- [Elizabeth] Is this a
movie about assassination

189
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,240
or about anarchy?

190
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,350
- It's about revenge.

191
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,200
They killed our guys, now we kill theirs.

192
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,130
- [Elizabeth] We?

193
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,780
So this is a conspiracy.

194
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,520
- What do you think we're doing right now?

195
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,320
- [Elizabeth] But we're
only making a movie.

196
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,850
You said that's what we were doing.

197
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,947
- Of course.

198
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,090
But we still are conspirators.

199
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,040
It doesn't matter who pulls the trigger

200
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,140
because he's still our creation.

201
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,653
What? What are you doing?

202
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:21,510
What are you staring at me like that for?

203
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,860
Aim it back at the president.

204
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,787
What are you doing? Pan up at him!

205
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,080
- [Elizabeth] You don't want an actor.

206
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,103
You want a nut!

207
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,880
- Why do I have to do the
dirty work all the time?

208
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,300
Can't you do this for me once in a while?

209
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,236
Can't you handle this for Daddy?

210
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,644
(baby giggles)
Huh?

211
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,174

Lorina, what are you doing?

219
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,459
Get the phone.

220
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,214
- [Lorina] I'm taking a fucking suds bath.

221
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:04,770
What do you think I'm doing?

222
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,090
- You know you'd better
stop cursing like that.

223
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,927
She's gonna know what you're saying

224
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,250
and I don't want her bringing that

225
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,780
to school.
- Hello?

226
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,777
Oh yes, this is Lorina.
- Hi, Miss Rosebowl.

227
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:11,610
- He's right here.
- Here, here's an

228
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,230
effin' apple for you.

229
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,330
- I'm fine. Thank you.

230
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,393
It's Arthur Gwenlyn.

231
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,558
- What the fuck does he want?

232
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:25,961
(jaunty music)

233
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,076
- Hey, Duggo.

234
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:28,500
How are you doing?

235
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,370
- Hey Arthur.

236
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,700
Long time no see.

237
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,950
- Yeah, yeah, great.

238
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,120
I got a new picture I'm doing.

239
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,623
I'm very excited about it.

240
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,563
- Oh yeah?

241
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:37,443
That sounds real good.

242
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,403
- That wasn't Latina, was it?

243
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,190
- Lorina.

244
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,180
- Lorina, sorry.

245
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,140
Right.

246
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,600
Boy, her English has really picked up

247
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,820
since the last time I saw you.

248
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,070
She go to school or what?

249
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,978
- Yeah, she picked it all up from me.

250
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,040
(soft music)

251
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,873
So what's up?

252
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,937
I know you didn't just call to say hello.

253
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:08,157
Uh-huh.

254
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,083
- [Lorina] What does he want?

255
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:25,922
Is it a job?

256
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,090
- From who, Arthur Gwenlyn,

257
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,293
the last communist?

258
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,830
- [Lorina] Come on.

259
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,813
Don't tease me like that, okay?

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,164
Is he going to try to make
your life story again?

261
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:41,037
(soft music)

262
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:44,063
- No, he just wants me to
help him shoot the President.

263
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:46,187
- [Lorina] Of the United States?

264
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,567
- [Duggo] No, of Burger King.

265
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,020
- Burger King?

266
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,153
Why he wants to shoot him?

267
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,400
- He's a whack job.

268
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,113
He wants to stalk Bush around.

269
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,060
- [Lorina] You mean like follow him?

270
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,283
- Yeah, follow him.

271
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,989
You know, just to see if it can be done.

272
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,050
- [Lorina] You can't do that.

273
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,343
You have a baby.

274
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,560
- I don't want you to do that

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,060
even if you don't have a baby.

276
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,490
- Is he serious?

277
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,380
- It's a movie, Lorina.

278
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,880
- What, like "JFK?"

279
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,357
- Yeah, like "JFK."

280
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,101
- How much you get paid?

281
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,210
- Hey, don't get your hopes up.

282
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,617
Remember, Hollywood is full of shit.

283
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:32,200
(jaunty music)

284
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,353
- Pull.

285
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,429
(gun bangs)

286
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,006
I like it.

287
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,910
But does it have to be the president?

288
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,380
- [Arthur] Of the United States, yes.

289
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,213
- Load this.

290
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:05,280
You know, why can't it be

291
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,410
some Banana Republic dictator

292
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,420
or maybe Saddam Hussein?

293
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,593
- He's not the enemy.

294
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,433
- Oh.

295
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,267
You know, this is,

296
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,817
you're gonna cause a lot
of political trouble here.

297
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,530
I'm best friends with Arnold, okay?

298
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,270
He's close to Bush.

299
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,670
I get Christmas cards
from the White House.

300
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,743
- They'll blame me not Robert Davi.

301
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,800
- They're not gonna see you, Arthur.

302
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,850
They're gonna see me.

303
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,210
- I can't get the money without you.

304
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,335
You're the only actor
that doesn't bullshit me.

305
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,673
- There are no actors, only actresses.

306
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,280
How much are you gonna need

307
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,630
to cowboy this whole thing?

308
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,023
- Without you?

309
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:50,849
- Yeah.

310
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,874
- As much as you can manage.

311
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,291
(jaunty music continues)

312
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,353
I'll pay you back with interest.

313
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,453
- Did you see "JFK?"

314
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:11,550
- No, I didn't.

315
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,290
But you know,

316
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,700
I believe there was a conspiracy

317
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,687
and the conservatives
were responsible for it.

318
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,570
You know, just like, like you.

319
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,283
- Oh, that's good, Duggo.

320
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,650
We need someone with your expertise

321
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,390
to make this thing believable.

322
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,285
This is gonna be very real.

323
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:29,190
- You got a name for this movie?

324
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,720
- It's called "Cross Point."

325
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,287
It's cause it's like the
cross point in this guy's life

326
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,880
and like the cross hairs on a gun.

327
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,020
- Yeah but I mean,

328
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,031
do you have a name, you know, a star.

329
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:44,040
(jaunty music continues)

330
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,165
- Oh, no.

331
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:49,171
I'm gonna use all unknowns in this film.

332
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:50,421
- All unknowns.

333
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,733
So what's your budget?

334
00:13:58,306 --> 00:13:59,553
- Well, it's kind of low, you know?

335
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:02,163
It's a personal movie.

336
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,583
- Uh-huh.

337
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,130
So, how much can you pay me?

338
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:18,847
- Hey, I did mean to insult you.

339
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:21,210
How about 250 a week?

340
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,290
- You forgot to say asshole.

341
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,030
How about 250 a week, asshole?

342
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,890
- Look, this isn't Hollywood bullshit.

343
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,540
I'm trying to stay on a tight budget

344
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,800
so I don't have some fucking studio

345
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,540
telling me what I can say.

346
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,980
It's guerilla filmmaking

347
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,170
and I'm giving you a
chance to be part of it.

348
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,100
- I wanna be with gorillas,

349
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,000
I'd go to the zoo.

350
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,730
- All right, I'll give
you part of the profits.

351
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,900
- Profits of what?

352
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,950
The fucking Secret Service

353
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,630
is gonna throw you and the film in jail

354
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,280
as soon as they find out about this.

355
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,470
So you want me, you pay me up front.

356
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,900
Put 10 large on the table and we talk.

357
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,880
- What's 10 large?

358
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,870
- [Duggo] Large.

359
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,010
Thousands.

360
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,843
- 10,000?

361
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:55,230
I don't have 10,000.

362
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,130
- Then how you gonna make this movie

363
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,180
if you don't have 10,000?

364
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,980
- I'm blowing up 16 millimeter.

365
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,680
Most of my expenses are deferments.

366
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,185
- And I drove three hours for this?

367
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:06,602
(soft music)

368
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,203
Now, let me tell you something.

369
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,050
I did see "JFK"

370
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,030
and anybody who believes
it's real is a kook.

371
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,890
You goddamn liberals are all kooks.

372
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,330
That's why I'm a conservative.

373
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,590
And I voted for Bush.

374
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,983
So go and fuck yourself.

375
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,733
(dramatic music)

376
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:38,861
- I would shoot the President
of the United States.

377
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,920
It wouldn't be that hard.

378
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,030
All you need is a gun

379
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,243
and a willingness to
exchange your life for his.

380
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,003
I have that willingness.

381
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm dying anyway.

382
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,270
- [Arthur] Why are you dying?

383
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,600
- I have AIDS.

384
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,340
- [Arthur] I'm sorry to hear that.

385
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,290
How did you get it?

386
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,650
- I don't think that matters to you.

387
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,483
- No, I'm sorry.

388
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,470
That was a stupid question.

389
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,090
Are you upset with the President

390
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,850
about how little he's done to help you?

391
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,683
- Well, yeah.

392
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:11,160
You know, me and a million other people.

393
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,530
I mean, Bush has really got...

394
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,513
Could we stop for a minute here?

395
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,370
- [Arthur] Something wrong?

396
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,618
- Yeah, I'm starting to get scared.

397
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:21,690
- [Arthur] Scared?

398
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,310
Scared of what?

399
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,410
- I mean, what if someone
was to see this tape?

400
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,910
- What do you mean what if?

401
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,930
It's my every intention

402
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,060
that everyone will see this tape.

403
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,500
- Wait a minute.

404
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,610
You're gonna really use

405
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,773
Bush's name in this script, aren't you?

406
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,890
- He uses it. Why shouldn't I?

407
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,990
- Why can't we change
Bush to something else?

408
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,703
I mean, let's call him
Tree or Shrub or something.

409
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,430
- You don't have AIDS.

410
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:50,640
- What?

411
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,260
- The ad said actors who
really have AIDS should apply.

412
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,193
You lied.

413
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:59,250
- (clears the throat) All right, look,

414
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,960
I need this job.

415
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,850
I can play this part.

416
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,563
What's the difference on screen?

417
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,610
- Thanks very much for coming by.

418
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,920
- Boy, you are really fucking weird, man.

419
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,123
Really fucking weird.

420
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,793
- He's right.

421
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,660
- I'm not fucking weird.

422
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,430
Maybe he's talking about you.

423
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,280
- An opportunity for an actor who has AIDS

424
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,470
to get a chance to work is one thing.

425
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,000
But if we can't find the right actor,

426
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
what's wrong with someone
just playing the part?

427
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,950
I mean, it's all the same on screen.

428
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,150
- We agreed to make this real

429
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,100
or not to make it at all.

430
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,400
Let's not start by cheating
on what we believe in.

431
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,140
I mean, if you really
care about the oppressed,

432
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,960
I mean, if you really wanna
change things for them,

433
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,520
why don't you give one
of 'em an opportunity

434
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
he might not get on his own?

435
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,720
- [Elizabeth] That's when I knew he wasn't

436
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,403
talking about making a movie.

437
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,560
I saw it in his eyes.

438
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,730
He was looking for someone

439
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,183
to really shoot the President
of the United States.

440
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,373
- Last week.

441
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,923
A car accident.

442
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,743
No, she's dead too.

443
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,072
I'm his brother

444
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,353
and I can't talk anymore, all right?

445
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,140
- Who is you talking to?

446
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,100
- You scared the shit out of me.

447
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,734
What the fuck is wrong with you?

448
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,452
- Shut up! You'll wake the baby.

449
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:19,860
I heard you telling somebody we was dead.

450
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,423
Who was you talking to?

451
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,259
- They were trying to sell something.

452
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,092
- Bullshit.

453
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:27,688
It was a collection agency, okay?

454
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:28,624
- No.

455
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:30,025
- [Lorina] It was.

456
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,770
- [Duggo] I said it wasn't, didn't I?

457
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,960
- Don't use those forks.

458
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,550
I saved them for company.

459
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,960
Give it to me I said.

460
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,830
- You want the fork?

461
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,663
You want the fork?

462
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:39,843
Here's your fucking fork!

463
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,420
All right?

464
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,923
- You bastard.

465
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,287
(Lorina crying)

466
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:47,560
You break my fork.

467
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,516
I love these forks.

468
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,473
They are a part of my wedding present.

469
00:18:57,308 --> 00:18:58,335
- I'll get you another fork.

470
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,668
- I don't want another fork.

471
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:05,910
- Give me the fork.

472
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,743
I can fix it.

473
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,234
- You can't fix it.

474
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,151
It's broke.

475
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,540
- I can fix it.

476
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,373
Here.

477
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,410
(baby crying)

478
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,303
Here, look.

479
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,023
See?

480
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,670
(soft music)

481
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,970
- [Elizabeth] He keeps interviewing

482
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,880
every kind of radical he can find.

483
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,493
He admits he's not even
looking for actors anymore.

484
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,190
He tells them he's making a movie

485
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,143
about shooting the President.

486
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,233
He found some real dangerous people.

487
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,750
But I don't think he
settled on anybody yet.

488
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:42,667
When he finds the them,

489
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,660
he'll tailor the script
around that person's life

490
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,883
and push him or her right over the edge.

491
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,073
Clever, isn't it?

492
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,970
I mean, he's using the movie idea

493
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,490
to make his own assassin

494
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,900
right out in the open.

495
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:00,870
He keeps rewriting the
script as he goes along.

496
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,310
Whatever happens in real life,

497
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,360
he steals and puts into the movie

498
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,640
or the plan or whatever you wanna call it.

499
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,380
- We have refrigerator.

500
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,930
- Well then you don't need one.

501
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,330
- Why do you need a security deposit?

502
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,100
There is nothing we can break here.

503
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,000
- I gotta have it.

504
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,240
I can help split up for it.

505
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,503
But you gotta put it up.

506
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,570
- Look, it's just us and the baby

507
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,766
and we're not wild or something.

508
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:32,657
We don't have parties or dog or cat.

509
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:34,530
- You can have a dog or a cat.

510
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,820
- [Lorina] Well, we don't.

511
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,917
- You can have a fish or a bird.

512
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,690
You know the small ones.

513
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,400
They don't talk.

514
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,890
- We don't have money for fish or bird.

515
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,210
- [Landlord] You on welfare?

516
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,710
- What?

517
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,050
- [Landlord] The welfare
puts up the security.

518
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,940
- We don't take welfare.

519
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,230
- You wanna look at the single?

520
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,000
- A single?

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,413
We have a baby.

522
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,330
- Well, I don't know what to tell you.

523
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,536
It's up to you.

524
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:02,369
(sirens wailing in distance)

525
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,786
(soft music)

526
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,800
- You feel you're walking on time bombs

527
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,360
waiting for one to go off.

528
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,983
Like this guy Vincent Duggo.

529
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,273
Somebody wrote a book about his life.

530
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,990
In that book he says that in combat,

531
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,400
men dropped death from planes

532
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,700
or fired it from artillery

533
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,163
and never saw their victims.

534
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,767
But not Duggo.

535
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,973
He was a sniper in Vietnam.

536
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,290
He depended mostly on
not leaving any trace

537
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,475
of where he was.

538
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:55,650
(soft music continues)

539
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,890
So he can hide in one place for days,

540
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,490
just waiting for the right time.

541
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,000
If he had to pee,

542
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,450
he did it right in his pants.

543
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,860
He holds one of the highest confirmed

544
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,543
numbers of kills in the war.

545
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,070
Arthur was supposed to
make the book into a movie,

546
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,370
but the deal fell through

547
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,140
and Duggo drifted from job to job

548
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,360
then back into the Marines.

549
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,710
I guess he didn't know
how to do anything else.

550
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,500
When Arthur called Duggo

551
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:28,953
to be a technical advisor,

552
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,730
he didn't know he'd been
discharged from the Marines,

553
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,930
and that he'd lost his house

554
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,730
'cause he couldn't pay the mortgage.

555
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,453
He lives in some dump with his family.

556
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,970
He had to come back to Arthur

557
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,620
just to keep them with groceries.

558
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,970
That cold-hearted son of a bitch

559
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,473
just wrote it in the script.

560
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,337
I thought about leaving him,

561
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,633
but I was frightened.

562
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,663
He is going to kill the President.

563
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,153
If he suspected I knew,

564
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
what would stop him from killing me too?

565
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,095
Do you mind?

566
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,520
- How did you get that
close to the President

567
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,393
at the airport?

568
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,320
- Arthur is a very clever man.

569
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,490
- This ain't no joke, lady.

570
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,750
You understand this?

571
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,570
You're in the hottest
shit you ever stepped in.

572
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,618
- You're forgetting I came to you.

573
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:47,370
- (chuckles) That's
because you're not stupid.

574
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,770
We photographed you at the airport.

575
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,100
You two clowns stood out like a 3D movie.

576
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,288
You saw somebody was taking
your picture, didn't you?

577
00:23:56,288 --> 00:24:00,030
- No, I didn't.

578
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,873
- This script,

579
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,733
it's not finished.

580
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,300
How does he plan to turn
it into the real thing?

581
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,010
- I don't know that part.

582
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,450
- [Agent] Why not?

583
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,743
You know everything else.

584
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,780
- How can I ask him?

585
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,380
He doesn't know I know about it.

586
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,760
- Well, I guess we're gonna have to pay

587
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,790
close attention to the making
of this movie, aren't we?

588
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,623
- What do you mean?

589
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:22,906
You're not gonna stop him?

590
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,840
(soft music)

591
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,673
- No, not yet.

592
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,733
Oh, I can watch him very closely.

593
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,460
I can even detain him as a possible threat

594
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,440
when the President comes to the city.

595
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,600
See, there's no law against making a movie

596
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,250
about an assassination.

597
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,810
- This is not a movie.

598
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,340
It's real.

599
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
- Yeah, but I can't prove that in court.

600
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,930
That is, not without some help.

601
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:57,207
- No, no.

602
00:24:58,154 --> 00:25:00,150
No, I would be too frightened.

603
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,983
- Oh no, no.

604
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:01,833
You'll be just fine.

605
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,160
You do whatever he tells you to do

606
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,860
and then you tell me what that is.

607
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,633
You pick his brain.

608
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,850
You'll be a sounding board.

609
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,570
He's got to slip up sometime.

610
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,710
If we don't get him right,

611
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,600
he'll always be out there.

612
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,463
And I don't like that idea at all.

613
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,413
Don't be afraid.

614
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,543
I'll always be with you.

615
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,273
- Hallelujah.

616
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,193
I'm saved.

617
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,690
(soft music continues)

618
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:42,386
(helicopter whirring)

619
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,838
- [Arthur] That's amazing!

620
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,156
- I know.

621
00:25:56,156 --> 00:26:01,156
Okay, I will mold a C4 high
explosive on the bottom.

622
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,390
The only thing I need to know

623
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,810
is where and when the President will be.

624
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,051
- Why can't I shoot it down?

625
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,000
- Shoot it down?

626
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,250
You wouldn't even see it in time,

627
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,870
let alone hit it.

628
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,324
- I'll get back with you on this.

629
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,157
- Okay.

630
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,880
- Okay. Cut it, cut it.

631
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,276
That was incredible.

632
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:21,131
The way it came down was amazing.

633
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:21,965
Amazing.

634
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:23,095
- Are we breaking down

635
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:23,928
the camera?
- Great, great.

636
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:24,761
- How's the acting?
- Great.

637
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,460
Was that good for the camera?
- Yeah, very good.

638
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,326
- Okay, sound?

639
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:28,617
- That was fine.
- All right, did you get

640
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:29,450
a boom in there?

641
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,169
Was a boom in?
- No boom, I'm sure.

642
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,422
- I don't know.
- I have to find a number

643
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:35,070
to go along with this can.

644
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,900
- Is my accent very heavy?

645
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,210
- You don't have an accent.
- Oh.

646
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,783
- [Elizabeth] Scott,
was the last number 62?

647
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,740
- Look, I don't wanna cut
my own throat over here,

648
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,644
but I don't know what you need me for.

649
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:47,430
(Lahoud speaking foreign language)

650
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,170
- [Arthur] What are you talking about?

651
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,240
- The Air Force flies
a Black Hawk helicopter

652
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
wherever the president is.

653
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,690
It jams radio frequencies for miles.

654
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,160
That thing would spin around like a toy

655
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,810
and drop right back in your lap.

656
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,220
- You're absolutely right.

657
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,100
Okay, that was much too theatrical.

658
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,530
That's why I have you
as my technical advisor.

659
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,970
Next time we'll give them rifles.

660
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,764
- It's why those morons lost the war.

661
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:10,650
(tense music)

662
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,794
- [Elizabeth] Where in hell were you?

663
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,885
You were just supposed to get
a Photo Cam and come back.

664
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:14,718
- [Staff] I went to Photo Cam

665
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,086
and then I went to Magic Filmworks

666
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:17,149
and then I went to Kohling.

667
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:20,346
- Yeah, right.
- I had to help Donna

668
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,110
and I had to help Lisa.

669
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,443
(tense music continues)

670
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:31,785
- Hey, I could use some help over here.

671
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:41,174
(upbeat rock music)

672
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,303
(toilet flushing)

673
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,932
(knocking on door)

674
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:58,033
(knocking on door)

675
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:58,866
- Yes?

676
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:02,019
- Yeah, look, I live down the hall

677
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:02,981
and I was-

678
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,203
(neighbor screams)

679
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:09,611
(Greg speaking foreign language)

680
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:10,737
- Yeah, I live down the hall.

681
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:12,402
I wanted, the music.

682
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:15,022
(Greg speaking foreign language)

683
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,263
- (speaking foreign
language) You know, sleep.

684
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:21,282
(Greg speaking foreign language)

685
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,115
(upbeat rock music continues)

686
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,909
(knocking on door)

687
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,570
- Didn't I tell you to quit
knocking on the door, retard?

688
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,730
- Turn it down. My baby's sleeping.

689
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,203
- Fuck you and your baby.

690
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,620
Come on, motherfucker.

691
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,433
You wanna die?

692
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,333
- Not today.

693
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,220
I'll let you know when.

694
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,020
- Well, I'll be right here, asshole.

695
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,303
Turn the fucking radio up.

696
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:06,600
- [Arthur] Hm.

697
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,820
I don't know if Duggo's thinking right.

698
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,860
This thing's gotta be lighter. Something.

699
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,570
- Hey, excuse me.

700
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,500
What does this look like, a Sears?

701
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,960
I don't do no exchanges.

702
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,010
You don't wanna shoot it,

703
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,660
use it for plumbing.

704
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,850
- Okay, okay, when do we
get the rest of this gun?

705
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,620
- When I get it, I call you.

706
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,880
Same thing with the scope,

707
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,100
which by the way hasn't been that easy.

708
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,360
- [Arthur] Okay, when you call us,

709
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,430
we'll send a guy to pick it up.

710
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,960
- You know I get a lot
of things for people.

711
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,490
I even got a tank for a guy once,

712
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,890
but he looked like he belonged in a tank.

713
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,740
What I don't get is you
and this piece together.

714
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,323
So what are you gonna do with this?

715
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,993
- Deer.

716
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,150
- That's not a gun.

717
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,680
That's artillery.

718
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,760
You hit a deer with that thing,

719
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,100
you won't find an antler to put on a wall.

720
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,210
- Why don't you tell him the truth?

721
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,470
It's for a movie.

722
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,060
- A movie?

723
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,933
Oh shit, a movie?

724
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,833
- Right.

725
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,193
This gun will never be fired.

726
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:02,430
- [Gun Shop Owner] Hey, I'm an actor.

727
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,260
Can I be in your movie?

728
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,540
- [Arthur] Sorry. We're all cast up.

729
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,400
- [Gun Shop Owner] I'll make
a deal with you on the gun.

730
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,221
- [Arthur] Maybe next time.

731
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:13,639
- [Gun Shop Owner] You're
full of shit about a movie.

732
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:17,306
(drill instructor yodeling)

733
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:22,788
- [Drill Instructor]
Left, right, left, right.

734
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,246
Left, right, left.

735
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:28,218
(drill instructor yodeling)

736
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:30,279
(knocking on door)

737
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,190
- Sergeant Major, can I see you a minute?

738
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,293
- Yeah, what is it?

739
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:35,219
Hey, Duggo.

740
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,073
The hell are you doing here?

741
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:38,010
Here, give me a hand here.

742
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,660
- Yes, sir.

743
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,490
- I was wondering if

744
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,100
I could see you in private a minute.

745
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,740
- Well this is as private
as you'll ever catch me.

746
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,823
What's on your mind?

747
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,783
- I need to come back.

748
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,973
I gotta come back.

749
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,643
I came to ask you

750
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:56,880
if you'll make a phone call for me.

751
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,290
Maybe CMC,

752
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,150
maybe, I don't know,

753
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,833
anybody that can help.

754
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,971
- Pizza's hell, ain't it?

755
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:07,350
(helicopter whirring in distance)

756
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,502
You wait a year, you'll
be back in that sandbox.

757
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,520
Come and see me then.

758
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,770
- I can't wait that long.

759
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,633
- What's your hurry?

760
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:15,630
Take some time off.

761
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,950
Relax.

762
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,300
- I don't belong out there.

763
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,510
I don't deserve what happened to me.

764
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,010
- Draw down got a lot of good men.

765
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,300
- [Duggo] Yeah, sure did.

766
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,710
A lot of good men.

767
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,310
- Oh, what makes you so special?

768
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,573
- Nothing.

769
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,020
They're all thinking like me.

770
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,003
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?

771
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,722
- Means we got the shaft with no Vaseline.

772
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,790
- Get the fuck outta here

773
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,620
before I have you arrested for trespassing

774
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,790
on government property.

775
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,020
- I'm a Marine.

776
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,370
- Then do what you have
to to survive like one.

777
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,780
Nothing harder to survive

778
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,230
than not being needed anymore.

- Yeah, Semper Fi, Marine.

(audience cheering)

787
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,820
- I'll be damned if I'm gonna roll over

788
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,490
for a lot of these outrageous charges

789
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,318
that are coming out of the opposition

790
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:17,969
day in and day out.

791
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,723
We don't have to take that.

(tense music)

794
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,497
- [Arthur] And that's
where I want you to be.

795
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:40,907
- [Sibby] Where are you gonna be?

796
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,360
- [Arthur] That's all you gotta know.

797
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,278
Everybody knows just what they have to.

798
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:47,310
- Now you wouldn't be trying to trick me,

799
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,143
now would you, G?

800
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:50,010
- What do you mean trick?

801
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,850
- I mean, how come I feel like

802
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,260
this ain't no movie no more, man,

803
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,363
but somebody forgot to tell me.

804
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,290
- Then I must be doing something right.

805
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,060
That's what you're supposed to feel.

806
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,900
- I know how you told me

807
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,970
how you was going to pull it all together,

808
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,010
but lemme tell you what else
pulls together, homeboy.

809
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,880
See, it pulls together

810
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,680
that I really am African American.

811
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,080
It pulls together that Bush
really is the President.

812
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,480
And it pulls together that
I really don't like him.

813
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,033
And if he was to get shot, really,

814
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,700
and I happen to be

815
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,123
in the wrong place at the right time,

816
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,893
I could make a really cool patsy.

817
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,123
- You have a perfect imagination.

818
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,000
If that's what you think,

819
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,537
why are you here?

820
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:37,053
- Because if I'm right,

821
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,040
this thing is a whole lot
bigger than you and me

822
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,720
and somebody I've been
knowing for 20 years

823
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,113
is liable to come over
to my house and smoke me.

824
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,483
But if I'm wrong,

825
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm out a chance of becoming

826
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,935
a really famous actor.

827
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:54,404
(jaunty music)

828
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:56,336
- Well I have to know now.

829
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,503
Are you in or are you out?

830
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:06,848
- Yo man, I just hope
you need me for part two.

831
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,265
(soft music)

832
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,733
- You wanna come in with me?

833
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,576
- No, I better wait here.

834
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,162
- Okay.

835
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,517
I'll just be a minute.

836
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:47,007
(doorbell rings)

837
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:50,110
(curious music)

838
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,027

839
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:18,908
(curious music continues)

840
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:50,317
(tense music)

841
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,317
- You know, he's the one to worry about.

842
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:56,752
- Gwenlyn's the one to worry about it.

843
00:35:56,752 --> 00:36:00,752
We'll take care of Duggo
when the time is right.

844
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:03,987
- He's coming out.

845

to shoot from here?

856

- [Arthur] Didn't I tell you?

857
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,590
- You don't really tell me much
of anything anymore, Arthur.

858
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,263
- I'm sorry.

859
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,710
I got a lot of my mind.

860
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,170
Yeah, we'll shoot from up here.

861
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,730
- When?

862
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,750
- When the President comes here,

863
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,543
the motorcade will most
probably come right down there.

864
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,860
- What if it doesn't?

865
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,030
- Wherever it is, that's where I'll be.

866
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,143
He can't hide from me.

867
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,963
- When do I get to see
the rest of the script?

868
00:37:32,963 --> 00:37:34,983
I mean, I need to know what to prep.

869
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,080
- I'm doing all the prep.

870
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,780
The rest of the script is up here.

871
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,210
You just be where I need you to be

872
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,280
doing what I tell you to do.

873
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,690
- What about security, Arthur?

874
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,820
I mean, how are you gonna get around that?

875
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,290
- It's not as hard as you think.

876
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,780
The answer's right in front of you.

877
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,340
Would you like to see it?

878
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,420
- No, I don't wanna see it.

879
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,820
I thought I did, but I
really don't want to.

880
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,470
- Why not?

881
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,490
- Arthur, what would it take

882
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,040
for you to give this whole thing up?

883
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,880
- What?

884
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,380
- It's winter in Chile.

885
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,550
The skiing's great.

886
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,010
I'll pay for two weeks at Las Lena's.

887
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,360
I mean, it'll be wonderful, Arthur.

888
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,490
You'll forget about all this.

889
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,290
- Is there something wrong with you?

890
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,236
(knocking on door)

891
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,910
Who could that be?

892
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,830
Latina.

893
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,663
- Lorina.

894
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,010
- [Arthur] Right, sorry, Lorina.

895
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,300
How did you find me here?

896
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,600
- I've got to talk to you.

897
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:34,588
I'm leaving my husband.

898
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:38,169
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

899
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:40,860
- I think it's better for him.

900
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,960
He tell me he wish he don't have me

901
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,763
or the baby to worry about
no more so he can die.

902
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,603
He tell me it is a dream he has,

903
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,213
that one time he kill us.

904
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,270
- Well that's because he still wants you.

905
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,700
His dream is his way of
escaping responsibility.

906
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,710
It's totally normal.

907
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,320
- Killing your family is normal?

908
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,140
You've got to take Vincent off this movie.

909
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,034
- [Arthur] Off the movie?

910
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:14,520
- There is a lot of things
you don't know about him.

911
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,720
- [Elizabeth] Like what?

912
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,640
- Like some of the things he's been doing

913
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,840
A couple of weeks ago,

914
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,280
we were in the apartment

915
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,600
and he was playing with the baby

916
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,490
the way he always does.

917
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,029
You know that, do, do, do, do-do,

918
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:30,747
do-do, do-diddly, do, do, do, do

919
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:31,620
do, do, do.

920
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,110
He keeps doing it and doing it.

921
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,186
I laugh and I say,
"Daddy's crazy, isn't he?

922
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:38,547
(tense music)

923
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:40,830
You got quarters for the laundry?"

924
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,093
But he never answered.

925
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,130
I start to get scared.

926
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,700
His eyes were far away someplace.

927
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,533
Stop it, Venny.

928
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:49,860
What are you doing?

929
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,757
You know what he said to me?

930
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,060
"I just want her to laugh."

931
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,960
Then last week after he
brings home the rifle,

932
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,800
he did something else.

933
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,140
He put cammy stick on his face.

934
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,730
When I ask him why he's doing that,

935
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,613
he said to me,

936
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,237
"It's for the movie."

937
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,240
- But Lorina,

938
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,350
I don't see anything wrong

939
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,360
with his getting into what he's doing.

940
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,180
- He thinks that people
follow him all the time.

941
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,827
- What people?

942
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:20,077
- I don't know.

943
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,285
Men.

944
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:26,163
He says they're from
the defend department.

945
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,700
- [Arthur] You mean the
Department of Defense?

946
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,690
- Yeah, that one.

947
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,590
- Arthur, can't you see?

948
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,820
She's not asking you.

949
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,980
Take him off the goddamn picture.

950
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,910
- What for?

951
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,460
- Do you know why he's not in Marines?

952
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,250
- Something to do with
the military drawdown.

953
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,580
- He had one years to
go before he can retire.

954
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,400
And the military is making excuses

955
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,623
not to pay benefits to a lot of soldier.

956
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,560
They say they overweight

957
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,780
or bad business report

958
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,373
or something stupid like that.

959
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,500
- You guys are getting squeezed out

960
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,560
just like the rest of America
is getting squeezed out.

961
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,140
That's what this whole movie is about.

962
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,380
It's a catharsis for the American nobody.

963
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,213
- No what?

964
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,953
- A cleansing.

965
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:11,220
This country is sick

966
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,920
and it needs to be cleaned out.

967
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,260
- You want to make a cleaning movie,

968
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,273
but maybe Duggo wants to do it real.

969
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:21,060
- [Arthur] What?

970
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,980
- Sometimes he say

971
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,393
is President's fault.

972
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,873
On the secret, he blame him.

973
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,333
He thinks that Bush, how does he say?

974
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,303
- Betrayed the Marines?

975
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,400
- Yeah.

976
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,050
- Where is he now?

977
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,963
- Maybe he come home and get my note.

978
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:49,737
(Duggo crying)

979
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:03,344
(rock music)

980
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:33,325
(rock music continues)

981
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,320
- Duggo isn't paranoid.

982
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,300
The men following him are real.

983
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,013
- Yeah. Who are they?

984
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:47,400
- They're the Secret Service.

985
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,270
- Secret Service?

986
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,103
How do you know that?

987
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:51,600
- Oh damn you, Arthur.

988
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,620
Why are you doing this?

989
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,300
You are never gonna get away with it.

990
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,220
They've known from the start.

991
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,510
- Getaway with what?

992
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,680
- Don't insult me.

993
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,410
I know that you're planning
to kill the President.

994
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,870
- You must be losing your mind.

995
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,970
- I am not losing my mind.

996
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,773
- Well then I'm losing mine!

997
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,920
First an Afro-American actor

998
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,030
who says he's not an actor,

999
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,130
comes to me and says, I'm gonna kill him

1000
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,020
if he doesn't play the role.

1001
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,310
Then Latina,

1002
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,652
I wish she'd change her name,

1003
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:21,720
Lorina comes and says my
tech advisor's flipping out

1004
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,800
and now you come and tell me

1005
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,210
I'm really out to kill Bush

1006
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,193
and the Secret Service knows it.

1007
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,850
- You're not?

1008
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,683
- [Arthur] Oh shit.

1009
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:31,980
This is a meat wagon.

1010
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,270
- [Elizabeth] Oh I hope
he wasn't depressed enough

1011
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,230
to kill himself.

1012
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,430
- [Arthur] He's not the type.

1013
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,010
- [Elizabeth] Oh, and
just who is the type?

1014
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,390
- Residents only. You live here?

1015
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,223
- [Arthur] No, no, but
a friend of mine does.

1016
00:43:40,223 --> 00:43:42,090
- You'll have. to wait outside.

1017
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:42,923
- Was anybody hurt?

1018
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:44,910
- Step outside the marked area, please.

1019
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,123
- I'm outside the area.
- Fine.

1020
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,909
(police radio chattering)

1021
00:43:57,985 --> 00:44:00,818
(neighbor crying)

1022
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,220
- It looks like the head is missing.

1023
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,403
- Don't fuck with me.

1024
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:10,680
- Found this in the sofa.

1025
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,430
- I gotta hear what they're saying.

1026
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:17,196
- I got a better idea.

1027
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,840
- It ain't mine.

1028
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,247
- Man, I ain't seen that stuff before.

1029
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:21,080
- Shut up!
- It ain't my stuff.

1030
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,670
- Listen, you twin pieces of shit!

1031
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,470
Somebody wants to ask you some questions,

1032
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,580
you'd better have some answers.

1033
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,413
You got it?

1034
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:30,270
- [Police Officer] So did you
actually see what happened

1035
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,650
or was your back turned?

1036
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,580
- [Suspect] Look at my fucking shirt.

1037
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,620
Does it look like my back was turned?

1038
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,760
- Look, asshole.

1039
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,753
- Fuck you!

1040
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,840
- [Officer] Standing around
in a circle smoking a joint

1041
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,670
and the window was open.

1042
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,040
- [Suspect] Yeah, we were
sitting facing the window

1043
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,440
and Greg was facing us.

1044
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,273
- [Suspect 2] Yeah, you know,

1045
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:48,780
we're just like having a good time, right?

1046
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,550
And I'm, and I'm getting
ready to tell Greg,

1047
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,380
don't burn that sucker too long.

1048
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,023
All of a sudden I hear
this quick kind of like

1049
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:55,980
(gun pops)

1050
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,840
Greg's head fucking head just exploded.

1051
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,340
- Quit that. Put the mic back.

1052
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,710
- All right. Thanks very much.

1053
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,893
- Get these pieces of shit out of here.

1054
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:08,373
- All right, let's go, move.

1055
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,130
- You know, gentlemen,

1056
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,260
we made a thorough search
of the opposite building

1057
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,150
and there is no place that a sniper

1058
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,370
can perch himself to
that line of trajectory.

1059
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,720
- Yeah, that seems to be a problem.

1060
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,440
- And how do you silence a
high powered rifle anyway?

1061
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,340
- Fortunately, Detective,

1062
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,780
that's your problem, not ours.

1063
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,030
So you have a nice night.

1064
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:29,887
(sirens wailing)

1065
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,370
- Those guys aren't regular cops.

1066
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,170
They're Secret Service, aren't they?

1067
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,540
- Yes.

1068
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,373
- When?

1069
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,070
- You saw them taking our
picture at the airport

1070
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,540
and you still wouldn't stop.

1071
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,460
I thought you'd gone crazy.

1072
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,040
- Well, that's the end of this movie.

1073
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,660
- I can talk to them.

1074
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,093
- What? Tell 'em what?

1075
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:51,000
That you made a mistake?

1076
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,170
- Yes!

1077
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,790
They only believed what I told them

1078
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,660
and what they wanted to.

1079
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,610
I can convince them they're wrong.

1080
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,620
- You forget I made Duggo a killer.

1081
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,300
He's my creation, as I said.

1082
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,060
- Duggo was a killer.

1083
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,280
You asked for a prop and
you got a live grenade.

1084
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,103
It's not your fault.

1085
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,240
(police radio chattering)

1086
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,190
- They'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

1087
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,497
Tell them you told me everything

1088
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:15,453
and I decided to drop the movie.

1089
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,412
Tell them you know nothing about tonight.

1090
00:46:19,412 --> 00:46:22,620
(soft music)

1091
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,453
- Look at me.

1092
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,230
Do you mean it about the movie?

1093
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,290
- It's not that important anymore.

1094
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,372
What matters now is Duggo.

1095
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:34,205
- Yes.

1096
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:40,407
- I'll get you a cab.

1097
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:41,970
You wait by those cops.

1098
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,596
You'll be safe.

1099
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:46,204
- What are you gonna do?

1100
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,954
- I know where he is.

1101
00:46:49,151 --> 00:46:49,984
(tense music)

1102
00:46:49,984 --> 00:46:52,484
Duggo, I know you're up there.

1103
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:55,720
I wanna help you.

1104
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:04,767
Duggo?

1105
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,890
(gun clicking)

1106
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,510
A bullet fired

1107
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,940
from a high powered rifle

1108
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,900
can't be silenced

1109
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,333
because it breaks the sound barrier.

1110
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,720
So you shoot from far enough away

1111
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,703
that the sound can't reach the target.

1112
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,053
You taught me that a long time ago.

1113
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,463
I'm alone.

1114
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,399
Can I turn around?

1115
00:47:36,399 --> 00:47:38,899
(tense music)

1116
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:53,460
- The cab driver who dropped you off

1117
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,010
told us where he picked you up.

1118
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,760
Now, where's Arthur?

1119
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,573
- Duggo's sick.

1120
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,320
Arthur had nothing to do with it.

1121
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,603
- Oh, I see.

1122
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:19,290
- What I believed was my own mistake

1123
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,583
and my embarrassment.

1124
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,113
I realize I have a big imagination.

1125
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,750
He told me I was wrong and I believe him.

1126
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:33,270
(tense music)

1127
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,790
- How'd you know where to find me?

1128
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,170
- I just followed the line of sight

1129
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,170
from your building to the highest point.

1130
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,390
I knew it was up here.

1131
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,913
I just had to wait till
my nerves calmed down.

1132
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,657
- And what do you want?

1133
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:50,760
- I wanna show you how to get outta here.

1134
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,110
You know, go down this
mountain free as a bird.

1135
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,283
- Yeah.

1136
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,083
How?

1137
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,810
- Just walk, same way you came up.

1138
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:03,540
- You forgot to say asshole.

1139
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,860
- No.

1140
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,780
Nobody knows how you did it.

1141
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,580
They don't even know it was you.

1142
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,890
Even those two greasy friends
of the guy you killed.

1143
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,390
They didn't even think of you.

1144
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:14,582
Nobody knows.

1145
00:49:14,582 --> 00:49:15,915
You can go home.

1146
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:20,640
- You know.

1147
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:27,145
(couple moaning enthusiastically)

1148
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:40,623
- You son of a bitch.

1149
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,230
- Don't be embarrassed, Elizabeth.

1150
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,063
That's not you.

1151
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,380
It's the waitress at the Angelique.

1152
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,130
We thought she might be
connected to his plan,

1153
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,690
but she isn't.

1154
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,760
Though he did say he was
planning to get away for a while.

1155
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,593
Maybe Chile.

1156
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,810
He asked her to go with him.

1157
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:58,743
She said yes.

1158
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,080
- Is there something you want?

1159
00:50:07,746 --> 00:50:08,579
- No.

1160
00:50:09,918 --> 00:50:12,168
I think of you as a friend.

1161
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,553
- He lies to you, Elizabeth.

1162
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:22,950
- Then why don't you arrest him?

1163
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,480
- So I need the attempt

1164
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,403
and I need you to tell me his plan.

1165
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,650
I don't want to have to worry about

1166
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,950
Arthur in some other city.

1167
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,420
- There is not going
to be an assassination.

1168
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,803
So please go get laid.

1169
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,530
- Would you like to bet he'll tell you

1170
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,243
he's still gonna make the movie?

1171
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,670
- I'd love to.

1172
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,770
What do you wanna bet?

1173
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,876
- All right guys. That's it.

1174
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,376
(tense music)

1175
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,833
Duggo.

1176
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,160
- What?

1177
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,440
- You asked me what I wanted to bet.

1178
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,060
- I don't understand.

1179
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,730
- He killed a sleazy drug dealer.

1180
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,383
It's really none of our business.

1181
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,533
And the locals will never figure it out,

1182
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,440
but we could help them.

1183
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,080
- What are you trying to say?

1184
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,030
- If I'm wrong,

1185
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,563
I'll be happy to go on my way.

1186
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,793
I'll forget about Arthur
and Duggo can go free.

1187
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,940
- And if I'm right,

1188
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,610
you won't have anything on Arthur anyway.

1189
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,810
And what makes you think
I care about Duggo?

1190
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:31,655
- Then don't take the deal.

1191
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,808
- I saw this show once.

1192
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,790
(soft music)

1193
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:44,590
It was a documentary about this wolf pack

1194
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,750
that these ranchers were
chasing with a helicopter.

1195
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,173
The wolves were killing their cattle.

1196
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,990
So the ranchers were shooting
them down in the snow.

1197
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,123
The wolves kept running.

1198
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,090
They were trying to make
it to a forest up ahead.

1199
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,760
But they kept, you know,

1200
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,483
getting picked off one by one.

1201
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,020
Finally there was only one wolf left

1202
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,393
and he kept zigzagging,

1203
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:33,803
thinking,

1204
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,380
ducking, moving.

1205
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,290
You couldn't help

1206
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,933
cheering for that son
of a bitch to make it.

1207
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:48,540
- Well, did he make it?

1208
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,303
- Yeah, he made it.

1209
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:55,560
- [Arthur] Great. I'm glad to hear it.

1210
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,393
- Why?

1211
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,190
- Because he lived.

1212
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,123
He survived.

1213
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,373
He beat all the odds.

1214
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,850
It's the part that we
like to see in ourselves.

1215
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,143
That's why you cheered.

1216
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,260
- And now I'll tell you
the part you don't see

1217
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,883
when the documentary finished.

1218
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,263
You don't see one of a
kind who grows old alone,

1219
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,360
who struggles to eat because

1220
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,620
he doesn't know how to
hunt without his pack.

1221
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,150
You don't see the wolf

1222
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,513
who wondered what he won by living.

1223
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,650
He would've been better
off if he wasn't so good.

1224
00:53:38,596 --> 00:53:41,763
(helicopter whirring)

1225
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:57,252
(tense music)

1226
00:54:04,313 --> 00:54:07,813
(owl hooting in distance)

1227
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,487
How'd you like to make
the film of a lifetime?

1228
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,680
If your people were along any route,

1229
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,582
this would still be the safety perimeter.

1230
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:35,313
- Duggo, I've stood next to the President.

1231
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,853
There's so much power in that spot.

1232
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,160
You'll never get out alive.

1233
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:46,080
(tense music continues)

1234
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,680
- This is what I want you to do.

1235
00:54:52,395 --> 00:54:55,562
(helicopter whirring)

1236
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,180
- November 25, Alpha Juliet to operation.

1237
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,580
- [Operator] Go ahead
November 25, Alpha Juliet.

1238
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,780
- Still negative contact.

1239
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,740
I've been a sitting duck

1240
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,290
out here all morning with no visual.

1241
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,520
If he's still here,

1242
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,770
he hasn't taken the bait.

1243
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,760
- You really believe the Secret Service

1244
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,500
is gonna forget about Duggo and me?

1245
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,333
Right!

1246
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,758
Don't worry about it, Elizabeth.

1247
00:55:21,758 --> 00:55:23,820
Duggo is my friend.

1248
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,909
He's more important than my politics.

1249
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,750
(tense music)

1250
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,070
We did look a little suspicious.

1251
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,560
I mean, we saw him take
our picture at the airport.

1252
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,120
But look, hey, it's just a movie.

1253
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,590
I'm no real threat to the President.

1254
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,760
I mean, but we're at the airport,

1255
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,590
There are Secret Service all around us,

1256
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,180
and I'm going, "Squeaky Fromme,

1257
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,260
she didn't know how to cock the gun.

1258
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,570
Sarah Jane Moore,
somebody pushed her arm."

1259
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:43,403
Okay?

1260
00:55:43,403 --> 00:55:46,230
I mean, I'm talking about
assassinating the President,

1261
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,900
but I can't say it 'cause all
the Secret Service around.

1262
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,010
So I just keep going on

1263
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,050
and then we add the sound later.

1264
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,400
And my cinematographer, Elizabeth,

1265
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,230
we had that on again,
off again relationship.

1266
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,063
She gets scared.

1267
00:55:56,063 --> 00:55:58,740
She goes and tells him I'm
really gonna kill Bush.

1268
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,573
Don't get upset.

1269
00:55:59,573 --> 00:56:00,406
I already handled that.

1270
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:01,320
I already straightened it out.

1271
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,753
I told her to go back
and tell 'em I'm not,

1272
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,963
which I'm really not.

1273
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,390
This thing is turning out

1274
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,313
much better than I ever expected.

1275
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,840
Thank you very much, Mr Davi.

1276
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,423
(jaunty music)

1277
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,733
- What?

1278
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:27,300
- Duggo will play the main character.

1279
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,380
- I just finished telling them

1280
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,213
that we're not making this movie.

1281
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:30,810
- No, we're gonna shoot Duggo

1282
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,090
as his life is happening now.

1283
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,080
- Arthur, you don't know

1284
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,520
what you're getting yourself into.

1285
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,480
- Yes, I do.

1286
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,280
- Arthur, if you love me,
you're gonna quit this.

1287
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,276
- I do, but I can't.

1288
00:56:40,276 --> 00:56:42,442
(Arthur grunts)
- That's for the waitress!

1289
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,859
(soft music)

1290
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:50,387
(train horn blaring)

1291
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:52,973
They'll kill you if you
go through with this.

1292
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:54,257
- [Duggo] I'm making a movie.

1293
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:55,618
Tell them that.

1294
00:56:55,618 --> 00:56:57,515
- I'm so tired of this shit, Duggo.

1295
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:59,700
You can't leave your family like this.

1296
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,020
- You'll be safe.

1297
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,490
And this movie will make you

1298
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:06,310
the most famous movie
photographer in the world.

1299
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,893
- Can any of you imagine
what it would be like to have

1300
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,713
recorded the real assassination of JFK

1301
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:20,643
or Robert Kennedy or Martin Luther King?

1302
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,820
That's what our movie

1303
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,720
is gonna look like when we're through.

1304
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,130
I'm gonna have a shot of each of you

1305
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,110
and the presidential motorcade

1306
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,463
all in the same shot.

1307
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,660
The presidential motorcade

1308
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,650
will have to slow down

1309
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,230
when it makes its turn
onto Olympic Boulevard,

1310
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,170
heading south to get to
the President's hotel.

1311
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:46,740
Sibby will be in the
second floor hotel here.

1312
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,450
Lahoud and Haddad

1313
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:51,180
will be in the multi-level garage here,

1314
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,190
and Duggo will be in the Lowe Apartments

1315
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,260
on Chesterfield Avenue.

1316
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,780
Morgana will be located
on the corner here,

1317
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,680
able to signal where everyone can see her

1318
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,313
when the motorcade passes
by the intersection.

1319
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,793
I'll be at my hotel on the fifth floor.

1320
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:09,630
(jaunty music)

1321
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,180
- Yo man, you'll never
get us past security.

1322
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,320
- You're talking to me.

1323
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,450
- Yes, but this time we'll have rifles.

1324
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,440
- No guns.

1325
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,360
When the President is gone,

1326
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,193
then we'll come back,

1327
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:21,813
we'll shoot closeups
where you will have guns.

1328
00:58:27,282 --> 00:58:29,220
(tense music)

1329
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,053
- Excuse me.

1330
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,600
Everybody can read the newspaper

1331
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,250
and find out what week

1332
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,600
the President will be here.

1333
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,300
But nobody, I mean, nobody

1334
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,420
tell you what day and where he gonna be.

1335
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,540
So by the time we see it on the news,

1336
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,146
he already gone.

1337
00:58:47,146 --> 00:58:47,979
How do you know?

1338
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:49,920
- [Haddad] He's not going to tell us that.

1339
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,340
But why you give us rifle
instead of our helicopter?

1340
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,590
- Duggo said it's not believable.

1341
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,110
And as for when the president is coming,

1342
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,820
I told you before we began,

1343
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,990
I can make this film

1344
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,640
because I have ways of finding out

1345
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,143
when the President arrives.

1346
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,657
And I only give two hours notice.

1347
00:59:07,657 --> 00:59:08,637
If you don't like it,

1348
00:59:08,637 --> 00:59:11,190
you guys can try to
find out when he comes.

1349
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,810
I'm gonna have two cameras that day

1350
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,250
and I'm gonna cover who I need to

1351
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,320
with the motorcade and when.

1352
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,153
Except for Sibby.

1353
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,360
He'll turn on his own camera

1354
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,183
and sit in front of it
as the motorcade goes by.

1355
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,430
- [Haddad] I still think the helicopter

1356
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,840
will be better for the audience.

1357
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,970
- [Arthur] Well you show
me how it'll get past

1358
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:29,220
that Black Hawk helicopter flying overhead

1359
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,600
and I'll put it back in.

1360
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,159
- [Haddad] But, come
on. It's only a movie.

1361
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:34,140
(knocking on door)

1362
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,490
- Who knew we are here?

1363
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,673
- Nobody. We kept everything secret.

1364
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:41,100
(knocking on door)

1365
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,453
- Everybody stay put.

1366
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,333
- Hey, remember me?

1367
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,333
- Yeah.

1368
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,720
You read for us a couple months ago.

1369
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,280
- That's absolutely right.

1370
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,170
- How did you find us?

1371
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,433
- Well, can I come in?

1372
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,483
Hey, how you doing?

1373
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,030
- What do you want?

1374
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,620
- Same thing I wanted before.

1375
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,850
A job.

1376
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,770
- I told you you weren't right.

1377
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,623
- Oh, and you're gonna
tell me those people are.

1378
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:20,790
I mean, no offense to anybody,

1379
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,890
but I can do this job
as good as any of them.

1380
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,690
I just need the chance to prove it.

1381
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,220
- I've already cast the movie.

1382
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:29,340
- Look, you think this was
easy for me to come down here?

1383
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,600
I've been busting my to get ass

1384
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,060
to get a lousy job and
I ain't got no luck.

1385
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,623
I ain't worked in a year.

1386
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,770
- I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

1387
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,360
- I got a 14 month old daughter.

1388
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,410
She's very sick.

1389
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,730
It's something with her lungs.

1390
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,760
Now please, goddamn it, I need this job.

1391
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,830
I need to get my SAG insurance back.

1392
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,270
I can't afford the bills.

1393
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,863
I will do anything.

1394
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,530
- I'm sorry, but I just don't have

1395
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,510
anything for you to do.

1396
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:55,343
- Come on, Arthur.

1397
01:00:55,343 --> 01:00:56,253
He's got a sick kid.

1398
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,860
- Come on.

1399
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,200
I thought we were all liberals here, huh?

1400
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,880
- Bite your tongue, Miss.

1401
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,680
- Maybe you could find a way to use him.

1402
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,013
I mean, isn't that what
you're doing with all of us?

1403
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,950
- Now, look, it doesn't
have to be as an actor.

1404
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:14,040
I could make a movie of
how you made the movie.

1405
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,830
Just put me under SAG so
I can get my insurance.

1406
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,170
- What do you know about making movies?

1407
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,910
- I've been taping you all along.

1408
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:21,930
- What?

1409
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,940
- Yeah, I mean, I've been
following you every place.

1410
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,250
I've been on rooftops, climbed trees,

1411
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,660
been in park vans many a times.

1412
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,910
You never even knew I was there.

1413
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,533
- You put my movie on tape?

1414
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,630
- Well, I mean, the sound isn't that hot,

1415
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:38,130
but I heard you and the acting was great.

1416
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,933
I just kept reaching for popcorn.

1417
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,540
Oh, and I love that helicopter

1418
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,880
that's supposed to be
carrying C4 explosives

1419
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,760
and how it's going to ram into
the president's limousine.

1420
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,560
You know, ba-boom!

1421
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,993
Be a big hole where that car was.

1422
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,483
- Where is this tape?

1423
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,120
- Safe.

1424
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,680
Wouldn't want the Secret
Service to get ahold of it.

1425
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,437
I hear they got a lousy sense of humor.

1426
01:02:01,437 --> 01:02:04,770
(tense music continues)

1427
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,100
- What's your name?

1428
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,933
- Eric.

1429
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:09,960
Eric Clancy.

1430
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,450
I got my picture and resume in the car.

1431
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:13,600
- Eight by 10s?
- Yep.

1432
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:19,710
- Well everybody meet our
new documentary maker, Eric.

1433
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,820
He's gonna make a movie

1434
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,473
about the making of our movie.

1435
01:02:26,465 --> 01:02:30,715
(Haddad speaking foreign language)

1436
01:02:45,032 --> 01:02:49,282
(Lahoud speaking foreign language)

1437
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,174
(knocking on door)

1438
01:03:01,174 --> 01:03:03,390
- What? What are you doing?

1439
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,100
- [Duggo] Why do you hang up on me?

1440
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,933
- Go away!

1441
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:07,263
I don't know where she is.

1442
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,263
Who are you?

1443
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,980
- [Duggo] I want my baby.

1444
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,813
- Get out of here.

1445
01:03:11,813 --> 01:03:13,701
I don't know where she is.

1446
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:14,534
Go away.

1447
01:03:16,682 --> 01:03:18,643
(Victor speaking foreign language)

1448
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:19,890
- Get out of here!

1449
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,270
- You hiding them from me?

1450
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:23,100
Tell me where my family is!

1451
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,011
(tense music)

1452
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,281
- [Delia] You're crazy!

1453
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:27,400
Go away! I call the police.

1454
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,283
- Looks like he's going to punch her.

1455
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:33,420
I can get him clean right now.

1456
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,680
- No good.

1457
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,440
It's gotta be an immediate
threat to her life.

1458
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,689
- Say when and he's yours.

1459
01:03:39,689 --> 01:03:43,856
(Duggo speaking foreign language)

1460
01:03:46,145 --> 01:03:50,128
(Delia speaking foreign language)

1461
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:51,360
- Hey, watch the camera.

1462
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,593
- Watch out for me!

1463
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:58,697
(dog barking in distance)

1464
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,600
- Arthur, stop him, will you?

1465
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,433
- Keep rolling.

1466
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:08,310
Keep the camera rolling.

1467
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,483
- I brought you here.

1468
01:04:11,483 --> 01:04:13,090
Is this how you pay me back?

1469
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,810
(Delia crying)

1470
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,643
- Damn!

1471
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,293
- Hey, hey. What's up?

1472
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,350
Not much. Good to see you.

1473
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:26,887
- Yeah.
- There it is.

1474
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,433
- Who's name did you use?

1475
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,893
- Not mine. (laughs)

1476
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,383
Check it out.

1477
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:38,480
This is just like Dallas
right here with a twist.

1478
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,252
(Morgana laughs)

1479
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:43,650
Boom!

1480
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,647
- Did you tell him?

1481
01:04:45,717 --> 01:04:46,550
- No.

1482
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:50,382
He'll go for it.

1483
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,040
- Yeah man, this looks real nice.

1484
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,450
- Nice.

1485
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,550
You can see a fly at 2000 meters

1486
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,520
and swear he was passing
around a few notes.

1487
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,320
The optics are my own development
with a patent pending.

1488
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,410
- When will it be finished?

1489
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,640
- Eh, need three more days.

1490
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,373
Some minor puffing,
final calibration test.

1491
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:17,310
- See you in three days.
- Good.

1492
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,530
But I'll need the rest of the bread now.

1493
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:21,720
- Oh yo, it's COD, homes.

1494
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,193
- What the fuck is this home?

1495
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:24,780
I am not your homie,

1496
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,207
but I don't know what shit
you are up to with this.

1497
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:29,730
You might be hunted by the police already.

1498
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,893
What if you get busted
and don't come back?

1499
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,280
What am I going to do with it?

1500
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,470
No, I want the rest of my money now

1501
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,120
or you'll find somebody
else to make your fucking-

1502
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,470
- Hey, hey, yo, look man,

1503
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,270
all I know is my man
told me to come down here

1504
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,103
and pick it up, okay?

1505
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,150
I don't pick it up, I don't got no job.

1506
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,463
- Tell your fucking
man to come in himself.

1507
01:05:45,686 --> 01:05:46,710
- Okay.

1508
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,693
Okay, that's cool, man.

1509
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,590
How about we do this?

1510
01:05:58,903 --> 01:06:00,932
You seen "Marathon Man" motherfucker?

1511
01:06:00,932 --> 01:06:02,025
- Okay.

1512
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:03,456
Okay, COD, homie.

1513
01:06:03,456 --> 01:06:04,289
COD.

1514
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:06,201
- [Arthur] Cut.

1515
01:06:06,201 --> 01:06:07,034
Good.

1516
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,238
(jaunty music)

1517
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:09,207
- You okay?

1518
01:06:09,207 --> 01:06:12,793
- Yes, I think you broke my fucking nose.

1519
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:13,711
- [Elizabeth] It was very good.

1520
01:06:13,711 --> 01:06:14,607
I liked it lot.
- Thank you.

1521
01:06:14,607 --> 01:06:15,924
That good for sound?

1522
01:06:15,924 --> 01:06:17,078
- [Elizabeth] Very good.

1523
01:06:17,078 --> 01:06:18,317
- [Sibby] Man, that shit was real.

1524
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:19,503
- Great, really great.

1525
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:23,135
- That really went back like that, man.

1526
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:24,994
- I can't believe I didn't break his nose.

1527
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:27,744
(all chattering)

1528
01:06:30,007 --> 01:06:30,840
(tense music)

1529
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,867
- [Elizabeth] Has anybody seen my lighter?

1530
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:34,700
- [Arthur] All right,

1531
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,420
everybody take about a 10 minute break.

1532
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,090
I have to make an important phone call.

1533
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,635
Was that good for you, Duggo?

1534
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:41,468
- Yeah.

1535
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:45,660
It's only a movie.

1536
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,920
- Arthur knows the President

1537
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,990
is coming here to campaign tomorrow.

1538
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,706
This is his layout for the route.

1539
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,410
(cheerful carnival music)

1540
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,390
You only have three
choices from the airport.

1541
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,010
They all have to pass by this point.

1542
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:56,910
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1543
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,395
What else?

1544
01:06:58,395 --> 01:06:59,700
- He thinks he's being set up.

1545
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,540
- What do you mean set up?

1546
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,580
- Sibby and Morgana.

1547
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,530
They're getting very close.

1548
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,710
Arthur's nicknamed them
nitro and glycerin.

1549
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:08,610
Harmless alone,

1550
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,450
but he thinks together

1551
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,440
they might try something

1552
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,750
as the motorcade passes tomorrow.

1553
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,220
- You expect me to believe that Arthur

1554
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,360
will have nothing to do with this?

1555
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,182
It was his idea to use the umbrella.

1556
01:07:17,182 --> 01:07:19,843
- No, it was Morgana's.

1557
01:07:19,843 --> 01:07:23,160
She thought that it would
be great for the movie

1558
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,050
if they used the President's alma mater

1559
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,390
as the assassination signal.

1560
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:28,443
Arthur agreed.

1561
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:30,780
But now he thinks Morgana

1562
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,760
really may be trying to signal Sibby.

1563
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,090
- Come on.

1564
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,970
Can't you see he's using you?

1565
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,503
- Look who's talking!

1566
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,950
- Hey, thanks pal.

1567
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,630
- Hey, didn't you forget something?

1568
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,560
- What?

1569
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,637
- Did you wanna pay me?

1570
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:45,960
- Oh, shit.

1571
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,793
Oh, I'm sorry.

1572
01:07:46,793 --> 01:07:47,910
I got a lot on my mind today.

1573
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:48,750
How much I owe you?

1574
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,710
- Nine even.

1575
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:50,543
- Nine even.

1576
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,700
- You want a hand with that?

1577
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,533
- No, no, no.

1578
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:55,366
I got it, I got it.

1579
01:08:07,058 --> 01:08:07,950
(vendor whistles)

1580
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,873
- Secret. You're with Secret Service?

1581
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,113
- Yep.

1582
01:08:12,113 --> 01:08:13,500
That is no secret to you, huh?

1583
01:08:14,607 --> 01:08:15,660
10. Keep the change.

1584
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,890
- Hey, thanks a lot.

1585
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,260
Hey look, I got a 20
here I got from this guy.

1586
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,220
It looks a little funny.
- No, no, no.

1587
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,150
Don't show me that 20.

1588
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,920
If that 20 is bad, I gotta keep it.

1589
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,940
You try the bank.

1590
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,310
If the bank don't catch it, they eat it.

1591
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,660
- Right. Hey, thanks a lot.

1592
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:33,460
(Eric laughing)

1593
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,360
- That son of a bitch is
setting me up to be the patsy.

1594
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,890
Can you imagine that?

1595
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:40,187
I mean, what makes him
think I wouldn't catch on?

1596
01:08:40,187 --> 01:08:41,040
(tense music)

1597
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,273
- I don't know. He must be crazy.

1598
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:43,760
- Now, the part that gets me the most

1599
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,830
is he didn't even care I
told him I had a sick baby.

1600
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:49,560
That son of bitch a didn't
care about anything.

1601
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,820
- What makes you think you're the patsy?

1602
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,143
- Well, it's pure Oswaldism.

1603
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:56,373
- It's what?

1604
01:08:58,278 --> 01:09:00,093
- It's pure Oswaldism.

1605
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,913
- Which means what?

1606
01:09:01,913 --> 01:09:06,450
- Well we know he's motivated

1607
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,762
by some sick kind of revenge, right?

1608
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:11,100
And he believes Oswald's a patsy

1609
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,930
set up by the real killers.

1610
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,633
So he's gonna create his own Oswald.

1611
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,320
You know, he's gonna
follow the Warren Report

1612
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,490
like a fucking mandate,

1613
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,990
you know, use it like some
kind of poetic justice.

1614
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,810
He's gonna push Duggo into
shooting the President,

1615
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:28,900
letting him believe he
can get away with it

1616
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,950
while Gwenlyn sets up some
lone nut to take the fall.

1617
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,900
You know, some obsessed actor

1618
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,450
who flipped out from his movie.

1619
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:38,700
He used to be one of the others before.

1620
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,533
Now it's me.

1621
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,393
Oh.

1622
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,460
I managed to borrow this from wardrobe.

1623
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,370
Look at that.

1624
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,304
- Sure. That's the modern day Oswald.

1625
01:09:49,304 --> 01:09:51,480
(tense music continues)

1626
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,130
- Quite an image for the news, huh?

1627
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:53,963
- Yeah.

1628
01:09:53,963 --> 01:09:56,220
Probably get more air play
than the Rodney King video.

1629
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,540
- And you can bet that that's the rifle

1630
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:01,773
that Duggo's gonna use.

1631
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,093
Now listen, Chief, you gonna eat that dog?

1632
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,393
- She blinks when she lies.

1633
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,300
- What?

1634
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,133
- Elizabeth.

1635
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,390
I can tell by her eyes

1636
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:17,010
if she's telling the truth,

1637
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,010
and I've been studying her very closely.

1638
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:23,910
- Chief, the key here is distance.

1639
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:26,070
We know that about Duggo.

1640
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:27,620
Everything else is a diversion.

1641
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,853
- Just a slight blink.

1642
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,410
- [Arthur] He wanted to
know where Duggo would be.

1643
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,930
He wasn't interested in anybody else.

1644
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,670
- That's what I expected.

1645
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,710
- Do you really think you're being set up,

1646
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,548
or did you just want me
to tell that to Granger?

1647
01:10:43,548 --> 01:10:45,780
- Sibby's tripod's thick enough

1648
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,780
to convert one of the legs into a rifle.

1649
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,000
- Then why don't you ask to see it?

1650
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,290
- If I'm right, you think he'd let me

1651
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,840
with the President coming tomorrow?

1652
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,490
It's funny, when I first met him,

1653
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:59,080
he was the one who didn't trust me.

1654
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,510
You still don't trust me.

1655
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:04,893
I mean, not really.

1656
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:07,164
Do you?

1657
01:11:07,164 --> 01:11:09,664
(tense music)

1658
01:11:13,706 --> 01:11:16,456
(device beeping)

1659
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:19,643
- Yes, Mr. President.

1660
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:21,750
I'm looking at the route as we speak.

1661
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:25,260
Yes, I've been over it a
thousand times, maybe more.

1662
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,900
No one knows this route better than I do.

1663
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,613
I know every crevice, every nook.

1664
01:11:30,839 --> 01:11:32,730
No, no, no, no, Mr. President.

1665
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,620
You can't say nook and cranny.

1666
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,870
No, no, not in this case.

1667
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,720
Cause you would be thinking conventional

1668
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,580
and Arthur Gwenlyn is counting on that.

1669
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,000
Yes, he plans to pull this off

1670
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,980
right under our noses.

1671
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,883
And he knows that we
think in a certain way.

1672
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,820
So it's very important that we know

1673
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,833
every crevice and every nook.

1674
01:11:56,919 --> 01:11:59,130
Are you following me now, sir?

1675
01:11:59,130 --> 01:11:59,963
Yes.

1676
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:02,943
Never get the impression
that you're not secure.

1677
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,400
The last thing I would do

1678
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,200
is put you in a vulnerable position.

1679
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,420
Well, thank you, sir.

1680
01:12:10,588 --> 01:12:13,108
(device beeping)

1681
01:12:13,108 --> 01:12:16,441
(tense music continues)

1682
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,360
Yes, goodnight, Mr. President.

1683
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,010
Is someone there?

1684
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:29,730
(gun clicks)

1685
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:30,980
I said is somebody there?

1686
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:41,623
How'd you get in here?

1687
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,413
- Did I catch you at a bad time?

1688
01:12:43,413 --> 01:12:46,830
Have you ever really fired that at anyone

1689
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,473
or do you just like to wave it around?

1690
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,130
- Where did you get these?

1691
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,540
- You think you're the only one

1692
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,950
who can record someone's life?

1693
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,050
I mean, you're in Hollywood.

1694
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,523
We do it all the time here.

1695
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,730
- [Mistress] I'm tired of
being your goddamn mistress.

1696
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:06,003
Either you tell your
wife about us or I will.

1697
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,690
(couple moaning)

1698
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,040
- Who do you have with you?

1699
01:13:13,647 --> 01:13:16,620
All right, bring in that tape or I'll-

1700
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:17,453
- You'll what?

1701
01:13:17,453 --> 01:13:19,230
Get up and chase him?

1702
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:21,630
How does it feel to be vulnerable?

1703
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,793
- Get outta here while I get dressed.

1704
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,190
- [Elizabeth] I didn't
put you in this position.

1705
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,780
You did it to yourself.

1706
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,993
- Well, it's ridiculous.

1707
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:29,826
- Is it?

1708
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,580
You could have ended this whole thing.

1709
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,480
It was your decision to keep it going.

1710
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,660
- I wanted the conviction.

1711
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,760
- [Elizabeth] You wanted the excitement.

1712
01:13:42,015 --> 01:13:44,520
- Bullshit.

1713
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,380
- How many threatening letters

1714
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,600
from harmless malcontents

1715
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,620
would you have to track down

1716
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,820
before you were able to command

1717
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,170
another case like this one?

1718
01:13:54,171 --> 01:13:55,893
- We keep the President alive.

1719
01:13:57,873 --> 01:13:59,400
- You're bored to death.

1720
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,971
At least Duggo keeps
you shitting a little.

1721
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:06,600
- You're really a disgusting woman.

1722
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,620
- [Elizabeth] He slipped you before.

1723
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:09,060
He can do it again.

1724
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,463
- No, no, impossible.

1725
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:13,731
- Stop it.

1726
01:14:13,731 --> 01:14:15,675
Arrest them now.

1727
01:14:15,675 --> 01:14:17,730
- No.

1728
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,180
- You can come in now, Duggo.

1729
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,935
(footsteps approaching)

1730
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:26,873
(tense music continues)

1731
01:14:26,873 --> 01:14:28,650
I think you should tell Duggo

1732
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:31,473
why you sent a helicopter in
after him in the mountains.

1733
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,977
- No, no, no.

1734
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:36,243
I didn't do it.

1735
01:14:36,243 --> 01:14:37,873
- Didn't you?

1736
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,206
He didn't do it.

1737
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,550
You sent a helicopter in

1738
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,800
because you wanted him to shoot at it

1739
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,900
so you could then send men in to kill him.

1740
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,550
And when that didn't work,

1741
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,170
you decided to use me.

1742
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:55,500
You see, you're not Arthur's
creation after all, Duggo.

1743
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,333
You're his.

1744
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,647
(Granger moaning on tape)

1745
01:14:58,647 --> 01:14:59,480
- No!

1746
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,813
(gun bangs)

1747
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,513
- Honey, are you all right?

1748
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:11,963
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:15:11,963 --> 01:15:12,796
Go back to sleep.

1750
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:27,540
- Like anybody, I would
like to live a long life.

1751
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,543
Longevity has its place.

1752
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:34,170
- This was the night before he was shot.

1753
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:36,120
He knew what was gonna happen,

1754
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,683
but he couldn't change destiny.

1755
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,310
- And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain

1756
01:15:43,449 --> 01:15:45,960
and I've looked over

1757
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,901
and I've seen the Promise Land.

1758
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:51,300
(audience cheering)

1759
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,133
I may not get there with you,

1760
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,033
but I want you to know tonight

1761
01:15:56,907 --> 01:16:00,067
that we as a people will
get to the Promise Land.

1762
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:04,236
(audience applauding)

1763
01:16:06,808 --> 01:16:08,071
So I'm happy tonight.

1764
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:10,290
I'm not worried about anything.

1765
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,724
I'm not fearing any man.

1766
01:16:12,724 --> 01:16:15,445
My eyes have seen the glory

1767
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:17,612
of the coming of the Lord.

1768
01:16:18,826 --> 01:16:20,700
- [Duggo] My dearest Lorina,

1769
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:21,750
your father promised me

1770
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,670
that this letter will get to you

1771
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,740
and I hope by the time it does,

1772
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,990
you'll know that I'm a
true American patriot.

1773
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:31,620
I never wanted to be called hero.

1774
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,670
And that's not how I think of myself now.

1775
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,950
But tomorrow I must do
something very difficult.

1776
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,813
And that may mean giving my own life.

1777
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,210
I know this is something

1778
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,340
you've been used to over the years,

1779
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,140
but this time is a little different.

1780
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,870
I can't tell you more,

1781
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,270
but let's just say that
fate has me cast in a role

1782
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,720
I never thought I would play.

1783
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,330
Arthur Gwenlyn happens to
be right about one thing.

1784
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:59,463
There are a lot of angry people out there.

1785
01:17:00,952 --> 01:17:02,313
If something happens to me,

1786
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,360
please tell my daughter the
good things you remember.

1787
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,629
As ever, your loving husband.

1788
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:11,046
(soft music)

1789
01:17:24,613 --> 01:17:27,536
(helicopter whirring)

1790
01:17:27,536 --> 01:17:30,286
(dramatic music)

1791
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:07,205
(soft tense music)

1792
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:34,721
(soft tense music continues)

1793
01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:51,717
(bell ringing)

1794
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:54,863
- Rancher three.

1795
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,493
Rancher three on camera one and two.

1796
01:19:00,139 --> 01:19:05,139
(Lahoud and Haddad
speaking foreign language)

1797
01:19:21,293 --> 01:19:24,126
(Eric whistling)

1798
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:31,965
- Well, I guess this is it, huh?

1799
01:19:31,965 --> 01:19:32,848
- [Elizabeth] I guess so.

1800
01:19:32,848 --> 01:19:35,130
- You know, this is gonna
be one really exciting day.

1801
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,450
I can just feel it.

1802
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,530
And I promise you guys

1803
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:40,050
are really gonna be
impressed by what I do.

1804
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,423
- I'm sure we will, Eric.

1805
01:19:42,467 --> 01:19:45,360
- Elizabeth, are you ready?

1806
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,027
- I'm ready, Arthur.

1807
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:50,567
(tense music)

1808
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,453
- Rancher One.

1809
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:13,320
This is Rancher Four, over.

1810
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,880
- Go ahead, Rancher Four.

1811
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,780
- [Rancher Four] Redneck is leaving now.

1812
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,230
Be advised we're rolling out.

1813
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,330
- Copy Rancher Four.

1814
01:20:21,044 --> 01:20:23,481
(tires squeal)

1815
01:20:23,481 --> 01:20:26,398
(soft tense music)

1816
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:32,940
- I have a room reserved.

1817
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,080
Richard Wells.

1818
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,180
- Oh, Mr. Wells, we've been expecting you.

1819
01:20:38,269 --> 01:20:39,207
You need help with that?

1820
01:20:39,207 --> 01:20:40,040
- No, thanks.

1821
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,040
I'll manage.

1822
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:51,467
(soft tense music continues)

1823
01:21:14,573 --> 01:21:18,323
(soft tense music continues)

1824
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:32,498
(dramatic music)

1825
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:39,083
(helicopter whirring)

1826
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,810
- Did you check the exposure?

1827
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:49,643
- Yes.

1828
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,650
- Both cameras?

1829
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,550
- Yes. Now shut up.

1830
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,323
You're making me forget things.

1831
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,423
- Shit.

1832
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,250
Look, I gotta run to the car.

1833
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,780
I forgot something for the video.

1834
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,043
- You better hurry back.

1835
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:09,552
(soft tense music)

1836
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:21,120
- Sorry, fellas. No parking up here.

1837
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,470
- How about those guys over there?

1838
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,858
- They work here.

1839
01:22:23,858 --> 01:22:25,385
- You know we're shooting a movie.

1840
01:22:25,385 --> 01:22:26,802
- A movie?
- Yeah.

1841
01:22:28,898 --> 01:22:30,398
Here's the permit.

1842
01:22:31,548 --> 01:22:35,298
(soft tense music continues)

1843
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:39,727
- Oh, no.

1844
01:22:39,727 --> 01:22:40,560
Shit.

1845
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,470
- Rancher Four.

1846
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,360
Pick up the Leatherneck right now.

1847
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,590
Arrest him.

1848
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:56,423
- [Rancher Four] Confirm, sir.

1849
01:22:56,423 --> 01:22:57,840
You did say arrest now?

1850
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,193
- Affirmative. Nail him.

1851
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,400
- [Rancher Four] Yes,
sir. Rancher Four out.

1852
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,655
- He's got to have the rifle with him.

1853
01:23:04,655 --> 01:23:06,120
All we need is one live round

1854
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,010
and we can make it stick.

1855
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,560
- What the fuck made you change your mind?

1856
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,863
- It's just something in
the pit of my stomach.

1857
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:19,163
- By the way,

1858
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:21,046
you can check the cameras in the back.

1859
01:23:21,046 --> 01:23:23,546
(tense music)

1860
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:32,340
- Well, you can't do it up there.

1861
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,290
Down two levels is okay.

1862
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,752
- Please only will take us a few minutes.

1863
01:23:35,752 --> 01:23:36,710
- You just can't do it, buddy.

1864
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,385
You have to go.

1865
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:40,162
- [Haddad] How about if you
go away for a little while?

1866
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:41,550
I'll give you $50 for lunch.

1867
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,170
Nobody will know. Please.

1868
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,940
You can eat nice.

1869
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:45,773
Please.

1870
01:23:45,773 --> 01:23:47,694
- I said let's go. Move it.

1871
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:48,557
- I don't think so.

1872
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,676
(gun bangs)

1873
01:23:50,676 --> 01:23:54,207
(dramatic music)

1874
01:23:54,207 --> 01:23:58,457
(Lahoud speaking foreign language)

1875
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,730
(sirens wailing)

1876
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:25,001
- Secret Service!

1877
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:25,835
Turn your engine off

1878
01:24:25,835 --> 01:24:27,594
and put your hands where I can see them!

1879
01:24:27,594 --> 01:24:28,927
- Stop, partner.

1880
01:24:32,558 --> 01:24:34,536
Where the fuck's the
owner of this vehicle?

1881
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,063
- I'm the owner.

1882
01:24:36,063 --> 01:24:38,151
I won it at a poker game last night.

1883
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:39,980
And this hat too!

1884
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:42,860
What kind of shit is this?

1885
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:45,360
(tense music)

1886
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:19,183
(tense music continues)

1887
01:25:33,924 --> 01:25:37,257
(tense music continues)

1888
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:50,520
- What do you mean you lost him?

1889
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,360
Damn it!

1890
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,193
- He's not coming here.

1891
01:25:52,193 --> 01:25:53,850
Let's abort the visit.

1892
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,560
- We can't.

1893
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,697
I woke up at three o'clock this morning

1894
01:25:56,697 --> 01:25:58,680
and I called the President.

1895
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,763
He refused.

1896
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,430
All right, we got one chance.

1897
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:03,805
Move out.

1898
01:26:03,805 --> 01:26:08,805
(tense music)
(sirens wailing)

1899
01:26:24,065 --> 01:26:27,398
(tense music continues)

1900
01:26:53,828 --> 01:26:57,161
(tense music continues)

1901
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,163
(Arthur sighs)

1902
01:27:21,414 --> 01:27:22,747
- Elizabeth, no!

1903
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:24,543
Elizabeth!

1904
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:28,887
(tense music continues)

1905
01:27:35,212 --> 01:27:38,295
(film reel whirring)

1906
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:53,133
(horns honking)

1907
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:07,887
(gun clicks)

1908
01:28:08,727 --> 01:28:11,477
(scope whirring)

1909
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:15,600
- Come on, the top of you.

1910
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,850
Just stick your head out.

1911
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,310
- Forgot the damn lens.

1912
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:38,797
(sirens wailing)

1913
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,300
- All units move in and apprehend.

1914
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,360
Repeat all units, let's move in now.

1915
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,473
Let's get 'em now.

1916
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:55,620
- Secret Service. You're under arrest.

1917
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,754
- What are you doing?

1918
01:28:57,754 --> 01:28:58,776
What the fuck are you...

1919
01:28:58,776 --> 01:29:01,276
Get your fucking hands off me!

1920
01:29:06,077 --> 01:29:07,303
- Oh shit.

1921
01:29:07,303 --> 01:29:10,636
(tense music continues)

1922
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:16,646
- I'll go high. You go low.

1923
01:29:16,646 --> 01:29:17,479
You ready?

1924
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:20,210
Secret Service. Don't move.

1925
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:21,237
- Don't shoot, man. Don't shoot!

1926
01:29:21,237 --> 01:29:22,070
I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed!

1927
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:22,999
It's only a movie.

1928
01:29:22,999 --> 01:29:24,593
It's only a movie, I swear!

1929
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:25,877
It's only a movie.

1930
01:29:25,877 --> 01:29:27,510
- You're not supposed to be there.

1931
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:29,850
You're supposed to be over there.

1932
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:32,142
And this isn't in the show anymore.

1933
01:29:32,142 --> 01:29:36,392
(Lahoud speaking foreign language)

1934
01:29:41,357 --> 01:29:42,684
- Oh my God.

1935
01:29:42,684 --> 01:29:46,017
(tense music continues)

1936
01:29:47,559 --> 01:29:50,309
(sirens wailing)

1937
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,660
- This is the only one tall enough

1938
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,310
to see over the safety perimeter.

1939
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:05,543
(tense music continues)

1940
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,052
Secret Service.

1941
01:30:18,052 --> 01:30:19,010
Off the elevator.

1942
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:20,670
Come on!

1943
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:23,420
(dramatic music)

1944
01:30:37,924 --> 01:30:39,364
- Haddad.

1945
01:30:39,364 --> 01:30:41,100
She's not your enemy.

1946
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,058
Let her go.

1947
01:30:42,058 --> 01:30:44,562
- Haddad, there are Secret Service.

1948
01:30:44,562 --> 01:30:48,812
(Lahoud speaking foreign language)

1949
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,559

(helicopter whirring)

1955
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,090
- Bring them out, Arthur.

1956
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:49,492
Come on.

1957
01:31:49,492 --> 01:31:52,159
(scope beeping)

1958
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:57,484

(car alarm blaring)

1965
01:33:11,013 --> 01:33:11,846
- Haddad!

(gun bangs)

1967
01:33:19,178 --> 01:33:21,511

01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:56,644
(helicopters whirring)

1973
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,320
- I didn't let anybody else in.

1974
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,783
There's something I think
you should see first.

1975
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,540
This is a torpedo spool.

1976
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:15,180
It unravels at a high rate of speed.

1977
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:18,000
It would've made that model
helicopter wire guided,

1978
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,610
which means that Black
Hawk flying up there

1979
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:22,920
couldn't have jammed it signal.

1980
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,983
Now Duggo saw this spool
somewhere and he knew.

1981
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,580
He planned to save the President

1982
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,220
and Gwenlyn was going to film it.

1983
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,263
We got the wrong man.

1984
01:34:37,258 --> 01:34:39,675
(soft music)

1985
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:45,093
- Special Agent Lang.

1986
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:49,320
Get me a full profile on Duggo.

1987
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,660
Psychiatric, full medical.

1988
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,430
- Full with pictures for the press?

1989
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:54,753
- Yeah, and in uniform.

1990
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,083
We never saw this.

1991
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:03,183
- Yes, sir, Chief Granger.

1992
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:06,864
(dramatic music)

1993
01:35:10,351 --> 01:35:13,140
- And cut.

1994
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:13,973
That's a wrap.

1995
01:35:13,973 --> 01:35:18,951
(all cheering)
(jaunty music)

1996
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,443
- Hey, Lucas.

1997
01:35:27,443 --> 01:35:29,880
You know, it was really
great playing you, man.

1998
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,713
I mean, you know,

1999
01:35:30,713 --> 01:35:32,460
you're really gave me a lot
of good technical advice.

2000
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:33,610
I really appreciate it.

2001
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,110
- Yeah, but it was only a movie.

2002
01:35:39,355 --> 01:35:41,938
(gentle music)

2003
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,460
- [Mary] "Crossfire" was
a real departure for you.

2004
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,530
- Well, it's actually "Cross Point" Mary,

2005
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,663
but yes, it was a frightening departure.

2006
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,177
Actually, my wife came
up to me and she said,

2007
01:35:55,177 --> 01:35:56,550
"Do you know that the children

2008
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,350
are calling you a real killer?"

2009
01:35:58,350 --> 01:36:00,995
Well, I said, "But it's only a movie."

2010
01:36:00,995 --> 01:36:03,745
(all chattering)

2011
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:10,939
- [Actor] Took my blade
and just stabbed him.

2012
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,270
- Excuse me?

2013
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,380
You're the director, aren't you?

2014
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,213
- Yes, I am.

2015
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:21,870
You're an actress, aren't you?

2016
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:22,703
- Yes.

2017
01:36:22,703 --> 01:36:24,570
Well, I wanna be,

2018
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,070
and I'm taking classes right now,

2019
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:28,800
but haven't really done anything yet

2020
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,394
except some plays in high school.

2021
01:36:30,394 --> 01:36:32,320
- Hey, don't put yourself down.

2022
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,690
That's acting.

2023
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:35,430
You're an actress.

2024
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:36,373
Come on, say it.

2025
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:38,973
I'm an actress.

2026
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:41,010
- Morton Lewis?

2027
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:41,843
- Yeah.

2028
01:36:41,843 --> 01:36:43,953
- United States Treasury Secret Service.

2029
01:36:44,970 --> 01:36:46,670
- Oh my God, I don't believe this.

2030
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:48,750
Hey, look, come on guys.

2031
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,040
I mean, this is just a movie, you know-

2032
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,560
- We're not here for this piece of crap.

2033
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,830
Did you hire a Brad Lucas under this film?

2034
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:56,790
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

2035
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,530
He was my technical advisor.

2036
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:00,129
I mean, the real one, you know.

2037
01:37:00,129 --> 01:37:01,946
- [Agent] Have you seen him lately?

2038
01:37:01,946 --> 01:37:03,030
- [Morton] No, no I haven't.

2039
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:05,220
It's funny, I gave him a
part as a cop in the film

2040
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,570
and I thought maybe
he'd show up to see it,

2041
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,256
but he hasn't.

2042
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:09,390
I don't know why.

2043
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:11,673
It was really his life story.

2044
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,580
But he was a little too scary.

2045
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,647
He kept wanting to make it more real.

2046
01:37:17,647 --> 01:37:21,033
I had to tell him, "Look,
it's just a movie."

2047
01:37:21,033 --> 01:37:22,300
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

2048
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:25,699
the President of the
United States of America.

2049
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:28,616
("Hail the Chief")

2050
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:33,143
(scope whirring)

2051
01:37:39,942 --> 01:37:41,814
(scope beeping)

2052
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:44,564
(dramatic music)

2053
01:38:07,996 --> 01:38:10,579
(jaunty music)

2054
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:41,277
(jaunty music continues)

2055
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:01,351
(dramatic music)

2056
01:39:15,795 --> 01:39:18,212
(soft music)
