1
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,441
It's small!

2
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,332
No, please. No!
Please!

3
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,917
Davey!

4
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,419
Come running, lad!

5
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:09,383
- Stop!
- Brand you like a damn steer, bitch!

6
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,720
- No. Please!
- Hold the bitch! Go on, hold her!

7
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,307
Hold her, damn it!
I'll cut her tits off!

8
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:19,643
Go get Skinny! Quick!

9
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,354
Mike, don't!

10
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:28,944
Skinny!

11
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:31,405
Think it's funny?

12
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,158
Skinny, get the gun!

13
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:47,963
Get off of her, cowboy.

14
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,264
- Wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.

15
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,892
He says he'll shoot them.
I says, "You can't. "

16
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:04,563
He says, "Get Little Bill. "
I says, "He's sleeping. "

17
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:08,483
He says he don't care.
He'll shoot them boys soon.

18
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,457
She gonna die?

19
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,500
She's gonna live.

20
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,505
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

21
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:33,425
When she seen
his teensy little pecker...

22
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:37,804
... she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

23
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:42,309
You can hang them, Little Bill.

24
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:06,666
Step over to the office
and get the bullwhip.

25
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:10,337
A whipping's all they get
after what they done?

26
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:16,385
- It ain't no little thing, Alice.
- But what they done--

27
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,136
Shut up!

28
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:23,725
- Whipping ain't gonna settle this.
- No?

29
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:29,022
Here's a contract between me
and Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

30
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,693
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

31
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:37,614
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

32
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,157
Property.

33
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:41,201
Damaged property.

34
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:45,038
Like if I hamstrung
one of their ponies.

35
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,751
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

36
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,045
Hell, no!

37
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,089
Won't pay to do it.

38
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:59,803
She can clean, but nobody's gonna pay
good money for a cut-up whore!

39
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:06,518
You boys are off the Bar T.
Got your own string of ponies?

40
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:09,271
Yeah, I got four.

41
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,483
Six.

42
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,737
You just as soon
not have a trial, no fuss?

43
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,739
No, sir.

44
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,783
All right.

45
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,077
You did the cutting.

46
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:27,914
Come the fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny here.

47
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,833
Five?

48
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,919
And you!
You bring in two.

49
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,255
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

50
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,800
Here's the bullwhip, Bill.

51
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:42,304
Maybe we don't need this now.

52
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:48,435
Let me tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies... .

53
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:53,982
- I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

54
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,068
I fined them instead, Alice.

55
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:00,030
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

56
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,283
That ain't fair.

57
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:04,868
That ain't fair!

58
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:14,586
Haven't you seen
enough blood tonight?

59
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,008
Hell, Alice!

60
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:26,556
It ain't like they was tramps or
loafers or bad men. They were just...

61
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,976
... hardworking boys that was foolish.

62
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:34,147
- If they was given over to wickedness--
- Like whores?

63
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,859
Tend to Delilah.

64
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,113
Go ahead.

65
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:05,929
I got $85.

66
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,639
I don't know.

67
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,393
If Delilah doesn't care,
why are we so riled up?

68
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:15,313
Just because we let them fools
ride us like horses...

69
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:19,025
... don't mean we let them
brand us like horses.

70
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:24,281
Maybe we ain't nothing but whores,
but, by God, we ain't horses!

71
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:28,243
I got $112.

72
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:30,662
That's everything.

73
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:33,623
How about you, Faith?

74
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,877
Two hundred.

75
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:41,172
Two hundred and forty dollars.

76
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,718
Jesus, Faith!
What you been doing?

77
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:48,638
Been giving Skinny something special?

78
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,185
She laughed.

79
00:07:57,481 --> 00:08:01,276
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue--

80
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:02,736
It ain't enough.

81
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:06,448
Not yet, maybe.

82
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:49,616
You don't look like no
rootin'-tootin'...

83
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:53,036
... son of a bitching
cold-blooded assassin.

84
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,375
Say what?

85
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:03,254
My guess is you're calling yourself
Mr. William Munny.

86
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,758
You have me confused
with someone else, mister.

87
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:10,929
The same one who shot Charlie Pepper
in Lake County?

88
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:12,681
Pa! Hey, Pa!

89
00:09:12,848 --> 00:09:14,349
What's up, son?

90
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:16,559
Two more hogs got the fever.

91
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,645
You shot Charlie Pepper.

92
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:22,232
You killed William Harvey
and robbed that train in Missouri.

93
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,733
Hold on, mister.

94
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,654
Son, get those hogs separated there.

95
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,781
Penny, help your brother.

96
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:33,535
- That one's sick too?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,665
We'll talk inside.

98
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,050
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

99
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:55,682
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

100
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,352
I could have. Easy.

101
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,857
I guess maybe so.

102
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:10,321
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

103
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:12,866
Maybe I ain't.

104
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:17,495
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son of a bitch alive.

105
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:22,542
And if I wanted a partner
for a killing, you were the worst one.

106
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,881
Meaning the best.

107
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,842
On account as you're as cold as snow...

108
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,970
... and don't have
no weak nerve nor fear.

109
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:38,266
Pete said that?

110
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,603
Yeah, he did.

111
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,147
I'm a killer myself, except...

112
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,609
... I ain't killed as many as you
because of my youth.

113
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,488
Schofield Kid,
that's what they call me.

114
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:54,908
Why?

115
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,410
You from Schofield?

116
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,412
No, it's on account...

117
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:03,124
... of my Schofield model
Smith & Wesson pistol.

118
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,464
How about it, Will?

119
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:12,050
How about what?

120
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,761
How about being my partner?

121
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,809
I'm heading north through Niobrara
to Wyoming to kill two no-good cowboys.

122
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,770
For what?

123
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:28,024
For cutting up a lady.
Cut up her face.

124
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:31,069
Cut her eyes out,
cut her ears off.

125
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:34,322
They even cut her teats.

126
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:38,785
Jesus.

127
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,955
$1000 reward, Will.

128
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:44,707
500 apiece.

129
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,089
I can't move those damn pigs!

130
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:55,718
Watch your cussing, will you?
Do the best you can with it.

131
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,639
Then go to the pump
and get cleaned up. Come on.

132
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,939
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

133
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,861
It was whiskey done it
as much as anything else.

134
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:15,321
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

135
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:19,492
My wife, she cured me of that.

136
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:23,955
Cured me of drinking and wickedness.

137
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,834
You don't look so prosperous.

138
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:33,006
You could buy her a new dress
with your half.

139
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:37,886
- If we kill them, you can buy your--
- She's passed on.

140
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:39,470
What?

141
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:44,350
Been gone near 3 years now.

142
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:55,445
Don't tell no one about the reward.
I don't need other gunmen collecting.

143
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:58,197
We don't see no one out here.

144
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:03,786
If you was to change your mind,
I'll be riding due west...

145
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:06,289
... for the trail into Wyoming.

146
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:15,006
Come on, let's separate those hogs.

147
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:48,289
Two others.
I think they got the fever.

148
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:48,391
Took you boys a while.

149
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:52,979
A few more days and I was
gonna call on the sheriff.

150
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,480
How about that?

151
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:57,859
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

152
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,903
I bet. Sleepy,
get them horses to the livery.

153
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:03,781
Neil, take that one
over around the back.

154
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,791
Now there's a beauty.

155
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:17,128
You got two of mine.
This here one ain't yours.

156
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,130
We'll see about that.

157
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,217
Bastards!
Get out of town!

158
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:28,598
Sick sons of bitches!

159
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,521
- Don't come back, butcher!
- This here pony...

160
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:39,108
... I brung for the lady my partner cut.

161
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,538
She's the best.

162
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:00,880
Better than the ones I gave him.

163
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:06,052
She can sell her...

164
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,346
... or do what she wants.

165
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,813
A pony? She ain't got no face left,
you give her a mangy pony?

166
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:19,148
She ain't mangy!

167
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,818
Get out of here!

168
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:25,404
We don't need your goddamn charity!

169
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,574
Get out of our town
and don't come back!

170
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,578
Get out of our town!

171
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,279
Did Pa used to kill folks?

172
00:18:56,807 --> 00:19:00,184
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

173
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:05,273
He ain't a saddle horse no more.
Ain't used to the feel.

174
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,400
Take care of your sister, son.

175
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:12,405
Kill a few chickens if you must.
Keep those hogs with the fever separate.

176
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:17,368
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

177
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,813
Ain't been in the saddle myself
in a while.

178
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:53,195
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

179
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:57,616
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

180
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:02,330
... I used to be weak
and given to mistreating animals.

181
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:11,255
This horse and those hogs
over there...

182
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:17,261
... are getting even
for the cruelty I inflicted.

183
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:19,263
I used to be able to cuss...

184
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:24,018
... and whip a horse, but your ma
showed me the error of my ways.

185
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:28,147
I'll be back in two weeks.

186
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:33,444
Remember the spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

187
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,339
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!

188
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,926
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!

189
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,053
Lying?

190
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:02,890
What'll you do if somebody
comes to collect?

191
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,769
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

192
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:14,777
The kind of people who come for it
won't tolerate you not having it!

193
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:20,491
They won't just cut up your face!

194
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,038
You stupid bitches.

195
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,707
You stupid bitches!

196
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:42,263
Shit!

197
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,974
Damn it! Jesus!

198
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,185
Hit your finger?

199
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,231
Hello, Skinny.

200
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,692
Damn, you snuck up on me.

201
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,528
What do you think of her?

202
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,322
I heard you done the roof yourself.

203
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:05,161
Roof? Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

204
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:09,290
The Roberts boy carried wood for me,
but that's all.

205
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,417
What is all that wood?

206
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,463
I'm building a porch
so I can sit of an evening...

207
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:20,259
... and smoke my pipe and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

208
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,848
Came out here just
to take a look at her?

209
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:28,100
- Them whores!
- Yeah?

210
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:33,814
Been humping them cowboys
who been in town the last two weeks.

211
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:35,733
Shit, Skinny.

212
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:40,362
We got railroad barons.
We got cattle barons.

213
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:43,449
You'll be the first billiard baron.

214
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:47,620
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

215
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:50,873
... they'll pay $1000 to whoever...

216
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:54,126
... kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

217
00:22:56,338 --> 00:23:00,591
Those cowboys are riding that beef
down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

218
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,017
All week long?

219
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,770
I didn't hear till last night myself.

220
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:17,066
The word's probably got all the way
to Texas by now.

221
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:21,612
Nobody'll come clear from Texas.

222
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,573
You sure they got that money?

223
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:30,329
Women can lie. Asked where the
money is, they say they got none.

224
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,875
But those five could have
squirreled it away. Maybe.

225
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:39,547
That much?

226
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:43,801
You could run off them two cowboys.

227
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:46,971
I could run off them whores.

228
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,809
They'll just up and run anyhow,
them two.

229
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,065
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

230
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:00,943
Close to their friends.

231
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,155
Shit, could be nobody
won't come at all.

232
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,910
Got to go.
I like your house.

233
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:46,530
Well, I'll be... .

234
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:49,366
It's Will!

235
00:24:55,999 --> 00:25:01,629
Come in the house out of the sun.
Sally, see to Will's horse.

236
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,969
What are you doing here?

237
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:12,389
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

238
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:15,643
We ain't bad men no more.

239
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:17,645
We're farmers.

240
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:22,858
Should be easy killing them,
if they don't go on down to Texas.

241
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,572
How long since you fired a gun
at a man? Nine, ten years?

242
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:32,326
Eleven.

243
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:35,079
Easy, huh?

244
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:39,166
I don't know it was
all that easy even back then.

245
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:42,294
And we was young and full of beans.

246
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:44,588
If you was mad at them...

247
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,966
... over some wrong,
I could see shooting them.

248
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:51,345
We done stuff for money before.

249
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,017
We thought we did.

250
00:25:57,268 --> 00:26:00,312
What'd these fellows do?
Cheat at cards?

251
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:04,108
Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

252
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:05,901
They cut up a woman.

253
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:07,569
What?

254
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:14,159
Cut up her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

255
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,205
Everything but her cunny,
I suppose.

256
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,625
I'll be dogged.

257
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,965
Guess they got it coming.

258
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,051
Of course, Will...

259
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:36,348
... if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

260
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,527
Could you look in on my youngsters
next week?

261
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:51,655
They got some hogs
they're trying to separate.

262
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,744
How long you reckon you're gonna be?

263
00:26:58,246 --> 00:26:59,747
Two weeks, I guess.

264
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,343
What's this Kid like?

265
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:17,806
Three ways?

266
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:22,603
I see you still have
that Spencer rifle.

267
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:28,942
And I can still knock the eye
out of a bird flying too.

268
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,911
Jesus, Will!

269
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:38,428
He must be moving right along.

270
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:42,432
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

271
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:54,945
Kind of got used to my bed.

272
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:58,615
This ain't going to be like no home.

273
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:01,535
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

274
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,417
Hell, I'm sorry.

275
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:12,546
Don't fret it.
It ain't nothing.

276
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:18,677
She don't like it much,
you riding off with me.

277
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,513
Gave me the evil eye.

278
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:27,728
You know, Sally's injun...

279
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:30,772
... and injuns ain't over-friendly.

280
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:34,401
I don't blame her.

281
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,738
I won't hold it against her.

282
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,907
She knew me back then.

283
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:41,909
She knew what a...

284
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:44,912
... no-good son of a bitch I was.

285
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:49,333
She ain't allowing that I changed.

286
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,920
She don't realize I ain't
like that no more.

287
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,505
- You know, Will--
- I ain't the same.

288
00:29:57,008 --> 00:30:01,762
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

289
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,890
Going on this killing...

290
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,226
... don't mean I'll go back
to the way I was.

291
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:11,271
Just need the money.

292
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:15,192
Get a new start for them youngsters.

293
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:22,699
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

294
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:26,036
... and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

295
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:31,541
I think about him now and again.

296
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:37,130
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

297
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:41,176
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

298
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,975
You was one crazy son of a bitch.

299
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,189
No one liked me,
and the boys all thought...

300
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,193
... I'd shoot them
out of pure meanness.

301
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,405
You ain't like that no more.

302
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:04,491
Eagle, he hated my guts.

303
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,870
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

304
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,081
Quincy neither, I reckon.

305
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:16,503
Quincy used to just watch
all the time...

306
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:19,423
... scared.

307
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:22,092
Like I said...

308
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:26,346
... you ain't like that no more.

309
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:27,848
That's right.

310
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,351
I'm just a fellow now.

311
00:31:31,602 --> 00:31:34,438
I ain't no different
than anyone else...

312
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:36,440
... no more.

313
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,835
What son of a bitch shot him?
Was it one of them John Bulls?

314
00:31:57,086 --> 00:32:01,590
No, sir. The would-be assassin
is a gentleman of French ancestry.

315
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:05,635
Or so it seems.
I don't wish to give offense...

316
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:09,806
... but the French are known
to be a race of assassins...

317
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:12,059
... who can't shoot worth a damn.

318
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,979
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

319
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,984
Says here a fellow by the name
of Guiteau. G-U-L-T--

320
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:24,905
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

321
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:30,952
Again, I don't wish to give offense
when I suggest this country select...

322
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:35,499
... a king or even a queen,
rather than a president.

323
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,462
One isn't that quick
to shoot a king or a queen.

324
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,173
The majesty of royalty, you see.

325
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,179
Maybe you don't wish
to give offense, sir...

326
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,598
... but you are giving it pretty thick.

327
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,768
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

328
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:57,771
- When I heard about queens--
- Shut up, Joe.

329
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,774
What's wrong with you, Thirsty?
This dude--

330
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:03,902
Might be that this dude
is English Bob.

331
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:07,948
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

332
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:12,035
Might be he's waiting for some cowboy
to touch his pistol...

333
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:13,912
... so he can shoot him.

334
00:33:25,716 --> 00:33:28,301
Is that a fact, mister?

335
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,220
You English Bob?

336
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,516
Pheasants.

337
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,311
Let's shoot some pheasants.

338
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,813
Ten shots.

339
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,816
At, let's say, $1 a pheasant.

340
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:46,653
I'll shoot for the queen, and you...

341
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:48,655
... for whomever.

342
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:10,427
That's eight for me and one for you.
That comes to seven American dollars.

343
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:13,013
Pretty damn good shooting...

344
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,931
... for a John Bull.

345
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:19,769
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

346
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:24,107
... over the injury to your president.

347
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:39,497
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

348
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:40,749
Does what?

349
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,211
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

350
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:52,469
That's the second one shot
in 20 years.

351
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:56,056
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

352
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:54,447
Thank you.

353
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:58,618
Pardon me, gentlemen.

354
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:06,376
The law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities.

355
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:08,670
Proper authority?

356
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:17,220
I assure you that neither my companion
or I carry firearms on our person.

357
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:21,599
We rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man...

358
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:24,227
... and the forbearance of reptiles.

359
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,492
Unarmed, my ass!

360
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:41,953
Christ, it's hot!

361
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:46,791
If I'm going to get shot,
I'd rather it was hot than cold.

362
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:51,171
Everything hurts more when it's cold.
You know how if you hit--

363
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:52,630
Shut up, Fatty!

364
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,259
Clyde's back.

365
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,386
- With Little Bill?
- No.

366
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:00,221
Shit!

367
00:37:05,644 --> 00:37:08,438
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

368
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,483
Where's Little Bill?

369
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:13,610
Building his damn porch.

370
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:15,695
Building his porch?

371
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:19,616
If you got shot,
would you want it to be hot or cold?

372
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:21,618
I ain't gonna get shot.

373
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,704
He's coming?

374
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:27,499
Of course he's coming.

375
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,709
I just loaded that.

376
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,172
I don't trust nobody loading my guns
before a shooting.

377
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:35,548
What'd he say?

378
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:39,010
Little Bill said he was building
his porch.

379
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,597
- You seen that thing?
- It was all loaded.

380
00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:46,267
Clyde, you got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

381
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:50,897
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

382
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,777
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

383
00:37:56,237 --> 00:38:00,740
Or the whole house, for that matter!
He is the worst damn carpenter.

384
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,076
He didn't say nothing?

385
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:06,788
Asked what they looked like.

386
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:10,250
Maybe he's tough,
but he ain't no carpenter.

387
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,544
Maybe he ain't so tough.

388
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:16,464
Seem like he was scared?

389
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,384
Little Bill? Him scared?

390
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:23,888
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

391
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:26,182
Killers.

392
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:30,186
Little Bill come out of Kansas
and Texas, boys.

393
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:32,397
He worked them tough towns.

394
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:34,065
Just wondered.

395
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:37,944
Anybody could be scared.

396
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,951
He wasn't scared, boys.

397
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:49,164
He just ain't no carpenter.

398
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:56,212
There's a dignity in royalty...

399
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:59,591
... which precludes
the likelihood of assassination.

400
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:01,384
If you pointed a pistol...

401
00:39:01,635 --> 00:39:04,929
... at a monarch,
your hands would shake as if palsied.

402
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,725
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

403
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,810
That's a wise policy.

404
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:15,231
But if you did, I assure you,
the sight of royalty...

405
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:20,195
... would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed. You would stand--

406
00:39:20,446 --> 00:39:23,781
How shall I put it?
In awe.

407
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:31,498
A president... . 
Why not shoot a president?

408
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:38,671
Keep the change.

409
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:42,675
This Strawberry Alice person,
tell me again.

410
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:46,679
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

411
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,474
Say you want a game of billiards.

412
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:53,019
Billiards? Even though
I don't really wish to play?

413
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:57,106
No matter. They burned the table
in '78 for firewood.

414
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,359
Quite right.

415
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:03,321
Mr. Beauchamp,
I think a cup of tea--

416
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,671
Hello, Bob.

417
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:24,842
Boys, this here is English Bob.

418
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:28,263
Shit and fried eggs.

419
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:32,350
Been a long time.

420
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:35,103
Run out of Chinamen?

421
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:39,732
I thought that you were dead.

422
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,319
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

423
00:40:44,238 --> 00:40:47,907
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

424
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:51,578
Actually, what I heard was,
you fell off your horse...

425
00:40:51,745 --> 00:40:53,246
... drunk, of course.

426
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:56,124
And that you broke your bloody neck.

427
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,794
I heard that one myself, Bob.

428
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:01,879
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

429
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:05,425
Till I found out
I was just in Nebraska.

430
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:07,468
Who's he?

431
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,470
W. W. Beauchamp.

432
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:14,058
This is Little Bill Daggett.

433
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,269
And friends, of course.

434
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:19,814
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

435
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:22,317
In person.

436
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,987
You work for the railroads too?

437
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,157
I write.

438
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:31,284
Letters?

439
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:33,494
Books, Bill. Books.

440
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,663
Actually...

441
00:41:36,248 --> 00:41:38,708
... he's my biographer.

442
00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:46,841
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

443
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,184
It's only a book.

444
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:57,810
A book?

445
00:42:04,193 --> 00:42:06,653
That means you boys can read.

446
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,659
That means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms.

447
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:18,081
But like you told young Andy...

448
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,626
... you're not armed, are you?

449
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:23,378
Not really, Bill.

450
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:28,383
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

451
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:32,887
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

452
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:35,181
I'm afraid so, Bob.

453
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:39,018
I don't like firearms around.

454
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:02,625
Be very careful with it, sonny.

455
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:11,509
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

456
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,516
Make sure you don't get wet.

457
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:25,857
No shit.

458
00:43:26,108 --> 00:43:29,527
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

459
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:33,865
The Duck of Death?

460
00:43:34,116 --> 00:43:35,408
Duke.

461
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:38,578
"The Duke. "

462
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,750
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

463
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:46,127
I'll have that. 32, Bob.

464
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:00,933
Now, Little Bill...

465
00:44:01,643 --> 00:44:04,937
... you will leave me at the mercy
of my enemies.

466
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:11,235
Enemies?

467
00:44:14,323 --> 00:44:17,992
You been talking about the queen again?

468
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,410
On Independence Day?

469
00:44:32,508 --> 00:44:35,551
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

470
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:37,428
But it ain't so!

471
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:39,722
What I'm doing is talking!

472
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,851
You hear?!
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

473
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:46,604
To all those villains in Missouri!

474
00:44:54,363 --> 00:44:55,613
And those villains...

475
00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:58,908
... down in Cheyenne!

476
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:08,709
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

477
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:17,051
Even if there was,
they wouldn't want to come for it...

478
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,302
... anyhow!

479
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:50,543
What are you all looking at?!
Go on!

480
00:45:57,926 --> 00:45:59,844
Mind your own business!

481
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:30,249
Ever go into town?

482
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:35,379
On occasion.
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

483
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:39,175
I mean, get yourself a woman.

484
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:44,931
No, I never go into town for that.

485
00:46:45,098 --> 00:46:46,891
A man like me?

486
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:51,520
Only woman I could get
is one I'd have to pay for.

487
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:54,440
That ain't right, buying flesh.

488
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:59,528
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that...

489
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,238
... me being a father.

490
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,121
You just use your hand?

491
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:16,462
I don't miss it all that much.

492
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:39,485
Goddamn!
Somebody's shooting at us!

493
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:42,279
Shit. Did it hit you?

494
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:48,077
I bumped my head
falling off my horse.

495
00:47:52,374 --> 00:47:54,291
Ain't shooting at us no more.

496
00:47:56,712 --> 00:47:58,462
Shooting way over yonder.

497
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:03,217
What the hell's he shooting at?

498
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:06,137
Beats the hell out of me.

499
00:48:08,306 --> 00:48:10,474
Reckon we in somebody's field?

500
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:13,519
I didn't see nothing planted.

501
00:48:13,687 --> 00:48:15,146
Shooting at us again.

502
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:22,111
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

503
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:24,989
Wait! You'll mark us!

504
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,490
Hey, Kid!

505
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:32,496
- That's the Kid shooting at us?
- Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

506
00:48:32,748 --> 00:48:35,082
What's he shooting at us for?

507
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,584
Is that you?

508
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:40,671
Yeah, it's me!

509
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:44,341
Don't go shooting at us no more!
You hear me?

510
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:48,095
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

511
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,765
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

512
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,601
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

513
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:57,188
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

514
00:48:57,564 --> 00:49:01,025
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

515
00:49:01,943 --> 00:49:03,194
No, I ain't!

516
00:49:15,957 --> 00:49:20,086
- Chased that horse a damn mile.
- What was you shooting at us for?

517
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:23,089
- I thought you was following me.
- We was.

518
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,843
- You said if I changed my mind--
- Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

519
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:30,387
This here's Ned Logan.

520
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,766
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

521
00:49:34,017 --> 00:49:39,271
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is, you come to kill me.

522
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:41,982
We never talked about no other fellow.

523
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:46,612
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

524
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:50,699
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

525
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:56,205
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

526
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:58,249
Better than you, anyhow.

527
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,042
You wasn't even close.

528
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:02,795
Get your damn hands off my rifle!

529
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,975
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

530
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:17,685
It ain't bent.

531
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,523
- You were shooting all over!
- You'll share your half with him?

532
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:24,900
I figured three ways.

533
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:27,444
You figured wrong.

534
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:31,615
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

535
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:35,744
You going back with him?

536
00:50:36,788 --> 00:50:38,664
He's my partner.

537
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:40,749
He don't go, I don't go.

538
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:47,715
What's it come to, three ways?

539
00:51:41,728 --> 00:51:42,937
Shit!

540
00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:46,649
What are you pissing on about?

541
00:51:48,735 --> 00:51:52,321
- What are you looking at, anyhow?
- Looking at?

542
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:53,948
Clouds, Kid.

543
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:58,202
Looking at them on account of we got
a storm riding up our ass.

544
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:02,873
Hell, I seen them.

545
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:16,804
You was smart to change your mind.

546
00:52:19,057 --> 00:52:22,476
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

547
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:25,479
See that hawk?

548
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,902
I could hit it with one shot.

549
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:39,576
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

550
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:43,914
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

551
00:52:44,082 --> 00:52:47,084
You can't see for shit, can you?

552
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:51,005
See your canteen?

553
00:52:57,554 --> 00:52:58,929
How far can you see?

554
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:02,808
- Far enough.
- We ain't shooting canteens! How far?

555
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,311
- 100 yards?
- More.

556
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:08,397
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

557
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:11,525
- He's blind!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

558
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:13,360
Hold it!

559
00:53:14,237 --> 00:53:16,739
How far can you see, Kid?
50 yards?

560
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,075
You bet your ass
I can see 50 yards, Will.

561
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:23,871
I can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch.

562
00:53:24,122 --> 00:53:25,414
Hold on.

563
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,374
Hear that, Ned?

564
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:30,085
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

565
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:33,255
Jesus!

566
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,970
50 yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

567
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:51,357
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

568
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:56,653
Did you kill all seven of them?
Or just wing some of them?

569
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:05,746
That you here, Bob, on the cover?

570
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,833
"The Duck of Death"?

571
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:14,129
It's the Duke.
"Duke of Death. "

572
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:22,179
You always were the hell in Jesus
with a pistol, but seven of them?

573
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:26,683
Protecting that woman.
How do you do that?

574
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:33,524
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

575
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:36,652
... liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

576
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,695
For reasons involving the marketplace--

577
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:43,951
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

578
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:48,205
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

579
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:52,334
... that the events described
are from eyewitness accounts.

580
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:54,211
Eyewitnesses?

581
00:54:55,213 --> 00:54:58,465
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

582
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:00,634
The Duke.

583
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:02,344
Duck, I says.

584
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:14,982
"'You have insulted the honor
of this beautiful woman, Corcoran... '

585
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:16,483
... said the Duck.

586
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,736
'You must apologize. '

587
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,573
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would have none of it.

588
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:26,243
He reached for his pistols
and would have killed him...

589
00:55:26,494 --> 00:55:31,665
... but the Duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six-guns. "

590
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:35,419
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

591
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,048
There is a certain poetry to
the language which I couldn't resist.

592
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,430
I was in the Blue Bottle Saloon
in Wichita...

593
00:55:46,764 --> 00:55:50,267
... the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

594
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:52,186
I didn't see you there.

595
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:54,521
Nor no woman.

596
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:56,899
Nor two-gun shooters.

597
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:59,902
- Nor none of this.
- You were there?

598
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:01,570
Yeah, I was there.

599
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:05,616
First off...

600
00:56:06,284 --> 00:56:10,037
... Corky never carried two guns,
though he should have.

601
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:12,289
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

602
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,085
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun,
but not because he had two pistols.

603
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:19,296
It was because his dick...

604
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:23,008
... was longer than the barrel
on his Walker Colt.

605
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:30,265
Only insulting he did was stick it
into a French lady Bob was sweet on.

606
00:56:30,642 --> 00:56:36,063
When Corky walked into the Blue Bottle
and before he knew what's what...

607
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:39,816
... Bob takes a shot at him!
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

608
00:56:40,068 --> 00:56:44,238
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky. He did the wrong thing.

609
00:56:45,073 --> 00:56:47,324
He hurried
and shot his damn toe off.

610
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:50,160
Meantime, Bob here...

611
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,747
... aims real good
and squeezes off another...

612
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:58,961
... but he misses, he's still so drunk!
Hits a $1000 mirror over the bar.

613
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:04,967
The Duck of Death is as good as dead
because Corky does it right.

614
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,344
He aims real careful.

615
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:09,596
- No hurry.
- And?

616
00:57:12,016 --> 00:57:17,479
That Walker Colt blew up in his hand,
a failing common to that model.

617
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:23,360
If Corky'd had two guns instead of
a big dick, he would've been there...

618
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:26,280
... to defend himself to the end.

619
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:27,990
Wait a minute.

620
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:32,869
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have... .

621
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:37,040
Bob wasn't going to wait
for Corky to grow a new hand.

622
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:41,044
No, he just walked over there
real slow...

623
00:57:41,504 --> 00:57:43,880
... because he was drunk...

624
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:47,175
... and shot him
through the liver.

625
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:10,741
Don't like rocks
on my dadgum back!

626
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:14,911
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

627
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:20,584
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dadgum bed!

628
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:24,046
You'll miss your dadgum roof next,
I suppose.

629
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:27,132
Shit!

630
00:58:42,106 --> 00:58:46,234
That business up in Jackson County,
that really happen?

631
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:50,155
- The way they say it happened?
- What business?

632
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:56,662
There's two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you.

633
00:58:56,913 --> 00:58:58,664
Got you dead to rights.

634
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:02,459
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

635
00:59:02,669 --> 00:59:05,879
Only took a scratch yourself.

636
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:13,720
Uncle Pete never seen
nothing like it...

637
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,556
... shooting your way out
of that scrape.

638
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:22,813
I don't recollect.

639
00:59:26,192 --> 00:59:27,984
You don't recollect?

640
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,779
That's right.

641
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:33,699
Ned...

642
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,995
... how many men you killed?

643
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:44,459
Ain't you gonna answer?

644
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:48,004
What the hell's that to you?

645
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:55,762
To know the kind of fellow I'm riding
with, in case we get into a scrape.

646
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:01,643
- How many men you killed, Kid?
- Five.

647
01:00:01,853 --> 01:00:03,687
How many?

648
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:07,482
Five!

649
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:09,860
I done killed five of them.

650
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:15,240
That's including a Mexican.
He come after me with a knife.

651
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:17,701
Why don't you shut up?
Get some rest.

652
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:22,706
You boys are as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

653
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:30,172
Actually, then, Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck--

654
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:32,215
Than English Bob?

655
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:35,051
Faster?
Faster was his mistake.

656
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:38,889
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't have
shot himself in the toe.

657
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:41,224
He would've killed old Bob.

658
01:00:44,562 --> 01:00:47,647
Being a good shot,
being quick with a pistol...

659
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:52,736
... don't do no harm, but it don't mean
much next to being cool-headed.

660
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:57,073
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

661
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:59,367
... like as not he'll kill you.

662
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:03,997
- But if the other fellow is quicker--
- Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

663
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:05,415
Look here.

664
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:13,423
That's as fast as I can draw, aim, hit
anything more than 10 feet away.

665
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,509
Unless it's a barn.

666
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:17,886
But if he doesn't miss?

667
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,931
He'll kill you.

668
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:29,022
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

669
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:31,441
Like me.

670
01:01:32,068 --> 01:01:35,695
It ain't so easy to shoot a man
if he's shooting back.

671
01:01:35,947 --> 01:01:37,906
That'll flat rattle some folks.

672
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:41,910
Let me show you something.

673
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:44,871
Look here.
Take that.

674
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,626
Go on, take it.

675
01:01:53,965 --> 01:01:55,549
There's the key.

676
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:58,635
Just shoot me...

677
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:03,473
... and you and Bob can ride on
out of here free as birds.

678
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:12,357
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.

679
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:14,442
First, you got to cock it.

680
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:22,909
Go on, cock it.

681
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:33,169
Now you got to point it.

682
01:02:36,382 --> 01:02:37,883
Go on. Point it.

683
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:50,979
Now all you got to do
is pull the trigger.

684
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:06,786
Hot, ain't it?

685
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:11,708
Didn't even put your finger
on the trigger.

686
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:13,543
What if... ?

687
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:17,422
What if I gave it to him?

688
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:19,174
Give it to him.

689
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:31,394
- You don't really want me to--
- Give it to him.

690
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:34,124
I guess he don't want it.

691
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:58,148
You were right not to take it.

692
01:04:58,399 --> 01:04:59,816
I'd have killed you.

693
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,004
We could use some rain.

694
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:34,350
You no-good, goddamn
pig-fucking whore!

695
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,771
Sorry, old horse.

696
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:51,951
I brung this for when we kill
them fellows.

697
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:54,370
Figured we could use some now.

698
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:56,873
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

699
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,335
- Come on, it's raining.
- I know it's raining!

700
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:02,587
Give some to the Kid.

701
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:09,135
You think that Kid
really killed five men?

702
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:10,887
No.

703
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:20,063
When he talked about the time
them deputies had the drop on you... .

704
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:26,528
I remember there was three men
you shot, not two.

705
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:29,197
I ain't like that no more, Ned!

706
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,908
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

707
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,914
Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?

708
01:06:38,624 --> 01:06:40,917
If we don't drown first.

709
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,345
Give these keys to the conductor.

710
01:06:53,389 --> 01:06:57,225
He can loose Bob's cuffs
as soon as he's outside the county.

711
01:06:58,144 --> 01:06:59,936
Got my pistols?

712
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,232
I guess you know, Bob...

713
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:09,612
... that if I see you again
I'll just shoot in self-defense.

714
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:18,037
I didn't steal your biographer!

715
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:21,291
He's staying on his own account!

716
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:24,669
He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

717
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,922
The plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!

718
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,300
Without morals or laws!

719
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:34,721
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!

720
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:38,725
It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!

721
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,811
Because they wouldn't have you
in England!

722
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,772
You're a lot of savages!

723
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:48,818
You're all a bunch of bloody savages!
A curse on you!

724
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:53,323
Nobody's going to come...

725
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:57,952
... after what Little Bill done
to that Englishman.

726
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,497
Delilah, can't you get
them tables clean?

727
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:06,669
Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.

728
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,341
- What do they call that face cover?
- A veil.

729
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:13,468
Yeah. Get a veil!

730
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:24,687
Rain's coming.

731
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:26,940
Thank God.

732
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:53,675
You sure?

733
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:07,355
You all right, Will?

734
01:09:17,825 --> 01:09:19,325
Fellow asking for you.

735
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,287
Tonight?
You ain't joshing?

736
01:09:22,538 --> 01:09:24,539
This way, mister.

737
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,875
Must be randy as hell
to come out in this shit.

738
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:41,055
"No, no! You're wrong, Little Bill! "
he said.

739
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:44,600
"That's not a Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J! "

740
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:47,729
He had changed it over.
And I said to him:

741
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:51,065
"Jim, you're a liar and a horse thief!"

742
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:57,447
When he saw nobody would help him,
he started crying...

743
01:09:57,698 --> 01:10:00,283
... and sobbing
and just carrying on.

744
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:04,245
He said, "God, please,
don't kill me, Bill! "

745
01:10:04,455 --> 01:10:06,956
So I said, "Jim, it makes me sick... "

746
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:09,917
Open the window, will you?

747
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:14,422
"... to see a man carrying
two pistols and a Henry rifle...

748
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:17,133
... and crying like a damn baby. "

749
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:19,635
- So you killed him?
- No.

750
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:21,637
But I should have.

751
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:24,599
I can't abide them kind.

752
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,934
You see them in the taverns.

753
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:29,479
Tramps and drunk teamsters.

754
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:31,814
Crazed miners.

755
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:35,985
Sporting their pistols and acting
like they was bad men.

756
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:40,365
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

757
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:46,996
I do not like assassins.

758
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,291
Or men of low character.

759
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,336
Like your friend, English Bob.

760
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:56,005
But, now Bob was no coward.

761
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,467
He wouldn't cry
and carry on like that--

762
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:01,886
Sheriff... .

763
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,848
I don't have any more receptacles.

764
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:09,685
Maybe you should hang the carpenter.

765
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:11,687
What?

766
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:18,444
I was just saying because of the... . 
You hang... .

767
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:20,530
Doesn't matter.

768
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:24,784
What the hell?

769
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:27,203
On a night like this!

770
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:32,542
- Who the hell is it?
- Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

771
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:40,633
Three fellows just come into town.
They're down to Greely's.

772
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:43,219
At least two of them got guns.

773
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:53,479
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

774
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,066
You don't suppose he's up--

775
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:00,027
Jesus, Will!

776
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:01,737
You look like shit.

777
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:09,078
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

778
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:15,334
I saw him.

779
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:18,254
Will, he's dead.

780
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:21,007
No, I saw him, Ned.

781
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:25,511
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.

782
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:30,016
Jesus! You got a fever.

783
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:33,603
- Take a drink, will you?
- Worms were coming out.

784
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,775
Look, I'm going up to see
what's keeping the Kid.

785
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:44,572
Must be getting an advance
from one of the sporting ladies.

786
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:48,284
If I was to... .

787
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:55,791
If it worked out that I could take
a little time for myself... .

788
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,086
I mean you wouldn't... .

789
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,926
I guess you wouldn't want to come.

790
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:28,217
Give me the pistol.

791
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:37,727
I says give me over your pistol.

792
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:41,564
I ain't drunk.

793
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:48,154
Ordinance says you got to turn in
your firearms to my office...

794
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:49,572
... day or night.

795
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:01,584
I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.

796
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:02,918
No.

797
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:05,755
But I ain't... .

798
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,049
I ain't armed.

799
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:13,262
What about your friends upstairs?
They got any pistols?

800
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,352
They ain't armed either.

801
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:22,772
Spilled your whiskey.

802
01:15:24,858 --> 01:15:26,275
What's your name?

803
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:29,445
William...

804
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:33,282
... Hendershot.

805
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:39,455
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

806
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:46,712
... what if I was to say you was
a no-good son of a bitch and a liar?

807
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:53,469
And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul...

808
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:58,808
... I bet you'd show me that pistol
quick and kill me. Isn't that so?

809
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:07,733
Maybe, yeah, I guess.

810
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:10,820
But the fact is...

811
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:14,615
... I ain't carrying no firearm.

812
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:16,325
Get up.

813
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,527
What's this for,
snakes and such?

814
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:57,700
We don't have any snakes in here,
Mr. Hendershot.

815
01:17:02,038 --> 01:17:06,375
It ain't loaded or... . 
Powder's wet.

816
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:11,255
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

817
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:17,052
This is the trash
I was speaking of!

818
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:28,647
They're in all the saloons
in all your prosperous communities!

819
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:29,899
Wichita!

820
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:35,029
Over in Cheyenne!

821
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:39,492
Abilene!

822
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:47,082
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.

823
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:53,339
Hurry up!
You know what to tell Bill.

824
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:57,426
Look for that lone pine.
Miss the pine, you won't find it.

825
01:17:57,677 --> 01:17:59,804
Forget the shirt!
Put the boots on!

826
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:13,692
- What are we going to do about Will?
- Come on, Kid!

827
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:17,196
Let's hope them horses are still there!

828
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:52,648
Let the man out, W. W.

829
01:18:53,441 --> 01:18:57,653
He's desiring to leave the hospitality
of Big Whiskey behind him.

830
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,021
Easy!

831
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:36,775
- She's got to turn a dollar a time.
- Why'd they lit out the back window?

832
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,528
They seen you beating on their friend.

833
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:45,117
- They come for the billiards, honest.
- Billiards?!

834
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:49,705
- They were just passing through?
- They was going to Fort Buford.

835
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,917
You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

836
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:54,877
Innocent?

837
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:56,545
Innocent of what?

838
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:27,743
Jesus, Ned! You done this before?

839
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:30,496
Plenty of times.

840
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,375
His pistol must've jammed.

841
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:40,381
Here. Bring that candle in closer.
I can't see.

842
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:55,938
He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.

843
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:58,732
He wouldn't give it over
and not shoot.

844
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:04,530
He don't look so good.

845
01:21:06,741 --> 01:21:08,534
He didn't even pull his pistol?

846
01:21:08,785 --> 01:21:12,538
- He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
- I'd have pulled my pistol.

847
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,791
You did!
Out of the lady and out the window!

848
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:19,044
- That was your idea! l--
- We got to go.

849
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,423
What? I'm ready for another advance.

850
01:21:22,632 --> 01:21:26,260
- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.

851
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:31,140
Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!

852
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:35,019
We're going to need more food!
About three days' worth.

853
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:36,979
Three days?

854
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:39,606
We can kill them tomorrow.

855
01:21:39,816 --> 01:21:43,986
- I don't kill nobody without him.
- We don't need him! We can do it.

856
01:21:44,237 --> 01:21:45,571
Besides...

857
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:49,158
... he ain't nothing
but a broken-down pig farmer.

858
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:52,536
We'll bring food in the morning,
and some whiskey too!

859
01:21:52,787 --> 01:21:56,040
And some medicine if you got any!

860
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:59,001
Don't it make you sick hearing him?

861
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,794
Don't you ladies worry!

862
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:06,592
Me and Ned, we'll kill them two
sons of bitches for you!

863
01:22:12,348 --> 01:22:13,807
Claudia.

864
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:25,652
- Claudia's not here.
- Is that you, Ned?

865
01:22:27,572 --> 01:22:28,947
I seen him.

866
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:34,286
I seen the Angel of Death.

867
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:37,372
I seen a river, Ned.

868
01:22:38,374 --> 01:22:42,628
- He's got snake eyes.
- Who's got snake eyes?

869
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,880
It's the Angel of Death.

870
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:51,095
I'm scared of dying.

871
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:53,514
Easy, partner.

872
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,016
I seen Claudia too.

873
01:22:56,893 --> 01:23:00,145
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

874
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:03,232
Her face was all covered with worms.

875
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:05,692
Ned, I'm scared.

876
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:08,362
I'm dying.

877
01:23:12,325 --> 01:23:15,369
You won't--
No, don't tell nobody.

878
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,746
Don't tell my kids...

879
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:22,167
... none of the things I done.
You hear me?

880
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:24,253
All right, Will.

881
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,564
He's gonna die, ain't he?

882
01:23:45,066 --> 01:23:46,441
Maybe.

883
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,027
Supposing he does?

884
01:23:52,782 --> 01:23:54,199
We'll bury him.

885
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:56,285
That ain't what I mean.

886
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:03,625
You mean, will I help
you kill them cowboys?

887
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:06,712
I can't spot them myself.

888
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:08,672
But you could.

889
01:24:09,257 --> 01:24:13,385
That big bastard, you could spot him
a half-mile off, I bet.

890
01:24:14,804 --> 01:24:16,471
And if I spot him?

891
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:20,225
Then I ride up close and shoot him.

892
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:24,438
Just like that?

893
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:27,482
I'm a damn killer.
I done it before.

894
01:24:30,486 --> 01:24:32,738
I'm more of a killer than he is.

895
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,158
Yeah?

896
01:25:02,518 --> 01:25:05,604
I thought you was an angel.

897
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,023
You ain't dead.

898
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:17,950
Some big fellow...

899
01:25:19,035 --> 01:25:21,161
... kicked the hell out of me.

900
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,291
I must look like you now.

901
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:30,629
You don't look nothing like me.

902
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:34,174
No offense meant.

903
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:40,347
You got to be the one
those cowboys cut up.

904
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:49,022
My partners, Ned and that Kid...

905
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:51,275
... they around?

906
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:55,153
They went out scouting
when your fever broke.

907
01:25:56,072 --> 01:25:57,197
Scouting?

908
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:00,033
Out to the Bar T...

909
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:02,327
... looking for them.

910
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,208
How long I been here?

911
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:10,836
Three days.

912
01:26:12,422 --> 01:26:14,047
Are you hungry or... ?

913
01:26:14,757 --> 01:26:16,550
Three days?

914
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:18,343
I ought to be... .

915
01:26:30,606 --> 01:26:33,025
I thought I was gone.

916
01:26:35,611 --> 01:26:39,740
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this...

917
01:26:40,575 --> 01:26:43,118
... trees,
but I'm sure noticing now.

918
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,621
Thought I was dying for sure.

919
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,083
I brought your hat.

920
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,961
You left it down at Greely's.

921
01:26:53,629 --> 01:26:54,963
Thanks.

922
01:26:56,841 --> 01:26:58,216
That sheriff... .

923
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:02,220
- He still looking for me?
- Little Bill?

924
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:05,223
No, he thinks you went south.

925
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:11,355
Are you really gonna
kill them cowboys?

926
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:13,774
I guess.

927
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:17,069
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

928
01:27:18,654 --> 01:27:21,406
Them other two, your friends...

929
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:24,993
... they been taking
advances on the payment.

930
01:27:25,828 --> 01:27:27,245
Advances?

931
01:27:29,165 --> 01:27:32,292
- Free ones.
- Free ones?

932
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:36,088
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

933
01:27:38,007 --> 01:27:39,257
I see.

934
01:27:43,012 --> 01:27:45,097
Would you like a free one?

935
01:27:53,356 --> 01:27:56,650
No. I guess not.

936
01:27:57,443 --> 01:28:01,113
I didn't mean with me.
I meant...

937
01:28:01,364 --> 01:28:06,034
... Alice and Silky would be happy
to give you a free one if you wanted.

938
01:28:06,202 --> 01:28:08,453
That's all I meant.

939
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:12,207
I didn't mean...

940
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,545
... I didn't want a free one
because you been cut up and all.

941
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:21,299
What I said about you looking like me,
that ain't true.

942
01:28:21,884 --> 01:28:23,718
You ain't ugly like me.

943
01:28:25,179 --> 01:28:28,682
It's just that we both got scars.

944
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:34,354
You're a beautiful woman,
and if I wanted a free one...

945
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,233
... I'd want it with you
more than the other two.

946
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:41,987
It's just that...

947
01:28:42,738 --> 01:28:45,157
... I can't on account of my wife.

948
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:52,998
Your wife?

949
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:57,377
Yeah. You see?

950
01:29:02,091 --> 01:29:03,925
I admire you for that.

951
01:29:04,594 --> 01:29:07,053
For being true to your wife.

952
01:29:08,097 --> 01:29:10,223
I've known a lot of men...

953
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:13,894
... who weren't.

954
01:29:16,272 --> 01:29:17,731
I suppose.

955
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:26,031
Is she back in Kansas?

956
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:29,201
Yeah.

957
01:29:30,244 --> 01:29:32,913
She's watching over my young ones.

958
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:41,254
- Hang on!
- Get the damn iron!

959
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:52,807
Jesus, fellas!

960
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:06,947
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

961
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:10,575
I'm pinned, boys!

962
01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:13,620
Better finish him, Ned.

963
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:16,164
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

964
01:30:16,457 --> 01:30:18,333
He got the boy's horse.

965
01:30:19,043 --> 01:30:21,419
Finish him before he gets clear.

966
01:30:24,173 --> 01:30:26,091
Get behind them rocks.

967
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:28,134
Get over there!

968
01:30:31,514 --> 01:30:35,642
What happened? He ain't killed?!
What's going on?

969
01:30:36,018 --> 01:30:38,478
He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.

970
01:30:38,854 --> 01:30:41,314
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?

971
01:30:41,691 --> 01:30:44,484
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?

972
01:30:49,448 --> 01:30:50,490
Shoot!

973
01:31:04,088 --> 01:31:06,464
I ain't very good with one of these.

974
01:31:12,096 --> 01:31:14,514
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!

975
01:31:16,726 --> 01:31:18,059
Did you get him?

976
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:20,145
Where is he?

977
01:31:20,396 --> 01:31:27,485
How many more shots do I have?

978
01:31:31,032 --> 01:31:34,326
- Two.
- Two.

979
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:45,337
Did you get him?

980
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:04,564
Here, reload this.

981
01:32:05,775 --> 01:32:08,068
- You missed him.
- I got him.

982
01:32:09,111 --> 01:32:11,946
They shot me, boys.

983
01:32:12,114 --> 01:32:13,406
He ain't killed.

984
01:32:14,116 --> 01:32:15,867
Maybe, maybe not.

985
01:32:16,452 --> 01:32:18,703
Got him through the gut, I think.

986
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:24,751
Think he'll die?

987
01:32:27,171 --> 01:32:29,756
You think we killed him?

988
01:32:36,555 --> 01:32:37,931
Yeah.

989
01:32:39,183 --> 01:32:42,477
We killed him, I guess.

990
01:32:46,148 --> 01:32:48,066
I'm dying, boys!

991
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:52,404
Then you shouldn't have cut up
no woman, you asshole!

992
01:32:57,993 --> 01:33:00,704
Jesus, I'm so thirsty!

993
01:33:03,499 --> 01:33:06,751
Give me some water, please!

994
01:33:07,169 --> 01:33:08,503
Please, Slim!

995
01:33:09,672 --> 01:33:11,297
I'm bleeding, Slim!

996
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:18,263
Give him a drink of water,
goddamn it!

997
01:33:22,351 --> 01:33:26,438
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't gonna shoot!

998
01:33:28,482 --> 01:33:31,735
- You ain't gonna shoot?
- No.

999
01:33:33,863 --> 01:33:35,613
Hold on, Davey-boy!

1000
01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:38,324
Here I come now!

1001
01:33:44,874 --> 01:33:46,833
Don't shoot me,
you bastards!

1002
01:33:50,379 --> 01:33:51,671
Shit!

1003
01:34:01,557 --> 01:34:03,183
They take him water?

1004
01:34:05,895 --> 01:34:08,188
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

1005
01:34:08,397 --> 01:34:10,023
Hold on now!

1006
01:34:18,783 --> 01:34:22,327
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

1007
01:34:31,253 --> 01:34:33,087
When will we double back?

1008
01:34:33,798 --> 01:34:35,548
After a ways.

1009
01:34:36,926 --> 01:34:38,176
Not me.

1010
01:34:38,928 --> 01:34:44,265
- I'm heading back down to Kansas.
- We got to kill the other one first.

1011
01:34:44,433 --> 01:34:48,561
With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

1012
01:34:48,729 --> 01:34:52,607
We'll shoot him and head back
with the money.

1013
01:34:53,776 --> 01:34:56,945
- Do you want the Spencer?
- It's no time to quit.

1014
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:59,697
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!

1015
01:34:59,949 --> 01:35:02,700
I'll see you, Will.
So long, Kid.

1016
01:35:11,168 --> 01:35:14,754
Here. I ain't no good
with that damn thing.

1017
01:35:15,256 --> 01:35:19,968
Me and the Kid'll head over
to that ranch and we'll shoot him.

1018
01:35:20,427 --> 01:35:24,305
We'll meet up with you,
get our money, and go back together.

1019
01:35:24,932 --> 01:35:27,392
Suppose he don't go back
to the ranch?

1020
01:35:27,768 --> 01:35:31,771
He ain't going into town
or stay out in the open country.

1021
01:35:32,106 --> 01:35:34,065
He'll hole up at that ranch.

1022
01:35:35,943 --> 01:35:37,402
I ain't waiting.

1023
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:40,530
I'll look in on your young ones.

1024
01:35:47,288 --> 01:35:50,290
Forget what the Kid said
about the money.

1025
01:35:50,499 --> 01:35:53,042
I'll bring your share.

1026
01:35:55,838 --> 01:35:57,422
Kid's full of shit.

1027
01:36:25,618 --> 01:36:27,827
Just doing some repairs up here.

1028
01:36:28,203 --> 01:36:30,038
They killed one of them cowboys.

1029
01:36:34,126 --> 01:36:35,376
Shit!

1030
01:36:36,879 --> 01:36:41,424
Parson said he saw three men,
right after sunup, headed east.

1031
01:36:41,675 --> 01:36:46,137
One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten gray.

1032
01:36:46,722 --> 01:36:50,975
He didn't know what the third one
was on, maybe an appaloosa.

1033
01:36:51,226 --> 01:36:55,313
Amos says to ask if the county
will pay for feed for all the horses.

1034
01:36:55,564 --> 01:36:58,858
Witherspoon won't sell us
no more shells without pay.

1035
01:36:59,109 --> 01:37:00,735
Hell, use my dogs!

1036
01:37:00,986 --> 01:37:03,237
Then the county's got
to be responsible.

1037
01:37:04,114 --> 01:37:08,660
Get on out there to the Bar T
and make sure that other cowboy...

1038
01:37:08,911 --> 01:37:11,496
... stays put
and don't expose himself.

1039
01:37:21,507 --> 01:37:23,841
I didn't think they'd really do it.

1040
01:37:24,468 --> 01:37:27,345
Think they come up
from Kansas to fuck us?

1041
01:37:30,724 --> 01:37:34,102
That Kid, he's just a boy
and the other one...

1042
01:37:34,353 --> 01:37:37,230
... Will, the nice one,
being so true to his wife... .

1043
01:37:37,481 --> 01:37:40,024
Wife?
He ain't got no wife.

1044
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:43,361
- Yes, he does. He--
- He ain't got no wife.

1045
01:37:43,862 --> 01:37:45,697
Not above ground, anyways.

1046
01:37:51,787 --> 01:37:53,204
Murdering whores!

1047
01:37:54,373 --> 01:37:57,792
He had it coming!
He had it coming for what he done!

1048
01:37:58,127 --> 01:38:01,963
And the other one too!
Both of them for what they done!

1049
01:38:12,141 --> 01:38:13,558
We got one!

1050
01:38:15,978 --> 01:38:18,646
We got one, sheriff!
Out by Cow Creek!

1051
01:38:18,981 --> 01:38:21,357
- Is he alive?
- Hell, yeah!

1052
01:38:21,608 --> 01:38:26,237
Bunch of us from Bar T went looking
because they killed one of our own.

1053
01:38:26,572 --> 01:38:29,741
Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.

1054
01:38:30,075 --> 01:38:31,325
He admit it?

1055
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:35,747
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

1056
01:38:36,498 --> 01:38:37,999
They messing him up?

1057
01:38:39,585 --> 01:38:41,085
Little bit.

1058
01:38:44,757 --> 01:38:48,760
Get out there. Find out what happened
to those other two!

1059
01:39:11,867 --> 01:39:14,035
See anything out there, Buck?

1060
01:39:14,286 --> 01:39:18,122
Hell, yes!
Seen about 200 fellows packing rifles.

1061
01:39:18,373 --> 01:39:22,668
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

1062
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,214
I said, "How much?" They says, "Five. "
I said, "Dollars?"

1063
01:39:26,465 --> 01:39:27,715
They said, "Cents. "

1064
01:39:27,966 --> 01:39:29,467
I said, "Sold. "

1065
01:39:31,136 --> 01:39:32,804
Well, I ain't worried!

1066
01:39:33,138 --> 01:39:36,641
Because I got me some protection.

1067
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,459
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.

1068
01:40:03,627 --> 01:40:07,421
- Any names?
- Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.

1069
01:40:10,008 --> 01:40:11,259
Bring him in.

1070
01:40:14,263 --> 01:40:17,932
You'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here...

1071
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,309
... all about your two friends.

1072
01:40:20,727 --> 01:40:26,065
I'll want the names and whereabouts
of those son of a bitches.

1073
01:40:39,746 --> 01:40:41,372
Sure is ripe.

1074
01:40:43,041 --> 01:40:44,876
Going to get a lot riper.

1075
01:40:46,295 --> 01:40:47,879
Think he's still in there?

1076
01:40:49,464 --> 01:40:51,132
He's in there.

1077
01:40:51,967 --> 01:40:55,803
He's holding on to his shit
like it was money.

1078
01:40:55,971 --> 01:40:57,388
He's in there.

1079
01:40:57,890 --> 01:41:01,225
Tell me right off if you see him.

1080
01:41:02,477 --> 01:41:04,896
You won't shoot him your own self?

1081
01:41:05,063 --> 01:41:07,773
You can shoot him.

1082
01:41:44,394 --> 01:41:47,438
Now you and Mr. Quincy and... .

1083
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:50,149
What was the young fellow's name?

1084
01:41:53,904 --> 01:41:55,488
Elroy Tate.

1085
01:42:00,369 --> 01:42:02,703
No, that's not what you said.

1086
01:42:03,163 --> 01:42:06,123
- Hell if it ain't!
- No, you said:

1087
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:09,460
"Elroy Quincy out of Medicine Hat...

1088
01:42:11,213 --> 01:42:13,965
... and Henry Tate out of Cheyenne. "

1089
01:42:14,466 --> 01:42:18,302
Hell if I did.

1090
01:42:20,514 --> 01:42:23,849
Go get them whores that pumped
these boys that night.

1091
01:42:24,101 --> 01:42:26,143
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

1092
01:42:26,478 --> 01:42:28,145
Go on and get them!

1093
01:42:37,197 --> 01:42:41,409
Them whores are going to tell
different lies than you.

1094
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:47,456
And when their lies
ain't the same as your lies... .

1095
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:50,376
Well, I ain't going to hurt no woman.

1096
01:42:51,503 --> 01:42:53,462
But I'm going to hurt you.

1097
01:42:55,924 --> 01:42:58,092
Not gentle like before...

1098
01:42:59,636 --> 01:43:01,387
... but bad.

1099
01:43:17,654 --> 01:43:19,113
Where you going?

1100
01:43:19,281 --> 01:43:21,449
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish.

1101
01:43:21,783 --> 01:43:24,035
To protect me while I take a dump?

1102
01:43:24,286 --> 01:43:26,454
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

1103
01:43:26,705 --> 01:43:29,874
- I'll go.
- Yeah, you can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

1104
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:34,003
Hell with him. He ain't polite,
he should get shot.

1105
01:43:37,466 --> 01:43:38,799
Is that him?

1106
01:43:39,051 --> 01:43:40,676
Yeah, that's him.

1107
01:43:44,473 --> 01:43:48,351
All right, Kid. Go get him.
He's all yours.

1108
01:44:23,845 --> 01:44:24,970
Assassins!

1109
01:44:28,975 --> 01:44:30,351
Shoot him!

1110
01:44:45,992 --> 01:44:47,535
Come on, goddamn it!

1111
01:45:04,636 --> 01:45:06,053
Did you get him?

1112
01:45:18,942 --> 01:45:20,025
Cover me.

1113
01:45:22,571 --> 01:45:24,947
- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!

1114
01:46:02,027 --> 01:46:04,612
Was it like that in the old days?

1115
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,823
Everybody riding out, shooting...

1116
01:46:08,283 --> 01:46:12,203
... smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?

1117
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:15,372
I guess so.

1118
01:46:19,461 --> 01:46:21,962
Shit, I thought they'd get us.

1119
01:46:23,131 --> 01:46:25,132
I was even scared a little.

1120
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:26,717
For a minute.

1121
01:46:29,471 --> 01:46:31,472
You ever scared in them days?

1122
01:46:33,725 --> 01:46:35,142
I can't remember.

1123
01:46:36,478 --> 01:46:39,522
I was drunk most of the time.

1124
01:46:45,403 --> 01:46:47,988
I shot that fucker three times!

1125
01:46:49,491 --> 01:46:53,410
He was taking a shit,
went for his pistol and I blazed away.

1126
01:46:53,578 --> 01:46:54,954
First shot...

1127
01:46:56,748 --> 01:46:58,958
... I got him right in the chest.

1128
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:05,714
- Say, Will?
- Yeah?

1129
01:47:08,176 --> 01:47:09,760
That was the first one.

1130
01:47:11,179 --> 01:47:12,555
First one what?

1131
01:47:14,933 --> 01:47:16,767
First one I ever killed.

1132
01:47:18,311 --> 01:47:19,395
Yeah?

1133
01:47:20,772 --> 01:47:23,190
You know how I said I shot five men?

1134
01:47:24,609 --> 01:47:26,193
It weren't true.

1135
01:47:28,613 --> 01:47:31,907
That Mexican with the knife?

1136
01:47:32,117 --> 01:47:36,453
I just busted his leg with a shovel.
I didn't kill him or nothing.

1137
01:47:39,749 --> 01:47:43,085
You sure killed
the hell out of that fellow today.

1138
01:47:44,921 --> 01:47:46,505
Hell, yeah!

1139
01:47:49,968 --> 01:47:52,970
Killed the hell out of him, didn't l?

1140
01:47:53,221 --> 01:47:56,265
Three shots and he was taking a shit.

1141
01:48:02,814 --> 01:48:04,189
Take a drink, Kid.

1142
01:48:15,076 --> 01:48:16,952
Jesus Christ!

1143
01:48:29,424 --> 01:48:31,300
It don't seem real.

1144
01:48:32,844 --> 01:48:35,971
How he ain't gonna
never breath again, ever.

1145
01:48:36,931 --> 01:48:38,265
How he's dead.

1146
01:48:40,101 --> 01:48:42,686
And the other one too.

1147
01:48:44,481 --> 01:48:47,775
On account of pulling a trigger.

1148
01:48:49,694 --> 01:48:52,988
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.

1149
01:48:54,199 --> 01:48:57,034
You take away all he's got...

1150
01:48:57,202 --> 01:48:59,411
... and all he's ever gonna have.

1151
01:49:04,876 --> 01:49:06,877
I guess they had it coming.

1152
01:49:12,884 --> 01:49:15,135
We all have it coming, Kid.

1153
01:49:29,734 --> 01:49:32,653
I was watching
that you weren't followed.

1154
01:49:34,072 --> 01:49:39,284
Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.

1155
01:49:44,999 --> 01:49:48,544
- You want to help me count this?
- I trust you.

1156
01:49:48,795 --> 01:49:51,213
Don't go trusting me too much.

1157
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:55,426
In fact, we'll give Ned his share
together.

1158
01:49:55,677 --> 01:49:58,303
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.

1159
01:49:58,555 --> 01:49:59,930
Ned's share?

1160
01:50:02,892 --> 01:50:04,935
He went south.
We'll catch up.

1161
01:50:05,687 --> 01:50:07,479
He's dead.

1162
01:50:10,859 --> 01:50:13,444
What do you mean, dead?

1163
01:50:13,611 --> 01:50:16,405
He went south yesterday.
He ain't dead.

1164
01:50:16,948 --> 01:50:19,533
They killed him.
I thought you knew.

1165
01:50:19,826 --> 01:50:21,702
Nobody killed Ned!

1166
01:50:21,953 --> 01:50:24,663
He didn't kill anyone.
He went south!

1167
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:26,915
Why would anybody kill Ned?

1168
01:50:29,502 --> 01:50:30,753
Who killed him?

1169
01:50:31,546 --> 01:50:32,796
Little Bill.

1170
01:50:33,131 --> 01:50:35,632
The Bar T boys caught him...

1171
01:50:36,009 --> 01:50:38,051
... and Little Bill beat him up.

1172
01:50:38,219 --> 01:50:43,140
He was making him answer questions,
beating him up. Then Ned just died.

1173
01:50:43,475 --> 01:50:46,018
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

1174
01:50:46,186 --> 01:50:47,644
A sign on him?

1175
01:50:48,396 --> 01:50:49,980
In front of Greely's.

1176
01:50:50,315 --> 01:50:52,566
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

1177
01:50:56,988 --> 01:51:00,282
These questions he was asking...

1178
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:02,701
... what kind were they?

1179
01:51:05,455 --> 01:51:08,832
About where you and him was.

1180
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,501
Then what?

1181
01:51:11,586 --> 01:51:15,923
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse.

1182
01:51:16,925 --> 01:51:19,802
So Little Bill killed him
for what we done?

1183
01:51:20,053 --> 01:51:21,428
Not on purpose.

1184
01:51:22,347 --> 01:51:26,350
But he started hurting him worse.
Making him tell stuff.

1185
01:51:26,684 --> 01:51:28,227
First, Ned wouldn't talk.

1186
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:33,899
Then Little Bill hurt him so bad,
he said who you was.

1187
01:51:34,859 --> 01:51:38,987
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri.

1188
01:51:39,155 --> 01:51:42,157
Little Bill said, "The one
who dynamited...

1189
01:51:42,408 --> 01:51:45,744
... the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?"

1190
01:51:45,912 --> 01:51:49,039
Ned said you done a lot worse.
Said you was...

1191
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:52,960
... more cold-blooded than Will Bonney.
Said if he hurt Ned again...

1192
01:51:53,211 --> 01:51:58,298
... you'd come kill him
like you killed a U. S. marshal in '70.

1193
01:52:03,054 --> 01:52:06,265
That didn't scare him, did it?

1194
01:52:07,225 --> 01:52:08,851
No, sir.

1195
01:52:16,484 --> 01:52:18,318
Give me your Schofield.

1196
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:19,987
What for, Will?

1197
01:52:20,154 --> 01:52:24,032
- Give it to me.
- Yeah. Sure.

1198
01:52:28,621 --> 01:52:30,414
You want it, keep it.

1199
01:52:30,665 --> 01:52:32,040
I won't use it.

1200
01:52:34,627 --> 01:52:36,712
I won't kill nobody no more.

1201
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,925
I ain't like you, Will.

1202
01:52:45,972 --> 01:52:49,099
You better ride on back, miss.

1203
01:52:52,645 --> 01:52:55,230
Go on, keep all of it.
It's yours.

1204
01:52:56,107 --> 01:52:58,984
What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?

1205
01:53:00,069 --> 01:53:03,071
I'd rather be blind and ragged
than dead.

1206
01:53:04,449 --> 01:53:08,410
You don't have to worry, Kid.
I ain't going to kill you.

1207
01:53:08,912 --> 01:53:10,996
You're the only friend I got.

1208
01:53:18,922 --> 01:53:23,467
Take this money and give my half
and Ned's half to my kids.

1209
01:53:24,052 --> 01:53:27,596
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally.

1210
01:53:27,847 --> 01:53:30,557
You keep the rest.
Get them spectacles.

1211
01:53:30,808 --> 01:53:32,559
You'll go kill Little Bill?

1212
01:53:33,019 --> 01:53:37,105
Stay clear of folks you see.
There'll be a lot out to hang you.

1213
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:38,982
Get going.

1214
01:54:22,777 --> 01:54:27,030
I'll say this just one more time,
so don't ask me again!

1215
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:32,869
Those on today's posse got one drink
coming from the county budget!

1216
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:37,124
And those who rode yesterday
get one for that too.

1217
01:54:38,418 --> 01:54:39,960
Hold it!

1218
01:54:40,211 --> 01:54:44,673
That's two! After that, it comes
out of your own pocket! You hear?

1219
01:54:44,924 --> 01:54:47,968
- Yes, sir.
- We'll pull out early in the morning.

1220
01:54:48,386 --> 01:54:52,764
We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.

1221
01:54:53,725 --> 01:54:56,351
We'll divide up into four parties!

1222
01:54:56,602 --> 01:55:00,564
We'll hit all the farms and trails
in a big circle.

1223
01:55:00,815 --> 01:55:05,152
We're bound to find somebody
who's seen these skunks.

1224
01:55:22,587 --> 01:55:24,838
Who owns this shithole?

1225
01:55:34,348 --> 01:55:37,726
You, fat man. Speak up.

1226
01:55:40,354 --> 01:55:42,814
I own this establishment.

1227
01:55:45,276 --> 01:55:48,945
I bought it from Greely for $1000.

1228
01:55:50,364 --> 01:55:51,990
Better clear out.

1229
01:55:54,952 --> 01:55:57,913
Hold it!

1230
01:56:07,131 --> 01:56:10,217
Sir, you are a cowardly
son of a bitch!

1231
01:56:11,219 --> 01:56:13,178
You just shot an unarmed man.

1232
01:56:13,638 --> 01:56:15,680
He should've armed himself...

1233
01:56:15,932 --> 01:56:18,683
... if he's going to decorate his saloon
with my friend.

1234
01:56:19,393 --> 01:56:22,229
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri...

1235
01:56:22,396 --> 01:56:24,397
... killer of women and children.

1236
01:56:25,066 --> 01:56:26,483
That's right.

1237
01:56:28,194 --> 01:56:30,153
I killed women and children.

1238
01:56:31,697 --> 01:56:35,575
Killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.

1239
01:56:36,828 --> 01:56:39,496
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

1240
01:56:40,331 --> 01:56:42,666
For what you did to Ned.

1241
01:56:46,838 --> 01:56:48,755
You boys better move away.

1242
01:56:59,225 --> 01:57:03,395
All right, gentlemen.
He's got one barrel left.

1243
01:57:04,272 --> 01:57:06,439
When he fires it,
use your pistols...

1244
01:57:06,691 --> 01:57:10,944
... and shoot him down
like the mangy scoundrel he is!

1245
01:57:24,041 --> 01:57:26,501
Misfire! Kill the son of a bitch!

1246
01:58:03,331 --> 01:58:07,459
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

1247
01:58:52,129 --> 01:58:53,797
I'm shot! I'm shot!

1248
01:58:54,298 --> 01:58:55,632
You ain't shot.

1249
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:04,641
I don't have a gun.
I am not armed.

1250
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:07,560
Pick up that rifle.

1251
01:59:09,522 --> 01:59:10,814
Pick it up.

1252
01:59:13,192 --> 01:59:14,276
Shells too.

1253
01:59:27,498 --> 01:59:28,957
You killed Little Bill.

1254
01:59:30,501 --> 01:59:32,002
Sure you ain't armed?

1255
01:59:34,422 --> 01:59:36,339
I'm not.
I don't have a gun.

1256
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:39,301
I've never had a gun.
I'm a writer!

1257
01:59:40,761 --> 01:59:42,262
A writer?

1258
01:59:43,055 --> 01:59:45,181
- Letters and such?
- Books.

1259
01:59:45,891 --> 01:59:47,434
Books.

1260
01:59:47,601 --> 01:59:51,521
I don't believe it, you killed five men.
Single-handed.

1261
02:00:00,114 --> 02:00:03,074
- That's a Spencer rifle, right?
- Right.

1262
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,667
Who'd you kill first?

1263
02:00:16,589 --> 02:00:18,840
"When confronted by superior numbers...

1264
02:00:19,091 --> 02:00:23,136
... an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first. "

1265
02:00:23,304 --> 02:00:27,640
Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.

1266
02:00:27,808 --> 02:00:29,851
I was lucky in the order.

1267
02:00:30,811 --> 02:00:34,814
I'm always lucky
when it comes to killing folks.

1268
02:00:35,691 --> 02:00:39,444
That so? Who was next?
Clyde, right?

1269
02:00:39,695 --> 02:00:42,405
You killed Clyde,
or it was Deputy Andy--

1270
02:00:42,656 --> 02:00:45,283
All I can tell you is,
who'll be last.

1271
02:01:21,946 --> 02:01:23,905
I don't deserve this.

1272
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:27,534
To die like this.

1273
02:01:30,371 --> 02:01:32,455
I was building a house.

1274
02:01:33,374 --> 02:01:36,042
got nothing to do with it.

1275
02:01:38,754 --> 02:01:42,173
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

1276
02:01:48,597 --> 02:01:50,014
Yeah.

1277
02:02:21,505 --> 02:02:23,631
All right, I'm coming out!

1278
02:02:24,049 --> 02:02:26,843
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!

1279
02:02:27,428 --> 02:02:29,929
Anyone takes a shot at me...

1280
02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:35,477
... I'm not only going to kill him,
but his wife and all his friends.

1281
02:02:35,811 --> 02:02:38,062
And burn his damn house down!

1282
02:02:45,404 --> 02:02:47,197
Nobody better shoot!

1283
02:03:02,755 --> 02:03:04,839
Charley, go ahead.
Shoot him!

1284
02:03:18,979 --> 02:03:20,313
I can't.

1285
02:03:20,773 --> 02:03:23,566
Hell, no!
I ain't no deputy!

1286
02:03:43,462 --> 02:03:46,089
You better bury Ned right!

1287
02:03:46,674 --> 02:03:50,385
You better not cut up
nor otherwise harm no whores!

1288
02:03:54,306 --> 02:03:58,685
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons of bitches.

1289
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,501
