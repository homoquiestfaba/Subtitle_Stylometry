2
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,240
Son, will you turn off that wretched puppet?

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,760
Brush your teeth.

4
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
-No, * a puppet.$
-Beg your pardon?

5
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,200
He's not a puppet. Howdy-Doody is real.

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,640
-He's real!
-No, it's a dee-dee-doo-doo.

7
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,480
-You have to say good night.
-Ohhh!

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,200
And remember, you have to be asleep, when he comes down the chimney.

9
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,320
It's not even a chimney, Pop.

10
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,240
Oh, he has his ways.

11
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,480
-Then I'll wait up, watch him do it!
-Nonsense!

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,800
-OK, I wanna a story then.
-No, no, no, no stories tonight.

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Just one. And then I'll go to bed, right away!

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,600
And then I'll brush my teeth, I promise!

15
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,680
It is said that at the dawn of time...

16
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,000
...man, beast and all the magic beings lived together under the Aislin ...

17
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
...the father tree.

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,720
But man has been created with a hole in his heart.

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,280
A hole, that no possession, power or knowledge could fill.

20
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,800
And in his infinite greed, man dreamt of expanding his dominion over the entire earth.

21
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,800
The blood of many an elf, ogre and goblin was split in that wall with man.

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,080
And King Balor, the one armed king of Elfland, watched the slaughter in dread and despair.

23
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,680
But one day, the master of the goblin blacksmith offered to build the king a golden mechanical army...

24
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,720
70 times 70 soldiers that would never know hunger and could not be stopped.

25
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,920
Prince Nuada begged his father to agree.

26
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,560
"Build me this army." the King said.

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
So a magical crown was forged...

28
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,280
...that would allow those royal blood to command the golden army if unchallenged.

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm the king Balor, leader of the golden army...

30
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,680
Is there anyone who disputes my right?

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,200
-In his throne room, no one challenged his word.
-Wait...

32
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,520
What if someone challenge him, they'll have a fight?

33
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,120
Most likely, a challenge must be answered.

34
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,880
-But do you want to hear the end of this story or not?
-Yes, please.

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,040
So, the world was changed.

36
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,760
And the next time the humans marched, they felt the earth tremble beneath their feet.

37
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,920
...and saw the sky darken with monstrous shapes.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,280
The golden army had no remorse, felt no loyalty or pain.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,240
And King Balor's heart grew heavy with regret.

40
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,280
So he called a truce and divided the crown in three pieces...

41
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,840
One of the humans and two for himself.

42
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,920
In exchange, man would keep to the cities, and magical beings would own the forests.

43
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,400
This truce will be honored by their sons, and sons of their sons, until the end of the time.

44
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,200
But Prince Nuada did not believe in the promises of man...

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,400
And it is said that he went into exile, vowing to return the day his people needed him most.

46
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,040
So the golden army laid dominate, locked inside the earth...

47
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,520
...waiting...

48
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,560
And there it is. to this day, waiting the day the crown is made whole again...

49
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,280
...silent, still, and indestructible.

50
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,760
-What does it mean industible?
-In-des-truct-i-ble.

51
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,160
It means no one can destroy that. Go to sleep, my son.

52
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,040
But it is just a story, right Pops?

53
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,520
-Is it now?
-Yeah. Come on, those guys, they can't be real.

54
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,680
My son... I'm sure you'll find out.

55
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
How long have you been there, my friend?

56
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,080
They are over there.

57
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,480
I bought them today. I haven't fed them... at all.

58
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,480
I'll go up first, you'll follow. And remember, Mr Wink...

59
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,000
...don't be shy.

60
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,560
Next mot, No. 776, is an important * figure...

61
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,520
...a fertility goddess, dated approximately 15.000 to 10.000 BC .

62
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,440
This was founded in a less deposit * in a terrace about 30 meters from Shannon River

63
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,960
And we'll open the biding at $300.000.

64
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
300,000... 325.000, thank you.

65
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,680
350.000, thank you... 375,000

66
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,400
375,000. Going once, going twice,
Sold.

67
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,920
And now we move up to the our item. No.777 ..

68
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,800
A piece from the Royal crown of Bethmora...

69
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:07,120
...*origin speaks saga of sons of heaven and hold the fate of golden army.

70
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,160
And here it is... our next item.

71
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your seats.

72
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,440
The auction will restart shortly. I'm sure it's just a temporary lost of power.

73
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
Now for the first time at auction, a piece of royal crown of Bethmora...

74
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,080
-...coming to us from a long lost culture.
-Lost?

75
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,000
Not at all.

76
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
Forgotten by you perhaps.

77
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,080
Very, very much alive.

78
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,920
Who are you Sir? Sir! Please identify yourself.

79
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,160
-You can not just..
-I am Prince Nuada, Silverlance, son of King Balor.

80
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
And I'm here, Sir...

81
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
...to reclaim what is rightfully mine.

82
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,560
Security! Call security!

83
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,800
What do you think you doing? It is outrageous!

84
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,600
Take what you want. Please, Please! Anything, anything!

85
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
Be quiet.

86
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Sit~ down~!

87
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,640
Proud, empty hole, things you are!

88
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,240
Let this remind you why you once feared the dark...

89
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,040
*This is it. We have to talk.

90
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
Undercover. Can't get the meaning of the word?

91
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,480
Look, we're still government founder, we are still a secret... Although a dirty secret if you ask me.

92
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,720
Officially, we DO NOT exist.

93
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
You see, that's the problem, when we get these...

94
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,720
Subway, highway.

95
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,360
Ahh, Park.

96
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,840
And he posed for this one, and gave him autograph.

97
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,520
I suppress each photo, cellphone video. They cost me a fortune... And they showed on Youtube.

98
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,720
God, I hate Youtube.

99
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,320
He just wants the world outside to know what we do, what he does.

100
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,440
-He loathes me.
-I don't think so.

101
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,120
-Target practice.
-Oh, dear.

102
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,880
And then he posts them around.

103
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,120
You know how that make me feel?

104
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,280
-What's going on?
-Oh, it's Friday.

105
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,360
I tell you, Fish. He hates me. He's out to destroy me. My street creed is low.

106
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,400
-Street creed.
-My mojo.

107
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,600
Washington, they got wondering if I got this stuck.*

108
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,200
Do you think I have an easy job? Do you think I...I enjoy?

109
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,920
Being a pain... in a neck? I... I am...

110
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
I am medicated.

111
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,880
This is not a candy. it's an anti-acid. Yes it's over the counter of medicine.

112
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
This, this is medicine. You see...

113
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm worried because I mean... I am, we are...

114
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:36,463
After all, We are just humble servants.

115
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:42,402
-It's not about you. He's acting out. Things are a little tense with Liz.
-Tense?

116
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:45,802
How tense? Tense how?

117
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,093
You know, the usual. New couple make new justments.

118
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:54,061
-They argue. Sometimes, like everybody else.

119
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:57,267
They have good days, and bad days.

120
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:25,295
-Abe.
-Come Back here!

121
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,006
Manning.

122
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:34,155
Watch it, Boys. She's on fire.

123
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,167
Then again there're the really bad days.

124
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,926
-I'm not afraid of you, you know.
-Oh you should be, look at this mess. Look around!

125
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,550
I have one rule. Don't touch my stuff.

126
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,992
-Oh, I get it. That's your rule.
-One only.

127
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:50,197
Calm, easy.

128
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,416
How's that even possible everything you should stuff. *

129
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,174
The same CD, LP...

130
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,406
Al Green. You can't listen to Al Green on CD!

131
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,702
An a trick? And a track?

132
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:03,439
One day the world gonna realize the mistake. A track was the way to go.

133
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:07,380
Come, kids, you can come out now. That's right, it's all over.

134
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,235
What about me, Red? I need some space.

135
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:17,322
Please, enough. Find my tooth brush.

136
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,681
Tooth brush? Wait a minute.

137
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,060
It's right there!

138
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:29,287
Red, I can't live like this.

139
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:35,855
Oh, Damn. Gotta go. We all gotta go. It's an emergency, right?

140
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,119
-Let's go.
-Red!

141
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:41,506
Hold on a second.

142
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,923
Manning. Watch yourself, Liz.

143
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,515
-Listen.
-Manning.

144
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,516
-We're going to downtown Manhattan.
-It will be fun.

145
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:56,096
Downtown, very dangerous. Dangerous for you and me.

146
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,406
I know that you dream with the outside world. But trust me, it's not that great. The savages that madder* are bad.

147
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:10,329
These... on the other hand... are good. Cuban.

148
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:15,168
-Being seen...
-Bad.

149
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:19,348
I compensated these boxes. I'll give you some more. But...

150
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:22,448
You got to do me a little favor, out there tonight.

151
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:25,974
-You have to be very, very....
-Discreet.

152
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:28,954
-Thank you.
-No welcome.

153
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,129
Invisible. In and out.

154
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:34,102
Really?

155
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,369
Hey, I can be discreet if I wanna be.

156
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:41,422
-I followed you and Maiers, didn't I?
-And then he got transfered to Arctica.*

157
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,808
-Discreet!
-He said he liked the city of cold.

158
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:47,835
Like a shadow

159
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:57,397
Like a shadow in the night.

160
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:15,918
We discovered a few illegally Imported items. it's minus infraction... A gas pocket... maybe detected a gas pocket...*

161
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:26,090
Ok, now FBI agents under my commands are going up there right now, with special gas equipment.

162
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:32,489
Geez, it stinks in here. It's worse than my room.

163
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:39,843
-Say Cheese~!
-Let's go.

164
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,420
If they called us for. It's over.

165
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,740
It's over 70 guests reported.

166
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,040
-We have no survivors, no bodies.
-Same story here, babe.

167
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,630
Don't call me babe.

168
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,439
"Abe"! I said "Abe"!

169
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,550
Wrong Channel!

170
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:26,626
Abe, I think Liz is still mad at me.

171
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,648
-Still the same channel.
-Oh.

172
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,378
-Can I ask you a question?
-No.

173
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:52,122
-Listen, when we get home later, I'm gonna clean up the whole mess.
-That's not the problem.

174
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,248
-What is it?
-Not now.

175
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,340
Abe, what do we got?

176
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,968
Oh, this is Interesting. Both boxes have the royal seal.

177
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,309
...only delivered at time... of war.

178
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,531
Red? We have a company.

179
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,520
Come on, come on, give me some to work with here.

180
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:56,479
-Borrowing creatures.
-How many?

181
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,629
Many. There are no corpses, because there're no leftovers.

182
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,069
Do you notice the floor?

183
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,129
Crap!

184
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:09,861
-Precisely. All these things do is eat and eat, then poo, and then eating again.
-Remind you anyone?

185
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,817
-Abe, What are these things?
-Carcharodon Calcarea.

186
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:18,081
-English! English!
-They're tooth fairies.

187
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:22,995
-Ha!
-No, no, 3rd century, Black Forest, feed mostly on mainly calcium,

188
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:30,499
...bone, skin, organs. But they do go for the teeth first, ha, hence the name "tooth fairies".

189
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,805
I bet you they don't leave money, either.

190
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:46,337
Oh my God!

191
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,659
-Liz... You're pregnant!
-No, I'm not.

192
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:52,309
Yes. You are.

193
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,300
What do you got, Marble?

194
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,725
I may have found one.

195
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,998
It's kind of cute.

196
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,895
Don't go nearer.

197
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,570
Red! We need you here!

198
00:21:57,738 --> 00:21:59,538
Nasty little...

199
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:14,138
Keep firing Abe! Keep firing!

200
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,676
Damn!

201
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,300
Sorry, Lady.

202
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,431
You should be running.

203
00:22:58,442 --> 00:23:01,068
There's a safer upstairs, come to get there!

204
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,511
We need hurry!

205
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,900
Up to the safe! Now!

206
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:18,017
Abe! Up the stairs!

207
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:23,846
Come on Liz, burn them all.

208
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,064
In the safe! In the safe!

209
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:06,731
Fire is mine!

210
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,155
Fire is in me.

211
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:11,717
Red! Stay away from the window!

212
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,220
World~ here I come!

213
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:14,469
What have you done!

214
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,336
Guess we're up.

215
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,413
Hey! Hellboy, over here!

216
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:52,988
Your royal highness!

217
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:00,047
/Welcome Prince Nuada.../

218
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:04,844
/...we honor your return./

219
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,113
Before entering the council chamber, you must...

220
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:13,857
-...surrender your weapons.
-I will NOT.

221
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,260
It is protocol, Sir...

222
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:25,369
...peasant and prince are same...*

223
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,180
/It will be a pleasure to do away with you./

224
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,932
/Please, Brother./

225
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,624
/...give it to me./

226
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:40,153
For you, Sister...

227
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
...anything.

228
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:49,396
According to multiple eye witnesses, lives were in fact in danger.

229
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:53,220
There you have it...Hellboy. But is he really on our side?

230
00:26:53,233 --> 00:27:00,765
-Right Red?
-Yeah, But I'm really wanna be ordinary person, just like you, and you.

231
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:03,184
Hey! Guy, you're missing this!

232
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,029
We are on TV!

233
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,543
Liz! Are you all right?

234
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:10,948
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.

235
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,086
You don't need to do that. You can trust me. My readings are quite accurately.

236
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:16,003
Shut up, Abe!

237
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:19,046
Get your damn hand away from the door!

238
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:25,765
Nothing to fear. Despite the appearances, I bet Red can be excellent father figure.

239
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:33,504
-And what about, what about this guy...walking with a toilet seat on his head.
-Toilet seat!

240
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,239
It's quite obvious! It's a breathing apparatus!!!

241
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:41,066
Abe, I think we got lose of this truck. It sends out the wrong signal.

242
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:46,230
That's our problem? Transportation.

243
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,294
And this girl, with * fire, what's wrong with her.

244
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:51,940
She's cute. She can be on the show.

245
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:56,678
I hate it, when people stare at me. Makes me feel like a freak.

246
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:59,493
You had no right, Red.

247
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:02,878
Oh, Manning! Could you...

248
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:07,317
And gas is phenomena, that it can occur...*

249
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,740
You murdered me. You murdered me.

250
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:23,304
You have ridiculed me.

251
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,240
-You brought this onto yourself.
-What?

252
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:34,146
Washington is sending down a new B.P.R.D agent.

253
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:35,741
A new guy?

254
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,222
-Why?
-To look after you.

255
00:28:45,463 --> 00:28:48,263
Sir... Please.

256
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,038
/Father./

257
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:02,919
/Why?/

258
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:05,738
/Why did you do this to me?/

259
00:29:07,404 --> 00:29:09,724
-/Why?/
-To set us free.

260
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:13,636
-All of us, Father.
-/Break a former truce.../

261
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:16,499
/...In our own town and our home./

262
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,921
The truce is based on shame!

263
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:20,758
The humans...

264
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,113
...the humans have forgotten us, destroy the earth, then for what?

265
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:28,702
Parking lots, shopping malls...

266
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:33,701
...Greed had burned a hole in their hearts, They will NEVER be filled, they will NEVER have enough.

267
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:37,939
/Is this not what humans do/

268
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:41,179
/Is this not in there nature?/

269
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:44,217
Honor? Look at this place!

270
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,115
...Where is the dignity.

271
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:49,427
Father, you were once a proud warrior.

272
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,029
When did you become their pet?

273
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,355
I have returned from exile to wage war...

274
00:29:57,457 --> 00:30:00,134
...and reclaim OUR land, OUR birthright!

275
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,430
And for that I will call upon the help of all my people, and they will answer.

276
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:09,472
The good, the bad...

277
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,396
...and the worst.

278
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:13,797
/My golden amulet!/

279
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:17,191
-/You cannot be that defiant./
-Perhaps, I am.

280
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:19,723
Perhaps, they made me so.

281
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,399
/You hold the amulet.../

282
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:24,957
/... Our green fields are blood stained./

283
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:27,776
/Leave your army to rest./

284
00:30:28,514 --> 00:30:32,114
/Our ritual has ended.... or you will fade away./

285
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,454
We will NOT fade.

286
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:37,128
/For the last time I beg you, my son.../

287
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,899
-/Is this the way you would take your last drink?/
-It is.

288
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:45,605
-I'm sorry, Father.
-/You leave me no choice./

289
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:50,286
/Death!/

290
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:59,860
And you, Sister... are you peace with the King's verdict?

291
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:04,128
I am, my brother... I am.

292
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:07,372
Then very well. Death it is.

293
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:41,921
/I'll always love you, Father./

294
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,739
Now, now for the final piece my sister.

295
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:05,712
Where is she? Where is she?!

296
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,416
Go to find her! Now! Finder her!

297
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:31,746
Excuse me. Excuse me.

298
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:33,341
-Is he here?
-Not yet.

299
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,879
-I'm telling you we don't need this guy.
-Oh, I think we do.

300
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,511
Evidently, this guy is quite a big shot in Washington.

301
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:40,366
-What's his name?
-His name...

302
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,064
...is Johann Krauss.

303
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,051
-Johann Krauss?
-hmm.

304
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:46,808
-Sounds German.
-He's a top man in ecto...

305
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:50,111
-Ectoplasmic
-Yes, thank you. Ectoplasmic research.

306
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:53,271
...comes highly recommended by our European liaison.

307
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:57,420
-Crap.
-Liaison, I love that word, don't you? It's quitey-tweedy.

308
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:58,849
-I don't like German.
-No fingerprints.

309
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,466
-Here he come.
-German makes me nervous.

310
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:04,384
No photo. Dossier says, and I translate "He has a nice....

311
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:06,115
...open face."

312
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,828
Oh my God...

313
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,930
Johann Krauss at your service.

314
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,070
I like him.

315
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:34,082
Look at that, poor little thing.

316
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:39,497
Bought and sold on the black market, crammed into cargo container, smuggled, abused...

317
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:43,208
-It's very expressive hand.
-The seal on the box worries me also.

318
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:46,753
-Organ emblem.
-Yes, from the Bethmora clan, the Suns of the earth.

319
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:50,348
Your higher says you are the brains of the operation. And I must admit I'm impressed.

320
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:55,151
In my file, you'll see Mr Krauss, I work very closely with Abe in his training.

321
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,149
Yeah. OK, Let's see what our little friend here can remember.

322
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,835
Remember you get a little sketchy right after you burned to death.

323
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:01,922
But ..

324
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:07,599
-Maybe St. Malarkey can help.
-No, no no. Ambulant my heaven.

325
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:10,453
-Teleplasty.
-Plastic, very modern.

326
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:17,373
Teleplasty. By which ectoplasmic medium, such as Dr Krauss... can control inanimate things.

327
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,490
...organic, mechanical... dead or alive.

328
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:24,641
Take it, take it all in, my dear.

329
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,324
Very well, there we are.

330
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,511
Get up. Get up. Get up.

331
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,478
Now I have full control of it's limbic system.

332
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,485
Let's see how long I can hold it.

333
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:40,179
What?!

334
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:42,975
*Cue off the tip of my tail.

335
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:49,214
-He says you're rude, brutish, or not very smart.
-Wow.

336
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:57,755
It seems that our little friend here remembers the market sounds and voices.

337
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:01,680
And a particular troll ligament talking in last place his case was open.

338
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,249
The troll market!

339
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:07,279
The troll market? Come on, no one has ever found it.

340
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:09,435
That because it doesn't exist.

341
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:19,563
Krauss, Dr Krauss, sir, our little performance doesn't look so good.

342
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:37,528
There we are. So...

343
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:41,406
Now we know where to begin. Trolls dwell under bridges...

344
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:43,268
You're a genius.

345
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:46,360
By the way, there are over 2000 bridges in New York city.

346
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,709
But Vladimir Vania, 19 century out cult historian, placed the troll market directly under the east end of the Brooklyn Bridge.

347
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,899
-We've already looked there.
-Yes, you have, but not with me, Agent.

348
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,000
Not with me. We're moving in!

349
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,621
-"Not with me, Agent", what an ego!
-I like him.

350
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:26,733
Well, you can keep him.

351
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:32,152
-Am I the only one that thinks this guy is...
-No, no no, don't lean.

352
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,879
Lock 336. The Schuftan time glasses. Could it be?!

353
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:39,309
For three surviving pairs, and if you use them to look, it's troll market.

354
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:44,126
Dr Krauss, what a Kool! The Schuftan time glasses. You are my hero.

355
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,125
Hey! You're the hellboy! You rock me man!

356
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,659
Two more on the wall in front of me, and then three on the alley facing that way.

357
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:58,773
-What do you think of Mr Know-It-All?
-I don't know, too early to tell.

358
00:37:58,857 --> 00:38:00,719
-You're Hellboy!
-I know I'm ugly.

359
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:01,936
Forget it!

360
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,009
We'll talk about it later.

361
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:08,831
Be sure of themselves. And I think... maybe you're intimidating.

362
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:21,117
What's this?

363
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:26,577
Normally we can not see fairy folk and trolls, they generate...

364
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:33,158
...a cloaking aura or a glamor. But in 1878 Emile Schuftan designed and built these.

365
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:38,240
Four crystal diopters penetrate that effect, and reveal the true nature of things.

366
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,593
-Oh, Dr Krauss, they're more beautiful than I imagine.
-You must try them.*

367
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,162
Yes, look at those tight little leather straps.

368
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:49,147
-Intimidating? Huh!

369
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,669
-Mr Krause Sir?
-Krauss, Agent, it's double ss.

370
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,859
SS, right right.

371
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,153
Listen, those gizmos...

372
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:04,389
How do you know they work?

373
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,628
-I have a suspect.
-Give me a vector, Agent Sherman, a vector.

374
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,582
-B 12 the alley, north valley.
-Here's the target, we're coming down.

375
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:15,092
-Keep an eye on it. Be right back.
-This here?

376
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:17,958
-This little old lady? Come on.
-It's a fag worm.

377
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,855
An ugly Scottish troll. They're afraid of Canaries.

378
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:22,797
Oh my God.

379
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:25,160
Canaries?

380
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,443
-What about the kittens?
-She feeds on them.

381
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:31,539
That thing is a She?

382
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,040
Down your foolish, what do you think you are doing?

383
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:57,437
-She's gonna eat the cat!
-You'll make her aware our presents!

384
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,810
-We should use the canary now.
-She's gonna eat!

385
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,817
We should use the bird, Dr Krauss, the bird.

386
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:08,021
-She's gonna eat...
-Stay, * and follow my orders.

387
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:11,271
-I can't sit by!
-You're under my command and you have to obey!

388
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:16,260
Lucy! I'm home!

389
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:20,780
-Yes, dear can I help you?
-Give it up nasty, we can see you.

390
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:23,795
You see me? How?

391
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:26,191
How do you see me?

392
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:29,120
Looking for the entry to the troll market, any clues?

393
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:31,530
Get a little close and I'll rip your heart!

394
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,232
We have to get the old school? Give me the buddy.

395
00:40:36,156 --> 00:40:40,078
-No canary!
-What? You're afraid of this little guy?

396
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:44,283
No more, no more, I'll take you there.

397
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,013
Come on, let's go, you dirty old troll.

398
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,651
Let's go.

399
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:12,181
Agent Sherman, we are going into the troll market. Keep the communication to the minimum.

400
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:17,821
-I like him. See, this is the man who takes charge.
-You think?

401
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:23,015
-He's efficient, he's precise.
-Add resistant to that, and you got yourself a new watch.

402
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:29,886
Dr Krauss is aware of genus command. And he seems like me.

403
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,640
Here we are.

404
00:41:36,654 --> 00:41:38,454
Wow that's some door.

405
00:41:42,514 --> 00:41:45,158
It is a complex combination lock.

406
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:48,635
-What do you think Agent Sapian?
-Not good.

407
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:52,983
-With numbers of symbols on combination, we will be here for days.
-No necessarily...

408
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:55,997
Let me try my technique. Open it Lucy.

409
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:58,882
-I will NOT!
-Pretty please.

410
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:07,813
Tear my eyes out, Stress the insides and my legs and my tongue...

411
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:10,547
I will NEVER open that door!

412
00:42:17,066 --> 00:42:20,424
Is that your investigative technic?

413
00:42:20,463 --> 00:42:22,543
-She said never.
-It's unrcontionable.

414
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,270
That meant he didn't like it.

415
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:30,006
So you're gonna show us how it's done? Mr By-The-Book?

416
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:33,998
-Is that it?
-Yes, I think I will.

417
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:39,879
Very well.

418
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,230
Let me see it. Yes.

419
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:06,212
Gentlemen, welcome to the troll market.

420
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:33,738
/Fresh fish./

421
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,860
/Buy your fresh fish.../

422
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:46,167
Red, there's something really important, and I need to tell you.

423
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:51,564
Liz, you should be here. You'd love it. Nobody is looking at us. We blend right in.

424
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:55,253
-Agent, I said keep communication to minimum. You'll blow out our cover.

425
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:57,685
You know I think he's right.

426
00:43:58,888 --> 00:44:04,538
-I'm breaking you here for sure babe. Just want the radio silent. So...
-Over now.

427
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,208
The royal seal.

428
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:44,106
Red, do you read me?

429
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,236
Yeah, read you, Blue. But there's a watching show I gotta work. I'll get back to you.

430
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,853
Excuse me. sir... sir...

431
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:54,682
Sir, may I ask you something?

432
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,153
Excuse me gentlemen, have you seen anyone purchasing this type of tooth fairy?

433
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:06,739
-No one sells them down here, pal.
-In New Jersey maybe.

434
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:10,087
What about this, then, do you recognize this seal?

435
00:45:10,284 --> 00:45:13,176
Make him go away! Make him go away!

436
00:45:13,204 --> 00:45:15,724
You better go!

437
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:19,372
You may reverse your line.

438
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,259
Don't waste our time! We will not talk!

439
00:45:23,652 --> 00:45:26,613
-Are you sure about that?
-Absolutely.

440
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,413
-You're talking!
-Never!

441
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:32,161
-Never?
-Never Ever Ever!

442
00:45:56,102 --> 00:45:59,154
-Feel a little chatting now?
-He'll never talk.

443
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:02,863
Yes, wait a minute, don't take me anymore.

444
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:04,177
Chicken!

445
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,186
-Who brought the tooth fairies?
-Prince Nuada.

446
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:11,351
They say Prince Nuada broke the truce and now there is talk of war.

447
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,528
A war in human world.

448
00:46:14,865 --> 00:46:16,865
-Sorry Kid.
-That's all right.

449
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:21,046
-What a nice baby.
-I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor.

450
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,855
Yes. Red. I'm following the lead right now.

451
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:36,804
It may turn out to be nothing, but I will let you know soon enough.

452
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:06,943
What you want? Tell me your name.

453
00:47:13,392 --> 00:47:15,192
Follow me.

454
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:19,305
His father left you this map.

455
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:25,141
In it he said lies the secret to the location of the golden army.

456
00:47:26,006 --> 00:47:28,210
Move away, quickly your highness.

457
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:35,329
-Can I help you with something?
-No, thank you, I'm just looking.

458
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,850
You CAN'T go in there!

459
00:47:37,214 --> 00:47:39,534
Sir? Why are you following me?

460
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:43,827
-I was just hoping to find an old map charges...

461
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:46,854
-Why are you following me?
-I was not!

462
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:49,972
Did my brother send you to steal the crown piece?

463
00:47:49,948 --> 00:47:53,829
Your brother? You're solely mistaken. I assure you...

464
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:57,361
Then tell me truthfully, why are you following me?

465
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:03,162
My name is Abraham Sapien.

466
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,791
-There is no such name.
-I don't like it either. But I...

467
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:09,584
-Enough, give me your hand.
-Huh?

468
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,262
Your hand!

469
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:23,548
You are an agent for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.

470
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,690
And your name is...

471
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:30,255
Horrible, I know.

472
00:48:30,412 --> 00:48:33,212
I am Nuala, Princess Nuala.

473
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:37,356
Yes, I know. Forgive me your highness. But...

474
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:41,052
...as you're learning about me, I couldn't help to learn a bit about you myself.

475
00:48:43,132 --> 00:48:46,652
-I know that you need our help.
-I am afraid that there's other way around.

476
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,940
The window, out now. I'll take care of this.

477
00:49:20,512 --> 00:49:22,232
Go! Now go!

478
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,380
-Get out of here, Blue.
-Yes, come with me your highness.

479
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:44,644
You ..

480
00:49:46,268 --> 00:49:48,988
Let me put this as delicately as I can.

481
00:49:56,444 --> 00:50:00,748
Cigar! It was Cuban! Now you pissed me off.

482
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:11,521
Crap!

483
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:30,571
Now stay down!

484
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,731
Damn!

485
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:53,651
Tooth. Happy?

486
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,380
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

487
00:52:17,645 --> 00:52:19,445
Wow, told you.

488
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:33,243
OMG, what have you done, Agent Hellboy, look at this. Now we have to leave.

489
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:35,941
Red, this is Princess Nuala.

490
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:38,854
-Lady.
-We should leave, now!

491
00:53:04,343 --> 00:53:06,343
/So what do you have to tell me?/

492
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:21,284
To wage his war, my brother needs this... the final piece of the Crown of Bethmora.

493
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:25,898
-And the map to the location of golden army chamber.
-The golden army...

494
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:29,499
...the harbingers of death, the unstoppable tide.

495
00:53:31,017 --> 00:53:33,827
Your highness, if you hands the crown piece over to us...

496
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:36,212
No. Where it goes, I go.

497
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:41,086
My father died to uphold the truce with your world. You must honor his noble intentions.

498
00:53:41,056 --> 00:53:44,847
-The lady is in dire danger.
-I take is your are vouching for her, Agent Sapien?

499
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:47,250
Most emphatically, yes I am.

500
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:48,761
Even so...

501
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:53,962
I am sorry, but we simply can not assume such responsibility on our own.

502
00:53:53,995 --> 00:53:56,475
Lady just lost her father, what more do you want?

503
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,008
You may not care, but there are procedures, rules, and little handbooks that...

504
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:05,040
-She's coming with us. You got that, Gasbag?!
-What did you call me?

505
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:05,979
You!

506
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:11,214
You will pay for what happened to my friend down there.

507
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:13,378
Yeah, right. You take checks?

508
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,977
Demon, born from a womb of shadows, sent to destroy their world and you still believe you belong?!

509
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:21,604
Are we going to talk all night, because I'm really sleepy?

510
00:54:24,746 --> 00:54:26,466
No, Brother! No!

511
00:54:38,097 --> 00:54:39,737
Kill him.

512
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,764
-It's just a jumping bean!
-It's going for water! Hurry!

513
00:56:04,913 --> 00:56:09,322
-It's an elemental, the giver of life, and the destroyer.
-Huh?

514
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,545
The Forest God.

515
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,400
Forest God?

516
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:18,028
I'll give him a big baby.

517
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:29,275
Help!

518
00:56:29,236 --> 00:56:32,020
-How can I help you, Ma'am?
-The baby's still inside...

519
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:38,316
Come this way lady, please. There's nothing to worry about, because everything is under control.

520
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,360
Hey, little guy.

521
00:57:15,392 --> 00:57:16,872
Hang on, kid.

522
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,311
Agent Hellboy, leave the child aground, use the weapon!

523
00:58:05,496 --> 00:58:07,696
-You must shoot his energy...
-What?

524
00:58:07,752 --> 00:58:10,941
-The energy *...focus on the head!

525
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:13,531
Shoot it in the head!

526
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:24,833
Aw, Crap.

527
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,433
You gotta trust me little buddy, OK?

528
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,400
You woke up the baby.

529
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,346
Agent hellboy! Take the shot right now!

530
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:17,557
Take it, that's the order! Take the shot! That's an ordering! Hellboy!

531
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:21,518
Shoot it! Shoot it now!

532
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:31,964
Demon! What are you waiting for? This is what you want, isn't it?

533
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:36,757
Look at it. The last of its kind...

534
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:40,133
...like you and I.

535
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,487
If you destroy it, the world will never see its kind again...

536
00:59:48,629 --> 00:59:52,224
You have more in common with us than with them.

537
00:59:52,476 --> 00:59:54,957
You could be a king...

538
00:59:55,636 --> 00:59:57,498
Shoot it! It's getting loose!

539
00:59:57,472 --> 01:00:03,104
-If you cannot command, than you must obey.
-Damn.

540
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:17,787
It is beautiful.

541
01:01:54,957 --> 01:01:58,406
-What have you done to my baby?
-Baby is fine.

542
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:03,738
-The baby is fine!
-Don't move! Hands in air!

543
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,760
-He's got a weapon in his hand!
-That is his hand!

544
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:10,305
Miss, stay away from him, for your safety.

545
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:14,352
He was trying to help, don't you see? He was just try to help!

546
01:02:15,622 --> 01:02:20,217
That's all we do! That's all we've done all these years!

547
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:23,817
We just try to help YOU! YOU!

548
01:02:25,548 --> 01:02:30,155
You freak! We don't need your help!

549
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:45,443
Liz...

550
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:53,774
Let's go home.

551
01:02:54,961 --> 01:03:00,545
...investigation of B.P.R.D. And here's a promotion of inter-spieces marriage assumed...

552
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:04,627
...a threat to traditional families and us federal founds.

553
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:07,421
I didn't touch you yet.

554
01:03:12,058 --> 01:03:13,818
You did a good job out there.

555
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:18,473
Then tell me why I feel so bad.

556
01:03:18,844 --> 01:03:23,971
I mean... I killed that thing, for what?

557
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:29,299
No one likes me, and they're afraid of me.

558
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:32,328
What do we do with that?

559
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:36,192
Red, I don't want you to freak out.

560
01:03:37,925 --> 01:03:44,023
I'm gonna leave... for a little bit. I need time to think.

561
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:48,109
About what? Can you just think it right here?

562
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:52,051
Look, I'll be really really quite, I'll get rid of the cats.

563
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:56,967
Red, why are you with me?

564
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:00,421
Do you need everyone to like you? Everybody?

565
01:04:00,443 --> 01:04:04,941
Or I enough? Think about it.

566
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,480
Blank? No coordinates.

567
01:04:39,778 --> 01:04:42,472
＃Be near me when my light is low,＃

568
01:04:42,502 --> 01:04:45,572
＃When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick,＃

569
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,732
＃And tingle; and the heart is sick,＃

570
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:51,630
＃And all the wheels of Being slow.＃

571
01:04:51,964 --> 01:04:55,233
＃Be near me when the sensuous frame.＃

572
01:04:55,285 --> 01:04:58,050
＃Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust; ＃

573
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,587
-＃And Time, a maniac...＃
-Tennyson.

574
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:04,995
''In Memoriam''. A Beautiful poem. Forgive me I didn't mean to startle you.

575
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:08,170
No, no. I borrow this book... I hope you don't mind.

576
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,904
No, no, no. Please, is your home now.

577
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:13,448
-You're safe here.
-My brother will find me.

578
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,316
-He always does.
-How could he. This location is highly classified secrets.

579
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:19,640
Yes, but I know it, which means he does too.

580
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:24,994
We're twins. Even when as children, a link has bound us, one to the other.

581
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,321
-Something I can't not explain.
-No need.

582
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:34,878
-You... look different.
-Do I? Perhaps my hair?

583
01:05:34,956 --> 01:05:39,432
No, It's your eyes. I can see your eyes.

584
01:05:41,526 --> 01:05:43,806
Just trying a new... look.

585
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:49,468
Is that map?

586
01:05:50,836 --> 01:05:55,120
Yes, it was in the cylinder. There're no coordinates.

587
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:00,425
Perhaps, there's a watermark.

588
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:09,421
You're very brave, vouching for me? How do you know I'm not the enemy bringing me here.

589
01:06:10,143 --> 01:06:12,263
Just what you're saying, just now.

590
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:17,669
From intuition... maybe... a link?

591
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:22,856
Normally I'm able to read up this quite quickly, but...

592
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:25,334
I've never met anyone like you.

593
01:06:27,848 --> 01:06:30,168
No, I like you!

594
01:06:31,953 --> 01:06:33,953
Good night, Abraham.

595
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:39,532
Good night, Princess, Your highness, Your Ma'am... Ma'am?

596
01:07:11,325 --> 01:07:13,605
Good night, Agent Hellboy.

597
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:25,621
-Look, Agent, I know you don't like me, but I could take away your badge.
-Never have one. Keep asking though.

598
01:07:26,172 --> 01:07:30,346
You'll learn to obey me, follow the protocol, and stay focüse/focus all time.

599
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:35,852
That word, "focüse"? Yeah with your accent, I wouldn't use that much.

600
01:07:35,883 --> 01:07:39,527
-I knew Professor Broome, young man.
-You don't know Professor Broome.

601
01:07:39,544 --> 01:07:43,595
-Yes I did, after I left, he designed this tangency.
-Shut up!

602
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:47,862
-A wonderful man, even then he was very worried about your future.
-Stop!

603
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:53,227
-Right now.
-Or what? Are you threatening me?

604
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:55,443
Because I think I can take you.

605
01:07:57,557 --> 01:08:00,077
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

606
01:08:02,372 --> 01:08:05,653
I couldn't hear you from... all the way over there.

607
01:08:05,786 --> 01:08:09,608
I can take you... because you have one fatal flaw.

608
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,621
-Oh, I wanna hear it.
-No, you don't, you can't take criticism.

609
01:08:13,727 --> 01:08:17,505
-Try me.
-Can't - take - it.

610
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,781
What's my flaw ~?

611
01:08:21,513 --> 01:08:27,960
Your temper. It gets the best of you, makes you weak, makes you vulnerable...

612
01:08:40,803 --> 01:08:42,243
Johann.

613
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,530
Johann!

614
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:51,509
Come on, pal, hanging on there, will you?

615
01:08:51,783 --> 01:08:55,612
Johann? Johann!

616
01:09:40,653 --> 01:09:45,872
There we are. Your temper makes you sloppy, try to control it Agent Hellboy.

617
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,930
...before it controls you...

618
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:57,154
Glasshole!

619
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:19,466
#Can't smile without you#

620
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:28,445
Aha, hello Red.

621
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:33,441
-What are you listening to?
-Vivaldi, cimento dell'armonia.

622
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:37,127
-What's that?
-Just a remote.

623
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:42,472
This, yes...

624
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:45,767
Popular love songs?

625
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:54,947
Oh, Abe, you fell for the Princess?

626
01:10:55,457 --> 01:11:00,745
She's like me, a creature from another world.

627
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:07,343
-* get out more.
-She's alone in the world. I want to help her, I need to care for her.

628
01:11:09,513 --> 01:11:11,900
You're in love. Have a beer.

629
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:14,740
-No, my body's a temple.
-Now it's an amusement park.

630
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,145
-No, no, the gland...
-Just shut up and drink it, will you?

631
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:22,126
-What track?
-Eight.

632
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,640
"Can't smile without you"

633
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:27,962
-I know.
-Yeah, I'm gonna need a beer too.

634
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:32,398
See, I love the song. And I can't smile.

635
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,631
... or cry. I think I have no tear ducts.

636
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:44,667
I wish Father were here, he knows what to tell you... us

637
01:12:58,186 --> 01:13:02,360
-/Nuala/
-/You're here./

638
01:13:09,296 --> 01:13:11,216
Good dog.

639
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:45,032
It's the last one~!

640
01:13:47,275 --> 01:13:56,250
Look at it. She's it. She's my WHOLE life.

641
01:13:57,422 --> 01:14:05,355
You know? I will give my life for her.

642
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:09,049
But she also wants me to do the dishes.

643
01:14:10,508 --> 01:14:19,197
-I would do anything...
-She's mad at me. It's not because of the rooms duty, something else.

644
01:14:19,854 --> 01:14:25,929
-Well, ask her then.
-No~!

645
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:30,885
Listen Abe, when woman's mad about something but she's really mad about something else...

646
01:14:30,954 --> 01:14:34,842
You CAN'T ask. Cuz then she'll get angry because you have ask.

647
01:14:34,775 --> 01:14:38,312
You know what I mean? Never mind, don't ask that question.

648
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:41,895
-You gotta just...
-Yeah...

649
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:43,693
...find out.

650
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:56,676
Very quickly of you. The parchment was of no importance. The cylinder...

651
01:14:57,318 --> 01:14:59,318
...is very interesting.

652
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:05,881
We will find golden army... here.

653
01:15:06,351 --> 01:15:16,044
As for the crown piece, I know it's here. I can feel that much in you.

654
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,087
Father always tried so hard to shield your heart from mine.

655
01:15:23,596 --> 01:15:27,437
It's in one of the books, and I will find it.

656
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:32,081
Blue? You always look so beautiful in blue.

657
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:46,291
Blue! Poetry, love, found and lost. Other words. I will find it.

658
01:15:46,268 --> 01:15:53,579
-Listen, Red. I know what's going on with Liz, Red.
-Abe!

659
01:15:54,608 --> 01:16:00,341
-I'm sorry he has to know.
-Know what?

660
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,520
Why?

661
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:10,664
-Stay back!
-Abraham!

662
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,532
-No, don't, he'll kill you.
-Princess?

663
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:15,592
/Abraham? Is that what drives him to you?/

664
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:18,609
-No!
-I WILL kill you, Abraham.

665
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:24,112
And anyone else if that's necessary.

666
01:16:24,117 --> 01:16:32,741
Well, then why don't you just start with me? Your Royal-Ass-ness?

667
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:38,429
-And your weapon no choice?
-Five fingers matters.

668
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:43,349
You move, and I'll kill Abraham first.

669
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:54,989
-Red, you mustn't hurt the Prince.
-What?

670
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,527
If you hurt him, you hurt the Princess!

671
01:17:05,966 --> 01:17:10,090
-Will you give me the crown piece?
-No.

672
01:17:18,016 --> 01:17:19,736
The piece.

673
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:52,312
-Abe
-Red, I'm so sorry but there's a link...

674
01:17:52,345 --> 01:17:57,099
-Liz!
-Right behind you!

675
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:01,108
You may have mused in the past, am I mortal?

676
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:09,152
You are now.

677
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:22,059
Abraham, many people have died for this crown, he will too.

678
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:31,781
If you want to save him... and SEE her again. You will find the missing piece and bring it to me.

679
01:19:06,387 --> 01:19:08,706
Jesus, pull that damn thing out!

680
01:19:08,795 --> 01:19:15,292
I can not. Every time I touched it, every time I came close to it. It was close to his heart.

681
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:20,257
I don't know what else to do. The wound would not heal until the spear is removed.

682
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:25,571
-We're running out of time.
-Then we'll go ask for the Prince.

683
01:19:26,778 --> 01:19:29,298
We MAKE him to take it out.

684
01:19:30,573 --> 01:19:34,872
-Liz, you ask...?
-Shut up.

685
01:19:34,918 --> 01:19:39,203
No, no. let me tell you. I know what's important.

686
01:19:39,169 --> 01:19:46,476
It's you. I can turn my back on the world, all of it...

687
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:59,060
-As long as you stay with me.
-I'll stay with you. You're the best man I ever met.

688
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:02,069
Man...

689
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:46,549
*So the cylinder used coordinates to County Antrim in the Northern Ireland.

690
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:50,251
The Giant Causeway, right about... here.

691
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,448
Great, so we know where he is. What are we waiting for, we should get going.

692
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:59,906
-Prince demands the crown piece, Agent Sherman.
-So? We give it to him.

693
01:20:59,886 --> 01:21:04,645
-Dr. Manning.
-I'm afraid. It's not simple with that.

694
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,342
-Hold on here, what are you saying?
-The Golden army must not awaken.

695
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:13,240
So what? You're just gonna let him die, is that it?

696
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:16,730
I'm sorry, They called Washington, they have our orders.

697
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:21,698
-What about you? He saved your life.
-I know.

698
01:21:23,801 --> 01:21:27,545
-I know it's difficult for you, but...
-Well, I won't let him die.

699
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:31,213
Agent Sherman, may I remind you that I AM the leader of this team!

700
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:40,319
-Oh, there is no doubt about that, Sir. That's what you are, Dr Krauss. And if ever you were a human. That time is long gone.

701
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:46,904
-What's wrong with her? You want me to call her back, sir?
-Let her go, I understand.

702
01:21:47,759 --> 01:21:52,356
-What about you? You find anything?
-No, nothing yet.

703
01:21:52,455 --> 01:21:55,423
-Well, keep looking!
-Absolutely, sir.

704
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,050
All of you! Don't worry sir. We know it's here. We're gonna find it.

705
01:22:00,197 --> 01:22:03,901
Tell Manning get on the case. Things get done, they get done. They get done!

706
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:26,350
Even without the piece, we HAVE to get him out of here.

707
01:22:26,418 --> 01:22:30,682
We'll go to the Antrim, and we will find the prince.

708
01:22:31,108 --> 01:22:32,779
Abe!

709
01:22:36,054 --> 01:22:40,547
-Just two of us.
-Yes, yes.

710
01:22:40,766 --> 01:22:42,446
Let's go.

711
01:22:57,266 --> 01:23:01,386
We need to leave now, before they run clearance upstairs.

712
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:07,401
Good evening, my friends. Do you have authorization to take that plane?

713
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:09,579
You're not gonna stop us, Johann.

714
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:14,637
On the contrary, I've been giving it some thought, and it should be able to save Agent Hellboy.

715
01:23:14,664 --> 01:23:17,864
You say I'm not human any more.

716
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:21,698
But you're wrong, I can understand your pain all too well.

717
01:23:21,647 --> 01:23:28,045
A long time ago, I lost the woman I loved. And that was in fact the source of my present misfortune.

718
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:32,577
I'll tell you about it one day. But for now the tactical advantage is ours.

719
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:37,695
Consider this. The Prince lacks the crown piece, and without it his army poses no threat.

720
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:46,100
-So, we have clearance then?
-Agent Sherman... Liz, screw the clearance! We'll "TAKE" that plane!

721
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:14,034
It should be here some place. The entry should be... here.

722
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:18,433
-I don't understand.
-Perhaps there's some mistakes on the map.

723
01:24:22,868 --> 01:24:25,176
Hello there!

724
01:24:25,483 --> 01:24:29,509
I bet you welcome, strangers. How can I give you a assistance?

725
01:24:29,434 --> 01:24:31,914
We're seeking safe passage to Bethmora.

726
01:24:31,684 --> 01:24:35,157
What does a nice little girl like you want a night lungs.

727
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:38,023
-We are looking for Prince Nuada.
-I know.

728
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:40,451
-Trade me something. And I'll take you to him.

729
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:45,313
-Here I have a shiny belt.
-But I have no pants.

730
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:50,966
-Look, a wonderful set of magic eyes.
-I already have binoculars.

731
01:24:50,935 --> 01:24:57,060
But... I see something special, something shinning underneath that bandages. I want that!

732
01:24:57,096 --> 01:25:02,461
-No, you CAN'T take it out. Not without killing him.

733
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,845
Maybe I know someone who can! Will you trade me then?

734
01:25:11,515 --> 01:25:13,715
-All right.
-Very well.

735
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:26,912
Keep going. Keep going.

736
01:26:38,192 --> 01:26:40,312
Oh my God ..

737
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,213
You should see this city when it was alive.

738
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,840
-What happened to it?
-Curse.

739
01:26:58,865 --> 01:27:05,600
Soon as the golden army were stored here, plague, silence and death fell on us. World left us behind.

740
01:27:12,046 --> 01:27:15,872
For long time I alone dwell in the dust.

741
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:25,751
All right, little girl. The two of you come inside. The rest of you wait out here.

742
01:27:38,658 --> 01:27:45,547
Hello friend. I have brought you the visitors.

743
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:52,245
-I have a favor to ask you.
-I have no favor to you, goblin.

744
01:27:52,263 --> 01:27:55,317
-Fleece!
-But I have done so much for you.

745
01:27:55,362 --> 01:28:01,971
I have brought you many souvenirs. And he has something shinny, something mine.

746
01:28:08,298 --> 01:28:12,619
-Anung un Rama...
-You know that name?

747
01:28:12,497 --> 01:28:17,207
And yours, Elizabeth Sherman.

748
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:32,980
At last, I have been waiting for you both, many a window moon.*

749
01:28:32,969 --> 01:28:41,471
I... I am his death and I will meet him at each crossroad.

750
01:28:41,447 --> 01:28:44,304
Good. When can I get that which is mine?

751
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:56,040
-Can you save him?
-It is for you to decide that. It is all the same to me, my heart is filled with dust and sand.

752
01:28:56,087 --> 01:29:01,563
But you should know, it is his destiny...

753
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,720
...to bring about the destruction of the Earth

754
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:11,997
Not now, not tomorrow... but soon enough.

755
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:21,439
Knowing that, you still want him to live?

756
01:29:29,638 --> 01:29:37,812
So child make a choice, the world? Or him?

757
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:48,409
-Him.
-The time will come, and you my dear... will suffer more than anyone.

758
01:29:48,313 --> 01:29:53,311
I'll deal with that. Now save him.

759
01:29:53,443 --> 01:29:58,315
It is... it's done.

760
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:09,130
I have done what I can, now give him a reason to live.

761
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,900
Hey friend! What about that which is mine? Don't forget about me!

762
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:21,795
What about me? Friend?

763
01:30:32,268 --> 01:30:33,143
Shinny!

764
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:42,008
Listen to me, you big ape.

765
01:30:43,032 --> 01:30:45,129
You have to get up.

766
01:30:48,244 --> 01:30:50,244
You have to get up.

767
01:30:52,367 --> 01:30:54,647
Cuz you're gonna be a father.

768
01:31:11,595 --> 01:31:13,955
I'll become...

769
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,237
...father?

770
01:31:28,839 --> 01:31:33,218
Wow, all these are very touching. But, if you still wanna meet Nuada.

771
01:31:33,626 --> 01:31:36,226
We have to leave... now.

772
01:31:37,312 --> 01:31:38,552
Ready.

773
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,049
Here we are. and there... they are.

774
01:31:51,301 --> 01:31:54,398
70 times 70 soldiers.

775
01:31:54,431 --> 01:31:57,366
Sometimes I wish I never created it.

776
01:31:57,434 --> 01:32:00,868
They enbomb with horrories, whoosh with furnaces.

777
01:32:00,818 --> 01:32:03,877
One of those fires took the legs of me.

778
01:32:04,372 --> 01:32:09,207
This is the farthest I can go. I am not very good at steps.

779
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:14,651
But if you're here to stop him, the Prince, I wish you luck then.

780
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:18,664
-The golden army must not awaken. Undo what we did.
-We will.

781
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:40,919
You're here. So I assume you've brought me the remain piece.

782
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:44,750
-No, we didn't. But we should discuss...
-I wasn't addressing you... Tin man.

783
01:32:46,048 --> 01:32:47,835
-Abraham.
-Abraham?

784
01:32:48,067 --> 01:32:50,905
-My sister is well, as I promised.
-Abe!

785
01:32:51,117 --> 01:32:53,037
-So...
-/Don't Do it. Abraham./

786
01:32:53,739 --> 01:32:55,299
What the hell are you doing?!

787
01:32:56,353 --> 01:32:58,113
You'll do the exactly same for Liz.

788
01:32:58,158 --> 01:32:59,758
Agent Sapien... No!

789
01:33:20,912 --> 01:33:27,063
I am the prince Nuada, Silverlance, leader of the golden army.

790
01:33:28,056 --> 01:33:31,429
Is there anyone here who'll dispute my right?

791
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,255
Kill them!

792
01:34:50,642 --> 01:34:52,470
He lied to us!

793
01:34:54,335 --> 01:34:57,595
Abe buddy, we ever get out of this, we gotta talk.

794
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:26,347
Open wide!

795
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,624
Indestructible my ass!

796
01:36:16,456 --> 01:36:18,456
Throw me a body!

797
01:37:57,893 --> 01:37:59,621
Well, I'm out of ideas.

798
01:38:07,475 --> 01:38:08,403
I got one.

799
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,512
I challenge...

800
01:38:10,563 --> 01:38:17,930
...Prince Nuada... for the right to combat... this army.

801
01:38:29,108 --> 01:38:31,628
-You're not royalty.
-Yes.

802
01:38:23,586 --> 01:38:27,908
You challenge me? Who are you to challenge me? You're nobody!

803
01:38:31,966 --> 01:38:37,367
Yes! He's Anung un Rama, son of the fallen one! He has the right! Challenge must be answered.

804
01:38:41,003 --> 01:38:42,483
Very well, then.

805
01:38:42,916 --> 01:38:46,462
-Red!
-Think about it! He will kill you, Red.

806
01:38:46,468 --> 01:38:48,470
Don't worry babe.

807
01:38:49,398 --> 01:38:51,187
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.

808
01:38:52,658 --> 01:38:54,473
But I'm gonna kick his ass.

809
01:41:08,682 --> 01:41:10,442
Nice ride, huh?

810
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:52,433
You jumping slippery bastard! I gotcha now.

811
01:42:01,684 --> 01:42:05,981
Kill me you must, for I will not stop. I can not...

812
01:42:06,093 --> 01:42:09,435
Sorry, pal, I will.

813
01:42:09,638 --> 01:42:12,518
You live.

814
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:42,214
Nuala...

815
01:43:08,828 --> 01:43:10,748
The humans...

816
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,206
They will tired of you.

817
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:16,991
They will wage against you.

818
01:43:17,565 --> 01:43:20,205
Leave them...

819
01:43:20,553 --> 01:43:22,870
Is it them or us?

820
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:28,550
...which holocaust should be chosen?

821
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:42,711
I never had a chance to tell you how I felt.

822
01:43:43,869 --> 01:43:45,709
Give me your hand.

823
01:43:56,155 --> 01:43:58,275
It's beautiful.

824
01:43:58,517 --> 01:44:00,437
We die....

825
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:04,237
...and the world will be poorer for it.

826
01:44:17,909 --> 01:44:20,549
Nuala, my sister...

827
01:45:02,466 --> 01:45:05,226
-All that power...
-Don't even think about it!

828
01:45:52,405 --> 01:45:55,540
No... It's nothing, I told you it's an dead-end.

829
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:58,100
What are you doing? Go away!

830
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:00,227
Check up their belt locators.

831
01:46:01,643 --> 01:46:03,783
Check up their belt locators. Over there!

832
01:46:05,495 --> 01:46:07,695
Over there!

833
01:46:10,388 --> 01:46:11,468
You.

834
01:46:11,534 --> 01:46:14,616
You took that plane without authorization, young man.

835
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:17,457
Manning, here to help.

836
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,212
As always. What going on? What's going on?

837
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:22,693
I quit.

838
01:46:23,754 --> 01:46:26,114
-Are you serious?
-Looks that way, doesn't it?

839
01:46:26,456 --> 01:46:28,216
What's wrong with you. You can't all just quit!

840
01:46:29,235 --> 01:46:30,515
Watch us.

841
01:46:32,269 --> 01:46:34,200
On second thought...

842
01:46:35,229 --> 01:46:36,909
I think I'll keep this.

843
01:46:38,662 --> 01:46:40,979
Come on. Come on!

844
01:46:42,087 --> 01:46:44,607
Johann, they can't do this, stop them.

845
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:48,216
Dr Manning... Suck my ectoplasmic Schwanzstücke!

846
01:46:48,507 --> 01:46:51,987
So what have you said before, about us, going anywhere?

847
01:46:52,303 --> 01:46:56,370
Anywhere, you and me. Let's find a place in the country.

848
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,800
Clean air, green hills.

849
01:47:00,032 --> 01:47:04,628
A yard, with lots room to grow it. It'd be great for the baby!

850
01:47:04,692 --> 01:47:07,012
The babies...

851
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:21,120
#The End#
#Plz save the earth. Tree-hugger Badass RULES! ^o^#
