1214
01:10:17,863 --> 01:10:20,365
YOUR DR. SADOWSKI IS NOT
WHO HE SAYS HE IS.

1215
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:21,617
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1216
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,119
I FOUND OUT WHO HE WAS
BEFORE HE BECAME A DOCTOR.

1217
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,621
SEE, LOOK, HE USED TO BE
A MOUNTAINEERING GUY.

1218
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,124
AND ON HIS LAST TRIP,
HE TOOK A BUNCH OF PEOPLE UP TO MOUNT RAINIER,

1219
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:31,626
AND NONE OF THEM CAME BACK.

1220
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:32,878
EXCEPT FOR SADOWSKI.

1221
01:10:32,878 --> 01:10:37,249

THEY FELL TO THEIR DEATHS

OFF A 3,500-FOOT CLIFF.

1223
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,385

LIKE AN ACCIDENT--

1224

MAYBE, OK?

1225
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:44,139
BUT THE BEAUTY OF BEING
THE ONLY SURVIVOR

1226
01:10:44,757 --> 01:10:46,642
IS THAT YOU GET TO SAY
WHAT HAPPENED.

1227
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,144
I THINK
THIS IS A SICK GUY

1228
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,012
WHO NEEDS TO TAKE PEOPLE
UP TO HIGH PLACES

1229
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:54,149
AND WATCH THEM SUFFER
AND POSSIBLY DIE.

1230
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,017
THAT'S WHY HE NEEDS
DESPERATE PEOPLE.

1231
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,903
PEOPLE WHO WILL DO
WHATEVER HE SAYS.

1232
01:10:57,903 --> 01:11:00,405
BUT HE CURED ZAK
AND JOCELYN.

1233
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:02,274
THEN LOOK WHAT HE DID.

1234
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:04,159
OK, MAYBE HE THINKS
THAT HE CURED ZAK.

1235
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,410
MArYBE HE THINKS
HE'S HELPING JOCELYN.

DO YOU?

1386
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:58,980
I TOLD <i>YOU</i> TO SIT
ON THE RAILING.

1387
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:05,236
I RIGGED IT TO BREAK
FOR YOU, NOT RACHEL.

1388
01:22:15,246 --> 01:22:17,114
YOU KILLED RACHEL.

1389
01:22:17,115 --> 01:22:18,366
NO.

1390
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:19,617
<i>YOU</i> DID.

1391
01:22:19,618 --> 01:22:21,503
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DIDN'T
SIT ON THE RAILING

1392
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,754
LIKE I TOLD YOU TO!

1393
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:25,873
YOU WANTED ME TO FALL?

1394
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,010
WHY?

1395
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,261
AAH!

1396
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,381
WHEN I MET YOU,

1397
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:37,134
I DIDN'T HAVE 2 NICKELS
TO RUB TOGETHER.

1398
01:22:37,135 --> 01:22:40,888
YOU HAD YOUR PARENTS' MONEY
AND THAT BIG OLD HOUSE.

1399
01:22:42,774 --> 01:22:45,276
AND I COULD'VE HAD
ALL THAT.

1400
01:22:45,276 --> 01:22:47,144
EVEN RACHEL IF I WANTED.

1401
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:50,898
SHE WAS SO MUCH MORE
CONTROLLABLE.

1402
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:51,532
YOU...

1403
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,401
YOU'RE STUBBORN.

1404
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:56,537
YOU MAKE EVERYTHING
A MESS.

1405
01:22:56,538 --> 01:23:00,291
THAT'S WHY WHEN
THE DOCTOR CAME ALONG,

1406
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:04,044
I FIGURED, "HEY,
HOW MUCH MORE PERFECT COULD THIS BE?"

1407
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:07,164
A GUY WHO LIKES TO PUT
PEOPLE ON CLIFFS

1408
01:23:07,165 --> 01:23:09,667
AND SEE
IF THEY'LL JUMP?

1409
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:11,553
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1410
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:15,923
FROM THEN ON,

1411
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:19,677
I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS
ACTUALLY KIND OF FUN.

1412
01:23:19,678 --> 01:23:23,431
I KNEW YOU WERE TERRIFIED
OF COMING DOWN WITH YOUR MOTHER'S MENTAL ILLNESS,

1413
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,933
SO I JUST
HELPED YOU ALONG A LITTLE BIT

1414
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,819
BY DOSING YOU
FROM TIME TO TIME

1415
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,938
WITH THE WORST
HALLUCINOGENIC I COULD FIND.

1416
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:34,692
THEN ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
SIT BACK AND WATCH YOU FREAK OUT!

1417
01:23:37,195 --> 01:23:39,697
ADD A BIT OF SUGGESTION...

1418
01:23:39,698 --> 01:23:40,949
A LITTLE INCENSE HERE...

1419
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,451
MOVE THE SCARF THERE.

1420
01:23:44,703 --> 01:23:47,205
THE REST OF IT
WAS YOUR IMAGINATION.

1421
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,844
OH.

1422
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:55,963
THEN THERE WAS
THAT DAMN GROUP...

1423
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,849
AND ALL THEIR SUPPORT.

1424
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,356
THEY HAD TO GO.

1425
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:21,622
AAH! AAH!

1426
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,245
AAH!

1427
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:39,140
YOU SHOULD'VE PICKED
AN AMATEUR.

1428
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,008
AAH!

1429
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,401
CARLA!

1430
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,521
Dr. Sadowski: HANG ON!

1431
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,406
GIVE ME YOUR HAND!

1432
01:24:57,275 --> 01:24:58,526
GIVE ME YOUR HAND,
CARLA.

1433
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,280
THE ROOT WON'T HOLD!
IT'S GONNA BREAK!

1434
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,165
LET HIM GO!

1435
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:06,667
CARLA, GIVE ME YOUR HAND!

1436
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,290
GIVE ME YOUR HAND!

1437
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:31,692
MARK!

1438
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:34,195
MARK, PULL ME UP!

1439
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:36,063
MARK!

1440
01:25:59,838 --> 01:26:01,089
AAH!

1441
01:26:02,974 --> 01:26:07,979
AAH!

1442
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:16,737
AAH!

1443
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:29,867
TAKE MY HAND.

1444
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:34,872
COME ON, CARLA.
TAKE MY HAND.

1445
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:39,877
DO IT!

1446
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,531
AAH!

1447
01:27:04,903 --> 01:27:05,536
HANG ON!

1448
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:08,656
CLIMB THE ROPE, CARLA.

1449
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:09,907
CLIMB IT.

1450
01:27:09,908 --> 01:27:11,793
COME ON, CLIMB IT!

1451
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,295
CARLA, YOU CLIMB
THAT ROPE NOW!

1452
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:51,199
YOU'RE FINE.

1453
01:27:55,586 --> 01:27:57,454
YOU'RE FINE, CARLA.

1454
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:00,591
IT'S OK.

1455
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:55,012
BYE, RACHEL.

1456
01:29:15,033 --> 01:29:18,786
[RACHEL'S FLUTE]

1457
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,922
Rachel: CARLA...
