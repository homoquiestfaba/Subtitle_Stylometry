WOMAN: Even a man
who is pure at heart

00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,471
and says his prayers
by night may become

4
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,057
a wolf when the
wolf-bane blooms,

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,102
and the moon is full and bright.

 Tim?

00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,879
Tim, is that you?

 Tim?

15
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,599
Tim, help me lock these doors.

16
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,474
He's out there.

00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,443

00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,262
 Couldn't help it, could you?

20
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,263
 Nuh-uh.

21
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,099
[laughter]

22
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,208
 Bill Parker?

23
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,459
A little jungle rot.

24
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,794
Nothing serious.

25
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,087
- You Jake?
- Right.

26
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,004
Jake Sutter.

27
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,589
He with you?

28
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,591
[growl]

29
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,218
 If you say so.

30
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,761
 He's good at what he
does, and does it all.

31
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,679
 Hey, man.

32
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,596
None of my business.

33
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,098
I'm just a coordinator.

34
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,392
 This one must be a
beaut, because nobody's

35
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,977
talking back in Washington.

36
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,854
 I'll brief you
before we meet the doc.

37
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,813
 Stein, wasn't it?

38
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,731
 That's right.

39
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,773
Dr. Ivan Stein.

40
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,774
He requested you by name.

41
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,692
You must know him.

42
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,568
 Never heard of him.

43
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,782

00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,660
SONG: Friends say they see
you walking in the street.

45
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,036
You talk to--

46
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,585
 Nice cold beer sure
does hit the spot.

47
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,669
 That it does, Jake.

48
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,801
So who's you piss off
to get stuck out here?

49
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,428
 It's not so bad.

50
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,138
 You know, I've been doing
your country's dirty work--

51
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,598
 Our country's
dirty work, Bill.

52
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,891
 Right.

53
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,851
Our country's dirty
work for 10 years.

54
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,895
I hear I'm one of the best
special agents around--

55
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,897
 Yeah, I think you
started that tumor.

56
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,691
 Yeah, and I can't find
out what's going on.

57
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,859
 Excuse me.

58
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,818
 You said you're
going to brief us.

59
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,278
Brief us.

60
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,447
 I was told to bring
you in to meet Dr. Stein.

61
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,656
He seemed to know you.

62
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,908
You sure you haven't
heard of him?

63
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,201
 I wouldn't know
him if I fell on him.

64
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,160
What's his specialty.

65
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,036
 The human mind.

66
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,662
[laughter]

67
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,415
 A shrink?

68
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,167
 Behavior specialist.

69
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,044
He's here studying
the sun's radiation

70
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,587
effects on the humans.

71
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,463
 Out here?

72
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,215
 Especially out here.

73
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,926
 There's no humans here, Jake.

74
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,594
 Hate to be the bearer
of bad news, boys,

75
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,972
but we have a serious
ozone problem.

76
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,890
 No shit.

77
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,601
But why us?

78
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,853
 There's a lab outpost
in the jungle, a place

79
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,730
where they run tests and stuff.

80
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,565
About a week ago,
we lost contact.

81
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,359
 Terroristas?

82
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,653
 You tell me when you get back.

83
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,570
 Oh, I get it.

84
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,446
We go in there.

85
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,281
We deal with it.

86
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,950
You smuggle us out, right?

87
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,451
 Quick and quiet.

88
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,452
You were never here.

89
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,247
We never had a problem.

90
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,331
 Where's Stein come in?

91
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,750
 It's his operation.

92
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,460
 Why wasn't he there?

93
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,087
 Honeymoon.

94
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,296
His aid It was supposed to
pick him up at the airport,

95
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,381
but he never showed.

96
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,758
 Where's the drop zone?

97
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,885
 Drop zone?

98
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,053
That's good.

99
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:37,971
Yeah, you're new here.

100
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,138
This is the Amazon.

101
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,139
You don't fly in.

102
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,391
You don't fall in.

103
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,393
You walk in.

104
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,228
 Walk?

105
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,855
As in on foot?

106
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,231
 Only takes a day.

107
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,859
 Well, that's goddamn
inconvenient, Jake.

108
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,360
 You'll get used to it.

109
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,404
If not for my
rosary and my beer,

110
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,573
I probably couldn't
survive out here.

111
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,283
 Speaking of which--

112
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,534
 You've got it, Bill.

113
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,326
Rosary?

114
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,463
 Hello.

115
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,801
 Hi, honey.

116
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,553
Bring these boys a
couple of cold ones.

117
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,388
 Sure thing.

118
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,639
Good kid.

119
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,434
 Not bad.

120
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,810
 I'm glad you like her.

121
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,187
She'll be the one
who guides you in.

122
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,399
 Things are
brightening up already.

123
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,067
She got a sister?

124
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,944
[howls]

125
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,009
 Dr. Stein?

126
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,177
 Good morning, gentlemen.

127
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,345
Please, sit down.

128
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,971
 Well, my job's done.

129
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,139
- Bill--
- Jake.

130
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,057
 Good luck.

131
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,391
 Thanks.

132
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,019
I have a special goodbye
planned for Rosary.

133
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,187
- Uh-huh.
- Lee.

134
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,573
 You must be Mr. Parker.

135
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,491
 Do I know you, doctor?

136
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,117
 No.

137
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,953
 Because Jake was telling
me you requested me by name.

138
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,247
 You have quite a reputation
and come highly recommended.

139
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,415
I've been convinced
that you are one

140
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,000
of the best men for the job.

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,335
 Yeah, what job is that?

142
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,003
DR. STEIN: Escorting
my wife and me back

143
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,339
to our outpost in the
Amazon, and finding out what

144
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,591
happened to my scientific team.

145
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,301
 What makes you think
something happened to them?

146
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,303
 They haven't been heard
from in over a week.

147
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,597
And frankly there are
quite a few theories

148
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,848
as to what has happened.

149
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,266
 It's probably
a gorilla attack.

150
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,148
 There are many mysteries
in the Amazon, Mr. Parker.

151
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,943
People from all over the
world explore the region.

152
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,736
Some of them cite findings
of things that have

153
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,030
never been seen before by man--

154
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,199
insects, plants.

155
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,702
Some of them even
live to tell about it.

156
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,705
 Well, I don't think plants and
bugs are to blame for the loss

157
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,498
of contact with your team.

158
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,291
 And I don't think gorillas
are the answer either.

159
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,502
 Well, what do you think?

160
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,463
 My wife told me that
you are impatient.

161
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,299
 Among other things.

162
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,050
 Sheila?

163
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,848
 How are you, Bill?

164
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,600
 You two know each other.

165
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,979
 In a previous
life, I'm afraid.

166
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,441
I'm sorry, Bill,
but we need you.

167
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,151
 Oh, this is just great.

168
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,654
If the Lone Ranger was here,
the reunion would be complete.

169
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,823
 He's here.

170
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,116
 Cody's here?

171
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,454
 I had to ask him
in case you refused.

172
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,455
 Why would I refuse?

173
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,081
I didn't know it was you.

174
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,583
 I'm afraid it was my fault.

175
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,667
 Your fault?

176
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,127
What did you do?

177
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,464
Steal her from Cody after
she left me for him?

178
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,091
[violin]

179
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,386
- Shut up, Lee.
- Hey, man.

180
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,055
This is getting good, man.
BILL PARKER: Please?

181
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,222
 Well, that's no
way to make friends.

182
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,479
DR. STEIN: My
research team and I

183
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,064
have been doing a
great deal of study

184
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,733
on the effects of the
destruction of the ozone layer.

185
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,401
There are many
individuals and countries

186
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,986
that would do anything
to get their hands

187
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,529
on this information.

188
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,740
When I mentioned my
concerns to my wife,

189
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,200
she told me that you
were one of the best

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,785
men for the investigation.

191
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,536
And if you wouldn't
take the job,

192
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,163
then Cody was our other option.

193
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,081
 Where is he?

194
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,625
DR. STEIN: In the hall.

195
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,752
SHEILA STEIN: We had to
make a decision fast.

196
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:41,047
I thought you wouldn't show
if you knew I was involved.

197
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,132
 And Mr. Carlson
resides in the area.

198
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,260
SHEILA STEIN: Unlike you,
Cody's kept in touch.

199
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
 We need you.

200
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,430
We've got to find out
what happened at the lab

201
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,641
and hopefully find
our data intact.

202
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,185
And help any--
well, any survivors.

203
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,649
 So as far as the
government is concerned,

204
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,943
this little problem you're
having here doesn't even exist,

205
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,028
right?
- That sounds about right.

206
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,906
You're escorting a team
of medical experts.

207
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,367
 How's Cody fit in?

208
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,536
 I've heard Mr. Carlson
is an excellent shot.

209
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,453
 Yeah.

210
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,955
You're damn straight.

211
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,208
I just about found out
firsthand because of her.

212
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,626
 Understanding are ever.

213
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,383
No wonder she left you.

214
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,801
 Fuck you.

215
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,928
 That's no way to talk
to an old friend, Bill.

216
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,013
 You ain't heard nothing yet.

217
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,764
 You need my help.

218
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,768
 Oh yeah?

219
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,854
 You could be up
against 30 guns or more.

220
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,398
BILL PARKER: I'm not
impressed by numbers.

221
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,149
 I am.

222
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,321
CODY: I might have
been a lousy friend,

223
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,784
but I was always an
excellent partner, right?

224
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,580
The Lone Ranger and
Tonto, remember?

225
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,372
 Yeah.

226
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,924
I remember kemosabe
running off with my girl.

227
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,342
 That was personal.

228
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,886
This is business.

229
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,305
Now when do you want to leave?

230
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,222
 Ah, hell.

231
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,223
We leave in the morning.

232
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,171
 Does that thing
help you figure out

233
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,840
the effects of the black ozone?

234
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,259
 Well as you know,
the ozone is a layer

235
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,512
of gas that protects us from
the harmful rays of the sun.

236
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,473
I'm funded to find a link
with this ozone problem

237
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,309
to a deadly skin
disease known as lupus

238
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,436
erythematosus chronic discord.

239
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,064
It's a disease of
unknown origin that's

240
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,608
brought on by excessive
exposure to the sun.

241
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,652
 You means skin cancer?

242
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,989
 Something like that,
although more complicated.

243
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,699
Tests show that
next to Antarctica,

244
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,495
this is the location of the
largest of the ozone holes.

245
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,705
The weather readings
indicate that within a year,

246
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,833
the Amazon jungle will become
a desert, uninhabitable

247
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,585
during the daylight hours.

248
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,587
 Sounds like you're describing
the end of the world, doctor.

249
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,674
 That's precisely
what I'm describing.

250
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,008
My colleagues and
I have compiled

251
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,052
several hundred pages
of extensive data

252
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,303
backing up our theory.

253
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,763
We need that data.

254
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,598
It's too late to start over.

255
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,975
 Why?

256
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,394
 Yesterday was 118 degrees.

257
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,937
Water boils at 212.

258
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,772
Every day it gets worse.

259
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,361
[music playing]

260
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,823
SONG: Don't look at the sky.

261
00:17:53,823 --> 00:18:01,289
It'll only set your mind
in motion, at a speed

262
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,624
far greater than an ocean.

263
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,089
You question.

264
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,553
You question.

265
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,231
Through a looking glass I--

266
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:36,824
I notice you, almost as if
you seeped into the cold,

267
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,786
pouring rain.

268
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:49,754
No one is to blame
for the dilemma.

269
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,256
For the dilemma.

270
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,632
For the dilemma.

271
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,224
Don't look at the sky.

272
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:10,691
It'll only set your mind
in motion, at a speed

273
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,528
far greater than an ocean.

274
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,033
You question.

275
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,997
You question.

276
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,502
Don't you question?

277
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,968
Don't you question?

278
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:45,935
Bye.

279
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,897
Bye.

280
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,403
Bye.

281
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,368
Bye.

282
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,331
Bye.

283
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:12,837
Bye.

284
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:30,396
 Everything all right, doctor?

285
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,272
Dr. Stein?

286
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,238
 It's a lot than where we left.

287
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:51,292
Sorry about the way
I got you involved.

288
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,003
 I got to admit, I
was a little surprised.

289
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,758
I thought I'd never
see you again.

290
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,889
 That's why I
couldn't tell you.

291
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:09,059
I really wanted you to come.

292
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,397
Not just for the
project, either.

293
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,568
I wanted to see you again.

294
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,486
 Better watch it.

295
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,279
You're a married woman.

296
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,573
Don't want to upset Ivan.

297
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,371
Why Cody?

298
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,333
 You really don't want to
get into that, now do you?

299
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,542
 I'm tough.
I can take it.

300
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,293
Why him?

301
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,840
 Convenience.

302
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,175
 Convenience?

303
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,262
 I don't know.

304
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,224
He was just there.

305
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:55,147
He never pressured me or
talked about settling down.

306
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,732
 He wanted me to
have my career, too.

307
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,782
It was a choice I had to make.

308
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,659
 You made the wrong one.

309
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,746
SHEILA STEIN: Yeah?

310
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,706
Well, maybe I did.

311
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,583
That won't change things now.

312
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,508
 You saying you didn't love me?

313
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,469
 That's not the point.

314
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,263
It's my career I
want, and I won't give

315
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,934
that up for anything--
not money or security or--

316
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,310
or even love.

317
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,780
But that's all behind us.

318
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,825
 So how long did it last?

319
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,786
 Three months.

320
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,788
You know our Cody.

321
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,747
Hi ho, Silver.

322
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,540
Away.

323
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:02,673
 So now you just
married into your career?

324
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,594
 Ivan's different
from both of you.

325
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,345
 I wanted to marry you.

326
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,724
 I know.

327
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,147
That's why I left.

328
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,107
Don't you see?

329
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,776
If I'd stayed, you
could convince me

330
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,864
of anything-- even to settle
down and raise a family.

331
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,244
I just couldn't.

332
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:44,548
I had to cut it off before your
dreams became my realities.

333
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,888
 So here we are--

334
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,765
you, me, Cody, and Ivan.

335
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,771
God hates me.

336
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,088
 It's hot.

337
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,131
 Yeah, but you know,
this is no humidity.

338
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,342
 No, but I noticed
little animals

339
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,510
exploding all around us.

340
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,427
You ready?

341
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,345
 Funny.

342
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,429
Yeah, I'm ready.

343
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,389
Ha!

344
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,139
 Ha!

345
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,132
[clattering]

346
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,065
 It's clear.

347
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,492
What a stink.

348
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,387
 It's through here.

349
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,268
 This place is too well
hidden to have been hit.

350
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,313
 Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

351
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:08,233
 Is that all
that's on your mind?

352
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,735
 You know, now
that you mention it,

353
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,362
Cody, there's a few things
I'd like to clear up.

354
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,447
 Like?

355
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,782
 Like I thought
we were friends.

356
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,283
What are you doing
going out with Sheila?

357
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,534
 I'd like to think
we still are friends.

358
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,960
 How long have you two--

359
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,545
 We weren't.

360
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,465
Just came as a big a surprise
to me as it did to you.

361
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,425
Just something that happened.

362
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,930
Just seemed like a good idea.

363
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,890
 Let's drop it.

364
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,266
Yeah, sure.

365
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,392
Besides, we're both
out of the picture now.

366
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,292
 Whoa.

367
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,087
Lee, I want that ventilation
system going ASAP.

368
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:10,879
 No problem.

369
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,342
 Man.

370
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,594
What the fuck died in here?

371
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,554
Cody, come with me.

372
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,111
 Hey, shouldn't we
wait for Bill or Cody?

373
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,612
 They're looking for intruders.

374
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,322
This is my office,
and I'd like to make

375
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,577
sure our data's still intact.

376
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:45,080
Don't suppose either
of you has a nail file?

377
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,041
 How about this?

378
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,418
 That should do the trick.

379
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,407
 Radio room.

380
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,913
 I was just stepping
real close, man.

381
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,792
BILL PARKER: Whoever
did this meant business.

382
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,882
 Damn.

383
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,050
- No sound effect, huh?
- Yeah.

384
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,426
"Taps."

385
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,719
 I want you to find
that power right now.

386
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,012
I don't want to leave
the others alone.

387
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,347
[beeping]

388
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,015
 I got it.
Come on, man.

389
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,614
 We'll get Bill
and Cody and have

390
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:01,865
them secure the room first.

391
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,325
 What are you afraid of?

392
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:07,079
They're within
shouting distance.

393
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,915
If my mother were
alive, she'd tell you

394
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,750
that if I didn't
become a doctor,

395
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,545
I would have been a cat burglar.

396
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,089
See?

397
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,215
Your heroes aren't the only
ones capable of breaking

398
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,300
and entering.

399
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,176
Follow me.

400
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,107
[beeping]

401
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,154
 I can fix this.

402
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,322
 Good.

403
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,865
Cody, let's get
this place secure.

404
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,494
 I always hated
working in the dark.

405
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,955
 Well, it doesn't
scare me, kiddies.

406
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,581
[laughter]

407
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,751
 Go easy on him, Lee.

408
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,378
 Don't go away mad.

409
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,262
 Here, I got them.

410
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,888
 Oh, Dr. Stein?

411
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,349
 What is it?

412
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,309
[screams]

413
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,269
 Sheila.

414
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,145
Let's go, quick.

415
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,907
 Looks like he locked himself
in and committed suicide.

416
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,159
 Yeah, well, look--

417
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,952
there's a hammer and nails.

418
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,080
Some wood.

419
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,831
 Ah.

420
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:42,174
 Ah, Sheila, when was the last
time you performed an autopsy?

421
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,425
 Why?

422
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,428
 These ulcerations
on the face--

423
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:50,265
 It was obviously
a suicide, Ivan.

424
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,727
 I'm aware of that, but why
is what I'd like to find out.

425
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,070
 You all right?

426
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,821
 See?

427
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,283
Didn't I tell you your heroes
were within shouting distance?

428
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,743
 Who's he?

429
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,911
 His name is--

430
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,164
was-- Dr. Springer.

431
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,791
 Cody, give me a hand.

432
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's cut him down.

433
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,092
 I don't suppose you
found any survivors?

434
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,052
 Who the hell did
you have working here?

435
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,762
Jack the Ripper?

436
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,722
 What do you mean?

437
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,183
 Well, I mean, you had eight
people manning this laboratory

438
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,519
and besides this poor son
of a bitch, all we've got

439
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,937
is a radio room full of blood.

440
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,480
Where the hell is everybody?

441
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,565
 Well, it sure doesn't look
like a terrorist attack.

442
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,192
 No, it doesn't.

443
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,279
 The smell around here, I'd
say he's been dead a week.

444
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,615
 When did you say
your last contact?

445
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,491
 Oh, let's see.

446
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,868
About nine days ago now.

447
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,912
 I'd like an autopsy
on this man, Mr. Parker,

448
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,705
if that's all right with you.

449
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,083
 I'll tell you what, doc--
this medical bullshit,

450
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,709
that's your problem.

451
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,002
I'm just here to keep you
safe and get you back alive.

452
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,714
 Everybody all right?

453
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,715
 Yeah.

454
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,967
Hey, good job on the lights.

455
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,593
How about some AC?

456
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,469
 Well, don't beat me.

457
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,513
I work cheap.

458
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,515
 Lee, get the AC working.

459
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,901
[air conditioner starts]
- You feel that?

460
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,528
You feel that?

461
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,779
Good old American know-how.

462
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,697
Who da man?

463
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,447
 I'll check the files.

464
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,923
 Who's he?

465
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,759
 Dr. Springer.

466
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,221
 He needs a
serious-ass make-over.

467
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,098
 Yeah.

468
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,600
 Let's put him on the table.

469
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,392
 Lee.

470
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,239
 Have to beat the bongo.

471
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,659
 If my memory is correct,
the doctor seems to have

472
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,119
all the symptoms of lupus.

473
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,829
 Are you sure?

474
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,583
 Now he's badly decomposed,
but look at the ulcerations here

475
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,501
and here.

476
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,420
I know I've seen this before.

477
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,297
 We'll have to take these
tissue samples to the lab

478
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,299
to really know for sure.

479
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,426
 Is this shit contagious?

480
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,844
 No, Lee.

481
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,513
This shit is caused by
overexposure to the sun.

482
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,724
This place seems secure enough.

483
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,727
If worst came to worst, we
could make a last stand here.

484
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,145
 I'm afraid that's
what Dr. Springer

485
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,231
thought as well, Mr. Carlson.

486
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,900
 Lee, is our generator OK?

487
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,610
 Actually, this place
runs on solar power,

488
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,445
and some of the main
services have been trashed.

489
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,030
- Trashed?
- Yes, ma'am.

490
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,365
Torn to shreds.

491
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,533
But we got a gas gennie
in the back and 10

492
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,451
gallons of Esso's finest.

493
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,786
So we're all right.

494
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,120
 Well, that ought to
go in an emergency.

495
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,163
 Whoa, whoa.

496
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,164
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

497
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,582
You expecting an emergency?

498
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,668
 Hey, I'm just making
this up as I go along.

499
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:05,877
I don't want to
use any more energy

500
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,254
than is absolutely necessary.

501
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,131
So let's secure the
lights we're not using.

502
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,926
We'll look for survivors
after we've had some rest.

503
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,428
 We hadn't planned on resting.

504
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:20,141
 Bill, I think we'd really like
to get to work on this autopsy.

505
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,186
 Lee, Rosary, let's go
and secure a perimeter.

506
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,104
 All right.

507
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:24,854
See you, doc.

508
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,101
 What are you so jumpy about?

509
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,688
 Look at that blood.

510
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,273
Until we can figure
out what happened here,

511
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,774
we're going to break in shifts.

512
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,276
This seems to be the only
sector within lights,

513
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,861
so I think we'll call this home.

514
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,529
 Sounds good to me.

515
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,239
 Cody, you and Rosary see if
you can find some blankets.

516
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,992
Lee's got the AC working so good
I'm going to freeze to death.

517
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,285
 Bitch, bitch, bitch.

518
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,202
 You gonna take the
first watch, Bill?

519
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,955
 Yeah, I am.

520
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,957
 Listen, we'll
each pull two hours.

521
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,876
We'll get some rest that
way, and then in the morning,

522
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,755
we can start looking
for survivors.

523
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,465
 This is scary shit, man.

524
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,800
 I hate this place, man.

525
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,636
I had this fucking place.

526
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,397
[squeaking]

527
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,446
 Shit.

528
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,615
 Lee will have to take
care of it in the morning.

529
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,866
 What a mess.

530
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:04,537
Cody, shine the
light over there.

531
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,456
CODY: I don't like it.

532
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:10,001
 Who could have done this?

533
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,254
CODY: Damned if I know.

534
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,631
Just grab a few blankets.

535
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:15,799
We're not going to find
any survivors here.

536
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,979
 Ready when you are.

537
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,150
 My, you look beautiful
when you're scrubbed.

538
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,112
 Everything all right?

539
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,488
 As well as can be expected.

540
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,490
 I brought you a present.

541
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,909
 How thoughtful.

542
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,120
 Well, it's the only
color I could find.

543
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,788
 And sheets too.

544
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,664
Why, William.

545
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,040
You shouldn't have.

546
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,667
 Well, I didn't
think you'd want

547
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,086
to make too much of a mess,
so maybe those will help.

548
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,506
 Parker, if you don't mind,
we've got a lot of work to do.

549
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,257
 Sorry.

550
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,012
 Thanks, Bill.

551
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,723
 Sure.

552
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,309
 Crazy fool still loves you.

553
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,978
 Well, he can't be that crazy.

554
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,397
You love me, too.

555
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,983
 I suppose Cody
still has feelings--

556
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,277
 Quite possible.

557
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,654
Right now, we've got work to do.

558
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,131
[squeaking]

559
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,259
 Who's there?

560
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,510
Lee, is that you.

561
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,014
Damn it.

562
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,176
[breathing]

563
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,415
[breathing]

564
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,974
LEE: Hold it.

565
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,977
Who goes there?

566
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,063
I am the master of these halls.

567
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,981
You may not pass.

568
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,899
 Shh.

569
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,192
I heard something.

570
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,153
 What?

571
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:51,574
So did I. Your licking hair.

572
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,034
 Go ahead.

573
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,535
 And you keep cool.

574
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,870
We just met.

575
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,498
BILL PARKER: Rosary,
Lee, where are you?

576
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:02,502
 Oh, we better answer him.

577
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,046
 Whatever was down here,
it ain't down here no more.

578
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:05,838
We're down here.

579
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,094
 I'm going to go look around.

580
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,470
There might be some
scared survivors.

581
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,429
 All right, all right.

582
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,139
Look, be careful.

583
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,724
I hate this place.

584
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,600
 I know.

585
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,976
I'll be all right.

586
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:26,859
Here goes nothing.

587
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,258
 Captain.

588
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,050
 What's going on?

589
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,191
[screams]

590
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,776
 Get Cody.

591
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:50,985
- No, I'm going with you, man.
- No, you're not, man.

592
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,236
Get Cody quick.

593
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:52,987
 Check.

594
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:10,880
 You all right?

595
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,635
Now we've found two.

596
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:16,594
 What did this?

597
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,892
 It wasn't lupus.

598
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,936
Lee, I want the whole place lit.

599
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:25,895
Forget saving power.

600
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,230
LEE: Yes, sir.

601
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,231
- The whole place, lit now.
- All right.

602
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,106
All right.
- Go.

603
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,818
LEE: Come on, come on.

604
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,737
 Give me the flashlight, Bill.

605
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,155
 Forget it, Cody.

606
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,615
Nobody's going in any
sector that isn't lit.

607
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,999
[howling]

608
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,880
 So how do you know
a beast killed him?

609
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,423
BILL PARKER:
Something killed him.

610
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,133
And it wasn't
terrorists or gorillas

611
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,261
or some goddamned sickness.

612
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,179
 What do you think did it?

613
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,764
 I don't know, but
you can bet your ass

614
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,474
everybody in this place
didn't commit suicide.

615
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,187
DR. STEIN: Can you bring
the body back up here?

616
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,399
There's no reason
to get hysterical.

617
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,025
There's got to be a
logical explanation.

618
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,944
We've just not yet found it.

619
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,405
 As soon as Lee gets this place
lit, we're going to find it.

620
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:31,252
 Red, red, yellow,
yellow, brown, brown.

621
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,169
Boop.

622
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,588
Computer.

623
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,131
Betas.

624
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,132
Beep.

625
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,717
Warp core breach contained.

626
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,051
Ah, cool.

627
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,636
Let's just see.

628
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,138
Prepare for power.

629
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,139
Stand by.

630
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,142
Engage.

631
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,227
[breathing]

632
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,103
 Ha!

633
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,605
Damn, I'm good.

634
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,607
I do all this good.

635
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,983
I got this shit going on.

636
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,370
 I'm going to shoot you
if I can get that gun.

637
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,372
All right, hand-to-hand then.

638
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,124
Come on, you Chewbacca
motherfucker.

639
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,959
Come on.

640
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,295
 What's that?

641
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,631
 Christ, that's Lee.

642
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,673
Lock this door.

643
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,883
Don't open it till we get back.

644
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,512
 No, thank you.

645
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,680
I'll leave the killing
to the lover-boys.

646
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,103
 I'll take it.

647
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,898
Hey, look-- I lived with Bill
and Cody, and believe me,

648
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,067
I can use this thing
better than both of them.

649
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,204
 You don't want to see him.

650
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,664
It's--

651
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:50,539
 Oh, man.

652
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,545
You bastard!

653
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,505
Come out!

654
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,966
Where the fuck are you?

655
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,300
 Save your strength.

656
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,264
What are we up against, man?

657
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,641
 Wish I knew.

658
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,565
 You still think we're
getting hysterical?

659
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,151
 I think we could stand to
be a little more rational.

660
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,486
 Rational?

661
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,322
This thing just tore
my partner to bits.

662
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,325
This same thing wiped out
your entire medical team.

663
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,536
Now excuse me, doctor,
if I seem like I'm

664
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,829
a little overly concerned.

665
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,039
 The autopsy turn up anything?

666
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,918
 The body does indeed show
symptoms of advanced lupus,

667
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,128
mask of the wolf.

668
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,713
 What the fuck is that?

669
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,590
 Apparently Dr. Springer
spent too much time in the sun.

670
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,843
 People don't kill themselves
over a fucking sun burn.

671
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,887
DR. STEIN: Not unless
they fear dying anyway.

672
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,848
 With that thing out
there, I'm surprised

673
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,474
he wasn't scared of it.

674
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,727
 I meant a slow death, where
his flesh would be slowly

675
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,979
eaten away by the sun's rays.

676
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,983
 That would be enough to force
anyone to take his own life.

677
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,319
 The final step of sanity
is to become insane.

678
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,280
 Look, we've
gotten the documents

679
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,240
we need for the ozone project.

680
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,867
I say we get the
hell out of here.

681
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,201
 In the jungle at night?

682
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,202
Are you nuts?

683
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,704
 Look, I need a few hours.

684
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,080
 A few hours?

685
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,415
We won't last a few
minutes if that thing

686
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,916
decides he wants inside.

687
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,918
 I need time, till sunrise.

688
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,379
By then, we'll know what
happened to our colleagues.

689
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,631
 I can tell you what happened.

690
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,133
They were ripped to shreds.

691
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,969
 Mr. Parker, I need you
to control your emotions.

692
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,804
Your orders were to
protect us and find

693
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,181
out what happened here.

694
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:35,061
And that's precisely
what I'm going to do.

695
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,729
 What do you suggest, doctor?

696
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:40,483
 First, I think we should
bring Lee's body back up here.

697
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:43,778
I think another
autopsy is in order.

698
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,197
 I don't want you dissecting
Lee like some animals.

699
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,740
 Mr. Parker, please.

700
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,283
If I'm going to find
out some answers,

701
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,786
I'm going to have
to do this my way.

702
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,412
By examining his
wounds, we'll be

703
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,247
able to find out what
type of instrument

704
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,582
was used to kill him.

705
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,671
 Rosary, I'm going to
need your help with Lee.

706
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,675
 Sure thing.

707
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,804
 If you wish, you can
dispose of Dr. Springer.

708
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,388
 You mean bury the man.

709
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,225
DR. STEIN: Whatever.

710
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,601
 Cody--

711
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,477
 Got it.

712
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,181
 He was right here.

713
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,517
 Are you sure he was dead?

714
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,935
 Yeah.

715
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,686
Yeah, he was torn to bits.

716
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,399
 Bill, look at this.

717
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,645
 Leads right through that door.

718
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,440
 Maybe we should seal it in.

719
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,609
 Thought you knew
how to use that thing.

720
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,278
- I do.
- So what are you worried about?

721
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,989
 Finding something
to use it on.

722
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,990
 Me too.

723
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,908
Come on.

724
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:54,658
Let's go.

725
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,093
 I'm telling you,
we get a hammer

726
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,763
and we board it up inside.

727
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,389
 I'd like to know
what we're up against.

728
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,265
 Funny.

729
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,100
I'm not that curious.

730
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,728
 You ready?

731
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,687
 I'm ready.

732
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,605
[screams]

733
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,941
[gunshot]

734
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,359
 You OK?

735
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,276
 Bill--

736
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,611
 Cody!

737
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:31,570
Cody, come up here
and secure this door.

738
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,613
Come on.

739
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,697
We've got to get you to Sheila.

740
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,615
Come on.

741
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,491
Come on, quick.

742
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:39,161
Cody, get up here.

743
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,455
 Bill, describe what you saw.

744
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,208
 I'm not sure.

745
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,753
It looked like a man, but he
acted like a wild animals.

746
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,589
I can only tell you what I saw.

747
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,592
 What you saw, or
what you think you saw?

748
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,094
 I'm not crazy.

749
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,304
Rosary saw it too.

750
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,599
 Bill, no one's
calling you crazy.

751
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,226
 Everyone OK?

752
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,311
 Yeah, aside of me being
nuts, we're doing fine.

753
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,646
Did you manage to get that--

754
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,064
 Don't worry, Bill.

755
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,774
If he were Houdini, he
couldn't get out there.

756
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,150
Rosary's babysitting.

757
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,487
 Good work, Cody.

758
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,365
 Do we have any wild
guesses what this is?

759
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:19,743
 Well, it's either a
figment of my imagination

760
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,120
or some kind of wolf-man.

761
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,871
 What, a werewolf?

762
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,999
 Not quite, but close.

763
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,375
CODY: I thought
werewolves were something

764
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,253
created for the movies.

765
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,714
 There are many werewolf
legends and stories

766
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,674
found in all parts
of the world, some

767
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,093
with more validity than others.

768
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:41,098
But as far as I know, there's
no such thing as a werewolf.

769
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,642
 Did you see fangs or hair?

770
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,981
 I'm not sure.

771
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,692
 Perhaps Bill's right.

772
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,070
 What are you thinking, Ivan.

773
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,156
 Perhaps what you
saw is a lycanthrope.

774
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,241
 A what?

775
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,617
 Why does that sound familiar?

776
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,624
 "Lycanthrope--
formerly a man believed

777
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,544
to be transformed into a wolf.

778
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,212
A werewolf."

779
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,630
BILL PARKER: I thought you
said there was no such thing.

780
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,758
 Let her continue.

781
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,886
 "Now known as the person
affected with lycanthropy."

782
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,637
BILL PARKER: What?

783
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,098
SHEILA STEIN: It says it's an
insanity in which the patient

784
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,560
supposes himself to be a wolf.

785
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,645
 I've heard about
this back in Germany.

786
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,023
It is indeed
something to behold--

787
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,650
a plain and simple
type of schizophrenia

788
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,611
in which one of the
multiple personalities

789
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:40,949
is that of an animal,
or in this case, a wolf.

790
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,744
SHEILA STEIN: Combine this with
the effects of being exposed

791
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,455
to the sun without
ozone protection,

792
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,790
and we've got one serious--

793
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,541
CODY: One sick fucker.

794
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,877
 Not quite the medical term
I'd give it, Mr. Carlson,

795
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,504
but for now, it will do.

796
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,676
BILL PARKER: Look,
Ivan, this guy

797
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,471
was strong enough that he
tore Lee apart and dragged

798
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,223
him up a flight of stairs.

799
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,058
 What you saw was
a man who thought

800
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,394
himself a wolf, a lycanthrope.

801
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,687
 Look, I saw this
guy's face up close.

802
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,231
He growled at us.
He snapped at us.

803
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,148
He was like a--

804
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,650
 A monster?

805
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,069
The human mind is indeed
something to behold.

806
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,573
- Here we are.
- What?

807
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,491
What you got?

808
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,617
 Kevin Johnson.

809
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,328
He's our man, Bill.
Read this.

810
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,579
You're not going to like it.

811
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:31,834
 Six foot five, 275 pounds.

812
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,837
What kind of scientists have
you got working for you?

813
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,923
 This guy was ugly
before he became a wolf.

814
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,133
 He's not a wolf.

815
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,676
He's still a man.

816
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,719
He just thinks he's a wolf.
- Oh, that's terrific.

817
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,972
We've got Mr. Universe
trapped upstairs

818
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,390
and he thinks he's Lon Chaney.

819
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,599
Now what?

820
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,143
 We must bring
him back for study.

821
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,061
 Ivan, he's a human being.

822
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,771
He should be taken
back for treatment.

823
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,148
 Yeah, but he's killed.

824
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,858
 All the more reason.

825
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,569
What we are witnessing here is
a kind of reverse evolution.

826
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,653
We have tranquillizers.

827
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,280
We can sedate him.

828
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,865
 I can't believe you'd
make a scientist out

829
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,783
of a guy that size.

830
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,869
 According to
his personal file,

831
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,413
he's been with the
program for two years.

832
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,290
Played some college football.

833
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,919
Even competed in the Olympic
trials as a weight-lifter.

834
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,921
 He was one ugly bastard.

835
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,382
 That was the
overexposure to the sun.

836
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,509
We have no idea of
the transformation

837
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,095
he's undergoing internally,
as well as externally.

838
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,598
 Why is it I don't
feel sorry for him?

839
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,766
- A natural fear of the unknown.
- Ah, fear.

840
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,143
Hell.

841
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,811
Your friend's already
killed nine people.

842
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,313
I'm for doing him in.

843
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,522
 That's out of the question.

844
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,877
 He quiet OK.

845
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:00,547
 Lets out with a howl
from time to time.

846
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,465
How's that arm?

847
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,383
 Oh, itching like crazy.

848
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,843
What are you doing?

849
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:05,928
 Taking precautions.

850
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:10,724
 Silver?

851
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,351
 The Lone Ranger, remember?

852
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,270
Besides, they're supposed
to bring you luck.

853
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,897
 You afraid of werewolves?

854
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,398
 Nah.

855
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,274
[howling]

856
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,443
But I'm damned close.

857
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,947
 So am I. Where'd
you find them?

858
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,533
 An old guy at a village
not too far from the base

859
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:28,492
made them for me.

860
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,660
Cost me a buck a bullet.

861
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,037
 Ah, can you get two for me?

862
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:32,996
 Sure.

863
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,206
It'll cost you $5 a piece.

864
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,541
 $5?

865
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,626
I thought you said
it cost you one buck.

866
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,127
 Supply and demand.

867
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,047
If you want, I can show
you where the village is.

868
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,006
 Ha, ha, ha.

869
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,882
Very funny.

870
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,884
 Suit yourself.

871
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,262
[banging]

872
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,557
 Maybe I'll take one.

873
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,475
I'll pay you when we get back.

874
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,810
 One?

875
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,645
 One is all I'm going to need.

876
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,696
 You all right?

877
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,573
 I don't feel too good.

878
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,746
 How's she doing?

879
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,747
SHEILA STEIN: Shock.

880
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,874
High blood, highly unusual.

881
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,046
 Take care of her.

882
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,214
SHEILA STEIN: Will do.

883
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,511
 How can you
think such a thing?

884
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,347
Not only as my wife,
but as a scientist.

885
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,100
 I was merely suggesting that
perhaps it would be in the best

886
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,437
interest of the expedition if
we left Kevin behind for now

887
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,440
and came back for him at a later
date with the proper equipment.

888
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,733
 Absolutely not.

889
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,651
He'd starve to death
trapped like that,

890
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,653
then we'd never be
able to study him.

891
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,031
We have no idea how much
of his human emotions

892
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,240
are still intact.

893
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,491
 But you're
forgetting why we were

894
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,451
sent here in the first place.

895
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,577
 We have him contained.

896
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,038
 You don't know that for sure.

897
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,123
I mean, what if he becomes
immune to heat and just

898
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,416
walks right out of here.

899
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,751
We don't have the
man power, Ivan.

900
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,918
Tranquilize him.

901
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,255
 Yeah, right.

902
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,716
Ivan, he's killed nine people.

903
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:11,678
He will surely try to kill us.

904
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,013
 Kevin's no longer human.

905
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,222
He thinks he's a wolf.

906
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,599
A werewolf.

907
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,059
 A werewolf?

908
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,685
 I prefer the term lycanthrope.

909
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,230
 I was bitten by a werewolf.

910
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,315
 It's all right.

911
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,775
It's going to be just fine.

912
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,984
 But it bit me.

913
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,319
Do you know what that means?

914
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,236
 It's sheila.

915
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,614
I'm here.

916
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,782
Everything's going to be fine.

917
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:32,908
I promise.

918
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,117
 He bit me.

919
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,578
 It's just an old wives tale.

920
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,247
Surely you don't really
believe that, now do you?

921
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,165
It's all right.

922
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,667
Just calm down.

923
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,126
Look, I've cleansed the
wound, so there shouldn't

924
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,296
be any infection, all right?

925
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,548
I think it might be wise if
we gave her a little something

926
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,466
to sedate her.

927
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,926
 Perhaps you're right.

928
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,053
 It was a werewolf, wasn't it?

929
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,221
 Don't be absurd.

930
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,639
There's really no
such thing as--

931
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,515
 Yes, you're right.

932
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,392
It's a werewolf.

933
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,519
 And it bit me.

934
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,938
And I'm going to turn
into something like that?

935
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,314
Help me, please.

936
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,149
 Don't worry,
it'll be all right.

937
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,484
 Ivan, what are you saying?

938
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,569
 It's no use hiding
it from her, Sheila.

939
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,279
We've got to tell
her the truth, then

940
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,323
we can kill the lycanthrope
and get her back to the states

941
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,741
where we can help her.

942
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,577
If we leave him where
he is, he'll die anyway.

943
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,204
It's the humanitarian
thing to do.

944
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,331
Either kill him, or let him go.

945
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,250
 Is there anything you can do?

946
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,419
Or am I going to turn
like that thing out there?

947
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,212
 I'm not sure yet.

948
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:31,174
But now I'll show you
why I became a scientist.

949
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,010
Just lie calm and relax.

950
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,888
Go ahead and give
her a sedative.

951
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,181
 I feel myself changing.

952
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,516
 Of course you do.

953
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,268
Now just relax.

954
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,978
 What are you telling her?

955
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,187
She's not changing.

956
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:52,154
What kind of mind game are
you playing here anyway?

957
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,531
You're trying to
control her, aren't you?

958
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,907
 I'm not doing a thing to her.

959
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,118
She's going to do
it all to herself.

960
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,745
That's the strange
thing about science.

961
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,289
All I've got to do is observe.

962
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,290
She's a simple native.

963
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,833
Her mind is weak.

964
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,627
It's the power of suggestion.

965
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,505
 I'm sorry, but I can't let
you do this, husband or not.

966
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,257
 You didn't feel the
necessity to bring

967
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,177
back the lycanthrope for study,
so I'll create one of my own.

968
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,386
 That's impossible.

969
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,388
 Not with the human mind.

970
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,557
By taking her back, we'll be
able to observe her through all

971
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,142
the stages of change.

972
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,894
And by letting
Kevin go free, I'll

973
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,146
be able to come back and see how
an advanced case of lycanthropy

974
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,939
develops.

975
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,858
 You talk about
Kevin and Rosary

976
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:34,154
as if there were some
kind of lab experiment.

977
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,239
And Rosary's not
even lycanthropic.

978
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,700
 Not yet, but she may well be.

979
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,120
She's well on her way to
becoming quite insane.

980
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,039
 This is a side of you
I've never seen, Ivan.

981
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,208
 It's what I do, darling.

982
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,753
I study the human mind, and
you protect the environment.

983
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,880
And our government pays us
quite well, if you'll remember.

984
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,839
 But this is cruel.

985
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,216
 This is science.

986
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,051
 Now give her a sedative.

987
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,385
I'll take care of the rest.

988
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,270
 Please help me.

989
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,688
 No, don't worry.

990
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,317
Everything's going to
be just fine, I promise.

991
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,111
I'll give you something
to help you sleep, OK?

992
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:24,204
 Is everything all right, Cody?

993
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,957
 He's been quiet for
almost 30 minutes.

994
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,792
 You're against taking
him back, I suppose?

995
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,962
 It's a risk we
don't have to take.

996
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,840
 If man didn't take risks,
where would we be today?

997
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,091
No tools.

998
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:36,967
The luxuries.

999
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,426
No atom bomb.

1000
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,096
 The world would be
a far better place.

1001
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,013
 For you, my friend.

1002
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,265
You're a survivalist.

1003
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,308
You like living
hand-to-mouth, coming

1004
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,562
and going as you please,
nothing to tie you down,

1005
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,105
no business to keep up.

1006
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,898
Just the survival
of the fittest.

1007
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,748
 Dr. Stein!

1008
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,209
 Stay where you are, Cody.

1009
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,128
 Stay away from that door.

1010
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,463
 I may not be as good a
shot as you or Mr. Parker,

1011
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:19,634
but I will hit something
vital at this close range.

1012
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,594
 Think of what you're doing.

1013
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,970
[gunshots]

1014
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,249
 Cody.

1015
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,842
What happened?

1016
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:01,635
 Stein.

1017
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,348
 Son of a bitch.

1018
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,477
[screams]

1019
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,354
[gunshots]

1020
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,326
 Come in, Mr. Parker.

1021
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,411
Drop your gun on the floor.

1022
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,622
Kick it over here.

1023
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,957
Have a seat.

1024
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,009
 What the hell is going on?

1025
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,594
 He's lost his mind, Bill.

1026
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,470
Yeah, I know.

1027
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:49,307
He just killed Cody.

1028
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,768
 Was he your
favorite, my darling?

1029
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,520
I'd like to say it
was either him or me,

1030
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,898
but I don't think Mr. Carlson
would have pulled the trigger.

1031
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,442
He wasn't half the beast
you made him out to be.

1032
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,152
 What did she
tell you about me?

1033
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,447
 Oh, you would have
shot me dead, Mr. Parker.

1034
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,325
 You've got to stop him, Bill.

1035
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,037
He's turning Rosary
into a lycanthrope.

1036
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,038
 How?

1037
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,124
 It's a mind control thing.

1038
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,167
Suggestion.

1039
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:20,130
As a matter of fact, she's
become quite lycanthropic.

1040
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,589
 That's impossible.

1041
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,925
It hasn't even been
three hours yet.

1042
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,386
 It's a form of
insanity, my darling.

1043
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:27,721
We know very little about it.

1044
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:28,972
We must study it.

1045
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,640
 What's he talking
about, Sheila?

1046
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,977
 He's convinced her she's
been bitten by a werewolf.

1047
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,937
 It's a disease, Mr. Parker.

1048
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,064
Insanity, remember?

1049
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,441
We know very little about it.

1050
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,900
We must study it.

1051
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,986
 She's going to turn
into one of those things?

1052
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:48,825
 She has become one of those
things, haven't you, my dear?

1053
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,493
 This has got to
be a bad dream.

1054
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,745
 Oh, no.

1055
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,538
I assure you it's
a very good dream,

1056
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,331
a scientist's dream come true.

1057
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,376
 Well, somewhere along the
line, doctor, you've become

1058
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,295
very side-tracked.

1059
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,921
I was supposed to come
down here and help

1060
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,923
you find the data that
your team compiled

1061
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,384
about the loss of the ozone.

1062
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,261
I think you told me that
the fate of the world

1063
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,471
depended on it.

1064
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,513
Well, I'm convinced.

1065
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,098
I've seen your lycanthrope, OK?

1066
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,516
DR. STEIN: But we
were also supposed

1067
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,101
to find out what
happened here, and that's

1068
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,603
precisely what I'm doing.

1069
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,272
A find like this comes
along once in a lifetime.

1070
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,940
 A find?

1071
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,486
You call a murderous
monster a scientific find?

1072
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,197
 I can't explain it to you if
you won't have an open mind.

1073
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,114
 Stop!

1074
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,199
It's my life's work!

1075
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,075
[screams]

1076
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,451
[gunshot]

1077
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:35,872
 Sit down!

1078
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,297
Too bad.

1079
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,592
I'd hoped she'd be the
one I could take back.

1080
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:51,679
Now I'll have to tranquilizer
Mr. Johnson and take him back.

1081
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,057
 You'll never be able to
take him alive, doctor.

1082
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,267
He's just going to kill
you and come back after us.

1083
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,061
 It's a risk I'll have to take.

1084
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,563
SHEILA STEIN: You're a murderer.

1085
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,898
 Tie him up.

1086
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,567
 Listen, doctor, you
want to capture him,

1087
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,028
you got to let us help you.

1088
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,822
 Sorry, but that won't work.

1089
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,616
 You've never going to
be able to do it alone.

1090
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,369
 There's a definite
conflict of interests here.

1091
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,412
You're witnesses to a murder.

1092
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,583
I've got to figure out
what to do with you two.

1093
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,001
 I'm sorry.

1094
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,838
 It's not your fault.

1095
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,632
 I guess a double dose
should do the trick.

1096
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,134
 You're just going
to walk up to him

1097
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,718
and ask him to drop his pants?

1098
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,096
 Let me worry about that.

1099
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:33,888
Come here, my dear.

1100
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:42,313
 What are you going to do?

1101
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,940
 You didn't think I
was going to tie him up

1102
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,151
and leave you loose, did you?

1103
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:50,655
Even if you are right and
I am mad, I'm not stupid.

1104
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,198
 Well, I wouldn't call
going after that thing

1105
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,492
with a syringe exactly bright.

1106
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,494
 Someday, you'll understand.

1107
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,375
 Psst.

1108
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,251
The knife.

1109
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,294
 What?

1110
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,336
 Rosary's knife.

1111
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,122
[squeaking]

1112
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,336
[squeaking]

1113
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,340
 Wait!

1114
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,801
I'm not going to hurt you.

1115
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,262
Wait, Kevin.

1116
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:41,724
Think of it-- you're going
to be a great discovery.

1117
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:46,771
Imagine, a man who
thinks himself a wolf.

1118
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:47,689
Wait, wait!

1119
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,613
 Take your papers.

1120
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,489
 Got them.

1121
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,282
 Come on.

1122
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,739
 I'm not going to hurt you.

1123
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,952
I'm not going to
let anyone hurt you.

1124
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:54,172
I'm just going to put you
to sleep for a little while,

1125
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:57,133
take you home.

1126
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,634
[screaming]

1127
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,594
[screams]

1128
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:00,595
 You'll hit Ivan.

1129
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:03,556
 I don't care.

1130
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,391
[gunshots]

1131
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,521
 You hit him.

1132
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,273
 If it bleeds, I can kill it.

1133
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,968
[screams]

1134
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,803
[gunshots]

1135
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,397
[howls]

1136
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,357
[gunshot]

1137
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,068
 Silver bullets, my ass.

1138
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,456
 Well, Rosary, what do you
say we blow this pop stand?

1139
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,106
[breathing]

1140
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,079
[monkey squealing]

1141
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,082
[heartbeat]

1142
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,057
[animal noises]

1143
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:10,840
[screams]
- Hey, hey, hey.

1144
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,757
Relax.

1145
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,300
It's just a dream.

1146
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,176
 Wow.

1147
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,803
It seemed so real.

1148
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,848
 Yeah, well the bad
ones generally do.

1149
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:19,765
 Is this normal?

1150
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,267
 Normal?

1151
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,060
For who?

1152
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,855
Look, you've been through a lot.

1153
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,232
I'll have the nurse stop
in and give you a sedative.

1154
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,025
It'll help you sleep.
- Oh, no.

1155
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,068
I don't want to sleep.

1156
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,403
The dream.

1157
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,363
 Yeah.

1158
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,282
Jake said he could set you up
with some counseling in Rio.

1159
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,325
 Jake?
You spoke to Jake?

1160
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,535
 Yeah.

1161
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,745
You know, if I
didn't know better,

1162
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:43,873
I'd say he was
checking up on you.

1163
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,958
He told me the whole story.

1164
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,170
You know, you are one
tough little girl.

1165
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:53,132
He wants to take you home.

1166
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,176
This came for you.

1167
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:56,052
 What is it?

1168
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,094
 It's a card.

1169
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,138
Open it and see.

1170
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,389
 It's from Jake.

1171
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,516
 No!
What is it?

1172
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,315
A silver bullet?

1173
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:13,027
 A friend of mine gave me this.

1174
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,904
Doctor, when can I go home?

1175
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,115
 Well, as a matter of
fact, I told Jake he could

1176
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,533
come pick you up tomorrow.

1177
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:20,409
 Tomorrow?

1178
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,577
So soon?

1179
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,829
 Well, aside from
loss of blood,

1180
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,040
some dehydration and fatigue--

1181
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,792
and I took a piece of
lead out of your side

1182
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,710
about the size of a quarter.

1183
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,462
There's nothing I
can do for you now.

1184
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:36,217
There's no reason why you
can't go home and recuperate.

1185
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,885
You could recuperate
on a beach in Rio.

1186
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:39,720
Let me take a look.

1187
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,805
Now breath.

1188
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:47,186
One more time.

1189
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,272
Heart seems to be working.

1190
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,441
 Well, how does it look?

1191
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,528
 On you, my darling,
anything would look good.

1192
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,862
 You are too kind.

1193
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,115
 Look, I have some
other rounds to make.

1194
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,617
I'll be back to
check on you later.

1195
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,452
I'll have the nurse come in
and give you that sedative.

1196
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,831
Try to get some rest.

1197
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,499
I'll try.

1198
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:11,126
But I keep on having this
dream I'm turning into a wolf.

1199
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,044
 It's all right.

1200
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,337
The sedative will work.

1201
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,213
I promise.

1202
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,090
 I don't know, doctor.

1203
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,510
 Rosary, there's no
such thing as a werewolf.

1204
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,847
You were bitten by
a man, a human--

1205
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:26,141
not a werewolf, but a human, OK?

1206
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:31,063
Just keep telling yourself,
no such thing as werewolves.

1207
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,022
 Yeah.

1208
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:32,940
Sure.

1209
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,150
Whatever you say.

1210
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,534
Whatever you say.

1211
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:50,541
 Sally?

1212
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:51,792
 Yes, doctor?

1213
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,544
 You need to check
the girl's vitals.

1214
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:55,296
And a sedative,
something strong,

1215
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,714
something to help her sleep.

1216
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:57,631
 OK.

1217
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,883
Poor thing.

1218
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,301
She's been through
a lot, hasn't she?

1219
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,012
 Yeah, but I'm going
to let her go tomorrow.

1220
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,389
 Do you think that's
a wise decision?

1221
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,765
 Doesn't matter.

1222
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,183
There's nothing more
we can do for her here.

1223
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,184
 All right.

1224
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,895
Well, I'll take care of it.

1225
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,865
[screams]

1226
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,799
 You know, I've been doing
your country's dirty work--

1227
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,467
 Our country's dirty work.

1228
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,052
 Right, our country's dirty
work for the last 10 years.

1229
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,929
I hear I'm one of the best
special agents around.

1230
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,264
 Yeah-- I think you
started that move.

1231
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:31,767
 Yeah, I can't find
out what's going on.

1232
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,185
- Excuse me.
- Why are we here--

1233
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,269
DIRECTOR: That's got it.
Do it again.

1234
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,729
 Why?
That was fucking great.

1235
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,901
 Understanding as ever.

1236
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,861
No wonder she left you.

1237
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,238
 Fuck you.

1238
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:45,739
 That's no way to talk
an old friend Bill.

1239
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:46,740
 You ate her--

1240
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,242
 You need my help.

1241
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,118
DIRECTOR: Cut.

1242
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,290
 You didn't think I
was going to tie him up

1243
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,917
and leave you loose, did you?

1244
01:19:56,917 --> 01:20:03,090
Even if you are right and
I am mad, I'm not stupid.

1245
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,801
 Well, I wouldn't call going
after that thing with a syringe

1246
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,802
exactly right.

1247
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,221
 Someday, you'll understand.

1248
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,684
 Psst, the knife.

1249
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,273
 I think we're--

1250
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:22,776
[laughter]

1251
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:26,572
 You have quite a reputation
and come highly recommended.

1252
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:27,781
I've been convinced
that you are one

1253
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,033
of the best men for the job.

1254
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,909
 Yeah, what job is that?

1255
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,828
 Escorting my wife
and me back to our--

1256
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:33,704
shit.

1257
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:34,621
DIRECTOR: Cut.

1258
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:35,998
Take two.

1259
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,751
 Escorting me and
my wife-- oh, shit.

1260
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:39,877
DIRECTOR: Cut.

1261
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,587
 That line.

1262
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,298
Escorting my wife and me back
to our outpost in the Amazon

1263
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:46,008
and finding out what happened
to my scientific team.

1264
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,177
 Uh, excuse me, doctor.

1265
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,303
What makes you think?

1266
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:53,182
[babble]

1267
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,558
DIRECTOR: 68, take four.

1268
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,981
You think you hear something.

1269
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,649
 Who's there?

1270
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,652
Lee, is that you?

1271
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,529
DIRECTOR: You're sure you do.

1272
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,957
BILL PARKER: Somewhere along
the line you got side-tracked,

1273
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:20,334
doctor.

1274
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,919
I was supposed to help
you find and return

1275
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:23,420
data compiled by your
associates to repair the ozone.

1276
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,963
I believe the fate of
the world depended on it.

1277
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,215
Now that I've seen your
lycanthrope, I'm convinced.

1278
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,424
DR. STEIN: But we
were also supposed

1279
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,509
to find out what happened.

1280
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:29,927
DIRECTOR: Cut.

48, take two.

1282
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,182
 Who's he?

1283
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,476
 Dr. Springer.

1284
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:41,396
Got a real pretty mouth
on him, doesn't he?

1285
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,773
 He squealed like a pig.

1286
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:43,649
Look at him now.

1287
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:45,526
[laughter]

1288
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:46,527
 Who's he?

1289
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:47,319
 Dr. Springer.

1290
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:53,033
 Fucking Romulans.

1291
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,368
 Excuse me?

01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:55,786
DIRECTOR: Cut.

23L, take four.

1294
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,917
Action.

1295
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,294
JAKE: A nice cold beer
sure does hit the spot.

1296
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:08,132
 That is does, Jake.

1297
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,425

1298
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,971
DIRECTOR: Cut.

1299
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:14,888
Speed.

1300
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:17,641
Mark.

[MUSIC - PITCH BLUE JAM, "TAKE A
 REST"]

SONG: Mississippi delta.

1303
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:40,080
Hot day, crying child.

1304
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,459
Mother, no father.

1305
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,961
Yeah, the river runs wild.

1306
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,967
No idea.

1307
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:55,429
And a thoughtless brow.

1308
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:59,850
Like the people of the daily.

1309
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,811
Be the youth too wild.

1310
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:07,733
You got to take a rest now.

1311
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:11,653
Take it easy.

1312
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:15,115
Take a rest now, baby.

1313
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:15,949
Take it easy.

1314
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:27,044
Man and a boy are staring
at the edge of the pond.

1315
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:33,050
One sees days to go while
one sees days long gone.

1316
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,135
Yeah.

1317
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:42,351
Restless pond, and
a reminiscing smile.

1318
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:47,439
The man and a boy, they're gonna
take a little rest for a while.

1319
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,232
Take it easy, baby.

1320
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,658
Take a rest now.

1321
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,326
Take it easy.

1322
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:47,749
Take a rest now, baby.

1323
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,251
Take it easy.

1324
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:55,549
You got to-- got to
take a rest now, baby.

1325
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:57,968
Want to take it easy now.

1326
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:01,138
You got to take a rest now.

1327
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,268
Take it easy.
