00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,859
Welcome back to
rock talk with Mitch LeFon,

2
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,349
and it has come to my attention
that filmmaker Drew Fortier,

3
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,994
along with James L.
Edwards and Douglas Esper,

4
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,009
have been reported missing today.

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,279
Details are scarce at the moment,

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,809
but according to the authorities,

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,929
they were last seen two
days ago in Canton, Ohio,

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,359
where they were shooting a documentary

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,479
on the disappearance of the homeless.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,209
The film is also being co-produced

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,809
by David Ellefson of Megadeth fame,

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,229
and Thom Hazaert of Ellefson Films.

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,919
Ellefson and Hazaert have declined

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,489
to comment on the situation

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,593
and I will keep you posted
as more details surface.

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,870
Mr Esper.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mr Esper.

18
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,679
Mr Esper, I'm Inspector Dotani.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,023
We're gonna be filming
our little sit down here,

20
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,799
and I'm gonna need your full attention,

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,939
'cause your story's all over the place

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,190
and we're gonna need to
get on the same page.

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,423
Mr Esper, your attention, please.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,350
I already talked to the cops.

25
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,150
I don't know why I'm here.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,163
Who are you?

27
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:45,899
We're not here to talk about me, okay?

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,149
We're here to talk about your story

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,283
and what you've gone through, okay?

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,129
Where's James and Drew?

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,149
All right, listen, Mr Esper,

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,739
you're facing some very
serious charges here, okay?

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,389
Until we can get to the bottom of this,

34
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,223
you're gonna be in a
whole world of trouble.

35
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:01,249
- Watch the footage.
- I've seen the footage, okay.

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,596
I want to hear this in
your own words, okay?

37
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,097
What did you see in the sewer?

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
I need a minute.

39
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,289
I need a minute, I.

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,129
Okay look, we don't have time for that.

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,680
What did you see in the sewers?

42
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:24,390
All right, tell you what,

43
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,073
let's just start from the beginning.

44
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,219
It looks like this was some
sort of documentary project

45
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,420
you guys threw together?

46
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,399
Yeah, it was, it was Drew's thing.

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,813
He got us all together.

48
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,490
I was just along for the ride.

49
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,704
All right.

50
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,873
Hey, this is Drew Fortier.

51
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,839
I'm on my way to a pre-production meeting

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,484
with David Ellefson and Thom Hazaert

53
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,818
out of Ellefson Films, to discuss our.

54
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,484
Take two.

55
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,119
Hey, this is Drew Fortier.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,860
I'm on my way to a
pre-production meeting with.

57
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,439
Currently on my way, on the road,

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,039
to go meet up with David Ellefson

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,629
and Thom Hazaert of Ellefson Films

60
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,259
to discuss our upcoming film project.

61
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,910
And I figured I'd make a video diary

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,299
to capture the stuff behind the stuff,

63
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,369
which has always fascinated me,

64
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,270
hopefully it'll fascinate you as well.

65
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,867
Here at the hotel.

66
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,139
Thom.

67
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,504
Yeah.

68
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:03,955
Turn your fucking camera off.

69
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,335
This isn't a social call,
turn the fucking camera off.

70
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,789
Come in, sit.

71
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,772
Oh dude, I gotta run, man.
I'll hit you back, all right?

72
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:15,670
See ya, bye.

73
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,335
- What's up, dude?
- What are you doing here?

74
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:20,559
Where, where, oh where,
is our fucking movie, Drew?

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,459
I don't know.

76
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,519
We gave you this money months
and months and months ago.

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,749
I've been asking you for footage.

78
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,369
We haven't seen a second
of footage, not a second.

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,649
Do you have any?

80
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,979
Is anything done?

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,375
Well there's certain
elements I gotta prepare,

82
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:34,209
you know, and if it.

83
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,499
We're not making gone
with the fucking wind.

84
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,719
Take your camera, point it
at some homeless people, cut.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,809
That's all you need to do.

86
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,899
I didn't know the stuff takes.

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,810
Listen, dude, here's the deal.

88
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,329
You are in breach of contract.

89
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,210
We gave you the money.

90
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,043
We were supposed to.

91
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:50,709
This thing was supposed to be done, okay?

92
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,999
Today's Friday.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,229
Our tour's ending.

94
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,069
I want to see this by end
of day Sunday at the latest.

95
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,829
This is not gonna tarnish my reputation,

96
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,109
because if it tarnishes my reputation,

97
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,149
it's tarnishing yours.

98
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,349
What reputation?

99
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,359
You made the fucking "Ben Tango" movie.

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,634
What reputation are you gonna tarnish?

101
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:05,636
Well put.

102
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:06,709
Who's your crew?

103
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,089
Do you hire, have you hired anybody?

104
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,767
Where's our money? Did
you hire a fucking crew?

105
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,859
Have you done anything?

106
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,729
Oh yeah, James Edwards
and Douglas Esper.

107
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,600
Who's that?

108
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,779
That's your fucking crew.

109
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,359
Doug Esper and James?

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,539
We give you money to hire a real crew,

111
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,239
rent real equipment, and
make a fucking movie.

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,189
I have 15 fucking chimps with a Nikon

113
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,741
that could shoot this movie.

114
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,929
And if it's not done, they will.

115
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,989
We gotta go to sound check.

116
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,139
Let's get out of here.

117
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,226
Shit.

118
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:33,510
Fricking never ends, man.

119
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,533
- No shit, always something.
- Always something, isn't it?

120
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:37,702
Unreal.
Fuck.

121
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,795
Ah fuck.

122
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:45,051
Feel free to show yourself out.

123
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,052
God.

124
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,419
Oh fuck!

125
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,439
So now I gotta film a whole fucking movie

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,139
over one fucking weekend!

127
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,999
So I don't get fucking sued.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,672
You wanted the shit behind the shit.

129
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:05,649
You wanted the stuff behind
the stuff? Well you fucking go!

130
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,469
Stupid fucking camera bullshit filmmaking,

131
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,326
cock sucking motherfucker,
yappa douche bag, piece of shit!

132
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,529
That's why they create medication.

133
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,375
This is why they create medication.

134
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,919
It's okay, it's all right, it's all right.

135
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,913
This is, it's okay, it's all right.

136
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,836
Everything's gonna be just fine.

137
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,445
You're gonna get such a
kick out of this, though.

138
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,662
This is gonna be good.

139
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:35,496
This is gonna be good.

140
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,749
Well the good news is I'm gonna
be early to James's house,

141
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,480
so that's good, right?

142
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,314
There we go.

143
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:43,215
It's real to get back on track with that

144
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:45,883
but he's not expecting me to
show up this fucking early!

145
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,703
Oh, hey.

146
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,139
Hey James, how you doing?

147
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,140
Drew.

148
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,132
Remember that conversation
we had about time management?

149
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,852
Yeah, back when I showed up late for,

150
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,759
late for everything all the time, sure.

151
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,809
Showing up four hours early
for a pre-production meeting

152
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,710
doesn't exactly make up for lost time.

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,340
All right, I give up.

154
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:12,539
What's with the camera?

155
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,689
Ah it's for behind the
scenes for the Ellefson thing.

156
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,319
It's no big deal.

157
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,209
So you're creating
more work for yourself.

158
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,110
Your ignorance has always been
outshined by your ambition.

159
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,489
Was that a compliment?

160
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,079
All right, let's cut the shit.

161
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,639
Why are you impending on my coffee time

162
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,839
and sweating all over my couch?

163
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay I, you want the,

164
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,889
you want the short
story of the long story?

165
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,908
Short, damn it.

166
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:40,683
All right, Ellefson needs
us to start shooting ASAP.

167
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,870
What's the new start date?

168
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,253
This weekend, starting today.

169
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,773
Okay, now, now this, this really me off.

170
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,799
I figured this meeting
was gonna take an hour,

171
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,349
two at the max, okay?

172
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,999
Now instead, you show up four hours early,

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,819
you've canceled my weekend plans,

174
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,969
and now I have to go upstairs
and put pants on and work.

175
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,767
I know, I know, I know, James.

176
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,479
No, you don't know, Drew.

177
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,233
Ellefson wants to bonus us
out for the inconvenience.

178
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,959
How much?

179
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
500?

180
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,480
So what are we shooting today?

181
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,336
Well.

182
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,149
Who the hell is that?

183
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,983
Oh, it's Doug.

184
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:22,879
What is Doug doing at my house?

185
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,753
He's the third
member of the crew.

186
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,290
Dynamic.

187
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,943
Come on.

188
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,239
Doug, what
the hell are you doing?

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,073
Oh, hey.

190
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:35,168
James, what's up?

191
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,169
It's Drew.

192
00:08:37,106 --> 00:08:38,009
It's Drew.

193
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,168
You guys are like twins, man.

194
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,673
I hope not.

195
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:43,506
What were you doing?

196
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:45,829
All right, have a seat.

197
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,629
Hey, James, what's happening?

198
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,630
Hey, Doug.

199
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,009
Have a seat, get comfy, take a load off.

200
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,519
Can I go in the kitchen
and make you a Hot Pocket?

201
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,959
Oh, that'd be perfect, man.

202
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,006
Thanks, what kind you got?

203
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:57,840
Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug.

204
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,673
Here, check this out.

205
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:00,979
Look, this is gonna be one
of your jobs for the weekend.

206
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,819
The weekend?

207
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,279
I thought this was like a one day thing.

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,239
Typical Drew, always
forgetting the important details,

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,239
but hitting you with the
last minute bullshit.

210
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,409
I really don't
have anything going on.

211
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,410
This is cool.

212
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,209
What exactly are we shooting today?

213
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,499
I figured we'd start with
like the homeless interviews

214
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,719
and just take it from there.

215
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,059
Gotcha.

216
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,949
I am so confused.

217
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,550
Oh, it's all gonna make sense.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,779
You're gonna get such a
huge kick out of this.

219
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
No you're not.

220
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:35,793
Are you aware that
Drew has fraudulent past?

221
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,233
Drew's not a con.

222
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,049
Did you know anything about this project

223
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,050
prior to the shoot?

224
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,510
No.

225
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,389
Drew told me when and where to show up.

226
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,809
I showed up.

227
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,010
So no questions asked?

228
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,483
That's typical Drew.

229
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,759
It's always confusing at first,

230
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,229
but in the end it makes sense.

231
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,261
Really? Does to make a lot of sense

232
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,222
you're sitting in an
interrogation room right now?

233
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Does he pay you?

234
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,739
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

235
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,139
So James, you
did put on pants, right?

236
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,358
- Yes, I did.
- Oh yeah, that's good.

237
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:23,679
I'm not thrilled
about it, but I did it.

238
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,133
Sacrificing for the art.

239
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,843
Indubitably.

240
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:28,149
All right, Doug, Doug.

241
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,942
So you're from the area,
and you're familiar

242
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,643
with the ridiculous homeless
population, I'm assuming.

243
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,910
It's out of control, man.

244
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,743
I mean, look around.

245
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:37,239
Every parking lot you go to,

246
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,769
two or three guys asking you for money.

247
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,818
It's an extra quarter to
go to the gas station.

248
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:43,329
Want to get groceries, it's
gonna cost you a dollar.

249
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,479
They're everywhere.

250
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,313
Well, they were everywhere.

251
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:48,185
Have you noticed being asked
by them less and less lately?

252
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,113
I guess not.

253
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,260
Well, that's exactly
what this is all about.

254
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:54,440
Huh?

255
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,606
Okay so, so the past few months

256
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:59,269
there's been this huge surge
of missing persons reports,

257
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,349
and it's all homeless people.

258
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,509
We're doing a documentary
on the homeless population.

259
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,343
Yeah, in a way.

260
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:07,519
But the hook is nobody gives a shit.

261
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,976
Press, local authorities.

262
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:11,049
You know, nobody cares.

263
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,909
But what we're doing is
building awareness, you know.

264
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,743
To see if we can find out

265
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:16,679
what the fuck happened to these people.

266
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,619
Starting with interviewing homeless people

267
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
who aren't missing.

268
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,240
That's pretty nice of us.

269
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,770
All right.

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Looks like hobo heaven
over here. Look at this.

271
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,510
Wow.

272
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,953
I always see a ton of
homeless people over here, so.

273
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,228
Let's check it out.

274
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,253
You take me to all of
the best places, Drew.

275
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,829
I'm happy to be alive at this point.

276
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,830
Yeah.

277
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,203
All right, let's take a walk
around the train over here.

278
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,500
Here, why
don't I hold the camera?

279
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,800
Yeah, that works.

280
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,089
Remember to just leave it as is,

281
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,449
because your eyes are terrible,

282
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,029
to be perfectly blunt with you, all right?

283
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,330
- All right, man.
- Okay.

284
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,300
Geez.

285
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,381
I'm trying to help you out.

286
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,009
Drew.

287
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,489
Hey Doug, you
don't get to see anything.

288
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,899
I know, just give me the camera.

289
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,333
'Cause you actually don't
know how to focus for shit.

290
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,331
Yeah, there we go.

291
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,033
What the actual fuck?

292
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:33,889
Uh-huh.

293
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,059
We James, you're the producer.

294
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,260
So why don't you go
produce us an interview?

295
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Excuse me, sir.

296
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,549
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but could we,

297
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,552
could we have a few words with you?

298
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:48,088
What's this about?

299
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,199
Oh, we're just doing a documentary

300
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,259
on the homeless population.

301
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,299
I was wondering if you might be able

302
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,189
to talk to us for a little bit.

303
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,190
Okay.

304
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,613
By any chance,

305
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:01,689
do either of you find gentlemen
happen to have a cigarette?

306
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,289
Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

307
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,290
Great.

308
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:06,343
That's a good brand.

309
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,446
I think we're done here.

310
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:12,279
Wait, wait.

311
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,623
Wait, wait, James,
James, before you leave,

312
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,733
will you be my lookout?

313
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,129
Will you be my lookout, James?

314
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,519
No, no, no, really, really.

315
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,190
James, do you know what it's like

316
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,963
to try to masturbate in
private when you're homeless?

317
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,090
Do you have any idea?

318
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,453
Can you just, five minutes.

319
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,528
You?

320
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:37,362
One of you?

321
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,359
Doug, I think
I got a job for ya.

322
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,363
Excuse me, miss.

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,123
Hi, we're,

324
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,209
we're harmless, we're harmless.

325
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,710
We were just hoping to ask
you a couple questions.

326
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
What?

327
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,093
Ah, ah.

328
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,523
She's afraid of
the eye thing over there.

329
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,074
That's just graffiti.

330
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,408
- No, ah.
- We gotta go back.

331
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,299
We'll get you
safely away from the eye,

332
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,533
and we'll, maybe we can
ask you a couple questions,

333
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,750
that has nothing to do
with the eye over there.

334
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,239
Come on, man.

335
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,307
Now the eye's starting to creep me out.

336
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,009
- Doug.
- I'm gonna cross my fingers,

337
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,407
and then, then I can.
You're good.

338
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:26,419
Then I can't, then
I can't, then I can't.

339
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,571
Come on over, come on over.

340
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:28,655
Okay, okay.

341
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,939
Just cross your, will you cross them?

342
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,203
Yup, fingers are
crossed, fingers are crossed.

343
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,471
Everybody got
their fingers crossed?

344
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,179
- Yup.
- All right.

345
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,013
- Okay.
- Let's go.

346
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,680
So how long have you been homeless?

347
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,229
Who wants to know?

348
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,230
Just us.

349
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,429
No, who wants to know?

350
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,069
Because if it's them,
then I'm not telling you,

351
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,179
but if it's you, that you
want to know, then sure.

352
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,579
I'll tell you, why not?

353
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,227
Sure, but only if it's
you that wants to know.

354
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,301
Who's them?

355
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:00,302
You know who them are.

356
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,932
Um, well yeah,
there's no them here.

357
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:05,559
It's this, this is me, James and Doug.

358
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,399
We're just, you know, just us.

359
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,449
You are them.

360
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,499
I'll only tell if you want to know.

361
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,883
For fuck's sake.

362
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,268
Well, this is turning into
a fucking mental health PSA.

363
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,189
We haven't even gotten
past the first question.

364
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,023
Yeah, maybe we should have

365
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,879
screened some of these people first.

366
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,713
This is good though.

367
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,751
It's real, it's raw. You
know, it's the, you know,

368
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,969
the real people of the streets.

369
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,879
This is what people need to see.

370
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,109
But, I'm sure we'll find

371
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,054
some more sane candidates eventually.

372
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:34,779
We just gotta keep on looking.

373
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,316
Hey James.
Yeah?

374
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,639
Got a cigarette?

375
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,473
Go fuck yourself.
Oh.

376
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:40,149
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

377
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,735
Oh, oh, oh, speaking about Jay, Doug.

378
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:43,630
Oh Christ.

379
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:45,929
So the first couple
of weeks I knew James,

380
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,399
I actually thought he was
the guy pink "Clerks."

381
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,233
Wait, he's not?

382
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:50,749
That's what I said.

383
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,922
You guys realize I have the car keys

384
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:54,323
and I can abandon you at any time, right?

385
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,104
All right, so by this point,

386
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:58,938
don't you think this whole thing

387
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:00,253
was a complete waste of time?

388
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,893
At first, yeah.

389
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,418
But the more we talked to the homeless,

390
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,119
they knew something.

391
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,679
They, they had seen something.

392
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,699
Okay, and these homeless people,

393
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,100
did they sign release forms?

394
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,099
No, not that I recall, no.

395
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Uh-huh.

396
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,910
Where do you, where do you sleep?

397
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:32,029
Everywhere and anywhere.

398
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,723
I used to be a dweller, but I,

399
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,290
I realized that I was
better off above ground.

400
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,913
A dweller?

401
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,967
I was one for a while.

402
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:45,959
Could you
explain what a dweller is?

403
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,389
Well, there's a whole
population of us in the sewers.

404
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,049
Or, or was at least.

405
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,899
We all relocated underground and said,

406
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,409
fuck everything above ground.

407
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,069
Shit, we wanted to go missing.

408
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,883
About 40 or 50 of us down there.

409
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:04,899
A whole community scattered
all over the sewer system.

410
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,108
Almost like it's own little

411
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,771
self-sustaining world in the sewers.

412
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:12,680
Then our missing homeless,
started going missing.

413
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,448
Yeah, I remember hearing about them.

414
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,909
The stories that circulate
in the undergrounders.

415
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,469
The shining started happening,

416
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,929
I got the fuck back up here.

417
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,630
Lived every day trying to
forget what I heard and saw.

418
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,603
Which was?

419
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:29,882
The manifestation of everything
you never want to see it

420
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,839
in an almost pitch black tunnel.

421
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,480
I don't really talk about it.

422
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:36,564
It's just fucked up, man.

423
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,199
Just don't want to hear about it.

424
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,338
I don't know anything about it.

425
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,252
I don't know, I don't know.

426
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:46,762
I can tell you some shit

427
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,963
that'll make your skin crawl for a week.

428
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,450
Really?

429
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:53,639
I don't know, man.

430
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,639
Fuck, man.

431
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,279
Yeah, I've been hearing
some bad shit going down.

432
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,779
Just know that not too many people

433
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,409
make it out of the sewers and
there's a reason for that.

434
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,963
I had a buddy of mine, Jimmy,

435
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,329
he just disappeared.

436
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,919
I heard he went to someplace

437
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,519
where people were going underground.

438
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,447
Wherever there's like
remains of animals and.

439
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
Even people.

440
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,559
I just, that man, that's
kinda heavy shit right now.

441
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,039
It started with strange noises.

442
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,050
It sounded like a, it's
sounded like a baby crying.

443
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,739
People hear like, like dogs whimpering

444
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,293
or cats, or kids or something.

445
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,129
We kept hearing it echo

446
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,479
throughout the tunnels late at night.

447
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,539
And finally some of us
went to check it out

448
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,166
and didn't come back.

449
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,767
And we were all a little
spooked to say the least.

450
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:51,449
If you go underground,
bad stuff happens,

451
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,739
bad crap happens, they
just don't come back.

452
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,679
That's how I think what
happened to my friend, Jimmy.

453
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,589
Is it possible they just
relocated back above ground?

454
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,423
That's what we thought,

455
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:04,104
until we found the parts it didn't like.

456
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:05,560
It didn't like?

457
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,719
I saw it once.

458
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,003
It saw me, too.

459
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,569
I been hearing stuff
about weird kinda creatures.

460
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,403
You know that feeling you get

461
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,439
when someone or something is watching you?

462
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,273
Sure.

463
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:20,909
Well, I woke up one night
down there with that feeling.

464
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,889
I lit a match, and it was
about 10 feet away from me.

465
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,169
It had itself pressed up
against the tunnel wall,

466
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,023
like a fucking spider.

467
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:30,589
Yeah, it's like some creature.

468
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,522
Like some thing with long
fingers and fingernails.

469
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,949
Next thing I know, it
crawled over to me real close

470
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,249
and blew my match out.

471
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,959
Then all I could feel was being dragged

472
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,453
for fuck knows how long.

473
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,769
Then what happened?

474
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,728
I lived to tell the
tale, that's what happened.

475
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,399
Fortunately, I didn't go
missing like the rest,

476
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,883
but a big piece of me did.

477
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,183
We came through an
abandoned intersection tunnel.

478
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,729
Derek, Derek peaked in,

479
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,630
he said he could see something moving.

480
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,779
Then with as quick as it
takes a match to blow out,

481
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,403
all I could hear was Derek
gurgling in his own blood.

482
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,089
I got back in and nobody could believe me.

483
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,249
Where do you think they came from?

484
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,663
Hell man, I don't know.

485
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,049
I've been, like I said,

486
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,963
I've been in the military and,

487
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:27,242
I've been to places.

488
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:28,654
There's a lot of weird things that go on

489
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,359
that cannot be explained.

490
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,416
It just can't be explained,
and I can't explain it.

491
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,707
I shouldn't even be talking about it.

492
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,291
Shouldn't have talked about it.

493
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,091
Have you,

494
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:44,549
have you went to the
authorities about this?

495
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,497
Eh, the cops don't give a shit.

496
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,739
The fewer of us they have
to deal with, the better.

497
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,449
Yeah, those fucking assholes did nothing

498
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,310
and ended up throwing me

499
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:55,063
in a fucking psych ward for five days.

500
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,399
The cops have absolutely zero care

501
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,833
about the homeless at all.

502
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,399
Oh, they might take a report,

503
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,999
but it's just like I went
to the cops about Jimmy.

504
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,575
And I seem like, eh, well, you know.

505
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,573
Unless he's been gone for like, you know,

506
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:13,407
a couple of weeks or something like that,

507
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,729
there's really nothing
we could do about it.

508
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,049
So, it seems they just,
they just don't care.

509
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,383
I will tell you this, though.

510
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:24,221
They got real cagey when
I alluded to the fact

511
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:27,959
that I was attacked down in the sewer.

512
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,193
We're a dying breed.

513
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,830
Fucking cops, they're useless.

514
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:37,187
But I guess that's all
part of the plan, right?

515
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Who's plan?

516
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,773
The government.

517
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,059
Some people coming
in and out any minute,

518
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,059
but we're at the local police station,

519
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,459
hopefully to capture
some on camera statements

520
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,829
about the missing homeless people.

521
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,089
Yeah, 'cause
we've had a lot of luck

522
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,649
winging it so far, sure.

523
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,029
I was talking to the camera,
James, but that's all right.

524
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,980
Yeah, so we'll just wait it
out and see what happens.

525
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,993
So far this has
been a waste of time, Drew.

526
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:16,827
We'll find somebody.

527
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:19,126
You know, I'm still gonna work
this guy, he looks important.

528
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,233
Excuse me, sir.

529
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,269
Would it be okay if we ask
you a couple questions?

530
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,270
You guys press?

531
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,103
No.

532
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,999
Podcasters, social media?

533
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,109
What's this for?

534
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,149
We're doing a documentary
on the missing homeless.

535
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,343
Oh, the disappearances.

536
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,349
All right, yeah, I'll answer
some questions on that.

537
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,465
What's your name, sir?

538
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:43,419
You can call me Jenkins.

539
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,289
Judging by
the way you're dressed,

540
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,453
Detective Jenkins?

541
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,049
Sure.

542
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,947
What can you tell
us about the recent surge

543
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:53,833
of disappearances within
the homeless population?

544
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,399
It's not really much different
than any other major city.

545
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,179
A lot of these homeless
like to squeeze into these

546
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,879
sort of hard to get out of spaces,

547
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,580
to try and get warm in the winter.

548
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,199
And they pass out drunk or strung out

549
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,489
and they freeze to death
when the temperature drops.

550
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,899
We find at least a few of them every year

551
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,369
when the weather breaks.

552
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,203
What about the,

553
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:18,553
what about the homeless
that relocated underground?

554
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,379
Well, there's not really
much to talk about there either

555
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,069
that you probably haven't already heard.

556
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,603
I mean the whole thing's been
blown way out of proportion.

557
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:30,427
Try me.

558
00:23:30,428 --> 00:23:31,708
Some people moved underground.

559
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,209
It didn't work out.

560
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,819
I'm sure you've heard the rest.

561
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,009
I want to hear from you.

562
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,850
Why?

563
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,963
It's a dead end, man, trust me.

564
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,089
Yeah, but I'm just
trying to do my job, sir.

565
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,559
I'm just trying to get a
proper on camera statement

566
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,393
from the local authorities

567
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:50,119
in regards to the missing homeless people.

568
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,459
All right, look, guys, I'm really busy,

569
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,039
and it was really nice to me to sit down

570
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,683
and talk with you guys on
camera about this, but,

571
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,569
I really think we're done here.

572
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,223
What about the sightings?

573
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,070
What sightings?

574
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,044
We spoke to a
homeless man earlier.

575
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,709
He said he saw something in the sewer

576
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,813
that attacked and killed his friend.

577
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,070
What kind of something?

578
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:18,904
I don't know.

579
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:21,483
He said he was some kind of creature.

580
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,899
Okay, look, this is getting ridiculous.

581
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,943
How many homeless people
have you interviewed?

582
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,899
Maybe a dozen, per se.

583
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,733
Fair enough.

584
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,979
Out of that dozen, how
many of them would you say

585
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,839
weren't quite mentally there?

586
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,825
- All of them.
- Well not all of them.

587
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:42,739
I mean some seemed completely
coherent and level headed.

588
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,119
And that's exactly my point.

589
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,089
Seemed coherent and level-headed.

590
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,379
You guys gotta remember, these homeless,

591
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,289
they suffer from a multitude of illnesses.

592
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,939
Their grasp on reality isn't great.

593
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,419
Some of them can hold onto their faculties

594
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,253
better than others

595
00:24:57,254 --> 00:25:00,469
and can even cough out a
convincing story when they need to.

596
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,460
And believe me, I know.

597
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,793
I've been doing this quite a long time.

598
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,039
So here's something for you to chew on.

599
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
John Doe.

600
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,939
- Huh?
- John Doe's.

601
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,423
There's you're missing homeless.

602
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,723
I don't get it.

603
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,049
Hospitals, morgues, jails.

604
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,709
We get John Doe's in there all the time.

605
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,279
Bottom line is, you're missing homeless

606
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,853
are either in the hospital,
in jail, or they're dead.

607
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,060
Let me ask you guys a question.

608
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:32,747
You guys have a film permit?

609
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:35,309
Fuck.

610
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,959
Are you kidding
me with this, Drew?

611
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,060
Good day, gentlemen.

612
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,387
What the fuck, man?

613
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:46,339
Hey, come on, Doug.

614
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,693
James, come on, man.

615
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
It's no big deal.

616
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:54,766
At least we didn't get in trouble.

617
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,364
Come on, buddy.

618
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:00,153
Are you still gonna give
me a ride to my car?

619
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,269
Did he say yeah?

620
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,439
How could you possibly
not have gotten a permit?

621
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,149
That is, that is without a doubt

622
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,769
the stupidest shit I've ever heard.

623
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,729
That is filmmaking 101.

624
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,469
It is the easiest shit.

625
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,879
Why is that fucking camera still on?

626
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,109
Dude, we've got to get the stuff

627
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,235
behind the stuff, man.

628
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,069
I guess that's a.
No, you don't.

629
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,019
Shut the fucking thing off.

630
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,853
Did it ever occur to you that maybe Drew

631
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:24,799
was just using you and James?

632
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,693
Doing whatever he could
to appease Ellefson.

633
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,399
I mean, all I know is that, you know,

634
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,419
Ellefson was producing,
Drew was directing.

635
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,669
I don't know why, they always got along.

636
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,799
Why would they have to appease?

637
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,502
Well, put another way.
Do you think he was maybe

638
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:42,709
just trying to do anything he could

639
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,089
to make it look like a documentary?

640
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,119
Because we talked to Ellefson earlier.

641
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,339
We also looked at the footage,

642
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,898
and basically his company fronted Drew

643
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,679
a large sum of money about six months ago.

644
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,369
And it looks like Drew did
absolutely nothing about it

645
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,519
until he was called out by Hazaert.

646
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,673
Drew is not a con, damn it.

647
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,169
All right, you know what?

648
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,749
Let me ask you this.

649
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,650
You did these interviews, this
whole thing hit a dead end.

650
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
Why keep going?

651
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,250
Well, I mean, we
talked to the detective.

652
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,069
He told us nothing was going on.

653
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,209
He said all the right things,
toed the company line.

654
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,410
None of us believed him.

655
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,019
This was before the permit thing.

656
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,409
Okay, saw that on the footage.

657
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,610
But what did you guys
talk about off camera?

658
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,309
James was pissed.

659
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,469
I mean, he stormed off.

660
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,763
I thought we were done, but
Drew found one last guy.

661
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,923
We interviewed him.

662
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,660
He knew how to get down in the sewers.

663
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,279
We rushed in without thinking
about the consequences.

664
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,113
Get in, get in.

665
00:27:55,114 --> 00:27:56,339
Come on, get in, get in.
What?

666
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,159
Dude, we need this, man.

667
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,993
You need this.

668
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,999
I need this like I need a
fucking hole in the head.

669
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,239
Dude, calm down, man.

670
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,669
I'll get you more money, too.

671
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,139
How much?

672
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,799
Double.

673
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,279
What do you know so far?

674
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,260
Well.

675
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,200
Some homeless people

676
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,219
decided to relocate underground,

677
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,642
and then most have said
homeless people went missing.

678
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:17,119
I guess there's something
eating people down there, too.

679
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,923
But apparently there's nothing
going on down there at all.

680
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,843
What?

681
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:22,807
Those stories are shit.

682
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:24,369
How so?

683
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,229
Well for one, the undergrounders

684
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,439
are kind of like, elitist.

685
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,219
They don't want anybody fucking
up their paradise, you know?

686
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,381
So they make up these crazy stories

687
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:34,319
to keep people from going down there

688
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,469
and ruining their little party.

689
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,689
Oh, so they're still
down there and they do exist?

690
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,560
I could show you.

691
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:40,710
It's not far from here.

692
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,223
All right, here it is.

693
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,299
This is as far as I go, though.

694
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,349
You'll find your way in and
out of the sewers all right.

695
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,429
It's not difficult.

696
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,430
Good luck.

697
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:03,003
It's, I guess it's down here.

698
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,569
- Drew.
- Yeah?

699
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,382
Look, I'm willing to do this

700
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:08,846
because you're paying me extra and all,

701
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,114
but I need you to know
something, sincerely.

702
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:12,010
Say it.

703
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,310
I hope you get syphilis.

704
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,230
All right.

705
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,300
Poison ivy in my pants.

706
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,823
Oh, that's a spider web.

707
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:32,453
- Find some bush.
- Oh, there it is.

708
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,710
All right.

709
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,760
Let's go.

710
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,121
Make sure you put that light on.

711
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,963
Be worth to interest me.

712
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,573
It's gonna suck me right in.

713
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,530
It's here.

714
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,133
- It's very charming.
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

715
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,099
I can not believe

716
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,553
that you brought us out
to this fucking place.

717
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,723
I'm dead serious, man.

718
00:30:03,724 --> 00:30:06,619
If I just have to get something
as far as a tetanus shot

719
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,920
after we're done here, you're
getting the bill for it.

720
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,800
Well, I pay
for everything else, so.

721
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:13,801
Ellefson has paid for everything else.

722
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,886
How far are we gonna take this?

723
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:18,720
As far as we need to go

724
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:21,499
till we find some kind
of substantial evidence

725
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,519
that people live down here.

726
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,239
And how do we find evidence
of getting out of here?

727
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,999
You know what, Doug?

728
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,819
You know how to make a map, right?

729
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,653
Just a pen and piece of paper.

730
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:32,939
You've got a piece of paper right there,

731
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,349
and just draw like lines

732
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,699
as to like where we make turns and shit.

733
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,400
So that that's your job right now.

734
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:40,469
This place is amazing.

735
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,580
Wait a second.

736
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,943
Shine a light over there.

737
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,352
What is that?

738
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:55,118
Wait, oh.

739
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,257
Asshole.
Douche bag.

740
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,249
Got my hopes up and
peed myself a little bit

741
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,250
at the same time.

742
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,419
Tell me a little bit, James and Drew.

743
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Did they get along?

744
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:16,869
Yeah, there was a mutual
respect there, you know?

745
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,703
You gotta remember.

746
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:19,943
I mean, we got down in the sewers and,

747
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,763
we were exhausted and they,

748
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:25,969
they bickered.

749
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,829
It got pretty ugly.

750
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,164
Okay.

751
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,765
Did you know that Drew was paying James?

752
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,530
How's that make you feel?

753
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,939
That's about what I thought.

754
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,773
All right.

755
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:44,693
So here we are, in the sewer,

756
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,153
where the dwellers allegedly live.

757
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,850
And we're hoping to

758
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:55,930
find some kind of evidence

759
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,020
that they're actually still down here.

760
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,819
In an effort to capture everything,

761
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,779
we're gonna keep the cameras
rolling till we find something.

762
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Which we will.

763
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:08,244
And.

764
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,331
Look at this.

765
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:20,829
You really think
people live down here?

766
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,830
Yeah.

767
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,928
Which way, which way should we go now?

768
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:28,810
All right, you want to flip a coin?

769
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:30,360
Let's go left.

770
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:31,361
All right.

771
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:39,463
So the way I see it, the way I see,

772
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,842
I never made much money
doing this stuff, you know?

773
00:32:43,843 --> 00:32:45,589
And, you know who else

774
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,474
doesn't make much money
doing anything at all?

775
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:51,029
Doug, come check this out.

776
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,419
Homeless people.

777
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,279
So in that regard,

778
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,099
I feel a special
connection to these people.

779
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,565
Shut up, Drew.

780
00:32:57,566 --> 00:33:02,566
I was 16 years old, had
a high school sweetheart,

781
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:07,710
and we actually reconnected
a couple of years ago

782
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,109
and she was a fat fucking pig.

783
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,383
Hey James, if you will.

784
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:19,709
Oh for fuck's
sake, are you kidding me?

785
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,879
No, it's okay.

786
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,279
We got more light batteries.

787
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,333
Hold on, hold on.

788
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,859
Don't have a fucking pissy fit.

789
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,760
Yeah I think.

790
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,593
Here, here's the bag, here's the bag.

791
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,209
What the?

792
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,649
Well put it the fuck in.

793
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,620
Hold on, hold on.

794
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,793
Just shut the fuck up, please, okay?

795
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,399
Okay, I got it.

796
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,729
Done.
Just five it to me.

797
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,702
For fuck's sake.

798
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,079
Okay, okay.

799
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,230
Come on, man.

800
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,972
- Okay, see, better, light.
- I swear to God,

801
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:56,300
the shit you get me into,
this is fucking absurd.

802
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,050
All right.

803
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,437
See, now I forgot what the
fuck I was gonna say, so.

804
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:25,437
You guys hear something?

805
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,357
Yeah, it's my patience wearing thin.

806
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:30,703
Listen.

807
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,112
Is that a cat?

808
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:47,162
Should we try and find it?

809
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:48,529
Why the would we do that?

810
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,119
The last thing we need is to catch rabies

811
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,570
from some creepy super pussy.

812
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,229
All right, Drew, aside
from a fucking cat meowing,

813
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,619
we haven't found shit.

814
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,883
So unless you've got a game plan,

815
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:26,010
why don't we just start heading back

816
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,549
so I don't spend the rest of my weekend

817
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,603
in a God damn sewer.

818
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,328
You know what the James,

819
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:34,379
I think you got a good point.

820
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,680
Doug, let's have the maps.

821
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,893
Oh yeah, yeah.

822
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:40,609
- Thank you, buddy.
- Sure.

823
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,183
James, hold the camera for a sec.

824
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,570
Drew, you
know you got black shit

825
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,139
all over your neck.

826
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,383
Oh, it's from the headphones.

827
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,659
That or maybe I got that in something.

828
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,789
Drew Fortier
Productions, the sound of quality.

829
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,873
Ellefson films.

830
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,770
Doug,

831
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,029
what the hell is this?

832
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,199
What?

833
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,003
Where's the top and where's the bottom?

834
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:10,360
I don't know.

835
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:12,479
I thought you said you
knew how to do this, right?

836
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,243
Are you fucking kidding?

837
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:15,729
Don't blame me, man.

838
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,379
I'm the go along to get along guy.

839
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,969
I'm not Pablo Picasso mapmaker here.

840
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,539
I just drew lines where we went.

841
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
I don't know.

842
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,849
You're probably not too
happy about this, James,

843
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,499
but all right.

844
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,477
It's all right, we'll,

845
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,877
not too far in where we
can't retrace our steps.

846
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,650
What, you leave
fucking breadcrumbs?

847
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,415
So do you feel responsible
you got everybody lost

848
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,366
because you couldn't make a simple map?

849
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,739
Look, I did the best
I could with what I had.

850
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,779
I don't know what they expected.

851
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,173
We were down in a tunnel.

852
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,573
We were lost.

853
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:02,410
I'm not a map maker.

854
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:03,573
I just.

855
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,329
How'd that make you feel?

856
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,753
I was, I was upset.

857
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,049
Mostly at myself, you know?

858
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,359
I wanted to come through for them.

859
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,423
This was my big opportunity
and I managed to fuck that up.

860
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,842
What are you doing?

861
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,070
Aw man.

862
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,145
I've always wanted to do that.

863
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:34,239
I figured that was good a time as any.

864
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,049
- Oh, now's time where?
- Yeah.

865
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,953
Now's the time?

866
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:37,786
We're down here lost.

867
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:40,499
It's been hours and we
don't know where we are.

868
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,399
And now's the time to
start joking around, huh?

869
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,759
I don't like confined spaces.

870
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,339
I don't even like the sound of my voice

871
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,483
and that's all I can hear.

872
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's go.

873
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Fuck.

874
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,769
All right, let's go this way.

875
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,520
All right assholes, hand it over.

876
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,286
Hand what over?

877
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:11,119
Everything.

878
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,429
The camera, the money, your
wallets and your phones.

879
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,599
This is what happens

880
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,959
when you listen to fucking Drew.

881
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,560
Shut the fuck up, or I'll
stick you, motherfucker.

882
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,875
The camera too, asshole.

883
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:23,259
Give me that.

884
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,619
Why are you
doing this? We paid you.

885
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,399
It doesn't fucking matter.

886
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,949
You gave me enough bullshit
to lead you in here

887
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,059
and give me enough to bullshit to feed you

888
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,779
to take what I need to take.

889
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,053
Good luck, assholes.

890
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,969
Would you
say you're angry at Drew then,

891
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,989
for the three of you getting mugged?

892
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,749
Yeah, I was fucking angry.

893
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,749
So Drew was fully responsible
for this whole situation.

894
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,419
You're God damn right
he was responsible!

895
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,113
Hey, calm down, Mr Esper, okay?

896
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,229
Drew tried to keep positive.

897
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,789
He wanted us to keep going.

898
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,959
And you know what?

899
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,259
At that point I had played
mister good soldier.

900
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I had been happy go lucky
guy, but I was done, okay?

901
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,819
I was done, and his only response was,

902
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,799
hey, we'll figure it out.

903
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,279
We, we're good.

904
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,779
How are we good?

905
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,863
Do you have a history of anger problems?

906
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:19,563
Mm-hm.

907
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,570
I'm gonna get

908
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,903
a fucking fortune for this camera, shit.

909
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:39,538
Where the fuck am I?

910
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:40,539
Fuck.

911
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,757
Don't you even think you pussies can.

912
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:20,239
I have a knife, mother fuckers.

913
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,490
Don't thing I won't fuck
all three of you up.

914
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:26,274
Damn it.

915
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,370
Hey, the camera.

916
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:41,843
Why in the hell
would he leave the camera?

917
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:43,183
It's the only light.

918
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,740
Fuck.

919
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,176
At least we got something back.

920
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,090
Fuck.

921
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,499
By now, that fucking crack head

922
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,623
has probably run up God knows
what on my credit cards.

923
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,282
At least we got the camera
back. We got the light.

924
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:14,899
We know where the fuck
we're going now, right?

925
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,810
Come on, guys.

926
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:18,983
I'm covered in bat shit and mud.

927
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,949
I just want to go home.

928
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,930
Is that, is that too much to ask.

929
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:23,942
I just want to fucking go home.

930
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:24,807
Oh no, you can't even go home.

931
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,472
We gotta keep this fucking
thing going. The show has to,

932
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:28,199
we gotta keep the show going, okay, okay?

933
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,319
We're down here. We gotta,
shut the fuck up, please.

934
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,979
You just treat
this like a big fucking joke.

935
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,080
All right, so we're still in the sewers.

936
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,662
We got mugged, believe it or not.

937
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:41,473
We got followed by the
guy that led us down here.

938
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,703
But even though he did take the camera,

939
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,559
we ended up getting it back.

940
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,133
So, now we can see where we're going and,

941
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
yeah, we're gonna,

942
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,850
we're gonna keep on going.

943
00:42:59,933 --> 00:43:02,303
Which probably sounds
redundant at this point.

944
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:05,633
Are you done?

945
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,289
So you think that Ellefson's

946
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,889
gonna actually reimburse us
for all the shit we lost?

947
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,609
Well, at this point, he fucking better.

948
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,169
Speaking of which, why
Ellefson of all people?

949
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,889
Why is he doing a documentary
on homeless people?

950
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,779
Honestly, he's, this whole documentary

951
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,542
is a way for him to get
the Wall Street Journal

952
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,503
to write a fluff piece about him.

953
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
What?

954
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,933
Camera, is that a security camera?

955
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,353
Now what the fuck

956
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,330
would a security camera
be doing down here?

957
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,500
It's getting
real fucking eerie, man.

958
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:58,743
Let's, let's keep going.
Okay.

959
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:12,370
Holy!

960
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,370
Oh my fucking God.

961
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,789
Oh mother fucker.

962
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,849
How the fuck
do you explain this?

963
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,683
Oh, come on.

964
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:22,289
Is that a fucking tooth?

965
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,659
Can we just admit how
up this is now, Drew?

966
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,660
Can we go?

967
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:31,478
Mother fuck.

968
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,523
Is that open?

969
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,598
Look, hold on, hold on a second.

970
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,637
You hear that?

971
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,399
- Fuck dude.
- It's getting closer.

972
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,411
Aw Jesus fucking Christ!

973
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:15,026
Fuck me.

974
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:16,027
Oh God.

975
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:21,920
Oh!

976
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:23,398
They're watching.

977
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:28,399
What?

978
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:29,863
The water.

979
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:37,011
We gotta get outta here!

980
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:39,257
What the fuck was that?

981
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:41,379
Fuck!
Fuck was that?

982
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,459
Fuck.

983
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,710
Aw fuck, again?

984
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,119
Where's the fucking batteries?

985
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,129
Shit.

986
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,239
Doug.

987
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,599
Doug.

988
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,923
Doug.
Doug!

989
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,792
I'm here guys, I'm here.

990
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,626
I'm here, I'm here.

991
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,039
Do you have the batteries?

992
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,089
You're worried about batteries?

993
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,331
We can't fucking see.

994
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:00,866
I don't know what it was,

995
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:03,409
but I got blood all over me.

996
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,283
- Oh fuck!
- Jesus Christ!

997
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,810
Seriously, what the
fuck is going on down there?

998
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,239
So was this the point where
you guys all got separated?

999
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,619
Why won't you answer my question?

1000
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,370
Why won't you answer my question?

1001
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,313
Look, we were lost.

1002
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:27,913
We were exhausted.

1003
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,609
I had to defend myself for
days against those things.

1004
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,669
Don't you think you owe
me some information?

1005
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,913
I don't know you a thing, Mr Esper.

1006
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:39,319
Gonna ask you one more time.

1007
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,872
Is this when you became
separated from Drew and James?

1008
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:43,609
This is fucking bullshit, Dotani!

1009
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,059
Fucking bullshit!

1010
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,793
What am I even doing here?

1011
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,839
Well, we're
getting your story straight.

1012
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,489
It couldn't, the facts
couldn't be more straight.

1013
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,290
All over the place.

1014
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,983
All right, so,

1015
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,123
believe in monsters?

1016
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,630
Monsters?

1017
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,193
Mr Esper, do you believe in monsters?

1018
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,393
Everything they said was true.

1019
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,813
We all saw it.

1020
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,803
Worse, we heard it.

1021
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,710
The dragging,

1022
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:28,429
the scraping, the crying,

1023
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,773
the meowing, growling.

1024
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,009
I mean look, take your people
down there if you're so brave.

1025
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,689
Go in those sewers
yourself, see what you find.

1026
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,859
We've been in the sewers.
We do this day in and day out.

1027
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,653
There's no damn monster down there.

1028
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,519
Only in your imagination.

1029
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,043
It's a sewer for God sakes.

1030
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:54,599
You know what, you want answers?

1031
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,311
Upload the footage from those
security cameras down there.

1032
00:47:57,312 --> 00:47:58,145
What security cameras?

1033
00:47:58,146 --> 00:47:59,429
There's no security cameras down there.

1034
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,099
Yeah, there's a bunch of them.

1035
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,933
We saw them.

1036
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:03,243
We filmed one of them.

1037
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:05,949
There are no security cameras
in the sewers, Mr Esper.

1038
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,039
You've just had a
post-traumatic stress event.

1039
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,309
Your memory's a little foggy,
but there are no cameras.

1040
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,699
We're down there day in and day out,

1041
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,142
and I can assure you that there
are no cameras down there.

1042
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,069
No, no, you're wrong.

1043
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,093
Incredible, absolutely incredible.

1044
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,620
Can we start acknowledging

1045
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:30,059
how fucking up this is right now?

1046
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,209
Obviously people are
gonna start looking for us

1047
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,739
if they haven't already.

1048
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,551
But, they're not gonna know that we're,

1049
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:39,753
they're not gonna know to
look in the fucking sewer.

1050
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,993
If we find our way out of here,

1051
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,598
how much do you figure
I'm gonna sue you for?

1052
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,385
Oh, you still get,

1053
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:55,230
you're really gonna sue me, James?

1054
00:48:56,208 --> 00:49:00,546
Well it's, on the plus side for you,

1055
00:49:00,547 --> 00:49:02,139
the likelihood of us making
it out of here is pretty slim.

1056
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,443
So I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

1057
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:18,852
Man, I guess everything's true.

1058
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:21,919
Everything, everything those hobos said.

1059
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,319
There's, something is down here.

1060
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,583
There were sightings and,

1061
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,554
it harmed people, it hurt
people, it killed people.

1062
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:33,069
That, then that detective, you know,

1063
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,719
obviously he's trying to hide something

1064
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,729
because he tried to downplay everything.

1065
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,399
Heck he had an explanation
for everything, too.

1066
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,679
Look, at the end of
the day, we don't have shit.

1067
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,609
We know that we've seen
some really fucked up shit,

1068
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,979
but right now my only concern

1069
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,743
is getting the fuck outta here.

1070
00:49:49,963 --> 00:49:51,880
All right, know what?

1071
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:13,757
Whoa.
What?

1072
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,000
You guys,

1073
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:21,470
you guys hearing that?

1074
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:23,388
What is that?

1075
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:27,270
Oh shit, what is that?

1076
00:50:28,361 --> 00:50:29,194
What the?

1077
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,789
Calm the fuck down, asshole.

1078
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,590
You're in the same situation we are.

1079
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:35,399
Are you a dweller?

1080
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,219
Yeah, one of the first and
probably one of the last.

1081
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,529
What the fuck
is going on down here?

1082
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,463
They don't like the fucking light.

1083
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,079
It's the only thing that keeps
them the fuck away from you.

1084
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,759
Where the hell
did these things come from?

1085
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,759
All I know is that a while back,

1086
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,439
the EPA did their annual
probe of the sewers,

1087
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,999
which usually scares the
shit out of all of us.

1088
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,839
But this time it scared
the shit out of them.

1089
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,489
That's when all these security cameras

1090
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,149
started showing up in these tunnels.

1091
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,049
I've been trying to get
out of here for weeks now.

1092
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,549
And with my lights broken,

1093
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:11,763
if I run into one of these
things down here, I'm fucked.

1094
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,499
Well, let's try to wake
up tons of fun over here

1095
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,208
and get the out of here.

1096
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:19,582
Could you hold this for a second.

1097
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:20,772
Doug, come on.

1098
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:21,773
Get up.

1099
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:24,271
Come on, we gotta go.

1100
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,819
Hey man, you're good.

1101
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,652
Oh no no no, he's.

1102
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:34,183
Fuck!

1103
00:51:35,557 --> 00:51:37,890
Ripped his fucking head off!

1104
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,083
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1105
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,989
Where's Doug?

1106
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,193
Oh, mother fucker.

1107
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,999
This is completely fucked!

1108
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,450
Mother fucker, Doug.

1109
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,773
Oh God damn it, this is fucked!

1110
00:51:56,774 --> 00:51:57,666
Oh my God.

1111
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:58,990
Doug, Doug, Doug.

1112
00:51:58,991 --> 00:51:59,824
We gotta find Doug, man.

1113
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,809
Shut the fuck up.

1114
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,356
For once in your miserable
fucking life, shut the fuck up.

1115
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,929
No, no, shut up.

1116
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:11,549
You are without a doubt the most amateur,

1117
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,619
fucking pathetic filmmaker

1118
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,970
I've ever worked for in
my entire fucking life.

1119
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,429
It's because of you that I'm down here

1120
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,728
and that Doug's down here.

1121
00:52:21,729 --> 00:52:23,819
And Doug's fucking gone.

1122
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,429
He's fucking gone.

1123
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:30,430
So keep in mind, if Doug's
dead, that's on you.

1124
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,669
And if I fucking die, that's on you, too.

1125
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,516
James, I, James, I'm so sorry, dude.

1126
00:52:37,517 --> 00:52:39,959
I didn't, really, I didn't
mean to get us into this, man.

1127
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,193
Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up.

1128
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,799
James.

1129
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,250
Here's what we're gonna do.

1130
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,829
They said to follow the water, right?

1131
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,659
You heard him?
Yeah, yeah yeah.

1132
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,659
Well Doug heard 'em, too.

1133
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,793
So we follow the water and
hope that he does, too.

1134
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,183
Okay.

1135
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,893
All right, that sounds good.

1136
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:10,759
I mean, one thing though, James.

1137
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,760
What's that?

1138
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,723
I don't, I don't hear any water.

1139
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,560
Come on.

1140
00:53:26,396 --> 00:53:27,563
Doug.

1141
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:41,949
Doug.

1142
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:46,079
Doug.

1143
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,819
You sound like you're trying to warn him

1144
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,919
from beyond the grave.

1145
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,710
I don't think that's gonna help.

1146
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:56,842
Oh God.

1147
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,503
How would the
fuck you explain that?

1148
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,980
We're both seeing the
same thing here, right?

1149
00:54:08,272 --> 00:54:09,381
You know something, though?

1150
00:54:09,382 --> 00:54:11,219
What's that?

1151
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,459
We've been getting everything on camera.

1152
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,879
And most of the time,

1153
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,209
when people go through
metaphysical experiences like this,

1154
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,499
they don't even think to snap a picture,

1155
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,049
and when they do, it's just blurry.

1156
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,122
But we've been getting everything,

1157
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:26,372
and it belongs to us.

1158
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:28,343
It belongs to Ellefson Films.

1159
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,659
I think they're better
off getting somebody else,

1160
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,860
like they were gonna do.

1161
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,152
What are you talking about?

1162
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:37,129
It's nothing, man, really.

1163
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,609
No, it's something.

1164
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,960
I've known something was
up since you got here.

1165
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,530
All right.

1166
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,989
Remember when I showed up at
your house super early today?

1167
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,239
Yeah, this
morning, several hours ago.

1168
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,779
Yeah, how can I forget?

1169
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,439
Well, I'd just come from a meeting

1170
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,219
with Ellefson and Hazaert
a couple states away.

1171
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,299
And they informed me

1172
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,379
that because I hadn't fulfilled

1173
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,379
my contractual obligation for the project,

1174
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,989
that they were gonna take the money back,

1175
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,302
get somebody else to do it.

1176
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,869
Take me to court for breach of contract

1177
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:13,259
and pretty much tarnish my
reputation in more words or less.

1178
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,303
And so there's a lot on line here.

1179
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:18,570
What the fuck man?

1180
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,919
Well, at least they gave you the money

1181
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,913
to get us to make the job right, right?

1182
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,050
Not exactly.

1183
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,850
What do you mean, not exactly?

1184
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,207
Drew.

1185
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,208
Okay.

1186
00:55:38,242 --> 00:55:39,783
They don't know I bonused you out.

1187
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,270
That came out of my pocket.

1188
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,553
You're the only person I know

1189
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:46,709
that could have got this project done

1190
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,689
as quick as it needed to be done.

1191
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,940
And I, I didn't want to
show up empty handed.

1192
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,520
God damn it, man.

1193
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:56,649
If you had just come to
me and told me the truth,

1194
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,263
I would've done it for free.

1195
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,949
Seriously?

1196
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,379
Yeah, fucktard.

1197
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,330
Believe it or not, I'm not the
asshole that you think I am.

1198
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,010
You're a good man, James.

1199
00:56:11,547 --> 00:56:12,547
You really are.

1200
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,349
Oh, what is that?

1201
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,633
Don't tell me.

1202
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,339
Aw fuck.
Jesus, okay.

1203
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,820
- Again?
- Okay, okay.

1204
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:48,911
Hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

1205
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:50,719
Hold on, all right.

1206
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,620
Where's your batteries?

1207
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:56,107
I got 'em, I got 'em,
I got 'em.

1208
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,109
Oh shit, James.
It's in front of us.

1209
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,011
James, what do we do?

1210
00:57:03,012 --> 00:57:04,909
It's in
fucking front of us, man.

1211
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:06,469
What do we do, James?

1212
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,103
Get the battery out, now.

1213
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:10,062
Quietly.

1214
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:14,529
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1215
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,643
It's, fuck, it's getting closer.

1216
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:21,234
Get the fucking battery, man.

1217
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,152
It was right in front of us, I heard it.

1218
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:32,159
It's not here.

1219
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,373
It must really not like the light.

1220
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,812
We gotta move,
man. It's too fucking close.

1221
00:57:38,813 --> 00:57:41,132
All right.

1222
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:42,133
Let's.

1223
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:44,412
Come on.

1224
00:57:44,413 --> 00:57:46,255
Let's go, let's go.

1225
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,423
Let's go this way.
Okay.

1226
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:59,379
How can you possibly say
nothing's repeating itself,

1227
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,449
when everything looks the same down here?

1228
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,450
Everything!

1229
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,144
Let's go this way.

1230
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:48,889
Oh shit, James, daylight.

1231
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,240
Drew, Drew, wait.

1232
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:52,785
What is it?

1233
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:53,688
Turn the light off,

1234
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:55,855
turn the light off.
Okay.

1235
00:58:58,198 --> 00:59:02,919
Is it one of those things?
Yeah.

1236
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,819
It's gonna see you.

1237
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,373
No no no, it's okay,
it's about 20 feet up.

1238
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,443
What do you see?

1239
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,722
It's got itself pressed
up against the wall.

1240
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:16,723
Sewer drain.

1241
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:31,470
It's dressed like a hobo.

1242
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:35,929
I think these things
used to be the dwellers.

1243
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,080
Jesus Christ.

1244
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:43,147
We need to, fuck.
They can't see me.

1245
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:50,211
What is it doing?

1246
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,591
Meowing like a cat.

1247
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:54,662
Looks like it's meowing like a cat.

1248
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:55,996
A cat?

1249
00:59:57,124 --> 01:00:01,471
Hey whoa, I think
there's a black cat down there.

1250
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,472
Oh God.

1251
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:04,904
What's it doing now?

1252
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:06,703
It's luring someone in the sewer drain.

1253
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:12,263
There's a girl.

1254
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,970
Should we help her?

1255
01:00:21,943 --> 01:00:23,143
Drew.

1256
01:00:28,637 --> 01:00:31,315
We gotta, we don't have a choice.

1257
01:00:31,316 --> 01:00:33,972
We gotta keep on going.

1258
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:36,515
There's nothing we can do.

1259
01:00:36,516 --> 01:00:38,703
This is fucked.

1260
01:00:38,704 --> 01:00:41,787
Oh, he's starting to, reaching her.

1261
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,408
Come on.

1262
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,657
I can't see this.

1263
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:50,139
Come on.

1264
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:32,438
There's nothing we could do.

1265
01:01:34,595 --> 01:01:36,928
There's nothing we could do.

1266
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,157
How did you find your way out?

1267
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,710
The girl said follow the water.

1268
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,439
I stumbled around for hours.

1269
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,723
I couldn't find a single
drop, but I could hear it.

1270
01:01:57,846 --> 01:01:59,296
It was right behind the wall.

1271
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:03,299
So I followed the tunnel hours on end,

1272
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,423
stumbling in the dark.

1273
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,129
But then I started hearing those noises.

1274
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,130
The dragging.

1275
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,609
Like they were pulling
bodies down the tunnel.

1276
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,113
The crying babies, the meowing, the.

1277
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,360
That's when my light went out.

1278
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,969
I saw a crack in the wall.

1279
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,949
The noises got closer.

1280
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:30,439
I ran, I jumped through the crack.

1281
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,179
I fell into a strong current.

1282
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,433
It carried me right
out to a reservoir and,

1283
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,640
that's where the cops found me.

1284
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,633
And how long was it

1285
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,039
from the time you guys became separated

1286
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,340
till the time you got out?

1287
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,029
Several days, I think.

1288
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,899
I mean, how long were we missing for?

1289
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,679
All right, so you made it out safely.

1290
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,109
Did you feel any remorse whatsoever

1291
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,489
you left the other two behind?

1292
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:58,339
I didn't leave them behind.

1293
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,069
You could have gone back
to go find them, correct?

1294
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,979
I didn't know if they were alive.

1295
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,289
I didn't know if they were still in there.

1296
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,019
I got out, I was exhausted.

1297
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,109
I couldn't think straight.

1298
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,919
And all of the sudden there's
cops with these bright lights

1299
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,489
and they're asking me questions.

1300
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,773
I didn't know what to do.

1301
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,723
I didn't leave them behind.

1302
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,429
Okay.

1303
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,529
So really, this all points back at Drew.

1304
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,330
He was responsible for this
whole situation, was he not?

1305
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:27,303
Yes.

1306
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,309
And you're angry at him?

1307
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,709
You're damn right I am.

1308
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,543
Okay.

1309
01:03:30,544 --> 01:03:32,609
Drew put me in that situation.

1310
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:33,443
Yeah.

1311
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:35,779
- I trusted Drew.
- Absolutely.

1312
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,233
So taking this all in,

1313
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,429
see how it sounds a little silly

1314
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:41,330
you keep saying you saw some creature?

1315
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:48,099
That's the thing, I did
see a creature down there.

1316
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,559
Okay, but look, Mr Esper,
this is what happens.

1317
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,669
We talked about the memory fog, okay?

1318
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,059
You met all these homeless people.

1319
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,069
They sold you on this fairy
tale of a creature, okay?

1320
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,070
You got hit in the head.

1321
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:59,929
So basically now your mind
has filled in the blanks.

1322
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:01,260
You've convinced yourself
there's a creature.

1323
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:02,163
No no no.

1324
01:04:02,163 --> 01:04:02,996
- There's no creature.
- Watch the footage!

1325
01:04:02,997 --> 01:04:04,739
- I've seen the footage.
- Watch the footage!

1326
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,109
The fucking film.
We've seen the SD cards.

1327
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,863
There is no creature.
No, no.

1328
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,399
We were down there for hours.

1329
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,329
Ask James and Drew, they'll
back up everything I said.

1330
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,209
- Ask James and Drew?
- Yeah.

1331
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,043
Okay, you know what?

1332
01:04:20,044 --> 01:04:21,379
Let's just get to the
bottom of this right now.

1333
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,380
The whole reason we're having this talk.

1334
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,259
We found the remains of Drew Fortier

1335
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,060
and James Edwards about an hour ago.

1336
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,510
Wait.

1337
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,109
They're dead?

1338
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:39,000
You're acting surprised.

1339
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,789
You've known this entire
time that they're dead.

1340
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,829
Admit it.
What the hell is going on?

1341
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:43,929
I'll tell you what's going on.

1342
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,449
You've said it multiple times.

1343
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,659
You were angry at Drew.

1344
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,959
He's been taking advantage of you.

1345
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,259
He was paying the other guy.

1346
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,149
You have a history of anger problems.

1347
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,509
And eventually you got lost in a sewer.

1348
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:54,343
You flipped out.

1349
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:56,979
You killed him, James and
everybody else who was down there.

1350
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,259
And now you're trying to sell
me some damn monster story.

1351
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,260
Admit it!

1352
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,393
Admit it, you killed them, Mr Esper.

1353
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,479
I killed them?

1354
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,719
Yes, you killed them.

1355
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,029
Thank you for that.

1356
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:23,971
I killed them?

1357
01:05:23,972 --> 01:05:26,009
Hey guys, we got our
confession. Come take him away.

1358
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:26,843
I killed them?

1359
01:05:26,844 --> 01:05:28,118
Thank you, Mr Esper.

1360
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:29,404
I killed them?

1361
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:30,307
Yes.

1362
01:05:30,307 --> 01:05:31,207
I killed them?

1363
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:32,040
Yes you did.

1364
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:32,873
I killed them.

1365
01:05:32,873 --> 01:05:33,706
Yep, you did.

1366
01:05:33,707 --> 01:05:34,761
I killed them.

1367
01:05:34,762 --> 01:05:35,595
Thank you, Mr Esper.

1368
01:05:35,596 --> 01:05:37,273
I killed them.

1369
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:38,377
Done.

1370
01:05:38,378 --> 01:05:43,378
I killed them.

1371
01:05:53,395 --> 01:05:55,259
Everything hasn't
been going according to plan,

1372
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,433
obviously, but.

1373
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,879
You all right?

1374
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,713
I'm talking
to the fucking camera,

1375
01:06:01,713 --> 01:06:02,613
like I've been doing
all fucking day, James.

1376
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:04,429
Okay, well I stopped filming.

1377
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:05,959
What do you mean
you're not fucking shooting?

1378
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,033
I mean, we're out of SD cards.

1379
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:10,599
How long have
you been not shooting for?

1380
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,129
I at.

1381
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,883
Are you fucking
kidding me, James?

1382
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:15,193
I don't know what to tell you.

1383
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,659
Turn the camera on now.

1384
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,600
I can't shoot
without an SD card.

1385
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:20,649
Turn the fucking
camera on now, James!

1386
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,249
We don't have an SD card.

1387
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,439
You don't have any SD cards?

1388
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,763
No problem, here.

1389
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:30,359
I know Doug's missing and
that fucking sucks, okay?

1390
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,079
All right, but this had to happen.

1391
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,046
We're capturing some
incredible shit down here

1392
01:06:34,047 --> 01:06:37,845
and you should be proud to
be a part of this, okay?

1393
01:06:37,846 --> 01:06:38,748
All right.

1394
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:39,581
I should be
proud to be a part of this?

1395
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:40,549
Are you fucking kidding me.

1396
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:42,739
No, I don't give a fuck,
James. You're here, I'm here.

1397
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,093
We're in this together
right now, all right?

1398
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,529
And when I say capture everything,

1399
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:52,123
you capture fucking everything, okay?

1400
01:06:52,124 --> 01:06:54,333
Everything!

1401
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:59,083
Incompetent fucking piece of shit.

1402
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,429
You fucking lost it.

1403
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,713
You fucking lost it.

1404
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,960
All right.

1405
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,279
I'm incompetent?

1406
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,299
I'm, I'm not the one that
got us stuck down here,

1407
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,473
you stupid ass.

1408
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,043
James, I know, okay?

1409
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,299
At least we got the fucking camera light

1410
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,429
or else we'd be completely fucked.

1411
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:31,430
All right.

1412
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,129
We've been at this for like two days now.

1413
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,130
We need to.

1414
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:49,389
We're both tired.

1415
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:53,493
Yeah, can't physically go out anymore.

1416
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,900
Should we
start taking shifts or?

1417
01:07:57,835 --> 01:08:00,229
We got, we got two lights.

1418
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,708
You know, if we can make that work.

1419
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:04,629
We haven't been with in
a couple of hours, so.

1420
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,729
All right, I.

1421
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:07,650
Otherwise we're just gonna end up

1422
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:10,359
passing out of fucking exhaustion.

1423
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,260
I know we're exhausted, but,

1424
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,570
we're sitting ducks here.

1425
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,039
We won't be,
we won't be fucked with

1426
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,129
'cause we know it doesn't look like light.

1427
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,130
All right.

1428
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,179
Just watch my ass, man.

1429
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,160
This is, I don't know.

1430
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,290
James?

1431
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,530
Oh fuck.

1432
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:05,883
Oh God!

1433
01:12:05,884 --> 01:12:07,800
What the fuck was that?

1434
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:12,072
Oh James.

1435
01:12:12,073 --> 01:12:12,906
Oh fuck.

1436
01:12:12,906 --> 01:12:13,906
I am so sorry.

1437
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,483
James, fucking James.

1438
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,003
I'm all alone.

1439
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:34,330
Come on, man.

1440
01:12:37,302 --> 01:12:38,302
Jesus.

1441
01:12:57,597 --> 01:12:59,804
This had to happen.

1442
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:01,388
This had to happen.

1443
01:13:04,543 --> 01:13:05,999
I'm sorry to James and Doug's family,

1444
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,173
but this had to happen.

1445
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:13,084
I can see feel them
watching me all around me.

1446
01:13:18,275 --> 01:13:20,275
I can see one right now.

1447
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,888
Doug?

1448
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:33,195
Let's end this, come on.

1449
01:13:33,196 --> 01:13:34,696
I found a way out.

1450
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,700
Oh my God.

1451
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:41,104
Where you at?

1452
01:13:41,105 --> 01:13:45,022
Listen to the sound of
my voice, Drew, come on.

1453
01:13:45,859 --> 01:13:47,528
Doug?

1454
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:49,638
I can hear your
footsteps, Drew, you're close.

1455
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:51,250
Just keep coming towards me.

1456
01:13:56,387 --> 01:13:57,287
We got ya.

1457
01:13:57,288 --> 01:13:59,537
There's a light right here.

1458
01:14:00,557 --> 01:14:03,049
Little crack in the wall.

1459
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:05,240
Come right through, we got you.

1460
01:14:25,108 --> 01:14:27,191
Come on, Drew, reach out.

1461
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,549
Excellent work, investigator.

1462
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,383
No problem.

1463
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:11,002
The department will be
giving you full recognition.

1464
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:12,589
I don't need any recognition.

1465
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:13,739
Just doing my job, my man.

1466
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,039
But I'll tell you what.

1467
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,940
After this all, you gotta tell me now.

1468
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,730
What is going on in the sewers?

1469
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:24,779
That's why we needed you to
spin this around a little bit,

1470
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,159
to get a confession.

1471
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,759
See this whole thing,
if it waited any longer,

1472
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,399
could have been a massive
nightmare coverup for the agency.

1473
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,479
It's very political.

1474
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,789
We don't need to go into that.

1475
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:41,509
But, just know that the
situation in the sewers

1476
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,888
has been entirely contained.

1477
01:15:43,889 --> 01:15:45,939
And because of your work here,

1478
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,129
the media will be able
to twist this around

1479
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,829
in a way that we need them to,

1480
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:51,883
which is a tragic double homicide.

1481
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:57,459
No one really needs to know what happened

1482
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,933
down there in the sewers.

1483
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,209
And, no one needs to see
that footage, either.

1484
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,415
So we should probably turn that off.

1485
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:06,250
You know what?

1486
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:08,150
Yeah, let's go ahead and turn that off.
