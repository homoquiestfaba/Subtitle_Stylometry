What's up, Mom?

60
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,305
You're acting weird.

61
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,394
Your dad passed yesterday.

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,779

- Don't do that, Lucas.

everybody acts like they were
some saint or something.

66
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,125
You never had anything good
to say about him growing up.

67
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,586
Like, if we even
talked about him.

68
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:36,549
You know, when you were a kid, we
explained things to you in kid terms,

69
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,177
<i>but it's not
that black and white.</i>

70

to the story than you know.</i>

71

[Lucas]<i> Okay.</i>

72
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,229
How'd he die?

00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,984
Lung cancer.

74
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,409
Nice.

75
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,999
Your Uncle Tommy
went to the estate lawyer.

76
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,044
And, um, your dad
left everything to you.

77
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,964
Oh, my God,
the fucking deadbeat dude.

78
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,174
I don't want any of his stuff.

79
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,803
- Can you please just ask Uncle Tommy to take care of it?
- No.

80
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,388
All of the apartments
are in your name.

81
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,478

Hey, uh, I'm sorry to knock
so loud, Lucas,

97
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,684
but I didn't know
if you were in or not.

98
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,189
Yeah, I'm... I'm in. Sleeping.

99
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,650
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry... I'm sorry to wake you.
- Nah.

100
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,362
But I just thought that we
would get the day started.

101
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,782
Um...

102
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,368
Do you remember me at all, kid?

103
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,539
No, sorry.

104
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,333
Okay, I met you a few times
when you would come to visit

105
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,335
your father
when you were little.

106
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,337
I guess you were too young.

107
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,172
Yeah.

108
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,008
You still got
the same baby face.

109
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,844
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

110
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,513
Well, okay.
You know, enough reminiscing.

111
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,266
I just thought that,
you know, I would take you out,

112
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,852
we'd make the rounds and
introduce you to all the tenants.

113
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,146
- Yeah.
- I'm the groundskeeper slash superintendent.

114
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,565
Well, I kind of work better
alone, so...

115
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:12,028
- You work...
- Listen, I appreciate this whole "father figure,

116
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:17,700
help me out" thing,
but I'm good, thanks.

117
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,160
- You're good?
- Yeah.

118

Okay.
You know what?

119
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,622
I'll be around if you need me.

120
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:30,379
- See ya, kid.
- Oh, um, hey, what's the deal with me selling the place?

121
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,216
- In terms of what?
- Selling the place.

122
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,760
I want to sell the place.

123
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,721
Well...

124
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,141
first, you have to go through
all your father's stuff.

125
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,768
Make sense of it all.

126
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,062
Is there like a 30-day notice
I gotta give everyone?

127
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,189
All the tenants?

128
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,607
So they can go away?

129
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,651
Yeah, your pops,
he said you would be like this.

130
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,155
Haven't seen him in ten years.
Did he tell you that?

131
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,412
- I'll see you around, Baby Face.
- Hey, don't call me that.

132
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,414
That's... that's not my nickname.

Yeah, eh, eh, Cosmo says
you live here now.

Ah, no, I don't.

147

I mean, for now
I guess I do, but...

gonna set up some skate park
where that pool used to be.

151
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,984
Bro, don't listen to anything
Cosmo ever says in his life.

152
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,570
Four tres, blood.

153
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,157
Fuck Cosmo.
Eh, I want you to see something.

00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,372
- [both laughing]
- That's awesome.

157
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,125
They let your boy do the
graphics and everything on that.

158
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,253
- Yeah, I can tell.
- [both laughing]

159
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,921
Eh, you want one?
They gave me a bunch.

Yo, yo, yo.

161
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,634
You're the guy from Reno Rats.

162

I knew I recognized him.

166

174
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,575
[woman] Honestly didn't
take you to be a skater.

175
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,744
You seem more like
a rollerblader to me.

176
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,872
Well, I'm not either.

177
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:54,959
Then what's that?

178
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,631
Don't worry about it.

179
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,759
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

180
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,680
I was just...
I was just being a dick.

181
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,058
Teach me a trick.

182
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,311
Yeah, that's gonna be
a no from me, dawg.

183
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,938
You don't think I can skate
'cause I'm a girl?

184
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,649
- Is that what it is?
- No.

185
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,859
I just don't think
you can skate period.

186
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,653
Come on, just teach me.

187
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,781
Come on.
[chuckles]

188
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,286
[Lucas] Oh, boy, all right.

189
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,454
- [woman] I knew you would.
- Get on.

190
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:32,830
[woman] Okay, ready?

191
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,917
Pull me.

192
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,627
- Come on, pull me.
- No.

193
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,212
Pull me!
[laughs]

194
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,342
Faster.
Come on, pull me, bitch!

195
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,885
[laughs] Come on.

196
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,804
Come on! Faster!

197
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,265
Faster!
Okay, now let go, let go.

198
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,975
I'm doing it!
[laughs]

199
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,269
[squealing, grunts]

200
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,649
Uh, just keep it...
Keep it elevated.

201
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,776
I broke my wrist
a bunch of times.

202
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,361
- You just gotta, like...
- Can we please talk about something else?

203
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,989
Like, anything else.

204
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,325
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sorry.
- Thank you.

205
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,292
So, uh, what do you do for work?

206
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,963
I, um... I sell vintage.

207
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,173
- Sell vintage?
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,051
Yeah, like, I buy vintage
clothes and then I sell them.

209
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,138
Unless I really like them.
Then I keep 'em for myself.

210
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:36,143
So you basically shop for
yourself for a living, as a job?

211
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:38,437
[laughs]

212
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,065
Kind of, I guess.

213
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,066
That's cool.

214
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,110
That's awesome.

215
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,239
You know,
you don't have to stay here.

216
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,949
You can... you can leave.

217
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,327
I know.

218
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,705
- [crickets chirping]
- [dog barking]

219
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,458
[indistinct chatter]

220
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,755
[faucet handle squeaking]

221
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,806
Oh! What the fuck?

222
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,432
God damn it!

223
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,558
Ah, fuck!

224
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,519
Fuck, fuck me, Jesus!

225
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,109
Shit.

226
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,278
Help! Hey!

227
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,532
You have no experience
with plumbing,

228
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,576
but you thought you would just
go ahead and twist some valves?

229
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,163
All right, go ahead.

230
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,541
Twist the new valve, open it up.

231
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,921
- [valve handle squeaks]
- All right, now try the water.

232
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,092
[man] There you go!

233
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,635
See?

234
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,346
You really do work better alone.

235
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,598
Pretty much.

236
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,643
Ah, it's an old building.

237
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,187
Your father renovated it.

238
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,021
It still has its quirks.

239
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,527
Do you know that James Dean
lived up on the third floor?

240
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,237
For real?

241
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,030
No, I'm just fucking with ya.

242
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,618
Fuck you.

243
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,162
It's okay to ask for help...

244
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,373
sometimes.

245
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,423
[door opens, closes]

246
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,759
- [distant traffic hums]
- [birds chirping]

247
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,269
- Yo, what the fuck?
- Whoa, Jesus, I thought there was nobody here.

248
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:42,811
- Hey, man, hey.
- Hey! Hey!

249
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,646
Hey, wait! Whoa, whoa.

250
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,231
Hey. Hey, Lucas, it's me.

251
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,150
- Who the fuck are you?
- It's me. It's me.

252
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,485
Who?

253
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,653
You don't remember me?

254
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,573
- Uncle Tommy?
- Yes!

255
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,617
I thought you were gonna
kill me with that thing, man.

256
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,994
- You should knock next time.
- I... I just...

257
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,163
[chuckles]

258
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,998
It's me.
[chuckles]

259
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:06,627
- [light music playing]
- [no audible dialogue]

260
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,061
[Tommy] It's a nice
old building, you know.

261
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,730
I mean, no rent control.
[knocking]

262
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,564
- [man] Yo, come in.
- [Tommy] Hey, hey!

263
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,025
Hey, there he is!

264
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,529
- [grunts]
- [Tommy] How are ya?

265
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,906
- How are ya?
- Captain. [chuckling]

266
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,032
So...

267
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,201
What's new, Tom?

268
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,329
A lot.

269
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,248
A whole lot of shaking going on.

270
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,546
Sammy Stein, Luke.

271
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,967
This is the best of the best
of property law.

272
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,553
Ooh.

273
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,137
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,682
- How's it going?
- [chuckling]

275
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,434
Yeah, old Sammy here,

276
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,396
he got me out of a jam or two
back in the day.

277
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,191
- [Lucas] Yeah?
- Old IRS wanted to take everything from me.

278
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,320
The shirt off my back.

279
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,406
- In fact, every shirt.
- Fuck the IRS.

280
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,325
[men chuckling]

281
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,577
[Tommy laughing]
He always says that.

282
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,037
[Sammy grunts]

283
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,622
So, I just got off the phone
with the legal team

284
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,584
at Innovation Holdings,

285
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,502
and the offer
is still on the table.

286
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,130
Of course it is.
[chuckles]

287
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,424
You should have seen me
selling these people.

288
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,926
I was like fucking golden.

289
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,761
[Sammy] All right,
so here's the contract.

290
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,805
Now, I looked this over
and it's solid.

291
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,932
I mean,
this is a really good deal.

292
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,146
But all you need to do now
is you sign.

293
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,693
You... you wanted me
to sign it like right now?

294
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,239
Why the hell else
you think we're here?

295
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,577
You said you wanted
to sell, right?

296
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,335
- [waves crashing]
- [seagulls cawing]

297
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,300
[Kieffer] Hey, bro,
seriously, it doesn't matter

298
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,470
if it's a dude, if it's a chick,
if it's some kind of animal,

299
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,014
I don't know, just... I just wanna
see my bro get his pee-pee touched.

300
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,891
- Like, for real.
- [laughing]

301
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,018
- You know, like...
- What are you even talking about, bro?

302
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,854
- Like, I just wanna see you happy.
- [laughs]

303
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,314
For real, you come to LA,
you're all like moody and shit.

304
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,443
I don't know, like, I just...
I mean, for real, like...

305
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,653
Like, whatever happened
with you and Juliet?

306
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,990
He ended up calling. He's like,
"Good thing I brought my Heelys,"

307
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,867
and he just like slid away.

308
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,495
Nothing, that's what happened.

309
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,707
Yo, remember she was dating
Kev's dad back in high school for a bit?

310
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,459
What the...?
No, bro.

311
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,877
That was a fucking rumor.
That's not true.

312
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,714
No, no, no, dawg, I definitely saw
them making out at a party once.

313
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,007
Like, hard.

314
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,387
Thanks for telling me, dude.

315
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,306
Oh, shit, I'm...

316
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,058
I thought you guys
were on a break.

317
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:11,269
No.

318
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,189
Fuck Reno.

319
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,069
I wanna sell the place.

320
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,905
But...

321
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,700
I also...

322
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,703
don't wanna go back to Reno.

323
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,586
Then don't go back to Reno.
Damn, dude, I've been trying to tell,

324
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,173
like, Cosmo and all you boys
to move down here for years.

325
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,010
What the hell would
we have done in LA?

326
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,594
I don't know.

327
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,388
What the fuck
you been doing in Reno?

328
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,227
[Kieffer snickers]

329
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,399
[machine beeps]

330
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,319
Card declined.

331
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,156
You have a credit card?

332
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,033
Hey, Mom.

333
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,245
[Lucas]<i> This probably</i>
<i>isn't true or anything,</i>

334
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:13,248
but my mom had mentioned
there might be like,

335
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:17,169
uh, an amount or something I
could get monthly from the building.

336
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,423
It's probably
not even the case, right?

337
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,428
Is that what you really want,
kid?

338
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,429
Money?

339
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,391
- You wanna cash out on your dad's place?
- Uh, you know, never mind.

340
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,019
- Don't worry about it.
- No, Lucas, hold on.

341
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,271
I can't do it right now because
I have a water heater to fix.

342
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,107
But I'm happy
to chip you something.

343
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,944
But will you please
just go introduce yourself

344
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,946
to all the tenants first?

345
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,490
You know,
like a decent human being?

346
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,287
So be nice,
knock first and be polite.

347
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,459
You're a pain in my ass,
but thank you.

348
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,127
My name is Lucas and I'm
just going around the apartment,

349
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,296
introducing myself to everybody.

350
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:05,342
- No, I'm not falling for this bullshit.
- What?

351
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,971
[speaking in Spanish]

352
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,807
Yeah,<i> si, </i>yes.

353
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,230
<i>No hablo español.</i>

354
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,233
No.

355
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,902
Yeah.

356
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:26,321
Hi.

357
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,326
That's a...
That's a big responsibility.

358
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,203
- You up for it?
- Do you know how to do that?

359
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,831
I mean, you know,
manage an apartment?

360
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,666
- Oh, qualifications?
- Qualifications.

361
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,127
- You know, experience.
- For the building, like, to run buildings?

362
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,962
- Right, like...
- No, I don't.

363
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:42,921
- [speaking in Spanish]
- Um, no, no, no.

364
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,005
It's okay, thank you.

365
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,342
[speaking in Spanish]

366
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,386
No, no.

367
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,388
[Lucas]<i> I just came by</i>
<i>to introduce myself.</i>

368
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,431
<i>We're still figuring
everything out.</i>

369
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,058
<i>I'm just here to help.</i>

370
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,685
Hello.

371
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,187
- Hi...
- Uh, can you please just leave me alone?

372
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,191
Have some eggs.

373
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,818
They are good.

374
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,528
Oh, no, I... I'm good.

375
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,697
I have to go
around the apartments today.

376
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,198
You pig.

377
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,032
Where's the papers?

378
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,577
I don't speak English, so...

379
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,912
Yeah, you just spoke English,
though.

380
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,415
Oh, no, I... I never
spoke English in my life.

381
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,334
- Frank should come in with you...
- Um...

382
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,378
...because, you know,
I'm... I'm not feeling ya.

383
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,714
You know what,
I... I agree with you.

384
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,923
Oh, how about some chips?

385
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,551
Make you strong.

386
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,887
- Thank you.
- You come back to see me, won't you?

387
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,597
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

388
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,308
Ugh.

389
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,019
[tenant speaking in Spanish]

390
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,355
No sell. No sell.

391
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,400
- Get out of here!
- [doors slamming]

392
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,824
[knocks softly]

393
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,078
Hello?

394
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,043
Oh, hi.

395
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,921
Sorry, I didn't think
anyone was home.

396
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,131
No, I'm... I'm home.

397
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,342
- Yeah, sorry, sorry, I'm being weird.
- Yeah, you are.

398
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,553
I'm just going
around the apartment,

399
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,056
introducing myself to everyone,

400
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,352
and clearly I forgot it's you.

401
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:20,977
- It's me.
- Yeah.

402
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,270
- So, hello, again.
- Hi.

403
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,940
Well, even though
we've already met,

404
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,235
I am Miss Sophie.

405
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,444
It's a pleasure.

406
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,446
My God, that's so official.

407
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,323
Give me a handshake.
[chuckles]

408
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,991
The pleasure's all mine.

409
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,744
Lucas Varela at your service.

410
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,622
You're Augusto's son?

411
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,668
I can't believe that he's gone.

412
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,965
Yeah, it's weird. I feel like
everybody knew him except me.

413
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,508
And you're just taking over
the place?

414
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,803
No, no, I'm kind of like
watching over the place

415
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,846
until we figure things out.

416
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,973
Who's we?

417
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,057
Mm... me.

418
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,893
It's... it's me.

419
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,689
He, uh, kind of made me
like the head of his estate.

420
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,610
God, that sounds so British.
Um...

421
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,072
- It does.
- I don't know why he did that, to be honest.

422
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,951
Maybe it was his way
to show you he loved you.

423
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,705
Yeah, I don't know about that.

424
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,416
I think so.

425
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,965
So, uh, Tony Hawk,
how's your hand?

426
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,508
Maybe you can sign it
like in high school.

427
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:37,679
But just like maybe
don't draw a dick on it.

428
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,598
- Can't promise that.
- I'd rather you not. [laughs]

429
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,767
So, uh, are you like
an artist or something?

430
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,853
- What is all this shit?
- Mm, kind of.

431
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,940
I mean, I make things sometimes,
but my boyfriend, he's a DJ,

432
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:49,733
so all the music stuff is his.

433
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,736
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

434
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,364
I used to play in a band.

435
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,576
- Like, back in high school.
- Really?

436
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,454
I bet you guys
would get along really well.

437
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,371
- Yeah?
- You know what?

438
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,583
Gavin!
Gavin, baby, we have company.

439
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,252
- Come say hi.
- [Gavin] I'm trying to sleep.

440
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,046
What are you yelling about?

441
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,965
- Hey, bro.
- What's up?

442
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,759
[Gavin] Yeah, all right,
well, guess I'm up now.

443
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,554
- Mwah.
- I love you, poopy.

444
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,640
[Gavin] Mm, how do you guys
know each other?

445
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,810
[Sophie] Uh, Lucas
is Mr. Varela's son.

446
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,439
Mm, is that like a family friend
or something?

447
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,525
No, Augusto the... the landlord.

448
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,569
Oh, shit.

449
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,906
- Yeah.
- Oh, dude, I'm sorry, man.

450
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,406
God, I feel terrible.

451
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,617
That must be rough.

452
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,203
No worries.
Appreciate that, though.

453
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,081
Yeah, I... I didn't
put it together.

454
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,125
I've been texting him and he hasn't
hit me back about the garbage disposal.

455
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,961
It makes sense now.

456
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,130
By the way, could you tell
the janitor to fix it?

457
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,465
It's been broken for a while.

458
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,635
Yeah, yeah,
I can, uh, hit him up.

459
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,054
Appreciate it, bro.

460
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,680
It... it has been
really annoying.

461
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,519
Oh, baby, uh,
Lucas is from Vegas.

462
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,229
[Gavin] Fuck you!
No way!

463
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,647
I spend like six months
out of the year in Vegas.

464
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,734
I'm a DJ. I open up
for Tiesto at the Wynn.

465
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,693
I'm actually from Reno.

466
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,905
Oh, shit, fuck.
I'm sorry, I got them confused.

467
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,950
Nah, people get that mixed up
like all the time, so.

468
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,119
Okay.

469
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,662
Wait, so you're not from Vegas?

470
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,290
No, I'm from Reno.

471
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,710
Oh.

472
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,003
Well, why aren't you from Vegas?

473
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,131
Reno sucks.

474
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,718
[cars passing]

475
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,224
[distant horn honks]

476
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,893
[Frank] How about some whiskey,
Baby Face?

477
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,271
Grandpa likes to party, huh?

478
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,606
Grandpa thinks that
you can't hold your liquor

479
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,151
when you call a single glass
of whiskey partying.

480
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,361
Yeah. All right, I'll take
a double, then.

481
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,156
Ooh, bad boy.

482
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,784
Uncle Tommy came by
earlier today looking for you.

483
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,827
Oh, yeah?

484
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,496
Are you gonna call him back?

485
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,708
Just been kind of busy.

486
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,547
I heard that you met Mrs. Tuang.

487
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,341
She thought you were a Mormon.
[laughs]

488
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,887
She's been with us
since the 1980s.

489
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,847
Your pop has her rent locked.

490
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,516
She pays something crazy
like 500 a month

491
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,685
for her two-bedroom.

492
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,562
I don't know
how she would get by.

493
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,481
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

494
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,571
Why are you here, Lucas?

495
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,698
Well, I'm going around
the apartment,

496
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,367
introducing myself
to the tenants like you asked.

497
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,703
No. Why are you in Los Angeles?

498
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,959
You know why I'm here.

499
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:56,794
You didn't have to come.

500
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,382
I mean, I guess not.

501
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,762
Okay, I... I think
that you're here

502
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,265
because you wanna
make peace with your old man.

503
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,433
[Lucas laughs]

504
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,768
- Yeah, nah.
- No.

505
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:16,231
Maybe, maybe, a part of you

506
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,233
really cares about your father,

507
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,943
and you want
to make things right.

508
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,404
I think you're real off
on that one.

509
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,324
You know, most people
think that, uh, a man

510
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,577
is supposed to keep
everything bottled up inside.

511
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,996
But really it's much harder
to open up.

512
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,875
You read that on a poster
at an AA meeting?

513
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,210
Listen to me.

514
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,423
I'm putting up with you because I
promised your father that I would.

515
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,677
But if you keep fucking with me,

516
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,762
I won't hesitate to lay you out.

517
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:51,891
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,230
Apology accepted.

519
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,359
Ah, I was a lot like you
when I was your age.

520
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,239
Can I tell you something, Lucas?

521
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,074
[Lucas] Yeah.

522
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,582
Last year, uh...

523
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:21,879
my wife.

524
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,050
She was taken from me.

525
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,471
I felt...

526
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,435
I felt helpless.

527
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,356
But, you know,

528
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,401
a lot of people are going
through shit like you and me.

529
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,654
A lot worse, some of them.

530
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,077
Whenever you feel like talking,
you come over here,

531
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:53,911
we'll have a couple of beers,

532
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,249
we'll get some weight
off our chests.

533
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,086
How'd she die?

534
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,717
Just like your old man.

535
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,763
[sighing]

536
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,057
It's been a sad year
for me, Lucas.

537
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,938
Most mornings I just lay in bed.

538
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:26,319
I have to fight with myself
to struggle just to get up.

539
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:32,950
I mean...

540
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,498
why do you even get up?

541
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,503
'Cause I learned

542
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,713
how to appreciate
the small things in life.

543
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:50,510
Find meaning
in the small things.

544
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,807
You know, the taste of a
really good whiskey in a glass

545
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,310
with a big old fat ice cube
in it.

546
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:00,978
[exhales]

547
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,441
I know, it doesn't seem
like much to you,

548
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,903
but, man, sometimes...

549
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,073
it's all you're left with.

550
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,576
Yeah, no.

551
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,414
Actually, that sounds amazing.

552
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,127
It just, uh...

553
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,090
I don't know
how I'd ever do that.

554
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,224
You'll get there.

555
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,148
[Kieffer] For real, my ankle
was broken straight over.

556
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,607
- Like, done.
- That's gross.

557
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,942
[Kieffer] It was gross,
it was gross.

558
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,403
But like the pain
hadn't set in yet, right?

559
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:54,157
So I popped that back in, hopped back
on my board, tried the gap one more time.

560
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,368
I landed that, and then I
went straight in my homie's car

561
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,328
- to the hospital.
- [laughter]

562
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,081
That was your first clip
on<i> Thrasher.</i>

563
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,084
You were so darn cute.

564
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,002
[laughter]

565
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,920
But that ain't shit
compared to that crook

566
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,965
on that 16
that Lucas crushed up.

567
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,260
Damn, I'm telling you,
this boy was a skate god.

568
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,431
Was?
Emphasis on "was."

569
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,641
I saw this fool
try to skate the other day

570
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,810
and he was falling
all over the place.

571
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,021
- You were!
- [Lucas] Okay, wow, all right.

572
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,315
And whose wrist is broken
and whose is not?

573
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,649
That's because
you pushed me off.

574
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,859
- Oh!
- He pushed me off.

575
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,652
Eh, eh, no, no, no.
Go back.

576
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,321
You never said
that you were skating again.

577
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,406
I'm not.

578
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,996
Yo, you remember that time
Plug just like butt chugged

579
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,830
a 40-ounce
from the end of his board?

580
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,999
- No...
- [Sophie] Wait, why?

581
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,000
[Lucas]
Dude almost fucking died.

582
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,127
So, you get your pole wet?

583
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,256
Nah, we're just friends.

584
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,090
You know she likes you, right?

585
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,178
She's got a boyfriend.

586
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,679
So?

587
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,598
What the fuck does that mean?

588
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,559
Hey, Tara has a husband
and I still beat that up.

589
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,562
You're a fucking animal.

590
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,064
You know, and she's...

591
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,192
could be your mom,
you know that, right?

592
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,693
I do.

593
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,364
I fucking know that
and it's fucking awesome, bro.

594
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,700
Damn, 'cause she's like
a mom that you can fuck.

595
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,410
That doesn't sound right.

596
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,040
Oh, no! Oh...
No! What the fuck? No!

597
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,125
Dude, I'm not saying
I wanna fuck my mom.

598
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,711
No, I'm saying
she's like a mom you can fuck.

599
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,296
Yeah, dude I know,
I know, I get it.

600
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,714
It just doesn't sound right.

601
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,048
I understood
what you were saying.

602
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,346
[Lucas] I just want to see if
you had any like water leaks

603
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,098
or anything like that.

604
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,767
I'm in the apartment above
and there was just this pipe

605
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,893
that randomly exploded.

606
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,727
Wait, who are you?

607
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,106
Uh, I'm Augusto's son.

608
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,482
Yeah, but you're white.

609
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,735
Half white.
My mom is white.

610
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,029
Yeah, you're like 100% white.

611
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,240
Yeah, well, I guess
you just kind of turn out

612
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,786
looking like the parent
you actually spend time with.

613
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,497
So you just came down here to
take over his apartment complex?

614
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,291
No, it's not like that.
I would never live here.

615
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,627
I mean, if anything, I'll
probably just like sell the place.

616
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,422
You're gonna sell the place?
[scoffs] Great.

617
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,381
Go, go. Go, Ron.

618
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,925
Turn on the Craig's List alerts
for roommates

619
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,094
- because we will be homeless.
- Stephan, this is not helping.

620
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,679
I can't believe
this has happened!

621
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,974
Just go have a cigarette.
Calm down.

622
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,226
- Calm down.
- [Lucas] It's not for sure. It's not like it...

623
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,121
[Sophie laughs]

624
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,290
- You're fucking with me, right?
- I'm being serious, yeah.

625
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,292
It was that time
of the month for me

626
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,128
and all my friends told me
that it hurt to lose your virginity.

627
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:58,132
- So, it happened.
- How was that any better?

628
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,050
Don't judge me.
I see you judging me.

629
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,053
All right, Brown Town,
you do you.

630
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,138
[muffled music playing]

631
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,935
You want kids?

632
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:16,359
Mm, I don't even know
what I want, like, generally.

633
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,570
Yeah, I don't think anyone does.

634
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,240
And if they say they do,
then they're probably lying.

635
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,162
Do you want kids?

636
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,251
Is it fucked up
if I say I don't?

637
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,671
No.

638
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,756
- Really?
- No, not at all.

639
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,175
Yeah, I don't know.

640
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,974
I'll... yeah, I'll probably
have kids.

641
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,643
Yeah.

642
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,103
Sounds about right.

643
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,272
- What do you wanna name 'em?
- Hmm...

644
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,900
I don't know.

645
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,487
I haven't gotten that far.

646
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,781
I don't even want kids now, so.

647
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,701
What would you name your kids?

648
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,869
- [knocking]
- [lighter clicks]

649
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,871
I'm taking a huge shit!

650
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,999
[laughing quietly]

651
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,458
Thank you.

652
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,253
Thank you for coming
with me tonight.

653
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,382
For sure. Any time.

654
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,011
It's been really hard for me
to make friends here.

655
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,887
I mean, I have a million
and a half friends,

656
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,598
but tonight
was really fun for me.

657
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,402
Uh, you ever go to Vegas?

658
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,653
See Gavin's shows?

659
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,450
Uh, no, no, not anymore.

660
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,248
You ready to roll, Tony Hawk?

661
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,336
Yeah. [laughs]

662
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,672
- Ah... Oh, sure. [laughing]
- There you go.

663
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,718
Your back okay? We need to
get you some Viagra, stay strong?

664
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,012
[laughs] You're stronger
than I thought, kid.

665
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,431
- Shut up.
- You know, bed bugs are no joke, Lucas.

666
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,391
Listen, I bet you
a thousand bucks

667
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,852
if I asked you, "Hey, you
itchy right now?" you'd scratch.

668
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,021
Well, she's got a citation
from a pest control company.

669
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,606
Of course she does.

670
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,733
Pest control companies
bank on old ladies like that.

671
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,612
And even if she does,
how bad could it be, huh?

672
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,155
- [Lucas] Okay.
- [Mrs. Tuang] I told you.

673
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:30,076
- There are so many bugs.
- Okay, yeah, but the spray is to get rid of the bugs.

674
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,287
- You don't want the bugs, right?
- I don't want the bugs because...

675
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,290
- Okay.
- ...at night time when I sleep, I have to put tissue paper

676
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,792
in my ears and then wear a mask.

677
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,963
- Okay, can I look at the bugs?
- Uh, yeah, of course you can look at them.

678
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,632
- Okay.
- [clears throat] Yeah.

679
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,218
Oh.

680
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,385
- [wriggling]
- Oh, fuck!

681
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,639
Usually, night time,
they're everywhere.

682
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,810
I can even hear them
with my tissue paper in my ear.

683
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,562
And, oh, you know, even
their poo poo are very small.

684
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,816
But, oh, when there's a lot
of them, they stink a lot.

685
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,736
Okay, well, you need to clean
up your place, please, first of all.

686
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,947
- Seriously.
- I'm an old and sick woman.

687
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,365
- All right, okay.
- There's only so much I can do.

688
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,119
I hear ya. How long
ago did a person come

689
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,620
and check out your house
for bugs?

690
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,831
- How long has it been?
- Uh, I don't know.

691
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,415
I don't remember.

692
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,460
Your dad always
take care of it, yeah.

693
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:26,715
Mm.

694
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,051
[Lucas] I...

695
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,344
I'm sorry.

696
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:37,560
And I will call
the bug terminator people.

697
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,564
Oh, I love<i> The Terminator.</i>

698
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,482
Very good.

699
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:48,404
- How often does this happen?
- No,<i> The Terminator, </i>the movie!

700
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,407
Your dad showed me that one.

701
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,449
My dad showed you
<i>The Terminator?</i>

702
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah, he was helping me
study for my test

703
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:02,084
to become an American citizen.

704
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,211
We studied a lot.

705
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:10,384
He told me about
all the American heroes...

706
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,887
Benjamin Franklin...
[clears throat]

707
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,889
John F. Kennedy,

708
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,391
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
all those things.

709
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:20,269
Wait, Arnold Schwarzenegger
was on the US citizen test?

710
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,688
No, your dad and I,

711
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,275
we had American movie night
every month.

712
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,234
I really enjoyed that.

713
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:33,741
He, uh, brought a VHS
of<i> Terminator.</i>

714
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,244
Oh, I was so happy.

715
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,246
Hamburgers and everything.

716
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,959
I, uh, didn't know
he was so patriotic.

717
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:49,173
- That's weird.
- Well, he learned all these things with me.

718
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,841
Very supportive.

719
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,846
Yeah, he was an amazing man.

720
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,723
You know, it's just too bad.

721
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,352
You'll never get to know him
like that.

722
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,322
Tonight you become a man.

723
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,825
You watch this tonight, okay?

724
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,369
Okay.

725
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,955
[Sarah on TV]
<i>You're terminated, fucker.</i>

726
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,875

00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,423
[door opens]

728
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,968
- [Cosmo] What's up, bro?
- [door closes]

729
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,344
Cosmo?

730
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,055
What you doing here?

731
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,306
You have to guess.

732
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,725
Don't tell me you moved to LA.

733
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,852
I told Kieffer not to ruin
the surprise.

734
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,814
- Quit my job and everything.
- Wow.

735
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,649
Damn, you made the blankets
and everything for me.

736
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,360
Is it cool if I stay here
for a little while, bro?

737
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,487
Uh, that's me in there, so.

738
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,698
Well, why aren't you staying
in the regular room?

739
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,283
I don't know,
it's just been like...

740
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,201
I'm clearing out my dad's stuff,

741
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,579
and it's just been kind of
weird in there for me, you know?

742
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,414
That's tough.

743
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,708
Well, I guess
I'll stay in that room.

744
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,504
- Um...
- [motorcycle roaring]

745
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,427
[Lucas] Dude, you can't
ride that in here.

746
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,845
- [gunfire on TV]
- [Cosmo] I'm gonna be real here.

747
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,556
If I was a ghost, first thing
I'd do... girls' locker room.

748
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,268
What? What do you mean
the girls' locker room, bro?

749
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,396
- Like, how old are these girls?
- [Lucas] Yeah, what the fuck?

750
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,690
Like, college.
Volleyball age.

751
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,358
Volleyball age? Word?

752
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,402
- Okay, yeah.
- What age is that?

753
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,529
Lucas, just sleep
in your dad's room, man.

754
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:37,865
If he is a ghost, I guarantee
you he's not in there.

755
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,534
- He's in a girls' locker room.
- [laughter]

756
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,662
- [Kieffer] Dude!
- I don't know, man.

757
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,873
It's just kind of weird
being around him like that.

758
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,002
- Didn't even like the dude.
- Dude, your dad was the shit.

759
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,379
I mean, fuck, he took us
to every competition.

760
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,131
He let us eat
whatever we wanted.

761
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,008
- I smoked a joint with him once.
- What?

762
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,885
- No, you didn't.
- [Cosmo] No, seriously.

763
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,053
We went to go pick up
that truck.

764
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,097
- He totally let me hit a joint.
- Nah, you're full of shit.

765
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,475
You're full of shit right now.
You're just fucking with me.

766
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:08,645
- How old were you, huh?
- Damn, I wish I could've smoked a joint with your dad.

767
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,566
Yeah, me too.

768
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,027
That would have been tight.

769
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,537
What's up?

770
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,122
How are you?

771
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,083
Eh, fucking around.

772
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,167
What are you up to today?

773
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,086
I was supposed to go check out
my dad's beach spot,

774
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,128
clear it out.

775
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,506
Cool. Where?

776
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,091
San Luis Obispo.

777
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,260
You wanna come?

778
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,263
It's like three or four hours
away, you goof.

779
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,099
Ah, shit, all right.

780
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,100
Well, that's far.
Never mind.

781
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,268
Mm, you know what?

782
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,104
No, uh, I'll come.

783
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,399
You sure?

784
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,983
'Cause we probably wouldn't
get back till like midnight.

785
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,778
You know what, sometimes
you don't always need a plan.

786
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,322
Sometimes you just gotta
like let go and have fun.

787
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,449
- Live free, you know?
- Word.

788
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,284
You should open up
a yoga studio.

789
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,744
Are we taking the Mustang?

790
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,125
Uh, that's my dad's.

791
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,793
- I kind of feel weird driving it.
- Yes?

792
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,377
- All right.
- That's a yes.

793
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,004
Okay, I'm gonna go change.

It's okay to be weak sometimes.

What did he say?

I deleted it
before I could listen to it.

827
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:30,949
Why?

828
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,294
It just pisses me off knowing
that I had this moment to go...

829
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,340
Just to go off on him.

830
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,885
For how fucked up
he made me feel.

831
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,142
And just like ask him
why he left.

832
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,322
- I don't know.
- [cassette clatters softly]

833
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,705
Maybe I just wanted
to blow up on him

834
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,543
so that I had this
like second chance

835
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,046
to reconnect with him.

What do you think he said?

00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,570
Probably some corny dad shit.

Like, I can't remember the last
time I watched something on cable.

854

What? Cable's awesome.

- Do you like it?
- What, Reno?

861
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,263
Mm-hmm, yeah.

862
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,058
I don't know.

863
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,894
It's nice.

864
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,937
I mean, I hate it.

865
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:06,104
But it's nice.

866
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,985
Aren't there like mountains
and stuff there?

867
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,279
Do ever like go skiing
or snowboarding or...

868
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,823
anything like that?

869
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,992
Mm, nah, not really.

870
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,495
I used to go all the time
when I was a kid.

871
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,957
But I don't really go anymore.

872
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,503
It's like when something's
right there,

873
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,172
you take it for granted.

874
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:38,053
There's people like all over
that come to Reno for vacation.

875
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,971
Yeah, no, I get that.

876
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,474
It's kind of what it's like
in LA with the beaches.

877
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,309
Mm-hmm.

878
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,730
It's kind of fucked up
if you think about it.

879
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,732
I mean, why are we like that?

880
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,276
Why is that our default?

881
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,073
Guess it's just
our human nature.

882
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,701
Yeah.

883
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,832
- This show fucking sucks.
- What?

884
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,585
- It sucks.
<i>- Walker, Texas Ranger</i> fucking slaps.

885
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,463
- What are you talking about?
- You're ridiculous. [laughs]

886
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,924
I gotta pee.

887
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,718
Sick,
thanks for letting me know.

888
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,303
You're welcome.

889
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,098
[door closes]

890
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,730
You can tell me the truth
if it's a number two.

891
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,147
Shut up!

892
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,863
Oh, my God, they have those cute little
shampoo and conditioner bottles here.

893
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,365
You wanna take a shower?

894
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,998
Uh, we probably
shouldn't do that.

895
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,167
What are you talking about?

896
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,296
I meant...
Oh, I didn't mean together.

897
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,675
Okay, yep.

898
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,011
Sorry, um...

899
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,095
Duh.

900
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,099
Unless... unless you want to.

901
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,898
[light music playing]

902
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,859
[running water]

903
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,700
Eh, Sophie?

904
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,203
Still wanna go to that
Madonna Inn place for breakfast?

905
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,337
Eh, Sophie. Wanna get breakfast
at the Madonna Inn place?

906
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,922
Get out, Lucas.

907
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,884
- Are you okay?
- What... will you please get the fuck out, Lucas?!

908
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,861
[engine rattling]

909
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,533
[engine straining]

910
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,702
[Lucas sighs]

911
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,913
- Come on.
- [engine straining]

912
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,584
- [Tommy] It's one in a million that you meet someone like me.
- [Cosmo] Yeah.

913
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,880
[Tommy] I'm telling you because
I've met a lot of people here.

914
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,549
So you always close?

915
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,884
That's how I am, I close.

916
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,261
- So...
- I won't take no for an answer.

917
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:10,056
- Look at this, look at this, look at this.
- Hey.

918
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,893
- [door closes]
- What? What happened?

919
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,564
Uh, just kind of had
like a rough night,

920
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,315
so I'm probably gonna go to bed.

921
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,235
It's cool, man. We're just
gonna talk business in here.

922
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,906
Cool, um, can you
get off my bed?

923
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,076
- This... this is your bed?
- Yeah.

924
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:36,332
Uh, but you do know
that there is a bedroom, right?

925
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,417
- And...
- I know... I fucking...

926
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,586
- Can you please just...
- Is it because of your dad?

927
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,964
- Is it because he slept in there?
- No, no, it's not...

928
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:46,301
- I just need some space. Can you please get up?
- All right, all right, okay.

929
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:50,597
Let's... listen, don't...
Just, please, let me...

930
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,932
Give me five minutes.
We gotta finish this thing.

931
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,477
Luke, this is big.
All right?

932
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,395
You could be done with this.

933
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,105
So just give me a number, okay?

934
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,901
Couple days, a week, two weeks?

935
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,486
- Yeah, two weeks.
- Two weeks? Ah!

936
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,237
- That's fine. Thank you.
- All right.

937
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,739
That, I can work with.

938
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,867
[waves crashing]

939
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,380
Oil's clean.

940
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,887
Coolant's good. You know what,
put the cable back on the distributor

941
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,222
that's heating the coil.

942
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,682
- [Lucas] Right here, right?
- Yeah.

943
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,519
- [Lucas] Yeah, all right.
- Yeah, make sure it's tight.

944
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:40,146
- [Lucas] How about that, huh?
- Good.

945
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,648
Good job, kid.

946
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,857
Marine tattoo?

947
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,776
Yeah, yeah.

948
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,195
I served my country.

949
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,197
I was in the Marines.

950
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,657
Thought it was a jail tat
at first.

951
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,575
No.

952
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,957
- Ever been to jail?
- [chuckles] No.

953
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,458
No, I've done some dumb things
when I was a kid,

954
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,336
but I was never dumb enough
to get caught.

955
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,839
You?

956
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,132
Once.

957
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,970
Yeah, painted a dick
on a dumpster once.

958
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,429
- [laughs]
- In middle school.

959
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,890
Yeah, principal called the cops.

960
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,976
Like, just to scare us and shit.

961
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,645
And they actually
fucking arrested us.

962
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,563
It's so stupid.

963
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,356
Kind of funny
thinking back on it, though.

964
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:28,361
Wow, that's, uh...
That sounds dumb.

965
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:30,738
I bet your mom didn't think
that was too funny, huh?

966
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,615
I don't even know
if she found out, to be honest.

967
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,075
They called my dad.

968
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,787
I think that was like
the last conversation,

969
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,665
like real conversation
I had with him.

970
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,168
It's amazing.

971
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,548
To think that some of the most
important moments in our life...

972
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,385
they don't seem important
at the time.

973
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:59,601
What was the last conversation
you had with him?

974
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,685
Well, it was right down here.

975
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:04,230
Your dad was sitting over there
on that dumpy chair.

976
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,774
He was smoking a joint
and he was laughing.

977
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,445
He was interviewing me
on this little recorder device.

978
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,572
Pretending he was like
Larry King or something.

979
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,282
- [laughs]
- Did he do a good impression?

980
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,409
No, no, no,
that's why it was funny.

981
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:19,078
[laughs]
Look, your dad...

982
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,582
your dad had this quality
about him, Lucas.

983
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,668
You never knew
what he was gonna do next,

984
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,922
but you always wanted
to stick around to find out.

985
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,466
It was magic,
just like this positive force.

986
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,971
I guess I didn't
get that from him.

987
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:37,639
Oh, yeah, you did.

988
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,349
[laughs]

989
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,268
Your dad would show me
these VHS tapes

990
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,646
of you skateboarding
when you were a kid.

991
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,106
You never shut the hell up.

992
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,483
[laughing]

993
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,946
I don't know, man, it's like...

994
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,116
I hate to say it, but, uh...

995
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,829
the more I hear about him,
the cooler he sounds.

996
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,668
Kind of makes it worse
that he had, uh...

997
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,128
no reason to be around me.

998
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,508
Sometimes what a man
wants to do,

999
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,471
and what a man is able to do
are two different things.

1000
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:29,107
- Yeah.
- Just remember that next time before you judge the man.

1001
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,656
- [vendor] Tamales!
- [bell ringing]

1002
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,537
- Tamales!
- [bell ringing]

1003
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,793
- [bell ringing]
- Tamales!

1004
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:52,005
- [Lucas] Ugh, really?
- [bell ringing]

1005
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,512
- [vendor] Tamale, tamale, tamale!
- [bell ringing]

1006
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,100
[Lucas]
God, dude, fuck LA.

1007
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,395
[distant siren wailing]

1008
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,815
- [mailbox rattling]
- [Lucas] God damn it.

1009
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,152
[footsteps approaching]

1010
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,451
Yo, yo, need a hand?

1011
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,036
Uh, I'm good.

1012
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,163
I appreciate it, though.

1013
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,707
Aw, come on,
I got you, big dawg.

1014
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,377
Like these things?

1015
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,256
Not really, I just didn't have
any food at my place.

1016
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,218
You know who loves these things?

1017
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:43,681
Who?

1018
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,268
Sophie.

1019
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,394
Yeah.

1020
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,938
Yeah, she's obsessed.

1021
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:51,981
Yeah, last year
for her birthday,

1022
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,484
I got the tamale guy
to do a special appearance.

1023
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,361
He wore the sombrero,
the whole thing.

1024
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,446
Oh, she fucking loved it.

1025
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,406
- Yeah. That's... that's cool.
- Yeah.

1026
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,283
Yeah, it was cool.

1027
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,202
You know, I like to make her
happy, I like to see her smile.

1028
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:07,789
- She's a good girl.
- Yeah.

1029
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:11,667
Girls, you know, sometimes it
just takes the simplest little thing.

1030
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,795
Oh, dude, the other night,
I was DJ-ing...

1031
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,589
I'm a DJ... I was DJ-ing
the other night at UCLA,

1032
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:18,800
and this sorority girl
tried to suck my dick on stage.

1033
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,053
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1034
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:22,804
No, I'm lying.
Yeah, dude.

1035
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,806
I mean, I didn't do it,
of course.

1036
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,599
I don't cheat on my girl.

1037
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:29,310
I'm not... I'm not a fucking
piece of shit, you know.

1038
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,729
- Yeah.
- But I could have.

1039
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,481
And I could have cheated on
her a lot of times, but I don't do it.

1040
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,192
- Mm.
- Yeah, it's just bad karma.

1041
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,443
I don't...

1042
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,820
It's just not...
You know what I mean?

1043
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,154
- It's just not cool.
- Yeah.

1044
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,280
Yeah. So...

1045
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,866
- Do you mind?
- Hmm?

1046
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,951
- Can I have a bite?
- Sure.

1047
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,495
Yeah, my man.

1048
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,497
Haven't had one of
these bangers in a minute.

1049
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,876
Oh, my God, this is the best!

1050
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,129
Mm! Anyway, here.

1051
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,551
Oh, and by the way,

1052
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,136
I know what's happening.

1053
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,267
Yeah, that key
is for the apartment door

1054
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,685
and not the mailbox.

1055
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,854
You'll figure it out, homie.

1056
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,690

- Hmm?
- Nice pants.

Oh.

1063
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,178
I mean, they're just black.

1064
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:45,803
Yeah, but they're cute.

1065
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:51,184

- Guala Boy?
- What you know about Guala?

1068
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,858
- We grew up together.
- No way.

1069
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,319
So, a white nigga's talking
about Guala Boy.

1070
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:02,695
Yeah, is he here?

1071

Bro, you ain't seen
his Snapchat?

This nigga's out here
skating at P. Diddy's house.

1073

Naked bitches and shit,

- P. Diddy right there.
- [man] Ladies.

- What?
- Ralphs.

1079
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:30,014
I work at the deli at Ralphs.

1080
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,558
Oh, uh, uh...

1081
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,936

It's not you.

1088

You're gay?

1089
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:54,580
Yeah, sure.

I'm good.

1111

on my mind.

God damn it.

1117
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,910
You're looking like
you're about to sink one in

1118
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:38,953
on the field over there,
big dawg.

1119
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:44,834
- Huh?
- You look like a lacrosse player with that thing.

1120
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:45,042
Oh.

1121
01:06:47,002 --> 01:06:49,380
Uh, you play?

1122
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,632
Lacrosse?
Nah, man.

1123
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:52,425
That always seemed
kind of gay to me.

1124
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,136
No offense.

1125
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:59,223
- Well, I don't... I don't play lacrosse, so.
- Yeah.

1126
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:02,184
Well, I'm out here just trying
to get after it, you know?

1127
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,229
Never thought I'd be
one of those kind of guys

1128
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,440
to get fit
just for my wedding photo,

1129
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,691
but here I am.

1130
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:11,110
I'm that guy now, you know?

1131
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,403
Hmm.

1132
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,449
You, uh, guys going
to a wedding, or...?

1133
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,825
No time like the present.

1134
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,076
Show him the ring I got, babe.

1135
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,456
It's a long time coming.

1136
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,586
Speak now or forever

1137
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,006
[Gavin] We're actually having
an engagement party tonight

[Lucas]
<i>Don't even try it.</i>

1140
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,636
Don't even try
and convince me not to

1141
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:43,309
because I am so, so far past

1142
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,894
having made my decision.

1143
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,061
I'm selling the place.

1144
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,690
Well, I would say
congratulations

1145
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,651
on making a decision,

1146
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,988
but you're on the fence,
Lucas, I can tell.

1147
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:57,114
No, I'm not.

1148
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:57,782
You're fucking up, Baby Face.

1149
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,367
You're coming from a bad place.

1150
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,994
This isn't my mess.

1151
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:09,293
All right? I don't wanna babysit
this apartment till the day I die.

1152
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,797
I'm not happy here, man.

1153
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,089
You're not happy here.

1154
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,676
You're not happy in Reno.

1155
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,679
You're not happy
anywhere, Lucas.

1156
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,016
It's you.
You're not happy.

1157
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:27,520
No matter where you are
because it's in here

1158
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,522
and it's in here.

1159
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,399
Yeah, like you know best?

1160
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,736
The guy working
in this pile of shit

1161
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,280
for some dead asshole.

1162
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:41,700
That's the problem
with kids nowadays.

1163
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,662
You just want everything easy.

1164
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,457
Avoiding discomfort
the second you feel it.

1165
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,506
Bet you haven't gone through
your father's stuff yet, huh?

1166
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,051
Oh, God forbid, Lucas.

1167
01:08:59,134 --> 01:09:02,638
God forbid that you find something
that reminds you of your dad.

1168
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:05,891
- I'm sorry, but fuck him.
- He loved you, Lucas.

1169
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,143
You... You were
everything to him.

1170
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,149
Yeah.

1171
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,111
Loved me enough
to show his face.

1172
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:21,949
There's two sides
to every story.

1173
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,327
And it looks like
you've only heard one.

1174
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,915
What the fuck does that mean?

1175
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:34,253
Your dad went to Reno
to see you a lot.

1176
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:38,215
And your mom called the cops
on him every time he went.

1177
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:41,510
He spent a night in jail
just trying to see his son.

1178
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,306
Your mother, Lucas, she used you

1179
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,100
as a bargaining chip
in their divorce.

1180
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:50,644
Your dad, he smoked
a little bit of pot,

1181
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,898
but your mom, she wanted
full custody to move on clean.

1182
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:01,322
Then why am I being
told this now?

1183
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,119
Fifteen fucking years later,

1184
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,121
- you're telling me this fucking now?
- [object crashes]

1185
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:12,374
It doesn't fucking matter!
He's dead!

1186
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,297
I needed him ten years ago.

1187
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:21,842
And where the fuck is...

1188
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,387
Fuck, dude!

1189
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,723
Why am I fucking...

1190
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:32,394
even fucking angry
about this shit, dude?

1191
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,229
- It's okay to be angry, Lucas.
- It's not!

1192
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,148
It's not fucking okay!

1193
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:38,567
It's not okay that he did that!

1194
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,320
You wanna shoot the messenger,
Lucas, go ahead.

1195
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,200
But like I told you, there's
two sides to every story,

1196
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,242
and you don't really know
your dad.

1197
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,372

01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,081
- That's your friend with the dead dad.
- Yeah.

1203
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,125
- What's his name again?
- Lucas.

1204
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,168
Whoa! Whoa!

1205
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,753
What are you doing, dude?

1206
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,296
- You don't deserve her.
- Hey!

1207
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,007
[man] Okay, no, no,
Gavin, don't take...

1208
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,426
- Hey, watch out.
- Oh, you wanna fight?

1209
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:46,927
You wanna...
Come on, hit me, do it.

1210
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,887
- [all shouting]
- Oh, shit!

1211
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,100
Lucas!

1212
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,148
[thunder rumbling]

1213
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,232
[gunfire on TV]

1214
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:03,986
Have you guys seen my lighter?

1215
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,738
- [gunfire continues]
- [game controllers clicking]

1216
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,073
[Kieffer laughing]

1217
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,951
[Kieffer] Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

1218
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,954
- [Cosmo] Yo, you're blocking the view.
- Dude, just fucking turn it off!

1219
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,622
Turn it off for a second!

1220
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,376
I'm done, dude.
I'm fucking done.

1221
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,962
I'm selling this place.
Fuck LA.

1222
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,255
What?

1223
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:25,090
[Lucas]
I'm selling the apartments.

1224
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,968
- To who?
- [Lucas] I don't give a shit.

1225
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:30,512
I don't know, anybody.

1226
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,556
My Uncle Tommy's
got some people lined up.

1227
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:34,224
I don't fucking know.

1228
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,602
- Is this about that chick?
- [Lucas] No, it's not about...

1229
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,937
You guys seemed super happy
last time we hung out.

1230
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,314
God, no it's not
about the fucking chick.

1231
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:49,448
I mean, like,
maybe part of it is.

1232
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,953
- [sighs]
- A'ight. Yo.

1233
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,289
This stays between us.

1234
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,586
The last year
I almost quit the team.

1235
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:05,297
Can we just not talk about
skateboarding for like two seconds?

1236
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,801
- It's a metaphor, Lucas.
- Oh, God.

1237
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,969
Hey, just listen.

1238
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:14,431
I put so much pressure
on myself.

1239
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:18,977
You know, like, just...
It adds up, bro.

1240
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,646
Like, it just becomes too much.

1241
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,398
It's not fun anymore.

1242
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:24,399
Yeah.

1243
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,362
Yeah, so I just peaced out.

1244
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:31,365
You know, I didn't even tell
anybody where I was going.

1245
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:33,784
I just bounced out of town
for like three weeks.

1246
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,119
Didn't even take my phone.

1247
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,455
But when I came back,
everything was fine.

1248
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:43,210
Damn, you didn't even invite me.

1249
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:47,631
Hey, all I'm saying is sometimes

1250
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,425
you just gotta like
take a step back.

1251
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,137
For real, Lucas.

1252
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,471
[Lucas] Mm.

1253
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,348
Oh, shit, eh.

1254
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:57,850
You're the type of dude
who'll kill at whatever you do.

1255
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,352
[chuckles]

1256
01:14:00,435 --> 01:14:02,271
Unless it's being a landlord.
Then you're fucked.

1257
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,439
[all laugh]

1258
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,359
[light music playing]

1259
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:02,664
[Jane on phone]
<i>Hey, you're up early.</i>

1260
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:08,086
Um, yeah.

1261
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,714
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1262
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:13,217
I mean...

1263
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,680
no, I'm not.

1264
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,559
<i>You're safe, though,
right now, right?</i>

1265
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,355
Yeah, I'm safe.

1266
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,365
Mom...

1267
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,579
I know you kept him from me.

1268
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:58,262
I should have let your father
see you more.

1269
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,765
I'm so sorry, honey.

1270
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:05,769
I messed up.

1271
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:07,604
I messed up bad.

1272
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,234
I was trying to protect you,
but I ended up hurting you more

1273
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,569
by not letting him see you.

1274
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,076
[sighs]

1275
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,288
Your dad...

1276
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,708
total idiot.

1277
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,671
But he cared about you.
He did.

1278
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,597
<i>Parents, we're... we're just
kids who somehow got old.</i>

1279
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:10,709
Where do we go from here?

1280
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,420
- [water stops]
- [Lucas] What the fuck, dude?

1281
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:15,255
- I'm naked, get out.
- Well, come on.

1282
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,923
What are you doing?

1283
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:20,218
The buyers, man, the buyers,
they pulled out.

1284
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,639
Look, Uncle Tommy, at first I really
appreciated you helping me out...

1285
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:28,352
but it's starting to seem
pretty obvious

1286
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,438
you're like desperate for money.

1287
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,734
I mean, what's up, man?

1288
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,695
I'm in a lot of debt.

1289
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,575
I don't even know how I'm gonna
make this month's mortgages.

1290
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:46,995
I have no idea.

1291
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:48,622
I was counting...

1292
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,251
Forget it.

1293
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,798
Maybe I can lend you some money
from the apartments.

1294
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:02,552
Till you get on your feet.

1295
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:03,845
Would that help?

1296
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,100
Huh?

1297
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,644
Yes, yes.

1298
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:12,187
That would be great.

1299
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,940
And, I mean...

1300
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,692
there's also like 30,000
for the car

1301
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:21,071
and, uh, 10,000 for the boat.

1302
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:23,657
Yeah, I can't do that, man.
I'm sorry.

1303
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,662
You're a good man, Lucas.

1304
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,793
Being an adult sucks.

1305
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,503
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

1306
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:40,674
It's, uh... it does blow.

1307
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,052
Hey, look, I don't wanna
start any shit.

1308
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,680
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1309
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,311
Okay.

1310
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,819
Come with me.

1311
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,821
What?

1312
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,156
No. Where?

1313
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,700
It'll be like our version
of<i> The Graduate.</i>

1314
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,706
I'm getting married in ten days.

1315
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:16,001
Ah, yeah,
it's gonna take awhile.

1316
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,003
Probably should just like
call the whole thing off.

1317
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:18,712
It's not funny, Lucas.

1318
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,257
I can't go with you.

1319
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,053
I mean, of course you can.

1320
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,768
But you don't want to.

1321
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,187
And that's what I came here
to find out.

1322
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,565
Part of me
really wants to, but I...

1323
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:40,775
I won't.

1324
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:46,156
Whatever happened
to the whole "live free,

1325
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,116
follow your dreams,
artist girl" shit, huh?

1326
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,411
Maybe I was just full of shit.

1327
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:54,789
Maybe I am just full of shit.

1328
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,795
You are so intense, Lucas.

1329
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,883
And I... I thought...

1330
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,553
I thought I knew
what I wanted, but I just...

1331
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,849
I don't.

1332
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:15,936
Look, the only reason you think
everything's fine all of the time

1333
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:20,106
is because he doesn't think
about anything in a real way, ever.

1334
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,568
It's just like
some bullshit illusion.

1335
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:30,492
Maybe I'd rather live in some
bullshit, comfortable illusion

1336
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:31,868
than some dark version
of reality.

1337
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,248
Did you ever think about that?

1338
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:41,169
I know that you think
that I'm your answer,

1339
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:43,922
but I'm... I'm not.

1340
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:50,220
You know that whole thing
that, like,

1341
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:53,807
"you can't love somebody
unless you love yourself" thing?

1342
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,147
I mean, it's bullshit.

1343
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:10,115
Being there for somebody else
when you're down,

1344
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:10,907
that's fucking real love.

1345
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,873
So, why'd you go
on that road trip with me?

1346
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:25,922
I needed it.

1347
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,262
Just... something different.

1348
01:21:36,099 --> 01:21:38,476
And you seemed like
a lot of fun.

1349
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:41,855
Well...

1350
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:44,858
surprise.

1351
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:49,904
Yeah.

1352
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:55,243
[light music playing]

1353
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,846
[no audible dialogue]

1354
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:39,996
[Lucas]<i> I can't do it.</i>

1355
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,253
Alone.

1356
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,257
I'm... I'm keeping
the apartments,

1357
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,301
but, uh, I can't do it
without you.

1358
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,845
What's this?

1359
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,849
[chuckles] You know that this
doesn't legally bind anything.

1360
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:00,934
Yeah, I know.

1361
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:03,311
It's more of a symbolic thing.

1362
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,729
I was gonna ask
Uncle Tommy to help me

1363
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,607
with his lawyer
create something,

1364
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,568
but I'm pretty sure he's one of
those legal shield scam artists, so.

1365
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,696
[laughs] Yeah.

1366
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:16,741
I know, it was, uh,
the best I could do.

1367
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,244
I'll see you around, Frank.

1368
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,746
Hey, Baby Face.

1369
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,376
Be well, my friend.

01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:06,332
<i>when did I get so old?</i>

1374
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:13,131
<i>I don't know if you're ever
really ready to die,</i>

1375
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:18,261
<i>but, uh, maybe that means
you've always been ready to die.</i>

1376
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:24,642
<i>Anyways, I wish
things were different.</i>

1377
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:28,897
<i>I just wish we had
a chance to just...</i>

1378
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:32,650
<i>hang out more, you know?</i>

1379
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:39,324
<i>I used to worry about you.</i>

1380
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,451
<i>A lot.</i>

1381
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:45,246
<i>But, uh, honestly,</i>

1382
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,165
<i>I'm not worried
about you, Lucas.</i>

1383
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,709
<i>You always had a drive
for something more,</i>

1384
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:53,713
<i>and I think that's a gift.</i>

1385
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:58,176
<i>Just don't be so hard
on yourself all the time.</i>

1386
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:02,347
<i>Jesus Christ,
you drove us crazy.</i>

1387
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,933
[chuckles]<i> Locking yourself up</i>
<i>in the skate park bathroom.</i>

1388
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:11,272
<i>But life or death
isn't life either.</i>

1389
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,027
<i>I think you get that
from your mom.</i>

1390
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:21,533
<i>She's driven by
the what-ifs of the world.</i>

1391
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,411
<i>The only way I know
how to operate</i>

1392
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,498
<i>is by the what-is.</i>

1393
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:31,709
[light music playing]

1394
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:34,546
<i>I don't blame her, though.</i>

1395
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:38,758
<i>I do have to give her
some major props.</i>

1396
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,718
<i>Jane...</i>

1397
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,887
<i>now that's a woman.</i>

1398
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:47,725
<i>Deep down, a real, tough bitch.</i>

1399
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:54,482
<i>In the most loving and amazingly
unapologetic way possible.</i>

1400
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,735
<i>She did what she had to do
to take care of you.</i>

1401
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:01,114
<i>I respect her for that.</i>

1402
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:04,534
<i>I think I always played</i>

1403
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:07,996
<i>the good cop to her bad cop.</i>

1404
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,914
<i>And it wasn't fair to her.</i>

1405
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,250
<i>She got fed up with it.</i>

1406
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,252
<i>Things changed.</i>

1407
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,295
<i>I let it happen.</i>

1408
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:20,967
<i>I just wish I... I knew
how to tell you that.</i>

1409
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,805
<i>So, um...</i>

1410
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:28,892
[clicks tongue, sighs]

1411
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:30,727
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1412
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,192
<i>You know, you're getting
to be the age</i>

1413
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,569
<i>when I became a dad.</i>

1414
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,155
<i>Weird, right?</i>

1415
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,533
<i>Gonna be honest here.</i>

1416
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,952
<i>I never thought I wanted kids.</i>

1417
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,955
<i>And, man, I tell you,</i>

1418
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,750
<i>it is not a conversation
you wanna have</i>

1419
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,752
<i>with a pregnant woman.</i>

1420
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:58,546
<i>That definitely bit me
in the ass.</i>

1421
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,134
<i>What tore me up
is after you were born,</i>

1422
01:27:03,217 --> 01:27:04,969
<i>I still didn't want a kid.</i>

1423
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:10,433
<i>But I... I wanted Lucas.</i>

1424
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:19,400
<i>When you were a kid
and I started skating with you,</i>

1425
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,987
<i>I fell in love with it
because I finally found</i>

1426
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:26,032
<i>a language to speak with you.</i>

1427
01:27:26,115 --> 01:27:29,827
<i>But you learn other languages.</i>

1428
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:34,374
<i>And, uh, with the apartments,
they're important.</i>

1429
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:39,128
<i>Not because of the cash
or superficial value,</i>

1430
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:42,465
<i>but because I wanted
to leave you something</i>

1431
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:44,801
<i>that you could use.</i>

1432
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:48,179
<i>Something you could have
as a man, you know.</i>

1433

1434
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:55,687
[Augusto] <i>I'm not gonna
tell you how to manage it</i>

1435
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,356
<i>or to even manage it at all,</i>

1436
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,692
<i>but there's definitely
some things</i>

1437
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,235
<i>worth learning from the tenants.</i>

1438
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:06,572
<i>I have some stories
you might get a kick out of.</i>

1439
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,576
[chuckling]

1440
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:15,164
<i>But I am just enjoying
the process.</i>

1441
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,582
<i>You may too.</i>

1442
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,881
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

1443
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:29,804
<i>I just want you to know
that I love you.</i>

1444
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:33,433
<i>And planet Earth has got
a few more rotations in it.</i>

1445
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,399
<i>Oh, and also...</i>

1446
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,402
<i>there's a really wonky pipe
under the bathroom sink.</i>

1447
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:48,197
<i>Get Frank to help you
with that before I forget.</i>

1448
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,491
<i>You don't need
that kind of drama.</i>
