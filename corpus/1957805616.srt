1
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,836
Today's the day.

2
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,719
Today's the day.

3
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,087
What?
Don't look at me like that.

4
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,422
It could happen.

5
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,465
Good morning.

6
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,244
Yes.

7
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:52,714
Yes!

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,250
I'll think about it.

9
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,825
That's a proposal-worthy face.
Right?

10
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,493
Well, I'd marry you.

11
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,551
Hey. Teddy? Come on.

12
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,702
What? You lick your own butt.

13
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,938
I'm feeling much better,
thank you for asking.

14
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,421
Oh.

15
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,067
<i>So, when do we pick up the ring?</i>

16
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,123
Morning, Mom.

17
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,456
You know, I already told you

18
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,244
I'm gonna pick up the ring
on my lunch hour.

19
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,204
So, you know, I actually
don't need any help.

20
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,529
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>
- Thanks.

21
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:22,940
<i>But you know
how forgetful you are.</i>

22
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,532
<i>And that cold medicine
makes you loopy.</i>

23
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,299
Yeah, well, I don't know,

24
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,511
I feel like I'm not gonna forget

25
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:28,903
my engagement ring,

26
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,138
even with a cold.

27
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,539
But I appreciate it.

28
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,741
<i>And don't stop taking
that medicine.</i>

29
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,576
<i>You know,
no woman wants to say yes</i>

30
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,377
<i>to a crusty nose.</i>

31
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,915
<i>You have to remember
you only have one day a year</i>

32
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,950
<i>when you can propose
on December 30th.</i>

33
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,753
<i>You know, three generations
of Reeds can't be wrong.</i>

34
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,588
Yeah, I'm well aware.
No, I know.

35
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,465
But I gotta go, okay?
But I'll talk to you later.

36
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,491
<i>Oh, who'd have thought, my son,</i>

37
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,828
<i>two times Student Samaritan
of the Month,</i>

38
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,632
<i>engaged to a girl with
her own park bench? Like...</i>

39
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,200
I know. I know.

40
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,334
All right, well, I love you,
okay? Gotta go. Bye.

41
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,601
<i>Oh, and just one more thing...</i>

42
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:05,006
Oh, shit!

43
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,342
Dad proposed to you
after one week.

44
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,912
<i>Well, that was a different time.</i>

45
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,613
<i>And your dad wanted to get laid.</i>

46
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,816
<i>Oh, as a matter of fact,
he's on his way back now.</i>

47
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,383
<i>We're in our hotel room, so...</i>

48
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,052
Okay, TMI, Mom.

49
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,621
Anyway, he made
dinner reservations

50
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,657
and says he wants to talk.

51
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,225
<i>Oh, I hope it's not cancer.</i>

52
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,459
What if the first time
you're meeting my boyfriend,

53
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,362
you're actually
meeting my fiancé?

54
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,532
<i>Okay, we've been
down this road before</i>

55
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,800
<i>and it never ends well.</i>

56
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,310
<i>Look, you have a date
to the wedding,</i>

57
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,636
<i>just take the win.</i>

58
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,105
I wonder if it's too late
to get a spray tan.

59
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,574
<i>Your sister will kill you</i>

60
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,118
<i>if you have a tan
at her winter wedding.</i>

61
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:44,612
Well, maybe I want to be
tanned for my winter proposal.

62
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,223
<i>I will meet you
at the bridal shop at noon.</i>

63
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,448
<i>Do not be late. Again.</i>

64
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,084
<i>Love you.</i>

65
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,453
Morning, Doris.

66
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,223
Double tall latte.

67
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,491
You are the sweetest lawyer
in the entire building.

68
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,794
Stop.

69
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,863
Oh. Um...

70
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,731
Yeah, it's actually
not what you think it is.

71
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,800
Oh, well, it looks like coffee.

72
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,035
Well, then I guess it is
what you think it is, Doris.

73
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,103
There we go.

74
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,437
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

75
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,273
Big night tonight.

76
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,308
Yeah, you a little nervous?

77
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,143
Well, clearly.
Oh, shit. Nice.

78
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,511
I get it. It's not every day

79
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,014
you propose
to the hottest chick in town.

80
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,249
Oh.

81
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,426
Okay, can you please not refer
to my future wife as a chick?

82
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,685
Oh, sorry.

83
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,021
- Empress. Duchess. Mistress.
- You know what? No.

84
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,098
She's not like that, okay?

85
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,624
Oh, yeah?
You use her Sonic are again?

86
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,491
No, I already told you,
that was my fault.

87
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,836
- I should've asked.
- Listen, buddy.

88
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,595
There is
an unspoken list of things

89
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,998
that couples in relationships
can share.

90
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,033
Okay? You've got porn,

91
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,301
you've got razors,

92
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,069
toothbrushes.

93
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,348
- Mostly porn.
- Okay. I'm just gonna need you

94
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:45,682
to stop worrying
about my girlfriend

95
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:46,850
and just focus
on getting your own, okay?

96
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,441
Hey, I'm working on it, man.

97
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,779
"I am Sam" is up
on Hinge and Tinder.

98
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,080
You know that's a movie

99
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:54,667
about the mentally
disabled guy, right?

100
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,483
- Shit.
- Just saying.

101
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,252
I thought I was low on matches.

102
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,591
Oh, my God.

103
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:05,393
You missed the best party.

104
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,727
Totally should have come.

105
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,305
Yeah, I wanted to,
but all you texted me

106
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,564
was the side of a building
and the name "Paco."

107
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,868
Paco! Oh, my God. So cute.

108
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,636
We should all
grab drinks at lunch.

109
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,005
I can't. I have the stupid
final dress fitting.

110
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,440
My sister's worried I'm gonna
put on a late 10 pounds

111
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,209
and ruin her perfect aesthetic.

112
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,476
Fine. After work, then.

113
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,445
Stop pretending
like you don't know

114
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,382
what's possibly
maybe happening tonight.

115
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,951
Why are you getting engaged

116
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,119
to a man who's hiding
from your friends?

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,389
He's not hiding. He's earning
his third-degree black belt.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,091
I mean, that's time-consuming.

119
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,560
And he's getting over
a really bad cold.

120
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,095
For three months?

121
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,763
Can you just support me?

122
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,133
Okay? I think I have
finally found Mr. Right.

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,035
I do support you.

124
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:51,439
I just think Mr. Right is not
the guy that calls you

125
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,341
while he's sitting on your face.

126
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,675
My face is on a park bench.

127
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,086
You're supposed to sit on it
and call me.

128
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,180
If they're shopping for homes,
not vagina.

129
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,182
He said it was fate.

130
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,550
No!

131
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,951
It's advertising.

132
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,286
Fate is magical.

133
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:07,054
Fate is supernatural.

134
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,157
Fate is meeting Calvin Harris
at Coachella,

135
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,491
losing him in a crowd,

136
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,294
then waking up in Joshua Tree

137
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:16,897
to find him making s'mores
by an open campfire.

138
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,499
Without his shirt on.

139
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,103
That was a fun weekend.

140
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,504
I have to work. Please.

141
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,572
Oh, my God.

142
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:25,940
Oh, my God.

143
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,241
Oh, my God. You're so boring.

144
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,709
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

145
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,444
<i>And you're positive he's coming.</i>

146
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,480
<i>Yes, he's coming.</i>

147
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,248
Why do you keep asking me?

148
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,816
Because no one's even met him.

149
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,052
And you do have a history
of fake boyfriends.

150
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,154
Okay, that was one time.

151
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,222
Kip is real.

152
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,324
He's my date.
You're gonna love him.

153
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:45,459
- It's $40 a plate.
- So?

154
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,837
- $40 a plate. It's just...
- Okay, so?

155
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,071
We're not having
a rehearsal dinner,

156
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,864
so we can have
a really nice reception.

157
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,975
And if he's not coming, then
we'll invite Brian's Auntie V.

158
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,969
Oh, okay. Well, screw Auntie V
because he's coming.

159
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,747
And if he doesn't, I'll be
sure to write you a check.

160
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:57,981
Well, you can
write it out to me.

161
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,282
Who do you think
is paying for this thing?

162
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,509
Isn't the groom's family

163
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,052
traditionally supposed to pay
for that part?

164
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,611
- Mm...
- Okay, sorry, are you calling

165
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,812
Brian's family cheap?

166
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,147
No, they happen to be taking us

167
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,313
to a really fancy brunch
the day after the wedding.

168
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,227
Are we almost done here?
Because I don't want

169
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,628
to be late for my spray tan
appointment, so...

170
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,953
No, no. Mom? See, I told you.

171
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,188
She's gonna ruin the wedding.

172
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,424
Okay, how is
me getting a spray tan

173
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,792
gonna ruin the wedding?

174
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,528
I don't know.
You'll turn yourself orange

175
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,530
or you'll get UV-poisoning
and die.

176
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,715
You will figure out some way

177
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,099
to make my wedding all about...

178
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,233
you.

179
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,770
- Prom?
- Still haven't let that go?

180
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:30,971
- Yeah.
- It's not my fault

181
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,716
that Dylan Kidd
liked me better than you.

182
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,117
Well, you're the one
who gave him a blow job

183
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,876
in the guest bathroom.
So, it is your fault.

184
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,183
Yeah, well, that's because
you take forever to get ready.

185
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,680
Mom?

186
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,449
It is true, you do.

187
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,552
I knew it. I knew I should've
asked Gloria Hefner

188
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,652
to be my maid of honor.

189
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,187
Gloria Hefner has one eyebrow.

190
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,022
How fast can you make
another dress?

191
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,024
No, no, no.
She's out of the wedding!

192
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,701
- Out, out, yes! Yeah.
- Promise? Swear? Promise?

193
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,129
Okay, girls, girls, girls!
Enough.

194
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,263
You're sisters.

195
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,166
So, that means, by law,
you are bound to pretend

196
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,002
to love each other and
be in each other's weddings.

197
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,004
That's just how it goes. Okay?

198
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:09,043
So, why don't you two say
something nice to each other?

199
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,379
Nothing comes to mind, so...

200
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,583
Here you go, sir.
Sized and shined.

201
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,518
Oh, my God.

202
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:17,952
Oh, honey, no, no.

203
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,987
Mom, what are you doing here?

204
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,398
I told you,
I don't any help today.

205
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,966
Well, from the looks
of this box, you do.

206
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,258
What's wrong with the box?

207
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:26,794
Well, it's just dull.
I mean, it doesn't sing to me.

208
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,963
Do you have these
in another color

209
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,198
like gold, or glitter,
or faux fur?

210
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:34,201
Yeah, apparently we're looking
for the Beyoncé of ring boxes.

211
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:35,336
We just have these.

212
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,272
My only son is getting engaged
for the very first time in...

213
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,473
I mean, you can understand

214
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,742
how I just want
this proposal to be perfect.

215
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,144
And it will be perfect, okay?

216
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,788
So, you don't really
have to worry about it.

217
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,249
Uh-huh. So, maybe,
I could hear it first?

218
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,851
- Hear what?
- Your proposal speech.

219
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,319
Oh, no. No, no, no.

220
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,622
Absolutely not. No.

221
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,122
Just try it out.
Just for safety.

222
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,958
No, I'm not proposing
to my mother. That's crazy.

223
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,828
Okay. Suit yourself.

224
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,376
- Sorry, this is...
- It's a nice box.

225
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,698
It's a really nice box.

226
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,676
Well, it's only the
single-most important thing

227
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,504
you'll ever say
to a woman, but, uh,

228
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,106
you'll be fine just winging it.

229
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,208
Okay. You know what? One time.

230
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,409
But you say nothing.

231
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,912
All right.

232
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:25,819
Babe?

233
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,354
Ever since I saw your face,

234
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,491
staring up at me
from that park bench,

235
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,127
I knew that you were
the one for me.

236
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,697
Your beauty, your drive,
your energy...

237
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,501
I mean, I never thought
that some guy like me

238
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,537
would end up with
an incredible woman like you.

239
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,406
You inspire me.

240
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,641
You challenge me.

241
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,175
You push me
out of my comfort zone

242
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,477
because I know you just
want me to be a better man.

243
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,781
And because of you, I am.

244
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,317
Clementine,

245
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,320
will you please
do me the great honor

246
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,386
of becoming my wife?

247
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,790
Oh! Honey, of course, I will.

248
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,825
- Aw.
- All right.

249
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,227
That's that. All right.

250
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,762
- Oh! Oh, God!
- No, it's not cool. Just...

251
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,565
I'll take these.

252
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,306
Wow!

253
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,375
You look stunning.

254
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,877
You look quite dapper yourself.

255
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,264
I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

256
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,756
Oh, well, I'm still taking
the cold medicine,

257
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,048
just to be safe.

258
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,985
<i>Yeah, I know this place is
kind of a surprise, but, um,</i>

259
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,687
you know,
it's sentimental for me.

260
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,887
My family actually does

261
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,022
their New Year's day brunch
here, every year.

262
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,824
I think Bennigan's is fun.

263
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,401
I mean, the cocktails
are super creative.

264
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,928
Ooh, yeah,
should we order drinks?

265
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,296
Peach on the Beach looks good.

266
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,431
Oh, my God, Peach on the Beach
is the best.

267
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:49,136
I am so excited for tomorrow.

268
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,171
I mean, I can't wait for you
to meet my family.

269
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,940
<i>Uh, the wedding starts
at 7:00.</i>

270
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,209
Yeah, yeah. So, I'm just
gonna go into the city,

271
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,378
meet the guys, and then,
I should have plenty of time

272
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,580
to come back, shower.

273
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,848
And then, uh, I'll be
at your place by 9:00?

274
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,259
I picked up your tux
from the dry cleaner,

275
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,784
so you can just get ready
at mine.

276
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,219
Perfect.

277
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,490
You know, it's funny,

278
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,992
even though we haven't
been together that long...

279
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,529
I know, I can't believe
it's only been three months.

280
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,730
Feels like forever.

281
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:16,906
You know, it's funny, my parents

282
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,499
actually have this saying,

283
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,069
"When you know, you know."

284
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,672
"When you know, you know."

285
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:24,938
Believe it or not, they, uh...

286
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,008
they actually got engaged
at a Bennigan's.

287
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,980
Welcome to Bennigan's.

288
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,649
OMG.

289
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:35,949
I know you.

290
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,951
You're
the Fletcher's Mattress girl.

291
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,521
You're even prettier in person.

292
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,355
Thank you, that's so sweet.

293
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,857
You know, she's also
the Muffinland Bakery Queen.

294
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,527
Um, could I get a selfie?

295
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:46,661
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

296
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,062
I think it's for the best.

297
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,463
You think it's best to dump me

298
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:51,065
the night before
my sister's wedding?

299
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,933
We have had
a beautiful adventure

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,168
the last few months.

301
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,303
But before
things get complicated,

302
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,038
you know,
with meeting the family

303
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,007
and seating assignments and...

304
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,710
Uh, I don't want to be a dick.

305
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,056
Oh, you don't want to be a dick?

306
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,179
Well, that's exactly
what you're being, Kip.

307
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,880
- You're being a dick.
- Whoa.

308
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,315
Okay. Um, look,

309
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:11,018
I know that my assistant
messed up the reservation.

310
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:12,754
La Boucherie, Bennigan's.

311
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,522
We can still have a nice dinner,

312
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,856
even though it's not French.

313
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,300
No, we can't have
a nice dinner, Kip.

314
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,127
Okay? And what, did you think
it would be nicer

315
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,197
to dump me over truffle fries
and escargot?

316
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,265
One, two, three. Hey.

317
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,900
- There you go.
- Oh, my God!

318
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,703
- Thank you!
- Yeah, of course.

319
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,970
I'm literally going to die.

320
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,139
Oh, no! Maybe we can get
our drinks first?

321
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:34,942
You're funny.

322
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,611
- He's funny.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

323
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,179
Are you, um... Are you
her manager or something?

324
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:42,983
Griffin is actually
a brilliant lawyer.

325
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,953
He's about to join
my uncle's firm.

326
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:48,790
I am?

327
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:50,097
One of the partners is leaving.

328
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,892
<i>Margot, I meditated
on this last night.</i>

329
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,262
And it came to me in a dream
the timing is just not right.

330
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,798
But maybe in another life.

331
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,600
In another life, what?

332
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,568
- Reincarnation.
- Oh!

333
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,403
Yes, it's another chance...

334
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,838
- Okay.
- ...and that is on the way

335
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,205
to nirvana.

336
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,709
Wow, well, thank you so much,
Kurt Cobain.

337
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,243
That's not the right Nirvana.

338
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,588
And that's what
I'm talking about.

339
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,279
It's just, something's not...

340
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,047
What're you doing?
You're overreacting.

341
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,925
- Come on, sit down.
- You think I'm overreacting?

342
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,285
Okay, this is not overreacting.

343
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,588
This would be overreacting!

344
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:24,291
Peach on the Beach.
What do they put in that?

345
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,527
What is going on?

346
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:26,528
It's been three months.

347
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,596
What were you expecting?
A proposal?

348
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:31,932
I mean...

349
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,269
No.

350
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,571
Oh...

351
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:38,640
shit. Okay. Um...

352
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,207
This is awkward.

353
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:43,010
Okay.

354
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,881
Margot, wait.

355
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,583
Yeah?

356
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:52,119
I am gonna need the tux.

357
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:53,621
Do not call me.

358
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:54,722
Ever.

359
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,190
Ever, ever.

360
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,291
Again.

361
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,860
All right.

362
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,297
Oh, my God,
that was so embarrassing.

363
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,534
Babe? From the moment
that I saw your face

364
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,335
looking up at me
from that park bench...

365
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,804
Oh, my God, are you proposing?

366
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,138
Um...

367
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,339
- Yes.
- Yes!

368
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,575
- Yes?
- Yes! Oh, my God!

369
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,175
- Yes? Oh, my God.
- Yes, I'm so happy!

370
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,144
Oh, my God, I love you
so much. Yes, of course.

371
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,388
Now, can you please sit down?
Sit down.

372
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,652
You don't want to see the ring?

373
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,424
Oh, I'm sure it's beautiful.
I'm sure it's beautiful.

374
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,819
Just, um, save it
for the real proposal. Okay?

375
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,286
- The real proposal?
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,088
Tomorrow night
at our New Year's Eve party.

377
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,289
It'll be perfect.

378
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,525
But, this is perfect.

379
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:32,760
Tonight. You know,
it's December 30th.

380
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,094
It's a Reed family tradition.

381
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,763
I love your traditions.

382
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,965
I just...

383
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,901
We are technically engaged.
Yay.

384
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,235
Just do it again like that.

385
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,771
Tomorrow.
And I will say yes, again.

386
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,850
I... I don't want to do it
again tomorrow, you know?

387
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,174
I just... I just did it.

388
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,176
Here, now. I mean, almost.

389
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,410
Griffin, I...

390
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,655
I just don't see
what the big deal is.

391
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,648
Like, you just got
your proposal.

392
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:55,583
And then, me and my followers
can get mine.

393
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,620
Well, I guess
the big deal is that

394
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,923
I don't want our proposal
to be some photo op

395
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,223
for your social media.

396
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,592
It's about us.

397
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,628
It will be about us.

398
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:10,732
But I have a responsibility
to my public and my sponsors.

399
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,166
Griffin, you know
I'm a professional influencer,

400
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,068
which means that I get paid

401
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,137
when I influence
other people's lives.

402
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,707
Like, what I wear

403
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:21,375
and what I eat

404
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,811
and where I get engaged.

405
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,413
There is no chance in hell
that I'm going to waste

406
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,149
a once-in-a-lifetime
golden opportunity

407
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:33,153
for Death by Chocolate
and Turkey O'Tooles, no.

408
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,698
Wait, wait, come on.
You're gonna leave?

409
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:37,257
- We just got engaged.
- Whoa. No, no. We did not.

410
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:40,093
I am taking back my yes.

411
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,666
- Hey!
- No, no.

412
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,672
Oh, great.

413
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,707
- Thank you so much.
- What?

414
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,207
- Thank you.
- I don't work here.

415
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,586
- Take me to Maple, please.
- No, no, no!

416
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,476
- Can't hear you, sorry.
- Great.

417
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:57,712
Just great.

418
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,714
This is...

419
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,416
Ugh. Come on.

420
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,919
- Um, did you see...?
- Are you looking for

421
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,589
a tall, redhead, super rude?

422
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,356
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I saw her.

423
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:11,859
She actually just left
in my Uber.

424
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,293
Oh, here, she gave me this.

425
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,631
Oh. Thanks.
Yeah, sorry, she was upset.

426
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:19,366
Great job, Bennigan's.
Great job.

427
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:22,269
Uh, do you need help?

428
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,671
Uh...

429
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,074
Not unless you got
an engagement ring

430
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,441
in your pocket.

431
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,077
Uh...

432
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,178
This is me.

433
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,646
Good morning, Judy.

434
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,824
<i>It's almost noon.
Your sister's losing her mind.</i>

435
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:08,583
<i>The wedding planner
is stuck in Vermont</i>

436
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,585
<i>and the bridal shop
forgot to pack the veil.</i>

437
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,452
<i>And the maid of honor
is still in bed.</i>

438
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,788
I'm not still in bed.

439
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,690
<i>Christ, he didn't propose,
did he?</i>

440
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:17,659
<i>You got your hopes up
and you were wrong,</i>

441
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,259
<i>and now you're falling apart.</i>

442
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,062
I'm not falling apart.
No, Mom.

443
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:24,699
I am not feeling well. At all.

444
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,502
I don't think I should go
to the wedding.

445
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,836
I could be contagious.

446
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,039
<i>So, this Kip
is still your plus one?</i>

447
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,507
- Yes.
- <i>All right, then.</i>

448
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,051
<i>You need to shower yourself
in Benadryl,</i>

449
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:35,943
<i>ice your puffy face
and get your butt down</i>

450
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,378
<i>to the hotel to help
your sister get married.</i>

451
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,581
Okay. I'll de-puff.

452
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,083
<i>And you'll pick up the veil.</i>

453
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,450
Yes, I'll pick up...

454
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,887
We will pick up the veil.

455
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:51,324
I'm in hell.

456
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,406
- Surprise!
- Jesus Christ!

457
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,475
I got Zara to loan us
an amazing suit

458
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:09,744
for the party tonight.

459
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:13,280
Sorry, am I missing
something here?

460
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,783
Yes.

461
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,519
Me, apologizing.

462
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:22,422
Look, I'm really sorry
about last night.

463
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,993
If you still want my "yes,"
it's all yours.

464
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,563
Yeah, you know what,

465
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,297
I'm really sorry too, okay?
I just...

466
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,467
All I want is for you to have
the proposal of your dreams.

467
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:35,169
Okay? And so, if that means

468
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,038
that we monetize the engagement,

469
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:39,439
then, yeah, let's...
let's do it.

470
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,943
- I support you.
- Oh, thank you.

471
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,183
Oh, that... That...

472
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,785
That looks so good.

473
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:52,687
Uh, you're acting strange.

474
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:53,621
Are you okay?

475
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,757
Oh. Yes. Sorry, I'm just...

476
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,693
I overslept and I'm gonna be
late to meet the guys, so...

477
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,195
I just don't really see
why you have to go.

478
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,496
Oh. Yeah. No, I know.

479
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,208
But it's just like our
tradition since law school.

480
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:05,475
You know,
Sam's family is Russian.

481
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,034
They just love bathhouses, so...

482
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:08,236
Yeah.

483
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,038
And you know that
I love traditions, but, uh,

484
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,907
traditions can change.

485
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,976
I have to pee.
Try on the suit.

486
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,079
Hey, babe, two drink maximum
tonight. Okay?

487
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,506
Remember,
vodka is not your friend.

488
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:20,948
Vodka's not my friend.
You got it.

489
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,817
Hey, how about
I just try this on later.

490
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,360
And then,
you could be surprised. Huh?

491
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,521
Did you use my toothbrush?

492
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:28,355
Uh, no, why?

493
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,624
It's wet.

494
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,092
Oh, well, I mean,
I took a shower.

495
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,836
So, I probably just splashed
on it or something.

496
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,530
Hmm. I leave it here
because I trust you.

497
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:38,199
And relationships
are built on trust.

498
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,367
Uh, don't you think
it's weird that you kiss me,

499
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,769
but I can't use your toothbrush?

500
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:42,870
No.

501
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:44,972
Some things
aren't meant to be shared.

502
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,742
- Oral hygiene is one of them.
- Oh.

503
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:51,444
<i>Davai, davai!</i>

504
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,647
<i>Davai!</i>

505
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,217
She said "yes"?
And then she said "no"?

506
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:59,554
Yes. But it's a yes, I think.

507
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,822
Maybe she changed her mind

508
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:03,991
about marrying
a lowly public defender.

509
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:06,194
No, wrong. She supports me.

510
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,930
She just thinks I should make
a move into corporate.

511
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,065
You hate corporate.

512
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,201
I don't hate corporate.

513
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,347
Are you leaving the office?

514
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,204
No, I mean, it's just a maybe.

515
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,672
Clementine's uncle has a firm.

516
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,240
So, she just wants
me to consider it.

517
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:21,309
Hey, buddy. What do you want?

518
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,877
Listen, I'm getting
what I want, okay?

519
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:24,377
I'm getting...
I'm getting her.

520
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,614
Tonight, I'm making it
official, again.

521
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,115
- You're getting married?
- Yeah.

522
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,652
Yes, a little to celebrate.

523
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,721
Oh, no, no, no. No.

524
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:35,732
I told Clementine I'm not
gonna drink today, so...

525
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:38,192
<i>Nyet!</i> Nonsense,
get up, get up.

526
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,327
Up, up, up, up, up.

527
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,461
You will get married.
We toast.

528
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,097
This is the best vodka
in the world.

529
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:45,533
My grandmother had this
at her wedding.

530
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,400
You cannot insult his <i>babushka.</i>

531
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,104
Okay, I'm not gonna insult
anyone's <i>babushka.</i> One shot.

532
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,438
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

533
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:52,640
Oh, no, no, no.

534
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,284
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
All the way. All the way.

535
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:55,676
Smell, smell.

536
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:56,743
Right.

537
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:00,380
One more cheer.

538
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,917
The beautiful Clementine!

539
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,725
Ooh.

540
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,095
<i>Oh, my darling Oh, my darling</i>

541
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,130
<i>Clementina</i>

542
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:17,331
Whoo-hoo!

543
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,533
<i>Clementina</i>

544
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,669
<i>Clementina</i>

545
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:24,572
<i>Clementina</i>

546
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,374
<i>Clementina</i>

547
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:31,178
Last one.

548
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,949
- Whoo-hoo!
- Let's go!

549
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:48,428
<i>Darling, oh, my darling</i>

550
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:53,466
<i>-Oh, my darling, Clementina</i>
-GROUP: <i>Clementina, Clementina</i>

551
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,570
Thank you.

552
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,906
I have to say a proper goodbye.

553
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,574
Hey, put yourself...

554
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:01,943
Hey, what's your name?

555
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,077
Gevorg.

556
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:04,245
Ah, that's my aunt's name.

557
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,451
Okay, I love you too, Gevorg.

558
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,988
Deliver her to 15 Maple Drive,
Norwood.

559
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:17,892
15 Maple...

560
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,227
Go get her, my friend.

561
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,595
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

562
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:23,496
- Yep.
<i>- Do svidaniya.</i>

563
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,538
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

564
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:32,907
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

565
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,408
Maybe I should just call him.

566
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,743
The guy just dumped you.

567
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,379
He doesn't get a call.
He gets a beating.

568
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,649
I'm sorry, you're not allowed
to have alcohol in here.

569
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:43,150
What about a broken heart?

570
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,052
Is she allowed to have
one of those in here?

571
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,119
We're sorry.

572
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,633
I thought this was
a place of healing.

573
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,391
Look, seriously,
what am I going to do?

574
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,759
I can't show up without a date.

575
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:54,161
How about him?
He seems fun.

576
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,998
What?
The wedding's in four hours.

577
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,033
- You can't afford to be picky.
- Forget it.

578
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,811
I can't just pick up
some random guy off the street

579
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,245
and bring him
to my sister's wedding.

580
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,504
Sure, you can.

581
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:04,805
Hey.

582
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:09,210
Want to go to a wedding later?

583
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,511
Uh...

584
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,086
Uh, I have plans. Or I would.

585
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:20,821
Of course, you would.

586
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,258
This is so stupid.

587
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,726
I mean, what kind of a loser

588
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,633
doesn't already have a date
for New Year's Eve?

589
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,163
Don't answer that.

590
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,631
Got him.

591
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:33,834
He's free tonight and he's cute.

592
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,770
Perfect.

593
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,590
15 Maple Drive?

594
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,259
That's right. 15 Maple Drive.

595
00:25:58,325 --> 00:25:59,427
15 Maple Drive.

596
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:01,695
$96.15

597
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,933
Wait. Maybe $46.15.

598
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,470
But it's fine.
'Cause it's New Year's Eve.

599
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,605
You're supposed to get a tip.

600
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,508
You robbed me.

601
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:14,575
You robbed me.

602
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,210
Okay, my friend.
Happy New Year.

603
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:21,182
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

604
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,622
Come here, you.

605
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,525
Oh. Oh, shit.

606
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,055
Hi, Teddy.

607
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,357
What are you doing up there?

608
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,260
Why are you so dirty?

609
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,800
Clementine! Look at you.

610
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,008
We're gonna have
to talk about that.

611
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,866
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

612
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,868
- Well, I live here!
- I live here!

613
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:57,338
- This is my bed.
- This is my bed.

614
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,405
- Really?
- What?

615
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:01,075
What a coincidence! We both
have a one-eyed teddy bear?

616
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,810
What? Oh.

617
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,111
Why are you naked?

618
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,946
I don't know, I guess I...
I took a shower.

619
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,173
- I'm calling the police.
- Do I look scary? I'm naked.

620
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:09,450
That's exactly what's scary.

621
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:11,919
- Don't... Don't call the cops.
- 9-1-1.

622
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:14,021
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

623
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:16,357
There is a naked deranged man
in my house.

624
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,001
- Not deranged, actually.
<i>- Does he have a weapon?</i>

625
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,059
Do you have a weapon?

626
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,461
Do I look like I have a weapon?

627
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,931
- Ow.
- Karma.

628
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,742
That's what you get
for breaking into my house.

629
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,934
<i>Ma'am, are you in danger?</i>

630
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:28,235
Oh, I didn't break in.

631
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,838
Jesus! I used the spare key
under the flower pot.

632
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:32,873
Wha...
And how did you know

633
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,109
there's a spare key
under my flower pot?

634
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:36,343
Because there's a spare key

635
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,978
under every flower pot
in Norwood.

636
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:39,523
Ha! You're not in Norwood,
you're in Westwood.

637
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:40,957
<i>Ma'am, can you please
repeat the address?</i>

638
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,617
I am? Jesus.

639
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,552
- Thanks a lot, Gevorg.
- Who?

640
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,020
Who's that? Are you alone?

641
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,264
<i>Is there another intruder
in the house?</i>

642
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,658
Yeah, of course, I'm alone.
I think.

643
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:53,060
Oh, no. I'm gonna die. This is
just like <i>Basic Instinct.</i>

644
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:54,696
No, no, no. In <i>Basic Instinct,</i>

645
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,674
she ties the guy to the bed
and kills him with an icepick.

646
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,932
So, if this is <i>Basic Instinct,</i>
then I should be scared.

647
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,267
Then it's <i>Jagged Edge.</i>

648
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:02,613
In <i>Jagged Edge,</i> Jeff Bridges
is wearing a ski mask.

649
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:04,381
- I'm wearing a towel.
- Then it's <i>Rear Window.</i>

650
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,240
In <i>Rear Window,</i>
Jimmy Stewart is in a cast,

651
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,841
and Raymond Burr kills his wife

652
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,152
in a completely
different apartment.

653
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:10,444
It doesn't even make sense.

654
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:11,879
<i>Ma'am, do you even watch movies?</i>

655
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,265
I don't always
make it to the end.

656
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,091
I don't know what's going on
here, but I'm harmless.

657
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,835
- Okay? I swear.
<i>- He sounds harmless to me.</i>

658
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,085
Fine.

659
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,655
But if he dismembers me and
makes lamps out of my skin,

660
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,089
it's on you.

661
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:24,091
Just stay, sit.

662
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:26,193
Don't bleed on anything.

663
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:29,631
Oh, my God.

664
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,237
- Here.
- Ow!

665
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,340
- That hurts.
- You're welcome.

666
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,712
Not to be weird,

667
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,647
but have we met?

668
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,549
No, we haven't met.

669
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:49,983
I... I'm a real-estate agent.

670
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,020
Maybe you've seen my face
on a park bench.

671
00:30:53,087 --> 00:30:54,988
Mm... No, that wasn't it.

672
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,959
Oh, my God! Last night
at Bennigan's parking lot.

673
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:00,961
Okay, are you stalking me?

674
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,731
No, oh, my God, no. I swear.

675
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:03,931
I don't know why I'm here.

676
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:05,734
But I live at 15 Maple Drive.

677
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,802
This is 15 Maple Drive.

678
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:11,338
What?
No, that's... that's crazy.

679
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,917
- Oh, no, who's that?
- How should I know?

680
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,143
Apparently, this is your house.

681
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:18,613
Kip?

682
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
- What do you want?
- My tux.

683
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,115
I texted you I was coming.

684
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,150
I didn't get it.
I... I blocked you.

685
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,352
- A bit soon, don't you think?
- Goodbye.

686
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:27,722
Just let me get my tux.
And I'll be gone.

687
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:30,257
The tux you were supposed to
wear to my sister's wedding?

688
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:32,259
Yeah, it's a really nice tux.
And I have a...

689
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:33,961
Fuck.

690
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,732
Um... Uh...

691
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,133
Hi. This...

692
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,735
- I...
- Who the hell is this?

693
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,713
- I don't know. Who are you?
- I'm her boyfriend.

694
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:43,937
Ex-boyfriend.

695
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,240
We broke up
less than 24 hours ago.

696
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,843
And there's already some
naked guy in your apartment?

697
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,678
- I mean, how...
- We didn't break up.

698
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,279
You broke up with me.

699
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,549
Wait, you broke up with her
right before New Year's Eve?

700
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,183
What a dick!

701
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,451
I know, right? Thank you.

702
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,821
The naked dude
is calling me a dick.

703
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:01,231
What? Do you have
a problem with that?

704
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,525
Trust me,
you should hope that I don't.

705
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:04,491
Okay, no, no, no.

706
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,961
You will not threaten my guest.

707
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,798
What is going on here?

708
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,567
Are you drunk?
Is this all you?

709
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,635
So, what if I am?

710
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,274
You've drunken some rosé and
you've picked up some loser.

711
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:17,971
Actually, I'm a lawyer, so...

712
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,273
You are?

713
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:20,474
Ha.

714
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:22,352
You don't even know what
naked guy does for a living.

715
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:23,953
He could be a serial killer,
he could be crazy.

716
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,279
I'm not naked anymore.

717
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:27,123
Yeah, he can be naked
if he wants to be naked.

718
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,348
In fact, we can be naked

719
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,815
all over the place
if we want to be.

720
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,485
What does that mean?

721
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,320
It means...

722
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:36,858
do you want to go to a wedding
with me tonight?

723
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,092
Wh... Mm... Uh...

724
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,272
All right, okay,
I've seen enough.

725
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,346
Goodbye, Kip.

726
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:00,447
- Seriously?
- I mean,

727
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:01,982
it felt pretty serious to me.

728
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:04,786
Okay, no, I get it now.
This is a test.

729
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,121
Fortunately, for you,
I went through

730
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:11,960
a grueling heart chakra
healing this morning

731
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:14,328
with my guru over Zoom.

732
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,230
So, I am not about to lose

733
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,265
the progress that I made
over this.

734
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,534
- Okay.
- Okay.

735
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,603
But, if I see you again,

736
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:25,038
Sadeep is not going to be happy.

737
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:26,541
Okay, okay, enough.

738
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,409
Goodbye.

739
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,377
Oh, my God.

740
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:32,647
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, no.

741
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:34,983
I don't know
what came over me, I was...

742
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:36,383
It's totally fine.

743
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,385
But, you know,
I should get going.

744
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,254
Um... Yeah, I was... I just...

745
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,524
About the wedding...

746
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:44,258
Oh, that was real?

747
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:46,093
You probably have plans.

748
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,295
I mean, yeah,
you could say that.

749
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,197
Yeah, and I mean, who would...

750
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,132
who would go to a wedding
with a total stranger

751
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,467
on New Year's Eve?

752
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:59,306
Um... Well, this has, uh,
been interesting.

753
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:03,745
You see, my sister is getting
married in about two hours.

754
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:05,445
And I'm the maid of honor.

755
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,815
And that guy who just left was
supposed to be my plus one.

756
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:09,593
And everyone was like,
"Don't get your hopes up."

757
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:11,361
But, what did I do?
I went and got my hopes up,

758
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,955
and it's $40 a plate.

759
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,289
And if I show up alone,

760
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,891
I'll have to sit
next to an empty chair

761
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,627
surrounded by happy couples
and judgy relatives,

762
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,295
and I'll be
the last girl standing

763
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,797
when the band starts to play.

764
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:24,608
And the first girl shoved out
onto the dance floor

765
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,301
to catch that stupid
overpriced bouquet.

766
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:32,439
And I mean, I would rather die
a slow and painful death

767
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:34,509
than participate
in that humiliating

768
00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,276
sexist <i>Hunger Games</i> tradition...

769
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,680
You know? I just...
Aah!

770
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:39,948
Ah...

771
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:42,684
Look, I, um... I really can't.

772
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:44,519
I really... I really can't.

773
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,021
No, of course.

774
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,355
I mean, I sound psycho.

775
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,157
No, no, not at all.

776
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,125
Um...

777
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:55,530
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

778
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,700
Oh, yeah.
It's my favorite movie.

779
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,702
My cat's name is Cat.

780
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,336
Mine too.

781
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,605
You have a cat named Cat?

782
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:05,540
No, uh, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

783
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,742
I have a <i>Breakfast</i>
<i>at Tiffany's</i> poster

784
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:08,843
in my kitchen.

785
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,745
My cat is named Ted.

786
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,721
Well, anyway, um, thanks
for not calling the cops.

787
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:20,822
Yeah, thanks

788
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:22,356
for not murdering me.

789
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:25,459
Okay, well, goodbye.

790
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:39,540
- Yes?
- Hey.

791
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:41,809
Uh, I just, I forgot my bag.

792
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,112
- Oh. Oh.
- It's right over there.

793
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:45,613
- Sure.
- Thank you.

794
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,650
Thank you
and I'm sorry about all this.

795
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:50,317
But, um,

796
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,319
yeah. Goodbye, again.

797
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,921
Yeah. Goodbye.

798
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,222
Forever.

799
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:07,935
Okay, I just,
I'd have to leave by 8:00.

800
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,872
Yes! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

801
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:12,750
- Thank you, thank you.
- It's okay. All right.

802
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,509
- Thank you, thank you.
- Yes, yes.

803
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,286
How are you gonna explain
bringing me to this wedding?

804
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm not. You'll be Kip.

805
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:21,348
Wait, you want me to pretend
to be the dick who just left?

806
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:23,985
Please.
It'll just be so much easier.

807
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,420
And you could leave as soon
as the ceremony's done.

808
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:27,955
Please,
you'll be saving my life.

809
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,958
Does Kip have a job?

810
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:32,459
Of course, you have a job.

811
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,394
I wouldn't date
a complete loser.

812
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:35,572
You're a commercial contractor.

813
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:36,964
You own your own company.

814
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,542
Okay, well, I don't
really know anything about

815
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:41,002
being a contractor
because I'm a lawyer.

816
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,503
Oh, perfect.

817
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,872
Don't you guys basically lie
for a living?

818
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,974
Here, you can use mine.

819
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:53,114
This is a 42 long.
I'm a 40.

820
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:54,381
It's Armani.

821
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:55,850
Just keep your hands
in the pockets.

822
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:59,187
Wait,
so if no one's met him yet,

823
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:00,855
then why can't
I just be a lawyer?

824
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:02,566
Because they already know
he's a contractor.

825
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,758
Oh, and a black belt.

826
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:05,392
- He's a black belt?
- Yeah, but relax.

827
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:06,570
It's not like
you're getting into a fight

828
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:07,829
at my sister's wedding.

829
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:10,031
So, how long
have you guys been dating?

830
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,701
Had been. Almost three months.

831
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,870
Wait, three months

832
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:17,404
and not a single person
in your life

833
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:18,472
has met your boyfriend?

834
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,273
He was busy. People are busy.

835
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,242
Can we dispense
with the Twenty Questions?

836
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:24,712
I need a zip.

837
00:37:25,146 --> 00:37:26,614
Oh, yeah.

838
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,749
Okay.

839
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:39,560
I'm Margot, by the way.

840
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:40,828
Griffin.

841
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:43,497
Griffin?
Wait, your name is Griffin?

842
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,600
Yes, like the mythical creature.

843
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,035
Part lion, part bird. I know.

844
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,576
Uh...

845
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,814
- We gotta go, gotta go.
- Yes, yes, yes.

846
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,850
- Okay. Oh.
- Okay.

847
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:06,158
Wait. Hold on. I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

848
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,998
Yeah, you're forgetting
this isn't your house.

849
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,389
- Come on!
- Okay.

850
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,360
Oh, come on.

851
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:15,763
Come on, come on, come on,
baby, come on.

852
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,297
Come on, come on, come on.

853
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,533
Yes!

854
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,934
Uh, wait, should I drive?

855
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:22,603
You know, that is
such a man thing to say.

856
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,848
Like I'm incapable of starting
the car because I'm a woman

857
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,074
and it happens to be
sub-zero temperatures outside?

858
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:28,276
Good one.

859
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:30,945
Or, perhaps because a DUI
will literally ruin your life.

860
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:32,747
And I at least had a nap.

861
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:34,816
Oh.

862
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:37,251
Well, that's actually
very sweet.

863
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,619
- Switch?
- Yeah, please.

864
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,597
No! Well, hold on. I'm gonna
go around. I'm going around.

865
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:41,923
Around, around.

866
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,759
Jeez!

867
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:47,494
We need caffeine.

868
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:48,896
Wait, are you sure we have time?

869
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:50,803
Yeah, there's always time
for coffee, let's go.

870
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,777
All right, do you
want to tell me what happened

871
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:55,570
with, uh,
Mr. Armani back there?

872
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,939
It's a long story.
Not that interesting.

873
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,574
Well, you know,
if it's any consolation,

874
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,543
I'm pretty sure you dodged
a bullet back there.

875
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:04,679
What about you?

876
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:08,015
Did you dodge a bullet with
Miss Ginger Spice America?

877
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,918
Her name is Clementine.

878
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,687
Clementine?

879
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:15,756
Wow. It's not a name,
it's a tricky fruit.

880
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:17,457
Tricky fruit? What is that?

881
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,294
Tricky. Fake, looks all sweet
on the outside,

882
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,563
all bright and orange.

883
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,766
Then you peel it,
it's this dry sour pith.

884
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,339
No. My...
My Clementine is great.

885
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:33,641
Hmm. Great.

886
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:38,045
I thought you guys broke up.

887
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,249
What? No, why...
why would you say that?

888
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:42,750
Oh, um...

889
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,553
'Cause she, you know,

890
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,356
fled Bennigan's, stole my Uber.

891
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:50,057
Plus, you're on a date with me.

892
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:52,627
We're not on a date.
I mean, this is a favor.

893
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:56,264
Yeah, I mean,

894
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:59,767
you know, you're on a favor
with me. So...

895
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,502
Mm...

896
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:05,273
You know, I get it, it's fine.
You don't even know me.

897
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,742
Let's just get this over with.

898
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:09,944
Oh, it's left here.

899
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:12,280
- Here. Here, here, here!
- Left where? Here? Jeez!

900
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:18,819
Are you trying to kill us?

901
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:20,788
A little notice next time.

902
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,962
Why does it look like
the lights are out?

903
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,331
- The sign says closed.
- No, no, no, no,

904
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:31,999
this cannot be happening! No!

905
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,501
I can't believe
they closed early.

906
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,007
I mean, how could
they do this to me?

907
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:37,038
Well, you wanted
to stop for coffee, so...

908
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:39,240
I'm bringing a stranger
to my sister's wedding.

909
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:41,976
Do I look like I make
good decisions under pressure?

910
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,211
Let's break in.

911
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:46,380
- Wait, what now?
- I cannot show up

912
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,791
without the veil.
I will be disowned

913
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:49,535
- after they kill me!
- Where are you going?

914
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:52,253
Oh! I can climb
on this and go in that window.

915
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,855
Oh, my, God, are you crazy?
Burglary is a felony.

916
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,934
What do you suggest? I don't
think there's a spare key

917
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,259
hiding under the flower pot.

918
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,995
Plus, it's not stealing if
it's your own property. So...

919
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:02,739
Um, actually, it's called
breaking and entering.

920
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:04,541
And you can get up to
three months in county jail.

921
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:07,268
- Oh. Well, that's doable.
- Oh, my God.

922
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:09,971
Come on, it's just a veil.

923
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,340
- Hmm?
- Well...

924
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,008
Sorry, what? "Just a veil"?

925
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:16,677
Well, yeah. I mean, it's just
like a piece of fabric, right?

926
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,112
So, can't she just,
I don't know,

927
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,247
find something else?
Like a towel or a sheet?

928
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:23,117
Okay. You want
my sister to get married

929
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,986
with a sheet
wrapped around her head?

930
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:26,721
A pretty sheet?

931
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:29,590
Okay, just move.

932
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,659
Okay, there's nothing
you can say

933
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:33,006
that's gonna
talk me out of this.

934
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:34,671
No, I'm saying you're not
tall enough to get up there.

935
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:36,831
So, just move. Let me do it.

936
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,533
Oh. Okay.

937
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,802
Thank you.

938
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,907
Hmm, all right. This is...

939
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:52,747
Okay. All right, here.

940
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:53,857
- Let me, let me help you.
- No.

941
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:56,150
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

942
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:59,487
- Oh! Sorry, okay. Okay. Okay.
- Yes. Yeah.

943
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:03,324
Here we go, okay, okay.
Okay. Here we go.

944
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,992
- Almost. Yeah.
- Go. Go.

945
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,329
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, that's my head.

946
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,600
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

947
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,235
Oh! Shit!

948
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:15,536
Okay,

949
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:16,904
uh, what do I do?

950
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:19,006
- What do I do?
- Just meet me around front.

951
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:19,940
Okay.

952
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:22,243
Wait, wait, wait.

953
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,677
What's your sister's name?

954
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:26,180
Carrie. Carrie Hayes.

955
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,883
- Yeah. Oh, shit!
- Shit.

956
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:33,387
- I have the veil! Ha-ha! Yeah.
- My hero!

957
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:35,589
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

958
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:37,992
Oh, perfect.

959
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,693
- All right, let's go.
- Let's do it.

960
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,028
Oh, wait, one second.

961
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:42,496
Wait, what are you doing?

962
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,764
I have to leave some money

963
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:45,866
because I, uh,
broke a display case.

964
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:48,302
I'm a fugitive
with Mother Teresa.

965
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,737
Okay.

966
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,640
All righty. Do it.

967
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:00,714
No. No, no, no, no, no. No!

968
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:02,249
Don't panic, no.
It's just cold.

969
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,555
- And dead.
- Try again.

970
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,656
- Try again, try again.
- Come on, baby.

971
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:13,260
No!

972
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:21,769
Come on, Uber!

973
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:24,171
Well, someone has to
come by eventually.

974
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,544
Carrie was right.
I am gonna ruin her wedding.

975
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,911
Well, I mean, listen,

976
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:31,988
if two people are destined
to be together,

977
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,681
then nothing can ruin it.

978
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:35,550
You don't know my sister.

979
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,936
She would call
the whole thing off

980
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:38,553
just so she could
hold it over my head

981
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:39,820
for the rest of our lives.

982
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:41,622
I'd say you guys
don't really get along.

983
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,491
No, we do.

984
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:44,959
We're just different.

985
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,361
Her life is perfectly planned
and executed

986
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:48,662
down to the last detail,

987
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:52,633
and I ate expired yogurt
for lunch.

988
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,668
Wait, that yogurt was expired?

989
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:56,303
Jesus!

990
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,905
Ever since we were kids,

991
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,050
Carrie made me feel like
I could never live up to her.

992
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,475
So, I didn't bother trying.

993
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:04,411
- Okay. So, it's her fault.
- I'm not saying that.

994
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,181
Okay, maybe I am saying that.

995
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:09,092
I bet you don't know
what it's like

996
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:11,485
to be a constant
disappointment to your family.

997
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:13,888
No, but I am like an only child

998
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,956
to the world's happiest,
happy couple ever.

999
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:17,958
Wow, does Social Services know?

1000
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:19,760
Okay. No, I'm serious though.

1001
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,328
It's like the bar
is already so high.

1002
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:23,598
And then, I'm like
their sole purpose in life.

1003
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,941
So, I'm just excited
to get married,

1004
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:26,367
so they'll finally have,

1005
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,145
you know, someone else
to focus on for once.

1006
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:30,171
Oh, are you getting married
soon?

1007
00:44:30,237 --> 00:44:31,939
Well, I mean,
not tomorrow but...

1008
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:33,741
Go! Go!

1009
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,242
Hey! Wait!

1010
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,745
- Margot, wait!
- Whoa! Shit.

1011
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:41,815
- Excuse me!
- Margot!

1012
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:44,118
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Go!

1013
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:46,820
- Go! Go!
- Hello! Excuse me!

1014
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:47,888
- Margot, wait!
- Wait!

1015
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,456
- Driver?
- Hold on.

1016
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:50,991
- Driver!
- Wait.

1017
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:52,594
Whoa. Whoa.

1018
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:57,599
Hi! Thank you.
Thank you, our car broke down.

1019
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:00,801
My sister's getting married
tonight and I am so late.

1020
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,203
Okay.
I have got the boot,

1021
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,704
- Cinderella.
- Ooh, your shoe!

1022
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,072
Oh! My... My prince.

1023
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,150
- Yeah, yeah, just...
- He's harmless, he's with me.

1024
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,351
- Oh, oh. Thank you, okay...
- Put your foot in here.

1025
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,743
- ...I got it.
- Well, come on up!

1026
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,945
- Really?
- Yes.

1027
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,213
- Cool.
- Thank you.

1028
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:13,814
Hotel's like three miles away,

1029
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:14,958
so, you know, we were
actually just gonna walk.

1030
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,383
But this is probably better.

1031
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,319
Ooh, you're saving
our lives. Seriously.

1032
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,924
So, what brings
you both out tonight?

1033
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:25,426
It's our anniversary.

1034
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:27,696
Always take my bride to dinner
on New Year's Eve.

1035
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:28,762
Aw!

1036
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:29,897
Happy anniversary!

1037
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:31,398
Fifty-eight years.

1038
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:34,401
And he is still the most
romantic man I ever met.

1039
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:38,506
Fifty-eight years?
That's incredible!

1040
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:39,974
So is your coat, by the way.

1041
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,976
Ooh, this is my lucky coat.

1042
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,812
I met the man of my dreams
because of this coat.

1043
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:46,046
Because of the coat?

1044
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:47,616
Sounds like
there's a story there.

1045
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:49,517
Go on, dear. You tell it.

1046
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:50,851
Oh, they don't want to hear

1047
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,687
how a couple old coots met
50 years ago.

1048
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,073
- Yes, we do!
- What? Yeah, we do.

1049
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,923
- We definitely want to hear.
- Please.

1050
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,692
Well,

1051
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:00,194
it was a drizzly,
gray October morning.

1052
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:02,029
I was taking the ferry
over to Manhattan

1053
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:04,064
to meet my buddy, Hank,
for lunch.

1054
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:06,000
So, the ferry pulls
into the port

1055
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:09,203
and I see this beautiful girl

1056
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,772
wearing a carnation pink coat.

1057
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,208
I was love-struck, frozen.

1058
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,943
When I finally
got my legs to move,

1059
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,811
I chased after her
but lost her in the crowd.

1060
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,222
- Wait, you lost her?
- You lost her?

1061
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:22,082
I was crushed. I figured
I'd go see a matinee.

1062
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:24,586
So, I walked over
to the Astor on Broadway.

1063
00:46:24,653 --> 00:46:25,853
And would you believe it?

1064
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,821
Who walks in
and sits one seat over?

1065
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,491
But the girl
in the carnation pink coat.

1066
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:32,661
- Come on!
- No way!

1067
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:34,061
So, the movie ends

1068
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:35,606
and I follow her into
the lobby and ask her,

1069
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,633
would she like to go
have a piece of pie with me?

1070
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,067
- She said, "No."
- "No"?

1071
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,435
I had plans.

1072
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:42,870
To meet my cousin.

1073
00:46:42,936 --> 00:46:44,204
So, I asked her,

1074
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,750
"Would you please
give me your phone number?

1075
00:46:45,774 --> 00:46:47,207
"And I'll call you tomorrow."

1076
00:46:47,274 --> 00:46:51,178
Again, she said, "No."
Turned and walked out.

1077
00:46:51,245 --> 00:46:53,414
- Oh, no.
- You just walked away?

1078
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,116
Give a strange man
my phone number?

1079
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:58,052
My mother would've had my hide.

1080
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,920
So, I go to meet my buddy, Hank,

1081
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,856
over at Stardust Diner
on 52nd Street.

1082
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:07,461
<i>I walked in,
and would you believe it?</i>

1083
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:09,296
<i>Draped over the back
of the booth</i>

1084
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:12,299
<i>was a carnation pink coat.</i>

1085
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:28,550
- That was that.
- Mm.

1086
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,518
Two months later, we eloped.

1087
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,920
And that was
58 years ago tonight.

1088
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:35,422
Simply, a matter of fate.

1089
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,294
Wow! That's a beautiful story.

1090
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,565
Nothing like that
would ever happen on Tinder.

1091
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:46,934
I mean, not that I'm on Tinder.

1092
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,169
Our son is gonna pick us up.

1093
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,413
Why don't you folks
keep the carriage

1094
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:51,757
- for the rest of the night?
- Oh.

1095
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:52,906
- Really?
- Are you serious?

1096
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,341
That would be amazing.

1097
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:57,044
Whoa.

1098
00:47:57,111 --> 00:47:59,213
Here we are, folks.

1099
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:01,048
Happy anniversary.

1100
00:48:01,115 --> 00:48:02,950
Go on, dear. You take this.

1101
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:04,519
Oh, no, no, no. I can't.

1102
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:07,589
A pretty girl like you
can't be going to a wedding

1103
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:09,557
in such an ugly coat.

1104
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:11,158
Uh...

1105
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:14,228
Well, it's your lucky coat.
I wouldn't feel right.

1106
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:17,866
Dear, when the universe hands
you a gift, you don't say no.

1107
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:21,669
Well, okay.
Only if you take mine.

1108
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,573
- Look at that!
- Thank you.

1109
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:27,908
Well.

1110
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:29,588
- Lovely meeting you.
- He's a keeper.

1111
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:35,315
Oh, um...

1112
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:36,851
- What was the movie?
- Sorry, son?

1113
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:39,953
The matinee at the Astor.
You know, the day you two met.

1114
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,657
Ah! Audrey Hepburn.

1115
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:44,826
<i>- Breakfast at Tiffany's.
- Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

1116
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:46,160
Still our favorite.

1117
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,798
Wow.

1118
00:48:50,397 --> 00:48:51,575
Will you take this
and just make sure

1119
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,367
you pay for that couple's meal.

1120
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,044
I'll just come by
in the morning to grab it.

1121
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:56,203
Thank you so much.

1122
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,572
What did you just do?

1123
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,440
Oh, I just gave him
my credit card.

1124
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:01,107
I thought we should
treat them to dinner.

1125
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,845
You just gave a stranger
your credit card?

1126
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:06,032
Yeah, it's fine. I'll just
come get it in the morning.

1127
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,381
It's not a big deal.

1128
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:44,284
- Easy.
- Ah. Here we are.

1129
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:46,031
All right. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1130
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,488
Thank you so much, Sir.
Sorry, move.

1131
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:48,890
I'm coming with you.

1132
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:50,925
Thank you so much.
Happy New Year.

1133
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,326
Happy New Year.

1134
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:54,294
- Thank you.
- Ah, thank you so much.

1135
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:58,432
Okay. So, Dad is Paul.
Mom is Judy.

1136
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,668
Remember, you build stuff
and you adore me.

1137
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,436
I have to get this veil
to my sister, okay?

1138
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:03,872
- Okay.
- Oh, hi, aunties!

1139
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:06,373
- Oh. Oh. Yes. Wait, Margot.
- This must be Kip!

1140
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,576
I'm glad you're here.
Sheila, Rita.

1141
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:12,412
Okay. Just make sure
that the buttons

1142
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,924
are all lined up perfectly,
thank you.

1143
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,158
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1144
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,150
- I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!
- Oh!

1145
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:19,186
You are two hours late!

1146
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:20,420
Yeah, we got the veil.

1147
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:22,991
- "We"? Is Kip here?
- Yes, Kip is here.

1148
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,092
- Oh.
- You guys have no faith in me.

1149
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,294
Where are your shoes?

1150
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:31,265
Um, Fourth Avenue.

1151
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,767
No, no, no, no, no.

1152
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,269
You cannot wear dirty
winter boots down the aisle.

1153
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:36,871
- Um...
- Mom?

1154
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:39,807
Well, you could always wear
your grandmother's shoes.

1155
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:44,444
- Cute.
- No.

1156
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:46,146
I knew you were
gonna ruin the wedding.

1157
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:47,682
I think you are
an absolute disaster!

1158
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:50,919
Well, you know
what's not a disaster? You.

1159
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:52,419
Okay? You look amazing.

1160
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:55,289
And it's fine, I'll find Dana
and wear her shoes.

1161
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:56,624
Everything will be fine.

1162
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,192
Let's just get this veil on you.

1163
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,629
Let's get you all situated.

1164
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:03,565
- Then just...
- Yeah, I got you.

1165
00:51:03,631 --> 00:51:04,899
- That's right.
- Here we go.

1166
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:09,771
Okay, come on.
You look stunning!

1167
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,639
I'm really glad you're here.

1168
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,273
I'm so sorry I was late.

1169
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,075
It was just a debacle,
the whole thing.

1170
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:16,978
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Evening, ladies.

1171
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,748
Back-up wedding planner
at your service.

1172
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:21,983
I'm Flour.

1173
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,685
Not like the bouquet,

1174
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:25,720
like the grain.

1175
00:51:25,787 --> 00:51:27,555
I'm sorry, are you high?

1176
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:28,957
Meh.

1177
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,726
Little bit.

1178
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,293
Oh! Maybe a lot.

1179
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,605
- No, no, no.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1180
00:51:34,629 --> 00:51:35,706
- No, no, it's not okay.
- It's all right.

1181
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:36,764
No, no, I'm freaking out.

1182
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,933
- You want a hit?
- Oh, I'd love one. Thanks.

1183
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,736
After the wedding maybe. Um...

1184
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:43,071
Cool, cool.

1185
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:44,982
All right, gonna go find Dana
for those shoes. So...

1186
00:51:45,006 --> 00:51:46,349
- Please.
- Oh, I want to go with you

1187
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:47,685
because I want to meet
this Kip character.

1188
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,085
No. Mom, please,
there's not enough time and,

1189
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,344
you know, Kip is nervous.

1190
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:52,355
He doesn't need my whole
family pawing all over him.

1191
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:53,815
Do you have...?

1192
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,325
Nobody's gonna be pawing
all over him. It's ridiculous.

1193
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:56,584
- I just...
- Yeah.

1194
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:57,795
That doesn't make...
Wait for me.

1195
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:58,987
Hell, yes. Rita, you can

1196
00:51:59,152 --> 00:52:01,288
knock down a pony wall
without a permit. No problem.

1197
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:02,724
What about the electrical?

1198
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:04,324
Just pull it.

1199
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:06,537
Just take it out. Come on,
Paul, just pull that shit.

1200
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:07,595
Isn't that dangerous?

1201
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:09,063
I mean, yeah, if you're, like,

1202
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:10,489
standing in a bathtub
or something.

1203
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:12,734
Oh, man, I love this guy.

1204
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,168
Hey, dude, marry Margot
so we can be bros.

1205
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:16,346
- Whoa!
- And you can teach me

1206
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,939
all your moves, right? Hyah!

1207
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,574
Oh, oh, careful.
I'm dangerous.

1208
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:21,375
You're a martial arts guy too?

1209
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:24,311
- I mean, I dabble, you know?
- Oh!

1210
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:25,698
- For the cardio mostly.
- Dabble?

1211
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:27,414
The dude's like
a third-degree black belt.

1212
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:30,051
Third, fourth. It's like,
who's counting at this point?

1213
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:31,351
Dude!

1214
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:32,630
Well, for months, all I've heard

1215
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:33,897
is Kip, Kip, Kip.
I want to meet Kip.

1216
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:35,188
Okay, Mom, you're being crazy.

1217
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,391
- So, tone it down and I'll...
- Kip is here?

1218
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:39,727
- Yes. That's him, right there.
- Uh, Kip.

1219
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:40,795
Not much to look at

1220
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:42,106
- but seems nice.
- Kip. Hey, Kip.

1221
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,731
- Hey, Kip. Kip? Kip.
- Oh.

1222
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:45,133
- Yeah, hi.
- That's Kip?

1223
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:46,598
Yes, that's
Margot's boyfriend, Kip.

1224
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:47,811
Yeah, sorry. I wanted
you to meet my mother.

1225
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:49,369
Um, this is my mom, Judy.

1226
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:50,972
- Oh, my gosh.
- Dying to meet you.

1227
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,719
Hello, I've been dying
to meet you as well.

1228
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:55,308
- The black belt?
- Uh, I guess.

1229
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:56,778
Hold my purse.

1230
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:58,946
Excuse me.

1231
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:01,849
How dare you show up here?

1232
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:05,218
You are a sorry excuse
for a man! Kip!

1233
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:06,554
I'm sorry.

1234
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,499
Not the reflexes I'd expect
from a black belt.

1235
00:53:08,523 --> 00:53:10,792
Hey, Dana, stop.
This is not Kip.

1236
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,493
- Hmm?
- I mean... I mean...

1237
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:15,295
this is... this is...
this is not the...

1238
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:16,597
the Kip you thought he was.

1239
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:19,534
He's apologized
for doing that thing

1240
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,502
- that you're so mad about.
- Stop it.

1241
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:23,137
You mean, dumping you?

1242
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:25,238
You dumped my daughter?

1243
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,541
Dude!

1244
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:29,577
I did...

1245
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:30,644
Uh...

1246
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:32,947
- Not? I didn't.
- He... He...

1247
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:34,481
He didn't.

1248
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:37,518
See, I... I thought he did,
but it was a misunderstanding.

1249
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:39,319
Yeah. Happens.

1250
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,455
How can you be confused
about being dumped?

1251
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:42,957
- Um...
- Ooh...

1252
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:44,125
Texting, Mother.

1253
00:53:44,192 --> 00:53:45,492
Oh, yeah.
It was the text.

1254
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,961
- It was a wrong text.
- Yeah.

1255
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,706
- It was an emoji thing.
- Yeah, you got it.

1256
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,798
Hey! Who's ready
to get married?

1257
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:53,067
- That's me. Hi. That's me.
- Oh! Right on.

1258
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:56,202
Okay, you all saw that, right?

1259
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,872
Ooh, poltergeist.

1260
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,144
So, are you sure it's okay
that I'm sitting this close?

1261
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,377
Oh, don't be silly.

1262
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,147
- You're practically family.
- Okay.

1263
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,151
Mm. Thanks.

1264
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:20,962
Sorry.

1265
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:26,466
I thought they were

1266
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:28,335
supposed to wear
matching dresses.

1267
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:06,174
Oh-ho, that's a good sign.

1268
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:08,276
- What's happening?
- Honey, it's okay.

1269
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:09,581
I'm sure it's just the weather.

1270
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,512
The lights will be on soon.

1271
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:12,780
Sorry, folks!

1272
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:14,447
Lights won't be back
anytime soon.

1273
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:17,084
Power lines are freezing up.

1274
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:18,485
And we just blew a generator.

1275
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:20,353
You...
You don't have a backup?

1276
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:22,557
Uh, this was our backup.

1277
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,863
We've got a team working on it.

1278
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:25,502
I just don't know
how long it's gonna take.

1279
00:55:25,526 --> 00:55:28,196
- Daddy?
- No, not to worry, honey.

1280
00:55:28,596 --> 00:55:31,098
I'll get you to the altar.
It's plenty bright.

1281
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,465
No, no, no, no, no.

1282
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:34,235
I can't walk down the aisle
in blue light.

1283
00:55:34,302 --> 00:55:35,903
I'll look like a zombie bride.

1284
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,506
- A beautiful zombie bride.
- Aw.

1285
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:40,508
Maybe, we can get some candles?

1286
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:41,976
You know, just like

1287
00:55:42,043 --> 00:55:43,687
- a few hundred or...
- That's a great idea.

1288
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:45,780
Sorry, folks.
Building fire codes.

1289
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:49,584
We've got an expert builder
right here in the family.

1290
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,819
Kip knows all about
fire codes. Don't you, Kip?

1291
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:54,487
- Uh...
- Yeah, bro. What can we do?

1292
00:55:54,856 --> 00:55:56,858
Um...

1293
00:55:57,758 --> 00:55:59,359
- How about oranges?
- Huh?

1294
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,828
Oranges, sir?

1295
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:02,964
Yeah, I mean, oranges aren't
against code, right?

1296
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,132
- Huh.
- Where's your kitchen?

1297
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:06,734
Okay, I need some olive oil,

1298
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:07,935
a couple of kitchen scissors

1299
00:56:08,002 --> 00:56:09,436
and a couple of mops, all right?

1300
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:11,038
You three start
cutting these in half.

1301
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:13,507
And then, you start helping me
scoop out the flesh. Okay?

1302
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:15,408
Is this a Clementine thing?

1303
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:16,777
Actually,

1304
00:56:16,844 --> 00:56:18,346
it's an orange thing.
Just trust me.

1305
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:20,548
You're obsessed
with citrus fruit.

1306
00:56:24,652 --> 00:56:25,853
No, we'll save it for later.

1307
00:56:26,254 --> 00:56:28,089
- Get these over to them.
- Do you need more?

1308
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,458
- Grab a new mop.
- Ah, great, thanks.

1309
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,161
Yeah. Just start
cutting some more wicks.

1310
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:36,697
Yeah, right here.
On the top. I'll get it.

1311
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,735
How do you know how to do this?

1312
00:56:40,902 --> 00:56:43,137
Well, I once defended
a vegan chef for stalking.

1313
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:44,404
She was guilty as hell,

1314
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,782
but she taught me
how to make candles.

1315
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:48,242
And my spelt muffins are to die!

1316
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:49,744
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1317
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,913
- All right.
- Yeah, try lighting a couple.

1318
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:53,446
- All right.
- Here you go.

1319
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,183
Hey!

1320
00:56:57,518 --> 00:56:58,552
This is great!

1321
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:59,887
Thanks.

1322
00:57:14,936 --> 00:57:16,504
We did it!

1323
00:57:17,672 --> 00:57:18,940
- Hey, this guy!
- Congrats!

1324
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:20,608
Look at you, saving the wedding!

1325
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:22,910
- Wow! Amazing.
- I'm married!

1326
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:32,653
- Kip!
- I know!

1327
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,288
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1328
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:37,625
I know, he's the best.
One second.

1329
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:39,827
Hi, can we play the other song?

1330
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:41,862
The one we talked about?
Thank you.

1331
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,764
I'm gonna come find you.

1332
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:45,032
- Okay. Yeah.
- Have a drink.

1333
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:46,133
Have so much fun.

1334
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:51,272
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1335
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:53,140
My sister is so happy.

1336
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:54,342
And, I mean,

1337
00:57:54,408 --> 00:57:55,876
you saved the wedding.

1338
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:57,611
Oh, no, you're so welcome.

1339
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:58,958
I mean, I'm just glad it worked.

1340
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:00,281
I've never tried that before.

1341
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:01,391
- Yeah, right.
- No, I'm serious.

1342
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:02,750
Stop.

1343
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,154
- Well...
- Well...

1344
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:12,538
It's probably time
for you to go, huh?

1345
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,595
Yeah.

1346
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:17,131
But we should, uh, toast
the newlyweds, right?

1347
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:18,199
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1348
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:20,010
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude
if Kip didn't.

1349
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,369
Of course, yeah.

1350
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:23,442
I'm gonna go get
some champagne. Be right back.

1351
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:30,244
Okay, Mata Hari,

1352
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:31,846
who's the imposter?

1353
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:35,282
Just some guy I met tonight.

1354
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,119
Tinder? Hinge?

1355
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:40,721
- Christian Mingle?
- No! I, uh...

1356
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,191
I walked into my apartment
and he was in my bed.

1357
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:47,795
- Are you medicated?
- We have the same address.

1358
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:49,673
You know, I keep a spare key
under the flower pot,

1359
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:51,465
it's a very long story.

1360
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:56,537
So, this random hot man
appears in your bed

1361
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:58,372
and agrees to play
your ex-boyfriend

1362
00:58:58,439 --> 00:58:59,940
at your sister's wedding?

1363
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,610
You think he's hot?

1364
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,781
I'm putting out
a spare key tonight.

1365
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:09,884
Nice to meet you, Kip.

1366
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:13,387
Hello, Veronica.
Small world.

1367
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:14,588
You know, it's funny.

1368
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,291
You look just like
a public defender I know.

1369
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:20,728
But he's about to be engaged
to a redhead mattress model.

1370
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:23,898
Yeah, I'm, uh, just here
helping out a friend.

1371
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:26,967
Oh! Pretty friend.

1372
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,803
Future fiancé
must really trust you.

1373
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,404
Yeah, actually she does.

1374
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,073
But, um, I would appreciate it

1375
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:34,543
if you could keep this
between us.

1376
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:36,577
Yeah. Absolutely.

1377
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:39,680
Congratulations,
sister. You did it.

1378
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:41,849
Love you, sister.

1379
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:44,952
And Kip is amazing!

1380
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:47,354
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1381
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,622
Thank you.

1382
00:59:48,689 --> 00:59:50,958
Who is that,
that Kip is talking to?

1383
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:52,660
That's, um...

1384
00:59:52,726 --> 00:59:55,262
It's Brian's Aunty V.

1385
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:58,099
Wait. You gave away
my plus one?

1386
00:59:58,165 --> 00:59:59,805
Yeah, but you weren't
answering your phone

1387
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,344
and I thought that you were
just gonna flake on me

1388
01:00:01,368 --> 01:00:03,104
like you always do. So...

1389
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:05,306
Nice.

1390
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:06,874
So, you want us
to share the halibut?

1391
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:08,843
Yeah, we'll get you
some extra bread.

1392
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,344
That's...

1393
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:11,912
That's gross.

1394
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:16,551
You're staying for dinner.
You're staying for dinner.

1395
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,895
I promise it's the last thing
I'll ask of you this evening.

1396
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,254
But you have to stay for dinner.

1397
01:00:20,321 --> 01:00:21,321
Okay. Okay.

1398
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:22,799
- Okay, you're gonna stay? Yes?
- Okay. Yeah, no.

1399
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:23,824
- Yes.
- I beg.

1400
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,292
Yeah, please, just let me...

1401
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:26,494
Okay, but you're gonna stay?

1402
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:27,838
- Yes, of course.
- You're gonna stay.

1403
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:29,172
- Promise? Okay.
- Yeah, just let me...

1404
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:30,240
Okay, no, okay, but you're
gonna stay, yeah?

1405
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,765
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

1406
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,234
Hey, Clem!

1407
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,702
<i>Did you just hang up on me?</i>

1408
01:00:34,768 --> 01:00:36,170
What? No, no, no.
Of course not.

1409
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,781
Sorry, there is just
bad reception here.

1410
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:39,406
<i>Bad reception?
Where are you?</i>

1411
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:42,009
Uh, well, like I said,
I had to make a quick stop,

1412
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:44,145
and then
I'll explain everything...

1413
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:46,280
Hello?

1414
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,316
Ooh.

1415
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:52,920
Hey, sweetie.

1416
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:55,524
<i>"Sweetie"? It's almost 9:00.</i>

1417
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,633
<i>Where the hell are you, Griffin?</i>

1418
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:57,825
Kip? Kip, Kip, Kip.

1419
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,269
- Time for pictures.
- Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll be

1420
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:00,828
- right over there. Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

1421
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:03,297
<i>- I'm sorry. Was that a bride?</i>
- Uh, yes.

1422
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:05,299
<i>Your quick stop
was at a wedding?</i>

1423
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:06,400
Um...

1424
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:07,502
Sort of. Yeah.

1425
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:09,538
<i>Whose wedding? And who is Kip?</i>

1426
01:01:09,604 --> 01:01:11,972
Oh. Uh, me. I'm Kip.

1427
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,407
It's, um...
It's just a nickname.

1428
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:14,914
<i>I've never heard
anyone call you Kip.</i>

1429
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,353
Really? 'Cause, uh,
back in college...

1430
01:01:16,377 --> 01:01:17,444
Kip!

1431
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:18,655
...all my law school buddies
was like...

1432
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:19,880
Come on! Pictures!

1433
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:21,291
Yeah, just give me
one second, okay?

1434
01:01:21,315 --> 01:01:22,249
No, no, no. Come...

1435
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:23,827
Because I have to finish
this call, okay?

1436
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,195
<i>- That was a law school buddy?</i>
- Um...

1437
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,588
<i>And Griffin,
what are you wearing?</i>

1438
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,955
<i>That's not the suit I got you.</i>

1439
01:01:28,122 --> 01:01:29,799
Kip, we gotta talk
manufactured siding at dinner.

1440
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:31,091
- Table 14.
- And we will.

1441
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:32,702
I promise you,
I'll be right there. Okay?

1442
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:34,094
Just gotta wrap this up, okay?

1443
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,930
<i>I'm sorry,
are you staying for dinner?</i>

1444
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,965
<i>Griffin, we had a deal.</i>

1445
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,733
Um, yeah, I know.
Listen, Clem.

1446
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,603
This friend is having
a family emergency.

1447
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,313
And they just, they really,
really need my help.

1448
01:01:43,337 --> 01:01:45,339
<i>Is this some kind
of genetic defect?</i>

1449
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:48,776
<i>You never say no to anyone.
Except for me.</i>

1450
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,778
No, look,
I'm really sorry, okay?

1451
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,246
You're gonna have to go on

1452
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:53,857
and then I'll meet you there
at the party late...

1453
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:54,915
Kip. Come on.

1454
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:56,217
We're all waiting for you.

1455
01:01:56,283 --> 01:01:57,885
Oh, you know,
I really don't need

1456
01:01:57,952 --> 01:01:59,129
to be in the wedding pictures.

1457
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:01,656
Nonsense.
You're practically family.

1458
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:02,957
I'm really not.

1459
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:04,358
Come on.

1460
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:08,896
Yeah, yeah, that's sweet.

1461
01:02:10,264 --> 01:02:11,799
Oh, Margot.
Kip, Kip, Kip. Come on in.

1462
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:13,076
- Oh, God, no, he's fine.
- Dude. Dude.

1463
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,411
Do we, like, stick
our tongue out?

1464
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:16,035
- We're like, "Ahh!"
- Maybe less tongue.

1465
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:17,404
<i>Let's do it!</i>

1466
01:02:17,471 --> 01:02:18,673
One, two, three.

1467
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:19,807
And we jump!

1468
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,644
<i>- I was early.
- Okay.</i>

1469
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,877
I want to pinch your cheeks.

1470
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:25,224
I just want
to pinch your cheeks.

1471
01:02:26,447 --> 01:02:27,915
One, two...

1472
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:30,251
Here we go. One, two, three.

1473
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,520
<i>Just us, just men.</i>

1474
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:41,161
Oh, that was so much fun,
you guys.

1475
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:42,640
- You already got me...
- No, no. No.

1476
01:02:42,664 --> 01:02:44,064
So sweet!

1477
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,038
- Kip.
- Come here, come here.

1478
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,705
- Jump in.
- Get in the edge. Just there.

1479
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:57,177
<i>So, here's to food poisoning.</i>

1480
01:02:57,344 --> 01:02:59,113
If I hadn't gotten
those bad clams

1481
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,148
and ended up
in the emergency room,

1482
01:03:01,215 --> 01:03:04,952
I wouldn't have met
the hottest nurse in town

1483
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,588
when I was at my very worst.

1484
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:08,690
Well, he was green.

1485
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:11,492
And adorable.

1486
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:14,596
- To food poisoning and fate!
- Yeah!

1487
01:03:15,195 --> 01:03:17,931
And thank you to everyone
for coming out tonight.

1488
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:20,067
It's always been my dream

1489
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:22,002
to get married
on New Year's Eve.

1490
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:25,039
And, um, to my parents
for footin' the bill.

1491
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:27,341
It's coming out
of your inheritance.

1492
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:29,443
- Dad!
- And to my maid of honor,

1493
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:30,844
my sister.

1494
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:33,247
Who will be late
to her own funeral

1495
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:35,015
but who really
came through for me

1496
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,651
when I needed her the most.

1497
01:03:36,718 --> 01:03:37,951
Aw.

1498
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,389
And to Kip, who until tonight,
let's face it,

1499
01:03:42,456 --> 01:03:44,793
I don't think any of us
believed you existed.

1500
01:03:44,892 --> 01:03:46,293
I know.

1501
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,564
But who really saved
the wedding.

1502
01:03:49,631 --> 01:03:52,266
- Kip, Kip, Kip, Kip.
- Kip, Kip, Kip, Kip.

1503
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,943
- Okay. Oh, stop.
- No, stop. Stop, stop. Okay.

1504
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:55,869
- Speech.
- Kip, Kip, Kip, Kip.

1505
01:03:55,936 --> 01:03:57,237
- Speech.
- No, no, no.

1506
01:03:57,304 --> 01:03:58,972
I mean,
I'm just happy I could help.

1507
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,342
I want to hear how you two met.

1508
01:04:01,408 --> 01:04:02,910
Ah! Me too.

1509
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:04,813
Ah, no. This is Carrie
and Brian's night.

1510
01:04:04,878 --> 01:04:06,013
You know? It's not about us.

1511
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,650
Yes, to Carrie and Brian!
Whoo!

1512
01:04:08,717 --> 01:04:10,427
- Oh, no. That's okay.
- It's all yours, bro.

1513
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:11,485
That's okay.

1514
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:13,521
All right.

1515
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:14,823
Okay.

1516
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:15,923
Okay.

1517
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:17,692
- How did we meet?
- How we met!

1518
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:20,829
Um... Well...

1519
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:29,203
It was a chilly,
gray October morning.

1520
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,574
And I was taking the ferry
into the city

1521
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,675
to meet a friend,

1522
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:35,376
when I looked down

1523
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:40,114
and I see the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen

1524
01:04:40,515 --> 01:04:43,183
in this incredible
carnation pink coat.

1525
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,753
She wore it tonight.

1526
01:04:44,952 --> 01:04:46,286
It's vintage.

1527
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:49,390
And I guess you could say
I caught her by surprise.

1528
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:51,125
Yes.

1529
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:53,661
And from that moment on, it's...

1530
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:56,463
it's been a non-stop adventure.

1531
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,833
I've scaled tall buildings,

1532
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:01,235
I've braved snow
by steed and carriage.

1533
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,470
I built fire and saved the day.

1534
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:08,375
When I'm with her, I just...

1535
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:11,579
...I feel like
I'm a superhero.

1536
01:05:12,346 --> 01:05:15,617
Let's just say that
from the moment we met,

1537
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,019
I felt like I was home.

1538
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:24,124
So, uh, to Margot!

1539
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,528
To Margot!

1540
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:29,096
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

1541
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:30,799
Jesus, that was amazing!

1542
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,901
Even if it was all bullshit.

1543
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:35,335
Most romantic bullshit
I ever heard.

1544
01:05:36,403 --> 01:05:38,038
That was an impressive speech,
Counselor.

1545
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:39,273
Mm.

1546
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:42,276
Thanks. It was
surprisingly effortless.

1547
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:44,712
- Hmm.
- Don't let this one get away.

1548
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:46,548
Real subtle, Dad.

1549
01:05:47,214 --> 01:05:50,384
But seriously, thank you.
I owe ya.

1550
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:52,587
Yeah, you do.

1551
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:08,937
Did you tell them to play this?

1552
01:06:09,002 --> 01:06:10,237
No, I didn't. I swear.

1553
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:12,005
- Come on.
- No.

1554
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:13,708
- Wow.
- Aw.

1555
01:06:15,108 --> 01:06:17,244
Don't forget
to email me that bid.

1556
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:19,012
Oh, yeah. You got it, Rita.

1557
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,649
Are you taking side jobs
with my aunts?

1558
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,686
Yeah, well, they're having
some foundation issues.

1559
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,186
- Mm.
- It's complicated.

1560
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:27,789
Contractor stuff.

1561
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:29,389
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1562
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,219
Margot.

1563
01:06:59,687 --> 01:07:00,722
Kip?

1564
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:03,190
Kip? I thought he was Kip.

1565
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:06,159
Well, don't look at me.

1566
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:07,671
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean,

1567
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:09,205
what am I doing here?
I texted you I was coming.

1568
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:10,565
Okay, I told you I blocked you.

1569
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:13,668
My God!
You look so beautiful, I...

1570
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,235
- Okay, okay.
- Listen, no, no, no.

1571
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,604
You ever heard of the saying,

1572
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:18,147
"You don't know what you have
till it's gone"?

1573
01:07:18,171 --> 01:07:19,215
Have you ever heard the saying,

1574
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:20,508
"Not the time or the place"?

1575
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:21,886
- I understand that.
- You need to leave.

1576
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,152
- Let me just talk to you.
- Look,

1577
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:24,736
this is so embarrassing.
You need to go.

1578
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,881
Sorry.

1579
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:29,116
Hold on.
Is he wearing my tuxedo?

1580
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:30,484
- Hey, come on.
- Margot.

1581
01:07:30,552 --> 01:07:31,451
She already asked you
to leave, all right?

1582
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:32,654
Is he wearing my tux?

1583
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,254
- You're wearing my tuxedo.
- Yes.

1584
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:35,533
Have you ever heard
of the saying,

1585
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,090
"Never wear
another man's tuxedo"?

1586
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:38,702
You know, you've been
touching a lot of things

1587
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:40,260
- that are not yours.
- Okay. Okay.

1588
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:41,471
- Guys, this is... Come on.
- I don't think so.

1589
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:42,864
That is a thing.
No, no,

1590
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:44,542
- this has nothing to do...
- Margot, it's okay.

1591
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:45,910
- This is between us. Okay?
- Let's not.

1592
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:47,343
You cannot just steal
another man's clothes...

1593
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:48,579
Don't put your finger
on my chest.

1594
01:07:48,603 --> 01:07:50,070
...steal another man's
girlfriend.

1595
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:51,381
Don't put your finger
on my chest again.

1596
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:52,483
Or else what?
What you gonna do?

1597
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:53,841
All right.

1598
01:07:53,908 --> 01:07:56,410
Are you threatening me
with a deadly weapon?

1599
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:58,345
- Yes.
- Karate chop!

1600
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:02,517
- Forgive me, Sensei.
- Kip!

1601
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,989
- What is happening?
- He started it.

1602
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:12,827
Kip up!

1603
01:08:13,293 --> 01:08:16,698
Okay. So, you really want
to do this, huh?

1604
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:18,432
I guess. Okay.

1605
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,002
She told you
I was a black belt, right?

1606
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:22,402
Uh, yes, she did.

1607
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:25,238
Griffin, Griffin,
he's not worth it!

1608
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:27,709
- Griffin? Who's Griffin?
- I have no idea.

1609
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:29,343
But the new Kip is hot.

1610
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:30,788
- Brian, do something!
- Here we go.

1611
01:08:30,812 --> 01:08:31,846
Oh!

1612
01:08:32,145 --> 01:08:33,748
- Okay.
- Hit him, Kip!

1613
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:35,817
Uh, Kip number one! Whoo!

1614
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:37,150
Really, a shoe?

1615
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:42,289
- Oh, shit.
- Are you good?

1616
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:44,076
Whose shoe is that?
You guys look beautiful.

1617
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:49,329
- Not the cake.
- Did we mess up the cake?

1618
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,341
- No, we're good.
- Cake's okay.

1619
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:52,499
It's okay. It's okay.

1620
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,234
Thank God. The cake's okay.

1621
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:56,070
Guys, you're two grown men!

1622
01:08:56,136 --> 01:08:57,337
- Stop it!
- Oh.

1623
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:58,606
You guys, that's enough!

1624
01:08:58,673 --> 01:09:00,041
- Hold on a sec.
- Yeah, try it.

1625
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:02,677
- Hey, not bad.
- Pretty good.

1626
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:05,880
Did you just rip
my Armani pants?

1627
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:07,615
You just ripped my groin!

1628
01:09:09,684 --> 01:09:11,427
Kip, we're done. We're done,
you guys. That's enough!

1629
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:12,887
I think we're done!

1630
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:14,388
That's it, Kip.

1631
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:15,757
- Go to sleep!
- Kill him!

1632
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:17,290
Go to sleep!
Go to sleep, bitch!

1633
01:09:17,357 --> 01:09:18,626
That's not how it works.

1634
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,730
- You done?
- Yeah.

1635
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:24,866
This is like Godzilla
versus Bambi.

1636
01:09:24,932 --> 01:09:26,701
We're done. For sure.

1637
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:37,578
Cake's safe.

1638
01:09:40,148 --> 01:09:41,448
Is that a ring?

1639
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:43,751
You're proposing tonight?

1640
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:44,886
Uh-huh.

1641
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:46,621
You guys literally just met.

1642
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:48,690
- Not to me, to his girlfriend.
- Oh, shit.

1643
01:09:48,756 --> 01:09:50,958
Kip has another girlfriend?

1644
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:52,827
Wow. What a dick!

1645
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:55,429
Oh, my God!

1646
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:57,632
You brought a fake date
to my wedding?

1647
01:09:57,699 --> 01:09:59,534
No, no, no. He's...
He's not a fake date.

1648
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,737
He's just...
He's just not Kip.

1649
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:06,641
Oh, so not-Kip is in all
of our wedding photos!

1650
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:08,509
- Dude!
- I'm so sorry. It's...

1651
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:10,845
I was... I didn't...

1652
01:10:10,912 --> 01:10:13,181
Congratulations, sister.
You really did it.

1653
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:14,615
You restored my belief

1654
01:10:14,682 --> 01:10:18,218
in your ability to ruin
absolutely everything.

1655
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:19,821
I'm so sorry. I didn't...

1656
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:20,888
Sorry...

1657
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,123
Hold on. Margot! Wait!

1658
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,758
Excuse me. Sorry.

1659
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,562
Margot! Margot.
Margot, I'm sorry.

1660
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:29,329
Sorry for what?
You didn't do anything.

1661
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,331
- I mean, this is all my fault.
- No.

1662
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,400
Look, I should have told you,
okay? I tried.

1663
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:34,912
- I tried to tell you.
- Tell me what?

1664
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:37,437
That you're practically
engaged to a supermodel?

1665
01:10:37,505 --> 01:10:38,706
No, okay.

1666
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:41,075
- She's just a regular model.
- It doesn't matter!

1667
01:10:41,142 --> 01:10:42,510
I mean,
it's none of my business!

1668
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,979
Carrie's right.
I'm a total disaster.

1669
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:47,715
I mean, what kind of a crazy
person brings a total stranger

1670
01:10:47,782 --> 01:10:50,051
to one of the biggest days
of their sister's life?

1671
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:52,820
Well, I mean, in all fairness,
we did meet last night.

1672
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,458
Look, I'm sorry
I brought you into this.

1673
01:10:58,526 --> 01:11:00,494
- You're so nice.
- No, I'm not.

1674
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:02,163
I'm not nice, okay? This...

1675
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:04,498
Like, what I'm doing here,
this is not nice, okay?

1676
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,366
This is really selfish.

1677
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:08,102
What?

1678
01:11:08,503 --> 01:11:10,047
I don't know.
When I saw you the other night

1679
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:11,371
in the parking lot, I just...

1680
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:14,374
I felt something that I've
never felt before, and I...

1681
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:15,910
I wanted to wrap
my arms around you,

1682
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,411
and just tell you that
everything was gonna be okay.

1683
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:23,416
And then 24 hours later,
you needed my help, and...

1684
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:24,919
I don't know, I just...

1685
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,354
I couldn't say no.

1686
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:29,590
Babe.

1687
01:11:29,657 --> 01:11:31,159
- Oh, God.
- Are you okay?

1688
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:32,301
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I'm...

1689
01:11:32,325 --> 01:11:33,336
What are you still doing here?

1690
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,560
What are you still doing here?

1691
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:36,673
Dude, it's over, all right?
She doesn't want you here!

1692
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:37,908
Don't tell me what she wants.
All right?

1693
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:39,442
- Okay, guys...
- I know she doesn't want

1694
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:40,878
some asshole
who can't make up his mind.

1695
01:11:40,902 --> 01:11:42,345
- Really? I'm an asshole?
- Okay, you guys! Stop it!

1696
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:43,070
Aren't you, like,
engaged or something?

1697
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:44,205
That's enough!

1698
01:11:44,272 --> 01:11:46,306
Griffin is leaving.

1699
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:49,844
He has somewhere
very important to be.

1700
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:53,281
Yeah. That's right.

1701
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:55,950
I'm leaving. You win.

1702
01:11:56,017 --> 01:11:57,251
- Congrats.
- Hey.

1703
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,853
- What about my tux?
- Kip!

1704
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,898
Do you know how long it took
me to get that tux tailored?

1705
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:02,322
- Enough.
- Oh, my God!

1706
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:03,825
I'm so sor... Did you want...

1707
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:04,992
You want your tux?

1708
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:06,727
Yeah, sorry, you should've
just said that.

1709
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:08,038
- First thing.
- Oh! Here we go again.

1710
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,263
- Naked guy!
- Griffin, stop!

1711
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,598
- Right on cue.
- $2,200.

1712
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:11,599
- Okay, stop!
- $3,200, but who's counting?

1713
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:12,776
Griffin, what are you doing?

1714
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,135
I got to give him back his tux.

1715
01:12:14,202 --> 01:12:16,103
- It's $2,800.
- Is he taking his clothes off?

1716
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,539
- I swear, he's a nudist.
- This wedding keeps getting

1717
01:12:18,606 --> 01:12:19,774
better and better.

1718
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:21,585
- It's, like, sticky.
- You can't go outside

1719
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:22,409
like that!
You're gonna freeze! Stop it!

1720
01:12:22,475 --> 01:12:23,578
Fuck your cufflinks.

1721
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:24,779
- Sir?
- What?

1722
01:12:24,846 --> 01:12:26,314
You can't be naked in the lobby.

1723
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:28,182
Sorry. Sorry.

1724
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:29,449
Thank you very much.

1725
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:30,794
I don't have any cash, but...
Sorry.

1726
01:12:30,818 --> 01:12:33,154
Well, it's been
a little slice of heaven.

1727
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,387
Yeah.

1728
01:12:34,454 --> 01:12:35,957
Unforgettable.

1729
01:12:37,525 --> 01:12:39,994
I guess I'll just pay
for the dry cleaning.

1730
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:41,394
Come on.

1731
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:43,030
Look, why are you even here?

1732
01:12:43,598 --> 01:12:45,633
- I came to see you.
- You broke up with me.

1733
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,735
I know, and I made a mistake.

1734
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:50,938
Babe, just give us
another chance. Please.

1735
01:12:55,076 --> 01:12:56,544
I need a drink.

1736
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,846
Sorry, my love.

1737
01:13:01,782 --> 01:13:02,782
Damn it!

1738
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:07,922
Ugh. Shit.

1739
01:13:11,092 --> 01:13:12,492
Fuck.

1740
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,975
Hey, man. It's me again.

1741
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:02,610
Uh, could you take me
to the bus stop?

1742
01:14:02,677 --> 01:14:04,444
Sure. But it looks like
you forgot somethin'.

1743
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:06,580
Oh, yeah. The tux.
It wasn't mine.

1744
01:14:06,647 --> 01:14:08,516
Not the tux. The girl.

1745
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:11,185
She wasn't mine either.

1746
01:14:12,787 --> 01:14:13,888
Could've fooled me.

1747
01:14:14,155 --> 01:14:16,791
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah!

1748
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:43,017
Hey, man.
You forgot your pants.

1749
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,620
Oh, man! I might do the same!

1750
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:11,845
Hey.

1751
01:15:12,213 --> 01:15:15,549
I know, yeah.
I'm on the list. Griffin Reed.

1752
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:19,754
You good? Thank you.

1753
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:23,524
His name is Griffin?

1754
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:24,759
I know.

1755
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:26,160
Did you tell him?

1756
01:15:26,227 --> 01:15:27,561
No, I didn't tell him.

1757
01:15:27,628 --> 01:15:29,163
Wow. Talk about fate.

1758
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,665
It's not fate! I wish people
would stop using that word.

1759
01:15:31,732 --> 01:15:33,467
But you like him.

1760
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:37,872
So? He's proposing to some
model named Clementine.

1761
01:15:37,938 --> 01:15:40,441
- Oh! Clementine Pratt?
- You know who she is?

1762
01:15:40,509 --> 01:15:41,976
I've seen her Instagram.

1763
01:15:42,043 --> 01:15:45,046
She's got, like,
10,000 followers.

1764
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:46,747
She's so pretty.

1765
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,716
Well,
if he's so in love with her,

1766
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,918
what's he doing
at a wedding with you?

1767
01:15:50,985 --> 01:15:52,253
He's a really nice guy.

1768
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:53,897
- No one's that nice.
- It doesn't matter!

1769
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:55,756
He's on his way
to propose to someone else,

1770
01:15:55,823 --> 01:15:57,558
and the real Kip
came back for me,

1771
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,760
so everything worked out
just the way it should.

1772
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:02,163
Okay? There's your... fate.

1773
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:05,499
Yeah! It was fire!

1774
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,868
Really?
I wish I was there!

1775
01:16:07,935 --> 01:16:09,303
Yeah, you should have come.

1776
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:10,738
I'll come next time.

1777
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:14,842
Better! Appreciate it!

1778
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,710
Wait, do you have my social?

1779
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,913
Oh, yeah.
Your pictures are so great!

1780
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,981
- Okay, baby.
- Hi!

1781
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:28,355
Hi, uh, can I just get
a whiskey neat, please?

1782
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:31,158
Hey, you're Clem's guy, right?

1783
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:34,995
- Oh, uh, yeah.
- Grover?

1784
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:36,697
- Griffin.
- Ah, yes.

1785
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:39,033
Griffin, the... lifeguard.

1786
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,735
- Lawyer.
- Ah. Good on you, mate.

1787
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:43,337
- Hi!
- Hey, babe.

1788
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:44,772
- Hi.
- Hi.

1789
01:16:45,106 --> 01:16:47,217
Look who decided to show up
to their engagement party.

1790
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:49,343
What the hell happened to you?
Were you mugged?

1791
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,644
What are you wearing?

1792
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:52,122
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Look, my phone died.

1793
01:16:52,146 --> 01:16:54,148
It's just, it's been
a really long night, so...

1794
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:55,215
Yeah. For me.

1795
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,860
Do you know how embarrassing
it is to show up

1796
01:16:56,884 --> 01:16:58,195
to your own
New Year's Eve party alone?

1797
01:16:58,219 --> 01:16:59,219
I know. I'm...

1798
01:16:59,253 --> 01:17:00,531
I had sponsors
waiting for our arrival!

1799
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:01,755
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1800
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:03,222
And what am I supposed
to tell Zara?

1801
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,493
- I don't know. I...
- You know what?

1802
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:08,262
It doesn't matter.
I will smooth it up with Zara

1803
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:11,165
and you can wear them
for the wedding.

1804
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:12,800
Okay.

1805
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,678
Don't worry.
Everything's all set.

1806
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:15,903
- Okay?
- Okay.

1807
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:20,609
Please give it up for
the fabulous Clementine Pratt!

1808
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:26,780
Thank you! Thank you.
My goodness.

1809
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:29,183
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna sing.

1810
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,951
But I just wanted to thank James

1811
01:17:31,018 --> 01:17:34,355
for hosting
this incredible party tonight!

1812
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,323
I don't know about you all,

1813
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,492
but I have a feeling
this is going to be

1814
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,428
the best New Year's Eve ever.

1815
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:45,799
Babe, I think you're on.

1816
01:17:47,201 --> 01:17:48,302
Okay!

1817
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,371
- Who's ready for the bouquet?
- Hey.

1818
01:17:50,437 --> 01:17:51,640
Okay, on the count of three.

1819
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:52,706
- Ready?
- Okay!

1820
01:17:52,773 --> 01:17:54,074
Three, two...

1821
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,476
One!
No, I'm just kidding.

1822
01:17:55,544 --> 01:17:56,645
- What?
- Just one second

1823
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,878
before you guys do that.

1824
01:17:58,179 --> 01:17:59,490
This is my favorite part
of the wedding, by the way.

1825
01:17:59,514 --> 01:18:00,881
But I just have to do this.

1826
01:18:00,948 --> 01:18:02,750
- What the hell?
- I really appreciate it.

1827
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:04,051
Would you guys just mind?

1828
01:18:04,118 --> 01:18:06,588
Many of you guys
don't know me, okay?

1829
01:18:06,655 --> 01:18:09,857
But, uh, I am Kip.
The real Kip.

1830
01:18:09,924 --> 01:18:11,859
And I just want to apologize

1831
01:18:11,926 --> 01:18:13,562
for what happened
with the imposter Kip.

1832
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:14,762
I kinda liked the imposter.

1833
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,430
And I don't want
to steal the thunder

1834
01:18:16,497 --> 01:18:17,998
from the beautiful bride.

1835
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:19,133
- Oh, no.
- Yes.

1836
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,410
We wouldn't want
to do that. No.

1837
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:21,546
- This has to be done.
- Right.

1838
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,003
This is very important.

1839
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:28,208
Okay.

1840
01:18:31,613 --> 01:18:33,814
Oh, shit.

1841
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:42,122
You know,
whenever I imagined myself

1842
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:43,991
proposing to my future wife,

1843
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:47,629
I always knew
it would only happen once.

1844
01:18:47,696 --> 01:18:50,764
When I imagined the man
of my dreams proposing to me,

1845
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:53,901
I wanted it to be
once in a lifetime.

1846
01:18:53,968 --> 01:18:55,202
And I'd never give that moment

1847
01:18:55,269 --> 01:18:58,105
to someone
who I had any doubts about.

1848
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:00,307
Twenty-four hours ago,

1849
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:03,978
all I wanted was for you
to ask me to marry you.

1850
01:19:04,044 --> 01:19:05,379
<i>Twenty-four hours ago,</i>

1851
01:19:05,446 --> 01:19:07,381
I'd convinced myself
that you were the woman

1852
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:10,251
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.

1853
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:16,090
But that's...

1854
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:17,291
Changed.

1855
01:19:19,893 --> 01:19:21,328
- Um...
- What?

1856
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:23,964
I... I thought
this is what you wanted.

1857
01:19:24,031 --> 01:19:26,333
- I can't. I can't do this.
- What?

1858
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,002
I can't let you do this.

1859
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,937
I'm really sorry.
I... I can't.

1860
01:19:30,004 --> 01:19:32,039
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1861
01:19:33,007 --> 01:19:34,842
Come on. Get up.

1862
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:38,145
Happy New Year, everyone!
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Here.

1863
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,080
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

1864
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:54,895
Just... Just stop
for just a second. All right?

1865
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:57,565
I know that I'm embarrassing
myself, but...

1866
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:01,201
I treated you terribly
last night.

1867
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:02,779
- And I am sorry. Last night...
- Yeah.

1868
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:05,306
The truth is, I have spent
the last 24 hours thinking

1869
01:20:05,372 --> 01:20:08,108
that I've been making the
biggest mistake of my life.

1870
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:12,747
I... actually think
that I love you,

1871
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:15,449
and I...
I do want to marry you.

1872
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:19,119
You "think"? What,

1873
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:20,921
are you... are you crazy?

1874
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,323
You don't love me.

1875
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:26,226
And you know what? I...
I don't love you.

1876
01:20:26,293 --> 01:20:27,828
I mean, I had more fun tonight,

1877
01:20:27,895 --> 01:20:29,963
a more honest,
genuine connection

1878
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,642
with a total stranger
than I've had with you

1879
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:32,866
in the last three months!

1880
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:34,736
Wow. Kick a guy
while he's down.

1881
01:20:34,803 --> 01:20:36,805
I'm just being honest.

1882
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:38,238
You know it's true.

1883
01:20:38,305 --> 01:20:40,874
And you'll bounce back,
I'm sure.

1884
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:43,043
Goodbye, okay?

1885
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:46,280
For real this time, please.

1886
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,248
Goodbye.

1887
01:21:01,796 --> 01:21:03,497
Oh, my God.

1888
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:13,474
Okay...

1889
01:21:29,624 --> 01:21:31,125
Ted, are you hungry?

1890
01:21:33,193 --> 01:21:37,164
Hey, buddy. Happy New Year.

1891
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,401
Yum, yum, yum.

1892
01:21:40,802 --> 01:21:42,202
Good night, pal.

1893
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:48,710
Wow, okay.

1894
01:21:48,777 --> 01:21:50,712
So you're just sneaking out
of my wedding?

1895
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:53,748
I was going more
for graceful exit.

1896
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:55,916
Oh, okay. Right.

1897
01:21:55,983 --> 01:21:58,887
Just, uh, quick question first.

1898
01:21:59,453 --> 01:22:01,856
- Why do you hate me?
- Hate you?

1899
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:04,024
- Yeah.
- I don't hate you.

1900
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:05,325
I worship you.

1901
01:22:05,392 --> 01:22:07,595
- Okay. Come on.
- What? It's true!

1902
01:22:07,662 --> 01:22:08,863
I wish I were more like you.

1903
01:22:08,929 --> 01:22:11,131
I mean, you're brave.
You're smart.

1904
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:13,267
Everywhere we go,
everybody just adores you.

1905
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,770
I mean, you're marrying the
best guy in the world tonight.

1906
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:19,173
Your life is perfect.

1907
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:21,843
You think my life is perfect?

1908
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:23,277
Are you crazy?

1909
01:22:23,343 --> 01:22:25,847
No, the only difference
between me and you is

1910
01:22:25,914 --> 01:22:27,981
I go for what I want.

1911
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,451
And you're too afraid to try.

1912
01:22:31,786 --> 01:22:34,054
So, stop trying to be me.

1913
01:22:35,155 --> 01:22:36,658
Just go be you.

1914
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:39,493
You're right.

1915
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:42,429
Thank you.

1916
01:22:42,664 --> 01:22:43,531
Yeah.

1917
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:45,667
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.

1918
01:22:45,733 --> 01:22:47,535
No. Hey, it's fine.

1919
01:22:47,602 --> 01:22:50,070
You know, Brian said that
the fight already went viral.

1920
01:22:54,274 --> 01:22:56,076
I love you, sister.

1921
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,079
I love you too.

1922
01:23:04,084 --> 01:23:05,520
Hmm.

1923
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,055
- Ten! Nine!
- Oh!

1924
01:23:08,121 --> 01:23:09,289
- Eight! Seven!
- Um...

1925
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:10,734
- Go. Go.
- Yeah, okay. But don't forget

1926
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:12,001
- brunch tomorrow.
- Six! Five! Four!

1927
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:13,227
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1928
01:23:13,293 --> 01:23:18,165
Three! Two! One!
Happy New Year!

1929
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,760
Hi, Ted.

1930
01:24:30,805 --> 01:24:33,575
I love what you've done
with my apartment.

1931
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:39,747
Margot?

1932
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:43,283
I rang the bell,
like, a thousand times,

1933
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:44,786
but you didn't answer,
so I just...

1934
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:45,954
I don't have a bell.

1935
01:24:46,286 --> 01:24:48,856
Oh. I wonder what that was.

1936
01:24:50,024 --> 01:24:53,126
Wait, hold on. So, what...
what are you doing here?

1937
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:54,696
Uh, you left this at my house.

1938
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:58,432
I thought it might be
important. Legal stuff.

1939
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:01,335
Yeah. Thank you.

1940
01:25:07,407 --> 01:25:09,510
- You're alone.
- Um, yeah.

1941
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:12,112
And not engaged.

1942
01:25:12,947 --> 01:25:14,414
- And...
- No...

1943
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:16,684
Wait. How did you know?

1944
01:25:17,217 --> 01:25:18,385
Instagram.

1945
01:25:18,653 --> 01:25:20,688
Ah, right. Yeah.

1946
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:26,226
Wait, hold on. So, you came
all the way over here

1947
01:25:26,293 --> 01:25:29,697
at 2:00 a.m.
just to return my bag?

1948
01:25:31,032 --> 01:25:32,132
Yeah.

1949
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:34,535
Well, and to show you something.

1950
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:36,738
You want to show me something?

1951
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:38,606
Yes.

1952
01:25:43,878 --> 01:25:45,212
Unzip.

1953
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:47,649
Is this a trap?

1954
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:49,349
- No!
- Okay.

1955
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:51,351
- Just do it!
- All right. All right.

1956
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:00,928
The stupid things
we do in college, right?

1957
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,831
Um...

1958
01:26:04,932 --> 01:26:06,366
That's a...

1959
01:26:07,234 --> 01:26:08,636
- A griffin.
- What...

1960
01:26:08,703 --> 01:26:10,705
I have a griffin tattoo.

1961
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:12,272
You got that in college?

1962
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:14,641
Yeah.

1963
01:26:14,776 --> 01:26:16,844
I had just broken up
with my boyfriend.

1964
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:19,212
I was a little drunk.

1965
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,883
And I told the guy
to surprise me.

1966
01:26:21,949 --> 01:26:24,652
So... surprise!

1967
01:26:32,426 --> 01:26:34,062
Oh, thank God,
it's not a Tweety Bird.

1968
01:26:40,768 --> 01:26:41,869
This is insane.

1969
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:43,771
You have a griffin on your body.

1970
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:45,173
If you have "Margot"
on your ass,

1971
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:46,808
I really am calling the police.

1972
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:48,876
Oh, not yet,
but that's a good idea.

1973
01:26:54,481 --> 01:26:55,983
Are you fucking kidding me?

1974
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,284
Oh, shit! Clementine!

1975
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,553
What are you doing here?

1976
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:00,019
You didn't even call
to check on me.

1977
01:27:00,054 --> 01:27:01,656
What... We broke up.

1978
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,457
I want my Sonic are.

1979
01:27:03,691 --> 01:27:04,525
What?

1980
01:27:04,592 --> 01:27:06,027
My Sonic are toothbrush.

1981
01:27:06,094 --> 01:27:08,395
I actually had to pay
for that. I want it back.

1982
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,565
- Now?
- Yes, now!

1983
01:27:10,631 --> 01:27:12,600
Before you rub it
all over your mouth,

1984
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:14,102
or clean your toilet with it.

1985
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:15,737
Or let someone else use it.

1986
01:27:15,803 --> 01:27:17,839
Yeah, okay, all right.
Just one second.

1987
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:18,940
Thanks.

1988
01:27:21,776 --> 01:27:22,844
Wait.

1989
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,045
I know you.

1990
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:26,714
Are you the girl
from Bennigan's?

1991
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,415
Yes.

1992
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,351
- You stole my Uber.
- So, you stole my boyfriend?

1993
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:35,189
No. Not... Not really.
Not... Not on purpose.

1994
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:36,299
How long has this been going on?

1995
01:27:36,323 --> 01:27:39,060
Minutes! Seconds. Not long.

1996
01:27:39,127 --> 01:27:40,293
What kind of person steals

1997
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,996
someone's boyfriend
on New Year's Eve?

1998
01:27:42,063 --> 01:27:43,564
I didn't mean to. I swear.

1999
01:27:43,631 --> 01:27:45,133
I think this is everything.

2000
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,234
I need a bag!

2001
01:27:46,299 --> 01:27:47,869
Bag, yes. One second.

2002
01:27:48,301 --> 01:27:49,412
Did you know he was supposed

2003
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:50,838
to ask me to marry him tonight?

2004
01:27:51,172 --> 01:27:52,907
Um, was he?

2005
01:27:52,974 --> 01:27:54,609
It was so humiliating.

2006
01:27:54,675 --> 01:27:57,377
He basically dumped me
in front of the whole party.

2007
01:27:57,444 --> 01:28:00,915
Some people even got it
on video.

2008
01:28:00,982 --> 01:28:03,818
I'm sorry. Tissue?

2009
01:28:04,384 --> 01:28:07,655
- Thanks.
- That's... That's awful.

2010
01:28:09,524 --> 01:28:11,659
I've seen your Instagram.

2011
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:13,393
Your pictures are really pretty.

2012
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,762
Thanks.

2013
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:17,999
It's Face tune.

2014
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:19,567
Oh. That's a good app.

2015
01:28:19,634 --> 01:28:21,602
Okay, I have a bag.

2016
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:23,905
She doesn't need a bag!
She needs a hug!

2017
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,206
And more tissues!

2018
01:28:25,372 --> 01:28:27,008
Seriously?

2019
01:28:27,307 --> 01:28:28,643
- Griffin!
- Okay.

2020
01:28:30,945 --> 01:28:33,080
You do seem like a nice person.

2021
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:34,849
I'm trying to be.

2022
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:39,352
Oh, no. Okay.

2023
01:28:41,055 --> 01:28:43,891
You know, I really hope you
don't wake up tomorrow

2024
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:47,562
and realize there was never
anything real between you two.

2025
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:48,963
And that you just ruined

2026
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,932
the entire course
of all of our lives

2027
01:28:50,998 --> 01:28:55,970
for some meaningless, romantic
New Year's Eve fantasy.

2028
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,975
Okay, so, it looks
like we're out of Kleenex,

2029
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:02,442
but I found some TP.

2030
01:29:03,311 --> 01:29:04,679
I have to go.

2031
01:29:05,613 --> 01:29:08,749
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

2032
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:10,218
Wait, Margot,
where are you going?

2033
01:29:10,284 --> 01:29:11,519
Margot?

2034
01:29:13,386 --> 01:29:14,655
What did you do?

2035
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:18,059
Nothing.

2036
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:21,128
All right, take your stuff.

2037
01:29:28,236 --> 01:29:29,537
Margot?

2038
01:29:30,403 --> 01:29:31,471
Margot, wait.

2039
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:32,907
What just happened?

2040
01:29:32,974 --> 01:29:34,108
I can't do this.

2041
01:29:34,175 --> 01:29:36,143
I can't be responsible
for ruining your life

2042
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,578
like I do everyone else's.

2043
01:29:37,645 --> 01:29:39,814
Oh, you're not ruining
anything. Okay?

2044
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:42,415
Listen, Margot,
I'm crazy about you.

2045
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:44,384
You don't even know me.

2046
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:45,720
I mean, a couple hours ago,

2047
01:29:45,786 --> 01:29:47,989
you were gonna propose
to somebody else.

2048
01:29:48,055 --> 01:29:50,892
Yeah, and it would've been
the worst mistake of my life.

2049
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:52,994
Come on, 15 Maple Drive?

2050
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,395
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>
Your tattoo?

2051
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:57,231
That's got to mean something,
right?

2052
01:29:57,298 --> 01:29:58,633
You know this is fate.

2053
01:29:58,699 --> 01:30:01,168
I am so tired of everyone saying

2054
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:02,670
that everything is fate.

2055
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:05,172
Okay, who doesn't love
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

2056
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:06,340
15 Maple Drive?

2057
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:07,541
I'm sure if you googled it,

2058
01:30:07,608 --> 01:30:08,976
there are thousands of results.

2059
01:30:09,043 --> 01:30:11,045
You could've woken up
in anyone's bed.

2060
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:13,881
Yeah, but I woke up in yours.
Okay?

2061
01:30:13,948 --> 01:30:15,049
So, call it fate,

2062
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:17,018
or dumb luck, or chance,
or whatever it is,

2063
01:30:17,084 --> 01:30:19,120
but I still get to choose, okay?

2064
01:30:19,186 --> 01:30:21,155
And I... I choose you.

2065
01:30:21,222 --> 01:30:23,958
And... And I choose...

2066
01:30:25,026 --> 01:30:27,561
I choose to do the right thing.

2067
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:31,431
Maybe fate
is that girl waiting for you

2068
01:30:31,498 --> 01:30:32,542
in your apartment right now.

2069
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,135
You don't believe that.

2070
01:30:34,467 --> 01:30:35,536
Come on.

2071
01:30:35,803 --> 01:30:38,105
Thank you
for helping me tonight.

2072
01:30:38,606 --> 01:30:40,608
I mean, you really are

2073
01:30:40,675 --> 01:30:42,910
the nicest human I've ever met.

2074
01:30:42,977 --> 01:30:46,247
And before you say it,
"nice" isn't a bad thing.

2075
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:50,117
It's a great thing.
It's a rare thing.

2076
01:30:51,519 --> 01:30:53,453
So, don't ever stop.

2077
01:30:55,256 --> 01:30:57,124
Wait, Margot, please, just...

2078
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,494
You know, when the universe
gives you a gift,

2079
01:31:01,562 --> 01:31:03,030
you don't just say no.

2080
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:16,043
Happy New Year, Griffin.

2081
01:31:51,979 --> 01:31:53,581
Oh, shit.

2082
01:31:55,082 --> 01:31:57,118
Oh, God.

2083
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:24,278
Hey!

2084
01:32:24,345 --> 01:32:25,813
Oh, there he is!

2085
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,182
Happy New Year, everybody.
Hello, hello!

2086
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:29,984
Honey, what happened
to your face?

2087
01:32:30,051 --> 01:32:31,786
Oh, it's fine, it's fine.
I just...

2088
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:34,822
Yeah, last night,
I ran into a fist.

2089
01:32:34,889 --> 01:32:36,123
- Fist?
- Yeah.

2090
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,502
Well, you should see
the other guy.

2091
01:32:37,526 --> 01:32:38,659
Yeah, right?

2092
01:32:38,726 --> 01:32:40,194
So, where is Clementine?

2093
01:32:40,261 --> 01:32:41,862
Yeah, yeah,
where's this gorgeous fiancée

2094
01:32:41,929 --> 01:32:43,440
your mother keeps showing me
on Instacart, huh?

2095
01:32:43,464 --> 01:32:44,732
Instacart! Um...

2096
01:32:44,799 --> 01:32:47,001
She's, uh, actually
not gonna make it today.

2097
01:32:47,068 --> 01:32:49,336
What happened? Oh, she didn't
get your cold, did she?

2098
01:32:49,403 --> 01:32:50,638
No, she's fine, actually.

2099
01:32:50,704 --> 01:32:52,640
Um, yeah...

2100
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:57,812
It's actually just...
It's not gonna work out.

2101
01:32:57,878 --> 01:32:59,847
Yeah, I'm sorry
to disappoint you guys.

2102
01:32:59,914 --> 01:33:01,215
Oh, disappoint who? Us?

2103
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:03,951
Yeah, I know, December 30th
is like your special day,

2104
01:33:04,018 --> 01:33:05,538
- and I kind of blew it.
- Hell, son...

2105
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:07,154
Son, it's just a day.

2106
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:09,123
I mean,
you'll find your own day.

2107
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:10,257
And your own girl.

2108
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:11,725
Oh. I love you.

2109
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:13,528
I love you more.

2110
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:15,029
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

2111
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:16,306
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

2112
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:17,930
- We'll be right here.
- Okay? All right.

2113
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:30,878
Okay.

2114
01:33:51,031 --> 01:33:52,133
Dude!

2115
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:53,234
What?

2116
01:33:53,568 --> 01:33:55,136
- Hey, Kip's here.
- Oh, my God.

2117
01:33:55,202 --> 01:33:56,670
What are you doing here?

2118
01:33:58,573 --> 01:33:59,840
Wow.
