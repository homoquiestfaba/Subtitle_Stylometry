stop pretending?

I thought I recognized your voice
the other day.

895
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:47,035
And then, last night,
when you rushed to Laura's side,

896
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:48,704
it became clear.

897
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,707
I'm not the only one
who's been pretending, am I?

Who told me Mrs. Bennett
had died.

900
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,130
I never said she died.

901
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:01,091
I said it was too late,
and that remains true.

902
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,886
That makes no sense.

903
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:08,140
When Laura came back
from Pennsylvania,

904
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:12,060
never having once seen you because
your parents just wouldn't allow it,

905
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:14,146
her cancer came back.

906
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:17,399
And I had a decision to make.

907
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:20,194
Never in my wildest imagination
did I actually believe

908
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:23,071
there was a chance
of you actually turning up here.

909
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:26,700
So I hired someone to be Katie.

910
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:32,414
I just wanted Laura's final days
on this earth to be happy.

911
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,500
Joyful.

912
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:39,254
I'm sorry how this turned out,
but that's why I tried to discourage you

913
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:41,298
from coming
when you called that day.

914
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:43,717
That's not the only reason.

915
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:46,970
Just because I'm Amish doesn't mean
I don't know what an heir is.

916
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,973
There is nothing untoward
about this.

917
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:52,935
It's a mere formality.

918
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:57,439
Laura is handing everything off
to her foundation.

919
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:01,026
Having Alyson here-
That's her name, Alyson.

920

- Makes the legal process simpler.

921
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:09,034

with a simple signature.

930

She believes she's her daughter.
And that belief is more important

931

upside down.
