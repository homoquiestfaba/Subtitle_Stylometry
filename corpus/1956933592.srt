00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,658
CASHIER: $10, please.

4
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,696
Enjoy the show.

5
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,769
Can I help you?

6
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,804
Yeah, is Nick Taylor here?

7
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,206
It's $10 to get in.

8
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,140
No, is Nick Taylor here?

9
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,141
CASHIER: I said $10.

10
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,844
Do you want to oil the girls?

11
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,045
What?

12
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,182
For $20, you can
oil the wrestlers.

13
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,151
No, thanks.

Where's Nick Taylor?

19
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,776
Nick Taylor?

20
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,744
Thank you.

[knock on door]

22
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,384
Come in.

23
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,685
DANNY: Nick Taylor?

24
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,425
- I know you?
- Yes, sir.

25
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,893
We, uh, met once.

26
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:53,927
It's a long time ago.

27
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,533
Let me guess.

28
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,804
You're this year's top gun come
to pay homage to the master.

29
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,172
Right?

30
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,741
[laughs]

31
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,209
Bless you, my son.

32
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,579
May you go out amongst
the masses and kick ass

33
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,481
until you reach
the promised land.

34
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,353
What happened to you?

35
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,454
What happened to me?

36
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,325
Kid, I'm going to
pull in more money

37
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,194
tonight than I did in my
best month as champion

38
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,763
of the fucking world.

39
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,865
You used to say self-respect
was the most important

40
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,100
thing a man could own.

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,868
Oh, gee.

42
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,037
Does that mean I'm
not your hero anymore?

43
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,578
You don't know a damn
thing about me, kid.

44
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,813
Then I guess I don't.

45
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,351
Hold on.

46
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:55,856
Let's see if you can fight
as well as you can talk.

Tony.

50
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,186
Can I have my
receipts, too, please?

51
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,157
[cheering]

52
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,130
How you doing, Nicky?

53
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,501
He's good.

54
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,672
[cheering]

55
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,643
Ah, you seen one,
you seen 'em all.

56
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:56,443
No.

57
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,046
No, he's really good.

58
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:03,016

60
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,901
I'm invincible.

61
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,242
What's wrong?

62
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,177
Nothing.

63
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,382
What are you looking for?

64
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,349
My keys.

65
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,517
You seen them?

66
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,886
Where are you going?

67
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,088
I'm going out.

68
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,557
Got to talk to a guy.

69
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,958
Look, Nick, whatever
you're planning to do,

70
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,727
I'm sure you'll feel a
lot better in the morning

71
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,228
if you just come home with me.

72
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,063
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,164
Huh?

74
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,066
Am I out of control or
something like that?

75
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,104
Just come home with me, OK?

76
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,609
Give me the keys.

77
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,379
Come on.

78
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,314
Thank you.

79
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,840
[music playing]

80
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,184

[music playing]

85
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,077
Don't worry, kid.

86
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,478
I'm alone.

87
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,880
That wasn't fair loss night.

88
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,682
If it had been one-on-one.

89
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,518
You know, sometimes
life isn't fair, kid.

90
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,055
I don't need
advice from losers.

91
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,489
Wait a minute.

92
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,791
I want to show you something.

93
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,530
I want you to hit me.

94
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,631
What?

95
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,900
Hit me.

96
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,369
I don't hit old men.

97
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,937
Hit me, God damn it!

98
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,042
Come on.

99
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,815
So what's your point?

100
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,084
My point is you can't hit me.

101
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,118
So?

102
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,287
So you think you're
king of the world,

103
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,990
but you can't lay a glove
on a defenseless old man?

104
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,358
You Used to be
champion of the world.

105
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,927
Not anymore.

106
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:10,030
And if you can't hit me, you
can't beat the guy who beat me.

107
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,964
Right?

108
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,969
Now look, Danny,
you came by the club

109
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,505
last night for a reason, right?

110
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,573
I'm on my way to Vegas
for the world championships.

111
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,344
I thought you could
recommend a trainer.

112
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,245
Come back tonight.

113
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,823
[music playing]

114
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,649
So, what's the
special occasion?

115
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,084
What do you mean?

116
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,452
Well, you don't
usually barbecue

117
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,089
in the middle of the week.
- No special reason.

118
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,666
Tony said you were thinking
about treating that kid.

119
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,868
You mean Danny?

120
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,802
Yeah, Danny.

121
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,972
Think you finally found
someone who can beat Jake?

122
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,506
Hey, the kid does look
good, you got to admit.

123
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,176
I thought it was over, this
thing between you and Jake.

124
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,878
Look, this has nothing
to do with that, OK?

125
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,645
The kid wants to be
champion of the world.

126
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,580
He's got to beat Jake.

127
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,915
It's as simple as that.

128
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,816
Don't lie to me, Nick.

129
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,619
This is about revenge.

130
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,154
Jake took my title.

131
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,822
He took my pride.
He took my wife.

132
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,224
What do you want me to do?

133
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,026
Do you want me to pretend
that it didn't happen?

134
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,595
No, accept it and move on.

135
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,230
It happened three years ago.

136
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,732
It's over.

137
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,535
Jake didn't take your pride.

138
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,071
You did that yourself.

139
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:03,043
If life with me is so lousy,
you can always walk away.

140
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,845
Oh, you'd really like
that, wouldn't you?

141
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,981
Things don't work
out, just walk away.

142
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:21,294
I don't love easily, Nick, but
when I do, it means something.

143
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,629
I'm sorry.

144
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:23,630
OK?

145
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,332
Look, just trust me on this.

146
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,967
I know how to beat Jake.

147
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,936
I can show Danny what
no one showed me.

148
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,643
You think you're as
quick as you used to be?

149
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,577
[chuckles]

150
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,381
What I'm going to show Danny has
nothing to do with quickness.

151
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,383
[music playing]

152
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:49,389
[laughter]

153
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,364
Come on, I'll race you.

154
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,372
[music playing]

155
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,978
(WHISPERING) He drops
his left on the jab.

156
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,420
You ready?

157
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,621
What the hell is this?

158
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,223
I thought you were going
to teach me something new.

159
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,058
I beat the hell out of
this guy the other night.

160
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,928
Then this ought to
be a piece of cake.

161
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,304
[music playing]

162
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,115
Look, kid, maybe you
misunderstood me when

163
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,050
I said fight with your head.

164
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,520
I didn't mean lead with it.

165
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,754
Yeah, OK.

166
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,023
So what happened?

167
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,991
It's simple.

168
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,094
I told him how you fight.

169
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,661
What do you mean?

170
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,063
You're predictable.

171
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:10,997
Predictable ?

172
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,599
Yeah?

173
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,334
If I'm so predictable, how come
I'm the light heavyweight champ

174
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,535
of Ohio!

175
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,604
Gee whiz, I forgot
all about that.

176
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,938
[laughs]

177
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,574
Do you forgive me?

178
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,475
So what now?

179
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:28,148
Danny, you got to
learn what to look for

180
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,917
and understand what you see.

181
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,552
You can teach me that?

182
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,656
I told Jimmy how you fight,
and you're 10 times the fighter

183
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,426
he is on his best day.

184
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:43,163
You really think
I'm good, huh?

185
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,498
You're not half as good
as you think you are.

186
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,834
Hey, man, listen,
I don't need this!

187
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,603
You need to
understand something.

188
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:54,374
You could be better
than you ever dreamed.

189
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,176
Maybe better than
anybody I ever seen.

190
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,047
Better than you?

191
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,650
You're going to have to
be if you want to be Jake.

192
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,422
It's your call, kid.

193
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,430
So when do we start?

194
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,102
We just did.

195
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:27,207
[music playing]

196
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,410
What are you doing?
- What?

197
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,944
You got to keep the
guard up, right here.

198
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:32,879
I want to see it here.

199
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:39,952
Come on, you're still open.

200
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,789
I can drive a truck through it.

201
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,757
Ah!

202
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,728
[music playing]

203
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,253
Uh!

204
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,322
How many you done?

205
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,091
Like you said, 50.

206
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,659
You're halfway there.

207
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,594
What?

208
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:42,842
[music playing]

209
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,258
Good.

210
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,027
Now you're thinking.

211
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,696
Now you're thinking.

212
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,631
Good.

213
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:05,565
Keep going.

214
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,499
Hook!

215
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,435
Hook!

216
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,836
Put some hip into it.

217
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,046
All right, so what now?

218
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,849
Throw me a right cross.

219
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,216
Stop.

220
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,052
What would you do
to counter that?

221
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,654
Just swat it away like this.

222
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:28,888
OK.

223
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:32,158
Throw it again.

224
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,926
What about moving five
inches to the right?

225
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,527
Yeah, I will.

226
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,261
I could.

227
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,863
Try again.

228
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,198
Or ducking under, cutting the
guy in half with an uppercut.

229
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,700
Sure, I could do that, too.

230
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,902
Try again.

231
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:43,936
Or just leaning back.

232
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:44,937
Look, I know all this stuff.

233
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,238
I know you do.

234
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,107
All's I'm saying, that
if I'm fighting you

235
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,077
and I'm guessing right most
of the time, most of the time

236
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,213
I'm going to be
kicking your ass.

237
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,882
All right, so what
do you want me to do?

238
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,084
I'm going to come
at you slow at first.

239
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,151
I want you to do
the second thing

240
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,319
that comes into your mind.

241
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,754
The second thing?

242
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,623
That's the thing
after the first, OK?

243
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,633
Think.

244
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,219
Good.

245
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,390
[music playing]

246
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,115
Put it on.

247
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,484
What for?

248
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,019
We're going to try
something new today.

249
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,154
Oh, I see.

250
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,188
You want me to do
the third thing

251
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,458
I think of when you come at me.

252
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,494
I don't want you
to think at all.

253
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,664
You mean not let myself
know what I'm going to do?

254
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,432
Imagine what a
surprise that'd be to me.

255
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:31,043
[music playing]

256
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,313
Hey, Nick!

257
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,681
I'm sorry, man.

258
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,050
I didn't know it was
going to throw that hook.

259
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,984
Neither did I, Danny.

260
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,122
Neither did I.

[music playing]

262
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,471
Thanks.

263
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,243
So, Danny.

264
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,946
Got a girl back home?

265
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,948
No, just mom.

266
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,483
Mom?

267
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,085
Does she know you're here?

268
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,019
Yeah.

269
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,621
She told me to come.

270
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,222
She says dreams don't
wait for people.

271
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:54,827
What about dad?

272
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:01,634
Now dad, his dreams are
always right around the corner.

273
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,036
He used to say, just
wait'll this time next year.

274
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,772
We'll be living in a
place twice this size.

275
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,377
Next year never came.

MAGGIE: You really
want this, don't you?

277
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,783
I mean, for yourself, not just
because Nick wants it for you.

278
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:23,055
I never wanted anything
so bad in my life.

279
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,824
But you know, when I
beat Jake, I'm going

280
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,660
to take a little time off.

281
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,230

that in a long time.

bad for an old man.

move you ever did.

You fought him for
the title in '87.

If you can't beat Fareed,
you got no business in the ring

- How you doing, buddy?

OK.

So this is the kid you think
is going to beat Fareed, huh?

That's what we're
here to find out.

Fareed's getting
ready for Vegas, too.

323
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,461
He's going to need somebody
to break a sweat with him.

Might as well be him.

325
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:27,099
I can pretty much
guarantee that.

at your service.

00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,620
At least I want to put my
money where my mouth is.

How much?

00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,091
$300.

354
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:29,161
Talk about no confidence.

00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,096

So anything I should know?

00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,451
Don't let him grab
you, or sweep you.

362
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:55,121
You don't want to fight this
guy on the ground, remember?

363
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,855
What should I do
if he takes me down?

364
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,424
Don't resist.

365
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,426
It's important.

366
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,394
I've seen him break
a guy's elbow once.

367
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,562
What should I do?

368
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,531
You can beat him
at his own game.

00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,867
He takes you down, counter him.

370
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:11,837
You got it?

371
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:13,839
I got it.

372
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,007
Show me.

373
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:39,365
[music playing]

374
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:04,116
Whoo!

375
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:47,793
Yes!

376
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,362
Ha-ha!

377
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,763
Yes!

378
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,432
Yes!

379
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,366
Whoo!

380
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,367
All right!

381
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,369
[laughter]

382
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,145
That makes $2,000.

383
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,314
I, uh, hope we worked
up enough sweat to make

384
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,015
it worthwhile for your boy.

385
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:11,550
Um-hum.

386
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,420
I guess I'm going to have to
ask him whenever he gets up.

387
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,023
What are you going to
do with the kid, Nicky?

388
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:22,060
He says he wants to be
champion of the world.

389
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,363
I'll see you in Vegas, Stevie.

390
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,732
Yeah.

391
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,768
What was that all about?

392
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,702
Expense money.

393
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,410
What's this for?

394
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,011
It's your cut.

395
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,514
You earned it.

396
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,515
Let's go.

397
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,429
[music playing]

398
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:24,756
[laughs]

399
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,392
I just confirmed
things with Sal.

400
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,960
You got two fights
tomorrow, pal.

401
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,895
Tomorrow?

402
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,830
That's right.

403
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,965
Hey, to Vegas, huh?

404
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:38,003
And the championships!

405
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,571
MAGGIE: To winning.

406
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,876
You guys, I got to
take a look around.

407
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,912
I've never been to Vegas before.

408
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,714
That's a good idea.

409
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,850
You know, the volcano goes off
in the Mirage in 10 minutes.

410
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,219
Really?

411
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,353
I'll see you guys later.

412
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,558
I was kidding.

413
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,827
He trusts you.

414
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:05,331
Oh, why shouldn't he?

415
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:09,935
Don't let him get hurt, Nick.

416
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,938
I won't.

417
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,873
I promise.

418
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,309
Cross my heart, hope to die.

419
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:28,687
[music playing]

420
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,575
Oh, you get him, baby!

421
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,576
Oh, yeah!

422
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,854
Come on, get up.

423
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:15,166
Where'd you get this bum?

424
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,768
Come on, man.

425
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:17,769
Come on.

426
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,310
Hey, what'd you think?

427
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,182
You're looking good, baby.

428
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,784
You're looking real good.

429
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,423
You're somebody that
appreciates talent.

430
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,840
OK, so we're here.

431
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,974
What's the big news?

432
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,509
Sal called this afternoon.

433
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,812
He wants to know if we want
to go into Vegas a day early.

434
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,181
ESPN is doing the TV
for the tournament,

435
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,951
and he's got this promo
he wants us to do.

436
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:09,321
It'll put a feather in his cap,
and get you some publicity.

437
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,122
Sure, no sweat.

438
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,057
Lovely.

439
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:12,991
I told him--

440
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,225
$10,000 a day.

441
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,361
$10,000 a day?

442
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,895
What are you, sick or what, man?

443
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,730
The guy guaranteed you $100,000.

444
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,099
That's more than anybody
ever got in this sport.

445
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,334
I said I'd do it.

446
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,069
What more does the guy want?

447
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,236
Blood?

448
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,838
Oh, you must
have got Alzheimer.

449
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,674
Don't you remember the guy took
care of us when we were busted

450
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:32,010
and down and out, and
things weren't so good?

451
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,479
Hey, look, Joe.

452
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,281
I'm in the fighting business,
not the favor business.

453
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:37,783
But if it makes you
feel uncomfortable--

454
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,718
OK, OK.

455
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,019
I'll tell him.

456
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,690
Oh, Sal said that Nick
Taylor was in Stevie's gym

457
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,291
this afternoon.

458
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,793
He's still alive?

459
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:48,960
The word's out.

460
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,662
Nick's training this
young kid, and Stevie said

461
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,064
he's going to be a great one.

462
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,067
I hope he's better than Nicky.

463
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,603
JIM MCGRAW: Good afternoon.

464
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,671
This is Gentleman
Jim McGraw coming

465
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:03,442
to you live from the Sands
Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

466
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,711
It's no secret that
champion Jake Gerrard

467
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:08,447
is the clear favorite with
all other fighters still

468
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,982
trying to prove that they
belong in the same ring

469
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,884
with the champ.

470
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,386
How you doing?

471
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,388
Nervous, man.

472
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,289
Listen to me, Danny.

473
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,358
How many people you
think get a shot?

474
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,293
I mean, a real shot at
their dreams in this life?

475
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,262
Maybe one in a million?

476
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,697
Now I never trained
anybody before,

477
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:28,133
and the only reason
I trained you

478
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,635
is because I know
you got a shot.

479
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,976
I'm proud of you, man.

480
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,245
Win or lose?

481
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,481
I didn't say that.

482
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,517
JIM MCGRAW: If anyone has
a chance against Gerrard,

483
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,586
it figures to be
number one contender

484
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:52,323
Jackie Clark whose aerial antics
are the talk of the sport.

485
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,926
Our first fight of the
day pits Jose Gonzalez,

486
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:58,697
ranked number nine in the world,
against the unranked Danny

487
00:39:58,797 --> 00:39:59,397
Davis.

488
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,967
And here we go!

489
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:02,968

Come on!

493
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,287
All right, break it up.

494
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,290
Come on, get over there!

495
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,461
[cheering]

496
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:39,991
Yeah!

497
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:43,995
[cheering]

498
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,167
I beat Gonzalez, Nick!

499
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,368
I beat Gonzalez!

500
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,402
Yeah.

501
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,371
But you're still not the champ.

502
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,540
Oh, not yet.

503
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:59,577
[cheering]

504
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,914
MAGGIE: [laughs]

505
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,283
Come on, you're tickling me.

506
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:33,478
Feels like old times.

507
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:34,846
I never should
have quit fighting.

508
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:38,283
You made the right decision.

509
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,254
It's what I do best.

510
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:51,429
You're good at other things.

511
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,398
The club is doing great.

512
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,634
Yeah, but that's a business.

513
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:59,871
Fighting is my passion.

514
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,073
It's the only thing I
ever gave a damn about.

515
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,546
The only thing?

516
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,681
Except you.

517
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:25,030
I love you, Nick.

518
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,265
I always have.

519
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,234
And I always will.

520
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,616
Did you hear what I just said?

521
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:46,752
Yeah.

522
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,894
ANNOUNCER: And in
the blue corner,

523
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,330

California, weighing

524
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,069
in at 176 pounds, he is the
light heavyweight champion

525
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:05,003
of the world.

526
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:08,573
Introducing Jiltin'
Jake Gerrard!

527
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:12,778
[booing]

528
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,987
I want you get him
right off the get go.

529
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:23,721
Sucker punch him
right off the clinch.

530
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:24,689
- OK.
- Are you ready?

531
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,857
- Yeah.
- Are you ready!

532
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,292
- Yeah!
- What are you going to do?

533
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,459
- I'm going to kill him!
- What are you going to do?

534
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,694
I'm going to kill him!

535
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:30,561
Then go in there
and get the bastard!

539
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,105
Did I miss anything?

540
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:18,343
Nothing you couldn't see
in the local slaughterhouse.

541
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,319
What are you doing?

542
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:30,355
I just want to go, OK?

543
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:31,256
OK.

545
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,143
You ever watch
Jake fight before?

546
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,881
It's the first time in person.

547
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,015
Go to school, kid.

548
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:12,363
Boo, Jake!

549
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:57,642
[cheers and boos]

550
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:10,588
Yeah!

551
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,273
Want to play a
little blackjack?

552

It's a counting system.

No kidding.

Sir, will you put the money
down on the table, please.

00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,011
Sorry.

I want to double down.

You're going to
double down on 12?

You're doubling down on 12?

Yeah, I'm going to
go up in a few minutes.

Sure you don't know anything
more about this guy?

All I know is if you
want a shot at Jake,

609
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,599
you got to beat this guy.

So fake him, four times.

I'll never touch him.

He's jumping all over
the place, all right?

He's theatrical.

630
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,303
Just fake him three, four
times, nail him with heel kicks.

You hear that sound?

You hear that?

651
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,854
It's the sound of
those lips quivering

652
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:07,124
for one of my magical
macadamia morsels.

653
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:12,162
They just lay in my tray all
day and go, eat me, eat me.

They're so lonely.

Why, 30 minutes after you've
had one, whisker lips,

It's just this
whole thing, Nick.

It's Vegas, it's
Jake, it's Danny.

You'd stand a better chance
if you faced them head on.

Jake's the one that
put me on crutches.

For six months.

739
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:28,946
World champion, my ass.

[knock on door]

743
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:52,702
Surprise.

744
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:54,438
Can I come in?

745
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:55,372
Sure.

746
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,587
You OK?

747
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:12,056
I've been better.

748
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,994
You want to sit-- sit down?

749
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:23,200
I need some fresh air.

750
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,370
I need another one.

751
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,339
I don't think so.

752
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:04,341
You're drunk.

753
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,110
I'm lonely.

754
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,712
I haven't been drunk
in years, but I've

755
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:11,081
been lonely for a long time.

756
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,885
I think you need some coffee.

757
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,320
That's not what I need.

758
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,088
I don't think you need
to do something you're

759
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,625
going to regret tomorrow.

760
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,027
I like you, Danny.

761
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:25,930
You're the hero,
Nick used to be.

762
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,899
No, it's not easy being
the champ and then--

763
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,467
Then what!

764
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:31,936
A bitter old drunk?

765
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:34,671
Is that what you
were going to say?

766
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,640
He doesn't need
you to defend him.

767
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:54,959
The son of a bitch picked
up a whole in a bar.

768
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,532
I can't believe he
would do this to me.

769
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,506
I love him.

770
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,479
I love him so much.

Danny?

774
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:55,585
Open up, man.

775
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:58,788
Hey.

776
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,459
Hey, what's up, man?

777
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,727
Uh--

778
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:04,761
What's going on?

779
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:06,696
I just wanted to talk to you.

780
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,597
Why?

781
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,200
What's up?

782
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,470
Because I fucked
up big time tonight.

783
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:14,938
Look, it's 3:00
in the morning, man.

784
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:15,872
I got a fight tomorrow.

785
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:16,973
I got to get some sleep.

786
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,577
Oh.
I'm sorry.

787
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:21,611
- It's all right.
- Yeah.

788
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,683
Get some sleep.
- I will, man.

789
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:27,617
Thanks.

790
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,486
Uh, did you see Maggie?

791
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:31,188
Nick, I--

792
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:31,921
Nick!

793
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,824
You bitch.

794
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,893
You lying, fucking bitch.

795
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,462
Hey, man!

796
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,730
What are you doing?

797
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,234
You think Maggie and I--

798
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,869
Jesus, man, I think
you better leave.

799
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:48,872
I'm sorry.

800
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,474
I'm sorry.

Maggie?

Maggie, where are you going?

809
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:03,760
I'm leaving, Nick.

810
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,295
Well, OK, I--

811
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:06,563
I understand.

812
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:08,865
Look, after the
tournament, I'll come back

813
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,867
and we can talk about it.

814
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,101
I'm leaving you.

815
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,703
Maggie.

816
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:15,305
If it's about that
girl tonight--

817
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:18,442
It has nothing to
do with that girl.

818
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,043
We've had 100
nights like tonight.

819
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:24,047
Maybe not quite as dramatic, but
you just didn't seem to notice.

820
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:26,583
I'm tired of making
excuses for you.

821
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:29,218
I'm tired of making
excuses for myself.

822
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:30,253
Maggie, don't.

823
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:32,021
Maggie.

824
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,990
Don't leave.

825
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,960
I could change.

826
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:40,364
I need you.

827
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:41,398
You don't need me, Nick.

828
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:43,199
You need yourself.

829
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:47,904
You get that back, call me.

830
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,473
The airport, please.

831
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,328
NICK: Hey, Danny.

832
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:23,940
I'm sorry about everything
that happened last night.

833
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:28,412
Yeah well, let's just
forget about it, OK?

834
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,353
I haven't been
honest with you.

835
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:44,127
I haven't been honest with
anybody lately, especially

836
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:46,229
myself.

837
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:47,363
NICK: What do you mean?

838
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,402
I've been using you.

839
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:58,742
I didn't care if you won
the championship or not.

840
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:01,110
I just-- I wanted
somebody to beat Jake.

841
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,115
I wanted revenge.

842
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,622
And you're the only guy I
ever met who had a prayer.

843
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,094
The way I look at, we were
using each other, you know?

844
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:25,602
I guess what I'm trying
to say is, is that is

845
01:13:25,702 --> 01:13:29,372
my fight with Jake, Danny.

846
01:13:29,473 --> 01:13:30,874
And you can walk away any time.

847
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:36,646
I understand.

848
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,747
I'm not sure you do.

849
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:44,988
I don't want to see you
get hurt because of me.

850
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,591
I don't want to see
you get hurt period.

851
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:56,700
I'm not walking away without
that championship belt. No way.

01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,577
ANNOUNCER: Quite frankly, fans,
the story of this tournament

853
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:09,513
can be summed up in two words--

854
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:11,815
Danny Davis.

855
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:14,751
Most fans are looking forward
to tomorrow's championship fight

856
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:17,621
but there's a great deal of
money and prestige on the line

857
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:19,155
tonight for third
and fourth place

858
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:22,058
with several top ranked fighters
needing a strong showing.

859
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,461
Ronnie Martin's looked good so
far in deserving of his number

01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:43,232
I want you to come at me hard.

875
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,334
You're kidding, right?

876
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,471
I'm still the teacher, right?

877
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:49,605
That you are.

878
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,112
Let's go.

879
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,106
Hey man, you let me do that.

880
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:24,040
Why?

881
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:29,212
I wanted to see if I
can still take a shot.

882
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,782
Thanks.

Can I ask you something?

886
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:07,751
Why are you doing this?

887
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:09,185
Because I got to.

888
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:11,087
You can't beat Jake.

889
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,723
That's what I need,
Stevie, positive thinking.

890
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:16,692
Yeah, well, I'm positive
that you can't beat him.

891
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:26,202
Look, is there any way that I
can talk to you out of this?

892
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:27,136
Nope.

893
01:18:31,474 --> 01:18:32,742
You got any money on this fight?

894
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,080

Now everybody listen up.

This is the way this
fight's comin' down.

899
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:56,065
There ain't no rules,
there ain't no rounds,

900
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:58,634
and there ain't no time limit.

901
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,037
The winner is the guy
that's left standing,

902
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:03,572
and the loser is the
guy that can't get up

903

or is unable to continue.

01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:07,676

Yeah, sure.

What's wrong?

He's fighting Jake tonight,
and you're the only one that--

923
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:12,541
Fight?

924
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:13,576
What fight?

925
01:20:13,676 --> 01:20:14,543
Oh, God.

926
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,245
I didn't think you knew.

927
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:17,680
Come on, I'll tell
you on the way.

928

Let's go.

929
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,890
Nick's fighting Jake in
the Neon Graveyard tonight.

930
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,425
The association would never
sanction a bout like that.

931
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:32,695
This isn't an official fight.

932
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,830
Jake's going to kill him.

933
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:37,300
You're the only
one who can stop him.

Oh!

938
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:12,635
Ah!

939
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,637

Easy, boy.

946
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,611
You go in there, you
get your ass kicked.

947
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:56,579
Ah!

948
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:00,583

949
01:22:03,953 --> 01:22:05,688

You've got to stop this fight!

951
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:09,692
I with I could, but I can't.

952
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:13,496
If you really want to be a
right guy, go call an ambulance.

(WEAKLY) You came back.

960
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:52,521
I'm here baby, I'm
not going anywhere.

961
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,095
I love you.

962
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,102
Did you hear me?

963
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:12,475
I love you, too.

964
01:25:24,587 --> 01:25:25,454
Hey, Danny.

965
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:32,261
How you doing?

I learned something tonight.

969
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:58,287
Something I should have
learned a long time ago.

970
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:08,864
Winning is not
about getting even.

971
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:18,507
It's about being
true to yourself.

972
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:30,419
Get a doctor.

973
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,055
Hurry.

974
01:26:33,155 --> 01:26:34,156
Hang on, baby.

Danny, I want you to
promise me something.

986
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:52,801
What?

987
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:57,706
Promise me you won't fight Jake.

988
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:05,348
I can't promise you that.

989
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,654
That maniac murdered Nick.

990
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,626
Don't make me cry for you, too.

[music playing]

992
01:28:22,998 --> 01:28:25,067
I can't.

993
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:26,702
You can, but you won't.

994
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,844

I'm the champion.

1001

Don't worry about it.

1002
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:07,470
Get your head into the fight.

Cassidy out there.

1004
