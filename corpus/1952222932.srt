00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,900
that's sure to come.

527
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,420
They'll dismantle us all.

528
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,100
l say we get rid of them.

529
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,460
Before the recyclers get rid of US.

530
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,500
We can't just send them out
to be slaughtered.

531
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,060
We don't owe them anything!

532
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,450
Yes, we do. He's a creator.

533
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,980
42.957% of the units
walking around this town

534
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,096
were built from his designs.

535
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,740
Each and every one of us
owe our existence to this man

536
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,219
or someone like him.

537
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,300
ELEXlA: And what about her?

538
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,700
Yes, she's a cyborg,

539
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,980
but something incredible
is happening here

540
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,175
and every one of us knows it.

541
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,900
She is the first of our kind
to become one of their kind.

542
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,900
We're all part creator
because of her -

543
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,856
and that makes me feel proud.

544
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,608
She is living proof that
we are not just a machine.

545
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,332
She is our future.

546
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,493
lf she dies, we all die.

547
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,932
We must protect her
to save ourselves.

548
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,579
Can you help her?

549
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,460
l want to thank you, my friends, for
showing up on such a short notice

550
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,460
and l see you're all here.

551
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:59,500
Johnny and Jimmy O'Hara -
how's things in Silica, eh?

552
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,340
And Jean-Pierre.

553
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,060
l see you brought all your bad boys.
Excellent.

554
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,500
And, Gunther, you redesigned
those slaughter wheels, eh?

555
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,020
GUNTHER:
The more firepower, the better!

556
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,380
MEN: Yeah!

557
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,020
Good. We're going to need it.

558
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,660
But first, gentlemen, let's get
down to the business at hand.

559
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,580
Over those hills lies a treasure
beyond your wildest imagination.

560
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,580
Now, you've all heard of it
and you've longed for it.

561
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,660
Yet most of you doubted
that it ever even existed.

562
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,060
Yet l alone found it

563
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,900
and together we're gonna
share in the wealth.

564
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,020
MAN: What are you yapping about,
Lewellyn?

565
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,700
Cytown, my boy.
The capital of the free zone.

566
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,060
A metropolis of unowned cyborgs
just wandering around,

567
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,096
clear and free.

568
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,860
Easy pickings, eh?

569
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,940
MAN:
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

570
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,500
MEN: Yeah!

571
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,980
No, hold on, not just yet.

572
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,980
There's still some loose ends
that gotta be tied up.

573
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,940
Meanwhile, Jocko and l have acquired
some of Silica's finest brandy

574
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,540
and there's plenty for all.

575
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,340
So we'd like to ask you lads
if you'd like to join us

576
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,820
in a wee bit of a drink
before the slaughter, eh?

577
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,495
(Men whoop and cheer)

578
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,540
This is as close to a lab
as we've got.

579
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,020
lt'll have to do.

580
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,854
A pregnant cyborg -
it makes you think.

581
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,620
Do any of these surgical gear work?

582
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,380
Well, we don't know.

583
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,820
We've collected tons of junk
from around the zone,

584
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,300
but, then again, we're not creators.

585
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,733
What about that?

586
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,340
Force-field's core.

587
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,620
Here as long as any
of us can remember.

588
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,260
Created by the founders
of Cytown for protection.

589
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,020
Advanced units, l imagine.

590
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,740
Well, as a manner of speaking. . .

591
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,050
Then again, they didn't give us
the ability to fix ourselves.

592
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,060
Most humans don't
possess that ability.

593
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,140
lt takes a vision
that very few possess.

594
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,740
l have a vision.

595
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,620
l dream of one day
being able to stand on legs.

596
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,372
To walk again.

597
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,340
Doc, you think maybe you could
help an old unit who's. . .

598
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:08,458
Sure, Hale, of course.
l'll do my best.

599
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,058
You're not the only one
with a dream.

600
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,980
Do you know what it's like
to be programmed to be a hero

601
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,857
and not have the ability to fight?

602
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,020
l still have sensations in my
trigger fingers that aren't there.

603
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,940
l know. l know what it's like.

604
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,060
Just once to hold a sword
in my hand again

605
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,500
and fight the way l once did.

606
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,860
There was a time
l lived to build cyborgs.

607
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,693
l was in awe of what
you could accomplish.

608
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,857
Faster, stronger - more perfect
than l ever dreamed of being.

609
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,411
l envied every single one of you.

610
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,975
l haven't felt that way
in a long time.

611
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,260
Arggh! Ohh!

612
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,740
Quick - get her up.

613
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,060
(Cash cries)

614
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,573
What's happening?
Help me!

615
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,820
Guys, you're gonna have to clear out

616
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,540
and give me some room to work,
please.

617
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,373
Not you, Decaf.
You stay and connect her.

618
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,697
(Cash cries out)

619
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,980
Oh, my God. l don't believe it.

620
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,540
What is it?

621
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,740
She's going into some kind of labour.

622
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,413
But how can that be? She's only
been pregnant a few weeks.

623
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,380
Cash, try and relax.

624
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,460
Shut down all non-essential systems.

625
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,893
Trust me to get you through this.

626
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,900
Something is definitely wrong.

627
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,380
What will you do?

628
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,820
l don't know.
We're gonna have to open her up.

629
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,060
Evans, please.

630
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,780
Evans, please. . .

631
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,418
Cash, relax.

632
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,418
OK, release your abdominal plate now.

633
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,540
Doc, what is it?

634
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,220
lt's the end of the first trimester.

635
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,820
A baby?

636
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,378
A miracle.

637
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,372
(Men exclaim)

638
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,058
You OK?
Yeah.

639
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,100
Come on, get up.
(Man groans)

640
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,136
Oh, that hurts, man.

641
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,740
Lewellyn, we've found
the force-field.

642
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,617
lt fried the bikes, so we're walking.

643
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,212
Come on, let's go.

644
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,938
Come on, come on.

645
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,740
Where's the baby?

646
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,412
Yeah, we wanna see the baby.

647
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,540
The baby is still in the incubator.

648
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,019
Well, bring him out.

649
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,978
He's beautiful.

650
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,540
When's he gonna
come out of that thing?

651
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,060
Uh, not for a few months.

652
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,860
lt's a womb with a view.

653
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,136
Cash, what does it feel like?

654
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,700
There's no program for it.

655
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,340
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to us.

656
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,860
No, it's not!

657
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,580
lt's the worst.

658
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,660
lt'll be the end of us all.

659
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,580
They're gonna come for it

660
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,900
and they'll take us
all down to get it.

661
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,420
Yeah, when that time comes,

662
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,180
we'll just have
to be ready to fight.

663
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,180
With what? Hooks and claws?

664
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,020
Wheelchairs and canes?

665
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,817
l don't think so!

666
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,220
Look, Jocko, we've got
to get beyond that force-field.

667
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,540
You're the only one
that can get close enough

668
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,340
to find it and bring it down.

669
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,300
They'll never suspect
a cyborg coming in on foot.

670
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,131
Just be one of them.

671
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,180
Why?

672
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,460
Well, it's nothing personal.

673
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,894
Now you're a freak like them!

674
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,740
WOMAN: What's he?

675
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,140
MAN: That's a series 2000 -
he's a warrior.

676
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,529
That's cool, no problem.
So, anyway. . .

677
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,692
Hey, it's the orb.

678
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,099
( DOOR RATTLES )

679
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,895
What'd you bring me?
Look inside.

680
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:50,220
The baby? Outstanding, Jocko.

681
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,609
They've gotta come after this.

682
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,500
Cytown. . . is gonna be mine.

683
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,049
And, Jocko -
not a word to the others.

684
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,740
What are we supposed to do -
glue it back together?

685
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,620
None of us knows
how to repair the force-field.

686
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,980
The founders gave us
more credit than we deserve.

687
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,820
Cash is gone. So is her gear.

688
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,340
Forget about her.
We got bigger problems.

689
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:17,860
The force-field's down

690
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,860
and the way l see it,
it's all your fault.

691
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:23,100
Doc can fix it, can't you, Doc?

692
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,580
l don't know.

693
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,180
l don't know.
The technology is so different.

694
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,420
You don't have any schematics
or back-up gear?

695
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,900
Lost to the ages.

696
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,620
Like l said, the force-field's
been here longer than any of us.

697
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,500
l knew this was gonna happen.

698
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,980
We're doomed.

699
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,460
Now there's nothing
to stop the humans

700
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,940
from coming in here
with their machines.

701
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,580
Forget about the force-field!

702
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,060
You're not gonna bring that back!

703
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,340
You people don't seem
to get it, do you?

704
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,060
The future of your entire race
depends on Cash and the baby!

705
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,700
You've gotta bring 'em back!

706
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,900
He's right. We gotta find them.

707
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,780
Look, if Cash doesn't reach
that canister in time,

708
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,740
the baby is finished -
it's pure and simple!

709
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,220
l say we round up
every fighting unit in town

710
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,017
and we take them on head to head.

711
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,940
Odds of victory
implementing that plan are 0%.

712
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,976
Well, l think l can
improve those odds.

713
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,220
Fix the force-field, human -
or we're doomed!

714
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,089
Maybe l can fix it.
l'll do what l can. . .cyborg.

715
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,816
( FLOOR CREAKS )

716
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,812
( BOOM ! )

717
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,900
Rise and shine, lovey.

718
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:13,339
Now, tell me - what were you doing
trespassing on my vehicle, eh?

719
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,500
Where's my baby?

720
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,934
The little rodent is just fine.

721
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,740
Ah, you see, Jocko,

722
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:26,260
how refined the mothering
instinct is in this programming.

723
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,380
Touching, eh?

724
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,531
l wonder if we could
find out just how you work.

725
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,100
l'm not afraid.

726
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,580
Do what you want.

727
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:39,220
Oh, no, no, no. Not quite yet.

728
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,300
These goods are much too valuable.

729
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,940
l'm just gonna have to find me
another toy in Cytown.

730
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,980
l'm what you came for.

731
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,540
Just keep me.
There's nothing else for you there.

732
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,100
How naive.
You're just the tip of the iceberg.

733
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,860
Before l'm through,

734
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:59,092
l'm gonna have my way with
every one of you simple machines.

735
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,460
Make no mistake about it -

736
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,580
l'm the meanest bastard
you'll ever meet, cyborg or human.

737
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:14,740
You push me and no matter how much
you're worth, l'll wipe your memory

738
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,900
and make you a pleasure unit.

739
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,209
My own pleasure unit.

740
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,740
Jocko, watch our inventory.

741
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,379
More to follow, darling.

742
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,580
How can you betray your own kind?

743
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:46,060
Lewellyn is my kind.

744
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,020
No! You see what he is, what he does!

745
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,460
lt's what l do.

746
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,420
ls it really?

747
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,572
Try to remember what you were
before he wiped your memory.

748
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,580
lt doesn't matter.

749
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:07,340
Lewellyn owns me now.

750
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,740
Are you just taking orders?

751
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,700
How long will that last?
You will be next!

752
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,220
Don't you see?

753
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:18,820
As soon as your parts become more
valuable than your services,

754
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,780
he will take pleasure in ripping out
your eyes and selling you for scrap.

Let me help you.

Connect with me.

..9/27 /21 46.

767
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,500
Jacques, you were stolen!

768
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,620
You used to save lives.
Do you remember?

769
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,860
l don't know how anymore.

770
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,780
l can teach you.

771
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,010
Take me to my baby.

772
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,740
l can't.

773
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,860
Lewellyn would shut me down.

774
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,900
Jacques, l'm afraid too.

775
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,860
l'm afraid my baby's going to die.

776
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,020
Please help me save him.

777
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,137
lt's what you were programmed to do.

778
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,017
l don't want him to die.

779
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,614
(Sings)  l don't care.

780
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,017

781
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,452
l'm no cyborg.

01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,210
l'M NO C YBORG!

783
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:50,892
l'm no cyborg yet!

784

l'm a human being.

785
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,212
l'm a human being.

786
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,700
l'd forgotten l was programmed
to imagine such a possibility.

787
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,940
lt feels good, doesn't it?

788
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,420
Yes.

789
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,860
My, my, my!

790
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,100
l spy with my good eye that one
of us might need a tune-up, eh?

791
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,491
Cross me again, Jocko, and l'll sell
your carcass to the highest bidder.

792
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,813
Arggh!

793
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,092
Stop her! Stop her!

794
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,978
Recycle that.

795
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,011
Come on. l'm gonna
get you out of here.

796
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:12,180
l would imagine they will try
and come in through this canyon here

797
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,660
because it has the lowest. . .

798
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,660
Thank God! Are you alright?
How's the baby?

799
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,537
We've both lost a lot of fluid.

800
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,180
Yeah, you're too weak
to transfuse now.

801
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,780
We're gonna have
to hold off until later.

802
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,420
Look, he's coming
and he is not alone.

803
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,180
He's built a strike force.

804
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:33,540
His jump ship, a few sand rails
and desert bikes at least 50-strong.

805
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,380
And he's not just coming for me.

806
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:40,540
He wants us all, dead or alive.

807
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,380
They're not taking me alive.

808
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,500
l'm never going back.

809
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,100
She's right. This is our home.

810
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,380
lf there's to be a next generation,

811
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,140
we have to make a stand.

812
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,291
We all have to fight. . .together.

813
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,300
Alright, gentlemen, listen up.
Here's our strategy.

814
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,380
Jean-Pierre, you and your lads
will come in from the east.

815
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,060
Gunther, you and your boys
will come up from the south.

816
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,780
Meanwhile, Jocko and l will
roar down from the north.

817
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,500
We'll all meet
in the middle of the dry lake bed

818
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:14,620
and then we'll converge on Cytown
like a tongue of fire from hell!

819
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:17,460
We'll take them by surprise.
They'll never know what hit them.

820
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,100
But keep one thing in mind -

821
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,140
the bitch and the canister,
they belong to me.

822
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,780
(Men whoop and cheer)

823
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,660
Hale, are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

824
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,700
We've come too far
to turn back now.

825
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,140
But we took an oath.

826
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,778
We never took an oath to die.

827
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,537
Show 'em, El Sid.

828
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,500
That's a significant
amount of firepower.

829
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,219
We've had a lot
of unwelcome visitors.

830
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,295
ls all of this weaponry?
HALE: ln a manner of speaking.

831
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,775
Cyborgs don't exactly
bury their dead.

832
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,291
A cyborg graveyard.

833
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:20,140
OK, Sid. Just hold still one second.

834
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,220
Almost there. (Grunts) OK.

835
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,020
Oh, this is so exciting, Doc.

836
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,580
How's the arm feel?

837
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,980
lt feels good. lt feels strong.

838
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,300
Stronger than the original, l think.

839
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,740
All you need is a synthetic
flesh sleeve. You'll be fine.

840
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,412
Great!

01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,260
Now, we have a slight problem.

843
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,218
You're a 260 series,
l could only find a 240 limb, so. . .

01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,220
Ugh!

the swivel valve or the joint, l . . .

846
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,780
l'm sorry, Hale, l just. . .
l don't. . . l can't do it.

847
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,380
lt's OK, Doc. You did your best.

848
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,900
Don't worry about my hands, Doc.

849
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,016
Just weld these into my servos.

850
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,260
How's that?

851
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,693
Let's see.

852
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,858
Good job, men.

her eyes about my neck.

01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,220
This is the free zone.

874
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,495
Have you lost your bloody head?

875
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,700
l could kill you right now.

876
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,340
Now, don't force me to.

877
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,380
Now drop that goddamn gun,
metal head!

878
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,371
l said, ''Drop it.''

879
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,613
Drop it!

880
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,820
Now, listen up.

881
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:16,820
Baby and l,
we're gonna take our leave

882
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:21,060
and if any of you wretched
androids make one move,

883
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,020
l'm gonna destroy this canister.

884
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,820
Go ahead. Take it.

885
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,180
Destroy the canister.
Do what you want.

886
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,260
We can't all sacrifice
our lives for one baby.

887
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,740
What are you saying?

888
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,660
What's the difference?

889
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,380
Why should a child live in a world

890
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,300
where his parts
are worth more than he is?

891
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,660
Where eyes are worn like jewellery
and life means nothing.

892
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:47,540
Please, have mercy on my baby.

893
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,900
Destroy the canister.

894
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,020
WOMAN: Cash, no!

895
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:55,380
You're bluffing.

896
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,770
Take a good look at the future,
Recycler.

897
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,780
(Gasps) Sweet mother of God.

898
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,931
The bitch has got some
interesting programming.

899
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,455
Come on, quickly.
We haven't much time - follow me.

900
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,619
lt was the only place to keep
the temperature under control.

901
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,620
l'm not one of a kind,

902
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,340
just the only one to survive. . .

903
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,217
..so far.

904
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,460
CASH: The dark time was over

905
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,258
and a new, golden age
was about to begin.
