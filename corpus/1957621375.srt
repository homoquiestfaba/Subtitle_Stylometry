1
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:03,903
(soft music)

2
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:14,866
(gentle music)

3
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:24,571
(bright music)

4
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:29,770
- [Nora Voiceover] It had been a long,

5
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,778
hard winter for me and the old man

6
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:35,611
and all the other wandering souls.

7
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:41,165
But for my father, there
was always hope in movement.

8
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,136
(bright music)

9
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:46,266
So once again we hopped into the only home

10
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,771
I'd ever known and moved on.

11
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,998
(bright music)

12
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:56,951
The long road took us to a
place I'd never been before.

13
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,966
It seemed like the end of the earth,

14
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,670
but to my father, somewhere in the strange

15
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,851
and haunting land there was promise.

16
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:08,434
(gentle music)

17
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:16,373
- Maybe we'll sleep
under the stars tonight.

18
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:18,456
A lot of stars down here.

19
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:21,502
How does that sound?

20
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:22,335
- Okay.

21
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,810
(bright music)

22
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,036
- [Nora Voiceover] Geez.

23
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,831
Where are we?

24
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,414
(bright music)

25
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:41,331
- Been a long couple of days, huh?

26
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,118
Night, kid.

27
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,118
- Goodnight.

28
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:48,443
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

29
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,987
- Should be so lucky.

30
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:58,665
(cricket chirping)
(coyote howling)

31
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:04,847
- [Nora Voiceover] I
remember hearing the coyotes.

32
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:06,349
Such a sad cry.

33
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,464
(coyotes howling)

34
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,631
Maybe they too were tired of the road.

35
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,402
But now I know they were calling to us.

36
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:20,271
Watch out, they were saying.

37
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:25,021
There's a road ahead that will
change your lives forever.

38
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:31,122
(gentle music)

39
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,106
- It's beautiful.

40
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,463
- Have I ever let you down?

41
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:20,396
Thank you.

42
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:30,223
It's called (speaks in foreign language).

43
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:31,640
The bay of souls.

44
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:39,295
When I was here, used to
work the charter boats.

45
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,424
Used to come down here at winters

46
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,724
just a little bit further down the coast.

47
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,557
A place called Laredo.

48
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:50,388
Used to take the rich gringos out fishing.

49
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:53,138
Who knows?

50
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:56,373
Maybe be the winter place again.

51
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,792
This thing with Scully works out.

52
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:02,466
- That would be cool if it does work out.

53
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,299
- Oh yeah.

54
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,252
It's solid.

55
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,555
Yeah, it's solid.

56
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,722
I can feel it.

57
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:16,901
- Thanks.

58
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,867
Aren't you hungry?

59
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,521
- Nah.

60
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,438
I can't eat that stuff.

61
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,568
You know my body's my temple.

62
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:30,604
- Well, you gotta have protein.

63
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:33,187
- I got protein to spare, Nora.

64
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:36,344
- We're busted, aren't we?

65
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:38,620
- No.

66
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,682
No, we're all right.

67
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:40,849
We'll be fine.

68
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:43,292
- [Nora Voiceover] There it is.

69
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,578
The nose scratch.

70
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,661
Every time he tells a lie,
he scratches his nose.

71
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,518
Geez, there he goes again.

72
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,518
We must really be broke.

73
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:58,428
(bright music)

74
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:10,659
(singing in foreign language)

75
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,601
- Well, I don't see Scully's boat.

76
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,867
- Maybe he's still out there fishing.

77
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,161
- Oh yeah, that's it.

78
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,161
- Goop time.

79
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:27,059
- It's really just as well, Nora,

80
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,133
because there's some people
I really need to see.

81
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:29,966
- Friends?

82
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:30,799
- Yeah.

83
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,615
- Old friends?

84
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:33,448
- Oh yeah.

85
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,124
They're the people I used to stay with

86
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,124
when I worked down here.

87
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,480
They run a small hotel for fishermen.

88
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,313
The Oasis.

89
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:00,200
It was kind of a second home.

90
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,280
Get up a little motor on that, Cheo.

91
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,582
- Shep, hi.

92
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:07,415
Hi.

93
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:10,721
- Hey, you've had the same old engine

94
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:11,858
for what 15 years now?

95
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,473
- 20 years.

96
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,049
- It still doesn't run.

97
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:16,774
I think you were pulling
on that cord when I left.

98
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,760
- [Cheo] I think so, too.

99
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,111
- You look good, Cheo.

100
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:21,562
You haven't aged a bit.

101
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:23,148
You're a little fatter is all.

102
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:23,981
- Oh.

103
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,345
(speaking in a foreign language)

104
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,853
- [Graciela] Shep?

105
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,686
- [Shep] Hey old girl.

106
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,345
- Shame, shame, shame.

107
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,561
- I know, I know.

108
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:34,394
I know.

109
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,227
- How long has it been?

110
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,060
10 years?

111
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:38,405
(speaks in a foreign language) No.

112
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:40,594
It's been so much longer than that.

113
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:41,427
Bad boy.

114
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:45,013
- I do have an excuse.

115
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:47,051
I picked up a stray.

116
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,487
Can't wander quite as far as I used to.

117
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,109
- Hi, I'm Nora, the stray.

118
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:52,758
(speaking in a foreign language)

119
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,259
- Don't tell me she's your daughter.

120
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:56,364
- That she is.

121
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:57,803
- Hello, Nora.

122
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm Graciela.

123
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,885
We were his family once,
but he forgot all about us.

124
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:05,302
(soft music)

125
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,847
- Let me get this straight.

126
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,180
This is Antonio and Frankie.

127
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,407
- No, no.

128
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,287
Frankie, Antonio.

129
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,370
(speaking in a foreign language)

130
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,523
Oh, speaking Spanish.

131
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,356
That's good.

132
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,756
- She picked it up in the orchards.

133
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:28,197
We used to work with a lot of Mexicans.

134
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,871
- Well, we know you didn't teach her.

135
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,942
- He speaks the worst Spanish.

136
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:34,192
- [Nora] I bet.

137
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,226
- It used to make my ears hurt.

138
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:39,768
- Oh well (speaks in foreign language).

139
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:42,392
- Well, at least you've given
the world a lovely daughter.

140
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:44,366
I don't know how.

141
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:48,616
- Well, I haven't quite
given her to the world yet.

142
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:51,667
- Do you always eat out here?

143
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,693
- Oh yes, it's so beautiful.

144
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,635
God painted all this.

145
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:57,317
Your father loved it out here.

146
00:09:57,317 --> 00:10:01,272
This is where he used to do his writing.

147
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,033
- What writing?

148
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,354
- Oh, he was going to be a writer.

149
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,354
- Hemingway.

150
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:08,360
- Yeah.

151
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,891
Yeah, Hemingway.

152
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,666
- That's why he used to fish,

153
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,221
so he can write about
fishing like Hemingway.

154
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,221
The old man and the sea.

155
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,436
- [Nora] I didn't know
you wanted to be a writer.

156
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,971
- I was just scribbling things, Nora.

157
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,185
- There's so much we could
tell you about your father.

158
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,018
- I bet.

159
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,435
(soft music)

160
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,175
- Life's been good, huh?

161
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,425
- Growth I see.

162
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:40,942
And you, Shep?

163
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:42,097
- Fine, fine.

164
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:43,514
Things are great.

165
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,436
So how's the fishing anyway?

166
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,212
- Right now we're catching yellow tail.

167
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:52,122
We have two clients staying
with us from Canada.

168
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,573
We're going out tomorrow.

169
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,817
You can join us if you like.

170
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,180
- Oh no, thanks, Cheo.

171
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,453
Actually, I'm down here
looking for Scully.

172
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,286
- Scully?

173
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,999
He's not here anymore.

174
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,975
- You're kidding?

175
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,225
- Nah, he left.

176
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,706
Maybe a year ago.

177
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,539
- No, no.

178
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,208
I just saw him a couple of
months ago up in Oregon.

179
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,729
He said he's working charters

180
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,765
for some big resort down here.

181
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,045
Place called (speaks in
foreign language) or something.

182
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:26,878
It's a new resort.

183
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:27,711
They just built it.

184
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:28,545
Big fancy place.

185
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:31,824
- Yeah (speaks in foreign language).

186
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,540
But that's not in Laredo.

187
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,528
It's far.

188
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,528
It's all the way to the end of Baja.

189
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,954
- So I guess Scully moved
the boat down there.

190
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:43,557
- Nah.

191
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,011
The boat is here.

192
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,511
- I didn't see it.

193
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,362
- That's because it's a submarine.

194
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:53,800
He put the anchor in the wrong place.

195
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,062
Along came a big chubasco, big winds,

196
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:59,479
big rains, sank like a stone.

197
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:03,561
Scully.

198
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:09,510
You're not thinking of
working with him again?

199
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,343
Are you?

200
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:12,741
Aw.

201
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:17,030
(gentle music)

202
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,015
- So where do you go to school, Nora?

203
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,884
- Oh, here, there, everywhere.

204
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:27,192
- Well, I suppose it's good
to see so many new places.

205
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,084
You know I was born in this house

206
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:32,420
and when I was growing up,
this garden always smelled

207
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,087
just as it does now.

208
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,459
- Like jasmine?

209
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,777
- Jasmine, si.

210
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,297
You know your plants.

211
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,935
- Well, we worked in a big
nursery once up in Idaho.

212
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:45,985
There was a blind lady
there named Sister Marsha.

213
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,518
She showed me how to tell the
plants by their fragrance.

214
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,963
- I wonder if I could do that.

215
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:51,796
- Okay.

216
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,310
Cover your eyes.

217
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,310
- All right.

218
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,348
(gentle music)

219
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,638
That's easy.

220
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:03,868
(speaking in foreign language)

221
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:04,868
I was right.

222
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,746
You know, my grandmother planted this tree

223
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:14,012
and my mother planted the jasmine

224
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:19,012
and all the cactus's were planted
by my crazy aunt Othencia.

225
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:24,406
You must've planted lots of things, Nora.

226
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,959
- [Shep] Hey, kid.

227
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,886
We gotta hit the road.

228
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:30,502
- Yeah, but we never
stick around long enough

229
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:31,836
to see anything grow.

230
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:33,582
- Ah, Shep.

231
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,697
- [Nora] Why do we have to go now?

232
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,269
- You know, time is money.

233
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:39,465
- Why don't you let her
stay with us for awhile?

234
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:41,922
Until you get settled.

235
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,520
I could use the female company.

236
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,353
- Could I?

237
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,535
(soft music)

238
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,264
Now there's two cans
of stew under the spare

239
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,618
and we still got some
milk left in the floor

240
00:13:54,618 --> 00:13:56,493
that needs to be drunk.

241
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:58,418
Oh, I found your shades.

242
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,682
Put them in the glove compartment.

243
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:02,601
Some bucks in there, too.

244
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:06,370
You'll remember to put it all in, right?

245
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,036
- Scout's honor.

246
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:10,246
- [Nora] And don't drive too late, okay?

247
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,856
- I wouldn't think of it.

248
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,918
- [Nora] Good luck.

249
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:15,751
- Hey.

250
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,289
It's in the bag.

251
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,231
Wouldn't mind spending
a little bit of time

252
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,766
on a big fancy resort with you.

253
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,564
With a little golf, little test.

254
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:22,397
Huh?

255
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,116
You're gonna be okay then, right?

256
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,214
Being on your own?

257
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,407
(speaking in foreign language)

258
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,990
(gentle music)

259
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,753
- There's a shower back there

260
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:11,403
and we have plenty of hot water.

261
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,332
Fishermen love their showers.

262
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:14,165
Thank God.

263
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:19,441
So fresh towels and I thought
you might like a nightgown.

264
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:22,367
It's my niece Bertha's
who's just about your size.

265
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,598
- Thank you and thanks for having me.

266
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:30,320
- No (speaks in foreign language).

267
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,903
(gentle music)

268
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,888
(soft music)

269
00:16:58,236 --> 00:16:59,389
- I'm sorry.

270
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,437
Do you think it'll come out?

271
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,002
- Oh don't worry, mija.

272
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:03,636
It will all come out.

273
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,386
It was only a little.

274
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:09,248
So, is this your first time?

275
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:14,038
Well, it won't be your last.

276
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:15,571
You are a senorita now.

277
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,859
- I don't think I wanna be a senorita.

278
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,556
- Oh, of course you do.

279
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:22,283
It's wonderful to be a senorita.

280
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:23,414
But I don't suppose your father

281
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:26,510
has ever spoken to you about.

282
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,010
No, they never do.

283
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,343
Oh, what do men know anyway?

284
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:36,343
- I know about the facts of
life if that's what you mean.

285
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:38,994
- There are so many things.

286
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:45,641

- Hey.

311
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:19,705
You there, can I help you?

312
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:21,462
Shep.

313
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,018
Shep, is that you?

314
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,505
Hey, man.

315
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,614
- Take one more step, Scully,

316
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:33,022
and I will knock you on your butt.

317
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,439
- Whoa, glad to see you, too.

318
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,791
- What is this, some kind of joke?

319
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,041
I come 3000 miles for this?

320
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,123
Where's the hotel, Scully?

321
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:44,956
- [Scully] They're building it.

322
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:45,789
They are.

323
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:46,631
- Where's the golf course?

324
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:47,464
Where's the swimming pools?

325
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:49,303
Where's the jacuzzis and the whirlpools?

326
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,293
And the restaurants?

327
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:51,621
- They're building it.

328
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:54,177
- Where's the freaking work, Scully?

329
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:55,575
- Hey man.

330
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,390
I never thought you'd come all the way

331
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,307
down here for the work.

332
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,913
- Stupid.

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,941
Stupid.

334
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:05,951
Stupid.

335
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:06,960
Stupid.

336
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,293
- No, you're the stupid one.

337
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:17,152
- Who do you think I'm talking about?

338
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,569
(soft music)

339
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:57,188
- I knew you wouldn't turn
down a little ear bud.

340
00:21:57,188 --> 00:22:01,247
I'd offer you a cold
pacifico, but I'm fresh out.

341
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:04,118
Of course, get the hotel built,

342
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:06,629
there'll be a big old bar.

343
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,565
Plenty of imported beer I suppose.

344
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:11,456
- Shut up, Scully.

345
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,033
- They'll get it done someday.

346
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:19,033
After all they finished the
halls of Montezuma, didn't they?

347
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,727
- What are you doing down here, Scully?

348
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:29,144
- Well, 'til the marina gets
built, I'm the watchman.

349
00:22:30,293 --> 00:22:33,106
Got a nice little house
over there by the hotel,

350
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:36,439
which you're welcome to share of course.

351
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,675
So how's the kid?

352
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,944
- [Shep] She's fine.

353
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,257
- Bet she's getting big, huh?

354
00:22:45,257 --> 00:22:49,964
Must be getting harder tote
her around the way you do.

355
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:51,831
- Steady gig might've helped.

356
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:56,042
- Look, I never thought
you'd take me at my word.

357
00:22:56,042 --> 00:23:00,633
Hell you never listen to
anything I ever told you before.

358
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:03,050
I mean, why listen to me now?

359
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:06,469
- Maybe I needed to.

360
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,302
You know.

361
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,470
There was a time when it all made sense.

362
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,626
You took a look around at people.

363
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,491
What they did to get ahead.

364
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:19,509
Get by.

365
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:20,440
You said forget it, right?

366
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,857
Forget that game.

367
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,619
And the years fly by and you're 40.

368
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:29,025
Geez.

369
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,358
45 without a pot to piss in.

370
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:39,248
I guess we showed 'em,
didn't we Scully, huh?

371
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:41,329
We beat the game.

372
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:43,746
- Well, I ain't doing so bad.

373
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:52,995
- Jesus.

374
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:55,412
(soft music)

375
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:04,430
- [Graciela] I'm sorry if it hurts.

376
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,263
- It's okay.

377
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:08,100
(soft music)

378
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,959
- These were mine when I was a senorita.

379
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,876
Black pearls from Baja.

380
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,613
You know you have to leave
them in for at least a month.

381
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,210
- But we'll be gone by then.

382
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,402
- Oh no, they're for you.

383
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:23,824
I want you to have them.

384
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:26,407
(bell ringing)

385
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:31,609
- Hi.

386
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:36,939
(speaking in foreign language)

387
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,417
- Maya.

388
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,250
Alejandra.

389
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,458
Olivia, Ariel, Giovanni.

390
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,144
Jasmine Mala Catalina.

391
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:48,468
- Hi.

392
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:52,385
(speaking in foreign language)

393
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:06,639
- Nora.

394
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,671
- Nora.

395
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:11,143
(speaking in foreign language)

396
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,560
(soft music)

397
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:17,432
- [Nora] When we were in the plaza,

398
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,768
you told everyone that
you were my madrina.

399
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:24,995
- (speaks in foreign language)
That means godmother.

400
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:27,398
This is such a small place.

401
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:30,665
People like to know how
other people are connected.

402
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:32,706
It makes it easier for them.

403
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:36,175
So, I told them a little white lie.

404
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,620
Hope you don't mind.

405
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,148
- I'd like to have you for a godmother.

406
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:44,065
(speaking in foreign language)

407
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:55,768
- [Graciela] So, where
is your mother, Nora?

408
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:57,245
- She died.

409
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,849
I was four years old when it happened.

410
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,425
We were camped up by
rogue river in Oregon,

411
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:05,327
planting trees like we
always do in summer.

412
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:09,968
My mama loved the rogue, but
she hated planting trees.

413
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:14,141
On her knees all day digging in the dirt.

414
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,641
One day she was hot and tired,

415
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:20,204
so she just took off all her clothes

416
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,204
and jumped in the river.

417
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:25,922
They found her the next morning

418
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:30,922
tangled in the branches of a
tree like she was caught in it.

419
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:35,713
(soft music)

420
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,889
- God must have some wonderful
things in store for you, Nora

421
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:45,460
to take away from you so much so young.

422
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,877
(soft music)

423
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,635
(kids chattering)

424
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:50,761
- [Nora] Hey, how'd it go?

425
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:52,927
- Well.

426
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:55,760
- You didn't get the job, did you?

427
00:27:58,017 --> 00:27:59,068
- There'll be others.

428
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:00,881
Let's just pack up, okay?

429
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:01,801
- Right now?

430
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,206
- [Shep] Yes, now.

431
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:06,039
(kids chattering)

432
00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:10,561
- But where are we going?

433
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,052
- We're going back.

434
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:13,521
- [Nora] Why so soon?

435
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:15,000
- Because we got places to go.

436
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,436
We got things to do.

437
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,691
That's why.

438
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:20,524
(kids chattering)

439
00:28:26,562 --> 00:28:28,672
- Why the hurry, Shep?

440
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:31,089
Why not stay here for awhile?

441
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,201
- And do what, Gracie?

442
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:35,916
Live off you guys?

443
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,624
You know I can't do that.

444
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:42,209
- If you want to work,
we have plenty of work.

445
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:45,252
You can help Cheo fix the motors.

446
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:46,502
We can pay you.

447
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:50,466
- Thank you, Gracie.

448
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:52,009
I mean it.

449
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,342
You don't need two extra mouths to feed.

450
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:08,885
You're gonna knock the wheels off someday.

451
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:09,718
- Good.

452
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:18,486
- Maybe next time I'll be
back as a paying customer.

453
00:29:18,486 --> 00:29:20,643
You know, fat cigars.

454
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,176
Fat wallet.

455
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:27,176
- How will I know it's you
(speaks in foreign language)?

456
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:30,555
- Something just for you for my senorita.

457
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:31,555
- Thank you.

458
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:37,581
I'll miss you, Gracie.

459
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:39,748
- I'll miss you too, mija.

460
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:44,843
And you (speaks in foreign
language), take care of yourself.

461
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,587
- You too, old girl.

462
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,338
- Take care of my Nora.

463
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,068
You know she has a godmother now,

464
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:53,743
so you better or I'll put a spell on you.

465
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:55,993
- I think you already have.

466
00:29:57,174 --> 00:30:01,507
- Bye (speaks in foreign language).

467
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,351
(gentle music)

468
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:10,671
- Hey, you got your ears pierced.

469
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,157
Those earrings look nice, Nora.

470
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:18,156
- Why couldn't we just stay in Laredo?

471
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:19,599
- And do what?

472
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,092
Shovel dung in some donkey town?

473
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:24,165
- It's not a donkey town.

474
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:25,841
It's a pretty town.

475
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,605
And the people there are good people.

476
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:28,946
They're real people.

477
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:31,446
When they smile, they mean it.

478
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:34,239
- I'm glad you like the place.

479
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,072
I mean it.

480
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:36,474
Really.

481
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:39,010
But Nora, sometimes in life
when things don't pan out,

482
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,693
you just gotta move on.

483
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:45,629
- Things never pan out and
we're always moving on.

484
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:46,560
- Look I couldn't say anything before

485
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,158
in front of Gracie and Cheo,

486
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:51,145
but I think we might have us a little gig.

487
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:54,093
Meeting some people up the coast.

488
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,926
- What kind of people?

489
00:31:58,153 --> 00:31:59,980
- [Shep] Just some people Scully knows.

490
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,813
- Scully?

491
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:01,980
- Yes, Scully.

492
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:04,231
I think he owes us one.

493
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:05,064
Don't you?

494
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,083
It's a business connection.

495
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:12,969
Don't worry.

496
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:13,987
It's for real this time.

497
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:14,906
- How do you know?

498
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,323
- Because I know.

499
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:19,134
Look, I can't talk about it anymore.

500
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:20,967
I don't wanna jinx it.

501
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,974
- This sounds very, very stupid.

502
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:30,263
You know, sometimes I wish I had a home,

503
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:32,263
so I could be a runaway.

504
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,807
- It's gonna be a long drive.

505
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,657
(soft music)

506
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,955
You and the Mexicans really
seemed to hit it off.

507
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:34,372
(soft music)

508
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:39,740
You make friends easy
down here, don't you?

509
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,314
- Down here they treat me like a person.

510
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:45,064
Up there, I'm just trailer trash.

511
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,718
(soft music)

512
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:03,905
(dogs barking)

513
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,698
- [Shep] Let me get this straight.

514
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:21,531
This is.

515
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:27,305
(speaking in foreign language)

516
00:34:45,977 --> 00:34:47,490
- [Nora Voiceover] Senorita.

517
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,907
How did she know?

518
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:52,150
- [Shep] Nora.

519
00:34:56,204 --> 00:34:57,836
All set.

520
00:34:57,836 --> 00:34:59,271
- What's going on?

521
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,369
- Just making a delivery is all.

522
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:02,647
- [Nora] What kind of delivery?

523
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:03,833
- Just picking up a couple of kids.

524
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,666
Give them a ride.

525
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:05,499
That's all.

526
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:06,332
- That's all?

527
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,659
- Yeah, that's all.

528
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:08,825
500 bucks a head.

529
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:10,885
- Geez, why don't they take the bus?

530
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:14,665
- Bus doesn't go across the border, Nora.

531
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:15,498
Don't worry.

532
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,638
Scully does it all the time.

533
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:18,721
- Oh, that makes it cool.

534
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:31,743
(dog barking)

535
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:36,852
- Hey.

536
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:37,685
(speaking in foreign language)

537
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:38,842
Hey.

538
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:40,384
Jorge.

539
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:41,227
- Jose, Jose.

540
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,060
- [Shep] Jose.

541
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,220
- Jose (speaks in foreign language).

542
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,107
- I was close.

543
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:44,940
And.

544
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:47,306
- Junior.

545
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,139
- Junior.

546
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,139
How can I forget Junior?

547
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:53,875
(speaks in foreign language) Nora.

548
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,960
(speaking in foreign language)

549
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,426
Well, hop in the back.

550
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:00,071
- Are they gonna have enough room?

551
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:00,904
- Well yeah.

552
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:03,412
In Mexico, the bus is never full.

553
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,245
Go.

554
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,493
Let's go.

555
00:36:23,861 --> 00:36:27,851
- [Nora] They must've saved
their whole lives for this trip.

556
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,957
(singing in foreign language)

557
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:32,443
- [Shep] Well it's a good investment.

558
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:34,265
Jose sings, you know.

559
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:38,098
(singing in foreign language)

560
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:05,653
Need to make some room for our passengers.

561
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:07,262
- In the trunk?

562
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:08,262
- Okay boys.

563
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:13,919
- How long they gonna be in there?

564
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:15,711
(gentle music)

565
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:16,544
- Junior.

566
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:20,542
The border's just up the road, Nora.

567
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:22,504
- They'll need water.

568
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:23,458
- Oh, good idea.

569
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,041
(gentle music)

570
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,472
Okay.

571
00:37:28,472 --> 00:37:29,450
Jose.

572
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,033
(gentle music)

573
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:36,105
Hey, here's a pillow, Jose.

574
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:36,938
Pillow?

575
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,188
- Yes, gracias.

576
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,606
Gracias.

577
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:41,439
- Water.

578
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:46,858
Won't be long now, boys.

579
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:49,477
Land of opportunity here we come.

580
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,060
(gentle music)

581
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,479
- [Nora] Promise me if we get caught,

582
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:58,543
you'll give them back their money.

583
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,415
- [Shep] Nora, we're not gonna get caught.

584
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:01,248
- [Nora] But if we do.

585
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:03,152
- [Shep] Yes, I promise I'll
give them back their money,

586
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:05,224
but we're not gonna get caught.

587
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:07,122
You gotta learn to think positive.

588
00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:08,957
(gentle music)

589
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:09,790
Oh no.

590
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,017
Oh man.

591
00:38:15,236 --> 00:38:17,997
- Maybe we should let
them out of the trunk.

592
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:18,830
- In a minute.

593
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,663
We gotta cool the engine down.

594
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,580
Keep revving the motor.

595
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Little more.

596
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:27,056
Keep revving the motor.

597
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,589
Little more.

598
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,313
Good, good, good.

599
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:33,313
Let me know when the light goes out.

600
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:36,625
The light still on?

601
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,458
- Yes.

602
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,146
- Must be leaking water somewhere.

603
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:41,479
Kill the engine.

604
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:55,048
- Shep.

605
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:04,244
We got company.

606
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:09,301
- Oh hell.

607
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,813
Now we're in it.

608
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,507
(speaking in foreign language)

609
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:37,475
But it's leaking.

610
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,308
Leaking out.

611
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:42,272
(speaking in foreign language)

612
00:39:42,272 --> 00:39:44,689
(soft music)

613
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:08,183
(speaking in foreign language)

614
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:09,858
- He says we need a tow truck.

615
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:12,004
- Yeah, I heard him, Nora.

616
00:40:12,004 --> 00:40:15,921
(speaking in foreign language)

617
00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:30,413
(soft music)

618
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:03,319
- He said they'll be back in five minutes.

619
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,765
- Open the trunk, Nora.

620
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:25,765
Let 'em out.

621
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,330
(gentle music)

622
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,929
(speaking in foreign language)

623
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,346
(soft music)

624
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,975
- Hey, wake up.

625
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:55,225
Please wake up.

626
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:58,418
Shep.

627
00:41:58,418 --> 00:42:00,835
(soft music)

628
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:04,292
They won't wake up.

629
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:06,709
(soft music)

630
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:13,468
- Oh Jesus.

631
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,543
- What happened?

632
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:20,069
- Nora, go get your pack and
throw in a bottle of water.

633
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:22,027
- What about them?

634
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:23,777
- They're dead, Nora.

635
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:27,364
- We can't just leave 'em.

636
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:28,362
- Do it now.

637
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:30,779
(soft music)

638
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:57,349
Nora.

639
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,766
(soft music)

640
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:08,622
(gentle music)

641
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,363
Jesus Christ.

642
00:43:45,215 --> 00:43:46,882
How did this happen?

643
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:49,564
Must've been that crack
in the engine blocked.

644
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:50,794
The fumes probably seeped out

645
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,127
and carried back into the trunk somehow.

646
00:43:59,362 --> 00:44:02,127
Sun's going down there so that way's east.

647
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:03,460
Towards the sea.

648
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,127
If we could just make it to
the sea, we'll be all right.

649
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:09,437
Find a fisherman.

650
00:44:09,437 --> 00:44:11,200
Pay him to take us down the coast.

651
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,502
Okay, that'll work.

652
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:15,434
We'll be all right.

653
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:17,989
- How can you keep saying that?

654
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,900
Two people are dead and we killed them,

655
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,181
so we're not all right.

656
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:24,848
- Nora, we did not kill anybody.

657
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:28,340
It was an accident.

658
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,814
How was I supposed to
know there was a crack

659
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:32,747
in the engine block spewing
fumes all over the place?

660
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:34,554
- They trusted us.

661
00:44:34,554 --> 00:44:35,815
- Nora.

662
00:44:35,815 --> 00:44:37,772
There's nothing we can do about it.

663
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:38,960
Nothing.

664
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,580
We just gotta keep going.

665
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,247
We gotta keep going.

666
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:47,817
- Two good people never
to see their homes.

667
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:48,650
Their families.

668
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,233
Nothing ever again.

669
00:44:51,077 --> 00:44:52,160
- [Shep] Hey.

670
00:44:55,088 --> 00:44:56,505
- Leave me alone.

671
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:12,542
(singing in foreign language)

672
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:48,214
- [Nora] The sky turned red that night

673
00:45:48,214 --> 00:45:50,297
and so did the mountains.

674
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:52,935
All red.

675
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:53,768
Blood red.

676
00:46:21,703 --> 00:46:24,203
(dog barking)

677
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,009
- This is stealing, you know.

678
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:02,493
- You wanna freeze tonight?

679
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:04,358
- You gotta leave them something.

680
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:05,782
- Leave them what?

681
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:06,615
- Money.

682
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:08,948
It's all blood money anyway.

683
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:23,330
(soft music)

684
00:48:49,203 --> 00:48:52,370
How do you know which way we're going?

685
00:48:55,884 --> 00:49:00,051
- The hour hand to the sun
makes 12 o'clock south.

686
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:05,388
That's south and that's east to the sea.

687
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:12,146
(soft music)

688
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:15,849
- [Nora] If we didn't do anything wrong,

689
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:18,035
why are we running away?

690
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:22,131
- [Shep] The police
don't know that, do they?

691
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:24,176
- [Nora] We can just tell them the truth.

692
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:25,924
- Oh yeah, right.

693
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:28,398
Doesn't work that way, Nora.

694
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:29,874
Down here money talks.

695
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:31,264
And you know where that
leaves us, don't you?

696
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:32,539
Speechless.

697
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:34,206
It's a Mexican jail.

698
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,403
Damn loafers.

699
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,716
I don't know why I started wearing 'em.

700
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:43,994
- 'Cause they were cheap.

701
00:50:43,994 --> 00:50:45,379
You get 'em at the Goodwill.

702
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:47,462
- I know where I got 'em.

703
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:51,775
- Geez, Shep.

704
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:58,529
- At least we know it isn't frostbite.

705
00:50:58,529 --> 00:51:00,194
It looks worse than it feels.

706
00:51:00,194 --> 00:51:02,656
- [Nora] Maybe we should
slow down a little.

707
00:51:02,656 --> 00:51:04,789
- I like to make those
hills there by day's end.

708
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:08,456
- [Nora] You gotta get
off your feet awhile.

709
00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:15,170
(gentle music)

710
00:52:02,595 --> 00:52:03,428
- Not bad.

711
00:52:04,696 --> 00:52:08,282
Put a nice little bounce in your step.

712
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:10,274
So how long you been using these things?

713
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:11,274
- Just started.

714
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:12,107
- I see.

715
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:13,839
I see.

716
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,436
So it's still going on?

717
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:16,972
- No.

718
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:19,166
- Oh, well that's good.

719
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,854
I suppose that's good.

720
00:52:20,854 --> 00:52:21,941
So how'd it go?

721
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:23,628
- I don't know.

722
00:52:23,628 --> 00:52:24,898
All right, I guess.

723
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:26,480
- Good.

724
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,313
Great.

725
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,217
- We don't have to talk about it.

726
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:32,792
- What do you mean?

727
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:35,945
- I mean, we don't have to talk about it.

728
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:36,945
- All right.

729
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:48,459
So, where'd you get
these shoe pads anyway?

730
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:51,856
- Graciela.

731
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:52,689
- Oh.

732
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:55,930
So I guess she told you
what you needed to know.

733
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,793
Gave you instructions and all.

734
00:52:57,793 --> 00:52:59,696
- It's not that complicated.

735
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:01,461
- Well, that's good.

736
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:05,632
I don't know why I always
had the feeling that it was.

737
00:53:05,632 --> 00:53:09,645
Guess you'll be going through
all kinds of changes now huh?

738
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,062
Physical changes.

739
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:14,144
All kinds of changes.

740
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,240
I wish I knew more.

741
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,990
- I'll figure it out.

742
00:53:22,894 --> 00:53:25,182
- I do know one thing.

743
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:27,793
It's a good thing we're not in New Guinea.

744
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:29,291
- Why?

745
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,933
- Well then I'd have to lock
you up in a hut every month

746
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:33,256
to ward off the evil
spirits and all, you know,

747
00:53:33,256 --> 00:53:34,461
since we don't even have a hut.

748
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,294
- Oh you.

749
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:42,919
(gentle music)

750
00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:40,891
I haven't had to pee in a long time.

751
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,902
- Just a little dehydrated.

752
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:45,235
See those trees?

753
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,167
Where there's trees, there's water.

754
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:51,263
- Is it real?

755
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:53,680
(soft music)

756
00:54:55,479 --> 00:54:59,146
- Relatively speaking,
none of this is real.

757
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:06,278
(soft music)

758
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:08,015
Hey, come on, kid.

759
00:55:08,015 --> 00:55:08,848
Come on.

760
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:10,181
Let me help you.

761
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:11,978
- You go on.

762
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:14,645
I'll just wait here for the bus.

763
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,464
(soft music)

764
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:19,297
- Okay.

765
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,057
Here comes the bus.

766
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:24,474
(soft music)

767
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:10,824
(gentle music)

768
00:57:01,947 --> 00:57:05,261
Everything comes from fire, Nora.

769
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:06,178
Everything.

770
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:08,801
Iron age.

771
00:57:09,914 --> 00:57:10,831
Bronze age.

772
00:57:12,443 --> 00:57:15,276
Civilization itself all from fire.

773
00:57:17,472 --> 00:57:19,941
Industrial revolution.

774
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:21,191
The atomic age.

775
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:23,709
From fire.

776
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:26,903
Global warming.

777
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:29,436
Greenhouse effect.

778
00:57:30,586 --> 00:57:32,336
The end of the earth.

779
00:57:35,262 --> 00:57:36,689
All from fire.

780
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:39,106
(soft music)

781
00:57:40,472 --> 00:57:42,555
- Why'd you stop writing?

782
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:46,535
- I wasn't very good at it.

783
00:57:46,535 --> 00:57:49,702
- I think you're real good with words.

784
00:57:52,593 --> 00:57:53,763
- Well, there's more to writing

785
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:56,513
than being good with words, Nora.

786
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:02,843
It's more about using words
to share some sort of insight.

787
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:07,969
And there was a time there where I guess.

788
00:58:10,452 --> 00:58:13,874
I guess I didn't feel like
I had much insight to offer.

789
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:16,457
- You just gave up, didn't you?

790
00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:19,267
- Oh hell, it was inside work anyway.

791
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:22,470
You know I can't handle inside work.

792
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,699
- Why didn't you write for yourself?

793
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:28,616
You know, short stories
or poetry or something.

794
00:58:29,524 --> 00:58:32,227
- Your mother was the poet.

795
00:58:32,227 --> 00:58:33,839
- Really?

796
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,839
Do you have anything that she wrote?

797
00:58:39,569 --> 00:58:40,402
- No.

798
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:48,609
- [Nora] You hardly ever
talk about her, you know.

799
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,199
- Well she's been gone awhile now.

800
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,451
- So you don't even think about her?

801
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:54,118
- I think about her.

802
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,291
I think about her a lot.

803
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:04,880
I see a lot of her in you, you know.

804
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,713
She had beautiful eyes like yours.

805
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:13,378
And she could be pretty bullheaded.

806
00:59:15,563 --> 00:59:16,396
Like you.

807
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:22,874
But she never quite had
your resilience, you know.

808
00:59:22,874 --> 00:59:23,707
She.

809
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,916
She just let things get to her.

810
00:59:33,138 --> 00:59:36,638
- Cousin Becky said she did it on purpose.

811
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:39,355
- Did what?

812
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:42,355
- [Nora] Drowned herself on purpose.

813
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:48,411
- Jesus, Nora.

814
00:59:48,411 --> 00:59:50,252
You don't believe that, do you?

815
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:51,252
- Sometimes.

816
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:55,808
Becky said she was tired of dirt.

817
00:59:55,808 --> 00:59:59,975
Tired of trees and teepees
and tents and trailers.

818
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:06,201
- How long you been carrying that around?

819
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:07,201
- Long time.

820
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:10,321
So it's not true?

821
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:14,508
- Of course it isn't true.

822
01:00:17,677 --> 01:00:20,760
Your mother loved you too much, Nora.

823
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,152
Besides.

824
01:00:27,797 --> 01:00:29,214
She'd never just.

825
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,249
Just leave us like that.

826
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:38,666
(soft music)

827
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,077
(coyote howling)

828
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,375
Old friends.

829
01:01:15,597 --> 01:01:17,683
- They've been following us.

830
01:01:17,683 --> 01:01:19,283
- Yeah, that's 'cause they know

831
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:22,423
who's gonna lead 'em to the good times.

832
01:01:22,423 --> 01:01:23,854
- Shep.

833
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:26,521
Sorry I been ragging you lately.

834
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:29,150
- It's all right.

835
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,135
I deserved it.

836
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:31,968
- I know.

837
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:35,738
But I'm sorry anyway.

838
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:38,456
- You know, Nora.

839
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:40,881
I've been thinking.

840
01:01:42,144 --> 01:01:44,413
I think you should be the writer.

841
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:45,970
- Maybe I will.

842
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:49,220
I could write about all our adventures.

843
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:55,122
- As long as you don't have
to live them anymore right?

844
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:04,346
(gentle music)

845
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:54,311
Fishing camp.

846
01:04:08,031 --> 01:04:08,948
Still warm.

847
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,738
They were here this morning.

848
01:04:11,738 --> 01:04:12,571
- Think they'll be back?

849
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,419
- It's a good chance.

850
01:04:14,419 --> 01:04:17,764
They usually work out of
the same camp for weeks.

851
01:04:17,764 --> 01:04:20,649
If we're lucky, they'll be back.

852
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:21,911
- Then what?

853
01:04:21,911 --> 01:04:22,877
- Well, then we'll offer them some money.

854
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:24,537
Maybe they'll take us down the coast.

855
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:25,370
I mean, who knows?

856
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,523
Their fishing stinks,
maybe they'll take us

857
01:04:26,523 --> 01:04:28,523
all the way to the ramp.

858
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:30,953
- Then what?

859
01:04:33,254 --> 01:04:34,254
- Then what?

860
01:04:35,332 --> 01:04:36,849
Well.

861
01:04:36,849 --> 01:04:38,620
There's a lot of rich
gringo yachts down there.

862
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,620
We'll hitch a ride home.

863
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:43,988
- Where is that?

864
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:46,645
- Yeah, I know.

865
01:04:47,844 --> 01:04:51,853
Well, at least we know we
won't be sleeping in the car

866
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:54,103
since we no longer own one.

867
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:57,105
Hey, maybe we'll try something
different this time, Nora.

868
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,257
You know, we'll get a real place.

869
01:04:58,257 --> 01:04:59,624
Get an apartment or something.

870
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:00,825
- You know you hate apartments.

871
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:02,520
You'll go stir crazy.

872
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,411
- Well maybe I'll just have
to learn to meditate, won't I?

873
01:05:05,411 --> 01:05:06,949
- How we gonna pay for it?

874
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:08,371
Can't sign a lease without a job.

875
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,538
- I know that.

876
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:12,810
Maybe I'll get me a steady gig this time.

877
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,093
- [Nora] Where?

878
01:05:14,093 --> 01:05:16,020
- I don't know.

879
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,020
They're always hiring at the canary.

880
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:21,288
What?

881
01:05:21,288 --> 01:05:23,468
- [Nora] Nothing.

882
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:26,015
- Come on, spit it out.

883
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,612
- You wouldn't last a week.

884
01:05:28,612 --> 01:05:30,185
- And how do you know?

885
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:32,168
And how did you get me
started on this anyway, Nora?

886
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:33,535
Jesus.

887
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:35,665
You got me worried about things
that are 3000 miles away.

888
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:36,983
I think we got enough to
worry about right here.

889
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:37,816
Don't you?

890
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,122
- Just trying to think ahead.

891
01:05:42,122 --> 01:05:43,849
- [Shep] Yeah well,
don't think so far ahead.

892
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:45,617
- One of us has to.

893
01:05:45,617 --> 01:05:47,700
One of us has to grow up.

894
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:55,678
(seagulls squawking)

895
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:15,458
Don't look like Mexicans to me.

896
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:26,997
- Hey.

897
01:06:26,997 --> 01:06:28,058
Catch anything?

898
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:28,891
- Nope, no luck.

899
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:31,149
- What are you after, the yellowtail?

900
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:32,330
- Yeah.

901
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,247
- Heading down again tomorrow, huh?

902
01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:37,753
- Think you got our spot here.

903
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:38,586
- Oh no.

904
01:06:38,586 --> 01:06:42,172
We're camped further up the beach.

905
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:43,132
I used to work charter boats down here.

906
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:46,222
I know these waters pretty well.

907
01:06:46,222 --> 01:06:47,305
- Is that so?

908
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:05,729
- Maybe you could use a guide.

909
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:07,261
Wouldn't cost you anything.

910
01:07:07,261 --> 01:07:10,677
When the fishing's done, just
give us a ride down the coast.

911
01:07:10,677 --> 01:07:13,502
First village we get to.

912
01:07:13,502 --> 01:07:15,429
- What about your girl there?

913
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:16,747
- Oh, she'd come along.

914
01:07:16,747 --> 01:07:18,931
She's a good hand.

915
01:07:18,931 --> 01:07:20,809
Beat your lines, clean your catch.

916
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:22,142
She does it all.

917
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,283
- I bet.

918
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,550
We're just gonna kick it around a bit.

919
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,967
Where you camped?

920
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:39,808
- Other side of the cove.

921
01:07:40,784 --> 01:07:41,617
- How far?

922
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:45,117
- It's a hike.

923
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:45,950
I'll tell you what.

924
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:46,783
We'll just swing by in the morning.

925
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:47,616
If you want us, that's fine.

926
01:07:47,616 --> 01:07:48,449
If not.

927
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:51,694
That's fine, too.

928
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:55,668
- Like I said, we're kicking around.

929
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:59,647
(soft music)

930
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,551
(dramatic music)

931
01:08:40,786 --> 01:08:41,619
- Yup.

932
01:08:43,021 --> 01:08:44,938
Other side of the cove.

933
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:47,589
- We shouldn't have let them go.

934
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:50,006
(soft music)

935
01:09:05,912 --> 01:09:10,067
- We are not getting in a
boat with those lizards.

936
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:13,038
- I don't think they're
even gonna ask us anyway.

937
01:09:13,038 --> 01:09:15,317
I doubt they're even fishing.

938
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,281
- So what are they doing here?

939
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:19,482
- I don't know.

940
01:09:19,482 --> 01:09:21,906
Waiting for a drop off.

941
01:09:21,906 --> 01:09:23,406
Little dope maybe.

942
01:09:24,412 --> 01:09:28,278
I'm sure they rather we weren't even here.

943
01:09:28,278 --> 01:09:30,090
- [Nora] Geez, Shep.

944
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:33,090
(suspenseful music)

945
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:13,854
- Come on, kid, let's go.

946
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:14,745
- [Nora] Oh no.

947
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:16,175
Shep, this is crazy.

948
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:17,305
- Nora, come on.

949
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:18,630
- What if they come back?

950
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,047
- Will you quit thinking
about peace for Christ sake?

951
01:11:21,047 --> 01:11:22,880
- [Nora] Crazy, crazy.

952
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:25,460
- It's a crazy world.

953
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,210
(dramatic music)

954
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:37,430
- Checked the gas?

955
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,177
- Yes, I checked the gas.

956
01:11:39,177 --> 01:11:42,499
(dramatic music)

957
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:43,462
- Don't forget the choke.

958
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:44,462
- Thank you.

959
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,251
- Don't flood it.

960
01:11:47,251 --> 01:11:49,633
(dramatic music)

961
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:50,716
It's flooded.

962
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,393
- Dammit.

963
01:11:52,393 --> 01:11:55,388
(dramatic music)

964
01:11:55,388 --> 01:11:56,921
Okay, now I'm just gonna
untie the bow line.

965
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:57,925
Give it a push.

966
01:11:57,925 --> 01:11:59,749
Want you to go out with the tide, okay.

967
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:02,499
(dramatic music)

968
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:08,282
- They're coming.

969
01:12:09,851 --> 01:12:12,851
(suspenseful music)

970
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:27,696
(coyote growling)

971
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:35,572
(coyote howling)

972
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:53,450
(coyote growling)

973
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:54,919
- They're close.

974
01:13:54,919 --> 01:13:57,752
(coyote growling)

975
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:04,016
(coyote howling)

976
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:13,744
- See 'em?

977
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:17,885
- Where?

978
01:14:17,885 --> 01:14:20,885
(suspenseful music)

979
01:14:35,428 --> 01:14:38,178
(coyote howling)

980
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:42,105
- They must want something.

981
01:14:42,105 --> 01:14:44,938
(coyote growling)

982
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:49,183
They definitely want something.

983
01:14:49,183 --> 01:14:54,183
(soft music)
(coyote howling)

984
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,859
(bright music)

985
01:15:28,736 --> 01:15:31,307
- Took the boat about
50 miles north of here

986
01:15:31,307 --> 01:15:33,235
and we hitched the rest of the way.

987
01:15:33,235 --> 01:15:35,239
Any big yachts in port?

988
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,306
- Just one that arrived a few days ago.

989
01:15:37,306 --> 01:15:39,103
Gringos from San Francisco or San Diego.

990
01:15:39,103 --> 01:15:40,891
Somewhere up north.

991
01:15:40,891 --> 01:15:43,308
(soft music)

992
01:16:02,484 --> 01:16:03,317
- I know.

993
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:07,615
What the hell was I thinking?

994
01:16:07,615 --> 01:16:10,296
- She's not a kid anymore, Shep.

995
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:15,296
A girl at that age needs
(speaks in foreign language).

996
01:16:16,182 --> 01:16:20,824
That business with those poor
(speaks in foreign language).

997
01:16:20,824 --> 01:16:22,988
Next time you get a crazy idea,

998
01:16:22,988 --> 01:16:27,988
just go off by yourself and
do it and leave Nora with us

999
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:31,141
because I'm her godmother, you know.

1000
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:37,815
- Well hell, maybe you'd
like to be my godmother, too.

1001
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:39,565
Sure I could use one.

1002
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:45,487
Gracie, even if we make it back north,

1003
01:16:45,487 --> 01:16:49,154
I don't know what's
there for me or for her.

1004
01:16:50,384 --> 01:16:52,217
(soft music)

1005
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:53,884
Especially for Nora.

1006
01:16:55,459 --> 01:16:57,744
- She could stay here in Laredo.

1007
01:16:57,744 --> 01:17:00,728
(soft music)

1008
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:02,061
You both should.

1009
01:17:04,573 --> 01:17:08,104
That way I could keep my eye on you.

1010
01:17:08,104 --> 01:17:10,302
Keep you out of trouble.

1011
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:12,719
(soft music)

1012
01:17:26,283 --> 01:17:28,522
- [Shep] Thought you'd
be out like a light.

1013
01:17:28,522 --> 01:17:29,855
- Just thinking.

1014
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,058
- Better get some sleep, Nora.

1015
01:17:33,058 --> 01:17:35,723
- I was thinking about Jose and Junior.

1016
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:38,758
I was thinking we should've warned them.

1017
01:17:38,758 --> 01:17:41,331
Probably saw some stupid American movies.

1018
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:44,792
Thought everybody up there is rich.

1019
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,382
- All they had to do was
take one look at us, right?

1020
01:17:47,382 --> 01:17:50,557
- [Nora] And the good they left behind.

1021
01:17:50,557 --> 01:17:51,390
- Bells.

1022
01:17:52,856 --> 01:17:54,439
- What do you mean?

1023
01:17:55,495 --> 01:17:58,759
- Every town and village
in Mexico has its bells

1024
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:01,181
and they ring for you when you're born

1025
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:04,242
and when you marry and when you die.

1026
01:18:04,242 --> 01:18:06,866
They announce to the
world that you matter.

1027
01:18:06,866 --> 01:18:08,824
That you belong.

1028
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:11,241
(soft music)

1029
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:39,281
- It's gonna be like 80
people that are there.

1030
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,114
- Wow.

1031
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:41,821
Who's gonna be there?

1032
01:18:41,821 --> 01:18:43,988
- [Girl] Kids from school.

1033
01:18:48,813 --> 01:18:52,946
- Hey (speaks in foreign language).

1034
01:18:52,946 --> 01:18:54,432
(speaking in foreign language)

1035
01:18:54,432 --> 01:18:56,253
These are my friends, Yvette and Marisol.

1036
01:18:56,253 --> 01:18:57,420
- Oh.

1037
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,337
(speaking in foreign language)

1038
01:19:03,297 --> 01:19:05,201
Not bad, huh?

1039
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:07,701
- Are we gonna be here awhile?

1040
01:19:08,572 --> 01:19:10,155
- I don't know yet.

1041
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:13,670
What?

1042
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:17,320
- Well, there's gonna be a
dance at sunset in the plaza.

1043
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,222
They just invited me to go.

1044
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:21,472
- A dance, huh?

1045
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:24,251
- Like a school dance.

1046
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:26,634
- There's not gonna be
any boys there I hope.

1047
01:19:26,634 --> 01:19:28,039
- [Nora] Oh you.

1048
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:31,956
(speaking in foreign language)

1049
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:38,316
- Well that's good.

1050
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:41,492
Yeah sure, we can stick around for that.

1051
01:19:41,492 --> 01:19:42,325
- Really?

1052
01:19:44,129 --> 01:19:47,252
(seagulls squawking)

1053
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:48,085
- Yeah, yeah.

1054
01:19:48,085 --> 01:19:49,668
We'll stick around.

1055
01:19:50,926 --> 01:19:54,843
(speaking in foreign language)

1056
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:08,774
You know Cheo, out of all
the jobs I've ever had,

1057
01:20:08,774 --> 01:20:13,401
I think the only one I ever
really loved was fishing.

1058
01:20:13,401 --> 01:20:14,823
- There, you see.

1059
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:18,656
That's why you should
stay right here with us.

1060
01:20:20,602 --> 01:20:23,600
- You want this little line doubled?

1061
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,454
- Stay there.

1062
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:28,908
- Yeah, I fished 'em
all one time or another.

1063
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:32,179
I even used to take the kid
along with me sometimes,

1064
01:20:32,179 --> 01:20:35,666
even when she was just a little toddler.

1065
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:39,046
She had this little yellow slicker.

1066
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:40,316
Big floppy hat on her head.

1067
01:20:40,316 --> 01:20:41,149
God.

1068
01:20:42,058 --> 01:20:44,727
She looked liked the Morton salt girl.

1069
01:20:44,727 --> 01:20:47,425
She'd be barking orders at the crew.

1070
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,082
God, they ate it up.

1071
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:50,332
They ate it up.

1072
01:20:52,408 --> 01:20:54,075
God, they loved her.

1073
01:20:55,942 --> 01:20:57,947
You got any clippers?

1074
01:20:57,947 --> 01:20:59,569
(speaking in foreign language)

1075
01:20:59,569 --> 01:21:02,830
- You have to ask Graciela for another.

1076
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:05,111
Why don't you ask her?

1077
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,494
She wouldn't yell at you.

1078
01:21:07,494 --> 01:21:09,911
(soft music)

1079
01:21:14,718 --> 01:21:17,715
- When we used to go to
the dance in the school,

1080
01:21:17,715 --> 01:21:20,562
the teachers would watch us like hawks,

1081
01:21:20,562 --> 01:21:23,179
and if a boy touched
you in the wrong place,

1082
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:27,476
they would pull him by the
dance floor by the ear.

1083
01:21:27,476 --> 01:21:29,117
Cheo could tell you.

1084
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:30,879
They pulled his ear so many times,

1085
01:21:30,879 --> 01:21:33,135
I thought it would fall off.

1086
01:21:33,135 --> 01:21:34,122
(hand knocking)

1087
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:35,423
(speaking in foreign language)

1088
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,735
- No gentlemen allowed.

1089
01:21:36,735 --> 01:21:38,899
- I just wanna borrow some nail clippers.

1090
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:41,404
- Did Cheo send you (speaks
in foreign language)?

1091
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:43,109
He loses them all.

1092
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:45,703
- Oh, I see you're all dressed up, too.

1093
01:21:45,703 --> 01:21:46,857
- Of course.

1094
01:21:46,857 --> 01:21:48,783
I'm the chaperone.

1095
01:21:48,783 --> 01:21:50,888
It's not like in the states, you know.

1096
01:21:50,888 --> 01:21:52,941
Down here we watch out for the boys.

1097
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:57,524
They have many tricks, but
believe me, I know them all.

1098
01:21:59,078 --> 01:22:00,866
- I bet you do.

1099
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:05,449
- If he loses these, tell
him I'll pull his little ear.

1100
01:22:07,146 --> 01:22:09,563
(soft music)

1101
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:21,951
(speaking in foreign language)

1102
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,879
(soft music)

1103
01:22:39,402 --> 01:22:40,510
- They found the brochure

1104
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:45,510
of (speaks in foreign
language) in your car.

1105
01:22:46,219 --> 01:22:47,175
- And they got to Scully.

1106
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:49,006
(speaking in foreign language)

1107
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,304
- And he must've told them about us.

1108
01:22:52,304 --> 01:22:54,054
I'm sorry, my friend.

1109
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:58,521
There's a big powerboat leaving tonight.

1110
01:23:02,365 --> 01:23:04,615
I hear they're shorthanded.

1111
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:14,144
- (speaks in foreign language) Awaits you.

1112
01:23:14,144 --> 01:23:15,311
What happened?

1113
01:23:16,778 --> 01:23:20,695
(speaking in foreign language)

1114
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:41,515
- Well.

1115
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:43,015
What do you think?

1116
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:46,826
Oh I look really ridiculous, don't I?

1117
01:23:46,826 --> 01:23:47,779
- [Shep] No, no.

1118
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:48,739
- I knew it.

1119
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:49,572
- [Shep] No, you look beautiful.

1120
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:51,213
- This dress just hangs on me like a sack

1121
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:52,448
'cause there's nothing to hold it up.

1122
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,295
- [Shep] You look smashing.

1123
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:54,248
- I mean nothing.

1124
01:23:54,248 --> 01:23:55,523
- [Shep] You do.

1125
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:59,063
- You're just saying that
'cause you're my old man.

1126
01:23:59,063 --> 01:23:59,896
- Nora.

1127
01:24:02,812 --> 01:24:06,028
You look just like I
always imagined you would.

1128
01:24:06,028 --> 01:24:07,620
- These shoes are killing me.

1129
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,902
I don't know how you're
supposed to dance with them.

1130
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:13,443
Guess it doesn't matter
since I can't dance anyway.

1131
01:24:13,443 --> 01:24:14,930
- Sure you can.

1132
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,733
It's in your genes.

1133
01:24:16,733 --> 01:24:18,156
Did I ever tell you that I was once

1134
01:24:18,156 --> 01:24:20,308
a very famous flamingo dancer?

1135
01:24:20,308 --> 01:24:21,141
- [Nora] Yeah right.

1136
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:22,604
- Really.

1137
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:26,915
I was known as (speaks
in foreign language).

1138
01:24:26,915 --> 01:24:30,096
(speaking in foreign language)

1139
01:24:30,096 --> 01:24:30,929
- Pumpkin?

1140
01:24:32,766 --> 01:24:34,380
- Yeah well.

1141
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,750
Something like that.

1142
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,917
- Will you wait up for me?

1143
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:40,871
- Yeah.

1144
01:24:41,984 --> 01:24:44,067
Yeah, I'll be right here.

1145
01:24:48,991 --> 01:24:49,824
Don't worry.

1146
01:24:49,824 --> 01:24:51,074
You'll do fine.

1147
01:24:52,811 --> 01:24:55,075
Just follow the rhythm.

1148
01:24:55,075 --> 01:24:56,465
One, two, three.

1149
01:24:56,465 --> 01:24:58,023
One, two, three.

1150
01:24:58,023 --> 01:24:59,896
One, two, three.

1151
01:24:59,896 --> 01:25:00,729
- [Nora] Show me.

1152
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:02,063
Dance with me.

1153
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:04,337
- Oh Nora, I'm not exactly dressed.

1154
01:25:04,337 --> 01:25:07,055
- [Nora] You'll never be exactly dressed.

1155
01:25:07,055 --> 01:25:09,555
- No, I guess I never will be.

1156
01:25:12,603 --> 01:25:15,020
(soft music)

1157
01:25:18,677 --> 01:25:19,848
One, two, three.

1158
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,463
One, two, three.

1159
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:23,030
One, two, three.

1160
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:25,613
(gentle music)

1161
01:25:34,552 --> 01:25:37,928
We've had some times, haven't we, kid?

1162
01:25:37,928 --> 01:25:39,403
- [Nora] Yeah, we have.

1163
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:41,986
(gentle music)

1164
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:31,889
(bell ringing)
(gentle music)

1165
01:26:48,845 --> 01:26:50,597
- [Nora Voiceover] When I
heard the evening bells,

1166
01:26:50,597 --> 01:26:53,003
I remembered my father's words.

1167
01:26:53,003 --> 01:26:55,637
They announced to the world
that someone mattered.

1168
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:57,054
Someone belonged.

1169
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:01,740
But I would never need
the bells to ring for me

1170
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:05,516
for I'd hear them always in the
memory of my father's voice.

1171
01:27:05,516 --> 01:27:08,099
(gentle music)

1172
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:25,708
(soft music)

1173
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:40,114
(gentle music)

1174
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:50,038
(soft music)

1175
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:58,675
- This was my first feature film

1176
01:30:58,675 --> 01:31:03,314
and we produced it ourselves
with the help of our friends

1177
01:31:03,314 --> 01:31:07,481
and as such, you know, I
was free to make the film

1178
01:31:08,577 --> 01:31:10,973
the way I wanted to make it.

1179
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:14,406
And you know that's a rare experience.

1180
01:31:14,406 --> 01:31:16,668
(soft music)

1181
01:31:16,668 --> 01:31:20,184
I was directing a documentary
for National Geographic

1182
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:22,875
down in the Sea of Cortez in Mexico.

1183
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:27,148
It was called sea monsters
and we had a research boat

1184
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:30,302
and we were looking for a place to dock

1185
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:34,756
and I came upon this
shell of a resort area.

1186
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:37,105
I mean, there was absolutely nothing there

1187
01:31:37,105 --> 01:31:39,688
in this amazing Baja landscape.

1188
01:31:41,182 --> 01:31:42,015
The watchman.

1189
01:31:42,015 --> 01:31:43,769
The night watchman came out

1190
01:31:43,769 --> 01:31:46,663
and he was like this
throwback from the 60s.

1191
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:47,975
This old derelict, you know.

1192
01:31:47,975 --> 01:31:49,740
And I asked him about the resort

1193
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,684
and he acted as if it was complete.

1194
01:31:52,684 --> 01:31:55,233
To him it was the most
wonderful place in the world.

1195
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:58,184
And I thought got a deluded
character like that.

1196
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:00,524
What a wonderful character.

1197
01:32:00,524 --> 01:32:02,524
And the father daughter.

1198
01:32:03,922 --> 01:32:07,589
They came from a time
when I lived in Oregon

1199
01:32:08,432 --> 01:32:11,765
and there were like these gypsy families

1200
01:32:12,615 --> 01:32:16,198
that used to work
picking apples or fishing

1201
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:20,522
or kind of just doing odd jobs.

1202
01:32:20,522 --> 01:32:22,968
Moving up and down the pacific coast.

1203
01:32:22,968 --> 01:32:25,551
And I thought what would happen

1204
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:30,934
if a father and daughter pair of gypsies

1205
01:32:30,934 --> 01:32:34,140
went down into Baja with a dream

1206
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,445
of working in this fantastic resort?

1207
01:32:36,445 --> 01:32:37,748
What would happen to their dreams?

1208
01:32:37,748 --> 01:32:38,826
What would happen to their hopes?

1209
01:32:38,826 --> 01:32:40,723
How would it change their
relationship, you know,

1210
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:42,510
when it didn't pan out?

1211
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:47,370
And I guess that was the
inspiration for the story.

1212
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:50,631
Mexico offered such an
amazing and beautiful

1213
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:53,753
and incredible landscape
that it was like adding

1214
01:32:53,753 --> 01:32:57,503
this incredible production
value to our film.

1215
01:32:59,047 --> 01:33:03,516
The other thing with
we're shooting in Mexico

1216
01:33:03,516 --> 01:33:06,518
was working with the Mexican people.

1217
01:33:06,518 --> 01:33:10,408
I mean, they were absolutely wonderful.

1218
01:33:10,408 --> 01:33:13,929
They helped us not only in
terms of with the production,

1219
01:33:13,929 --> 01:33:16,362
but they were many of the actors,

1220
01:33:16,362 --> 01:33:18,778
the bit players in the film.

1221
01:33:18,778 --> 01:33:21,340
When you see a Mexican
policeman in the film,

1222
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,280
that's a real Mexican policeman.

1223
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,725
When you see the townsfolk,

1224
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:28,142
those are the real townsfolk from Laredo.

1225
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:34,101
I'd have to say my
favorite scene is the scene

1226
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:37,816
that inspired making the whole
film right from the get go,

1227
01:33:37,816 --> 01:33:41,399
which is when Shep goes
to the resort area,

1228
01:33:42,428 --> 01:33:46,261
finds out it's nothing
but a shell of a resort

1229
01:33:48,636 --> 01:33:52,400
and encounters Scully who
had lured him down there

1230
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,811
with this ridiculous prowess.

1231
01:33:54,811 --> 01:33:59,438
And the chemistry between the
two of them is so wonderful.

1232
01:33:59,438 --> 01:34:00,973
They really nailed it.

1233
01:34:00,973 --> 01:34:02,871
The humor is delightful.

1234
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,325
And it's a bittersweet moment,

1235
01:34:04,325 --> 01:34:07,359
but for me it worked very much.

1236
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:11,806
I guess there's a place in
my heart for lovable losers

1237
01:34:11,806 --> 01:34:14,510
and here you had two lovable losers

1238
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:16,483
trying to make amends.

1239
01:34:16,483 --> 01:34:18,400
So it was a good scene.

1240
01:34:19,582 --> 01:34:21,727
For me the most pleasant surprise

1241
01:34:21,727 --> 01:34:26,323
was the performance of our
young actress, Kirsten Carmody.

1242
01:34:26,323 --> 01:34:28,800
She came to the set so prepared.

1243
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,732
She was a real trooper.

1244
01:34:30,732 --> 01:34:32,500
It was her first time out of the country.

1245
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,630
Never been in a feature film before.

1246
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:36,642
She was in Mexico.

1247
01:34:36,642 --> 01:34:38,703
She had to speak some Spanish in the film

1248
01:34:38,703 --> 01:34:39,936
and she never studied Spanish

1249
01:34:39,936 --> 01:34:41,599
and yet she did beautifully.

1250
01:34:41,599 --> 01:34:42,572
She did fine.

1251
01:34:42,572 --> 01:34:46,659
She also had this wonderful
bubbly positive energy

1252
01:34:46,659 --> 01:34:50,099
that really helped out on the set

1253
01:34:50,099 --> 01:34:53,016
and I would say that her performance

1254
01:34:53,016 --> 01:34:55,973
in many way inspired everybody else

1255
01:34:55,973 --> 01:34:58,612
to give their best in the film.

1256
01:34:58,612 --> 01:35:01,384
She also had a beautiful voice

1257
01:35:01,384 --> 01:35:04,301
and she sang one of our theme songs

1258
01:35:06,068 --> 01:35:07,461
about halfway through the film

1259
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:12,113
and we use it on the soundtrack
and it's really lovely.

1260
01:35:12,113 --> 01:35:15,946
(singing in foreign language)

1261
01:35:17,446 --> 01:35:20,459
We actually shot "Coyotes" in only 12 days

1262
01:35:20,459 --> 01:35:23,997
and besides rehearsal time,
which helped us cut down

1263
01:35:23,997 --> 01:35:27,042
on the number of takes that we needed.

1264
01:35:27,042 --> 01:35:29,746
One of the keys was our location.

1265
01:35:29,746 --> 01:35:34,746
We shot about 40% of the film
in the hotel we stayed in.

1266
01:35:35,326 --> 01:35:36,321
The hotel had everything.

1267
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:37,382
It had a beach.

1268
01:35:37,382 --> 01:35:38,638
It had fishing boats.

1269
01:35:38,638 --> 01:35:39,971
It had an oasis.

1270
01:35:41,067 --> 01:35:44,637
It had, you know, rooms that would serve

1271
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:48,342
as our characters room
but would also serve

1272
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,794
as other locations, too.

1273
01:35:50,794 --> 01:35:52,769
And it looked like we
were all over the map,

1274
01:35:52,769 --> 01:35:56,436
but in fact we never
left the hotel grounds.

1275
01:35:57,693 --> 01:35:58,526
You know it's a cliche.

1276
01:35:58,526 --> 01:36:02,983
Everybody says we were
like a family on the set

1277
01:36:02,983 --> 01:36:06,872
and I'd have to say that in this case,

1278
01:36:06,872 --> 01:36:08,337
there were so few of us.

1279
01:36:08,337 --> 01:36:09,403
We had so much work to do.

1280
01:36:09,403 --> 01:36:13,283
We were thrown in together,
you know, for only two weeks

1281
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:16,648
and there was a real
nice sense of teamwork

1282
01:36:16,648 --> 01:36:19,270
and there truly was a sense of family.

1283
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:21,722
The most satisfying
thing for me was the fact

1284
01:36:21,722 --> 01:36:25,094
that when we had our
premiere, everyone showed up.

1285
01:36:25,094 --> 01:36:27,536
They all came on their own dime

1286
01:36:27,536 --> 01:36:32,536
and even the Mexicans flew up
from Baja for the premiere.

1287
01:36:33,096 --> 01:36:35,263
And to have everyone there

1288
01:36:36,133 --> 01:36:39,208
experiencing the premiere together

1289
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:41,030
was just absolutely wonderful.

1290
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:45,916
It was almost the true
reward for making the film.

1291
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:49,140
- Shep, the character that I portrayed

1292
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:53,882
was primarily a fisherman,
so he did a lot of fishing,

1293
01:36:53,882 --> 01:36:56,264
but more importantly I
think most of the work

1294
01:36:56,264 --> 01:36:58,906
went into Shep's biography,

1295
01:36:58,906 --> 01:37:01,697
which is usually what I do
any time I tackle a role

1296
01:37:01,697 --> 01:37:03,505
is try to create the character.

1297
01:37:03,505 --> 01:37:05,131
Who he is, where he came from.

1298
01:37:05,131 --> 01:37:06,119
Does he have a cat?

1299
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:07,698
You know, what his parents were like.

1300
01:37:07,698 --> 01:37:11,017
Just create a whole story so
that when it comes time to film

1301
01:37:11,017 --> 01:37:14,150
he's not as much of a stranger to me then.

1302
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:17,998
Shep plays the father to
an only child daughter

1303
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:20,593
and I am a father to an
only child who's a daughter,

1304
01:37:20,593 --> 01:37:23,844
so that was like a no
brainer as far as that goes.

1305
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:26,245
Also Shep is a bit of a wandering soul

1306
01:37:26,245 --> 01:37:28,440
and I've spent quite a bit of time

1307
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:31,955
in different areas of the
country over the past 20 years,

1308
01:37:31,955 --> 01:37:33,542
25 years in a lot of different places

1309
01:37:33,542 --> 01:37:37,612
and I'm comfortable in
that field running around,

1310
01:37:37,612 --> 01:37:39,612
checking out new things.

1311
01:37:40,976 --> 01:37:43,720
My relationship with my costars

1312
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:46,206
began obviously at the
very beginning of shooting.

1313
01:37:46,206 --> 01:37:50,225
Kirsten came to LA from Florida
and I came from New York

1314
01:37:50,225 --> 01:37:54,159
and we met at Kevin, the
director's apartment,

1315
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:57,503
and after a few hours discussing
a little about the script,

1316
01:37:57,503 --> 01:37:59,534
Kevin said look here's the $30.

1317
01:37:59,534 --> 01:38:03,362
You guys go to Salvation Army
and go get your wardrobe.

1318
01:38:03,362 --> 01:38:05,751
We spent two or three hours
at least I think that day,

1319
01:38:05,751 --> 01:38:07,786
maybe more at the Salvation Army

1320
01:38:07,786 --> 01:38:09,516
just sort of poking
around through the stuff.

1321
01:38:09,516 --> 01:38:10,349
And we had a lot of fun really

1322
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:11,550
kind of getting to know each other

1323
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,884
and trying to decide what
Shep and Nora might wear

1324
01:38:14,884 --> 01:38:16,103
and the kind of people they were.

1325
01:38:16,103 --> 01:38:19,609
So we had a lot of fun and it
kind of broke the ice for us,

1326
01:38:19,609 --> 01:38:21,932
so that we were able to perhaps

1327
01:38:21,932 --> 01:38:25,076
realistically portray father and daughter.

1328
01:38:25,076 --> 01:38:27,898
By the end of the film and we
shot mostly chronologically

1329
01:38:27,898 --> 01:38:30,556
as I recall so that some
of the more intense scenes

1330
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:33,332
towards the end we had
known each other pretty well

1331
01:38:33,332 --> 01:38:36,005
and had developed a real
affection for one another by then

1332
01:38:36,005 --> 01:38:40,088
and I think probably that
helped towards the end.

1333
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:44,215
Most difficult scene for me I think,

1334
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,379
coincidentally may have been also

1335
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:48,653
one of the most difficult times for Shep

1336
01:38:48,653 --> 01:38:52,255
when he realizes that he can't
keep toting around this kid.

1337
01:38:52,255 --> 01:38:53,093
She's 12 years old.

1338
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:55,676
She's a grown woman now almost.

1339
01:38:57,469 --> 01:38:58,922
The decision that he has to make

1340
01:38:58,922 --> 01:39:01,802
as a result of that realization,

1341
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:04,635
that was a pretty difficult scene.

1342
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:10,606
My favorite scene if I
could pick a favorite

1343
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:13,322
was probably maybe two of 'em,

1344
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:15,455
but one of 'em was the fireside scene

1345
01:39:15,455 --> 01:39:20,237
where Shep and Nora talk a
little bit about Nora's mom

1346
01:39:20,237 --> 01:39:22,539
and that also coincidentally was the scene

1347
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:24,582
that Kevin, the director, sent to me

1348
01:39:24,582 --> 01:39:28,809
to do as my audition tape
and I like that scene so much

1349
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:31,480
at that point I became pretty excited

1350
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,673
about the possibilities
of getting this role

1351
01:39:33,673 --> 01:39:35,985
just based on that scene
and I love doing that scene.

1352
01:39:35,985 --> 01:39:38,271
I think we only shot that once.

1353
01:39:38,271 --> 01:39:40,128
I mean, I wish we could've
shot it five times.

1354
01:39:40,128 --> 01:39:41,910
It was really fun to do it.

1355
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:44,238
But there was another scene, too,

1356
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:48,148
where the car breaks down and
the Mexican police show up,

1357
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,726
which was also kind of a scary scene

1358
01:39:50,726 --> 01:39:52,199
and I had never seen those police before.

1359
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:53,482
I had heard there was
gonna be some policemen

1360
01:39:53,482 --> 01:39:56,860
that were gonna show up
but that was a little bit.

1361
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,900
They were real Mexican police.

1362
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:01,378
We were in the middle of Baja
and it was a little scary.

1363
01:40:01,378 --> 01:40:05,295
(speaking in foreign language)

1364
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:09,806
The challenges of working on
a low budget feature I guess

1365
01:40:09,806 --> 01:40:12,670
really are aside from the
fact that there's no money

1366
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:14,956
and there's no time and there's no film.

1367
01:40:14,956 --> 01:40:16,840
Or if we're shot on
film and we're gonna get

1368
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,707
some film FedEx'd in from LA tomorrow

1369
01:40:18,707 --> 01:40:21,803
and you know that kind of stuff.

1370
01:40:21,803 --> 01:40:23,432
I guess it's continuity, you know,

1371
01:40:23,432 --> 01:40:25,373
and everyone sort of has to work together

1372
01:40:25,373 --> 01:40:27,227
because we don't have a lot of people

1373
01:40:27,227 --> 01:40:29,060
handling the different facets of the film

1374
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:31,765
and we're making script changes on the fly

1375
01:40:31,765 --> 01:40:33,429
and every night we're
having script meetings

1376
01:40:33,429 --> 01:40:34,786
because we have to make some adjustments

1377
01:40:34,786 --> 01:40:37,673
for tomorrow's shoot
because maybe we can't shoot

1378
01:40:37,673 --> 01:40:38,931
where we thought we were gonna shoot

1379
01:40:38,931 --> 01:40:40,089
or the weather's not right.

1380
01:40:40,089 --> 01:40:41,733
So a lot of changes like that.

1381
01:40:41,733 --> 01:40:44,211
I mean, sometimes if you're
shooting a big budget film

1382
01:40:44,211 --> 01:40:47,169
and the weather's not right,
maybe you don't shoot that day,

1383
01:40:47,169 --> 01:40:48,511
but we didn't have that luxury.

1384
01:40:48,511 --> 01:40:50,112
So and continuity, too.

1385
01:40:50,112 --> 01:40:52,273
I mean, did I have on the black shirt

1386
01:40:52,273 --> 01:40:53,655
or the blue shirt in that scene?

1387
01:40:53,655 --> 01:40:54,528
I think it was the blue shirt.

1388
01:40:54,528 --> 01:40:57,434
Hey Joe, was that the blue shirt?

1389
01:40:57,434 --> 01:40:59,184
I think the film was.

1390
01:41:00,913 --> 01:41:03,250
Considering all the
things that went into it,

1391
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:06,096
there's a couple of
scenes that perhaps I wish

1392
01:41:06,096 --> 01:41:07,708
I had done something differently

1393
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:09,511
or you know maybe I had another take

1394
01:41:09,511 --> 01:41:11,547
or we had done something a little.

1395
01:41:11,547 --> 01:41:15,008
But for the most part, there's
five or six scenes there

1396
01:41:15,008 --> 01:41:16,573
that are much stronger than I ever thought

1397
01:41:16,573 --> 01:41:17,464
that there would be.

1398
01:41:17,464 --> 01:41:18,903
They came off the page really well

1399
01:41:18,903 --> 01:41:21,105
and I mean I can't take
too much credit for that.

1400
01:41:21,105 --> 01:41:23,941
I'll be happy too but
really the cinematographer

1401
01:41:23,941 --> 01:41:26,858
and the director really had to take

1402
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:31,282
most of the credit for that
because I think the film

1403
01:41:31,282 --> 01:41:35,877
is really a great little film
showcasing a lot of talented,

1404
01:41:35,877 --> 01:41:40,877
a lot of work of the talented
people that were there.

1405
01:41:40,889 --> 01:41:44,247
- When I was preparing to play Nora,

1406
01:41:44,247 --> 01:41:47,985
I rehearsed with Leo at Kevin's apartment

1407
01:41:47,985 --> 01:41:50,234
and we would go through the script

1408
01:41:50,234 --> 01:41:53,372
and just talk about the characters,

1409
01:41:53,372 --> 01:41:55,335
and kind of create a character past,

1410
01:41:55,335 --> 01:41:57,717
and we did that once
we got to Mexico, too.

1411
01:41:57,717 --> 01:41:59,463
We talked about.

1412
01:41:59,463 --> 01:42:02,238
Leo and I talked about Nora and Shep

1413
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:05,150
and the past that they
had and the memories

1414
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:06,571
that they shared together.

1415
01:42:06,571 --> 01:42:09,621
I definitely brought elements
from my own life to Nora

1416
01:42:09,621 --> 01:42:11,216
of being a Navy brat.

1417
01:42:11,216 --> 01:42:12,677
I had moved around the country

1418
01:42:12,677 --> 01:42:15,408
and I'd gotten used to the starting over

1419
01:42:15,408 --> 01:42:18,032
and each new place and making new friends

1420
01:42:18,032 --> 01:42:20,622
and joining a new school
and a new community

1421
01:42:20,622 --> 01:42:22,665
every couple of years.

1422
01:42:22,665 --> 01:42:26,165
So I kind of had that in common with Nora.

1423
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:30,745
As far as challenging goes,

1424
01:42:30,745 --> 01:42:34,197
the shower scene was
definitely awkward for me

1425
01:42:34,197 --> 01:42:36,726
because I was about 14 years old

1426
01:42:36,726 --> 01:42:39,759
and I was in the shower with
several people in there.

1427
01:42:39,759 --> 01:42:42,396
I was wearing more clothes
than I wear at the beach.

1428
01:42:42,396 --> 01:42:43,680
You know, I was completely covered,

1429
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:44,964
but it was still very awkward

1430
01:42:44,964 --> 01:42:48,157
to have more than one person, you know,

1431
01:42:48,157 --> 01:42:50,119
in the shower at one time, you know,

1432
01:42:50,119 --> 01:42:51,431
directing you to grab the soap

1433
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:52,872
and put the shampoo in your hair

1434
01:42:52,872 --> 01:42:55,789
and it's just it's kind of strange.

1435
01:42:57,192 --> 01:43:01,188
Oh, my favorite scene in
"Coyotes" would have to be

1436
01:43:01,188 --> 01:43:02,486
sort of a bittersweet scene.

1437
01:43:02,486 --> 01:43:05,408
The one at the very end
where I'm dancing with Leo.

1438
01:43:05,408 --> 01:43:07,132
I'm dancing with my father.

1439
01:43:07,132 --> 01:43:09,220
And it's kind of bittersweet

1440
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,839
because we did film in
sequence pretty much

1441
01:43:11,839 --> 01:43:14,907
and it was sort of our goodbye dance

1442
01:43:14,907 --> 01:43:16,155
because it was the last scene

1443
01:43:16,155 --> 01:43:19,393
that Leo and I filmed together.

1444
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:23,257
So it was sort of sad but
it's definitely something

1445
01:43:23,257 --> 01:43:25,424
I'm always gonna remember.

1446
01:43:27,914 --> 01:43:29,257
I loved working in Mexico.

1447
01:43:29,257 --> 01:43:30,868
It was beautiful.

1448
01:43:30,868 --> 01:43:32,855
Baja is such an amazing place.

1449
01:43:32,855 --> 01:43:37,855
It's gorgeous and the people
are just so welcoming.

1450
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,423
That's what amazed me.

1451
01:43:39,423 --> 01:43:42,024
Just the community of
people that were just

1452
01:43:42,024 --> 01:43:44,586
so welcoming towards Americans

1453
01:43:44,586 --> 01:43:48,669
and just happy to have us
there and just so kind.

1454
01:43:50,072 --> 01:43:52,420
I learned a lot from "Coyotes".

1455
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,415
I observed a lot on set.

1456
01:43:54,415 --> 01:43:57,477
Just how things are done on set

1457
01:43:57,477 --> 01:43:59,566
in a professional environment like that.

1458
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:04,399
And it was just the whole thing
was a learning experience.

1459
01:44:05,696 --> 01:44:09,286
If I got the chance to meet up again

1460
01:44:09,286 --> 01:44:11,703
with the whole cast and crew,

1461
01:44:12,808 --> 01:44:14,339
I would probably say something like,

1462
01:44:14,339 --> 01:44:17,069
you guys wanna make another film?

1463
01:44:17,069 --> 01:44:19,993
'Cause it was a lot of fun and
I think everybody enjoyed it.

1464
01:44:19,993 --> 01:44:22,160
I think everybody had fun.

1465
01:44:23,888 --> 01:44:25,979
- Well the story was very moving

1466
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:28,804
and I knew that there were
a lot of things about it

1467
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:31,900
that would appeal to different audiences.

1468
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:36,900
So that's why it's an attractive
way to go for our producer.

1469
01:44:37,418 --> 01:44:41,444
The budget was truly a
low to no budget film

1470
01:44:41,444 --> 01:44:43,835
and I think the key for the producer

1471
01:44:43,835 --> 01:44:48,109
is to get as much preproduction
done as you possibly can

1472
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:50,672
before you ever go to location.

1473
01:44:50,672 --> 01:44:52,741
I think the best tool for a producer

1474
01:44:52,741 --> 01:44:55,522
on a low budget film is the script.

1475
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:59,212
If you have a script that inspires people,

1476
01:44:59,212 --> 01:45:03,415
then you've got that to
work with from A to Z

1477
01:45:03,415 --> 01:45:08,415
because everybody wants to
see those scenes being made.

1478
01:45:08,434 --> 01:45:13,101
It's important for the director
to communicate with them

1479
01:45:14,169 --> 01:45:18,919
and to express what he wants
or she wants in their vision

1480
01:45:21,102 --> 01:45:23,935
and to welcome input from the crew

1481
01:45:26,262 --> 01:45:29,337
and that was done everyday on the set

1482
01:45:29,337 --> 01:45:31,337
and it was a great team.

1483
01:45:33,838 --> 01:45:37,936
Working with the Mexicans
was wonderful in Laredo.

1484
01:45:37,936 --> 01:45:40,547
The town of Laredo is a fishing village

1485
01:45:40,547 --> 01:45:45,337
and they really seemed
interested in what we were doing

1486
01:45:45,337 --> 01:45:47,147
and they wanted to be involved

1487
01:45:47,147 --> 01:45:50,332
and they were so helpful and so warm

1488
01:45:50,332 --> 01:45:53,249
and it was great to work with them.

1489
01:45:54,863 --> 01:45:57,513
The biggest success for me as a producer

1490
01:45:57,513 --> 01:46:00,360
is that it's a great film.

1491
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,688
I'm really happy with it.

1492
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,952
And I also I think that everyone

1493
01:46:03,952 --> 01:46:07,452
who worked on the film feels the same way.

1494
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,527
My favorite scene they
added was the campfire scene

1495
01:46:13,527 --> 01:46:16,082
where Nora and Shep are
sitting at the campfire

1496
01:46:16,082 --> 01:46:17,967
and it's a long scene.

1497
01:46:17,967 --> 01:46:21,050
It's five minutes and very few shots.

1498
01:46:23,165 --> 01:46:27,082
But their acting and
their timing is just great

1499
01:46:28,053 --> 01:46:31,354
and it was just so much fun to work with

1500
01:46:31,354 --> 01:46:33,281
because they gave me the timing

1501
01:46:33,281 --> 01:46:34,963
and they gave me the pacing

1502
01:46:34,963 --> 01:46:39,963
and their expressions were
just so great to work with

1503
01:46:40,182 --> 01:46:43,932
and it's a kind of it's
a subtle editing job,

1504
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:48,242
so that most people wouldn't notice it,

1505
01:46:48,242 --> 01:46:51,660
but for me it was the most satisfying.

1506
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,929
We had a good run for the film festivals.

1507
01:46:53,929 --> 01:46:55,721
We entered several.

1508
01:46:55,721 --> 01:46:58,549
We were an audience
favorite in Palm Springs

1509
01:46:58,549 --> 01:47:01,705
and we won best feature in Savannah.

1510
01:47:01,705 --> 01:47:05,463
We also got our
distributor in Palm Springs

1511
01:47:05,463 --> 01:47:09,530
and you know the film festivals
are what you make out of 'em

1512
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:13,863
and you just find out what
you want to do with them.

1513
01:47:16,204 --> 01:47:20,234
We used the film festivals
to get our films shown

1514
01:47:20,234 --> 01:47:22,401
and I feel great about it.

1515
01:47:24,492 --> 01:47:26,582
- [Narrator] For as long
as she can remember,

1516
01:47:26,582 --> 01:47:30,461
Nora has always called the road home.

1517
01:47:30,461 --> 01:47:31,961
From city to city.

1518
01:47:34,235 --> 01:47:38,650
Nora and her devoted
father struggle to survive.

1519
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:40,820
(coyote howling)
(soft music)

1520
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:43,078
Trying to find a better life.

1521
01:47:43,078 --> 01:47:44,851
- You didn't get the job, did you?

1522
01:47:44,851 --> 01:47:46,241
- [Shep] Have I ever let you down?

1523
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:48,658
(soft music)

1524
01:47:49,521 --> 01:47:52,604
- [Narrator] For Nora, life
is just about to begin.

1525
01:47:52,604 --> 01:47:55,001
- There's gonna be a dance
at sunset in the plaza.

1526
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:57,025
- There's not gonna be
any boys there I hope.

1527
01:47:57,025 --> 01:48:00,478
(speaking in foreign language)

1528
01:48:00,478 --> 01:48:02,525
- [Narrator] Just as Nora
starts to connect with others,

1529
01:48:02,525 --> 01:48:03,751
she is forced to break away.

1530
01:48:03,751 --> 01:48:04,818
- But where are we going?

1531
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:06,067
Why so soon?

1532
01:48:06,067 --> 01:48:07,752
- Because we got places to go.

1533
01:48:07,752 --> 01:48:09,235
We got things to do.

1534
01:48:09,235 --> 01:48:10,137
That's why.

1535
01:48:10,137 --> 01:48:11,428
- Why don't you let her stay with us

1536
01:48:11,428 --> 01:48:14,982
for awhile until you get settled?

1537
01:48:14,982 --> 01:48:16,655
- [Narrator] The more things change,

1538
01:48:16,655 --> 01:48:18,130
the more they stay the same.

1539
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:20,072
And Nora is quickly losing faith

1540
01:48:20,072 --> 01:48:21,981
in the one person who promises hope.

1541
01:48:21,981 --> 01:48:23,874
- Leave me alone.

1542
01:48:23,874 --> 01:48:25,034
- You're the stupid one.

1543
01:48:25,034 --> 01:48:27,405
- Who do you think I'm talking about?

1544
01:48:27,405 --> 01:48:29,837
But Nora, sometimes in life
when things don't pan out,

1545
01:48:29,837 --> 01:48:30,670
you just gotta move on.

1546
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:33,116
- Things never pan out and
we're always moving on.

1547
01:48:33,116 --> 01:48:35,334
- [Narrator] No matter
how far they travel,

1548
01:48:35,334 --> 01:48:37,373
they can never leave
their troubles behind.

1549
01:48:37,373 --> 01:48:38,708
- [Nora] We got company.

1550
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:40,805
- [Graciela] Next time
you get a crazy idea,

1551
01:48:40,805 --> 01:48:44,568
just go off by yourself and
do it and leave Nora with us.

1552
01:48:44,568 --> 01:48:46,886
- You know, sometimes I wish I had a home,

1553
01:48:46,886 --> 01:48:49,468
so I could be a runaway.

1554
01:48:49,468 --> 01:48:52,969
- [Narrator] Porchlight
Entertainment proudly presents.

1555
01:48:52,969 --> 01:48:54,839
- [Shep Voiceover] Even
if we make it back north,

1556
01:48:54,839 --> 01:48:57,316
I don't know what's there for me.

1557
01:48:57,316 --> 01:48:58,149
Or for her.

1558
01:48:58,149 --> 01:49:00,559
- Down here they treat me like a person.

1559
01:49:00,559 --> 01:49:01,392
Up there.

1560
01:49:02,967 --> 01:49:04,884
I'm just trailer trash.

1561
01:49:05,885 --> 01:49:08,468
