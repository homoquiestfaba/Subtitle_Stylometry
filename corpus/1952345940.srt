"YOU THINK 'CAUSE YOU'RE

1269
01:40:59,641 --> 01:41:01,643
PLEASE BE SEATED.

1270
01:41:05,147 --> 01:41:07,649
HAVING REVIEWED ALL THE
EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY...

1271
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:11,153
IN THE CASE OF THE PEOPLE
VERSUS JACOB RYAN, JUVENILE,

1272
01:41:11,153 --> 01:41:14,656
THIS COURT IS NOW PREPARED
TO RENDER JUDGMENT.

1273
01:41:15,157 --> 01:41:17,659
MARTHA TAVERNER'S DEATH,
IN THE OPINION OF THIS COURT,

1274
01:41:17,659 --> 01:41:21,163
WAS NEITHER PREMEDITATED
NOR DELIBERATELY CAUSED
BY THE DEFENDANT.

1275
01:41:21,163 --> 01:41:24,166
[ Spectators Murmuring ]

1276
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:28,670
THERE WAS A HEATED ARGUMENT,
A MUTUALLY RECKLESS STRUGGLE,
BUT NO CRIMINAL INTENT.

1277
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:32,174
[ Murmuring Continues ]

1278
01:41:34,176 --> 01:41:38,680
YOUNG MAN,
I'M ALSO MINDFUL THAT YOU'VE
EXPRESSED DEEP REMORSE;

1279
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,682
THAT YOU'VE MADE A FULL
AND FREE CONFESSION...

1280
01:41:40,682 --> 01:41:45,687
AND DONE SO AT YOUR OWN
INSISTENCE WITHOUT STIPULATING
A PLEA BARGAIN.

1281
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:51,193
NEVERTHELESS, YOU HAVE
A CLEAR CULPABILITY.

1282
01:41:51,693 --> 01:41:54,696
BY RUNNING AWAY,
BY COVERING UP
YOUR INVOLVEMENT...

1283
01:41:54,696 --> 01:41:56,698
IN THE DEATH
OF MARTHA TAVERNER,

1284
01:41:56,698 --> 01:41:59,701
YOU CAST GRAVE DOUBTS
ON YOUR OWN ACTIONS...

1285
01:42:00,202 --> 01:42:04,206
AND YOU SHORT-CIRCUITED
THE VERY PROTECTIONS
AFFORDED YOU UNDER THE LAW.

1286
01:42:07,209 --> 01:42:09,211
JACOB RYAN, PLEASE RISE.

1287
01:42:14,216 --> 01:42:16,218
- I FIND YOU GUILTY...
- [ Crowd Gasps, Murmurs ]

1288
01:42:16,218 --> 01:42:20,722
OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER
IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

1289
01:42:20,722 --> 01:42:23,725
I SENTENCE YOU TO BE TAKEN
FROM THIS PLACE AND CONFINED...

1290
01:42:24,226 --> 01:42:26,728
AT THE JUVENILE CORRECTION
FACILITY AT FRAMINGHAM...

1291
01:42:26,728 --> 01:42:29,731
FOR A PERIOD
NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS.

1292
01:42:29,731 --> 01:42:33,235
[ Spectators Murmuring ]
[ Gavel Bangs ]

1293
01:42:53,255 --> 01:42:55,757
STILL THINK
IT WAS WORTH IT?

1294
01:43:05,934 --> 01:43:10,939
[ Judith Narrating ]
MY FATHER HAD TO SERVE ALMOST
A YEAR FOR DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

1295
01:43:10,939 --> 01:43:15,444
JACOB WAS RELEASED ON PROBATION
AFTER TWO YEARS.

1296
01:43:15,444 --> 01:43:18,447
HE HAS TO GO TO COUNSELING,
THOUGH.

1297
01:43:20,449 --> 01:43:22,951
SO WE HAVE THEM BACK.

1298
01:43:22,951 --> 01:43:24,953
BUT NONE OF US IS FREE.

1299
01:43:24,953 --> 01:43:27,956
EACH OF US
IS MARKED FOREVER NOW.

1300
01:43:27,956 --> 01:43:30,959
BEFORE... AND AFTER.

1301
01:43:32,461 --> 01:43:34,463
I LOOK AT JACOB NOW...

1302
01:43:34,463 --> 01:43:37,466
AND I THINK ABOUT
HOW DIFFERENT OUR LIVES
MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

1303
01:43:37,466 --> 01:43:41,470
ALL OF US. AND THAT'S
THE SADDEST PART OF ALL.

1304
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:43,972
[ Jacob ]
HEY, JUDE, LOOK!

1305
01:43:47,476 --> 01:43:49,978
[ Judith ]
BUT LATELY, SOMETIMES,

1306
01:43:49,978 --> 01:43:53,482
I CAN FEEL MYSELF STARTING
TO COME ALIVE AGAIN.

1307
01:43:53,482 --> 01:43:55,484
AND IT'S SCARY, KIND OF.

1308
01:43:55,984 --> 01:43:57,986
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S EVEN ALLOWED.

1309
01:43:59,988 --> 01:44:04,993
MAYBE YOU CAN'T EXPECT
TO KEEP HAPPINESS OUT
OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER,

1310
01:44:04,993 --> 01:44:07,996
ANY MORE THAN TROUBLE.

1311
01:44:07,996 --> 01:44:12,000
YOUR WHOLE LIFE CAN CHANGE
IN A SECOND,

1312
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,503
AND YOU NEVER EVEN KNOW
WHEN IT'S COMING.
