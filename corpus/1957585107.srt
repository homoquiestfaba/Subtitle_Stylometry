00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,418
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,599
(light piano music)

3
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:23,840
(telephone ringing)

4
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,720
- [Brian] Hi, this is Brian.

5
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,637
At the tone, please leave
me a message, thanks.

6
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:55,405
(patrons chattering)

7
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:08,370
- You mean all the way down here?

8
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,367
Wherever you want.

9
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:11,634
- Um, right there.

10
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:15,301
- Whoa, close, not good
for your eyes, okay.

11
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:20,560
Are you sure you wanna
see this movie again, huh.

12
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,990
You seen it what, 17 times?

13
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,823
- Seven.

14
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:23,760
- Oh, only seven.

15
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,720
Oh man, I'm hungry.

16
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,230
- [Murray] Sandra, do you realize

17
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,212
you are not wearing your shoes?

18
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:35,635
(audience laughing)

19
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,560
- [Albert] Uh, Miss Markowitz
and I have been asked

20
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,640
by the Social Service unit
from the Child Welfare Board

21
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,970
to investigate and examine.

22
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,110
- I didn't know what you wanted,

23
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,787
so I got a little bit of everything.

24
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:46,730
- Oh, thanks.

25
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:49,810
- Good for his teeth.

26
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,790
- [Murray] Won't you sit down.

27
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,314
I'll just get rid of these things.

28
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:55,314
(audience laughing)

29
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:57,520
- [Albert] I investigate and examine

30
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,671
certain pupils of the Revere School

31
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:00,930
- [Claudia] Rock.

32
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,763
- [Joshua] And Rover.

33
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:02,837
- [Claudia] Mike.

34
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:03,670
- [Tom] Yeah, that's good.

35
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,503
- Marty.

36
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:05,336
- Who's next?

37
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:06,169
- Uh, Monty.

38
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,002
- Um, Snookie.

39
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,180
- Uh, Woodrow, uh, Chevrolet.

40
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,013
- Bluemont, Rex.

41
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:10,300
- Lefty, The Phantom.

42
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,960
- And Chip and there's one more.

43
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,388
- There's one more, there's
one more, there's one more.

44
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:14,242
- Um, Raphael Sabatini!

45
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:17,420
- Hey, you're really a nut
for this picture too, huh?

46
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,480
- Yeah, I even beat Joshua.

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,720
This is my eighth time.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,390
- Hey sport, what do you say,

49
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,680
why don't we invite Claudia here

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,490
to join us for your birthday dinner, huh?

51
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,270
- Oh no, no, don't be silly.

52
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,274
I don't wanna butt in, really.

53
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:35,090
Well, happy birthday though, are you 10?

54
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,550
- Yeah, how do you know?

55
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,110
Did he tell?

56
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,560
- I'm a good guesser and I
have 14 nieces and nephews.

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,190
- I guess you can come if you want.

58
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,180
- Oh no, really, thank you.

59
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,180
I don't wanna intrude, really I don't.

60
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,510
- No no no, no, come on, come on.

61
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,310
It's a tradition, you
get cake, then lobster.

62
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,620
- Oh, I think I'm too
conservative to eat cake first.

63
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
I don't know about that.

64
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,200
- Hey Jerry, the cake is great, thanks.

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,150
- [Jerry] Anytime.

66
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,600
- Happy birthday, sport.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,620
- Oh, thanks Dad, this is great.

68
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,120
My favorite, chocolate.

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,740
- I know what you like.

70
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,055
Hey Diane, can I get a
knife and some plates?

71
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:14,960
- [Diane] Sure.

72
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,950
- No candles, no singing?

73
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,090
- Nah, we don't believe in
making wishes, do we Josh?

74
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,400
- Gee, I'm about 75% wishes and dreams.

75
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
- Well, don't you think
it's kind of embarrassing

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,104
for people to start singing?

77
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:29,521
(Tom laughs)

78
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:32,145
- [Diane] Here you go.

79
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:36,730
- All right, here we go.

80
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:38,685
Do the honors?

81
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,220
- Okay.

82
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,570
- [Claudia] How is it?

83
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,490
- Mm, it's great.

84
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,290
How should I cut it?

85
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,600
- Well uh, oh, right across there.

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,433
- [Joshua] Here?

87
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,323
- [Tom] Yeah.

88
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:53,049
- [Joshua] Okay.

89
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:56,049
(diners chattering)

90
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:03,774
- Good morning, Stephanie.

91
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,150
Do you have anything for me?

92
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,983
Thanks.

93
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,786
Good morning.

94
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,619
- Good morning.

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,713
- Claudine.

96
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,680
- What's this?

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,550
- I just won $13.00 in the lottery,

98
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,570
and I thought I'd share the booty.

99
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,403
- [Claudia] Thanks.

100
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:30,740
- You're very welcome.

101
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,050
What's with the Blast account?

102
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,070
- Oh well, the photos aren't that good,

103
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,050
but I can't get too
upset about that today.

104
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,470
- Why, oh, what happened to you?

105
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,990
Did Brian finally propose?

106
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,480
- Ah, hardly.

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,800
No, he stood me up.

108
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,230
I called him for two hours.

109
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,700
He didn't answer the phone, he's history.

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,533
- Well, I know that look.

111
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:52,210
I've seen it too many times before.

112
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,500
You met someone, well?

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,130
- The most incredible guy.

114
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,500
- I knew it, where?

115
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,333
- At the movies.

116
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,770
- A Thousand Clowns again.

117
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,020
- (chuckles) It's his son's favorite.

118
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,320
- Oh great, that's swell.

119
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,090
Did the whole family go,
just the four of you?

120
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,470
- He's divorced, I guess.

121
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,030
- [Nick] And of course, you didn't ask.

122
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,863
- No.

123
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,550
- What about his dating record?

124
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,330
- Nick, don't be so skeptical.

125
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,995
- Well, it's just that
you're such a Gidget.

126
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:21,220
(knocking on door)

127
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,120
Tell me, is he the fabulous blond hunk?

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,100
Is he everything you always wanted?

129
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,030
- Claudia Casara?

130
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,110
- Oh, please.

131
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,850
- His name is Tom.

132
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,200
Yeah, he's an architect.

133
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,980
Uh, at the movies.

134
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,125
Well, he was with his.

135
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:39,958
(knocking on door)

136
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,790
Oh Mom, I gotta go, he's here.

137
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,250
Yeah, yes, I'll go slow, Mother.

138
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,150
Okay, I love you, bye.

139
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,073
- Hello.

140
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:55,906
- [Claudia] Hi.

141
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:56,739
- Hi, for you.

142
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,310
- Oh, they're beautiful, thank you.

143
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,710
- You are too.

144
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,970
- (giggles) Thanks, um, I'm
gonna go give them some water.

145
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,356
I'll be right back.

146
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,189
- Okay.

147
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,110
I would dream about houses,

148
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,480
and I made models with toothpicks and gum.

149
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,260
I had them hanging off
the sides of cliffs.

150
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,070
Is this, is it boring you?

151
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,270
- Oh, no no, not at all.

152
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,240
- At any other time in history,

153
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,630
I would've built churches, cathedrals,

154
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,940
but now, I built a better mall, you know.

155
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,389
Compatible with the landscape,

156
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,890
but I'm working on one house,

157
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,390
and it's, well, it's really
quite something, you know.

158
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,200
I would love you to see it.

159
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,033
- I'd like to.

160
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:40,866
- It's very daring.

161
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,690
- I worry about how things look too.

162
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,250
How images affect people,
especially children.

163
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,830
I guess that's why I wanna
illustrate children's books.

164
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,160
What?

165
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,770
- Nothing, I'm, I'm,
I'm just looking at you.

166
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:05,520
You're so lovely and bright, shiny,

167
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,940
and lit up from the inside.

168
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,450
Relax, I'm not gonna hurt you.

169
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,563
You are shy.

170
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:46,300
Are you afraid of me?

171
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,870
- You're a little fast for me.

172
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,100
- Oh oh, hey, all right.

173
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,429
Thank you, I had a wonderful evening.

174
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:52,450
- (giggles) Me too.

175
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,500
- I do have to leave town
very early in the morning.

176
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,970
Maybe we could get
together over the weekend.

177
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,803
- Mm hmm.

178
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,840
- Maybe you could come out to the beach.

179
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,673
- Mm hmm.

180
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,180
- I'll call you from Denver.

181
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:13,513
- Um (clears throat).

182
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,188
- Goodnight.

183
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:20,188
- Goodnight.

184
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:34,801
- Come on buddy, come, come on.

185
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,270
Okay, good boy, sit, sit.

186
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,690
Good boy, now, stay.

187
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,940
Oh, you're my pal, you're
such a good doggie.

188
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,523
- Hey Joshua!

189
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,020
- I wonder if this one
will pretend to like us.

190
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:57,330
Yeah, come on, come on Chuckles.

191
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,820
Stay Chuckles, come here.

192
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,890
Hi, this is Chuckles, Chuck for short.

193
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,240
- Oh, Chip, Chip, Chipper
Monkey (chuckles).

194
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,150
- My dad's always late.

195
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,240
You wanna cup of coffee?

196
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,310
- Sure.

197
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,010
- Okay, come on Chuckles, come on.

198
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,870
Come on, come on boy.

199
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,050
- Leo, my acupressurist
says I'll make buku bucks.

200
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,760
Oh no, he's part healer, part Edgar Cayce.

201
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,770
Hi, I'm Sandy.

202
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,890
- Hi.

203
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,060
- All the negative energy
is just being cleared

204
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,110
right out of my life.

205
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,450
No, his uncle was Clark
Gable's ex-partner, okay.

206
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,440
Okay, ciao.

207
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:03,691
- Um, filberts, carob, and macadamia.

208
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,910
- Thank you, so, who's Sandy?

209
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,470
- Well, she's supposed
to be my babysitter,

210
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,920
but she's always talking this
weird stuff on the phone.

211
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,540
She's lasted three months so far.

212
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,810
- Well, who took care of you before that?

213
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,520
- Well, I pretty much take care of myself,

214
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,520
but before her was um, Emelda, Mrs. Cross,

215
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,851
Greta, Concepcion, and then there was um.

216
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,851
(telephone ringing)

217
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,350
Hello, oh hi, Dad.

218
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:42,406
Yeah, yeah, okay.

219
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,920
It's for you, it's my dad.

220
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,770
- Hi, no no, no, don't worry, it's okay.

221
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,320
Josh is taking good care of me.

222
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,810
Yeah, that sounds great.

223
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,590
Okay, Old Topanga Road, two lefts.

224
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,360
All right, I'll be there soon.

225
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,400
Me too, goodbye.

226
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,430
- Excuse me, just for a little bit, okay.

227
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,400
I'm sorry, clients always
screw up the schedule,

228
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,720
but they're getting ready to leave.

229
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,580
Oh, I missed you.

230
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,220
Boy, I forgot how cute you are.

231
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,820
- Well, I'm glad to see you too.

232
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:51,420
Oh, this is beautiful.

233
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,220
- Watch your step.

234
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,230
- Oh, it's incredible.

235
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,690
- I couldn't stop thinking
about you in Denver.

236
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,340
Am I still too fast for you?

237
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,800
- Oh, I don't exactly trust myself.

238
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,160
- You know, this is so crazy.

239
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,450
I think I love you.

240
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,962
(light piano music)

241
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,800
- [Claudia] Oh, what about Josh?

242
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,180
- [Tom] Would you stop
worrying about Josh.

243
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,830
Look, he's a self-reliant realist.

244
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,060
He's got both his feet on the ground.

245
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,770
- Doesn't he ever spend the
weekend with his mother?

246
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,800
- I don't even know where she lives.

247
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,730
She only came to visit him
once or twice last year.

248
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,820
- It must be hard for you
raising him all by yourself.

249
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,640
- Oh no, he practically raises himself.

250
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,940
He has been getting himself up

251
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,000
and dressed since he was five.

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,743
Makes his own breakfast.

253
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:16,400
Puts himself to bed.

254
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,545
Drives himself to school.

255
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:19,500
(both laughing)

256
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,251
- Since he was five?

257
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,250
- Yep, yeah yeah.

258
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
asked you so many questions.

259
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,380
- That's okay, don't apologize.

260
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,553
- [Claudia] Hi.

261
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:14,701
- Hi.

262
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:29,000
- Do you make coffee every morning?

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,110
- Sure, don't you?

264
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,973
- Yeah, I do.

265
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,950
Um, do you think it would be all right,

266
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,330
if I came out with you and your dad

267
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,930
on your little Sunday adventure?

268
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,160
- Well, you make it sound like a TV show.

269
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,460
Doesn't matter what I think.

270
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,020
Why don't you ask him?

271
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,853
- I did.

272
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,320
- What did he say?

273
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,370
- He said to ask you.

274
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,456
- He did?

275
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,150
- [Claudia] Mm hmm.

276
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,790
- Good morning, hey squirt.

277
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,010
- [Joshua] Hi, Dad.

278
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,730
So, where are the three of us going today?

279
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:08,732
- Uh, I don't know.

280
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:09,850
We were just talking about, you know.

281
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,000
- Well I, I don't know
what I was thinking.

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,540
I gotta go work on my book.

283
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,373
- [Tom] Well, Claudia.

284
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,640
- No really, thanks for
the invitation though, bye.

285
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,300
No, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, bye.

286
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,670
Nick wanted me to go to
Palm Springs with him.

287
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,810
Yeah, I know it sounds like fun,

288
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,230
but I gotta wait for Tom
to get back from San Diego.

289
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,850
I don't know, about an hour or so.

290
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,680
Yeah, weekends mostly.

291
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,230
Look Mom, I gotta go get ready.

292
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,050
Yes Mom, I know all about safe sex.

293
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm the one who told you, remember?

294
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,150
I will, okay, I love you, bye Mom.

295
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:07,579
(telephone ringing)

296
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,950
Hello, hi, where are you?

297
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh great, no, I understand.

298
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,010
It's just that I could've gone

299
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,810
to Palm Springs with my friend Nick.

300
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,380
My friend from work, Nick.

301
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,810
My best friend, you know, no, nevermind.

302
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,010
What, I'm working on my book.

303
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Her car is broken, how will he get home?

304
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,680
No, no, it's okay.

305
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,490
No, it's okay, I will.

306
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,740
Yeah, Agora Elementary School.

307
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,870
Me too, okay, bye.

308
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,152
(horn blowing)

309
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:03,504
(light country music)

310
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,260
Hi, Josh.

311
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,900
- Hi, is Dad okay?

312
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,990
- Yeah, he's fine.

313
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,090
A main burst at the sight.

314
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,923
He couldn't leave.

315
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm sorry you had to wait so long.

316
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,800
- It's okay, I'm used to it.

317
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,350
Just as long as he's all right.

318
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:28,700
Does my dad know you listen
to that redneck music?

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,450
- [Claudia] (chuckles) Get in here.

320
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:42,500
- [Joshua] Oh, missed that one, yeah.

321
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,340
- Hi, may I come in?

322
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,173
- [Joshua] Sure.

323
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,940
- Is this a picture of your mom?

324
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,220
- [Joshua] Her name's Kit.

325
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,470
- You have the same eyes.

326
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,830
When was the last time you saw her?

327
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,800
- [Joshua] Last summer, I guess.

328
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,080
- Do you ever see any other relatives?

329
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,100
- Well, I saw my dad's parents two times.

330
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,040
They live in this mansion
and they have a tennis court.

331
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,210
- Oh, that sounds neat.

332
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,450
- Dad doesn't like it there.

333
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:24,080
You know, you don't have to
hang out with me, Dad doesn't.

334
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,140
- Well, I just thought we
could play a game or something.

335
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,890
- I'm not as dumb as a
regular 10 year old, you know.

336
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,330
- I can tell.

337
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,080
I really do just wanna play a game.

338
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,520
- Is that because you have
14 nieces and nephews?

339
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,650
- I'm flattered you remember.

340
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,003
Nine.

341
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:42,836
- 10.

342
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:43,669
- [Claudia] Jack.

343
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,549
- Queen.

344
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,440
- [Claudia] Oh, um, um,

345
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,920
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, King, Ace.

346
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,850
- Ace, I got one too.

347
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,140
Um um, three!

348
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,240
- [Claudia] Four, yes!

349
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,060
- Oh no, no, I lost it.

350
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,060
- One, two, three, spit.

351
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,350
- [Claudia] Spit, eight, seven!

352
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,520
- Good job, queen, oh, no no no.

353
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Jack, Queen, King, nine,
um, three, um, Queen, King.

354
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,727
- Wait, wait, wait,
you're killing me here.

355
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,666
- Three, two, um, three, I got it!

356
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,330
I got it all alone with that one!

357
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,260
- Claudia.

358
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,140
- [Claudia] Hmm?

359
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,040
- Move in with me.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,650
- I don't know,
everything's going so fast.

361
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,820
- Come on, we're great together.

362
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,710
It doesn't get any better than this.

363
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,060
- How would Josh feel?

364
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,060
- Josh, you are the first female

365
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,220
that he's liked since Mrs. Cross.

366
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,673
- He's just glad I
helped get rid of Sandy.

367
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:09,170
(both laughing)

368
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,080
- Yeah, that too,

369
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,170
and you are the first
woman that I really like.

370
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,870
- Oh yeah, since who?

371
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,822
- Mrs. Cross.

372
00:22:22,822 --> 00:22:25,489
(both laughing)

373
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:31,810
Come on, come on, move in with us.

374
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,810
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

375
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,573
(light piano music)

376
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,253
- [Claudia] Hey guys, lunch.

377
00:22:57,253 --> 00:22:59,980
Lunch, come on.

378
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,910
- Touchdown!

379
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,910
- Oh no!

380
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,240
- [Claudia] Uh, did
anybody ever use that oven?

381
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,069
- Well, we mostly nuke food around here.

382
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,170
- Oh, you don't even have dried parsley.

383
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,510
I'm gonna have to grow my own.

384
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,343
- Wait a second.

385
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,920
Wait, there's no cheese, is there?

386
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,210
- Why, why no cheese, you eat pizza.

387
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,550
- Only pizza, I can't be around
any other kind of cheese.

388
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,860
It smells like throw up,

389
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,620
and I always have to leave the room.

390
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,820
- (laughing) come on, sit down.

391
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,280
- No, no, no, no.

392
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,650
- [Tom] Sit down, you huge liar.

393
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,220
- [Claudia] There is no cheese.

394
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,310
- Where'd you get these
biscuits, they're great.

395
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,430
- I baked these biscuits in the oven.

396
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,263
- [Tom] No way.

397
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,151
- Yes, I did.

398
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:39,424
- You're the greatest.

399
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:42,870
- No nukes, Josh.

400
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,453
- Salad, all right.

401
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:49,887
(crowd laughing and shouting)

402
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,519
Watch me now.

403
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,665
(crowd laughing and shouting)

404
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:05,507
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, look out!

405
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:09,340
(crowd laughing and shouting)

406
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,721
Okay, who wants the big one?

407
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:23,554
(whimsical music)

408
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:40,693
Be careful, you all right?

409
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:45,946
(whimsical music)

410
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:55,518
- That was great, that
was great, hey Chuckles.

411
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:56,351
- I need something green,
I'm making a salad.

412
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,514
- Ooh, we got a message.

413
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:00,350
- [Tom] You wanna grab it.

414
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,100
- [Kit] Hi guys, uh, this is, it's Kit.

415
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,292
I was just calling, I don't know.

416
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,520
How is everybody?

417
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm, I'm working part-time
at a dancing school here.

418
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,613
I'm in Seattle.

419
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,050
It's okay, I mean, I'm okay.

420
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,390
I hate these machines.

421
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,100
Uh, I'll talk to you later Josh, bye.

422
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,630
- When was the last time
you saw your parents?

423
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,010
- Claudia, not everybody

424
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,210
has a great relationship
with their parents,

425
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,820
or calls their mother four times a week.

426
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,400
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything.

427
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,530
I just thought it would be nice

428
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,980
for Josh to have some family.

429
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,410
- Things are not so warm
at my old Chicago home.

430
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,250
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought it up.

431
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,540
- It's okay, you can ask me anything.

432
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,410
- What's Kit like?

433
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,180
- Now, don't get jealous about her, baby.

434
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,550
She left five years ago.

435
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,700
Besides, you are so much
cuter and down to earth.

436
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,330
- Hey, she left when Josh was five?

437
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,060
- Right before his birthday.

438
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:48,617
(speaking in foreign language)

439
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:49,450
- Josh!

440
00:26:57,104 --> 00:26:58,740
- Well, how do I look?

441
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,070
- Not too scary.

442
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,780
Is this your costume?

443
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,860
- I think Halloween's dorky,

444
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,960
but I met this new friend, Rafe,

445
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,120
he just moved here from New York,

446
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,760
and he's taking me to some party.

447
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,810
- Well, that's great.

448
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:13,260
- Not to me, but I don't
have too many friends,

449
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,880
so I said okay.

450
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,560
- So, what're you supposed to be?

451
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:20,271
- [Joshua] A grownup.

452
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,531
- Oh.

453
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:24,448
(doorbell ringing)

454
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,810
- [Joshua] Oh, hi Rafe.

455
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,000
- [Rafe] Hi.

456
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,370
- Oh wow, you look
incredible, look at this.

457
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,940
- My mom's waiting in the car.

458
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,010
Is it okay if you don't come
home till 11 on a school night?

459
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,470
- I don't know.

460
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,300
- You better go ask your mom.

461
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,133
- Okay, I will.

462
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,740
- Look Josh, now, I'm just
gonna be a couple of minutes,

463
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,090
and I want you to wait
in the car, all right?

464
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,570
- [Joshua] Well, Chuckles
can stay in the car.

465
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,545
- No, Josh, don't argue with me.

466
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:58,378
I want you to wait in the car.

467
00:27:58,378 --> 00:28:00,210
You didn't bring his leash,
you have to stay with him.

468
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,043
- He'll be okay.

469
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:02,740
Chuckles is an incredible dog.

470
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,816
- [Claudia] Stay in the car, Josh.

471
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,848
- No no, no, Chuckles, Chuckles!

472
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:06,681
- Chuckles!

473
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:09,732
- [Joshua] Chuckles!

474
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:12,500
(tires screeching)

475
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,890
No, oh no, Chuck, no.

476
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,836
(Chuckles whining)

477
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:19,880
- Josh, it'll be all right, let me see.

478
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:24,270
Easy Chuck, you're gonna be all right.

479
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,930
Could someone please help me
get the dog in my car, please?

480
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,698
Josh, leave him alone.

481
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,183
- [Woman] Good girl, good girl.

482
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:36,016
Oh, that's a girl.

483
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:36,849
- [Man] She's beautiful.

484
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:41,260
- [Woman] Oh, thank you, thank you.

485
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,830
- Um, how long is it gonna be for my dog?

486
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,570
- Josh, Chuckles is gonna be okay.

487
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,403
Now, he's pretty banged up,

488
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,050
and he's got a few broken bones,

489
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,950
but he's gonna be okay.

490
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,950
Now, there's gonna be someone
here with him all the time,

491
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,730
and you can call and check
on him anytime you want to.

492
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,760
- It's all my fault.

493
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,580
- No, this was an accident.

494
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,530
- I don't cry, I don't cry, I never cry.

495
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,710
- I know, and you don't believe in wishes,

496
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,110
and Halloween is dorky.

497
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,220
It's okay, it's all right to cry.

498
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,470
The dog was just lying there
and I thought he was dead,

499
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,570
and all I could do was yell at Josh

500
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,160
about how irresponsible he was.

501
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,190
- So, where is dear old dad all this time?

502
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,520
- He was working, Nick.

503
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,400
Can't you have any sympathy for Josh?

504
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,110
- Sympathy, honey, my
mother remarried five times.

505
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,896
I have sympathy, I even have empathy,

506
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,440
but that's not the point.

507
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,640
My allegiance is to you.

508
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,210
You know, three months ago you
didn't even wanna have kids.

509
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,280
You wanted a career instead.

510
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,560
- Well now, I don't know.

511
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,610
That was before Josh.

512
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,830
- Claudia, you're not the kids mom.

513
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,580
Even if Rafe thinks you are.

514
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,843
You know, you hardly ever mention Tom.

515
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,420
Which one of these boys
are you in love with?

516
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,280
- Both, isn't that okay?

517
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:30,471
- I don't know.

518
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm starting to get a little nervous.

519
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,880
- Uh, starting?

520
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,713
- Yeah.

521
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,910
- Nick, you have been
suspicious from day one.

522
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,743
- Oh stop, I have not.

523
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:39,820
- No, I listened to you about
hanging on to my apartment,

524
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,920
now what more do you want from me?

525
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,390
- I don't know, more of your time.

526
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,240
You know, I never see you
outside the office anymore.

527
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,010
Do you know that your mother is calling me

528
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,240
to find out how you are.

529
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,090
Do you know that?

530
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:58,530
Come on.

531
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,460
- [Joshua] None for you Chuckles.

532
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:08,070
- Thank you, dude.

533
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,170
- Hi Mom, how are you?

534
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,650
Yeah, yeah, I know.

535
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,120
It's just that I've been
really busy lately, and I.

536
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,520
Well, I know the harvest
is your busiest time, and?

537
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,050
Yeah, I know you're really
disappointed, and I am too.

538
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:30,970
It's just that I wanna be here

539
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,850
to spend Christmas with Tom and Josh.

540
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:40,170
No, I haven't missed one in 28 years,

541
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,300
but just try and see this from my side.

542
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,970
I really hate not to be there.

543
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,110
Okay, I love you, Mom, bye.

544
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,270
Hey Josh, why don't you go
upstairs and go to sleep?

545
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,680
- No, he never goes to bed this early.

546
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,950
He likes to stay up and
watch the sports news.

547
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,220
- Tom, he's not watching anything.

548
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,340
He's falling asleep.

549
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,081
- No.

550
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:23,806
- Okay, I'm going to bed now.

551
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:24,639
Goodnight, Dad.

552
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:25,598
- Goodnight, dude.

553
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,838
- Goodnight, Claude.

554
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:31,310
- Goodnight.

555
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,220
- [Joshua] Goodnight Chuck.

556
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:37,808
(light piano music)

557
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:44,488
(Chuckles barking)

558
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:45,546
Watch it, Chuckles.

559
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,780
- Hey Chuck, watch out.

560
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,944
Put it over by the window.

561
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:48,777
Right in front of it.

562
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:49,610
Right there by the presents.

563
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,443
- Right there?

564
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:51,380
- Yeah, okay.

565
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,213
- Get outta here, Chuckles.

566
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:53,534
Chuckles, look out.

567
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:56,790
- [Claudia] Josh, whoa, whoa.

568
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,457
- [Joshua] I'll get the tinsel.

569
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:00,990
- No wait, wait wait,
wait wait, wait wait wait.

570
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,670
First lights, ornaments, then tinsel,

571
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,660
but first you gotta get me a knife,

572
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,114
so I can cut this cord, okay?

573
00:33:05,114 --> 00:33:05,947
- [Joshua] Okay.

574
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,210
- Hey Josh, the cookies are ready.

575
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,043
- Okay.

576
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,831
- [Tom] Hello.

577
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:17,510
- [Joshua] Dad, hey.

578
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,700
- Hey, sport, hey.

579
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,875
- [Claudia] Hey.

580
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,730
- Oh, what in the hell is all this?

581
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,540
Kind of looks like Olvera Street.

582
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,950
- It's Christmas,

583
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,760
or hadn't you noticed
it was December 20th?

584
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,593
- Look, Dad.

585
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,120
- Are you into all this junk now too?

586
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,700
Josh doesn't believe in
Santa Claus, do you sport?

587
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,370
- Well, I don't know.

588
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,920
Maybe we could check
it out just this year.

589
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,970
- [Claudia] I'm sorry about
all this Christmas stuff, Tom.

590
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,050
I didn't realize you felt
so strongly about it.

591
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,110
- Well, Josh and I have always avoided

592
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,630
all this holiday madness,

593
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,490
and I'm very surprised
to see him so into it.

594
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,440
- And disappointed.

595
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,240
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

596
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,930
- I know you're crazy
about this Christmas stuff,

597
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,660
and you did this for Josh.

598
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,000
Just don't get him all
dressed up as a wise man,

599
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,900
and expect me to come to some pageant.

600
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,440
- [Claudia] Okay now, we're
gonna leave for the airport

601
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,750
to pick your dad up in a little while.

602
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,710
- [Joshua] Well, first I want to fix

603
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,182
that broken pine cone on the wreath.

604
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,582
- [Claudia] Okay (chuckles).

605
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,360
- [Tom] Hi guys, it's me.

606
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,030
I got some bad news.

607
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,960
It's been snowing here since dawn,

608
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,710
and they're forecasting a blizzard.

609
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,070
Saying no flights will leave here

610
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,460
till tomorrow night at the earliest.

611
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,420
Sport, I'm sorry about this,

612
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,160
but hey, Claudia knows
where your presents are.

613
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,750
So, Merry Christmas and I'll
talk to you both later on.

614
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,200
- He's coming back, isn't he?

615
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,460
- Josh, of course he's coming back.

616
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,070
It's just that the planes
couldn't take off, that's all.

617
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,380
Hey, you know what?

618
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,810
If we're in the car in 15 minutes,

619
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,500
we can be at the farm
in an hour and a half.

620
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,498
- You mean your parents will let me come?

621
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:55,930
- [Claudia] You bet, and Chuckles too.

622
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,672
- Okay.

623
00:35:58,672 --> 00:35:59,740
- Okay, let go, come on.

624
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,029
(horn blowing)

625
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:15,455
(family laughing and shouting)

626
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,204
- [Man] Did you get caught in traffic?

627
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:18,217
- No, not at all.

628
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,160
It was completely clear.

629
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,100
- [Vera] Oh, I'm so glad you got here.

630
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,720
- Me too, Mom, this is Josh and Chuck.

631
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,230
Josh, Chuck, this is my mother, Vera.

632
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,800
- Hi Josh, how are you?

633
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,600
Hi Chuck, well, come on in.

634
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,950
We've been waiting for you.

635
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:34,810
- [Joshua] Are they all Casara's?

636
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,010
- Absolutely, come on, let's go.

637
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:39,940
- So, did you get any supper yet?

638
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,970
- [Claudia] No, and we're starved.

639
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,137
- Are you hungry, come on.

640
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,586
(family laughing and chattering)

641
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,820
It's lovely, darling.

642
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,090
I didn't know you still embroidered.

643
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,923
- [Claudia] Mm hmm.

644
00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,260
- I'll hang it up with the others.

645
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,550
Does Joshua spend Christmas
with his own mother?

646
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,810
- Well, she moves around a lot.

647
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,850
He only gets to see her
about once or twice a year.

648
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,948
Now, I don't know the whole story,

649
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:13,230
but I guess she was just
too young and too flakey,

650
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,820
couldn't handle it, so she took off.

651
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,459
- Well, a 10 year old is
a lot of responsibility.

652
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:21,420
- (chuckles) Yeah, a
real pain in the butt.

653
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,980
He interferes with my work.

654
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,630
He interferes with my whole life.

655
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,980
- I'm getting a little worried about you.

656
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,770
You're becoming so attached
to him, aren't you?

657
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,570
- No, I just like having someone

658
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,930
besides myself to worry about.

659
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,070
- [Vera] And Tom?

660
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:40,070
- Oh, he's smart, he's
charming, he's a great dad,

661
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,010
and he's enormously
generous about everything.

662
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,910
- Except his time.

663
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,910
- He works very hard, Mom.

664
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,190
- Well, that's all very admirable, dear,

665
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,660
but if he's so great,

666
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,510
why didn't he rearrange his schedule?

667
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,340
- Claudia, you look wonderful.

668
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:05,060
- Oh, Mom, this is incredible.

669
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,893
- Isn't he gorgeous.

670
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:06,726
- That's just huge.

671
00:38:06,726 --> 00:38:07,559
You want me to take this?

672
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,159
- Please, if you'll take that in, okay.

673
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,220
Yeah, you can take that.

674
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,650
Can you take these sweet
potatoes and the gravy too.

675
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:20,056
(family laughing and chattering)

676
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:23,973
(speaking in foreign language)

677
00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:35,229
(family cheering and applauding)

678
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:44,846
- [Luigi] Hey Bruno, how
about some cranberry sauce.

679
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:48,763
(speaking in foreign language)

680
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,912
(family chattering)

681
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,319
- [Tom] Hey, happy day after Christmas.

682
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:11,525
- [Joshua] Hey, Dad.

683
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:15,078
- Hey, oh, I'm sorry I
screwed up the holidays,

684
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:16,801
but I think I got a present here for you.

685
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:17,634
- [Joshua] Okay.

686
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:21,388
- Where is it, oh, it's the big one.

687
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:24,449
Whoa and it's heavy too, here you go.

688
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,282
- [Joshua] All right.

689
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,416
- There you go.

690
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,429
Hey, baby.

691
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:28,679
- [Claudia] Hi.

692
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:32,752
(light piano music)

693
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:40,949
- Oh, it's beautiful, thank you.

694
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:45,807
- [Joshua] Oh wow, oh my gosh.

695
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:46,640
- [Tom] You love it?

696
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,678
- Oh my gosh, look at this.

697
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:49,262
- [Tom] You can make your own
Thousand Clowns now, right?

698
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,268
- [Joshua] Oh my gosh, I can't believe it.

699
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:52,101
- I set it up for you.

700
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:52,934
Come here, come here.

701
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,657
Look at the Chinese food I got.

702
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:55,990
You guys hungry?

703
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,795
That's cool.

704
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,790
(light piano music)

705
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:13,036
Are you tired?

706
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:13,869
- Mm hmm.

707
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:17,499
- What else, you didn't like your present?

708
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,940
- No, no, I love it, it's beautiful.

709
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,770
Are we really headed anywhere?

710
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,810
- That's what's bugging you.

711
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,340
I thought you were still
burned up about Christmas.

712
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,690
- No, no, I was disappointed.

713
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,170
That still doesn't answer my question.

714
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,330
- I'm crazy about you and
about the three of us together.

715
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,560
We're headed wherever you want.

716
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,490
You wanna get married?

717
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,810
- Hi Claude, where's Dad?

718
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,643
- [Claudia] I don't know.

719
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:09,970
He said he'd be back by three, you hungry.

720
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,490
- No, I thought your book was done?

721
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:16,790
- No, the publisher sent it back.

722
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,810
They didn't want it.

723
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,310
- Probably got too many books.

724
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,460
What's so great about this gardening?

725
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:30,379
- Oh, I don't know.

726
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:34,240
I guess growing up on a farm
it just kind of relaxes me,

727
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,460
and it's fun to watch
things grow, like you.

728
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,180
Josh, cut it, cut it, give me the camera.

729
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,013
- [Joshua] No no, no.

730
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:42,846
- Give me the camera.

731
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:43,931
- [Joshua] No!

732
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:44,764
- Come on, come on, come on.

733
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:45,597
Come dance with me.

734
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:48,814
Come here, come here, okay, ready?

735
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,020
Put your arm in here.

736
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,218
Okay, now the other way, the other way.

737
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:55,051
- [Joshua] This way?

738
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:59,750
- [Claudia] Okay, this way.

739
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,688
- [Joshua] Maybe I can help.

740
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:01,623
- [Claudia] Think so?

741
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:03,256
- Does he move to the city,

742
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:05,289
because his parents are splitting up?

743
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,122
- No.

744
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:12,060
Okay, you ready.

745
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,893
- [Joshua] Yep.

746
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:14,283
- Okay, okay, whatever you do,

747
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:17,354
don't make a funny face,
don't make a funny (laughing).

748
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,604
Okay, fish face, fish face.

749
00:42:26,072 --> 00:42:28,989
(Claudia laughing)

750
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,020
- Hi, Josh.

751
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,853
- Hi, Kit.

752
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:57,930
- Are you ready to go
or uh, should I come in?

753
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,800
- You can come in.

754
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,100
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

755
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,840
- Josh, sorry it's so late,

756
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,700
but uh, it's for your birthday.

757
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,283
He moves, look.

758
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
(light piano music)

759
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:42,189
Are you hungry?

760
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,455
- No.

761
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,070
- Josh, I've uh, been thinking
about maybe moving down here.

762
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,100
We could see more of each other.

763
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,933
- Sure.

764
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,639
- You've grown so much
I hardly recognize you.

765
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,960
The alligator was a stupid idea.

766
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:25,375
You're too big for it.

767
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,120
- No, I like it, Kit, I really do.

768
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,200
- So, what's new?

769
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:35,870
How was Christmas?

770
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,920
- Oh, it was great.

771
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,260
Went to Claudia's parents farm.

772
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,500
They grow more almonds

773
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,950
than just about anybody
else in California, yeah.

774
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:46,980
There were about 15 people
at the dinner table,

775
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,800
and they were all related.

776
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,110
- Is Claudia your friend from school?

777
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,960
- Oh no, she's Dad's friend, you know.

778
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,000
- I know, and you like her a lot?

779
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,140
- Yeah, but she's different.

780
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,820
I mean, she really likes me.

781
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,280
- From the people that
brought you the moon.

782
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,720
Don't you think it's just
a little pretentious?

783
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,340
- Well Wax and Wane Productions

784
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,890
deserves something pretentious.

785
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,370
- What's with you?

786
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,160
Is it the book?

787
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,200
What time's the meeting with
your publisher this afternoon?

788
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,070
- It's 3:30.

789
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,250
- Honey, you'll be fine.

790
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,590
- No, no, that's not it.

791
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,600
- I felt really funny when
Josh's mom came to visit.

792
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,480
Like a cheater.

793
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,150
- A cheater, honey, I
can't believe this guy.

794
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,150
He gets a live in lover.

795
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,080
He gets a housekeeper.

796
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,970
He gets an extra mom for his kid.

797
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,440
- This isn't about Tom.

798
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,273
- [Nick] What's it about?

799
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:02,206
- This is about.

800
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:03,039
(telephone ringing)

801
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,803
I asked her not to put any calls through.

802
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:08,140
(telephone ringing)

803
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,973
Yes, Ava?

804
00:46:11,363 --> 00:46:12,830
Yeah, oh, okay.

805
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,188
It's Josh's school, yes.

806
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,220
- Oh, Josh's school.

807
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,110
- Well, what's wrong with him?

808
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:22,000
He did, no no, I'm not his mother.

809
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,370
No, I'm not his step-mother.

810
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,450
I'm not related to him.

811
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,950
Look, did you call his father?

812
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,680
Listen, I have a very important
meeting this afternoon

813
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,513
that I can't miss.

814
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:37,070
Don't you have a nurse or
an infirmary or something?

815
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,940
Well, not even until 4:30.

816
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,940
All right, all right, okay, yeah.

817
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,033
Don't say anything.

818
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:51,866
- Not a word.

819
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,320
- Okay Chuckles, get down.

820
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:08,064
How do you feel?

821
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,770
- Okay, sorry you missed your
meeting on account of me.

822
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,600
- Look, don't you worry about it.

823
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,300
You just worry about getting well.

824
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,790
Josh, what is it?

825
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,565
- Where did he go?

826
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:27,515
He's been coming home pretty
late for the last three weeks.

827
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,370
Maybe he's got a new girlfriend.

828
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,570
- What makes you think that?

829
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,770
- Well, three months is his usual limit.

830
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,120
You've lasted almost eight.

831
00:47:48,939 --> 00:47:50,650
- [Tom] Okay, you know what,
then let him sit there.

832
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,740
Let him sit at school and not pick him up.

833
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,573
- [Claudia] Where were you?

834
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:54,406
- [Tom] It was your choice.

835
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:55,239
I was at the sight.

836
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,242
- [Claudia] Why couldn't you pick him up?

837
00:47:56,242 --> 00:48:01,161
- [Tom] Because I couldn't
get away from the sight.

838
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,955
Look, I can't remember.

839
00:48:02,955 --> 00:48:05,705
(dramatic music)

840
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,850
- You lied to me.

841
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,840
Why did you say you wanted to marry me?

842
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,780
- Because I did,

843
00:48:19,716 --> 00:48:22,280
but you've got some magazine
concept of marriage.

844
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,030
I don't wanna be in the P.T.A.,

845
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,210
and Josh doesn't need Little League.

846
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,810
You're view is just, it's
way too middle class.

847
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,040
- Are you seeing someone else?

848
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,093
- Yes.

849
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,590
- What about Josh?

850
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,130
Your decisions affect his life, Tom.

851
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,830
He needs a family.

852
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,000
- Will you cut it out.

853
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,410
I mean, I know you love my son,

854
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,080
but don't make me a defective father.

855
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,080
- Well, you're the one
who left us alone so much.

856
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,913
What do you expect.

857
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:52,890
Are you jealous?

858
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:05,007
- Claudia look, you are very good for him,

859
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,150
but not so good for me.

860
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,240
This isn't working out, now maybe.

861
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,090
- I'm moving out.

862
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:32,661
(light piano music)

863
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,840
- I knew she'd leave us.

864
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:46,144
(light piano music)

865
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,260
- Everything is gonna be
the same between us, Josh.

866
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,310
I'm just not gonna live here, that's all.

867
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,120
Okay, I'm gonna call you.

868
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,650
We're gonna do lots of stuff together.

869
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:03,780
I still need your help on my book.

870
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,480
You can call me anytime you want to.

871
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,830
I left both of my numbers in your room.

872
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,280
I love you, Joshua.

873
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,290
- Claude, wait!

874
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:41,784
(Chuckles barking)

875
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,390
If I hadn't said anything
you wouldn't have to go.

876
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,720
- Oh no, no no, Josh, it's not your fault.

877
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,830
Now, I do have to go, but it
has nothing to do with you.

878
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,610
You're the reason that
I'm so sad to leave.

879
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,223
- Please don't, Claude.

880
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:03,820
I never really thought you were weird.

881
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,520
- I know, but I have to go.

882
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,010
- I'm never getting
married and having kids.

883
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,060
- Don't you say that.

884
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,760
Loving is good.

885
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,480
Now, sometimes it hurts,
but it's all that matters.

886
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,330
You wait and see, Josh.

887
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,820
You're gonna be the very best dad.

888
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:35,336
(light piano music)

889
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:53,453
- How you doing, sport?

890
00:51:54,509 --> 00:51:55,342
- Okay.

891
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:02,133
(telephone ringing)

892
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,820
- Hello, hi, great great, how are you?

893
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,590
Ah sure, he's right here, hang on.

894
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,370
It's your mom, Kit.

895
00:52:24,665 --> 00:52:25,683
- Hello.

896
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:29,060
- Hi, I'm coming down in June.

897
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,790
I got two weeks vacation.

898
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:36,643
Is that okay?

899
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,780
- Yeah.

900
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,900
- I'm gonna find a job and an apartment.

901
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,920
Say something, Josh.

902
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,922
- Like what?

903
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:50,760
- [Kit] I don't know,
like, like what you think.

904
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,473
- It's great.

905
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:00,540
- Okay good, is something wrong?

906
00:53:02,496 --> 00:53:03,595
- No.

907
00:53:03,595 --> 00:53:04,428
- [Kit] You sure?

908
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:06,843
- Yeah.

909
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,490
- Okay, then I'll see you then, okay?

910
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,160
- Bye.

911
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,993
- Bye.

912
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:21,510
- Did you tell her to call?

913
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,991
- No way.

914
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,240
- I don't believe you.

915
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,290
I'm going to bed now.

916
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,240
- Wait, you don't wanna stay up

917
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,810
and watch the end of the playoffs?

918
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:35,030
- In case you forgot, Dad, I'm only 10.

919
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,863
I need my sleep.

920
00:53:37,084 --> 00:53:37,917
- Well that's cool.

921
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:38,790
Whatever you say,

922
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,990
but don't forget we gotta get up early

923
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,890
to get the paper and the coffeecake.

924
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:42,980
- [Joshua] I'm not going.

925
00:53:57,939 --> 00:54:00,939
(light piano music)

926
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:05,524
(knocking on door)

927
00:54:05,524 --> 00:54:07,950
- [Tom] Can I come in?

928
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,783
- Yeah.

929
00:54:09,725 --> 00:54:13,140
- (sighs) Look Josh, I
wanna tell you something.

930
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,920
I know things seem real tough right now,

931
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,540
but when you get a little older,

932
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,800
you'll see that you can love
lots of people, not just one.

933
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
- You love too many.

934
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,839
(light piano music)

935
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,103
- Now, aren't you glad

936
00:54:51,103 --> 00:54:53,200
I convinced you to hand
onto your apartment?

937
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,953
- Thrilled.

938
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,340
- Well, at least you found out

939
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,940
you really do wanna be a mother.

940
00:55:01,058 --> 00:55:04,010
- But I wanna be Josh's mother.

941
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,150
- We all want stuff we can't have.

942
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:11,775
I'm tired of tearing about it.

943
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,060
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
asked you to come over today.

944
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,820
I'm not just fit for
human consumption yet.

945
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,300
- Stop, I just can't stand
how screwed up you are

946
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,520
over a 10 year old kid.

947
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,960
If it was the guy I could understand.

948
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:30,400
- Yeah, you know something?

949
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,170
I really don't miss Tom very much at all.

950
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,870
I'm just mad at myself
for being such a pushover,

951
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,600
and for staying too long at the fair.

952
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:54,025
(Tom and woman laughing and chattering)

953
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,910
- What do you suggest, Claudia?

954
00:56:31,176 --> 00:56:33,860
(Nick clears throat)

955
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,140
- Sorry, well, personally
I prefer this one.

956
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:41,370
- Tell her it's okay, Claude.

957
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:43,830
Tell her to let go of me.

958
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,050
- Ah, it's all right, Ava.

959
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,500
I don't think he's dangerous.

960
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,340
Um gentlemen, it you'll excuse me.

961
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,290
- Right, let's say tell you what.

962
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:55,790
Let's go to my office and uh,
I'll uh, I'll order lunch.

963
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,320
Please, as soon as you can.

964
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,880
- Tell me why I can't
come and live with you.

965
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,260
- Did you come all the way
here on your skateboard?

966
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,570
Do you realize you could've gotten hurt?

967
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,140
That was really dumb, Joshua.

968
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:23,170
I'm sorry, hey come on, sit down.

969
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,690
Do you want anything?

970
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,520
You know, I miss you too.

971
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,660
- Why can't I come and live with you?

972
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,830
- Because you don't belong to me.

973
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,180
- I don't belong to anyone.

974
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,110
- [Claudia] Josh, Josh,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

975
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,010
That was a stupid think for me to say.

976
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,550
- Don't you think we had
a lot of fun together?

977
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:52,520
- Yeah, the most, come here.

978
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,770
Now, I know that you're unhappy,

979
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,500
but your father loves you.

980
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,070
- Not as much as you.

981
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,290
- But we're not related.

982
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,220
They have laws about these things.

983
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,220
- The laws are dumb.

984
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,880
- Well, we'll see what we can do, okay?

985
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:13,220
But in the meantime,
we've gotta get you home.

986
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,303
Now, come on.

987
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:32,810
- Hi Josh, how you doing?

988
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:34,778
- Hi.

989
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,500
- Make sure and water the plants, okay.

990
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,350
Especially now that it's getting hot.

991
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,020
- Thanks for bringing me home, Claude.

992
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:49,903
See ya.

993
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:51,903
- You bet.

994
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,750
- So, did they tell you
it wasn't your fault?

995
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:04,788
- Yeah.

996
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,240
- Divorce, it makes you
have to be more grown up,

997
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,630
but still it's better
to live with your dad,

998
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,580
because you don't have
to do all that man stuff.

999
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:21,080
You know, like take out the
garbage and carry the suitcases.

1000
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:27,460
- Yeah, but I wish I had a
brother or a sister to talk to.

1001
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,360
- Hey, me too,

1002
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,830
but at least you got
Chuck and a video camera,

1003
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,290
and you don't have to take piano lessons.

1004
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,380
- Yeah, so did you know
anyone who was adopted?

1005
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,967
- Uh, I knew this kid Ethan.

1006
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:45,760
He had a pretty good deal.

1007
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,140
They act a lot more scared
of you when your adopted.

1008
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,980
- Hello, I wanna talk to
somebody about getting adopted.

1009
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,690
- Now look, Mrs. Kent,

1010
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,160
I just wanna find out
what is going on here.

1011
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,500
- As I tried to explain on the phone

1012
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,680
it's my job to investigate
whenever there's probable cause.

1013
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,513
- Of what?

1014
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,630
- Joshua told us that you're never home.

1015
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,180
That you leave him alone a lot.

1016
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:34,330
- He is a kid, he was exaggerating.

1017
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,120
Now, do I look like the kind of a man

1018
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,200
who would leave a 10 year
old child at home alone?

1019
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,580
- Abuse and neglect exists
in all sorts of homes,

1020
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,680
all kinds of families.

1021
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,620
- You get the hell outta my house.

1022
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,630
Nobody comes in here and
accuses me of child abuse.

1023
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,463
Now get out!

1024
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,430
- I came here simply to
interview you and Joshua.

1025
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,170
If you insist on my leaving

1026
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,870
I'll be forced to get a court order.

1027
01:01:07,354 --> 01:01:12,354
- Okay, okay, you just do your thing.

1028
01:01:12,704 --> 01:01:16,460
I'll uh find him, he said
he'd be right around here.

1029
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,020
Josh, Josh!

1030
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:34,670
He's right down there on the beach.

1031
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,450
- Well then, I think I'll go
down there and talk with him.

1032
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,283
- Be my guest.

1033
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,500
- They didn't fight or anything.

1034
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:53,037
My friend Rafe said that his parents

1035
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:54,787
were screaming and hit one another.

1036
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,620
My dad took me on this camping trip,

1037
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:02,190
and there was this other
woman there named Susan.

1038
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,740
I just couldn't understand
why my mom wasn't along.

1039
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,540
My dad wasn't too good
at explaining things.

1040
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,560
You know, he still isn't.

1041
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,090
We had a big, white porch,

1042
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,820
and one day when I came
home from my camping trip

1043
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,160
my mom was in the rocking chair crying.

1044
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,720
She told me she was leaving.

1045
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,430
- Do you remember how you felt?

1046
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,040
- I asked her if she could
stay for my birthday.

1047
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,873
She said no.

1048
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:46,320
- Do you and your dad do
lots of things together?

1049
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,480
- Well, he's pretty busy.

1050
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,830
You know, he travels a lot,

1051
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,320
but he takes me great places

1052
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,590
for trips and on the weekends and stuff.

1053
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:56,120
- Like where?

1054
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,290
- Fishing in Alaska.

1055
01:02:58,606 --> 01:03:00,030
He took me snorkeling in Hawaii

1056
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,930
and there was all these eels and fish.

1057
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,450
Pretty neat because you
could almost pet the fish,

1058
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:09,180
but they swam away just
before you could get to them.

1059
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,610
So, how do you decide who gets adopted?

1060
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,550
- Tell me about your friend Claudia.

1061
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:23,440
- Well, she taught me
about plants and stuff.

1062
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,300
I know when people are
pretending to like me,

1063
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,230
but she really likes being with me.

1064
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:33,640
We don't do anything
special except drive around,

1065
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,790
go to the grocery shop.

1066
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,030
She never looks at her
watch when she's with me.

1067
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:44,290
She always asked me what I'm
thinking about and how I feel.

1068
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,620
She really wants to know.

1069
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,240
- You must miss her.

1070
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:55,090
- Feels bad all the time in here.

1071
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,550
- Some peoples hearts
are all dried up, Joshua.

1072
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,670
You can hear them rattling around inside.

1073
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:08,690
It won't hurt forever,

1074
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,760
and it's good to know you've got one.

1075
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:22,040
- You are not going to
allow a 10 year old child

1076
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,950
to decided what is best
for himself now, are you?

1077
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:28,270
- The departments evaluation
will be based on my interviews

1078
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,820
with all the parties concerned.

1079
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:34,260
Joshua is a thoughtful, sensitive boy,

1080
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,130
and I'm sure you're to be
congratulated for that.

1081
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:40,110
I know that it is not easy
to raise a child alone.

1082
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,220
Especially when you have
a busy work schedule

1083
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,440
and you travel a lot.

1084
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,400
- You know, I'm not so sure

1085
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,880
that I'm concerned about
the counties evaluation

1086
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,820
of my parenting skills.

1087
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,630
Now, do you mind telling me
what are your credentials?

1088
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,830
What qualifies you to judge me?

1089
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,850
- I'm a licensed psychiatric social worker

1090
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,270
with 20 years experience
in child placement.

1091
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:07,850
- I may not be the most uh,
sensitive man in the world,

1092
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:13,180
but his own mother walked out on him,

1093
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,420
and I love that boy and
I won't give him up.

1094
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:34,218
(light piano music)

1095
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,230
- Hi Claude, it's me.

1096
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,020
I'm okay, Chuck's fine.

1097
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,800
Mrs. Kent acted like maybe I
can come and live with you.

1098
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,030
Well, she didn't say no.

1099
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,270
And every Christmas we can go to the farm,

1100
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:57,420
and I can make a video.

1101
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,990
Yeah okay, I got a new idea
for a story we could work on.

1102
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:06,630
It's about a screwed up family,

1103
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,260
but the cool part about
it, it's a family of sheep.

1104
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,340
- You want another uh, milkshake?

1105
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,053
- No.

1106
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:19,900
- More fries?

1107
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,910
- You already asked me
that three times, Dad.

1108
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,400
What is it, why are you acting so weird.

1109
01:06:27,252 --> 01:06:28,652
- I wanna ask you something.

1110
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,580
Was it your idea to call up the county

1111
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,830
and ask to be adopted?

1112
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,133
- Yeah.

1113
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:42,880
- You sure nobody suggested it to you?

1114
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,510
- No, Dad, like who?

1115
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:49,740
- Like, I don't know.

1116
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,990
Why did you do it, sport?

1117
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,980
- 'Cause I wanna live with Claude.

1118
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:03,180
- Well, you just can't do that.

1119
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,873
- [Joshua] Why not?

1120
01:07:04,873 --> 01:07:09,690
- Because, hey look, I may
not be some TV show dad,

1121
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,730
but I'm the only one you got,

1122
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,570
and we were doing okay,

1123
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:20,650
and I know you want a
mom and a regular family,

1124
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,740
and I'm sorry that it
didn't work out with Claude.

1125
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,310
- It didn't work out with any of them.

1126
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,510
You don't want it to work out.

1127
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:33,120
Even Mom, you didn't like so much.

1128
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,440
I like having someone to
talk to besides Chuck.

1129
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,590
- You can talk to me, sport.

1130
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,069
- You're never around.

1131
01:07:43,069 --> 01:07:45,870
When you are you're not really there.

1132
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,830
- I was there when you were born.

1133
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,320
I've always been there for you,

1134
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,120
and, and when you go to
college, when you get married,

1135
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,620
I will still be there for you.

1136
01:07:57,357 --> 01:07:59,080
- You could have all your Sunday's free.

1137
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,410
- I don't want all my Sunday's free, Josh.

1138
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,593
I mean, it's just now,

1139
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:05,910
you got these bureaucratic dogs,

1140
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:06,743
they're on my back,

1141
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:08,960
and I gotta prove I'm
not some kind of creep.

1142
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,110
- I never told them you were a creep, Dad.

1143
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,830
I just said I wanna live with Claude.

1144
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,990
- I can't believe Tom would neglect Josh.

1145
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,760
I mean, he'd be more likely to spoil him.

1146
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:32,910
Buy him too much stuff.

1147
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,473
- But you haven't lived

1148
01:08:35,473 --> 01:08:38,340
with either one of them
for over five years.

1149
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:41,090
- I've been planning to move
down here since last winter.

1150
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,030
I was only 18 when I had Josh.

1151
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,410
I couldn't take care of
myself, let alone him.

1152
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:55,480
Well, I tried to five years,
but I wasn't a whole person.

1153
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,810
I was just Tom's shadow.

1154
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,140
He was so much older, I was
sure he'd be the better parent.

1155
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:07,290
He's done a great job,

1156
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,820
even though he's shuffled a lot of women

1157
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,120
in and out of Josh's life.

1158
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,290
I made a lot of mistakes,

1159
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,100
but I want a shot at being his mother.

1160
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,160
Don't you think I deserve a second chance?

1161
01:09:34,115 --> 01:09:35,850
- Did Joshua's relationship with Claudia

1162
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,340
have anything to do with your decision?

1163
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,328
- No, I decided to try and do this

1164
01:09:41,328 --> 01:09:46,328
before I ever knew about her, I swear.

1165
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:53,300
- I have a really good
job, and I could move.

1166
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,200
I could afford a small
house with a backyard,

1167
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,033
if that's a problem,

1168
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,680
because I know he would
wanna bring the dog in.

1169
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,330
- Please, calm down, Miss Casara.

1170
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,630
- I'm sorry, it's just that um,

1171
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:08,160
I've been a little nervous lately.

1172
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,200
I just miss Joshua so much.

1173
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,640
Tom won't let me see him at all anymore.

1174
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,130
You know, he actually accused me

1175
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,700
of trying to get back at him

1176
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,890
by making Josh call you
people about being adopted.

1177
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,870
- Why do you think you and
Josh connected so much?

1178
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,244
- Well, I think because I'm the first

1179
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:33,850
motherly type girlfriend
that Tom ever had.

1180
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,470
He's dated tons of women,

1181
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,020
but not one of them could've
cared less about Josh.

1182
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,730
- You think Josh was unhappy at home?

1183
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,510
- No, not entirely,

1184
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,820
but I do think that he's a lot needier

1185
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,930
than Tom thinks he is.

1186
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:51,400
I think that he denies the fact

1187
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,360
that Josh might have emotional problems.

1188
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,190
I mean, he just sort
of says thing like um,

1189
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:58,610
oh, he's a tough little guy,

1190
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:01,030
or he's resilient, he'll surprise you.

1191
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,330
- Did you ever see Tom
hurt Joshua in any way?

1192
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,820
Hit him or verbally abuse him?

1193
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,820
- No, absolutely not.

1194
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,410
- Did he ever leave him alone in the house

1195
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,270
for long periods of time?

1196
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,770
- No, not even for short periods of time.

1197
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,730
There was always some sort of housekeeper

1198
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:22,360
or babysitter there.

1199
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,360
Look um, I would love to be with Joshua

1200
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,700
more than anything in the world,

1201
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:34,280
and I think that I would
be a good mother for him,

1202
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,870
but I can't tell you that Tom
is some kind of a monster.

1203
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,340
I mean, he's not the most
sensitive guy in the world,

1204
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,040
but he's no worse than
most of the men I've known.

1205
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:51,400
He's busy, distracted,
enormously self-centered,

1206
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,170
but I don't think that he would ever

1207
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,810
hurt Joshua intentionally.

1208
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:59,930
- Well, I appreciate your honesty.

1209
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:05,600
Joshua has told me that you've
shown tremendous respect

1210
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,110
for his thoughts and feelings

1211
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:09,630
in a way that no one else has before.

1212
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,100
He feels very loved by you,

1213
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,090
but these are very confusing
times, Miss Casara.

1214
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,940
Family relationships are
a lot more complicated

1215
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,000
than they used to be,

1216
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,700
especially for a little boy of 10.

1217
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,950
Children need categories.

1218
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,840
That's how they understand the world,

1219
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:35,200
and Joshua can not fit
you into any category.

1220
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,670
He can't call you mother,
or step-mother, or aunt.

1221
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,413
Miss Casara.

1222
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:48,310
- Well, Josh doesn't
call Kit mother either.

1223
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:53,310
- I know, but he used to,
and in time he may again.

1224
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,030
- But Josh and I need each other.

1225
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:02,850
- I feel for what you're going
through now, I really do,

1226
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:06,580
and uh, strictly off the record,

1227
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,850
you could seek legal council.

1228
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,250
You might be able to make
a case for visitation,

1229
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:13,720
but do think about it.

1230
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,349
I know you care a great deal about Joshua,

1231
01:13:17,349 --> 01:13:19,750
and you want what's best for him.

1232
01:13:26,058 --> 01:13:27,920
- Now, I gotta go to camp.

1233
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:37,050
Don't worry, boy, you
know I always come back.

1234
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,150
Come on, Chuckles, come on buddy.

1235
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,620
- It's only gonna be
three weeks, you know,

1236
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,640
and at the end of it

1237
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,380
you probably won't even wanna come home.

1238
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,090
Come on, come on, Chuckles.

1239
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:02,950
- [Joshua] Come on, Chuckles.

1240
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:05,950
(light piano music)

1241
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,163
- [Josh Voiceover] Dear Claude.

1242
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,500
They made me draw this dumb self-portrait

1243
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,346
in arts and crafts.

1244
01:15:39,346 --> 01:15:41,700
I really hate this camp, it's so dorky.

1245
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:45,080
I bet Dad forgot to water the garden.

1246
01:15:47,117 --> 01:15:49,720
Do they let dogs live in your building?

1247
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,370
I miss Chuck and Rafe.

1248
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:52,790
Whenever I miss you,

1249
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:55,290
I just have to look in my
heart and there you are.

1250
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:57,523
Love, Josh.

1251
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:02,971
(light piano music)

1252
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,390
- This is a wonderful story,
darling, and very touching.

1253
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,960
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

1254
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,914
I think any publisher
would be lucky to get it.

1255
01:16:38,914 --> 01:16:40,820
- [Claudia] Thanks, Mom.

1256
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,610
- And some man will be lucky to get you.

1257
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:44,940
- Mm, I don't want one.

1258
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:48,900
- You will, and maybe next time

1259
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,490
you'll be more careful
about who you choose.

1260
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:53,330
- I'll never pick another Tom.

1261
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,000
- Should I tell you about
the man I almost married?

1262
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,880
His name was Jack and he was charming.

1263
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,040
Mama and Poppy didn't approve.

1264
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,210
He wasn't Catholic and he wasn't Italian,

1265
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:18,060
which is probably why
I was wild about him.

1266
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:23,540
He was a dreamer and he could
play the piano beautifully,

1267
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,770
and then I met your father,

1268
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,880
and from that first day

1269
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,720
he charged ahead with a
plan for our lives together.

1270
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,660
He was hard to resist,

1271
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:42,520
and I made the right decision.

1272
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:48,020
Choose the one who will
sit up with you at 3 a.m.

1273
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,370
when your baby has a fever.

1274
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:53,380
- Where did you get all
your certainty from?

1275
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:56,640
- I never had to worry about
making a way for myself,

1276
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,590
or having a career or
living in a city alone.

1277
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:04,384
Do you know I have never
even called a lawyer?

1278
01:18:04,384 --> 01:18:06,650
- Hmm, I talked to mine again

1279
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,750
after I got the letter
from the department.

1280
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,470
He thinks it's a longshot to
try and appeal the decision,

1281
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,800
but I don't know, I really.

1282
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,180
- Want what's best for Joshua.

1283
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:23,860
- Oh Mom, I wish you'd
gotten to know him better.

1284
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:25,930
- I could see he was a lovely boy.

1285
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,700
- There's so much of him in my book.

1286
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,480
I mean, you have no idea
how extraordinary he is.

1287
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:37,730
He showed me the kind of
person that I need to be with.

1288
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,817
I found out what it's
like to be with someone

1289
01:18:39,817 --> 01:18:42,550
who really cares about you,

1290
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,240
who cares about what you're thinking.

1291
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,750
- Claudia, listen to yourself.

1292
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,710
He's a 10 year old boy.

1293
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,620
- I know, I know it sounds crazy.

1294
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,510
I just miss him so much.

1295
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:04,380
I finally found someone who
really needed me, a need in me,

1296
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:09,040
and I just don't think
that I can give that up.

1297
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:13,300
- You have to, you have no other choice.

1298
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:16,120
Kit deserves a chance.

1299
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,060
She's his mother.

1300
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,810
It'll be all right, darling.

1301
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:23,650
You'll have children of your own.

1302
01:19:46,469 --> 01:19:49,386
(knocking on door)

1303
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:55,340
- Hi, Claudia, I'm Kit.

1304
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,940
- Hi.

1305
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,500
- Thanks for coming.

1306
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,170
I really appreciate it.

1307
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,003
Come on in.

1308
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,480
Did you have any trouble finding it?

1309
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,040
I'm not too good with directions.

1310
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,850
- No, I know Venice pretty well.

1311
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,490
I lived nearby when I first moved here.

1312
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:18,850
- The neighborhood's pretty weird,

1313
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:21,300
but at least I can afford it.

1314
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,260
I won't be making too much at my new job.

1315
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,710
- What're you gonna be doing?

1316
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:31,580
- Uh, I'll be working at the um,

1317
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,490
music center in the box office.

1318
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:36,430
I start next week.

1319
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:42,580
That's as close to the
ballet as I could get.

1320
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,210
You wanna see Josh's room?

1321
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,340
He hasn't stayed here yet,

1322
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:54,110
but pretty soon he'll be
coming every other weekend.

1323
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:58,130
I uh, tried to fix it
up in a way he'd like.

1324
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:03,470
- I'm sure it's fine,
but maybe we should just.

1325
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,090
- You know what he likes.

1326
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:11,420
- All right, I'd be happy to see it.

1327
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,820
- I know Josh loves you.

1328
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,530
He hates me, there's just--

1329
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:28,530
- Please, don't, he doesn't hate you.

1330
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,270
He just doesn't know you very well,

1331
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,030
and he's probably a lot
different than you remember too.

1332
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:37,540
You know, he's almost a teenager now.

1333
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,940
- I bet the smell of cheese
still makes him sick.

1334
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,250
- He'll come around.

1335
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,050
You just have to give him some time.

1336
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:47,529
- Will you give us time?

1337
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:51,560
- What do you mean?

1338
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:58,230
- I don't stand a chance
with Josh if you're around.

1339
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,920
I've been a failure at
everything I've tried to do.

1340
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,020
I couldn't make it as a dancer.

1341
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,330
I couldn't make it as a wife.

1342
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,820
Let me try and be a good mother.

1343
01:22:27,328 --> 01:22:28,713
(both laughing)

1344
01:22:28,713 --> 01:22:29,812
- You're fabulous.

1345
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:30,730
- Oh, thank you.

1346
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,360
- Hey dude, hit me.

1347
01:22:38,255 --> 01:22:42,180
You know, you got a birthday coming up.

1348
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,200
Maybe we oughta figure
out what you wanna do.

1349
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:50,760
- I wanna go out to dinner,
same as always, but with Claude.

1350
01:22:58,295 --> 01:23:00,710
- Maybe you oughta think about
spending the day with Kit.

1351
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:03,560
- Mrs. Kent said I'm allowed
to see Claude one more time,

1352
01:23:04,407 --> 01:23:06,157
and I want it to be on my birthday.

1353
01:23:22,646 --> 01:23:24,720
- What about the bathing beauty layout?

1354
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,710
- I don't know.

1355
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,110
- Okay, what's the problem?

1356
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,470
Is the new girlfriend going to be there?

1357
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:38,520
- Oh God, I hope not.

1358
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,360
No, it's just that I have so many things

1359
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,030
that I wanna say to Josh.

1360
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,630
About how much he means to me,

1361
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,910
and how much I learned
about myself from him,

1362
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:54,370
and it's just so hard.

1363
01:23:56,225 --> 01:23:57,058
I can't believe this is how

1364
01:23:57,058 --> 01:23:58,770
we have to spend our last time together.

1365
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,800
- I just you would've told him

1366
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,130
it was too upsetting for you to come.

1367
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:02,680
- No, it's too important to him.

1368
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,770
He picked this event.

1369
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:06,370
- I know, but your torturing
yourself, it's torture.

1370
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,170
As much as you miss Josh,

1371
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:14,390
it's being in that
instant fake family again,

1372
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:15,223
that's killing you.

1373
01:24:15,223 --> 01:24:18,100
With the dad and the kid
and the you playing the mom.

1374
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,090
It's like, it's like a slap in the face,

1375
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,250
and honey, you have got to let go.

1376
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,230
- I really thought I had.

1377
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:37,730
You know, when I went and saw Kit,

1378
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,830
and she was trying to fix
up that little apartment,

1379
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,690
I realized that motherhood
is more than just attachment.

1380
01:25:28,705 --> 01:25:30,620
- What do you say, sport, lobster?

1381
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,453
- Yeah.

1382
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:49,743
- Hi.

1383
01:25:49,743 --> 01:25:50,576
- Hi.

1384
01:25:50,576 --> 01:25:52,240
- I didn't think you'd come.

1385
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,540
- I wouldn't miss your
birthday for the world.

1386
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,340
I love the card that
you sent me from camp.

1387
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,340
I'm gonna keep that forever.

1388
01:26:15,873 --> 01:26:17,390
- And there's this real dorky kid.

1389
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:19,760
I mean, he was swimming and
he really couldn't swim.

1390
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,190
I had to hold onto his hair
until the counselor came.

1391
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,570
- Well, good for you.

1392
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:27,410
- So, how's your book doing, Claude?

1393
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:30,791
- Well, I sent it to a couple
of publishers in Boston,

1394
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:33,541
and hopefully they're gonna
let me know something soon.

1395
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:39,830
Oh, and I changed Andy's name to Joshua.

1396
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:45,060
- Really, you did?

1397
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,719
(light piano music)

1398
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:56,810
- All right (laughs).

1399
01:26:58,971 --> 01:26:59,920
Did you make a wish?

1400
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:01,950
- Yeah Dad, I did.

1401
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:10,590
- Well, we thought maybe we'd
check it out, just this year.

1402
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:14,693
(light piano music)

1403
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:39,300
Josh, maybe you oughta give Kit a break.

1404
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,080
It's only every other weekend.

1405
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:49,340
So, don't make her work so hard, okay,

1406
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:55,390
and try to deal with all
that emotional stuff.

1407
01:27:57,896 --> 01:27:59,550
You don't wanna end up like your old man.

1408
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:04,723
- I'll try, Dad.

1409
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:07,723
- Okay, sport.

1410
01:28:15,818 --> 01:28:18,342
- Come on Chuck, come on, good boy.

1411
01:28:18,342 --> 01:28:21,092
(Chuckles barks)

1412
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,670
Ooh Chuckles, your favorite.

1413
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:40,204
Just like the ones on the beach, yeah.

1414
01:28:40,204 --> 01:28:41,920
- All right, look what I've got.

1415
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,060
- Oh great.

1416
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,220
- Yeah, they almost done?

1417
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:47,040
- Yep, I cooked the
first one for Chuckles.

1418
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,180
- For Chuckles?

1419
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:49,013
- Yeah.

1420
01:28:49,013 --> 01:28:50,390
- [Kit] All right, well,
I'll get you a bun.

1421
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,223
- [Joshua] Okay.

1422
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:58,690
- Okay, all right, there you go.

1423
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:01,410
- Mm Chuckles, your favorite, yeah.

1424
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,030
- He does like it.

1425
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,863
- Yep.

1426
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,820
- Surprise.

1427
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:08,653
- Ooh.

1428
01:29:11,651 --> 01:29:12,850
- I can't believe it.

1429
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:13,900
- How about changes?

1430
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,390
- Nope, all they want me to do

1431
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,135
is work on the title and the cover.

1432
01:29:17,135 --> 01:29:18,343
(Nick exhales deeply)

1433
01:29:18,343 --> 01:29:20,626
(upbeat jazz music)

1434
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:22,088
- Congratulations, hon.

1435
01:29:22,088 --> 01:29:23,921
- [Claudia] Thank you.

1436
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:31,048
(Claudia gasps)

1437
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:39,051
(both laughing)

1438
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,323
- Kit.

1439
01:29:59,248 --> 01:30:00,081
- Are you okay?

1440
01:30:02,878 --> 01:30:04,910
- I can't sleep, it's too hot.

1441
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,000
- Me neither, what should we do?

1442
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:14,020
- I don't know.

1443
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:18,710
Well, my school's having a
Halloween Ball this year,

1444
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,135
and I only know how to do-si-do.

1445
01:30:21,135 --> 01:30:23,500
Do you think you could
teach me how to slow dance?

1446
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,593
- Sure.

1447
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:37,760
Okay, you ready?

1448
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:41,360
Put your hand here, right here.

1449
01:30:43,656 --> 01:30:45,200
Ready, we're gonna make a box.

1450
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,787
One, two, three.

1451
01:30:46,787 --> 01:30:48,455
One, two, three.

1452
01:30:48,455 --> 01:30:50,039
One, two, three.

1453
01:30:50,039 --> 01:30:51,948
Good, one, two, three.

1454
01:30:51,948 --> 01:30:53,292
One, two, three.

1455
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:56,823
That's good, good.

1456
01:30:56,823 --> 01:30:58,870
Look up, look up.

1457
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,200
- Come on, oh no.

1458
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,310
- [Kit] Go faster.

1459
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:04,841
- [Joshua] Oh no.

1460
01:31:04,841 --> 01:31:06,541
- (laughs) No, try again, come on.

1461
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,360
All right, one, two, three.

1462
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,210
One, two, three.

1463
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:15,650
Good, good, gotta look up.

1464
01:31:17,469 --> 01:31:18,620
Don't you wanna see who
you're dancing with?

1465
01:31:19,698 --> 01:31:20,876
Wanna go faster?

1466
01:31:20,876 --> 01:31:21,772
- [Joshua] Okay.

1467
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:22,870
- A little faster.

1468
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,730
Ready, now make a square.

1469
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:28,222
(Kit laughing)

1470
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:33,040
- Tell me a joke, you
don't know any jokes?

1471
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:33,873
- Nah.

1472
01:31:33,873 --> 01:31:35,510
- Nah, don't you hear them in school?

1473
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,233
- [Joshua] No.

1474
01:31:37,233 --> 01:31:38,066
- [Kit] Hey look, Josh.

1475
01:31:38,066 --> 01:31:38,970
- [Joshua] Oh neat.

1476
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:40,720
- We could hang these.

1477
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,090
Who does that remind you of?

1478
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:42,931
- [Joshua] You.

1479
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:44,638
- [Kit] Yeah (laughs).

1480
01:31:44,638 --> 01:31:46,088
Some of these are great.

1481
01:31:46,088 --> 01:31:46,921
- Yeah.

1482
01:32:00,953 --> 01:32:03,953
(light piano music)

1483
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,597
Can I go in, Mom?

1484
01:32:21,798 --> 01:32:22,631
- Yeah.

1485
01:32:28,466 --> 01:32:29,466
- Thank you.

1486
01:32:37,311 --> 01:32:39,267
- There you go.

1487
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:42,267
(light piano music)

1488
01:32:49,213 --> 01:32:52,650
Here you go.

1489
01:32:53,830 --> 01:32:54,730
Hi, how are you?

1490
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:55,624
- Hi, how are you?

1491
01:32:55,624 --> 01:32:57,320
(Claudia giggles)

1492
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,560
- You first.

1493
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,580
- I'm doing pretty good, Claude.

1494
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,320
- Good, me too, how's Chuck?

1495
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,970
- Oh, he's great, he just
got his teeth cleaned.

1496
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:07,850
- Good, and how's Rafe?

1497
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:10,560
- Well, his parents are
trying to get back together,

1498
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,260
so he's moving back to New York,

1499
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:15,400
but I get to spend
Thanksgiving vacation with him.

1500
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,820
- [Claudia] Oh, that sounds like fun.

1501
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:17,653
- Yeah.

1502
01:33:17,653 --> 01:33:22,640
- You know, I almost called
you to tell you about the book.

1503
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:26,909
I even thought about trying
to see you one last time.

1504
01:33:26,909 --> 01:33:28,289
- It's okay, Claude,

1505
01:33:28,289 --> 01:33:32,113
I'm just glad we were
walking by and I saw you.

1506
01:33:32,113 --> 01:33:33,170
- Me too.

1507
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:34,807
- Now your book came out.

1508
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:36,724
- Mm mm, it's our book.

1509
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:43,492
This is for you.

1510
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,038
(light piano music)

1511
01:34:10,157 --> 01:34:13,157
(light piano music)

1512
01:35:11,437 --> 01:35:14,270
