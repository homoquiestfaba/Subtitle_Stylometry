1
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,211
Where are we?

2
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,479
I don't know

3
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,107
Can't see anything.

4
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,879
Radio doesn't either work.

5
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,582
I said it looks familiar but, I...

6
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,525
I never been inside the cloud before.

7
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,795
What's the last sight you saw?

8
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,054
Same was what I didn't see it.

9
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,758
Spend like this all night,
as long freaking fog vague in history.

10
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,595
It's kinda that long

11
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,999
Moving past than we are...
what are you doing like? Two?

12
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,542
You know, I have listened to
you snored for like an hour.

13
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,381
Now, you give me grieve.
You wanna drive?

14
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,540
No, no, no...

15
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,980
Believe me,
if there'd a crippled old lady

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,247
passed in
her son's handicapped scooter,

17
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:14,960
when you ride with her...
I bet she must go faster than us.

18
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,923
Jesus Christ!!!!

19
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,796
Shit!

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,092
Holy shit!

21
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,066
That is not a way the fog to leave.

22
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,296
He could kill somebody.

23
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,100
I think we are up on the sidewalk.

24
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,679
Oh, man.

25
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,711
Oh, crap.

26
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,984
You get out, give it some push.

27
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,853
I can't see anything.

28
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,685
Welcome to my world.

29
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,187
There is somebody out there.

30
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,655
Then ask direction. Jesus Christ!

31
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,959
Gibbs, you're like a little girl.
C'mon!

32
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,295
You're like a girl

33
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,234
God damn it.

34
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,340
Push.

35
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,777
Push.

36
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,883
Ok! Try to get the other way!

37
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:33,303
Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hey!

38
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,640
That was fucked up!

39
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,270
Hooke, what are you doing?

40
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,872
They are going somewhere.
I wanna find out where we are.

41
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:50,380
Wait, Hold up! You know what,
I will grab the bags. Hooke!

42
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,450
Hey, you ever see the movie while
pirates traveling around in the fog?

43
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,120
Can't believe you watch that crap.

44
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,993
It was the mother fucked protect you up!

45
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,824
It is shit.

46
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,629
There're zombies with swords!

47
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,933
They jump out the fog
and they stab on your face and they...

48
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,405
And the parrot goes through your eyes,

49
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,942
and is like David Jones'
lock in the puzzle.

50
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,137
Oh! It's amazing.

51
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,945
It's like cinema. You know,
just moves you. God, it's great!

52
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,112
That's your education really paid off.

53
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,086
Your parent muse be
very proud of you. Gibbs.

54
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,247
It's really good movie.

55
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,189
Sure.

56
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,559
Zombies with swords.

57
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,456
Ten for it.

58
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,096
What do you think?

59
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,395
I don't know.
Something doesn't feel right.

60
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,299
But I don't think we have a choice.

61
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,840
Well you know, beast would shit out
and wander around in the fog.

62
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,737
All right, let's give it a shot!

63
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,011
We were crashed to the far clears!

64
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,981
I don't think we could
find a wine and the soup.

65
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,055
But if it's a hot little maid,
Gibbs calls dips.

66
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:16,100
Yeah! Ok, this is uh...
I don't really know what it is.

67
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,870
Just glad I'm not an animal.

68
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,772
What the hell is this place!

69
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:21,909
Mercy.

70
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,319
This town.

71
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:29,755
Mercy.

72
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,424
Well, we didn't see any sign so...

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,961
We...have a game tomorrow,
we're playing a festival.

74
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,195
Yap, if we could get out of this fog.

75
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,536
Oh, yeah! The fog.

76
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,899
I take the chance.

77
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,873
Feels one room for the night.

78
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,840
Rooms. Rooms if you have any.

79
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,315
Sure. We just happened to
have couple of rooms.

80
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,677
Ya, it's a shock.

81
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,980
If you sign the book.

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,589
Here you go. Boys! Eleven, twelve.

83
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,928
Excuse me.
I need you both to sign the book.

84
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,297
Okay.

85
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,435
Let me give you a credit card for this.

86
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,806
That's all right.
We will take care that charge later.

87
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,412
Okay

88
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,583
Uh, is it too late to get something eat?

89
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,948
Yeah.

90
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,516
Sorry.

91
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,126
I wasn't hungry anyway.

92
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,473
Hey, that fucker looks like in the fog.

93
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,676
It's gotta cute.

94
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,080
Let's go, brother.

95
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,621
Yap, your eleven.

96
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,361
Hooke.

97
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,163
Ok. We need it some locked.

98
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,485
Man. You are pathetic.

99
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,219
What! It's wide open.
Anybody could be hidding in here.

100
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,857
Gibbs, you get a room with a view.

101
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:54,996
Sweet.

102
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,905
Maybe you could call out
for that hot little maid.

103
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,740
Hey, Hooke.

104
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,476
You want me to go with you?

105
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:06,910
Check your room out.

106
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,610
If I see anything spooky, I'll scream.

107
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,576
It's night light there, if you need it.

108
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,383
Good night, buddy.

109
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,130
Sure, you got that secured room.

110
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,478
It's very funny, man.

111
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,873
Really mature.

112
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,744
That's classic.

113
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,621
Do I know you?

114
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,895
Remember me.
I know you?

115
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:47,907
What?

116
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,880
It's me. You told me
to wake you up at six am.

117
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,913
Hold on.

118
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,289
Good morning.

119
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,058
Morning

120
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,401
Look like you are in the fog.
I got it 'cause...

121
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,402
I just had a crazy dream, Man.

122
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,508
You know, the fog bullshit is back,
so I'm not going anywhere with that.

123
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,740
Well, it will be like soon so...

124
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,479
Let's go. Let's burn off.

125
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,550
Whatever.

126
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,618
You know, why don't we...

127
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,524
uh get a bit to eat
before you get it lost again.

128
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,521
No, no way. I don't want to be late.

129
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,825
C'mon.

130
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,328
All that costs to the room.

131
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,937
All right.

132
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,801
Let's go. Make it quick, all right.

133
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,622
This room can use that
miracle home makeover, dude.

134
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,420
Gibbs, check it out.

135
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,053
Nice.

136
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,528
They haven't used it in years.

137
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,091
Maybe they should, get little cold.

138
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,472
I guess we sit.

139
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,409
That was not set.

140
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,957
That was weird.
A little weird.

141
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,363
What's up the kids
cleaning this dinning room.

142
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,672
You don't want to have
whatever tasted dusty for the breakfast.

143
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,667
Dinner.

144
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,476
You said breakfast.

145
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,908
Yeah, that's sort of way me
and my friend like to do it.

146
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,778
We like it save dinner
till the end of the day.

147
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,840
It is the end.

148
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,180
What!

149
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,586
It's six fifteen, in the evening.

150
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:46,858
There is no way.

151
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,227
We..we just checked in last night.

152
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,623
That must be late last night.

153
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,522
Or early in the morning?

154
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,197
No, no, no, no...

155
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,666
There is no way
we slept for twenty four hours.

156
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,292
Man, we miss our geek!

157
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,897
He must need it a rest.
I'm Peter Rose. This is my wife, Diane.

158
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,577
Mike Gibbs.

159
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:06,845
John Hooke.

160
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,842
Hey...There's a Hook
in the Ohio. H-o-o-k

161
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,643
Na, I don't think so.

162
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,616
That's an E
in the end of mine, H-o-o-k-e.

163
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,990
Hey, let's get out here.
Let's grasp some to eat on the road.

164
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,952
What's the rush?

165
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,927
We already blow it.
We might as well stay for a dinner.

166
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,861
That's some fog out there, huh?

167
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,298
I like the fog.

168
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,537
Just looks like it's day
down at any time soon neither.

169
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,804
But, we don't mind.

170
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,470
Our first vacation in the years.

171
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,205
My boss just has to get by
without me for a day or two.

172
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,408
That's ok with me.

173
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,211
She reminds me of somebody.

174
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,484
Whatever.

175
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,551
So, how about you?

176
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,760
You here on business or pleasure, huh?

177
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,691
I'm just passing through.

178
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,956
Oh... really?

179
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,967
And for us.
We got here this afternoon, I guess.

180
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,072
Oh, thank goodness we found this place.
It's crazy out there.

181
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,139
Couldn't see a damn thing in the fog!

182
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,875
Haha...Yeah, too bad.

183
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,377
Good evening, everyone.

184
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,646
I think Benedict cooked himself tonight.

185
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,319
This looks so delicious.

186
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,922
Oh yeah.

187
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,984
I have got the wine.

188
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,395
Wine.

189
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,398
Fill it up on top, Mark.
He is such cheap with wine.

190
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,730
I haven't had brussels sprouts in years.

191
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,637
He loves brussels sprouts.

192
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,398
Don't we all?

193
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,505
Excuse me, is there anyway
I can take a look at menu?

194
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,781
Sorry, we are working on it,
but tonight this is the menu.

195
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,522
Great. Thanks.

196
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,994
Well, enjoy your dinner.

197
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,563
What's wrong?

198
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,927
I don't like raw meat.

199
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,533
Mean I can eat this?

200
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,739
All right.

201
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,847
Is there anybody know there is
a coffee shop around here or anywhere?

202
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,819
Is it the best food
that you've ever eaten in your life?

203
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,743
My God! I'm stuffed.

204
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,739
Can I get a coffee, please?

205
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:57,677
Coffee?

206
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,177
You don't want to
have a coffee after all that food.

207
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:02,443
Actually, I...

208
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,317
We don't have coffee!

209
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,196
Looks like they lick the plates clean.

210
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,257
As usual.

211
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,163
I'm so bored.

212
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,971
I know, baby.

213
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,608
He asked for coffee.

214
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,486
If we are stuck here for one night?

215
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,658
Fucked that! Let's go.

216
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,817
What about the fog?

217
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,388
I will give it a shit!
We'll find a way out of here. Let's go!

218
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,563
Listen, when you get back to the city,
you should ...should call me, okay?

219
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:56,471
21349555..you can email me, totally!

220
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,246
What about the bill?

221
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,977
We send him a check.

222
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,711
Did I give you the keys?

223
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,020
Shit!

224
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,654
Here we go! Here we go!

225
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,262
Keys! keys!

226
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,760
Gibbs, you don't have them?

227
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,535
Gibbs, you don't have them?

228
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,171
No! You were driving!

229
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,099
I must have left them in the car.

230
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,502
All right, I am gonna look.

231
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,074
Okay. Keep me informed.

232
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,528
shit!

233
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,112
He asked for coffee.
Why did he ask for a coffee?

234
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,674
Did he eat his meal?

235
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,315
Every bit.

236
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,376
And he drank the wine.

237
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,550
Not a drop left.

238
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:52,919
Don't worry.

239
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,383
Are all your arranges made tonight?

240
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,696
Yes, like always.

241
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,401
You can screw up, I'm not, okay?

242
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,975
C'mon. You know how he gets.

243
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,148
You have a second thought.

244
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,750
You know what you would
get into, my killer on board.

245
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,550
We can't leave here until...

246
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,592
I know! But what if it doesn't happen?

247
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,288
She is right. We could die here.

248
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,264
That's enough. We're so close.

249
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,599
Only weeks away,
we get stronger everyday.

250
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:44,208
We will succeed. We must.

251
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,375
I need more ashes.

252
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,938
Let's take care of it.

253
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:51,979
You know,

254
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,044
He is with you.

255
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,418
I'm with you, father.

256
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,658
Yeah.

257
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,529
The baby needs to eat.

258
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,027
You know what we would do
to you for the sake of the baby.

259
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,657
Why make yourself miserable?

260
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:44,963
Eat!

261
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,057
Wait.

262
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,186
You find some coffee?

263
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,856
Hey listen, did you eat tonight?

264
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,759
No.

265
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:16,628
Good.

266
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:21,195
Remember if you ever want to
get out of this place, no meat, no wine!

267
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,842
Hey! Sleeping beauty.

268
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,477
Now, where you go?

269
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:46,225
Gibbs! Gibbs!

270
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,368
Gibbs!

271
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,914
Did you hear something?

272
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,508
You are in luck.

273
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,746
We do have one room available.

274
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,257
That's great, I guess.

275
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,225
We just have to find
a place for the night, honeymoon.

276
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,691
Oh, yeah. I'm so glad
that Sharon picked you up.

277
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,732
You know, we love honeymoon this year.

278
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,931
How often have you
been stuck in this fog?

279
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,936
Lots of firsts, if you know what I mean.

280
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:33,799
Scott!

281
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,701
What!

282
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,871
If you just sign the book.
I need you both to sign.

283
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,379
Here you go.

284
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,588
Thanks.

285
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,092
Let's go, honey. I'm cold.

286
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,787
Well, you both get warmed up there.

287
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,573
I don't like this place.

288
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,232
Uh, it's only for one night.

289
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,756
Some honeymoon.

290
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,465
You know what they said,
lousy honeymoon,

291
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,698
Great memory.

292
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,267
Is that what they said?

293
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,251
It's the good thing they came tonight.

294
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,762
We could have taken one of the others.

295
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,808
Spend all these time
building in the Mamati ash.

296
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,945
You know what I need yet?

297
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,541
In his seek it's just weak.

298
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,622
I've never slept
with a married woman before.

299
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,001
Me neither.

300
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,099
You know what I mean?

301
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,002
Yeah.

302
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,344
What's that?

303
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:57,939
I don't know.

304
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,758
Oh, man. This is too weird!

305
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:15,900
What's going on?

306
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,666
I have no idea.

307
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,827
Maybe we should complain.

308
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,238
What are you doing?

309
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,007
This is nuts!

310
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,168
I will take care of it.

311
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,681
Don't answer, for the Christ's sakes.

312
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:35,678
Go away!

313
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,794
Wow! Baby. Well done.

314
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,694
I wanna go! I wanna go right now!

315
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,992
Okay. Okay. Okay. I will get my stuff.

316
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,361
Jesus Christ, man!

317
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,938
What the fucked is up with you?

318
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,104
What the hell have you been?

319
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,837
Looking for you.

320
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,076
We gotta go now.

321
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,076
Oh, you found keys?

322
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,113
I found a car, we gonna hot wired.

323
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,215
We are?

324
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,302
Roy, help me.

325
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,744
Roy, help me.

326
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,994
No...

327
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,370
Where are we?

328
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:52,902
I don't know.

329
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,945
I say it looks familiar, but I...

330
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,412
I never been inside the cloud before.

331
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,386
Now I got ever heard that one.

332
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,284
That's okay.
This is right for that place.

333
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,623
Whatever.

334
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,291
What are we doing? Like two?

335
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,322
Hey, broke the record! You wanna drive?

336
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,523
No, no, no, no.

337
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,695
What if a crippled old ladies

338
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,494
passed in
her son's handicapped scooter,

339
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,659
you let me know.

340
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,738
I will ride with her.
She could go faster than us.

341
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,200
Jesus. What the fuck!

342
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,835
Shit!

343
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,048
Fuck!

344
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,254
Gibbs, we are not going anywhere.

345
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:55,636
What do you think?

346
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,765
I don't believe this.

347
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,809
Beast would shit out
and wander around in the fog.

348
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,476
We gotta get a phone.

349
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,683
All right, if there is
a hot little maid, Gibbs calls dips!

350
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,721
Yeah. Ok!

351
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,624
This is uh...

352
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,098
I don't really know what this is.

353
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,799
Glad I'm not an animal.

354
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,629
Welcome to Mercy.

355
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,069
Sir!

356
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,109
Sir, we really need a car,
a tow truck, ok?

357
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,300
Well, the phone line is been down.

358
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,504
Suggested, maybe they
will be working tomorrow.

359
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,446
I guess you want a room.

360
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,884
If you just sign the book.

361
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,653
Here you go.

362
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,324
Eleven. Twelve.

363
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,458
Appreciate if you both sign.

364
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,893
Hey guys, we get a nice home
cooked breakfast in the dinning hall.

365
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,864
Can't miss it.
Straight around the back.

366
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,942
Yeah. We know where it is.

367
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,035
At least we didn't miss
the breakfast before the bed.

368
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:27,526
Good morning.

369
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,758
We get out of here. Fog, there's no fog.

370
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,261
You know what?
Let's eat breakfast first.

371
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,872
Then we worry about
getting out of here part.

372
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:37,969
Dinner.

373
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,275
Excuse me.

374
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,667
You said breakfast.

375
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,245
Yeah. That's..

376
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,205
that's sort of way me
and my friend like to do it.

377
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,580
We like to save dinner
till the end of a day.

378
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,779
It is the end.

379
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,053
I told you.

380
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,689
It's six fifteen.

381
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,189
In the evening.

382
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,887
It's so weird.

383
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,623
We couldn't dream all day.

384
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,834
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

385
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,034
Man, we miss our geek.

386
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,296
Yes, we miss our geek.

387
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,666
It was yesterday.

388
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,038
I'm Peter Rose. It's my wife, Diane.

389
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,570
Mike Gibbs.

390
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,216
And this is my friend. John Hooke.

391
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,550
Wow! Any Russian Hook from Ohio?

392
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,517
No, there's not.
You already asked me that.

393
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,848
Remember? Last night.

394
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,423
I have an E in the end of mine.
You remember that?

395
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,821
Jesus! This is insane. Let's go, man.

396
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,497
What's the rush?

397
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,188
I suppose to stay for the dinner.

398
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,760
There are some fogs out there, uh?

399
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,931
I like the fog.

400
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,796
Roy, where did two of you last night?

401
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,141
No, just me.

402
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,766
That looks like
settle down anytime either.

403
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,404
But... we don't mind.

404
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,646
Let me guess.

405
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,714
First vacation in years, right?

406
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,553
How did you know?

407
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:01,419
And your boss he can't get by it,
another day or two without you.

408
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,562
I was just going to say that.

409
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,460
I never ....So, how about you?

410
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,461
What brings you here?

411
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,193
Business or pleasure?

412
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,867
I'm just passing through.

413
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,337
Same with us.

414
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,572
We just got here last night.

415
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,574
Wait, where is the Mrs?

416
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,046
You don't remember, uh?

417
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,773
You can't see anything
in this damned fog, right?

418
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,852
That's exactly what I just about to say.

419
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,012
That's amazing.

420
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,921
It's a bit weird.

421
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,658
You're something.

422
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,795
Good evening, everyone.

423
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,825
I think Benedict cooked himself tonight.

424
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,626
I got the wine.

425
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,466
Well.

426
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,966
Enjoy your dinner.

427
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,441
Let's begin.

428
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,850
Where is he? Where is Scott?

429
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,481
Scott?

430
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:02,951
It's my husband.

431
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,350
We went to our room
and with all this chanting.

432
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,559
I know something terrible was happened.

433
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,151
You should sit down
and have some dinner.

434
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,888
I'm not hungry.

435
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,457
Have some wine, sweety.
It will calm your nerves.

436
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,927
Don't, no. Don't...

437
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,495
I think I'm hungry after all.

438
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,461
What about Scott?

439
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,139
Who?

440
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,939
I haven't had a brussels sprouts...

441
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,008
In years?

442
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,678
Years, right?

443
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,077
And your husband he
loves brussels sprouts, doesn't he?

444
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,276
Yeah. He does love brussels sprouts.

445
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,610
Don't you people remember?

446
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,650
You don't remember
the introduction and small talk,

447
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,987
the roast beef, the fucking sprouts?

448
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,286
You don't remember?

449
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,458
We did this
exactly same thing last night.

450
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,893
You guys don't remember?

451
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,828
Roy! Where is your wife?

452
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,255
Susan!

453
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,226
She is right there.

454
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,098
That's not his wife! For Christ's sakes!

455
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,136
You don't remember?

456
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,603
How could you not remember?

457
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,498
Jesus!

458
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,326
Where is Ramon?

459
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,659
He had to fetch more.
Sorry.

460
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,796
Perhaps you forgot what's the stake.

461
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,835
We need the trinity.

462
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,130
I said I'm sorry.

463
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,143
Bless the ash.

464
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,415
Create the healthy child
and we all will be free.

465
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,724
Create the child.

466
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,126
Create the child.

467
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,629
Create the child.

468
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,460
Create the child.

469
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,604
Look at her.

470
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,841
Another weak link,
just like the others.

471
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,138
And choose to spit out
and not to use any longer fresh,

472
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,008
if she does miss the carry first.

473
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,012
Patience.

474
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,250
That's we get stronger,
so do the babies.

475
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,976
Well, not one of them
must fight for more than couple days.

476
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,554
This page will be different.

477
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,326
Look at this healthy child.

478
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,957
Before the ninth?

479
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,019
We are running out the time.

480
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,260
She is not cooperating.

481
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,335
Some of them won't eat
meat or drink the wine.

482
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,370
We can't risk taking the child.

483
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,064
This one is very close.

484
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,204
Then what? Another dead one for sharing?

485
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,838
Or maybe this time we would be lucky

486
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,105
and we would only have
two arms and two legs.

487
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,477
You took this on.

488
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,240
You made the choice years ago.

489
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:19,181
You wouldn't given us this job
if you didn't think we can do it.

490
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,716
Of course.

491
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,090
You're right.

492
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,487
September ninth is so close.

493
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,395
And finally
we can leave here for eternity.

494
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,500
That's better.

495
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,595
There're so much to look forward to.

496
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,663
Please let me out.

497
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,703
Please.

498
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,671
You can't just keep me here forever.

499
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,036
People will miss me.

500
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,607
She's almost too.

501
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,873
I can't wait to be doing with this.

502
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,041
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

503
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,483
I will give you anything.
Just please let me and my baby out.

504
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,589
Just becoming so tedious.

505
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,212
Becoming!

506
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:59,590
I've got some lovely wine.
I just can't wait for her to try it.

507
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,490
No, please don't go.
Please! Please!

508
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,004
Shut up!

509
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,197
How did you know that I just want you?

510
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,870
All that chilling really gets you going.

511
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,703
You want some more?

512
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,457
I'm done.

513
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,361
So you're checking out
the new starter over here?

514
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,257
He was cute.

515
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,228
Cute and tasty.

516
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,205
Like a baby bird.

517
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,307
You're jealous?

518
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,110
Right.

519
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,170
I'm jealous.

520
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,183
Next time, he comes
and bring one of the other girls.

521
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:30,879
I'm getting bored.

522
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,063
Bored my ass.

523
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:57,142
It's me.

524
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,744
What the hell you think you're
doing out here in this town at night?

525
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,078
You want to get yourself killed?

526
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,150
We need to talk.

527
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,278
Now.

528
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,128
I see you're starting to remember.

529
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,396
There is something about it.

530
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,438
That's right, honey.

531
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,177
You worked for that band.

532
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,116
Jack!

533
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,483
Good!

534
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,488
The ash is running off.

535
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,456
Ash?

536
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,922
What are you talking about?

537
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,165
Take it easy.

538
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,360
You don't get something
from nothing around here.

539
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,433
Tell me.

540
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,004
You got promised to get me out of here.

541
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,137
I promise.

542
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,738
Then you tell me
what the hell is going on.

543
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,173
What is this place?

544
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,737
Benedict, Elizabeth and Armon,

545
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,177
They are witches. They kill people.

546
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,251
They killed your friend.

547
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,448
Gibbs?

548
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,952
Not Gibbs.

549
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,987
He has eating and drinking
and having great all times.

550
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,197
I can't.

551
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,233
Remember.

552
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,101
I know.

553
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:30,640
There was a man.

554
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,036
Some man with the beard.

555
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,277
Jack?

556
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:38,972
He is dead.

557
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,339
Jack is dead?

558
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,015
They killed all the ones first.

559
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,313
No stand with it now.

560
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,921
What about the rest of us?

561
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,359
Right now, that's not important.

562
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,522
The important thing is to get out.

563
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,428
I tried!

564
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,360
I can't fucking leave here!

565
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,366
I can't leave. Why can't I leave here?

566
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,132
Because you signed the book.

567
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,402
Once you signed the book, that's it.

568
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,101
It's like you signed your life away.

569
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,577
They want you eat and drink,
the ash just makes it easy.

570
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,208
The ash is in the food and drink?

571
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,309
It's like some kind of mind control.

572
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,451
The ash just make you forget.

573
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,453
But not me. Why?

574
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,220
Because I made damn sure
your food is clean. That's why.

575
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,631
When you saw this...

576
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:41,371
Shit!

577
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,704
He takes the drugs on us.

578
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,105
The food and the wine.

579
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,042
Thanks for my screw-up liver.

580
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,175
No wine for Jacky boy.

581
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,718
You have to make this
all kind sounds a little bit crazy?

582
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,185
When do we get here?
When do we get here?

583
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,152
According to you it's..

584
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,655
No, when do you remember
getting here?

585
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,621
Yesterday

586
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,885
Okay, what's the day that date?

587
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,756
It's Thursday.
October twenty-third.

588
00:49:58,895 --> 00:49:59,361
Thursday.

589
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,657
I took this from the couple
that showed up yesterday.

590
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:02,560
Whenever, whenever.

591
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,395
Roy and Susan something or other?
October, right?

592
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:06,669
Read the date.

593
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,267
April fourth.

594
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,599
Two thousand nine.

595
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,367
We have been here for six months?

596
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,408
I think time is altered.

597
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,808
Maybe a day here is a week
outside or a month. I don't know!

598
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,915
How did you know we haven't
figured this out all before?

599
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,040
We don't know.

600
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,810
Well! That's just fucking great!

601
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:23,984
That's great.

602
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,294
We should remember now.

603
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,034
Oh my god!

604
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:42,803
How do we get out of here?

605
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,068
That nasty old van,
you know Charon the driver?

606
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,038
Don't even think about taking that van.

607
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,079
Charon's the only one
can get to the portal.

608
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,407
Even Benedict,
the others either cannot, until...

609
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:57,350
Until when?

610
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,211
That's enough.

611
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,716
You just get back
like everyone else.

612
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,153
Don't let on that your memory is
coming back or else we were both dead.

613
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:09,354
Wait!

614
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,126
How do I know I can trust you?

615
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,263
I worship God.

616
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,162
Help me.

617
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,204
How did you find me?

618
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,013
Do I know you?

619
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,521
I will be back.

620
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,789
I promise.

621
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:23,530
No...

622
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,293
Elizabeth wants to see you.

623
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,761
Sure. Baby.

624
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:55,727
Now!

625
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,733
You better save some to me.

626
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:03,830
I will think about it.

627
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,081
Lucky you.

628
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,228
Hooke.

629
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,172
Please. Please no.

630
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,483
The betrayal should be
divided in the penalty.

631
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,649
I don't know what you mean.

632
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,344
We live to serve you.

633
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,556
Please! Father.

634
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,588
No...

635
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,880
Gibbs! Gibbs! Open up.

636
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,687
Good evening.

637
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,159
Gibbs!

638
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,706
There you are. Come!

639
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,105
You're not gonna believe this.

640
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:56,878
But we slept the entire day.
You know it's six pm.

641
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,117
I know.

642
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:00,847
What do you mean you know?

643
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,216
I know it's fucking dark outside,
I know!

644
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,920
He must got late last night

645
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,621
Or really early in the morning.

646
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,822
I have enough for this.
Anybody else hungry?

647
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,197
Gibbs.

648
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,198
Good evening, everyone.

649
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,766
I think Benedict cooked himself tonight.

650
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:19,897
I get the wine.

651
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,602
Let's not keep our guests waiting.

652
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,307
It's fog out there, right?

653
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,780
Yeah, I bet it won't run off.

654
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,481
I may take this bit soup
when I was driving in yesterday.

655
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:32,521
Roy, he is sales man.
He knows his parts very well.

656
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,614
This is Peter and Diane.

657
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,385
This is Nora.

658
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,062
Oh, this is my friend. John Hooke.

659
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,361
Hook, there's a
Russian Hook from Ohio. H.o.o.k

660
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,026
No, I don't think so.

661
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:48,770
I can't believe this.

662
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,436
I love brussels sprouts.
Really?

663
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,336
This looks so delicious.

664
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,041
You are not in a mood for meat tonight?

665
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,615
No, I am.

666
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,549
You're kidding me.
I love this, love this.

667
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:08,748
Gorgeous.

668
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,758
Well, enjoy everyone.

669
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,303
You don't like it?

670
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,370
I have it.

671
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,338
Listen to me.

672
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,569
You didn't believe me before.
You gotta believe me now.

673
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,508
Jesus Christ! Stop!

674
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:32,580
Cut it out. Man!

675
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:33,443
Listen to me.

676
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,515
It doesn't have to happen.

677
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,310
We can get out of here.

678
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,783
We've done this for hundreds of times!

679
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,209
We gonna...

680
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:42,826
Roy! Susan! Your wife.
You don't even remember Susan!

681
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,659
Gibbs! Jack. Don't you remember...

682
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,922
Gibbs! Jesus Christ!

683
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,529
You gotta remember!

684
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,301
Gibbs, you gotta come
with me now. Now!

685
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:53,493
Now!

686
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,265
Fuck!

687
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,324
I will make this really easy for you.

688
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,523
You give me the keys. You leave.

689
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,566
You don't remember, do you?

690
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,528
No, you don't remember.

691
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:04,972
You will never leave here.

692
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:08,068
No one would make me pass the portal.

693
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,309
Why is that?

694
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,275
It's magic. Baby.

695
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,449
No one but me can leave Mercy.

696
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,377
Not until...

697
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,386
Until... till to when?

698
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:22,224
Until the child was born.

699
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,251
Those cages!

700
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:27,394
Those women!

701
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,655
Those women are breeding!

702
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,463
The babies were born
and dead would be done.

703
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
You rapped them!

704
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:38,906
Not me! That will be your job.

705
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,099
Oh my god.

706
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:05,825
Oh my god.

707
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,363
What have I done?

708
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:10,661
What did you do to them?

709
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,367
You would never leave here alive.

710
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:24,314
Not you. Not your friends.
Not your girlfriend.

711
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:26,488
What girlfriend!

712
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,456
You can't remember?

713
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,856
Which one of these.

714
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,460
Give me the keys.

715
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,362
That's too late.

716
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:52,180
Time has come.
The child will be born.

717
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,062
Where the keys?

718
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,299
Fucking keys!

719
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,233
Shit!

720
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:24,510
Kim.

721
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,726
You came back.

722
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,332
Kim, I remember you.

723
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,764
Holy god.

724
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,830
The other day, I wasn't sure.

725
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:49,872
How long has it been since?

726
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:50,802
I don't know.

727
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:55,543
Judging by the size of me seven,
maybe eight months.

728
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,612
I didn't even know you are gone.

729
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,143
It wasn't you, Hooke.

730
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:03,944
You remember?

731
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,619
No meat, no wine, not knowing
why you're pregnant.

732
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,224
I think this ash will hurt the baby.

733
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,519
We gotta get you out of here.

734
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,856
There is a key in the stand by the door.

735
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,040
I miss you.

736
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,637
What about the others?

737
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,143
Gibbs and Jack?

738
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:32,981
Jack is dead.

739
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,318
God! This is so evil!

740
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,245
No, we would never get out of here!

741
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:43,047
We just come back and
I can't go back to that cage!

742
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:44,454
I can't...

743
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,561
Listen. Listen.

744
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,663
We can get out of here, all right?

745
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,731
Everyone. You, me, Gibbs.

746
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,165
We can get out of here
but you need to be strong, understand?

747
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,535
Going somewhere?

748
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,001
I can smell your
when you get in the door.

749
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:00,200
Get out of my way, lady.

750
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,976
You solve the riddle
and maybe I will let you go.

751
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,639
What will the world look like
at night, night all night.

752
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,717
I don't give a shit!

753
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,242
I'll give you a hand.

754
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:18,825
It's not real!

755
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,597
None of this is real!

756
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,099
C'mon! We go.

757
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,837
Wait! Wait! We can't just
leave these women like this.

758
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,669
Get out of here. Let's go.

759
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,179
Good luck.

760
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,496
What about the others?

761
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:56,897
Believe me, I tried.

762
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,159
There's nothing
we can do for them now.

763
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,563
I gotta get you out of here.

764
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,601
It's better work.

765
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,197
Do you know where we are going?

766
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,972
I have no idea.
I know there is a portal.

767
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,163
There is only way out.

768
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,137
A portal?

769
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,073
Yeah. It's a long story.

770
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,211
What was that?

771
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:16,785
Previous owner.

772
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:22,922
Did you see that?

773
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,954
Yeah... that's the portal,
that's the right. Hang on baby.

774
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,396
We did it.

775
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,029
How can I forget how much I love you?

776
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,237
You made that.

777
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:17,470
You and me, and...

778
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,408
You don't think that is..

779
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,143
Son of the devil?

780
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,087
I don't know.
It sounds pretty witch shit.

781
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,484
But I know the drug does.

782
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,793
So, what do we do now on me?

783
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,656
Please don't leave us.

784
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,024
No, nobody will.

785
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:43,400
Wait here.

786
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:53,912
Just get in.

787
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,046
Look.
What are you doing?

788
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,689
No...you are not going back there.

789
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:02,483
Kim, I have to.

790
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,616
No! We just got out of there.

791
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,228
What if the chances you
won't make it back out?

792
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,592
What if you forgot again?

793
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:10,890
Never forget.

794
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,600
You can't just leave me like this.

795
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,260
Listen! He's going
and driving there, okay?

796
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,803
When you get there, wait!

797
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,636
When I come back,
we will get you to the hospital.

798
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:20,705
We will get you to the hospital.

799
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,811
Everything is going to be ok.
You and the baby.

800
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,807
Promise me.

801
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:27,848
I promise.

802
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,650
I love you.

803
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,114
All right, Go. Go.

804
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:45,893
Man, I hope this works.

805
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,431
C'mon, baby! C'mon.

806
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,310
C'mon. C'mon.

807
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,818
Double the dose ash.

808
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,382
You think it's the right time?

809
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,926
Are you questioning me?

810
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:47,728
One woman is missing.

811
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,889
The other is
scattering around the grounds.

812
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,492
We need to retake control.

813
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,998
Nothing will happen to the babies.

814
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,101
Don't worry.

815
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:03,475
Coward has no way to go.
Ashes, the child.

816
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:16,788
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think Benedict cooked himself tonight.

817
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,493
Where is..

818
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,791
You're looking for someone?

819
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,967
Where is Gibbs?

820
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,167
Who is Gibbs?

821
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,828
I don't know anybody's name Gibbs.

822
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:31,037
Yes, you do.

823
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,407
You all do.

824
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,474
You flirt with him every night.

825
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,675
You all know him.

826
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,342
Peter! Think.

827
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:39,709
Do I know you?

828
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:40,873
Yes, you know me.

829
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,212
You and Diane know me real well.

830
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,115
Sweety, we've never met before.

831
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:49,850
Peter! C'mon. Think. Spend the vacation.

832
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,117
God knows how you and your shit hole!

833
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,328
But you know boss can't...

834
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,328
get by without me?

835
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,699
How long have we been here?

836
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,195
He is obviously confused.

837
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,034
Don't listen to him.

838
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:06,004
What's going on here?

839
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,336
Yea, who are you?

840
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,968
Roy! How long have you been here?

841
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,044
I came in here yesterday, Sir.

842
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,013
Hey, you can cut the sir crap!

843
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:15,484
I'm Hooke.

844
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,649
With an E. Any relationship with Ohio.

845
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,052
How many god damn times
you say that one?

846
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:27,428
You are overwhelmed.
Sit, have a glass of wine.

847
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:30,298
It will make you feel better.

848
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,923
You sit down. Sit!

849
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,203
He comes here alone, Roy?

850
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,009
Yes, we did.

851
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,175
Is that right, sister?

852
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,116
Answer me!

853
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:54,951
No.

854
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:58,925
No, is the name
Susan ring the bell, Roy?

855
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:00,428
Susan?

856
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,127
It's your wife, Roy.

857
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,358
Look that newspaper you have been read.

858
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,867
How many times you read that?
It's four months oId.

859
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,166
I don't understand.

860
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,297
Oh my god! Susi...

861
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,836
Yeah, that's right.

862
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:19,637
Now, where is Gibbs?

863
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,381
I don't know what you are talking about.

864
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,712
Where is Gibbs?

865
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:34,026
You didn't think you can run for mess
with that consequence, did you?

866
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,936
Clean these plates. All but one.

867
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:43,871
But...

868
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,030
Do it!

869
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,107
Or I will kill her right here,
right now.

870
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:51,342
Do it.

871
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,479
So ladies and gentlemen,

872
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,416
looks like our host is going to
join us for dinner for once.

873
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:01,988
I can't eat that.

874
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:05,157
Why, it's delicious, right?

875
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,693
Benedict did that himself, didn't he?

876
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,762
You don't understand.

877
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,460
I'm not like you.

878
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:15,729
We will find out.

879
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:18,397
Eat.

880
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,370
No.

881
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,210
Eat!

882
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,215
Eat it!

883
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,778
Benedict!

884
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,357
Benedict!

885
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,324
Elizabeth!

886
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:40,884
I eat in the ash.

887
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:41,861
You ate something.

888
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:46,865
She is dying. Do something.

889
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,601
She eats the ash. Nothing I can do.

890
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:50,964
They're gonna remember.

891
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,367
It doesn't matter, they can't stop this!

892
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,069
Where is Susan?

893
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,369
Oh my god!

894
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,536
Scott!

895
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,680
I came here with my mom.

896
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,209
Where is my mom?

897
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,714
What's happening to her?

898
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,122
We can't do it without her.

899
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,693
The trinity is broken.

900
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,458
It's quite failed for the cover.

901
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,532
And it will make him a hero
and they will give him all the glory!

902
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,862
No one would get the shit,
for the eternity!

903
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,595
Get control of yourself.

904
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,107
We are not finished.
Not when we get this close.

905
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:30,209
Find Charon. Karin and her nurse
will take care of the guests.

906
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,978
Get to the office. We will keep back.

907
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,749
No...no...no.. I'm not leaving you.

908
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:37,874
Get out here, we will find you.

909
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,647
No. I am staying with you.
Please.

910
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,517
Peter, the table! Let's go.

911
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,995
No, no. Get out of him.

912
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,792
Leave him alone.

913
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,994
Oh my god, Peter.

914
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,399
Oh, shit!

915
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:57,861
Gibbs.

916
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,741
Hooke? Nora?

917
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,003
It's me, Nora.

918
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:14,571
Where is Hooke?

919
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,649
I thought he was with you.

920
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,151
Oh my god! Oh my god!

921
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,381
We are gonna die
just like all the others.

922
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:23,188
No, we are not.

923
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,383
We gonna find Hooke.

924
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,335
Hooke, Hooke.

925
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:41,836
Thank god! We found you.

926
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,379
I thought you were dead too.

927
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,143
We get out of here, now,
all right? C'mon.

928
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,266
Shit!

929
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,310
Keys! Keys...

930
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:20,779
Shit!

931
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,575
Oh! Fuck!

932
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,552
Fuck me!

933
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:37,526
Fuck!

934
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:42,703
Fuck! No. Come on!

935
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,208
You have no idea what you've done.

936
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,511
You never got finished now.

937
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,543
No driver. No key.

938
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,452
Damn it to hell.
This not what I signed that book!

939
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,113
We got out, you know.

940
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,211
Right through the portal.

941
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:03,686
Then you must have the key!

942
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,487
Just give him the key for God's sake.

943
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:06,656
That's right.

944
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,389
For God's sake.

945
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:09,760
OK.

946
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,867
All right!

947
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:17,068
There you go.

948
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,503
This is the way out. This is key.

949
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,647
Van! Get to the van!

950
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,389
Keys!

951
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:49,835
It's over.

952
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,336
You have no idea.

953
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,036
This is just the beginning.

954
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,802
You don't need us anymore.
Just let us go.

955
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,240
What I need is the child. I need it now.

956
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:05,310
Push!

957
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:15,547
Is everything ok?

958
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,756
Everything is fine.

959
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,788
Congratulations.
You have a very healthy baby.

960
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,027
A girl?

961
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:25,894
A beautiful girl.

962
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,468
See, I told you so
everything has gone right

963
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:34,597
Hello.

964
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,402
Here is mommy.

965
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,543
Are you sure anything
is going to be okay?

966
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:49,490
Yeah. I'm certain. It's new beginning.

967
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:50,386
Hey.
