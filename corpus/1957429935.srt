00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:23,182
[material ripping]

176
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:24,891
[Nate] the best come
out of the Survival...

177
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:25,599
Feels good, huh?

178
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:26,599
[Nate] Survival manual...

179
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,223
[Nate] How to get water
out of a cactus...

180
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,599
I been hooked on paper making

181
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,390
ever since the first
time I heard that sound.

182
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:34,348
Snare a seagull's
leg or some shit.

183
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,099
[laughter]
Like impossible things,

184
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:37,849
if you got to jump off a ship,

185
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,891
they advise you to
take your pants off

186
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,599
and put them over your head.

187
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,265
[Will] That shit works?

188
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:42,432
[Nate] I don't know.

189
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:45,432
I guess it kinda does!
it's better than nothing, but...

190
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:46,891
[Eli] So sometimes
what we'll do

191
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,849
is we'll cut the uniform
off the veteran's body.

192
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:52,348
So like the first
guy who did it,

193
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:54,098
he cut it from his own body

194
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:58,098
and then I had him and another
friend cut it off my body

195
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,640
as this sort of rite of passage.

196
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:00,265
[Walt] Okinawa's a
pretty trippy place

197
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:02,348
even without LSD.

198
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:05,599
So I remember
going, in high school,

199
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,766
going the guidance
counselors office.

200
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:11,223
"What do you want to
do after you graduate?"

201
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:13,390
So I wrote on there,

202
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:16,807
I wanna go to college
and work with computers

203
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:21,557
and I spelled college
and computers wrong.

204
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,724
I was never really
good at spelling.

205
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,058
[Kevin laughs]

206
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,974
I'm better now, but

207
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,474
the guy pivots in his
chair, within arm's reach

208
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:33,223
is a whole rack of
recruiting pamphlets.

209
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:36,098
He grabs the US Army with
the Apache helicopter

210
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,557
right on the top.

211
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,599
Up against the car and I
said, I'm here for the party.

212
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,724
I'm here for the party
because I genuinely thought

213
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:42,932
that I was at the right house.

214
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,265
I thought I was there
for, for a party

215
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,515
and he said, I
don't know that guy.

216
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:51,432
They cuffed me, stuffed me,
took me to the county jail.

217
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:55,724
Wrong fucking house.
Felony criminal trespass,

218
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,932
public intoxication,

219
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:00,265
do 90 days in jail,

220
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:04,474
then after that go to the
military, I get a clean record.

221
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,515
My life was going this
direction and very suddenly,

222
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,807
it turned and went
this direction,

223
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,724
like I stepped into an
alternative reality or something.

224
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,474
So how are you
holding up, man?

225
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:19,474
I'm good man, thanks.

226
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:24,849
You sleeping?

227
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:27,557
[both scoffing]

228
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:30,766
Yeah, me neither.

229
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,265
So, you've been in touch
with his family yet, or what?

230
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:35,390
Yeah man, I uh,
called his mom.

231
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,640
I didn't know what the fuck
to say, just hysterical.

232
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:42,182
There's not much you can say.

233
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:45,599
I'm here, you know, need
anything, blah, blah, blah.

234
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,307
Ask her for a photo or
uniform, make a memorial.

235
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,682
It seems like every time
I'm finishing up one,

236
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:52,307
I got to start on another.

237
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,599
Yeah man, just let me
know what you want.

238
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:59,015
I'm happy to help.

239
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:02,973
When I was at WestPoint,
they were talking about,

240
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:06,057
"Well, we'll send them
the big battalions."

241
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,265
That's what they
sent in in 1965.

242
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,849
Battalions? Not divisions?

243
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,599
We didn't even have
helmets that much

244
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,390
in, in that
timeframe in Vietnam.

245
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:24,599
You know, I never saved
any of my uniforms,

246
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,599
so I don't have one to cut up.

247
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,098
[Kevin] Really?

248
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,766
[Jan] Yeah, I just wanted
to get out of the military,

249
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:30,973
Finally got so frustrated,
I went and joined

250
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:35,307
a peace demonstration in 1967.

251
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:38,807
Somebody had provided a banner

252
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:41,015
that said Vietnam
Veterans Against the War,

253
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:41,931
so they were at the very
beginning of this march

254
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,265
coming out of Central Park

255
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:47,973
and we'd been told

256
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:49,891
that you'd get in big trouble

257
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:53,182
if you wore a uniform
to a political event,

258
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:56,098
[Isabelle ripping uniform]
but in January of 68,

259
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,849
enough people were
fed up with the fact

260
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:00,348
that the war continued
and continued.

261
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:05,307
[train whirring]

262
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,973
[suspenseful music]

263
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:27,474
[Woman's laughter]
[voices chattering]

264
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,307
Timothy or Tim

265
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,307
either is really fine.

266
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,098
So am I supposed to say
how I feel or something?

267
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:56,307
Know how the little smileys,

268
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,057
you know, that says
like, "How d'ya feel?"

269
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,849
- Nah...
- Yeah?

270
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,766
[both chuckling]

271
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:03,848
- All right?
- Yeah, fair.

272
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:12,432
[door clicking]
[alarm chimes]

273
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,557
Hi, Neil.

274
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:18,348
Thousands of people,
veterans, staff members,

275
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,515
family members coming
and going to the hospital

276
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,807
and also residents
on the street.

277
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,057
I took out this sign.

278
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,223
This project had been on
my mind for some time.

279
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:34,599
Alright, Bud, I'll
see ya next week.

280
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:35,973
Okay, thank you.

281
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:37,973
Awesome.

282
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:40,599
Every time I called it
a war Timothy got upset.

283
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:41,474
Corrects me.

284
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:43,265
[Ed] What did he
want you to call it?

285
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:46,474
An occupation.

286
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,474
Shit, Vietnam was an
occupation too, still a war.

287
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,973
This is different.

288
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,182
Every generation thinks
their war is different.

289
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,057
You know, I'm back
on the meds myself.

290
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,432
I'm sorry to hear that.

291
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:04,057
I figured I was pretty
well past all this shit.

292
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:10,557
Then I started seeing you
guys coming home, burned,

293
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:15,766
amputated limbs, PTSD, this
traumatic brain injury now,

294
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:17,265
all that shit.

295
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:17,474
Just like when I came back.

296
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:22,057
Resurrects a lot of shit.

297
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,348
You've been doing peer
to peer now for what?

298
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,765
Three years? It's inevitable.

299
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,432
You were gonna go through this.

300
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,599
I'm thinking some time off.

301
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:35,848
Did you speak to his regular
doctor or his VA shrink?

302
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,474
The department's looking
into this kid's case,

303
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:40,223
but you know what
they're going to say.

304
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:43,015
They didn't know
about the other meds.

305
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:45,931
Everyone signs that agreement.

306
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:49,015
They're not getting meds
from an outside provider.

307
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:50,432
That's how they
cover their asses.

308
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:52,348
VA is gonna wash
their hands of it.

309
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:56,057
I know the system's
fucked in a lot of ways,

310
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,474
but it ain't on them.

311
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,432
And it ain't on you either,
brother, you gotta know that.

312
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:04,557
Either he had a provider
from outside the system

313
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,723
or he was getting that
shit off the street.

314
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,307
I know what you're
going through.

315
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:15,973
I mean, shit, if he was lying
about what he was taking,

316
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,848
there's really no way
for anyone to know.

317
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:23,390
I hate to say it, but
if a kid wants to die,

318
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,640
he's gonna find a way.

319
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:33,098

325
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:47,098
I mean, you can feel it,
people, Arkansas, California.

326
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,931
- Was cold as shit.
- Cold as shit!

327
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:50,639
The youth started that fight.

328
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,931
- Hm mm.
- The elders lost it.

329
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:55,265
'Cause they were telling us,

330
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:56,765
"Yeah, we can trust the courts."

331
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:59,931
"This thing it's gonna
be fine, we can go home."

332
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,765
"We don't want
anyone to get hurt."

Meanwhile, the kids
were the radicals.

334
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,307
They were saying, "No, we
don't want this pipeline."

335
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,223
- "Or any pipeline."
- Right, right.

don't trust the President.

- Hey, welcome back.
- S'up?

Just getting set up.

340
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:20,723
Can I help?

341
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:21,474
Yeah all of this
has to go out.

00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:44,474
[Walt] Belgium. They
rebuilt it, actually...

349
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:47,098
[Eli] When you rebuild
a building like that, though

350
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:48,265
is it still, like...

351
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:49,765
[water splashing]

352
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,057
[Eli] it's not the same thing.

353
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:55,140
[Eli] Feel like they should
have to give it a different name

354
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:58,765
[Eli] If something's destroyed you can't
rename its replacement the same thing

355
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:03,182
[Walt] Well, ya know, the...
[Eli] Let the name die with the thing

356
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:04,848
[Walt] It didn't die

357
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,474
[Eli] If it burned
down, it fuckin died

358
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,931
[Walt] it was resurrected

359
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:11,307
[Eli] It's a building, it ain't-
a fucking Messiah.

360
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,265
[Walt] Well, I'll tell you something,
if there's any possibility...

361
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:17,556
of a ressurrection,
I would think....

362
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:23,390
Nah, I was uh... I
deployed three times.

he - he is still a hero.

acknowledges what he did,

371
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:50,390
y'know, warning Congress
about all these capitalists

Roosevelt administration.

It's okay

375

Sometimes you'll get really
rough ones like this,

376
00:20:58,514 --> 00:21:00,140
but you know, once you
get the hang of it,

377
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:03,432
you can make them smooth
and corners sharp.

the Beglians that.

shouldn't rebuild shit

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,057
when it's destroyed,
by all means we should,

387
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,598
but I think you should give
it a new name, a new identity

388
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:30,432
- part of acknowledging...
- Well, I'm gonna write...

389
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,432

the end of one life,

- Wait, no, not in there.

[Walt] A letter, the
Belgians and tell them...

394
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,390
[Eli] Tell em to
change that fucking name.

395
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:45,098
[Walt] Rename it the
Eli Wright Building.

396

love about this process is,

402
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:14,556
it's forgiving, you know?

403
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,890
Like if you fuck up,
you can always fix it

404
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,848
and you can always do it over.

405

it'd be good to be

all to the ground,

of light in the shadows.

00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:34,722
You remember how

695
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,388
they used to fire
off guns at weddings?

696
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:41,597
Full auto, 30 round bursts.

697
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:45,680
Must go through
a dozen magazines

698
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:46,347
every time someone gets married.

699
00:39:57,347 --> 00:40:00,264
In the beginning when
we first got in country,

700
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:06,764
we'd hear shots off
in the distance,

701
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,056
four or five miles away.

702
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,139
And we'd see the tracers
flying up through the air.

703
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:14,222
We would go tearing
down the road

704
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:15,472
in our gun trucks,
looking for a fight.

705
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:19,472
But there was nothing.

706
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:26,764
No firefight, no insurgents.

707
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:29,972
Just, just a couple of
people getting married.

708
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:36,097
[Timothy sniffs]

709
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:39,764
Of course. After, after a
while we figured it out,

710
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,847
we'd hear the gunfire
at the certain hour

711
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,430
and look at our
watches, figure out

712
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:51,305
what day of the week it was,
nod back and forth and say,

713
00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:56,264
"Yup, just another
wedding." Right?

714
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:11,930
But I don't think we ever
really did figure it out.

715
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:20,056
[Will] What was
there to figure out?

716
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:27,430
that it was...

717
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:30,680
just a couple of people
getting married.

718
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:32,346
Timothy, let me
ask you something.

719
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:37,388
Why do you think they
turned down your claim?

720
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:39,972
I really don't know.

721
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:43,555
Look,

722
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:47,139
to be approved by the
VA for post-traumatic stress.

723
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,597
You got to demonstrate
some traumatic experience.

724
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,305
Life-threatening situation,
something along those lines.

725
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:59,305
- See what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

726
00:42:02,513 --> 00:42:04,972
When I looked at
the VA's decision,

727
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,388
it says you didn't have
that kind of experience.

728
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:10,930
I told them my story.

729
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,889
They just didn't get it.

730
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:21,181
[Will] Yeah, well.

731
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:24,014
That happens.

732
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,764
You think you could
tell me your story?

733
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:35,764
Yeah.

734
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,930
[Timothy sniffs]

735
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:39,430
Yeah, of course.

736
00:42:41,764 --> 00:42:44,555
[suspenseful music]

737
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:52,014
[hammer tapping]

738
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:18,930
[men talking softly]

739
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:24,305
[hammer tapping]

740
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,472
Eli, the labels
go on lower right?

741
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:34,097
Yeah.

742
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,597
He's gonna come along and
move 'em all, anyway...

743
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,221
[Nate's laughter]
[music cresting]

744
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:40,680
[Walt] All the artwork
you see in this gallery

745
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:43,930
was handmade from
American military uniforms.

746
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:47,097
We take the uniforms, we
cut them into small pieces

747
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,472
- and we put them...
- We were involved in

748
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:50,346
Interrogation processes...

749
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:54,347
Sure, US put him in
there in the first place.

750
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,263
As a medic they want you to
monitor and - and -

751
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:02,430
- [Sarah] throw acid on
LaVena Johnson's genitals

752
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:05,847
[Eli] whether they're able to
endure further interrogation

753
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,972
So, at this point, this dude had
been in there for three days

754
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:10,097
It's been a disaster!

755
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,430
Johnny was involved
in multiple situations

756
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:14,597
Where they kept calling
him back to take care of...

757
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,680
- all of these prisoners
- Peace is the only...

758
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:18,597
- real war memorial.
- interrogation processes that...

759
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,056
included torture.

760
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:22,889
Coming back from Iraq,
Johnny killed himself.

761
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:24,764
They give you a free
hall if someone dies.

762
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:26,847
A lot of the artists
are on the premises now

763
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,472
All outta wine,
I'll go get some.

764
00:44:28,555 --> 00:44:30,472
Nah, it's cool, I'll get it.

765
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:34,056
It is a way to kind
of tell their stories,

766
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,096
since they can't.

767
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,346
Thank you for your service!

768
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,513
[door squeaks]

769
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,889
[footsteps]

770
00:44:49,096 --> 00:44:49,388
[door squeaks]

771
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:52,930
[footsteps]

772
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:56,889
You heading out?

773
00:44:56,972 --> 00:44:58,513
Yeah, I was gonna
get some smokes.

774
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:07,346
Man, I love Eli's piece with
the dude with a skeleton hand

775
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,930
and the phone? That
shit's bananas.

776
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:11,096
Ah yeah, super dope piece.

777
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,597
Barbed wire?

778
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,680
I'm gonna do something with
barbed wire, I got... an idea.

779
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:19,221
Thought you quit?

780
00:45:20,014 --> 00:45:21,805
I did. But.

781
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:24,930
I don't know, cigarettes
are my friend right now

782
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,346
you know?

783
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:29,805
Sometimes, you know, "cause
it kills you!" is just not

784
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:30,472
a fucking 'nough, you know?

785
00:45:32,972 --> 00:45:33,889
Yeah, I try and
just think of it

786
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:36,096
like this giant
corporation that could

787
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,430
give a fuck whether
I die or live, so...

788
00:45:39,472 --> 00:45:41,138
I don't want to be run by that.

789
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,305
Don't wanna be dependent,
fuck that.

790
00:45:48,138 --> 00:45:51,096
You talk with a kind
of a lilty, like, lispy thing.

791
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,388
Where are you from anyway?

792
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:56,847
Baton Rouge.

793
00:46:00,305 --> 00:46:01,764
I don't think you mean lisp.

794
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,597
[footsteps]

795
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,138
And all those people in there?

796
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:14,513
It's great that they
come out, you know, but...

797
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,096
you can't, like, have
the conversation.

798
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,305
You can't really have it.

799
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:23,597
No one wants to talk
about dying, yeah.

800
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,805
There's never any
context for it, you know,

801
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:28,055
we don't make space for
it, ever. We just...

802
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,263
But then how do you...?

803
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:33,472
Well, yeah, I mean, how
do you prevent something

804
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:36,346
that you can't fucking
talk about ever, right?

805
00:46:38,638 --> 00:46:42,764
I had, uh, I had a friend
from New Orleans once,

806
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,555
he was kind of a drug dealer,
but he was, he was a cool guy.

807
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:57,555
It's right here.

808
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:57,680
I'll wait here.

809
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:18,555
[Isabelle sniffs]

810
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,430
[Isabelle sobs]

811
00:47:43,722 --> 00:47:46,346
[car honking]

812
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,221
[suspenseful music building]

813
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:57,472
[Isabelle hyperventilating]

814
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,263
Yo, what are you doin'?

815
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:11,430
[Isabelle sniffs]

816
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,513
I'm okay.

817
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:14,263
I'm just, this fucking
thing just keeps

818
00:48:14,346 --> 00:48:16,180
correcting me all
the fucking time.

819
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:17,764
I'm fine.
[Isabelle sniffs]

820
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:18,680
I'm good.

821
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:36,346
Hey, maybe you should
just breathe, you know,

822
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:39,221
take a breath?

823
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:43,722
I'm okay.

824
00:48:47,138 --> 00:48:49,929
I had a flip phone, man.

825
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,388
It like fucking creaked
when you opened it,

826
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,263
it went [Isabelle
imitating creaking]

827
00:48:53,346 --> 00:48:54,971
and it worked fine.

828
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:59,180
It fucking was fine. It
never told me what to do.

829
00:48:59,263 --> 00:49:00,096
You know?

830
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,430
[Isabelle sighs]

831
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:20,597
Are we gonna stand here...
and breathe?

832
00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:25,388
And you're gonna tell me
that I'm not a bad person

833
00:49:28,472 --> 00:49:29,346
and that I deserve to be okay.

834
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,555
Right?

835
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,013
You're not a bad person.

836
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:40,346
How do you know?

837
00:49:54,472 --> 00:49:59,013
Look, let me bring these in
and I'll like... come back down.

838
00:49:59,096 --> 00:49:59,888
Okay?

839
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:04,180
[footsteps]

840
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,929

[door creaks open]

843

[door closes]

844
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:11,263
Ya know I don't really know
what you're doing over there

845
00:51:11,346 --> 00:51:12,763
at that uh - that paper thing.

846
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:14,763
But I was trying to
tell Mom about it?

847
00:51:14,846 --> 00:51:16,804
I don't know how she's gonna be.

848
00:51:16,888 --> 00:51:18,388
I told her that you
wanted to see her,

849
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:20,096
but she still got
that pain in her back.

850
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,430
And I don't know, it's a...

851
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:25,263
Hey, how's that, uh,
phone working out?

852
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,221
[Dino and Mom chattering
in other room]

853
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:31,763
[Mom] Cha cha cha.

854
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:35,472
[Mom laughs]

855
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:37,305
[Isabelle sighs]

856
00:51:41,388 --> 00:51:43,929
[Mom laughs]

857
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,221
[Mom] What?

858
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:50,597
[Dino] I've got Izze
outside, she wants to say hi,

859
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,846
you know, she came over,
she's doing better...

860
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:54,721
[Mom] What's different,
with her? What's different?

861
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:56,263
[Dino] It's a good thing.

862
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,430
You know, she she's got her
whole life sorta worked out

863
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:59,305
- Vets, military...
- Ugh, God!

864
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:00,597
[Dino] No, no it's good.

865
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:02,597
No, it's it's a good
thing, it's good.

866
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:05,305
Let her dedicate herself.

867
00:52:12,513 --> 00:52:14,180
She came all the way out here.

868
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:15,472
Do it for me please. Would
you just go talk to her?

869
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:18,180
I dragged her all
the way out here.

870
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:20,346
[Mom] I'm - I'm too busy today...
you're enough, believe me...

871
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:29,055
[Mom] You're enough, you fill
my heart, it's all I need ok...

872
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:33,679
[Dino] She's standin
out there, just...

873
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:41,679
Sorry, kiddo she doesn't
want to see you right now.

874
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:42,971
Next time, okay?

875
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:46,430
[keys rattling]

876
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:52,763
[vehicle rumbling]

877
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:02,763
[Chris Hedges on Podcast] Well
we have to create, in essence,

878
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,388
walled communities, where
we nurture and protect

879
00:53:07,472 --> 00:53:10,596
those values, that
the wider society

880
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:11,388
are attempting to destroy.

881
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:19,013
As much as possible we have to
create parallel institutions

882
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:21,804
to sustain ourselves
and empower ourselves.

883
00:53:23,096 --> 00:53:25,013
And all of that will
be done locally.

884
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:30,013
Because when collapse comes,

885
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:31,554
we'll have to take
care of ourselves.

886
00:53:31,637 --> 00:53:36,596
That's why, you know,
food, local food markets,

887
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:41,596
sustainable agriculture,
sustainable energy.

888
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:46,055
You know, all of this becomes,
in moments of distress,

889
00:53:46,138 --> 00:53:48,180
these become political acts.

890
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,346
[fabric ripping]

891
00:54:08,637 --> 00:54:10,679
How you doing with this?

892
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,637
You doing all right?

893
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:14,846
You wanna hand with this?

894
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:16,721
Gimme a sleeve,
I'll help you out.

895
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:18,263
[Kevin] Yeah,
pass me some, too.

896
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:19,512
[scissors snipping]

897
00:54:19,596 --> 00:54:21,512
What's the story
with this uniform?

898
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:22,430
What was the last
time you wore it?

899
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:35,346
It was checkpoint.

900
00:54:36,637 --> 00:54:38,263
[uniform ripping]

901
00:54:39,055 --> 00:54:40,221
in Youssoufia.

902
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:43,721
I was out there so fucking
long, I don't even know.

903
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,471
Days, nights, weeks,
[scissors snipping]

904
00:54:49,554 --> 00:54:50,971
just out there in the heat,

905
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,596
staring down a highway.

906
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,471
A hundred hours of heat
goes by with nothing.

907
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,013
And then a car comes
out of nowhere.

908
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:04,180
[suspenseful music rising]

909
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:06,846
our CO told us there's
only one way to tell,

910
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,013
[fabric ripping]

911
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:10,679
the good guys from the bad guys.

912
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:16,471
The bad guys don't stop.

913
00:55:19,554 --> 00:55:23,596
We'd fire, and we'd
walk up to the vehicle,

914
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,096
[Isabelle breathing deeply]

915
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,679
and almost every single time,

916
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:35,846
there was nothing, there
were no explosives.

917
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:37,471
There were no weapons.

918
00:55:43,804 --> 00:55:45,388
And we kept trying
to figure it out

919
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:47,180
what the fuck was going on?

920
00:55:48,096 --> 00:55:50,263
Why don't they fucking stop?

921
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:56,596
I know in our AO,
we covered everything

922
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:57,388
between Ramadi and Fallujah,

923
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,096
almost to Abu Ghraib,
we were over there

924
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,637
when the photos got leaked,

925
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:06,055
all of a sudden word's
out on the street,

926
00:56:06,138 --> 00:56:09,387
every Iraqi knows that we're
torturing the shit out of them.

927
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:13,263
I don't blame them for not
stopping at the checkpoint.

928
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:15,263
They thought that
we might arrest them

929
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,471
and send them to Abu Ghraib too.

930
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,637
We never never get the story
from the Iraqi's perspective.

931
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,180
[scissors snipping]

932
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:25,346
Some foreign military
was on my street?

933
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:31,346
You know how that would go,
here in the US.

934
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:33,429
Red Dawn in every town.

935
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,055
Red Dawn in every town.

936
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:37,512
Guilt and shame...

937
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:42,138
are pretty fucking heavy
to carry with you.

938
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:46,345
World War II vets didn't
come back and kill themselves

939
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:49,429
in these kinds of
numbers, right?

940
00:56:49,512 --> 00:56:50,637
They had a clear mission.

941
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:52,138
They knew who they
were fighting.

942
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:55,013
They believed in their purpose.

943
00:56:59,055 --> 00:57:01,263
It didn't take me
very long to realize

944
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:04,971
that there was nothing
there for me to believe in.

945
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:08,013
[scissors cutting]

946
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:11,013
In this bullshit
war, who's proud?

947
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,305
I'm proud I survived.

948
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:18,929
Yeah, proud of doing this.

949
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:21,971
[scissors cutting]

950
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:26,929
Take a lot of pride in how
many uniforms I've cut up.

951
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:29,096
[chuckling]

952
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,888
Wonder what kind of uniforms
will be cutting up in 10 years?

953
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:32,971
You know, what color
are those going to be?

954
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:33,596
Spacesuits.

955
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,512
Spacesuits [laughs].

956
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:37,055
Spaceforce!

957
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:39,554
Tinfoil and goddamn nylon.

958
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:42,055
You guys are startin to sound
like a couple of Commies over here

959
00:57:42,138 --> 00:57:43,013
I don't give a fuck, I'll say it

960
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:46,013
We'll be up there fighting
space ISIS, in orbit!

961
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:49,387
Space ISIS, there you go.

962
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:53,263
Coming home from a
war that you don't feel

963
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:56,387
morally justified
being a part of...

964
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,763
is not easy to live with.

965
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:04,596
Especially if you drank the
Kool-Aid all along... then have

966
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:09,679
to wake up to that one day
and realize that instead of

967
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,429
being one of the Jedi, we
were the Storm Troopers.

968
00:58:13,888 --> 00:58:16,262
[dramatic tone]

969
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:26,138
[pulp pouring out]

970
00:58:28,429 --> 00:58:29,554
[lid closing]

971
00:58:29,637 --> 00:58:33,763
Find out that my bags
are lost on the airline

972
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:36,262
and all I got's my
Black Sabbath t-shirt.

973
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:37,429
[laughs]

974
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:39,180
So next morning I
show up to formation.

975
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:41,055
Sergeant comes out and he goes,

976
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:43,512
"What the fuck are you doing?"

977
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:44,471
I don't have my uniforms.

978
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,055
He said, all right
Ozzy, just get down

979
00:58:47,138 --> 00:58:48,429
and start pushing.

980
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:49,763
- [laughs]
- Ozzy...

981
00:58:49,846 --> 00:58:51,220
Moment of truth.

982
00:58:51,304 --> 00:58:54,596
Hey, have you guys seen
Will in the past couple weeks?

983
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:56,220
Nah, not really.

984
00:58:56,304 --> 00:58:57,220
It's been a while.

985
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:00,055
Think he went upstate?

986
00:59:00,138 --> 00:59:00,429
To his dad's place?

987
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:06,055
Yeah, probably hiding out in
the bunker for a little bit.

988
00:59:06,138 --> 00:59:08,096
I could use some time
chilling in the bunker,

989
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:08,929
out of the city.

990
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:11,096
It's a nice spot, too.

991
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,345
You been up there yet?

992
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:14,971
No, it's near where my
parents are from though.

993
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,471
I know the town.

994
00:59:19,804 --> 00:59:20,471
Will, what's up?

995
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:21,345
It's Nate.

996
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:24,262
I don't know if you got
my last message, but...

997
00:59:24,345 --> 00:59:27,763
just calling to see
how you're doing.

998
00:59:28,846 --> 00:59:33,220
It's been busy, we
made a hell of a mess.

999
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:37,262
So maybe it's good you're
gone, but I don't know.

1000
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,971
Calling to see how you're doing.

1001
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:42,888
Yeah, man. Hope you're well.

1002
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:44,262
Hit us up,. Peace.

What you doing out
this late, huh?

1012
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:40,596
Whoa, whoa!

1013
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:44,262
Hey look, I got her, Nick

1014
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,554
I got the Marine
[laughs]

1015
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:48,262
C'mon, try and get out.

1016
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:49,721
Come on.

1017
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:51,637
Come on.

1018
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:53,554
Is that the best you got?

1019
01:00:53,637 --> 01:00:54,262
I'm barely even holding on.

1020
01:00:54,345 --> 01:00:55,929
Come on soldier!

1021
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:57,055
Come on. [laughs]

1022
01:00:57,846 --> 01:00:59,179
Why you go so easy on me?

1023
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:03,095
Yo, we're heading to Claude's
if you wanna come.

1025
01:01:04,137 --> 01:01:04,888
No?

1026
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:06,554
All right.

Hey.

1038
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:53,845
I am... sorry. [grunting]

1039
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:55,095
I'm sorry.

1040
01:05:55,179 --> 01:05:55,928
You okay?

1041
01:05:56,012 --> 01:05:56,803
Me?

1042
01:05:57,512 --> 01:05:59,345
I'm, yeah, are you okay?

1043
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:04,763
I almost got fucking
sideswiped by this pickup truck

1044
01:06:04,845 --> 01:06:05,637
coming up here.

1045
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:08,262
Fucking Confederate
flag hanging.

1046

01:25:12,802 --> 01:25:15,094
There's so much
and I can't say it.

1225
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:20,927
I have threshold, man.

1226
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:23,802
I have a threshold.

1227
01:25:24,511 --> 01:25:26,094
That's all I'm saying.

1228
01:25:27,844 --> 01:25:29,677
What's your threshold?

1229
01:25:35,178 --> 01:25:37,178
[sound of Will sitting down]

1230
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:39,178
Timothy,

1231
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,470
Last time we talked together,

1232
01:25:42,553 --> 01:25:45,511
told me about this woman
in a hardware store...

1233
01:25:47,303 --> 01:25:50,677
apron... selling him something,

1234
01:25:50,761 --> 01:25:51,886
who...

1235
01:25:53,011 --> 01:25:56,761
thanked him for his service.

1236
01:25:58,844 --> 01:26:03,886
How he doesn't blame her, but...
he's so fucking confused.

1237
01:26:08,094 --> 01:26:11,219
Are you thanking me for
killing people in Sadr City

1238
01:26:11,303 --> 01:26:13,178
who were just -
driving down the road?

1239
01:26:15,094 --> 01:26:17,428
Or how about for ripping a
man in Samarra away

1240
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:18,428
from his family?

1241
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:22,344
humiliating him,
detaining him,

1242
01:26:24,136 --> 01:26:25,761
starving him,
torturing him,

1243
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:27,303
thousands and thousands of him?

1244
01:26:28,553 --> 01:26:30,553
Are you thanking me
for blowing up a school

1245
01:26:30,635 --> 01:26:32,719
or for blowing up
a hospital?

1246
01:26:34,511 --> 01:26:38,261
Are you thanking me for
slaughtering a family in Mahmudiya?

1247
01:26:40,386 --> 01:26:43,886
Maybe you're thanking me
for collateral murder.

1248
01:26:45,428 --> 01:26:49,094
For SOP 360 rotational
fire on an entire village

1249
01:26:49,178 --> 01:26:51,011
in response to an IED.

1250
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:53,303
Or you feel some gratitude

1251
01:26:53,386 --> 01:26:56,594
that we protected the interests
of Exxon - and laid down

1252
01:26:56,677 --> 01:27:01,136
our lives for Halliburton or
quadrupled profits for Raytheon.

1253
01:27:01,219 --> 01:27:03,594
Could you be thanking me for
Abu Ghraib?

1254
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,761
or just for taking the pictures?

1255
01:27:07,094 --> 01:27:10,552
No... you're thanking
me for the kill count.

1256
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:14,178
200,000 dead civilians.

1257
01:27:15,344 --> 01:27:16,927
Or is it "thank you
for the drone strikes"

1258
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:21,969
that destroyed Mosul, Ramadi,
Aleppo, Baghdad, Rakka...

1259
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:26,303
Thank you for MST?

1260
01:27:26,386 --> 01:27:28,552
For burn pits?

1261
01:27:28,635 --> 01:27:32,053
Maybe I should thank you for standing
by while it was all happening.

1262
01:27:32,136 --> 01:27:34,594
I mean, I know you're not
thanking me for being a hero.

1263
01:27:34,677 --> 01:27:36,344
I was a pawn.

1264
01:27:43,969 --> 01:27:44,761
Anyway.

1265
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:48,470
That's what I would've said.

1266
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:54,178
I would never say all that.

1267
01:27:56,594 --> 01:27:57,886
That's what his death said.

1268
01:28:00,469 --> 01:28:01,761
A final fuck you.

1269
01:28:03,136 --> 01:28:04,886
All of them, just sitting there.

1270
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:08,469
They don't even know
they're watching him die.

1271
01:28:12,552 --> 01:28:15,552
It's just the proportions
are off, you know?

1272
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,761
Like why am I carrying
all this shit?

1273
01:28:20,344 --> 01:28:22,969
You'll never see a recruiter
in the Upper West Side.

1274
01:28:26,011 --> 01:28:27,094
Fuck it.

1275
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,261
[sound of Will getting
up, walking away]

1276
01:28:31,552 --> 01:28:33,886
Three cheers for
the American dream.

1277
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:37,927
The whole goddamn
world's nightmare, but...

1278
01:28:38,469 --> 01:28:40,094
our dream.

1279
01:28:42,053 --> 01:28:44,844
[birds chirping, stream flowing]

1280
01:29:26,635 --> 01:29:30,261
[crickets and fire crackling]

1281
01:30:07,303 --> 01:30:08,094
What?

1282
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:12,677
What the fuck man?

1283
01:30:14,343 --> 01:30:17,761
Nothing, I'm just
fucking with you.

1284
01:30:19,343 --> 01:30:21,219
I just wanted to do one of
those war movie moments,

1285
01:30:21,303 --> 01:30:23,594
you know, where the
veterans like, oh fuck,

1286
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:26,594
I'm going back there, and then
he like freaks the fuck out.

1287
01:30:29,094 --> 01:30:31,094
Some dude army crawling
at his kid's birthday

1288
01:30:31,178 --> 01:30:32,802
when a balloon pops.

1289
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:34,469
Incoming!

1290
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:36,385
[laughs]

1291
01:30:45,635 --> 01:30:46,343
I hate those fucking movies.

1292
01:30:48,302 --> 01:30:49,302
Yep.

1293
01:30:49,385 --> 01:30:51,427
Fuck American Sniper.

1294
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:52,094
Fuck Hurt Locker.

1295
01:30:52,178 --> 01:30:54,719
Fuck Zero Dark Thirty.

1296
01:30:54,802 --> 01:30:57,761
Especially fuck
Saving Private Ryan.

1297
01:30:57,844 --> 01:31:00,594
Fuckin ra ra military bullshit.

1298
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:01,802
Good War bullshit.

1299
01:31:01,886 --> 01:31:03,469
Like there can be a good one.

1300
01:31:04,011 --> 01:31:05,385
Fuck that.

1301
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:14,677
[crickets]

1302
01:31:20,136 --> 01:31:21,302
Yo check this out.

1303
01:31:22,802 --> 01:31:24,719
This is the outer material
for a sleeping bag.

1304
01:31:26,802 --> 01:31:31,260
Doesn't have any date on it,
but I think it's like - Fifties?

1305
01:31:31,343 --> 01:31:32,469
maybe even Forties?

1306
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,053
It was the rain cover.

1307
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,844
Keeps everything out.

1308
01:31:42,552 --> 01:31:43,469
This would make some
awesome paper, but...

1309
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:48,260
It's also pretty fucking
awesome as it is, right?

1310
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,011
I don't know what to do with it.

1311
01:31:58,011 --> 01:31:58,802
What's up?

1312
01:32:03,136 --> 01:32:04,761
We gonna have a staring contest?

1313
01:32:12,178 --> 01:32:13,011
What is it?

1314
01:32:14,178 --> 01:32:16,927
Sorry, I'm sorry I
can't... fucking talk...

1315
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:19,927
Stop saying you're
fucking sorry, Jesus!

1316
01:32:23,969 --> 01:32:24,844
Come on, what is it?

1317
01:32:24,927 --> 01:32:25,260
Just... talk.

1318
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:29,594
You're not mad?

1319
01:32:30,927 --> 01:32:32,427
Does it look
like a mad at you?

1320
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:34,886
You're all here and
then you disappear,

1321
01:32:34,969 --> 01:32:36,594
you just left me there, man!

1322
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:38,343
I left because of my own shit.

1323
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:45,094
I know.

1324
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:50,469
I don't know what I
told you about him...

1325
01:32:52,302 --> 01:32:56,011
Yeah, you... you told me.

1326
01:32:58,177 --> 01:33:00,677
Okay.

1327
01:33:00,761 --> 01:33:01,927
I don't always remember.

1328
01:33:08,343 --> 01:33:10,594
You know what
you're doing, man.

1329
01:33:11,427 --> 01:33:14,385
You know how to be with people.

1330
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:16,469
You know how to be alone.

1331
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:19,260
You have it, I mean, I
want to know how you...

1332
01:33:21,177 --> 01:33:23,677
You make it look easy,
man, just being here!

1333
01:33:26,011 --> 01:33:28,594
Nothing about
this is easy, okay.

1334
01:33:28,677 --> 01:33:30,469
I don't know what you're seeing.

1335
01:33:31,427 --> 01:33:32,343
I don't have this down

1336
01:33:32,427 --> 01:33:34,552
to some kind of fucking science.

1337
01:33:34,635 --> 01:33:36,427
All right, I'm
making it up as I go.

1338
01:33:37,969 --> 01:33:40,677
I'm just trying everything I
can think of from one moment to

1339
01:33:40,761 --> 01:33:44,385
the next that doesn't
hurt anyone or hurt myself or,

1340
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:47,761
land me in some fucking abyss
where I just hate myself

1341
01:33:47,844 --> 01:33:48,427
to fucking death, so.

1342
01:33:53,343 --> 01:33:55,343
You know how to live.

1343
01:33:57,677 --> 01:33:59,677
No. I really don't.

1344
01:34:11,011 --> 01:34:11,927
That's what I'm doing, man.

1345
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:15,469
I keep... It's like
sick, it's like,

1346
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:20,302
I keep trying to fucking find
someone and grab them and be like,

1347
01:34:21,594 --> 01:34:23,677
okay, show me how
to fucking live!

1348
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:31,844
Okay.

1349
01:34:31,927 --> 01:34:33,719
I'm catching on, all right.

1350
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:40,053
This body, this being - mine.

1351
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,135
Responsibility, mine!

1352
01:34:43,802 --> 01:34:44,594
Right?

1353
01:34:48,343 --> 01:34:49,969
Yeah, pretty much.

1354
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,635
[sobs] Fuck.

1355
01:34:58,802 --> 01:35:01,927
I wanna tear my fucking
skin off, man!

1356
01:35:02,011 --> 01:35:05,011
I fucking hate myself so much.

1357
01:35:07,343 --> 01:35:12,260
Fucking die, I hate
you, fucking die. [sobs]

1358
01:35:20,594 --> 01:35:20,635
I'm here.

1359
01:35:29,177 --> 01:35:31,469
I feel a lot for you.

1360
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:37,886
That's okay, isn't it?

1361
01:35:39,135 --> 01:35:40,927
I don't know.

1362
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:41,802
What?

1363
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:49,802
Maybe I came here to hurt you.

1364
01:35:56,427 --> 01:35:57,635
Everything hurts me.

1365
01:35:59,469 --> 01:36:00,469
There's nothing you
can do about it.

1366
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:17,093
I don't want to be bitter.

1367
01:36:17,177 --> 01:36:20,427
I don't want to live that way.

1368
01:36:23,093 --> 01:36:25,218
[sniffs]

1369
01:36:27,677 --> 01:36:29,469
That's what you know how to do.

1370
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:39,010
[wind chimes]

1371
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,927
I could barely walk across
those things with my boots on.

1372
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:48,677
Do you ever take
those boots off?

1373
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:49,052
Yeah.

1374
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:50,510
Yeah?

1375
01:36:50,594 --> 01:36:51,260
Yeah.

1376
01:36:51,343 --> 01:36:53,093
I take a shower sometimes.

1377
01:36:53,177 --> 01:36:53,927
Yeah right.

1378
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:54,802
Once a week at least.

1379
01:36:54,886 --> 01:36:56,302
That's very
attractive, that's dope.

1380
01:36:59,177 --> 01:37:00,761
I'm going to triple these up.

1381
01:37:00,844 --> 01:37:03,260
These are gonna be
strong motherfuckers.

1382
01:37:03,343 --> 01:37:04,218
All right?

1383
01:37:05,302 --> 01:37:06,677
I mean, I think double
is fine, but you know,

1384
01:37:06,761 --> 01:37:08,302
do you.

1385
01:37:10,177 --> 01:37:12,427
You're just putting
the - the birthday?

1386
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:13,968
You're not putting the...?

1387
01:37:14,677 --> 01:37:17,093
Nah.

1388
01:37:17,177 --> 01:37:17,926
It's cool.

1389
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:18,844
This is...

1390
01:37:21,343 --> 01:37:22,302
You know...

1391
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:23,552
Remember life.

1392
01:37:37,177 --> 01:37:38,343
Woods are like
outer space to me, man.

1393
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:54,635
[crickets]

1394
01:38:00,968 --> 01:38:02,677

1395
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:04,427

[calm music]

1398
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,343
Should I read it?

1399
01:39:12,427 --> 01:39:13,218
Yeah.

1400
01:39:14,677 --> 01:39:18,135
Marine cammies will be your
flesh, will be your pride.

1401
01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:19,926
My DI told me.

1402
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:22,594
Too baggy, too
long, don't matter.

1403
01:39:22,677 --> 01:39:24,385
You'll fill them,
you'll blend in.

1404
01:39:25,594 --> 01:39:27,552
Learn to kill silently.

1405
01:39:27,635 --> 01:39:29,427
Learn to kill screaming.

1406
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:31,343
Learn to take more
and more and more.

1407
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,885
Remove your uniform.

1408
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,010
It's been lying.

1409
01:39:36,093 --> 01:39:38,010
Remove it, cut it to pieces.

1410
01:39:38,093 --> 01:39:41,093
It's a lie, your
performance, your pride.

1411
01:39:41,177 --> 01:39:43,843
What tells me to kill,
who tells me to kill.

1412
01:39:45,218 --> 01:39:47,010
Hear the whispers
grow to shouting,

1413
01:39:47,093 --> 01:39:51,010
shouting from inside,
from that place begging no more,

1414
01:39:51,093 --> 01:39:54,177
shouting no more,
screaming no more.

1415
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:56,968
Shout what you already
know, what your new tribe

1416
01:39:57,052 --> 01:39:58,552
has come to know.

1417
01:39:58,635 --> 01:40:02,469
The world you once loved has
brought you to this place.

1418
01:40:02,552 --> 01:40:07,010
The world you once loved
never was, never will be.

1419
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:11,469
[footsteps]

1420
01:40:19,177 --> 01:40:22,343
[right-wing Radio voice]

1421
01:40:34,843 --> 01:40:36,677
Do you need something?

1422
01:40:40,135 --> 01:40:43,218
Just tell your
brother to come over.

1423
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:46,677
[Radio voice continues]

1424
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:53,052
I have to call Herbert
again about the sink.

1425
01:40:53,843 --> 01:40:57,010
Every fucking day with this guy.

1426
01:40:58,343 --> 01:41:02,177
At least your brother dropped
that what's her name, huh?

1427
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:05,510
Did he?

1428
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:07,469
You would know.

1429
01:41:14,594 --> 01:41:16,510
He's stealing my Tramadol.

1430
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:22,469
Either that or I'm
going fucking nuts.

You have no idea what

1433
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:38,218
Oh, that's your
father, always saying

1434
01:41:38,302 --> 01:41:40,052
"you have no idea what it's like

1435
01:41:40,135 --> 01:41:42,594
You have no idea what it's like"

1436
01:41:43,676 --> 01:41:44,760
You wouldn't remember.

1437
01:41:46,052 --> 01:41:46,343
You were too young.

1438
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,760
I have an idea of
what it's like.

1439
01:41:54,968 --> 01:41:55,302
[Radio] <i>we used to have the ten
commandments posted in our school rooms...</i>

almighty has said, thou shalt not murder...</i>

1441
01:42:03,594 --> 01:42:04,469
You see this?

1442
01:42:04,552 --> 01:42:06,093
You see this on my skin?

1443
01:42:12,427 --> 01:42:14,302
I can't stop taking this shit.

1444
01:42:15,177 --> 01:42:17,177
[distant police sirens]

1445
01:42:23,594 --> 01:42:24,510
Look at me.

1446
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,343
[sighs] You have no idea...

1447
01:42:30,093 --> 01:42:31,676
The people I work with...

1448
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:36,427
they think I'm contagious.

1449
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:38,302
[laughs]

1450
01:42:40,552 --> 01:42:44,093
And that nigger downstairs
keeps staring at me.

1451
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,260
He's nice.

1452
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:48,634
He smiles.

1453
01:42:49,843 --> 01:42:52,010
But why is he standing there?

1454
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:56,593
There's other places.

1455
01:42:57,718 --> 01:42:59,634
[sighs]

1456
01:42:59,718 --> 01:43:01,760
[dark tone]

1457
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:06,260
I didn't sleep again last night.

1458
01:43:07,343 --> 01:43:08,135
Just...

1459
01:43:09,135 --> 01:43:10,552
Just tell your
brother to come over!

1460
01:43:21,177 --> 01:43:24,052
[Everett] I bought a stool last
summer... for my birthday

1461
01:43:24,593 --> 01:43:25,302
and uh...

1462
01:43:26,302 --> 01:43:28,260
I bought a notebook, also...

1463
01:43:28,343 --> 01:43:32,551
And I bought a round trip bus ticket
to the Port Authority bus terminal.

1464
01:43:32,634 --> 01:43:36,093
I walked to the Veterans
Administration hospital.

1465
01:43:36,177 --> 01:43:38,968
The disability I was claiming

1466
01:43:39,052 --> 01:43:40,926
was post traumatic
stress disorder.

1467
01:43:42,469 --> 01:43:44,718
I was interviewed by a Veterans
Administration psychiatrist.

1468
01:43:46,302 --> 01:43:49,718
"Do you know that most Vietnam
veterans with your diagnosis

1469
01:43:49,801 --> 01:43:52,093
killed themselves
a long time ago?"

1470
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:58,343
At that time, 1970, 71... I was
experiencing brutal nightmares

1471
01:44:01,385 --> 01:44:02,551
every night,

1472
01:44:02,634 --> 01:44:04,093
night after night,
week after week,

1473
01:44:04,177 --> 01:44:05,302
I would wake up screaming,

1474
01:44:07,385 --> 01:44:09,469
fighting demons and ghosts.

1475
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:10,760
[fabric ripping]

1476
01:44:10,843 --> 01:44:11,509
[siren wailing]

1477
01:44:11,593 --> 01:44:13,427
And that psychiatrist told me

1478
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:15,801
it was only going to get worse.

1479
01:44:18,843 --> 01:44:22,926
At that time... I was
having terrible depressions.

1480
01:44:24,469 --> 01:44:27,385
In hindsight, I would say...
I was close to being catatonic.

1481
01:44:29,343 --> 01:44:31,926
It took everything I had,
to put my feet over the edge

1482
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:34,760
of the bed in the morning
and to stand up like a man.

1483
01:44:37,093 --> 01:44:39,302
And that psychiatrist told me

1484
01:44:39,385 --> 01:44:41,260
it was only going to get worse.
Never better.

1485
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:46,052
[Eli] One of the first lessons
I had to learn as a medic

1486
01:44:46,135 --> 01:44:48,010
was that in order
to treat the wound,

1487
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,260
first we have to expose it.

1488
01:44:50,343 --> 01:44:53,343
That body armer that
used to protect you,

1489
01:44:54,634 --> 01:44:56,218
that camouflage that was
supposed to hide you.

1490
01:44:57,218 --> 01:44:58,302
Now it's just
getting in the way.

1491
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:04,427
At that time...

1492
01:45:04,509 --> 01:45:06,343
the single biggest thing
in my mind was suicide.

1493
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:09,427
It was not where,
it was not how,

1494
01:45:11,177 --> 01:45:11,385
it was only when.

1495
01:45:13,302 --> 01:45:14,926
Tonight. Tomorrow.

1496
01:45:15,676 --> 01:45:18,343
Just when.

1497
01:45:18,343 --> 01:45:20,968
I could not cross
a railroad track

1498
01:45:21,052 --> 01:45:22,426
without thinking of stopping

1499
01:45:22,509 --> 01:45:24,093
and putting my head on the rail.

1500
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:29,260
I could not cross a high bridge

1501
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:31,260
[fabric ripping]

1502
01:45:31,343 --> 01:45:33,926
I probably spent 1000 hours on
the George Washington bridge,

1503
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,385
pacing back and forth.

1504
01:45:36,468 --> 01:45:40,177
And that psychiatrist told me
it was only going to get worse,

1505
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:42,260
never better.

1506
01:45:47,177 --> 01:45:48,676
So now. About 44 years later.

1507
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,218
About 44 years later.

1508
01:45:51,302 --> 01:45:52,926
Another psychiatrist tells me

1509
01:45:54,509 --> 01:45:56,926
do you know that most Vietnam
veterans with your diagnosis

1510
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:59,177
killed themselves
a long time ago?

1511
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:02,384
As I thought of him, a
little poem came to my mind.

1512
01:46:05,676 --> 01:46:06,426
You called me monster.

1513
01:46:08,509 --> 01:46:11,218
You cornered me and trapped me.

1514
01:46:12,468 --> 01:46:16,968
You forced me to chew my leg
off... and to hobble

1515
01:46:17,052 --> 01:46:18,426
from one suicidal
day to the next.

1516
01:46:21,634 --> 01:46:22,676
It don't mean nothing.

1517
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:26,135
[Eli] ...that's great, you
wanna bring the troops home...

1518
01:46:26,218 --> 01:46:27,760
that's the campaign
you're runnin on?

1519
01:46:27,843 --> 01:46:29,676
Cool, we got a plan
to help you with that,

1520
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,801
because we're the troops who've
been there, and done that....

1521
01:46:34,384 --> 01:46:36,177
And the cops, you know,
it's the middle of summer,

1522
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:37,343
the cops are in
full battle rattle,

1523
01:46:39,343 --> 01:46:43,093
much fancier gear than we had,
in Iraq.

1524
01:46:43,177 --> 01:46:44,302
And they were hot as shit.

1525
01:46:44,384 --> 01:46:45,843
You could tell they
were miserable,

1526
01:46:45,926 --> 01:46:47,760
sweating.

1527
01:46:49,509 --> 01:46:53,718
And so we were talking directly
to the cops - tellin 'em, look

1528
01:46:53,801 --> 01:46:55,260
we know what y'all
are dealing with.

1529
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:56,885
We been out there in the
heat and all this gear too,

1530
01:46:56,968 --> 01:46:59,426
it sucks, doesn't it?

1531
01:46:59,509 --> 01:47:01,926
You should just go home, cause...
you don't really need to be here

1532
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:03,843
doing this shit with us.

1533
01:47:03,926 --> 01:47:05,509
[guitar playing]

1534
01:47:05,593 --> 01:47:09,093
Anyway, a couple of them
ended up walking off the line.

1535
01:47:09,177 --> 01:47:10,260
And... whole front rank of vets,

1536
01:47:10,342 --> 01:47:12,509
all in dress uniform,
carrying flags.

1537
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:15,593
They stepped off and said,
I'm not going to like,

1538
01:47:15,676 --> 01:47:20,093
I'm not going to go beat a bunch
of fucking veterans carrying flags.

1539
01:47:22,384 --> 01:47:24,010
They weren't going to do it.

1540
01:47:24,093 --> 01:47:26,926
We kept telling them... we're going
to advance, we're going to advance.

1541
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:28,968
And we kept advancing slowly.

1542
01:47:29,052 --> 01:47:32,885
[Nate] Yeah, but we kept
saying we're unarmed

1543
01:47:32,968 --> 01:47:35,843
and we're here to
make a statement.

1544
01:47:36,676 --> 01:47:38,426
Hundreds of us there.

1545
01:47:39,676 --> 01:47:40,926
[Eli] So after
the long standoff,

1546
01:47:41,010 --> 01:47:43,177
they did end up
letting two of them in.

1547
01:47:44,551 --> 01:47:47,052
And they presented it and his
military affairs guy was like

1548
01:47:47,135 --> 01:47:49,426
Hey, this is a solid plan.

1549
01:47:49,509 --> 01:47:51,177
We want to talk to you
guys further about this.

1550
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,843
Let's implement this
into our policy.

1551
01:47:55,384 --> 01:47:58,676
So. We thought everything's
good, the cops called it off.

1552
01:47:58,760 --> 01:47:59,468
Everybody was cheering, hugging.

1553
01:48:01,801 --> 01:48:03,718
And then we packed up
and went to the RNC

1554
01:48:03,801 --> 01:48:06,760
to try to do the same thing,
not nearly as successful there.

1555
01:48:08,968 --> 01:48:09,968
And you know the rest of the
story from there, you know?

1556
01:48:10,052 --> 01:48:11,926
Obama gets elected

1557
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:12,885
the left goes to sleep

1558
01:48:12,968 --> 01:48:13,968
the war continues on

1559
01:48:14,052 --> 01:48:15,509
and here we are.

1560
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,801
...go up on the
left just a touch...?

1561
01:48:18,843 --> 01:48:19,509
