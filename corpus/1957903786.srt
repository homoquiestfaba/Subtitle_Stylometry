(upbeat music)

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,305
- Hey.

4
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,008
He is coming.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,509
Hey, he is coming!

6
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,443
He is coming!

7
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,633
- Website.

8
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,646
(cat meows)

9
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,554
(keyboards clacking)

10
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,860
- Oh, he gonna get it.

11
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,962

00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,068

(phone buzzing)

14
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,639
- Oh, no, no.

15
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:55,943
I'm not exactly
running late to work.

16
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,847
I am more doing
some work from home.

17
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,249
- Working from home?

18
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,586
We're not working from
home anymore, Laz.

19
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,157
- Sorry.

20
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,792
- We're all here in
this great big building

21
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,226
where you like to come and
sit for eight hours a day.

22
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,765
And every other week, we're
forced by law to give you money

23
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,467
because you graced us
with your presence.

24
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,937
- I understand, I'm so sorry.

25
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,306
Oh, I'm on my way
right now, Ms. Wright.

26
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,043
- What did you just say to me?

27
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,412
Because it sounded like
you said "gone guy pray,"

28
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,550
and you'd better be on your
hands and knees praying or...

29
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,419
If you think you can get
away with mocking me,

30
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,458
have I got news for you!

31
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,763
- No, no, ma'am, I
would never mock you.

32
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,633
I have nothing but the
utmost respect for you.

33
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:57,805
Chloe, honey, what are you...

34
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:00,240
(laughs) Hey, Chloe, honey?

35
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,309
What in the world's going on?

36
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,645
- Just what it looks
like, Mr. Coding Genius.

37
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:08,149
I'm dumping off things
you had at my place

38
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,254
and picking up things
I have here at yours.

39
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,157
- No, I...

40
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:21,529
I get that, but if I
didn't know any better,

41
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:24,165
I'd think you were
breaking up with me.

42
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,166
- Lazarus!

43
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,935
Lazarus, are you
listening to me?

44
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,106
- Yes, yes, ma'am, you
are correct, 100% correct.

45
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,273
- See, right there.

46
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,710
You have no spine, no ambition.

47
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,477
You're going nowhere, Laz.

48
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:40,615
Fight for your job,
for your talents.

49
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:46,087
- I understand, it
won't happen again.

50
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,557
- And mister, if you don't
get to the office soon,

51
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,594
you can forget about having any
breaks for at least a month.

52
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:57,965
- But, but, but, baby,
that's for our smoochie time.

53
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:07,440
So, you know, I've been looking
forward to our first kiss.

54
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,476
- Yeah, me too, sweetie.

55
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,282
- Everything okay?

56
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,083
- Yeah.

57
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:18,719
Um.

58
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,891
- It's kind of hard
to see without those.

59
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,259
- Little better.

60
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,765
(laughs)

61
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,903
How about before smoochie
time, how about we...

62
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,914
How about you, we
freshen up a little bit?

63
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,117
- Okay.

64
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,554
(laughs) No, you have to.

65
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:54,421
- Okay.

66
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,526
Not anymore.

67
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,062
- Smoochie time?

68
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,098
I hope you just got hit in
the head with a sledgehammer

69
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,633
because there is no world

70
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,136
where I'm gonna be seen
with you at smoochie time.

71
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,306
- No, no, no, not
you, never, no, sorry.

72
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,342
- What do you mean, you'd never?

73
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,177
Let me tell you, Lazarus,

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,946
I find your comments
highly offensive.

75
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,414
Whenever I was your
age, I had a job.

76
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,351
I had already bought a house.

77
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,319
I worked my tail off.

78
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,622
I worked 10 hours a day
instead of eight hours.

79
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,990
- Please stop.

80
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,157
- Stop?

81
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,594
Oh boy, I'm just
getting started, mister.

82
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,096
I arrived to work on time.

83
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,064
I was a professional and
could get the job done.

84
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,033
Professionals come in to
work and they're not late.

85
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,769
- See, you're about to
blow another opportunity

86
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,205
all because of your stupid app.

87
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,606
- I know it doesn't
look like much now,

88
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,942
but my app could
help people, Chloe.

89
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,409
- Except you and me.

90
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,412
Laz, you don't even know
how to make it, make money.

91
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,982
Do I look like
the type of person

92
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,351
who wants to be broke
all of her life?

93
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,153

97

- Um, let me think.

143
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,931
She did mutter something
about some loser

144
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,868
who kept his dirty underwear
in the back of her car

145

- Yeah.

150
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,543
She didn't say
anything else like...

151
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,579
Like "Oh, Lazarus,
I still love you"

152
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,682
or like "Oh, Laz, we'll
get back together."

153
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,151
Something like that?

154
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,421
- None of those words were
said by anybody in this area.

155

- Great, that's great.

156
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,957
- But I could use
your assistance.

157
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,059
- Okay, um...

158
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,961
- [Jesus] Jesus.

159
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,531
- Huh?

160
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,864

- Yeah.

of God, our savior?

163
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,106
- Yeah, the one in the same.

164
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,375
- Okay, Jesus, right, okay.

165
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,777
Well, Je...

166
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,113
You're not meaning
like Jesus, are you?

167
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,949
- No, no, just plain ole' Jesus.

168

169
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:48,289

- Um, I'm sorry, "Lazarus of
the 918", helping the Jesus?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, that's it.

yeah, yeah, steel pan drummer.

174

175
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,408
You guys hide those so well.

176
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,377

00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:15,950
He actually gets
a kick out of it.

180
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,952
Especially those like
synchronized dance videos

181
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,020
where everyone is like...

182
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,690
I think they're dumb, he
thinks they're a hoot.

183
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:27,728
- (laughs) Do you want to
go somewhere else to talk?

184
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,266
I can't afford people
thinking I'm crazy.

185
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,535
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:36,871
- Sure, where did
you have in mind?

187
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,672
- My apartment is just
like right down the...

188
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,241
Are you sure you're
not going to like rob

189
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:43,777
and like send me to
the great beyond?

190
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:44,745
- No, man!

191
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm Jesus.

192
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,451
And I checked, you still
have plenty of time left.

193
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,522
- (sighs) Just
make it a surprise.

194
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:54,421
Come on.

195
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:56,157
- Make it a surprise?

196
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,160
- Don't look at them!

197
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:06,200
Sandals off, please.

198
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,870
- I can see why you
were so concerned

199
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:13,240
about someone wanting to
steal all your things.

200
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,675
- It's a work in progress, okay?

201
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,277
So just how am I
supposed to help you?

202
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,579
- I don't know yet.

203
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:18,946
My first job was to find you

204
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,616
and now we just wait for a sign.

205
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,752
- (laughs) Signs, okay,
I got some signs for you.

206
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:25,953
I was dumped.

207
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,288
I was just fired.

208
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,757
And oh yeah, I met Jesus.

209
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,059
So, there's a sign for you.

210
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,029
- I guess now we get
to hang out, you know.

211
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:35,996
Get to know each other.

212
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,498
- Okay, hang on, wait.

213
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:38,732
I thought you only came back
for like the end of times.

214
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,334
You know, to judge everyone.

215
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,435
- Judge everyone?

216
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,771
I mean, I guess I can do that.

217
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,606
Here we go.

218
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,473
Good, good, bad, good.

219
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,009
He should be in jail.

220
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,579
- Okay, I thought you were
Jesus, not Santa Claus.

221
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:53,147
Do I need to be worried about
the end of the world or what?

222
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,882
- Oh, no, no.

223
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,016
You don't have to
worry about that.

224
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,185
We have plenty of time.

225
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,920
- Plenty of time.

226
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:02,756
So then why are you
here, if you're Jesus?

227
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,825
- I come down to
earth all the time.

228
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,961
Although it's been a while
since I've been to the States.

229
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:10,297
Last time I went to
DC, ugh, never again.

230
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,266
- I hear that a lot.

231
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,703
I must have really messed
up to get Jesus down here.

232
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,071
- No, it's not like that at all.

233
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,939
You possess something special.

234
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:20,741
It's a skill or a purpose.

235
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,811
You just don't know
what it is yet.

236
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,580
- I wish Chloe heard that!

237
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:29,283
- We'll only know the mission
when it becomes clear.

238
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,852
- Okay, well, I've got
nothing else going on,

239
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,287
so I guess I'm...

240
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,657
Guess I'm helping Jesus.

241
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,157
- Yeah, that's what
I want to hear.

242
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,892
Well, let's get started.

243
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,329
First things first,
let's order a pizza, huh?

244
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,298
- Pizza, really?

245
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,833
No, no, no.

246
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,768
Okay, now first we need to do
something about those clothes.

247
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,205
How are you wearing a
tunic in this weather?

248
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,108
- It, you get used to it.

249
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,910
- Okay, well, after the
clothes, we gotta get a job.

250
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:57,746
- Job?

251
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,413
- Yeah, rent, pizza.

252
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:01,849
All that takes money.

253
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,185
And I'm going to get real tired
of fish, loaves, and wine.

254
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,756
- That's two very
different situations.

255
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,758
- Okay, and after the clothes,

256
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,560
we gotta do something
about your hair.

257
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:13,728
- Nothing major, right?

258
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:14,928
Just a little?

259
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,263
I mean, I know I have
a few split ends,

260
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,666
but just a little off the edge,

261
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,999
kind of square everything out?

262
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,401
- [Laz] We'll see, I know a guy.

263
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,435
- Laz?

264
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,436
Laz!

265
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,470

You're going to help
me with my social media

319
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,551
in exchange for helping
your friend out today?

320
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,385
What was his name anyway?

321
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,352
- His name?

322
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,322
- [Jane] Yeah.

323
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,058
- Um, his name is
Jees, uh, okay.

324
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,162
- Jees?

325
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,030
Jees.

326
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,602
- Hi, I'm so sorry
to bother you,

327
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,838
but she saw you
from across the room

328
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,907
and, well, she just
wouldn't stop asking

329
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:15,543
until I let her come
over and say hi to you.

330
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:17,077
- It's quite all right.

331
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,111
Hi!

332
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,582
(mom coughs)

333
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,217
That's all right.

334
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,452
- I know who you are.

335
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,055
- I know who you
are too, Lillie.

336
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,791
What can I do for you?

337
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:31,960
- My mommy has cancer,

338
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,094
and I was hoping you
would pray with us

339
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,663
to help her not have it anymore.

340
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,097
- Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

341
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,801
I had no idea that
that's what she wanted

342
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,301
to talk to you about.

343
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,605
- It's quite all right.

344
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:47,407
What are the doctors saying
about your prognosis?

345
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,244
- They're very optimistic.

346
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,646
- You should be too.

347
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,649
I also have a good
feeling about it.

348
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,450
But, uh, I think
Lillie is right.

349
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,486
I think we should
all pray together.

350
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,695
Dear Lord, our heavenly father,

351
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,631
please hear Lillie's prayer.

352
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:10,497
Go ahead.

353
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:15,269
- Dear Lord, please help
make my mommy well again,

354
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,773
so we can play and
enjoy everything mommies

355
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,074
and kids are supposed to.

356
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,310
I would do anything
for that, Lord.

357
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:27,549
Clean my room, be nice
to my little brother,

358
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,082
whatever it takes.

359
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,021
- Dear Lord, please
answer Lillie's prayers

360
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,822
and the prayers of all
the other families looking

361
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,424
for your comforting assurance.

362
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,325
Amen.

363
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,794
- Amen.
- Amen.

364
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,429
(laughs)

365
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,197
- You're a brave
little girl, Lillie.

366
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,265
- [Lillie] Thank you.

367
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,534
- And I have a good feeling

368
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:49,804
that your prayers are
going to get answered.

369
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,039
- You know what?

370
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,107
I'm not sure why,
but I think so too.

371
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:58,145
Thank you.

372
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:06,119
- What just happened in there?

373
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,221
And don't you think
that goes and proves

374
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,058
that you're "The Jesus".

375
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,793
- What, you mean Lillie?

376
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:14,161
- (laughs) Yes, little
girl coming up to you

377
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,263
and asking for you
to pray for her mom?

378
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,600
That stuff only happens
in scary movies.

379
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,466
- What?

380
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:22,870
Relax.

381
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,238
Haven't you prayed
for someone before?

382
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,507
- Well, okay, yeah,

383
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,042
but not in the middle
of having my haircut.

384
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,612
That stuff is supposed to
be done in private, okay?

385
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,279
- What do you mean, in private?

386
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,715
- I don't know,

387
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:34,916
you could have gone
outside around the corner,

388
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,317
or, I don't know,
gone to the restroom.

389
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,654
Just not in front of
God and everybody else.

390
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,254
- (laughs) I'm sorry, all right?

391
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,057
Next time a little
girl comes up to me

392
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,859
and asks me to pray
for her sick mother,

393
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,761
I'll make sure we run
into the broom closet

394
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,395
so we don't embarrass you.

395
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,262
- Okay.

396
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,535
- Oh, Lazarus, that was so good.

397
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,904
Thank you.

398
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,973
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

399
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,908
- So what do we do now?

400
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,645
- We sleep.

401
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:07,715
- But what about our purpose?

402
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,984
- [Laz] Um, yeah, tomorrow.

403
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,287
Tomorrow we'll go to
this pastor I know.

404
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,958
- And you're sure
this guy can help us?

405
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:17,925
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,293
If anyone can, he's the man.

407
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,798
- So this man-

408
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:24,666
- Can!

409
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,236
- You believe this
man is a man of faith?

410
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,838
- Yeah, he's a good guy.

411
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:34,809
Um, his dad was actually
the pastor before him.

412
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:42,650
Jesus!

413
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,486
Jesus, come on, you
can't do that to a guy.

414
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:48,723
- I'm sorry, I hope
I didn't scare you.

415
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,658
A lot of people think this
complexion comes naturally,

416
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,727
but it actually
takes a bit of work.

417
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,128
A lot of people are
surprised by that.

418
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:56,229
- Heart attacks
come naturally too.

419
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,665
- Hey, is it cool if I use this?

420
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:00,134
- No, no, that's Chloe...

421
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:01,069
Smoochie time.

422
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:02,670
- Smoochie Time?

423
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:05,039
That sounds like a
fun game, can we play?

424
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,074
- No.

425
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,910
Never, not with you, no.

426
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:11,145
You can use this
one if you want.

427
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,479
- All right.
- All right, bye.

428
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,581
- Thank you, Laz.

429
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:14,749
- [Laz] Uh huh.

430
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:15,750
- What an odd duck.

431
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,018
- I heard that!

432
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,657
Hey, um, Jesus, I
have had a long day.

433
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:28,096
A lot of emotional upheavals.

434
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:31,231
So why don't we call it a night

435
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:34,102
and start on this
mission of yours

436
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,404
first thing tomorrow morning?

437
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:40,141
- You're probably right.

438
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:43,611
(laughs) I am bushed.

439
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,012
Yeah, it takes a lot of effort

440
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:47,615
to ride around in
that vehicle of yours.

441
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,450
My hands are sore
from holding on.

442
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,821
- Well, good night, Jesus.

443
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,290
- What, what?

444
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,391
What is this?

445
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,198
- It's a couch.

446
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:05,733
I know it's no fancy manger,

447
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,302
but it should be better
than an overpass.

448
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,972
- Wait a second.

449
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,373
I hate to do this,
but I'm Jesus.

450
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,743
You know, the son of God.

451
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:20,114
Surely you can offer me
something better than this.

452
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,250
- Hate to do this, right?

453
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,521
Why don't...

455
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:30,024
Why don't you take my bed?

456
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,059
- (laughs) What a guy!

457
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,393
I knew you had it in you.

458
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,461
Are you sure you don't mind?

459
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,395
- Oh.

460
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,864
- Thank you, you're the best!

461
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:37,732
- Yeah.

462
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,870
Dumped by my
girlfriend, got fired,

463
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,205
and I get kicked
out of my own bed

464
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:46,908
by Jesus Christ of all people!

465
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,308
- I can hear you.

466
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,679
- You know I can hear you?

467
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:52,847
- I can still hear you.

468
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,414
- God!

469
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,616
- You know, he doesn't like it

470
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,519
when you use his
name in that context.

471
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:04,491
Hey, Laz, don't forget to pray.

472
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:07,995
It's in private just
how you like it.

473
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,930
- Oh my...

474
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:09,797
Okay!

475
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,334
(upbeat music)

476
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:34,322
(cheerful music)

477
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,115
- No, you get up the ladder.

478
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,550
Yeah, you get on up the ladder.

479
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,118
No, it's your turn.

480
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,553
Get up the ladder.

481
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,459
(indistinct)

482
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:13,728
I got you, man.

483
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:15,596
Well?

484
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:19,100
I got you Henry,
don't worry about it.

485
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,301
It's cool.

486
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,969
Just hang on.

487
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,938
Let's get this hung up.

488
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,744
Lazarus Young.

489
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,913
It's been a month of
Sundays since I've seen you.

490
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:32,947
- Hey there, Pastor Mark.

491
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,082
- Come here, man!

492
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:36,284
- Whoa!

493
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,286
Is that old man Lewis?

494
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,087
- Yeah, Mr. Henry Lewis.

495
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:40,922
- Man, he's still here?

496
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,489
He's been here forever.

497
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:46,093
- Yeah, he's been here since
when my dad ran the church.

498
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:47,295
- Uh, yeah, Pastor Mark,

499
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,030
I'm so sorry to hear
about your loss.

500
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,298
- Well, I appreciate that, Laz.

501
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:53,200
But hey, tell me, what
brings you here today

502
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:54,268
and who's your friend?

503
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,937
He looks kind of familiar.

504
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,339
- Well, I mean, that
actually was why we came,

505
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:01,876
I was wondering if you could
help us out with something?

506
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:04,412
- Are you looking for a job?

507
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,780
- No, no, no, no, no, he's just-

508
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,281
- Actually, yes.

509
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,549
Yes sir.

510
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,985
Pastor Mark, I am
looking for work.

511
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,452
- Let me see,

512
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:16,624
I don't know if we need
anything around here, but...

513
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:17,625
(thuds)

514
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:18,826
- Oh, okay, okay.

515
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,695
- [Mark] Oh my goodness,
Henry, are you okay?

516
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,129
- Oh, I think...

517
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:27,068
I think I can get back up there
and we can finish this up.

518
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,770
- He'll be all right,
he's a tough ol' bird.

519
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:31,238
- You better believe it

520
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:32,573
'cause this ain't nothing

521
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:34,742
to what happened
to me in the war.

522
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,044
- [Laz] Really, you're
a war hero, Henry?

523
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:38,913
- Say, Henry, looks
like you're going to be

524
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:42,550
in the injured
reserve for a while.

525
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,853
Listen, would it be okay
if Laz's friend helps out

526
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:48,189
and fills in for awhile?

527
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:51,158
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
I guess, I guess.

528
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,595
- Thank you, Mr.
Lewis, here you go.

529
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,697
- Thank you, thank you.

530
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,733
- I appreciate, uh,
I really appreciate

531
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,635
you letting me take
over for a little while.

532
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,538
If it helps at all, I have
a good feeling about this,

533
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:08,909
so go home, relax, and
enjoy your time off.

534
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:09,944
- Okay, I...

535
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:13,481
- By the way, what size
are these overalls?

536
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:14,615
- Oh, 32, 32.

537
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,253
- Those are my
measurements exactly.

538
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,755
- I'll let you borrow them.

539
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:21,589
- Perfect!

540
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:24,125
You have a good
rest of your day.

541
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:24,992
- Okay.

542
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,401
- All right, Henry?
- Good.

543
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,738
- Hey, in all the excitement,
I didn't even catch your name.

544
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:38,606
- It's...

545
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,575
Uh.

546
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,711
(clears throat)

547
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:44,678
It's Jesus.

548
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,416
- Jesus, huh?

549
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:49,650
- Yeah.

550
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:50,718
- No wonder you
look so familiar.

551
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,286
(laughs)

552
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,688
Hey, Laz, are you still
good with those computers,

553
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,157
because your mom's
always bragging

554
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,592
about what all the cool
things you can do with them.

555
00:25:58,626 --> 00:25:59,560
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

556
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:00,795
I still do a lot of websites

557
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,696
and social media
marketing mainly.

558
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,165
- Good, good,

559
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:05,833
because we need some of
that right now around here.

560
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:08,069
Would you want to come
on and do some work too?

561
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,203
- Yeah.

562
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,037
- Good!

563
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,572
Then it's settled.

564
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:15,376
You'll do our web stuff and
you'll be our new handyman.

565
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:16,677
- It's perfect.

566
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:21,882
- Hey, Jesus, you got any
experience with carpentry?

567
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:22,883
- I've dabbled.

568
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,285
- (laughs) Of course you have.

569
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,486
You'll both start tomorrow.

570
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,353
- Perfect.

571
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,293
- Sorry to keep
you waiting, Jack.

572
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,661
There was a little...

573
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,062
I was helping Mark in the gym.

574
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,897
So, so how are you doing?

575
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,500
- I'm fine, Serenity,
thanks for asking.

576
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,635
Uh, will Mark be joining us?

577
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,772
- He said he was, but he was
with a couple of guys earlier,

578
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,475
so I'm sure he'll be right
with us in just a bit.

579
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,579
- What do you say
we just get started?

580
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,681
You always seem to exercise
the better judgment

581
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:58,719
when it comes to executing a
cooler business frame of mind.

582
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:02,524
- Okay, then let's
get right to it.

583
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:05,726
- Now as you know, the bank
has been doing all we can

584
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,329
to help you folks
stay on your feet.

585
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:10,030
- Yes, and Mark and I appreciate

586
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:11,732
everything you've done for us.

587
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:12,833
- Yeah, um...

588
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:16,270
- Can I get you something, Jack?

589
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,906
Do you want a coffee or a water?

590
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,474
- No.

591
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:23,377
I better just say
what I came to say.

592
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,712
- You know what,
that sounds serious.

593
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,280
Maybe we should wait for Mark.

594
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,616
Do you want me to go get him?

595
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:28,816
- No, no.

596
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,051
- [Siri] Can I help you
pick up your papers?

597
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:33,622
- No, no, I've got it all.

598
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,990
I assure you that
won't be necessary.

599
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:38,993
As I was saying, we at the
bank have extended the church

600
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,696
a sizable amount of
money, even going past

601
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,367
when Mark's father,
Pastor Wyatt, was here.

602
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,302
God, God rest his soul.

603
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:52,139
- We are nearing the place
where we are comfortably going

604
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,208
to be able to catch
up on what we owe.

605
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,978
- Believe me, I am
so glad to hear that.

606
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,749
But the board has a
difference of opinion.

607
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:05,252
- Jack, you know what
we've been through.

608
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,655
I mean, you used to
go to this church,

609
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,890
you know first-hand what
we've been up against.

610
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:13,662
- Nonetheless, you
and Mark have 45 days

611
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,998
before the bank forecloses
and takes over the property.

612
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:22,203
And the board has other buyers
wanting to buy the property

613
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:25,472
who can pay cash
for it right now.

614
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:26,941
- Is that a fact?

615
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,413
Some of those other interests
wouldn't be WOW Church,

616
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:33,814
would it?

617
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,117
- Now, Mark, you know
I'm not at liberty

618
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:39,420
to divulge that information.

619
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:41,623
- Jack, you and I go way back.

620
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:45,359
- Yes, since the first grade,
I'm fully aware of that.

621
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,094
- And how many times
during that time

622
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:49,396
did I save you from bullies?

623
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,431
- There...

624
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:52,466
There were a few.

625
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,668
- There were many.

626
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:56,003
My God, Jack, you own the bank!

627
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:57,338
Sorry, Lord.

628
00:28:57,371 --> 00:29:00,709
- Yes, but I have
investors and a board.

629
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:07,815
- [Mark] Yeah, and big
depositors like WOW Church.

630
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:09,850
- You guys have 45 days.

631
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,186
That's the best I can do.

632
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,722
I'll see you soon.

633
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,593
- Coming to church on Sunday?

634
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:20,828
- Well, actually, Mark,
we've been attending...

635
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:23,464
- Yeah, let me
guess, WOW Church.

636
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:26,500
And by the way, you
missed a button.

637
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:36,977
- Wow, real mature, Mark.

638
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:38,747
Was all that really necessary?

639
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,182
- Probably not, but I
thought we were friends.

640
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,284
- Uh, we are.

641
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:48,355
But what he's being
forced to do is business.

642
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,791
- How bad is it?

643
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,795
- It's really bad, Mark.

644
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,899
- I probably should've
came back sooner.

645
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:02,102
I mean, truthfully I
should've never left at all.

646
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,773
- You cannot beat
yourself up forever.

647
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,474
Okay, but we do need
to do something.

648
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,843
And the sooner the better.

649
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,012
- We do have that meeting
with that church consultant.

650
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:16,250
Maybe, maybe he's got a miracle
in that briefcase of his.

651
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,719
- Yes.

652
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,354
And at this point, I think
I'm open to anything.

653
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:21,756
- [Mark] Me too.

654
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,391
(upbeat music)

655
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:33,901
- Come on, Jesus.

656
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,711
- Hello.

657
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:44,746
Thank you for coming out today.

658
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:46,347
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

659
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,682
- Aren't you a big one?

660
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:49,316
- Thank you.

661
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,719
- Well, we are in desperate need

662
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:52,754
of making some
changes around here

663
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,855
to help increase
our congregation.

664
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,323
Oh, I'm Serenity Phillips

665
00:30:56,357 --> 00:31:00,060
and this is my husband,
Pastor Mark Phillips.

666
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:03,897
- So listen, this church
has been in our family

667
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,734
for three generations.

668
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:08,969
First with my father,
then my grandfather,

669
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:11,138
who built the church.

670
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:14,709
- If you don't mind,
might I be blunt?

671
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:18,613
- Well, we did ask you here
to help, so by all means.

672
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:20,114
There probably isn't
anything we wouldn't consider

673
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,315
at this point.

674
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,283
- Maybe we start with
a big renovation.

675
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:26,186
I mean, brighter
colors, new fixtures,

676
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,522
maybe even get you a cross.

677
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,256
You know y'all don't
have a cross up there?

678
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,425
You know how many people
come into a church

679
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,427
just for the cross?

680
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,662
And we do that,

681
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:37,264
in one or two months,
and it will be hoppin'!

682
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,533
I guarantee it!

683
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:43,036
- Unfortunately, we
just don't have the time

684
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,305
or the budget for that
project right now.

685
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:48,142
- Not to worry, not to worry.

686
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:52,079
They do not call me "By
God Byron" for nothin'.

687
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:55,817
Excuse my language,
but you're saying is

688
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,017
you need something quick?

689
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,452
- The sooner the better.

690
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,053
- All righty, all righty.

691
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,222
Never fear, Byron is here.

692
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,160
Uh, I got something
that's surefire.

693
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,228
But it's gotta stay in the room.

694
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,097
Y'all gotta make a solemn oath

695
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,133
that we do not tell
anybody about this.

696
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,203
I mean, this is top secret.

697
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:19,874
Now I guarantee that
this will pack them in.

698
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:22,109
People will come from all
over the world to see this

699
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:27,080
and I promise you'll get
media coverage out of it.

700
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,149
- [Mark] Wow, what?

701
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,250
What do you mean?

702
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,719
- Ready for this?

703
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,722
Feast your eyes on this.

704
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:35,590
Ta-da!

705
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:37,926
A Simulacrum.

706
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:40,427
That's right!

707
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,063
I got a guy who can
take a water leak

708
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:47,735
and turn it into the
most beautiful picture
of Jesus Christ.

709
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,470
And for a little
bit of extra money,

710
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,438
lil' bit of extra
money you can get him

711
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:53,708
to continuously cry a tear.

712
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:57,044
Hmm?

713
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,479
(Siri clears throat)

714
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,682
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

715
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,852
You guys are on the up and
up and I appreciate it.

716
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,587
We're going to try
something different, okay?

717
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,590
Now, uh, don't
give up on me yet.

718
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,825
Don't give up on me
now, now you know what?

719
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,059
I just thought of this.

720
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,528
Nobody's ever even
seen this, okay?

721
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:15,295
This the greatest thing ever.

722
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,065
Okay, what we going to do is

723
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:20,501
we're going to try to work up
something bigger and better

724
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:25,105
than I've ever done, but I
guarantee it's going to work.

725
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:26,741
- Okay, we're listening.

726
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:28,676
- Oh, we can't
listen to this, okay?

727
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,711
We got to feel this.

728
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:30,645
Let me have your hands.

729
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:31,846
Let me have your hands, okay?

730
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,080
Y'all grab hands,
y'all love each other,

731
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:35,750
y'all are in love, all right.

732
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,017
All right, now close your eyes.

733
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,319
Every eye closed,
every eye closed?

734
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:42,022
(humming)

735
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,893
Now, see yourself in the chapel.

736
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:47,427
Not an empty seat in the house.

737
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:49,697
Everyone is filled with joy

738
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:53,735
as they hang on to
your every word.

739
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,838
And the choir chimes in,

740
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,273
emphasizing every
one of your words.

741
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,775
Can you feel that?

742
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,746
- I feel something all right.

743
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,481
I feel like somebody
is pulling my leg.

744
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,684
- That is the Holy Spirit!

745
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,387
The best is yet to come.

746
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,590
(humming)

747
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:22,195
The collection plates
start to be passed around.

748
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,933
Money flies through the air.

749
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:29,469
Everyone reaches deep into
their pockets and bags

750
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,439
to give all they can
during the offering.

751
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:36,410
There's laughing and applauding,
applauding and laughing,

752
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,780
all in excited anticipation.

753
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:42,617
- Excited anticipation?

754
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:45,419
Excited about what?

755
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:49,389
Excited about giving money?

756
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,124
In all of my years
in the church,

757
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:53,828
I've never seen any
congregation act as excited

758
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,063
as you're making this sound.

759
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,065
- Please, let him finish?

760
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,801
- You've got to believe, y'all!

761
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,703
Close your eyes back again.

762
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:04,137
(humming)

763
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,139
The collection plates
begin to make their way

764
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,475
to the front of the church

765
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:12,714
through the parishioners'
outstretched hands.

766
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:13,982
Once at the front,

767
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,416
their contents poured
into a larger basket.

768
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,054
I see you, Pastor
Mark, in a gold suit.

769
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:24,191
He approaches the larger basket,
then holds it in the air,

770
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:28,630
slowly turning from side to
side of the congregation.

771
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:33,768
They're all cheering
more than before.

772
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,909
Then another basket
is brought to Mark.

773
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:46,948
It's filled with
names of everyone at
the service that day.

774
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:51,586
He holds it up to the sky
and again everyone cheers.

775
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:55,723
Now Mark says,

776
00:35:55,757 --> 00:35:59,994
"We are so blessed by the
gifts you bring us today.

777
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:03,564
"May God bless you all.

778
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,234
"Can I get an amen?"

779
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:09,804
- [Congregation]
The Lord is great!

780
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,238
- [Byron] Now Mark says,

781
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:15,510
"It's time, it's time to
select today's chosen family!"

782
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,982
Mark reaches into the
basket and shouts,

783
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:24,886
"Victoria and Logan
Owens, come on down!

784
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,254
"You and your family
are the winners

785
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,222
"of this week's
offering sweepstakes

786
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:32,359
"from the First
Church of the Lotto."

787
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,069
(Siri laughs)

788
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:44,605
- So, so we give the family
all of the offerings?

789
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,306
- No, they get half.

790
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,810
Half.

791
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:51,344
I mean, minus my fees
and handling of course.

792
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,714
- Ah, of course.

793
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:55,315
- But it's gotta
make some money.

794
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:56,984
And they're all going
to file in each week

795
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,886
for the big family pay off.

796
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,754
Each week!

797
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:03,124
- The First Church of the Lotto?

798
00:37:03,157 --> 00:37:04,391
(laughs)

799
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:05,860
- You can kind of think of it

800
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,896
as like a high stakes
bingo night every Sunday.

801
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,997
Every Sunday!

802
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,901
It's 100% legal.

803
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:17,538
I mean, I know at least
60% of it is legal

804
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,473
and I'll work out the 40%

805
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,943
before we implement
it here at the church.

806
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:23,410
- Uh, okay.

807
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,747
I tell you, Mister
"By God Byron",

808
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,016
we'll discuss it and
get back in touch, okay?

809
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,719
- The First Church of the Lotto!

810
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:36,389
- See, I knew your
preacher would like it.

811
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:40,260
You are hard to sell,
but I knew he'd like it.

812
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:41,729
Well, okay, okay.

813
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:46,768
Hey, I don't have a card per se,

814
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:49,070
but let me leave you this, okay?

815
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:51,572
That way next time
you think of Jesus,

816
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:54,709
you think of "By God Byron."

817
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:56,376
- All right, we'll call ya.

818
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,213
- Hey, so what's
it going to take

819
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,848
to actually get ya
signed up for this thing?

820
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:04,384
I don't ever do this, but I'll
give it to you for half off,

821
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:07,789
or how about 33 1/3% off?

822
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,865
- Well, you were no help!

823
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:19,299
- The First Church of the Lotto.

824
00:38:19,332 --> 00:38:21,669
(laughs)

825
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,137
- I guess we're
back at square one.

826
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:24,939
- No, I don't know.

827
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,775
I asked Laz and his
friend to help out.

828
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:30,178
Laz can do his thing
with the computer

829
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:32,146
and get us some presence
on the internet.

830
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,748
- And what's his friend's name?

831
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:34,615
- Jesus.

832
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,918
- I think you've
been hanging out

833
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:38,719
with "By God Byron" too long.

834
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:40,855
What, seriously?

835
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,355
- You know, that's what
he said his name was

836
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,793
and I figured with Henry
down it can't do any harm.

837
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:46,661
- Jesus?

838
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:50,330
- Yeah, he kind of
looks like him too.

839
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:51,364
- Like who?

840
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:52,834
- Jesus!

841
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:57,138
- (laughs) Oh, oh, we
have our own Jesus now.

842
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,606
Yeah, that's
definitely not going

843
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,041
to cause any chaos around here.

844
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:02,143
I mean, oh and thank God,

845
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,312
we made a little bit of money

846
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,981
off of "By God Byron" after all.

847
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:15,323
- Wow, Wi-Fi on
Earth is so slow.

848
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:18,593
How am I supposed
to check my crypto?

849
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:20,328
- Wait, you guys
have Wi-Fi in heaven?

850
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,596
- Yeah.

851
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:22,429
- [Laz] Wait, you guys
have crypto in heaven?

852
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:23,496
- Uh huh.

853
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:25,066
Unregulated too.

854
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,000
- Huh.

855
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,702
So, this Wi-Fi in heaven?

856
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,770
- Yeah, it's super-fast.

857
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:31,272
- Okay.

858
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,241
Okay, I'll bite, how fast
is the Wi-Fi in heaven?

859
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:36,310
- Have you heard of
how fast angels fly?

860
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:38,713
- Yeah, it's referenced
several times in the Bible.

861
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:40,447
It's faster than
the speed of light.

862
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,251
- Yeah, it's like that
except like times a thousand.

863
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:47,521
You just turn it on and it
goes 'cause, anjello blast.

864
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,891
- (laughs) Anjello?

865
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:52,026
- Anjello blast!

866
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,629
That's the verb for
how fast angels go,

867
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,664
it's what we call
our Wi-Fi up there.

868
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:57,999
- So up and download?

869
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,200
- Easy, buddy.

870
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:03,371
In heaven we don't like
to say the word download.

871
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,404
Never!

872
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:06,073
- Right.

873
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,575
All right, well,
I've got to get busy.

874
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:11,478
So, you got to take notes,
make a list, something.

875
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,582
- Notes, a list?

876
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:15,650
A list of what?

877
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:17,151
- Anything?

878
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:19,787
I don't know, something to
help you find your purpose.

879
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,256
- So what are you working on?

880
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:24,792
- A thing.

881
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:26,093
- A thing?

882
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:26,961
Really?

883
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,763
What kind of a thing?

884
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,032
- It's just a thing.

885
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:31,899
- A thing.

886
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:34,434
- Yes.
- A thingy.

887
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,339
Oh, is it a thing to meet girls?

888
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:41,676
- No.

889
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,078
- Okay, it's not a girl thing?

890
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,414
Is it a thing to order food?

891
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,717
- You're not gonna
rest, are you?

892
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,551
- Uh-uh.

893
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:54,922
- Basically, it's
a social media site

894
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:58,092
that I made for people
of faith to get on,

895
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,895
you know, share their
hopes, their prayers,

896
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,564
and their experiences online.

897
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:04,799
- Now that's a thing!

898
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:05,666
I love it!

899
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:09,003
- Yeah, well, Chloe
wasn't too hot about it.

900
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:09,937
- What?

901
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,439
- Nothing.

902
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:15,676
So my hope is that, you know,
people of faith can get on,

903
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,612
share their experiences with
one another in the world.

904
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:20,414
- That is perfect.

905
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:23,584
- Yeah, well, I've developed
several algorithms for it

906
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:26,887
so it won't allow any
negative comments,

907
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:28,956
inappropriate content,
or false information.

908
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,058
It's just a page
for people to gather

909
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:33,160
to cherish and love the Lord.

910
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:36,530
- Just how does it help bring
more people to the church?

911
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:38,065
- For sure, for sure.

912
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,401
So the goal is for the church
to be able to upload content,

913
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:43,304
sermons, or different
like images and videos,

914
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,573
that way other people
can kind of check it out.

915
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:47,575
- Just like other
social media sites?

916
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:50,911
- Exactly, that way when
other Christians get on

917
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:53,014
and see the videos
or testimonials

918
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:54,482
and get to know the
church a little bit better

919
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,250
before coming here.

920
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:58,819
I call it FaithBookFriends.com.

921
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,123
- I say we do it.

922
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:05,626
It's either that or First
Church of the Lotto.

923
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,698
- I'm sorry, First
Church of the what now?

924
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:11,565
- Oh, no.

925
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:14,201
How about you two
keep going on this

926
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:18,739
and I will take Jesus,
yeah, to the supply closet

927
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:21,342
and I'll get you
started on your day.

928
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,943
- Didn't you wear
that shirt yesterday?

929
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:23,978
- What?

930
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:24,812
- Yeah?

931
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,847
- Is that illegal here?

932
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:29,483
I wore the same
tunic for 33 years.

933
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:32,787
I'll wear the same
shirt twice in a day.

934
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,021
- He thinks he's...

935
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,790
Anyway, so this
is the home page.

936
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,158
- So right in here
is the supply closet.

937
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:38,859
This is where you'll...

938
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:40,261
Yep.

939
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:42,430
Where you'll find
everything you'll need.

940
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:43,631
- [Jesus] Hey!

941
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,968
- Just so you know, this
door is a little tricky.

942
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,170
Anytime you come in here,

943
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:51,205
you're going to want
to put something

944
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,107
to keep it from
swinging shut on itself

945
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,242
'cause it will lock and
once you're in here,

946
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:57,411
there's no way out but up.

947
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,314
- I get that a lot.

948
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:01,882
- Oh, right, Jesus.

949
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:05,653
Right, got it.

950
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:07,688
Do you go by Jesus mostly?

951
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:09,723
- No, it's a hard Jesus.

952
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:14,395
You and Pastor Mark
been here long?

953
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:20,267
- You might say
most of our lives.

954
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,470
His dad took it from
his grandfather,

955
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:26,575
so it's been in our family
for a long, long time.

956
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:31,779
- Do you mind me
asking what happened?

957
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:35,216
The church, it seems
a little in decline

958
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,587
and Pastor Mark, he
seems a little lost.

959
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:44,391
- Yeah, some days
more than others.

960
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:49,430
All along, Mark was supposed
to take over this place.

961
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,965
And just like his
dad before that,

962
00:43:50,998 --> 00:43:53,734
he was really tough on him
to hold up to that dream.

963
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,202
- That's like my dad-

964
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:58,507
- Mark's dad was a real
fire and brimstone type

965
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,141
of minister.

966
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:02,676
- Man, those were the days.

967
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,148
- Boy, that man could scare
any room into righteousness.

968
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:08,415
- Let me guess, Mark didn't want

969
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:10,918
to be that kind of
spiritual leader?

970
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,052
- Not at all.

971
00:44:13,454 --> 00:44:16,223
But when his daddy prepared
him for his first sermon

972
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:18,726
in front of the entire church,

973
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:24,465
he demanded that he do it
exactly like daddy taught him.

974
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,302
- God doesn't care
if you are happy.

975
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:30,971
No, he does not.

976
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:33,374
He only cares that you follow

977
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,578
in the course he has
laid out for you.

978
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,354
- God does not care
if you are happy.

979
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,293
He only cares that you follow
the path he has chosen...

980
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:53,460
No, no, he does not.

981
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:54,295
He only...

982
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:56,764
- God, spit it out, boy!

983
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:57,599
- God...

984
00:44:57,632 --> 00:45:01,068
(clears throat)

985
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:03,137
Dad, I can't say this.

986
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,540
I don't believe a word of it.

987
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,209
- It doesn't matter
what you believe.

988
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,744
It matters what they believe.

989
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:13,781
If you're gonna lead
these followers,

990
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:16,150
they need to know uneasiness

991
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:21,556
and that you and you alone
are ready to lead them

992
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,123
through the spiritual storms

993
00:45:23,157 --> 00:45:26,827
that life is going
to throw at them.

994
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,095
Come on.

995
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:30,565
(slow music)

996
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:35,736
- God...

997
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:40,609
- Now this is a very
special day for me.

998
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:44,111
You know, it hadn't
been that long ago

999
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:48,816
that my father before me
stood at this very pulpit

1000
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:52,687
and allowed me to lead
you to the word of God.

1001
00:45:56,991 --> 00:46:00,662
And today, I am ready
to introduce to you...

1002
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:07,101
Um.

1003
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:15,442
I am ready to tell
you that very soon

1004
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:26,521
that I will very soon be ready
to do the same for my son.

1005
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:38,165
But until then, I'm afraid
you're just stuck with me.

1006
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:41,368
(congregation laughs)

1007
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:48,175
- After that day, Mark
went back to school,

1008
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:52,313
then started to preach
the way his heart led him,

1009
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:55,650
until his dad passed away.

1010
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:58,620
- Did they ever
talk about that day?

1011
00:46:58,653 --> 00:47:01,656
- They barely spoke after that.

1012
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,460
After college, Mark and
I went on a mission trip,

1013
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:09,163
then he started traveling with
the Power Team Ministry's,

1014
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:13,200
and shortly after that,
his Dad got really sick.

1015
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:18,573
- Did they have a
chance to reconcile?

1016
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,008
- No.

1017
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:25,747
Mark tried, but it didn't
happen before his dad died.

1018
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,818
That's always been really
heavy on Mark's heart.

1019
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,056
And then after that,

1020
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:41,395
Mark started questioning his
own spiritual leadership and...

1021
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:45,099
Why am I even telling
you all of this?

1022
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:48,603
(laughs) Jesus, you're
easy to talk to.

1023
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:50,037
I mean, I mean...

1024
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:53,374
- Hey, you're totally fine.

1025
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:55,242
I get it all the time.

1026
00:47:56,944 --> 00:48:00,849
I just, I wish there was
something I could do to help.

1027
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,816
- There is.

1028
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,654
We keep the brooms and mops and
cleaning supplies over here,

1029
00:48:06,688 --> 00:48:08,623
office supplies
are on that side,

1030
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:13,528
and yeah, all the work we do
around here is God's work.

1031
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:15,028
- Nice.

1032
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:17,231
Uh, where should I start?

1033
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:20,334
- Why don't you sweep and
clean the classroom area?

1034
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,203
We have teen studies
this evening.

1035
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:26,741
You know, I'm going to
go check on Mark and Laz.

1036
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:27,709
- Yes, ma'am.

1037
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:28,576
Will do.

1038
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,919
- So you really think this
can connect with enough people

1039
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:40,655
to help rebuild the church?

1040
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:42,489
- Well, yeah.

1041
00:48:42,524 --> 00:48:44,759
There's still a lot of work
that needs to be done though.

1042
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:46,126
Set-up, content,

1043
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:50,565
plus direct people on how
to find and use the site.

1044
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:52,266
- How can we help?

1045
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:55,369
- Well, first a little funding.

1046
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:56,336
- A little.

1047
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,772
I think we can handle a little.

1048
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:58,972
- And content.

1049
00:48:59,006 --> 00:49:01,208
We'll need continuous
streams of content

1050
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,076
to kind of fuel the page
when it first gets started.

1051
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,346
So, calendar
information updates,

1052
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,383
words of wisdom,
and testimonials.

1053
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:10,552
- Testimonials?

1054
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:13,153
- Yeah, just some videos
of little snippets

1055
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:15,255
of people talking about
why they like the church

1056
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,858
and when they
started coming here.

1057
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:19,594
That way people with FOMO
will see it and you know...

1058
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:20,862
- [Siri] What?

1059
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,429
That sounds like a bad
hangover or something.

1060
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:24,198
- No, no, no, no,
no, it's not bad.

1061
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:26,300
It just means fear
of missing out.

1062
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,101
So that way when they
see the testimonials,

1063
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,371
they'll have the urge to be a
part of everything next time.

1064
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:34,709
- So, in our case you're talking
about like the next Sunday,

1065
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:36,310
or the next Bible study.

1066
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,545
- Exactly, yeah.

1067
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,548
So, I won't be able to
shoot the videos myself,

1068
00:49:40,582 --> 00:49:42,149
just because getting this
up and running is going

1069
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:43,885
to take all the time I have.

1070
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:48,055
- Not to worry, I know just
the perfect two to ask.

1071
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,356
Jade and Caleb!

1072
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,292
- From our teen youth group?

1073
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:53,494
- Right.

1074
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:54,896
That might be just
what they need

1075
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,463
to make them feel important
part of the church.

1076
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:57,932
- You're a brave
man, Pastor Mark.

1077
00:49:57,966 --> 00:50:00,602
You have no idea what you're
setting yourself up for.

1078
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:03,103
- We'll find out this afternoon.

1079
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:05,773
- Speak of the devils, and I
mean that in the nicest way,

1080
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:07,441
but we better go get
prepared for them.

1081
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:10,477
They took us off guard
too many times last week.

1082
00:50:10,512 --> 00:50:12,079
- That was pretty
funny, you gotta admit,

1083
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,748
when they got you with
that whoopee cushion.

1084
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:17,719
- It might've been funny, if
it wasn't filled with water.

1085
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:19,954
(laughs)

1086
00:50:19,988 --> 00:50:21,355
Are you coming?

1087
00:50:21,388 --> 00:50:22,991
- Yeah, I'm coming.

1088
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:27,160
(teens chattering)

1089
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:39,774
I'm okay with that, for sure.

1090
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:41,174
(whistles)

1091
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,844
All right, all right.

1092
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:45,212
(clapping)

1093
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:47,114
- One, two, three, eyes on me.

1094
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:49,182
- [Class] One, two, eyes on you.

1095
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,118
- Thank you, thank you.

1096
00:50:52,854 --> 00:50:54,421
- Impressive, yeah.

1097
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:59,426
Okay, okay, so who all did
your assignment for last week

1098
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:02,462
and read it in the
Bible this week?

1099
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:06,935
- I did.

1100
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:09,069
- Jade, great.

1101
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:11,405
That's wonderful.

1102
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:13,942
So, what passage did you find?

1103
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:19,379
- Is it all right if I
share it with the class?

1104
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:24,052
- I think that would be perfect.

1105
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,559
(clears throat)

1106
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:35,362
- "Let him kiss me with
the kisses of his mouth:

1107
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:37,765
for thy love is
better than wine.

1108
00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:40,001
(class laughs)

1109
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:43,236
Because of the savior
of thy good ointments,

1110
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,974
thy name is as
ointment poured forth,

1111
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:48,576
therefore do the
virgins love thee."

1112
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,377
(laughs)

1113
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,879
- [Class] Ooh!

1114
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:54,782
- "Draw me, we will
run after thee:

1115
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:59,587
the king hath brought
me into his chambers:

1116
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:02,155
we will be glad and
rejoice in thee,

1117
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:05,325
we will remember your
love more than wine:

1118
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,762
the upright rejoice in thee."

1119
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,065
- Okay, okay, that's good.

1120
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:14,002
Song of Solomon,

1121
00:52:14,035 --> 00:52:16,336
one of the most beautiful
books of the Bible,

1122
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:19,272
but it can be a
little descriptive.

1123
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:21,208
- But only for committed

1124
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:25,647
and eventually married
couples' love for each other.

1125
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,348
- What exactly does it
mean in chapter four

1126
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:30,985
where the groom talks
about the garden,

1127
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:33,253
honey, wine, and milk?

1128
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:34,822
- Honey, wine, and milk?

1129
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:36,991
Is this about marriage
or buying groceries?

1130
00:52:37,025 --> 00:52:39,127
(class laughs)

1131
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:40,828
- That part there...

1132
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:46,834
That part there is kind of
about the honeymoon part

1133
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:48,036
of the wedding.

1134
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:52,140
- When did you guys
make it to chapter four?

1135
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:54,609
- Well, jeez, I mean,

1136
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:57,310
we read the Bible
together all the time,

1137
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,479
but I don't know

1138
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:02,917
that we've ever read
Song of Solomon together.

1139
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:05,318
- I don't think that's
what she's asking, Mark.

1140
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,022
As I mentioned, Pastor
and I have been together

1141
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:11,826
since seventh grade and we've
been together ever since.

1142
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,293
- Except that time in college

1143
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:16,631
when you said you needed a
break because you met Sergio.

1144
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,866
(class laughs)

1145
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,703
- And we've been happily
married for 20 years.

1146
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:23,905
(bell rings)

1147
00:53:23,938 --> 00:53:26,541
- We have got to
hire a youth pastor.

1148
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:27,775
- Yes.

1149
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:31,179
- Caleb, Jade, hang out
for a second, please.

1150
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:37,719
- Hey, you were the
ones who told us

1151
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:40,021
to read from the Bible
and share it in class.

1152
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,354
- Oh, no, this isn't about that.

1153
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,791
We have a little favor to ask.

1154
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:46,426
- Right, so you
guys know anything

1155
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,696
about social media content?

1156
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,601
Okay, cool!

1157
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:57,404
So, what we'd like you to do
is shoot a few small videos

1158
00:53:57,437 --> 00:54:00,508
on Sunday morning
before and after church.

1159
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,242
You can ask the folks
that come, you know,

1160
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:04,444
kind of what they enjoy.

1161
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:05,813
Maybe some experiences
they've had here

1162
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,515
at Friends of Faith.

1163
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:10,151
- Does it have to
be all churchy?

1164
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:11,753
- No, no, no, no, not at all.

1165
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:13,821
We just want something simple.

1166
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:16,289
- Yeah, sure, we can do that.

1167
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,358
- Cool!

1168
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,795
This is going to be fantastic!

1169
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:24,031
Actually, you know what else,
I think it's a good idea

1170
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:28,903
for you to do something
recording every
Sunday at service!

1171
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,515
(high fives)

1172
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:47,354
- So, any idea coming up
with why you're here yet?

1173
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,689
- No, not yet.

1174
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:50,423
- Yeah, me neither.

1175
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:51,926
You know what we need?

1176
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,293
We need a distraction.

1177
00:54:53,326 --> 00:54:54,695
- What do you mean?

1178
00:54:54,729 --> 00:54:56,230
What kind of distraction?

1179
00:54:56,264 --> 00:54:57,999
- I don't know, something
to take our mind off of it.

1180
00:54:58,032 --> 00:54:59,901
- I like it, all right.

1181
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:02,103
What did you have in mind?

1182
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:04,772
- Have you ever played tennis?

1183
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,774
- Have I ever played tennis?

1184
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:09,309
I've played with the greats!

1185
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:10,410
Let's do it!

1186
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:13,014
(upbeat music)

1187
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:48,015
What is this?

1188
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:50,084
- I did theater in high school,
it's called a quick change.

1189
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:52,286
You get really good at it.

1190
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:01,929
(triumphant music)

1191
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:07,335
All right.

1192
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,272
- I thought we were
playing tennis.

1193
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:13,241
- Well, it's tennis-like.

1194
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:14,742
It's pickle ball.

1195
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:18,512
A fun, fast, friendly game
the whole family can enjoy.

1196
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:20,147
- All right, I think I'm ready.

1197
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:21,682
- Oh, you better be.

1198
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:23,851
I don't take any prisoners
on the pickle ball court.

1199
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:25,953
- All right, let's see what
you've got, David of Bethlehem!

1200
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:27,154
Let's do it!

1201
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:28,823
- All right, Jesus
of Nazareth, come on!

1202
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:30,423
♪ Jesus is a friend of mine ♪

1203
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,859

1209
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:42,270
- Na, na, na, na, na.

1210
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:45,306
My name is Laz and I'm
great at pickle ball.

1211
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:48,342
Your name is Jesus and
you're not good at all.

1212
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:49,677
- Really?

1213
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,878
That's the kind of
sportsmanship you want to show

1214
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:52,146
while you're playing
the chosen one?

1215
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,848
(thunder crashes)

1216
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:55,716
- I'll, I'll watch it.

1217
00:56:57,518 --> 00:56:58,319
- Yeah.

1218
00:56:58,352 --> 00:56:59,954
Yeah, you might as well.

1219
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:00,922
It's your serve.

00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:02,156

That's game!

1229
00:57:26,314 --> 00:57:28,349
- Pretty good at this
pickle ball thing.

1230
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:33,354
- Hey, thanks, I originally got
good at it to impress Chloe.

1231
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:34,588
- Chloe?

1232
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:36,958
Is that the underwear
in the streets girl?

1233
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:41,395
- Yes, thank you so much
for reminding me about that.

1234
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:43,998
She actually introduced
me to the game.

1235
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:44,999
- Really?

1236
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:46,834
- Mm-hm, she was
really good too.

1237
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:48,336
- [Jesus] Wow.

1238
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:52,440
- Yeah, beat the poop out
of me every time we played.

1239
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:54,709
She was the love of my life.

1240
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:55,576
- Okay.

1241
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,079
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1242
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,916
That's no way for a pickle
ball champion to act.

1243
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,617
After you just beat Jesus?

1244
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:05,353
Come on, man!

1245
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:06,287
Buck up!

1246
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,655
- I suppose not.

1247
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:10,925
She was just really
special, that Chloe.

1248
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,360
- I feel like you're forgetting

1249
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:14,494
that this is the girl
that threw your underwear

1250
00:58:14,528 --> 00:58:15,763
into a very public street.

1251
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:18,366
- Yes, yes, in front of
everyone and you and God

1252
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:19,700
that all witnessed the horror.

1253
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:21,202
I get it.

1254
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:22,436
- So, what makes you think you
were in love with this girl?

1255
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,205
- Okay, still, still
in love with her.

1256
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:25,806
- All right, I get it.

1257
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,011
Why don't you tell me one
happy story about Chloe?

1258
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:33,948
- Okay, um, yeah,
okay, her birthday!

1259
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:35,182
Her birthday earlier this month,

1260
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:36,951
I surprised her with
a trip to San Antonio.

1261
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:38,452
- Wow, you really went all out?

1262
00:58:38,486 --> 00:58:43,457
- Yeah, that was (clears
throat) the trip she said

1263
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:50,898
she thought we might have
really something special.

1264
00:58:56,404 --> 00:58:57,638
- Wow!

1265
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:58,572
Well, did you go ahead
and book the minister

1266
00:58:58,606 --> 00:59:00,708
right then and there, huh?

1267
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:01,842
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1268
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:04,045
Um, how about this?

1269
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:06,714
What did she do
for your birthday?

1270
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:07,681
- My birthday?

1271
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,550
- Yeah, two weeks ago?

1272
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:13,087
- How did you know that?

1273
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,922
- I'm Jesus?

1274
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:16,624
Also, uh, you had a
birthday card on your desk

1275
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:18,659
back at the apartment.

1276
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,161
Kind of gave it away.

1277
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:23,464
- Oh, uh, my
birthday, my birthday.

1278
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:25,466
Uh, well, she was actually
busy on my birthday.

1279
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:26,801
She had plans with
her best friend,

1280
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:28,537
so they had like a
girl's night out.

1281
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,670
But she did text me!

1282
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:31,872
And three days
later, we celebrated.

1283
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:33,040
- Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

1284
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:34,509
What did you guys end up doing?

1285
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:36,444
- Oh, no, no, no, she
brought me a cupcake

1286
00:59:36,477 --> 00:59:38,379
with a little
birthday candle on it.

1287
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:41,248
- Good, so did you enjoy that?

1288
00:59:41,282 --> 00:59:43,117
- Well, no, I have
a gluten allergy,

1289
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:47,488
so I actually had a good
time watching her enjoy it.

1290
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:51,192
- Is this the first
time she ever heard

1291
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:53,494
of your gluten intolerance?

1292
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:59,467
- Well, no, I only mentioned
it like every time we ate.

1293
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,935
- Ugh.

1294
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:02,470
So, we're right back to the
underwear in the street.

1295
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:04,004
- Stop, it's not like that.

1296
01:00:04,038 --> 01:00:07,875
- Listen, Laz, you're not
in love with Chloe, okay?

1297
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:11,045
You're in love with the
idea of being in love, okay?

1298
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:13,080
Like this idea of
not being alone

1299
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,783
and just having someone
around to impress.

1300
01:00:15,816 --> 01:00:17,718
- What do you mean?

1301
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:21,021
- Her birthday, big
production, all the shebangs,

1302
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:24,859
yay, we're doing
this and that, woo!

1303
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:27,361
And then your birthday.
- Okay.

1304
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,798
- Fourth of July, no fireworks.

1305
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:32,500
Being in love isn't
supposed to be hard.

1306
01:00:32,534 --> 01:00:34,668
That's supposed to be the
easy part of the relationship.

1307
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:36,704
You meet someone, your
heart starts to flutter, ah.

1308
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:38,372
It's easy, effortless.

1309
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,374
It's everything else
that takes time.

1310
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:42,710
You know, every special moment
you get to spend together,

1311
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:45,446
you're building a foundation
of little miracles.

1312
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,047
- Okay, well, that
sounds all good and all,

1313
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:50,050
but it's never worked
that way for me.

1314
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:52,086
- That's only because you
haven't found the person

1315
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:54,088
you're meant to be with.

1316
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,958
But I have an idea.

1317
01:00:57,992 --> 01:00:59,827
- I can't wait to hear
the answer to this.

1318
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,530
What's your idea?

1319
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:04,798
- You, me, tonight,
we go out, we party,

1320
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,736
and Jesus is your wing man.

1321
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,838
- I can already hear that going
over great with the ladies.

1322
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:12,072
How we doing?

1323
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:16,277
My name is Laz and this
is my wing man, Jesus.

1324
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,745
- That's the best opening
line I've ever heard.

1325
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:19,713
- Whatever, all right.
- Let's do it!

1326
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:22,349

1327
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:35,896

to eat that, are you?

1339
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,342
- [Laz] Have at it, man.

1340
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,711
- Mm!

1341
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:25,746
What do you say we
do another round?

1342
01:02:30,951 --> 01:02:32,587
- Uh, I don't know, man,

1343
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:34,221
two chocolate shakes
in 10 minutes,

1344
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,289
might be pushing your limit.

1345
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:37,726
Let's slow down a little bit.

1346
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:40,327
- Oh, hey, hey, hey!

1347
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:43,030
Don't look now, but there's
a beautiful young woman

1348
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:47,034
at your three o'clock and
she's totally looking at you.

1349
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:49,169
(laughs)

1350
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,208
Yep, she totally smiled at you.

1351
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:59,046
You should go over to her.

1352
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,382
- (laughs) And do what?

1353
01:03:01,415 --> 01:03:03,217
- You'd better do it
quick, whatever it is.

1354
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,485
She looks like a millennial.

1355
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:05,853
You're going to lose her
interest to the internet

1356
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:08,723
in like five more seconds.

1357
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:10,625
- No, no, no, I think...

1358
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:12,059
I think just coming out
tonight was a big step.

1359
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,961
Maybe next time.

1360
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:15,462
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1361
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:16,864
Have you ever
heard of the phrase

1362
01:03:16,897 --> 01:03:18,566
that time is of the essence?

1363
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,636
Well, now is the time and
you're full of all the essence!

1364
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,337
Go talk to her, man.

1365
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:29,476
- (laughs) I wouldn't know
the first thing to say to her.

1366
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:30,878
- I got it.

1367
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:32,747
All right, you get
up, you walk over.

1368
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:35,550
Nay, you don't walk, you strut.

1369
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:38,586
Strut over to her like
a Portuguese Prince

1370
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,120
and you look her
right in the eye

1371
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:45,159
and you go "Behold now, thou
art a fair woman to look upon."

1372
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:52,066
- What?

1373
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:53,067
- It works every time.

1374
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,501
- In century one, yeah!

1375
01:03:54,536 --> 01:03:56,070
- All right, well,
add your own lines.

1376
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:57,304
Be creative.

1377
01:03:57,338 --> 01:04:00,074
Oh, but before you go,
you got a little...

1378
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:00,908
You got a little
something right there.

1379
01:04:00,941 --> 01:04:01,909
- Oh yeah?

1380
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:02,843
That could've been bad.

1381
01:04:02,876 --> 01:04:04,445
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1382
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:05,245
On the side, right?

1383
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:06,947
Did I get it?

1384
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:07,881
- Yep.
- Yeah?

1385
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:08,849
- Yeah, you're good to go.

1386
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:10,652
- Okay.
- Ship shape!

1387
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:11,519
- I'm going to do it!

1388
01:04:11,553 --> 01:04:12,687
- That's the spirit.

1389
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,054
Go get her, buddy!
- Okay, I'm gonna do it.

1390
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:15,022
Okay, okay.

1391
01:04:15,956 --> 01:04:17,324
Just go up.

1392
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,794
Behold, thou art a beautiful
woman to look upon.

1393
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:23,163
Thou art a beautiful
woman to look upon.

1394
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:27,101
- Reciting scripture?

1395
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:30,904
Does Genesis usually work
as a pickup line for you?

1396
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:33,608
(Laz laughs)

1397
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:35,376
No, I'm just kidding.

1398
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:38,011
Funny though,

1399
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:42,416
I'm not sure Abram had quite
as thick of a mustache.

1400
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:46,186
- (laughs) I'm so sorry,
I'm not usually so...

1401
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,889
- Let me guess, so entertaining?

1402
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,527
I'm sorry, I should
stop laughing.

1403
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,661
I'm Dee Dee.

1404
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:56,731
- I'm Laz, and I
promise I usually shave

1405
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,434
before I meet someone new.

1406
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:01,935
(laughs)

1407
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:04,171
- Oh, it seems like
your friend is getting

1408
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:06,841
a pretty good chuckle out of it.

1409
01:05:08,942 --> 01:05:10,978
- I think he's had a
couple too many shakes.

1410
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,112
- That'll do it.

1411
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:13,815
(laughs)

1412
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:15,315
- Would you like to meet him?

1413
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:17,084
I'm sure he'd like
you to join us.

1414
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:19,019
- Any other time I would,

1415
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:22,690
but I would love to
get to know someone

1416
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:25,426
who uses the Bible
to pick up women,

1417
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:29,096
but to be honest, I was
just about to leave.

1418
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:33,066
- I'm sorry, did I
do something wrong?

1419
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,669
- No, not at all.

1420
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:37,906
I'm just in town
for a job interview.

1421
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:40,542
- Well, if it was up
to me, you'd get it.

1422
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:42,009
- Oh, there you go.

1423
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:44,077
Now you're getting the hang
of this flirting thing.

1424
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,345
(laughs)

1425
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:48,482
- No, no, no, no,
like what I meant-

1426
01:05:48,516 --> 01:05:50,417
- I'm just pulling your leg.

1427
01:05:50,451 --> 01:05:51,920
Look, I'll tell you what,

1428
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:55,255
if tomorrow goes well
and I get the job,

1429
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:59,393
maybe I'll meet you back
here again sometime.

1430
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:02,262
- Well, I'll be praying
that you do then.

1431
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,031
- Laz, I believe
you are beginning

1432
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:05,600
to really hit your groove.

1433
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,702
(laughs)

1434
01:06:10,905 --> 01:06:11,739
- Okay.

1435
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:15,543
Bye, bye, bye, Dee Dee!

1436
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:19,012
Okay.

1437
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:27,555
- Well?

1438
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,492
Don't leave me in suspense, man!

1439
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:32,961
What did she say?

1440
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:37,699
- She said she's just in
town for a job interview.

1441
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:39,834
- Okay, what did you say?

1442
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:44,137
- I told her I'd
be praying for her.

1443
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,607
Come on, let's go.

1444
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,575
I've got some ideas for
the site I want to work on.

1445
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:49,209
- All right.

1446
01:06:49,243 --> 01:06:53,781
♪ Baby, baby, oh ♪

1447
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:58,820
♪ Wanna go to the movies ♪

1448
01:06:59,988 --> 01:07:04,024
♪ Maybe take a walk
under the moonbeams ♪

1449
01:07:04,993 --> 01:07:08,763
♪ You wanna go to the movies ♪

1450
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:13,400
- I tell you, Dee Dee, you
have a very impressive resume

1451
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:15,737
and come highly recommended.

1452
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:18,506
- That is so nice to hear.

1453
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,440
Thank you for sharing that.

1454
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:24,946
- It takes a very special person
to handle those young souls

1455
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:26,648
and keep your composure

1456
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:30,484
in the middle of these difficult
challenging interactions.

1457
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:34,121
- I find that part to
be the most fun part.

1458
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:38,158
Teenagers can really
trip a person up.

1459
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:39,459
- Tell me about it.

1460
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:41,295
That's the problem the
current teachers have.

1461
01:07:41,328 --> 01:07:44,398
- If you don't mind me asking,

1462
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:48,335
what is the current
instructor situation

1463
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,038
regarding the teens?

1464
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:00,949
- My wife and I.

1465
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:04,151
- Oh my, I am so
sorry, I had no idea.

1466
01:08:07,454 --> 01:08:10,424
But from the way
your email read,

1467
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:14,662
it was as if the people
handling the class right now

1468
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:17,865
have no idea what they're doing.

1469
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,199
- That's exactly how we feel.

1470
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:21,636
Just absolutely helpless.

1471
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:26,040
- Oh, I'm sure you guys
are doing just fine.

1472
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,475
- No, no, not at all.

1473
01:08:28,509 --> 01:08:30,444
As a matter of fact, I hope
you can start right away.

1474
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:35,182
Because if I have to go back
in that class one more time,

1475
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:37,552
I'm just gonna
break down and cry.

1476
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:40,054
And that's not a good
look for me at all.

1477
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:42,422
- There, there, Pastor Mark.

1478
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:46,193
As it turns out, I
can start right away.

1479
01:08:46,226 --> 01:08:47,829
I have an aunt who lives in town

1480
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:50,932
and I can stay with her
until I get all settled.

1481
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:55,135
- Oh, you have no idea how
happy you just made me.

1482
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,373
Oh, I guess we should go give
you a tour of your new home.

1483
01:08:59,406 --> 01:09:01,576
- I'd very much like that.

1484
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:06,047
- And so I switched
to decaf, so...

1485
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,451
Hello.

1486
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:14,187
Looks like you're getting
that second chance after all.

1487
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:15,222
Take a look.

1488
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:18,191
(Laz laughs)

1489
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:19,560
- What, Dee Dee?

1490
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:23,430
Yes, and by the
looks of that smile,

1491
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:25,133
I think Pastor Mark
just gave her the job

1492
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:27,167
of the new youth pastor.

1493
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:32,874
- But I thought you and
Pastor Mark had a handle

1494
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,042
on that teen group.

1495
01:09:34,075 --> 01:09:35,843
- (laughs) Oh, no.

1496
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:37,145
No, not at all.

1497
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,450
(snaps)

1498
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,586
- Was Jesus magic?

1499
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,387
- Yeah, was he magic,

1500
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:50,591
like those guys we
see on the internet?

1501
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:53,226
(class laughs)

1502
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,167
- So those kings just left Jesus

1503
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,169
with like a bunch
of birthday cash?

1504
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,270
(gasps)

1505
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:06,373
- Did Joseph have
a gambling problem?

1506
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:07,407
Oh!

1507
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:10,044
(class laughs)

1508
01:10:13,514 --> 01:10:15,149
- She said yes!

1509
01:10:15,183 --> 01:10:16,517
Oh my gosh, yes!

1510
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:20,154
I am pumped, so awesome.

1511
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:26,293
- Chocolate shake?

1512
01:10:26,326 --> 01:10:28,629
Is this any way to
treat an old friend?

1513
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:33,233
- Wait, this is a bonus hire,
you guys know each other.

1514
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:39,507
- Actually we ran into each
other last night at Rooftops.

1515
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,777
- Yep, these two put
on quite the show.

1516
01:10:44,078 --> 01:10:45,312
- Uh huh.

1517
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:49,217
Congratulations on the
new job as youth pastor.

1518
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,752
- Oh, thank you.

1519
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:54,088
We all seem to be
pretty excited for me.

1520
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:57,658
- Hey, can I show you
guys in the kitchen?

1521
01:10:57,692 --> 01:10:59,861
Someone keeps stealing my yogurt

1522
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:03,698
and I kind of want to
file a formal complaint.

1523
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:05,533
- So what do ya think?

1524
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:08,636
Should you and I make time
for that chocolate shake?

1525
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:10,872
- Chocolate shake.

1526
01:11:10,905 --> 01:11:12,140
Oh.

1527
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:14,709
(laughs) You can get
whatever you want.

1528
01:11:14,742 --> 01:11:16,844
- I know, silly.

1529
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:18,345
I was just thinking

1530
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:21,649
that now that we know I'm
going to be sticking around,

1531
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:26,053
well, a girl could
always use a new friend.

1532
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:27,955
- Friend zone!

1533
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:30,658
- (laughs) No, no,
not necessarily,

1534
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:33,528
but it is the best
place to start.

1535
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:36,764
- Sounds perfect.

1536
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:39,967
- Here is my number.

1537
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,877
Guard this with your life.

1538
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:54,782
- (laughs) I will.

1539
01:11:54,816 --> 01:11:56,217
Trust me, I will.

1540
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:05,358
♪ Lord, Lord, Lord ♪

1541
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:08,129
♪ Praise on thee ♪

1542
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:11,331
- Now I'm telling you,
we're losing our way.

1543
01:12:11,364 --> 01:12:15,036
We're losing our way
because God has a plan!

1544
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,672
No, God has a plan!

1545
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:21,809
Ugh!

1546
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:25,079
That doesn't even feel right.

1547
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:37,191
The son of man,
prophecy against God.

1548
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:38,726
- Look, son, look.

1549
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:44,198
Sometimes you gonna
have to let them know

1550
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:46,200
what you're feeling inside.

1551
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:49,904
Let them know what God himself
might be saying to them.

1552
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:53,774
With the emotions he
might want to be evoking.

1553
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:57,879
Sound disappointed.

1554
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:01,949
Get angry!

1555
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:04,285
See?

1556
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,554
Try again.

1557
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:13,094
- Son of man,
prophecy against God,

1558
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,798
give them this message
from the sovereign Lord.

1559
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:19,399
He has more for us!

1560
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:24,805
You see the devil
comes to deceive us!

1561
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:27,440
We're living longer
on the earth,

1562
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:30,378
but we're not being
more effective!

1563
01:13:32,647 --> 01:13:33,480
Dad, why?

1564
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:36,517
I will not-

1565
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:40,354
- Come on already, don't
just use your voice.

1566
01:13:40,388 --> 01:13:44,759
Let your emotions show on
your face and your eyes.

1567
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:47,494
Use your hands, use your arms,

1568
01:13:47,528 --> 01:13:52,166
let everyone in the room
feel the word of God.

1569
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,901
You hear that?

1570
01:13:53,935 --> 01:13:54,769
Come on.

1571
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:59,573
You can do it, show
me you can do it.

1572
01:13:59,607 --> 01:14:03,044
- Believer, Christian,
I'm talking to you

1573
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:06,914
and I'm talking to me!

1574
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:09,784
When you wake up in
the morning, man,

1575
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,553
all hell ought to shake,

1576
01:14:12,586 --> 01:14:16,757
because the devil should be
thinking, "He's up again.

1577
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,192
"She's up again.

1578
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:22,763
"And he's going to wreak
havoc on the kingdom of hell."

1579
01:14:24,497 --> 01:14:27,568
(Mark groans)

1580
01:14:27,601 --> 01:14:30,938
Jesus, why can't I
make this feel right?

1581
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:36,610
- Um, I think I can help.

1582
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:40,381
- (laughs) There for a
moment I thought you were...

1583
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:41,449
- Oh, yeah, I get it.

1584
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:44,151
I get that all the time.

1585
01:14:44,185 --> 01:14:45,653
Do you mind me asking?

1586
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:48,089
What were you
working on up there?

1587
01:14:48,122 --> 01:14:49,056
- My dad...

1588
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:54,095
My dad always told me the only
way to find your voice was

1589
01:14:54,128 --> 01:14:55,796
to be in the chapel.

1590
01:14:57,365 --> 01:14:59,433
Your voice fills the room.

1591
01:14:59,467 --> 01:15:01,635
It's as if when you speak,

1592
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:06,040
God's speaking
through you himself.

1593
01:15:06,073 --> 01:15:09,076
And then and only then
have you found your voice.

1594
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,946
- All right, and that up there,

1595
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,982
was that you or
your father's voice?

1596
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:20,488
- Probably a little bit of him.

1597
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:22,690
Some other pastors,
to be honest with you.

1598
01:15:22,723 --> 01:15:23,557
- Okay.

1599
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:25,059
So, what about you?

1600
01:15:25,092 --> 01:15:27,862
What does Pastor
Mark sound like?

1601
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:30,664
- That's the thing.

1602
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:34,368
I really have no idea,
to be honest with you.

1603
01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:37,738
- Well, what do you do
during a regular service?

1604
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:39,273
- I mean, there's
so few people here,

1605
01:15:39,306 --> 01:15:42,977
I feel like I can talk
to them individually.

1606
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:49,316
As a friend, about the things
we love and care about.

1607
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,752
- That's a great
start right there.

1608
01:15:51,786 --> 01:15:53,187
- Well, yeah, that's
all great and fine

1609
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,688
when there's so few people here,

1610
01:15:54,722 --> 01:15:57,391
but what are we going to do
if we fill this place up?

1611
01:15:57,425 --> 01:16:00,027
- When you fill this place up.

1612
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:02,797
- Well, okay, that's just it.

1613
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:03,998
When we fill it up,

1614
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,199
how am I going to
speak to those people

1615
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,168
as if they're just one?

1616
01:16:08,335 --> 01:16:11,806
- You know, I just
have a good feeling,

1617
01:16:11,839 --> 01:16:14,742
you're going to know what
to do when that happens.

1618
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,444
- Well, that's kind
of why I'm doing one

1619
01:16:16,477 --> 01:16:18,412
of my Power Team
Ministries this weekend,

1620
01:16:18,446 --> 01:16:22,216
because that ought to
get their attention.

1621
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:23,884
- All right, yeah, I mean,

1622
01:16:23,918 --> 01:16:27,588
that's not exactly what
I was thinking, but okay.

1623
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:28,956
- What, what do you mean?

1624
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:30,791
- What are ya'll doing here?

1625
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:32,259
From 6P to 8P,

1626
01:16:32,293 --> 01:16:36,297
I'm on the schedule for choir
auditions and rehearsals.

1627
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,467
- Yes ma'am, of course
I remember that.

1628
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,369
- Is there any way I could help?

1629
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:45,239
- Well, I tell you, young
Jesus, when the audition starts,

1630
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:47,641
there's gonna be a whole lot
of reaching out to the Lord

1631
01:16:47,675 --> 01:16:49,376
in gospel harmonies.

1632
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:52,813
And I can't promise it's
gonna be all that melodious.

1633
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:54,782
- [Woman] Amen to that, sister.

1634
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:55,649
Yeah.

1635
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:59,854
- I even prayed to the Lord
himself to cover his ears,

1636
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:01,689
until we get through the night.

1637
01:17:01,722 --> 01:17:03,824
So you two might not
want to stick around.

1638
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:04,892
- Yes, ma'am.

1639
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,271
- Yes, if you can
do this quickly,

1640
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:19,940
because we don't have all night.

1641
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:23,344
Thank you very much,
I appreciate that.

1642
01:17:23,377 --> 01:17:26,780
Yep, good job,
good job, good job.

1643
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:28,249
All right, let's get started

1644
01:17:28,282 --> 01:17:30,552
so we can get some
auditions going.

1645
01:17:30,585 --> 01:17:32,521
Now, which one are you?

1646
01:17:34,623 --> 01:17:35,456
- Me?

1647
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:38,993
I'm Whitney.

1648
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:43,532
- All right, Whitney, do you
have any experience singing

1649
01:17:43,565 --> 01:17:45,799
or ever took any lessons?

1650
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:49,436
- Well, I mean, if you count
karaoke and videos online,

1651
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,672
then yeah, I'd say
I'm experienced.

1652
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,841
(members humming)

1653
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:56,477
- What makes you want to
be a part of the choir?

1654
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:57,579
- My husband.

1655
01:17:58,712 --> 01:18:00,549
- Your husband?

1656
01:18:00,582 --> 01:18:02,983
- Yes, ma'am, my husband.

1657
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:06,053
He says I have the
voice of an angel.

1658
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:10,791
- Well, we'll be
the judge of that.

1659
01:18:10,824 --> 01:18:12,561
What are you gonna sing for us?

1660
01:18:12,594 --> 01:18:14,094
- "Amazing Grace."

1661
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:30,545
♪ Amazing grace, how
sweet your sound ♪

1662
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:38,653
♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪

1663
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:42,189
♪ I once was lost

1664
01:18:42,223 --> 01:18:45,392
♪ Was blind but now I see ♪

1665
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:46,894
♪ Twas grace that brought ♪

1666
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:47,962
- Stop!

1667
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:48,929
Stop, stop.

1668
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:55,369
- Her husband is a
pretty good liar.

1669
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,504
(laughs)

1670
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:04,878
- You know, I think we're
gonna need all of these people.

1671
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:09,684
- Otherwise, we're gonna have
a pretty sad choir of four.

1672
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:13,521
- All right, Whitney, you're in.

1673
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:15,856
- Yes!

1674
01:19:18,993 --> 01:19:21,095
- We're gonna put
you in the back.

1675
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:23,764
- Yeah, way in the back.

1676
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:25,634
- Like in the hallway.

1677
01:19:27,034 --> 01:19:29,537
Like as far back as back goes.

1678
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:32,406
- In the back.

1679
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:35,376
- All right, Ann and Caleb,
you two audition together.

1680
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:37,512
You're gonna make it anyway.

1681
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:41,982
♪ Amazing grace, how
sweet the sound ♪

1682
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:54,495
♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪

1683
01:20:02,704 --> 01:20:05,540
♪ I once was lost ♪

1684
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:22,456
- I came from the
car, put my bag down.

1685
01:20:27,461 --> 01:20:28,596
Hey, Jesus?

1686
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:30,064
- [Jesus] Yeah?

1687
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:34,769
- Do you know what I did with
a certain piece of paper?

1688
01:20:34,803 --> 01:20:37,971
- Oh, Lazzy, are you
looking for this?

1689
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,074
- Okay.

1690
01:20:41,842 --> 01:20:43,778
- You know, for how important
that thing is to you,

1691
01:20:43,812 --> 01:20:46,080
I would've thought you would
have saved it in your phone.

1692
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:48,082
You know, with like
a cute ringtone,

1693
01:20:48,115 --> 01:20:51,418
like "Oh, Dee Dee,
my precious Dee Dee!"

1694
01:20:52,386 --> 01:20:53,588
Something like that.

1695
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:55,456
- Yeah, funny, very funny.

1696
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:57,891
It's just this piece of
paper, she touched it.

1697
01:20:57,925 --> 01:21:00,562
This is her handwriting.

1698
01:21:00,595 --> 01:21:02,831
This piece of paper, it's
like a grand romantic gesture.

1699
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:04,331
- Calm down, all right.

1700
01:21:04,365 --> 01:21:05,999
This isn't the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1701
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:08,670
It's her phone number
on a piece of paper.

1702
01:21:08,703 --> 01:21:10,672
Pump the brakes on the
romance train, all right?

1703
01:21:10,705 --> 01:21:13,742
- It's just something
about her, man.

1704
01:21:13,775 --> 01:21:16,076
- All right, well, wasn't
it just yesterday it was,

1705
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,679
"Oh, Chloe!

1706
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:20,414
"I'll never meet
another one like Chloe!"

1707
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:21,750
- But this is different.

1708
01:21:21,783 --> 01:21:24,552
Chloe never wrote down
her number for me.

1709
01:21:24,586 --> 01:21:26,153
In fact, she just
said it really fast.

1710
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:27,789
I had to guess on like
the last three digits.

1711
01:21:27,822 --> 01:21:29,256
I called like 10
different people

1712
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:30,558
before getting through to her.

1713
01:21:30,592 --> 01:21:33,427
- Okay, well, you do
have Dee Dee's number,

1714
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,631
so are you going to
give her a call or what?

1715
01:21:36,664 --> 01:21:38,098
- I don't know, do
you think I should?

1716
01:21:38,132 --> 01:21:41,703
- Uh, no, no, you
shouldn't call her.

1717
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,805
You know, I bet you
that's a fake number.

1718
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:45,038
You know?

1719
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:47,074
Some hotline for a
fake insurance scam

1720
01:21:47,107 --> 01:21:49,644
or some kind of
non-existent rebate program

1721
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:51,546
for a air conditioner
you never got.

1722
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:52,614
- I didn't think
of it like that.

1723
01:21:52,647 --> 01:21:54,281
Is that what this is?

1724
01:21:54,314 --> 01:21:55,115
- Laz!

1725
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:56,684
No, dude!

1726
01:21:56,718 --> 01:21:59,953
I talked to Dee Dee at church
and she's a really nice girl.

1727
01:21:59,987 --> 01:22:01,790
She would never do that to you.

1728
01:22:01,823 --> 01:22:04,826
- I just, I, it's a fake number.

1729
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:05,627
- [Jesus] Oh, Lazzy?

1730
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,960
- Yeah?

1731
01:22:06,994 --> 01:22:08,696
- It's ringing.

1732
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,697
You better answer.
- No.

1733
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:11,800
- Take it.
- I can't.

1734
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,367
I don't know what to say!

1735
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,536
(shouting)

1736
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:15,502
Okay, fine!

1737
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:17,705
Hi.

1738
01:22:17,739 --> 01:22:20,174
- Hello, friend zone hotline.

1739
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:23,343
- Funny, very funny.

1740
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:27,981
- Well, it's important to see
if you have a sense of humor.

1741
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:29,918
- I guess that just depends

1742
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,319
on how long you plan on
keeping me in the friend zone.

1743
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:35,255
- Well, I suppose
that all depends

1744
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:39,493
on how long it takes
for you to ask me out.

1745
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:40,994
- I think she wants
me to ask her out.

1746
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:41,930
- Well, hot dog!

1747
01:22:41,962 --> 01:22:43,798
What are you looking at me for?

1748
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:44,766
Say yes, say yes.

1749
01:22:44,799 --> 01:22:45,633
- Okay.

1750
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:51,305
Um, how does Sunday
night after church sound?

1751
01:22:51,338 --> 01:22:53,908
- Perfect, that's what
I was going to suggest

1752
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:57,779
if you ended up making
me have to ask you out.

1753
01:22:59,714 --> 01:23:01,248
- She said yes.

1754
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:02,684
- Hey!

1755
01:23:02,717 --> 01:23:03,685
Whoa!
- Whoa!

1756
01:23:06,386 --> 01:23:07,789
- My boy Laz!

1757
01:23:07,822 --> 01:23:09,524
- [Laz] I don't
know what to wear.

1758
01:23:09,557 --> 01:23:10,457
- What did I tell you?

1759
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:11,593
No shirt, lot of chest hair.

1760
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:12,993
Do you have chest hair?

1761
01:23:13,026 --> 01:23:14,596
We can draw some on.

1762
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:18,298
Get your marker, we're
going to have some fun.

1763
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:21,068
(dramatic music)

1764
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,752
- Hey, hey, hey.

1765
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:40,153
Cacaw, cacaw, hey, hey, hey.

1766
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:42,155
(whistles) Hey.

1767
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:44,024
Cacaw, cacaw, come on.

1768
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:49,296
- Jade, Caleb, what are you
two doing here so early?

1769
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:54,334
- Well, you know, this is our
first service to record, so...

1770
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:57,739
- Right, yeah, we just wanted
to check out a couple of spots

1771
01:23:57,772 --> 01:24:01,609
and decide which is the
best angle to shoot from.

1772
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:03,645
- Oh, I love that idea!

1773
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:05,880
Especially today,
because you can capture

1774
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:09,116
the strong man segments
of the service.

1775
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,051
- Yeah, right, yeah.
- Right, yes.

1776
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:13,387
- Yeah, totally, yes.

1777
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,456
- Right, really
excited to see that.

1778
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:20,227
Whoa, hey, where are
you going with that?

1779
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:24,032
- [Mark] To have it on the
pulpit for later in the service.

1780
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:27,334
- Why don't you let
us take that and...

1781
01:24:29,469 --> 01:24:31,639
- Yeah, you probably
need to get focused

1782
01:24:31,673 --> 01:24:33,541
and ready for the big event.

1783
01:24:33,575 --> 01:24:35,309
- Thank you.

1784
01:24:35,342 --> 01:24:37,344
How thoughtful of those guys.

1785
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:38,211
- Mm-hm.

1786
01:24:45,019 --> 01:24:46,588
- Did you see that?

1787
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:49,891
That was so nice!

1788
01:24:49,924 --> 01:24:52,727
And they got here so early!

1789
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,830
- Yeah, maybe it's
a little too nice.

1790
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:01,201
- Oh!

1791
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:02,070
Oh.

1792
01:25:05,172 --> 01:25:06,941
- Let me help you
with that, Mrs. Elsie.

1793
01:25:06,975 --> 01:25:08,475
- Oh, praise the Lord.

1794
01:25:08,509 --> 01:25:09,711
- Of course.

1795
01:25:09,744 --> 01:25:11,946
- Jesus, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

1796
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,681
- You don't know how
often I hear that.

spirit is strong for Jesus ♪

- Do you have any idea what
we should even ask people?

1816
01:26:33,094 --> 01:26:33,895
- No!

1817

(mic screeches)

1818
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:38,198
Not really.

1819
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,368
I just know we need to
get someone to talk to us

1820
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:43,571
so we can get out of here.

1821
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:53,648
Mrs. Elsie, would you mind
coming over here for a minute?

1822
01:26:55,116 --> 01:26:57,552
- The choir sounded really
great today, Mrs. Elsie.

1823
01:26:57,585 --> 01:26:58,886
- Thank you, Caleb.

1824
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,023
We can only work with
the talents God gave us.

1825
01:27:02,056 --> 01:27:04,291
Some of us more than others.

1826
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:08,963
- Mrs. Elsie, would you mind
helping us on a little project?

1827
01:27:08,996 --> 01:27:10,363
- Why, of course.

1828
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:12,100
What's this gonna be about?

1829
01:27:12,133 --> 01:27:14,334
- The church is creating
a new social media site

1830
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:15,803
on the internet.

1831
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:18,973
- And we need a comment or
two from people at the church

1832
01:27:19,006 --> 01:27:21,042
telling us why they
like going here.

1833
01:27:21,075 --> 01:27:22,275
- Sounds easy enough.

1834
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:23,878
Go ahead, ask away.

1835
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:34,287
- Mrs. Elsie, have you met
the new church handyman?

1836
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:35,823
- Jesus?

1837
01:27:35,857 --> 01:27:38,391
Why, just this morning, as
I walked through the doors

1838
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:42,429
of our Friends of Faith Church,
he personally greeted me

1839
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:47,135
with open arms and helped
take a load off right away.

1840
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:51,572
It would have been a terrible
go without Jesus' help.

1841
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,275
- Thank you, thank
you, Mrs. Elsie.

1842
01:27:55,308 --> 01:27:57,211
That was perfect.

1843
01:27:57,245 --> 01:27:59,379

1857
01:28:41,022 --> 01:28:42,123
- Wow!

1858
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:43,591
I mean, can you believe it?

1859
01:28:43,624 --> 01:28:47,962
From milkshake mustache to
being here for our first date.

1860
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:52,332
- Yeah, I wish I was a
little bit more alluring.

1861
01:28:52,365 --> 01:28:53,466
- Are you kidding?

1862
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,236
That was so cute.

1863
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:56,469
I mean, I'm going
to tell that story

1864
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:58,673
for the rest of my life.

1865
01:28:58,706 --> 01:29:01,441
- Right, cute,
just like a puppy.

1866
01:29:03,144 --> 01:29:05,913
- Aww, but puppies
are so lovable.

1867
01:29:07,615 --> 01:29:10,051
(Laz laughs)

1868
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:13,087
- So what makes you want
to be a youth pastor?

1869
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,122
- Well, I mean, I guess
I feel like kids have

1870
01:29:15,156 --> 01:29:18,226
a hard enough time figuring
out themselves already,

1871
01:29:18,259 --> 01:29:20,094
much less learning about faith.

1872
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:21,662
- [Laz] No, yeah,
I can see that.

1873
01:29:21,696 --> 01:29:24,565
- So, I kind of want to be the
one to help bridge the gap,

1874
01:29:24,599 --> 01:29:25,933
by giving them ideas

1875
01:29:25,967 --> 01:29:28,368
that they'd be more
interested in learning about.

1876
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:32,707
Ideas that might help them
see that believing can be fun,

1877
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,976
and empowering, and helpful.

1878
01:29:35,009 --> 01:29:37,278
- I love that you
see it like that.

1879
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:38,579
- Well, what about you?

1880
01:29:38,613 --> 01:29:41,349
- The dream is to
create a platform

1881
01:29:41,381 --> 01:29:45,219
for just all positive
things, you know,

1882
01:29:45,253 --> 01:29:47,788
happy news, praying
for one another,

1883
01:29:47,822 --> 01:29:50,524
good things you like
about your church.

1884
01:29:50,558 --> 01:29:54,161
Just no negativity, I
want positivity there.

1885
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:57,265
- Wow, I mean, that
will be amazing.

1886
01:29:57,298 --> 01:29:58,799
I love that idea.

1887
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,202
You must be pretty
proud of yourself.

1888
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:05,339
- Yeah, uh, I just wish
everyone thought like you did.

1889
01:30:05,373 --> 01:30:07,541
- Oh, you must mean Chloe.

1890
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:12,780
- What, nah, I mean, yeah.

1891
01:30:14,782 --> 01:30:17,852
- It's okay, Jesus
told me about her.

1892
01:30:18,953 --> 01:30:19,754
- Did he?

1893
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:20,888
Really?

1894
01:30:20,922 --> 01:30:23,791
- Yeah, and he also told me

1895
01:30:23,824 --> 01:30:27,228
about the underwear in
the street incident.

1896
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:28,596
- Did he say anything else?

1897
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:30,031
- Yes.

1898
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:33,801
He might have mentioned
what condition they were in.

1899
01:30:33,834 --> 01:30:36,871
- (laughs) They were an old pair

1900
01:30:36,904 --> 01:30:39,941
that I used like to
wash my car with them.

1901

(blows nose)

1917
01:31:42,803 --> 01:31:45,039
- Pastor Mark, believe me,

1918
01:31:45,072 --> 01:31:46,941
we appreciate all
you've done for us,

1919
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:50,978
but we just keep ending
up at the same dead end.

1920
01:31:52,913 --> 01:31:54,315
- Oh my God, see?

1921
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,651
She just sees everything
going nowhere,

1922
01:31:57,685 --> 01:31:59,720
but the world is
changing every day.

1923
01:31:59,754 --> 01:32:02,089
And so, throughout
time so will we,

1924
01:32:02,123 --> 01:32:04,225
so will our relationship.

1925
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:08,629
- Right, like you losing
weight, buying that new car,

1926
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,900
and that stupid, stupid hat.

1927
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:15,503
(crying)

1928
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:19,974
Why don't you just tell me
you've found someone else?

1929
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,477
- Because there's no one else.

1930
01:32:23,512 --> 01:32:28,282
I just want us to have fun,
you know, like we used to.

1931
01:32:28,315 --> 01:32:31,819
- See, there's just
no reasoning with him.

1932
01:32:36,657 --> 01:32:38,325
- Tina, please stop.

1933
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:39,960
- Kevin, I swear...

1934
01:32:40,828 --> 01:32:44,665
- Oh dear, (groans) my wrist.

1935
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,270
Hey, do you guys mind helping
me out for just one second?

1936
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:51,705
Here, you, you grab this.

1937
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:55,242
Kevin, you get this
mop bucket right here.

1938
01:32:57,278 --> 01:32:58,712
That's...

1939
01:32:58,746 --> 01:33:01,215
You guys are really
sweet for helping me out.

1940
01:33:01,248 --> 01:33:02,716
You know, it's funny,

1941
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,252
you don't realize
how tough life can be

1942
01:33:05,286 --> 01:33:08,189
until part of you feels
like it's missing.

1943
01:33:08,222 --> 01:33:09,356
You know?

1944
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:11,459
Usually, I do my
mopping with this hand

1945
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:13,494
and this hand does the wringing.

1946
01:33:13,528 --> 01:33:15,096
You know, God put 'em together

1947
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:16,964
because they're meant
to work together.

1948
01:33:16,997 --> 01:33:18,632
Like peanut butter and jelly

1949
01:33:18,666 --> 01:33:22,603
or multiple cat
ownership and hoarding.

1950
01:33:22,636 --> 01:33:23,971
Look at you two.

1951
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,708
God bless the both of you.

1952
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:29,710
Thank you for your kindness.

1953
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:32,346
(grunts) Loving the teamwork!

1954
01:33:32,379 --> 01:33:34,748
(groans)

1955
01:33:34,782 --> 01:33:36,383
I'm going to grab some ice.

1956
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:38,719
Don't forget to finish the
halls, and the kitchenette,

1957
01:33:38,752 --> 01:33:39,854
and the bathrooms.

1958
01:33:39,887 --> 01:33:40,721

still talk about me?

01:34:24,832 --> 01:34:25,666
- Uh...

1974
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:28,335
- I'm Jesus.

1975
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:35,544
- (laughs) Sure, Jesus.

1976
01:34:35,577 --> 01:34:37,144
Nice to meet you.

1977
01:34:37,178 --> 01:34:39,648
This is my boyfriend, Reed.

1978
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,814
- Boy...

1979
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:41,650
- You'll have to forgive him.

1980
01:34:41,682 --> 01:34:43,150
Very important call.

1981
01:34:43,184 --> 01:34:44,785
Being the vice president
of the bank his dad owns,

1982
01:34:44,818 --> 01:34:47,121
means he's always
busy, busy, busy.

1983
01:34:47,154 --> 01:34:50,991
- I didn't know you still
went to church here.

1984
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:53,861
- Church?
- Here.

1985
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:56,030
- Here?
- Here.

1986
01:34:57,064 --> 01:34:58,866
- Don't be silly, Laz.

1987
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:01,168
Reed's dad just asked if we
would check in on attendance,

1988
01:35:01,202 --> 01:35:03,804
see if there's any hope
left for this old relic

1989
01:35:03,837 --> 01:35:05,372
of prayers gone by.

1990
01:35:06,974 --> 01:35:09,476
And it's not looking too good.

1991
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:13,347
Anyway, I hear there's plans

1992
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,816
to put a new church
in its place.

1993
01:35:15,849 --> 01:35:19,521
It will be a splendor
for God and all to see.

1994
01:35:19,554 --> 01:35:20,888
- [Reed] Uh huh.

1995
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:23,857
- Well, I guess we'll
see you in there.

1996
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:24,792
- [Laz] Okay.

1997
01:35:24,825 --> 01:35:27,027
- We won't be easy to miss.

1998
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:28,929
- Oh.

1999
01:35:30,364 --> 01:35:31,732
That was Chloe.

2000
01:35:31,765 --> 01:35:32,601
- Uh huh.

2001
01:35:34,068 --> 01:35:37,572
- Did you see her new boyfriend
and how many layers he has?

2002
01:35:37,606 --> 01:35:38,505
- If it makes you
feel any better,

2003
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:40,709
I didn't care for any of them.

2004
01:35:40,741 --> 01:35:42,376
- But it looks like Rylee
is doing really good

2005
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:44,278
with the kids.

2006
01:35:44,311 --> 01:35:46,747
- She's definitely a godsend.

2007
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,618
- Phew, smells like we have
a real winner over here.

2008
01:35:49,651 --> 01:35:51,586
(laughs)

2009
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,753
- [Hope] You might
want to save yourself

2010
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:54,689
and get on out of here.

2011
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:59,460
- Whenever I have a kid, I
am not feeding my little lady

2012
01:35:59,493 --> 01:36:01,829
whatever this little
lady has been eating.

2013
01:36:01,862 --> 01:36:03,464
Whew!

2014
01:36:03,497 --> 01:36:04,699
Oh my goodness.

2015
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:07,468
- You're doing a
great job, Rylee.

2016
01:36:07,501 --> 01:36:09,203
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

2017
01:36:09,236 --> 01:36:10,070
- Oh man.

2018
01:36:13,608 --> 01:36:14,441
Hi.

2019
01:36:16,076 --> 01:36:17,077
Hi.

2020
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:19,246
Oh, you're so cute!

2021
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,683
(phone chimes)

2022
01:36:21,716 --> 01:36:23,817
- Rylee, please no text or calls

2023
01:36:23,851 --> 01:36:26,253
while we're watching the kids.

2024
01:36:26,287 --> 01:36:29,658
- Oh my gosh, Margo is
always so scandalous.

2025
01:36:29,691 --> 01:36:31,492
She saw Tristen at the
dinner with another girl,

2026
01:36:31,526 --> 01:36:33,628
but he already told me that
he was meeting his cousins

2027
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:35,929
for breakfast this morning.

2028
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:44,038

(blocks crash)

2030
01:36:51,211 --> 01:36:54,381
- All right, all right,
let's make a truce here.

2031
01:36:54,415 --> 01:36:57,585
Jimmy, I want you to
go help Ms. Rylee.

2032
01:36:57,619 --> 01:36:58,452
- Okay.

2034
01:37:24,746 --> 01:37:26,113

I'm so sorry.

2036
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,315
- Rylee, please.

2037
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:40,894
- I'm sorry, I
gotta go, I'm sorry.

2038
01:37:40,928 --> 01:37:41,995
- [Hope] Rylee!

2039

two young people today,

2068
01:39:47,187 --> 01:39:50,357
offer a little helpful
romance advice?

2069

No, no.

2071
01:39:55,429 --> 01:39:57,097
We're making videos
to help the church

2072
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:59,066
with some of their
social media presence.

2073
01:39:59,099 --> 01:40:00,501
And we were hoping

2074
01:40:00,535 --> 01:40:03,203
you wouldn't mind us
asking a question or two.

2075
01:40:03,237 --> 01:40:05,807
- We'd be happy to help.

2076
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,007
- Great, okay.

2077
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,176
Have you guys had the chance

2078
01:40:09,209 --> 01:40:12,246
to meet the new church handyman?

2079
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:14,014
- You go first.
- You go first.

2080
01:40:14,047 --> 01:40:15,750
- Jinx!
- Jinx!

2081

2082
01:40:17,317 --> 01:40:19,453
- Okay, I'll go first.

2083
01:40:19,486 --> 01:40:21,455
As a matter of fact,
Kevin and I were going

2084
01:40:21,488 --> 01:40:23,858
to Friends of Faith for
marriage counseling.

2085
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:27,829
- Yeah, our communication
just wasn't jibing up.

2086
01:40:27,862 --> 01:40:29,196
- But it is now.

2087
01:40:30,163 --> 01:40:33,100
- And it's all thanks to Jesus.

2088
01:40:33,133 --> 01:40:34,836
- After counseling one day,

2089
01:40:34,869 --> 01:40:37,639
Jesus showed us how much fun
working together really meant

2090
01:40:37,672 --> 01:40:39,007
to each of us.

2091
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:40,474
- And ever since he said that,

2092
01:40:40,508 --> 01:40:44,746
we just felt love and
warmth all over again.

2093
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:47,414
Thank you, Jesus!
- Thank you, Jesus!

2094
01:40:47,447 --> 01:40:50,818
For helping us at
Friends of Faith.

2095
01:40:50,852 --> 01:40:53,655
You two should
think about dating.

2096
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:56,991
- Oh.

2097
01:40:57,025 --> 01:40:58,325
- Right in the mush.

2098
01:40:58,358 --> 01:40:59,426
- Yeah, gosh!

2099
01:41:00,628 --> 01:41:02,030
- Is it bad that
I'm enjoying this?

2100
01:41:02,062 --> 01:41:03,898
- Oh no, no, no, no.

2101
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:06,266
This is, this is pure.

2102
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,002
This is pure comedy.

2103
01:41:08,036 --> 01:41:09,571
Would anyone like
something to drink?

2104
01:41:09,604 --> 01:41:11,873
- I'll take a glass of
wine if you have any.

2105
01:41:11,906 --> 01:41:15,175
- I think we only
have beer and water,

2106
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:16,578
but I'll take a beer, thank you.

2107
01:41:16,611 --> 01:41:18,546
- I'll go check.
- Okay.

2108
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,922
- Looks like we
do have some wine.

2109
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:28,790
- Awesome.

2110
01:41:29,691 --> 01:41:32,627
(triumphant music)

2111
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,497
- [Jesus] We're in luck.

2112
01:41:37,532 --> 01:41:39,834
I was actually able
to find some red wine.

2113
01:41:39,867 --> 01:41:40,702
- Awesome!

2114
01:41:41,769 --> 01:41:43,771
Thank you.
- Here you go.

2115
01:41:48,543 --> 01:41:49,811
- That is really good.

2116
01:41:49,844 --> 01:41:50,878
Who makes it?

2117
01:41:50,912 --> 01:41:52,145
- I do.

2118
01:41:52,179 --> 01:41:54,882
I mean, uh, I do
some home brewing.

2119
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:56,951
- Oh, well, I hope there's more,

2120
01:41:56,985 --> 01:42:00,955
because I think I'm going
to want another glass.

2121
01:42:02,023 --> 01:42:03,323
- I can make as much,

2122
01:42:03,357 --> 01:42:05,560
I mean I can get as
much as you'd like.

2123
01:42:05,593 --> 01:42:08,495
There's plenty in the fridge.

2124
01:42:08,529 --> 01:42:11,298
- Oh my gosh, you guys are
not going to believe this.

2125
01:42:11,331 --> 01:42:12,533
- What's that?

2126
01:42:12,567 --> 01:42:14,368
- This video of the
diaper is going viral

2127
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:16,671
right before our eyes.

2128
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:20,675
Wait, all of the
videos have gone viral.

2129
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:21,876
- Jesus?

2130
01:42:21,909 --> 01:42:22,710
Oh lord!

2131
01:42:23,978 --> 01:42:26,213
I met Jesus at Friends of Faith.

2132
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:28,783
You might say he gave
me the fuel I needed

2133
01:42:28,816 --> 01:42:31,586
to travel down the
righteous road of life.

2134
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:33,220
And the man knows his tools too.

2135
01:42:33,253 --> 01:42:35,823
Boy, I tell you,
that's my Jesus!

2136
01:42:35,857 --> 01:42:37,391
- Do you remember
talking to that guy?

2137
01:42:37,424 --> 01:42:39,727
- (laughs) Yeah, I do.

2138
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:40,828
He's a good guy.

2139
01:42:40,862 --> 01:42:42,664
Actually, he's a
decent mechanic.

2140
01:42:42,697 --> 01:42:44,197
I showed him a
picture of your hoopty

2141
01:42:44,231 --> 01:42:46,433
and he thinks he
can help you out.

2142
01:42:46,466 --> 01:42:47,769
- Jesus.

2143
01:42:47,802 --> 01:42:48,703
- What?

2144
01:42:48,736 --> 01:42:50,504
- Oh, no, sorry, not you.

2145
01:42:50,538 --> 01:42:52,807
Do you mind?
- Oh, sure.

2146
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,576
What do you think is going on?

2147
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:58,746
- I didn't think to
go and check this yet.

2148
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:01,115
I thought it would
be way to soon.

2149
01:43:01,149 --> 01:43:03,017
- Too soon for what?
- Too soon for what?

2150
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:03,851
- Sorry.

2151
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:06,654
This is a miracle.

2152
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,122
- What is?
- What is?

2153
01:43:08,156 --> 01:43:10,257
- Uh, sorry, it's...

2154
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:13,360
Friends of Faith has
over 300,000 followers.

2155
01:43:13,393 --> 01:43:14,829
- Oh my Dad!

2156
01:43:14,862 --> 01:43:17,965
That's more followers
than Moses had!

2157
01:43:21,268 --> 01:43:23,437
- I wonder, I just wonder.

2158
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,141
- Wonder what?
- Wonder what?

2159
01:43:27,175 --> 01:43:28,475
Okay, you're going
to have to work

2160
01:43:28,509 --> 01:43:30,044
on your communication skills

2161
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:33,915
if this thing between
us is going to work out.

2162
01:43:33,948 --> 01:43:36,249
- Um, when I set up the site,

2163
01:43:36,283 --> 01:43:37,785
I didn't think it
would be a bad idea

2164
01:43:37,819 --> 01:43:39,654
to put a donation function

2165
01:43:39,687 --> 01:43:41,823
just in case anyone
visiting wanted to help out

2166
01:43:41,856 --> 01:43:43,124
with the cause.

2167
01:43:45,258 --> 01:43:47,061
(laughs) I have to
call Pastor Mark

2168
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:49,329
and tell him the good news.

2169
01:43:53,534 --> 01:43:55,770
(phone ringing)

2170
01:43:55,803 --> 01:43:58,206
(calm music)

2171
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,417
- Laz, hey, what can
I do for you, son?

2172
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:12,186
- (laughs) Where to start?

2173
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,988
- [Mark] Is everything okay?

2174
01:44:14,021 --> 01:44:15,690
- No, it's more than all right.

2175
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:17,925
The social media
site is blowing up.

2176
01:44:17,959 --> 01:44:19,560
Tons of people are
following the church

2177
01:44:19,594 --> 01:44:22,462
and watching all the videos.

2178
01:44:22,496 --> 01:44:24,932
- Okay, so, that's
good news, right?

2179
01:44:24,966 --> 01:44:29,237
What are we talking, like
one or maybe two hundred?

2180
01:44:30,403 --> 01:44:33,373
- No, sir, try, um,
try over 300,000.

2181
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:35,442
- 300,000?

2182
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,014
What, what?

2183
01:44:41,883 --> 01:44:44,619
- 300,000, and that's
not even the best part.

2184
01:44:44,652 --> 01:44:45,953
- [Mark] There's more?

2185
01:44:45,987 --> 01:44:49,023
- Yes sir, try 25,000 more.

2186
01:44:49,056 --> 01:44:50,625
Dollars, that is.

2187
01:44:50,658 --> 01:44:51,491
- $25,000?

2188
01:44:53,528 --> 01:44:57,265
Is that what we have to
pay for those followers?

2189
01:44:57,297 --> 01:45:00,134
- (laughs) No sir, that's what
those followers are donating

2190
01:45:00,168 --> 01:45:01,334
to the church.

2191
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:04,639
- Praise the Lord.

2192
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:09,342
I can't hardly
believe this, Laz.

2193
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:11,378
- Well, believe it,
'cause it's real.

2194
01:45:11,411 --> 01:45:13,614
Do you think this will be
enough to keep the bank happy

2195
01:45:13,648 --> 01:45:15,750
until we get some more?

2196
01:45:15,783 --> 01:45:18,719
- I don't know, but I'm
gonna call Jack first thing

2197
01:45:18,753 --> 01:45:20,988
in the morning and find out.

2198
01:45:21,022 --> 01:45:23,024
Praise the Lord, Laz.

2199
01:45:23,057 --> 01:45:25,492
God bless you, God bless you!

2200
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,671
Siri, Siri, you're not
going to believe this!

2201
01:45:36,704 --> 01:45:38,172
- I tell you what, Mark,

2202
01:45:38,206 --> 01:45:41,209
I'm so glad this worked
out in the church's favor.

2203
01:45:41,242 --> 01:45:45,046
I was pulling for
you the whole time.

2204
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:46,881
- I appreciate that, Jack.

2205
01:45:46,914 --> 01:45:48,448
Hey, you sticking around
for service today?

2206
01:45:48,481 --> 01:45:50,483
- Wouldn't miss it.

2207
01:45:50,518 --> 01:45:53,087
The wife is saving us
a place right up front.

2208
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,256
- Well, that's good,
good, good, good.

2209
01:45:55,289 --> 01:45:56,624
That's good.

2210
01:45:56,657 --> 01:45:58,559
(grunts)

2211
01:45:58,593 --> 01:46:00,995
Okay, I'll see you
in there, man, okay?

2212
01:46:01,028 --> 01:46:01,863
All right.

2213
01:46:07,702 --> 01:46:09,737
- That little
fella looked happy.

2214
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:11,772
- Yeah, I'm not sure if it's
because he got his check

2215
01:46:11,806 --> 01:46:14,208
or because he's
actually rooting for us.

2216
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:16,544
- It's probably a
little bit of both.

2217
01:46:16,577 --> 01:46:18,913
So how's that preacher
voice coming along?

2218
01:46:18,946 --> 01:46:21,816
Looks like the perfect
crowd to try it out on.

2219
01:46:21,849 --> 01:46:23,150
- Huh?

2220
01:46:23,184 --> 01:46:24,652
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2221
01:46:24,685 --> 01:46:28,689
Well, to be perfectly honest
with you, I'm scared to death.

2222
01:46:28,723 --> 01:46:30,124
- Why would you feel like that?

2223
01:46:30,157 --> 01:46:31,292
I thought this is

2224
01:46:31,325 --> 01:46:33,895
what you've been working
towards all along?

2225
01:46:33,928 --> 01:46:35,395
- I just keep thinking

2226
01:46:35,428 --> 01:46:38,866
about how my dad would've
handled this big moment.

2227
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,769
- And what'd you come up with?

2228
01:46:41,802 --> 01:46:43,938
- Always I seem to come up
with something different

2229
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:47,041
than what I think I should do.

2230
01:46:47,074 --> 01:46:48,576
- Listen, you've always feared

2231
01:46:48,609 --> 01:46:50,878
that you've shared
something with your dad,

2232
01:46:50,912 --> 01:46:53,180
but you're only here today

2233
01:46:53,214 --> 01:46:56,150
because that memory
brought you here.

2234
01:46:56,183 --> 01:46:58,185
- I can't even remember.

2235
01:46:59,587 --> 01:47:01,923
- Mark, you're not your dad.

2236
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:06,560
You're your father's
son and that's it.

2237
01:47:06,594 --> 01:47:08,296
You're a reflection of him,

2238
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:10,932
just like he was to his father.

2239
01:47:12,767 --> 01:47:14,769
Dude, you get to decide.

2240
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:18,706
You get to decide the
best parts of him.

2241
01:47:18,739 --> 01:47:21,809
The parts of him
that get to live on.

2242
01:47:21,842 --> 01:47:24,712
They get to live
on in this church.

2243
01:47:24,745 --> 01:47:27,248
This church that you now lead.

2244
01:47:33,921 --> 01:47:37,658
- Looks like you have
a full house out there.

2245
01:47:40,361 --> 01:47:41,195
- Oh, hi!

2246
01:47:44,265 --> 01:47:46,867
- It's going to be okay.

2247
01:47:46,901 --> 01:47:49,637
I think you're
going to do great.

2248
01:47:52,039 --> 01:47:53,941
We better be in place
in about 10 minutes.

2249
01:47:53,975 --> 01:47:55,543
- Yeah.

2250
01:47:55,576 --> 01:47:56,711
- I love you.

2251
01:47:56,744 --> 01:47:58,179
- I love you too.

2252
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,949
- Oh, and hey!

2253
01:48:01,983 --> 01:48:04,285
Don't forget to break a leg.

2254
01:48:13,561 --> 01:48:14,895
- Oh, dadgummit.

2255
01:48:16,464 --> 01:48:18,132
Gotta get a pen now.

2256
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:19,900
Geez.

2257
01:48:25,606 --> 01:48:27,108
- Hey!

2258
01:48:27,141 --> 01:48:30,244
Looks like we've got a lot of
people coming to church today.

2259
01:48:30,277 --> 01:48:32,313
- Yeah, sounds like it's
going to be a full house.

2260
01:48:32,346 --> 01:48:34,915
- Yeah, maybe you and your
videos may have something

2261
01:48:34,949 --> 01:48:36,150
to do with it.

2262
01:48:36,183 --> 01:48:37,418
- Look, we were only trying to-

2263
01:48:37,451 --> 01:48:40,621
- I know what you
were trying to do.

2264
01:48:40,654 --> 01:48:43,657
I watched all your
videos this week.

2265
01:48:45,459 --> 01:48:47,061
- It might have
started out as a prank,

2266
01:48:47,094 --> 01:48:49,997
but the videos started
getting so much attention.

2267
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:52,600
- Yeah, we just didn't
think we should stop.

2268
01:48:52,633 --> 01:48:54,769
- Well, I guess it's a
good thing you didn't,

2269
01:48:54,802 --> 01:48:57,138
because what started
out as a prank,

2270
01:48:57,171 --> 01:49:00,174
made all these people
interested in Jesus.

2271
01:49:00,207 --> 01:49:02,043
- You want us to stop?

2272
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:05,046
'Cause we really
enjoy doing this.

2273
01:49:05,079 --> 01:49:09,383
- No, but next time,
maybe use your talents

2274
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:12,053
with good intentions first.

2275
01:49:12,086 --> 01:49:13,054
- Yes, ma'am.

2276
01:49:13,087 --> 01:49:14,255
- Yes, ma'am.

2277
01:49:14,288 --> 01:49:16,924
- All right, let's
see what you got here.

2278
01:49:16,957 --> 01:49:19,560
(upbeat music)

2279
01:49:26,634 --> 01:49:29,136
(Mark grunts)

2280
01:49:35,176 --> 01:49:36,545
- God!

2281
01:49:36,577 --> 01:49:37,845
No, no, no, no!

2282
01:49:47,388 --> 01:49:48,557
Hey, hey, hey!

2283
01:49:49,657 --> 01:49:51,058
Help, help, help!

2284
01:49:53,094 --> 01:49:54,995
- Oh, hey, look,
its Pastor Mark!

2285
01:49:55,029 --> 01:49:57,665
- Oh, he looks so excited
for the service today!

2286
01:49:57,698 --> 01:49:59,333
- We'll see you in there!

2287
01:49:59,366 --> 01:50:00,434
- Help, help!

2288
01:50:02,603 --> 01:50:04,405
I just came to get some pens.

2289
01:50:04,438 --> 01:50:05,673
I mean, really.

2290
01:50:07,975 --> 01:50:09,610
(pens clatter)

2291
01:50:09,643 --> 01:50:12,146
(Mark groans)

2292
01:50:13,347 --> 01:50:14,181
Gosh!

2293
01:50:15,883 --> 01:50:20,054
Lord, why does everything
have to be so difficult?

2294
01:50:21,388 --> 01:50:22,890
Every single time!

2295
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:30,231
- [Jesus] A memory that
helped lead you here.

2296
01:50:31,566 --> 01:50:34,001
- Why are you so hard on him?

2297
01:50:34,869 --> 01:50:37,271
- Because leading a church...

2298
01:50:39,106 --> 01:50:42,409
Leading a congregation
is not an easy thing.

2299
01:50:42,443 --> 01:50:46,780
- Sure, but to insist that
he lead just the way you do?

2300
01:50:46,814 --> 01:50:49,783
- That's the way
my daddy taught me.

2301
01:50:52,786 --> 01:50:56,591
- And I suppose that's the way
you continue to preach today?

2302
01:50:56,625 --> 01:50:57,825
Come on!

2303
01:50:57,858 --> 01:50:59,894
- Well, no, but it's important

2304
01:50:59,927 --> 01:51:02,363
that he understands our history.

2305
01:51:02,396 --> 01:51:04,198
- History, schmistory.

2306
01:51:04,231 --> 01:51:07,034
Things are changing and
will continue to change,

2307
01:51:07,067 --> 01:51:09,403
just like when we were kids.

2308
01:51:17,344 --> 01:51:18,746
Remember all the disagreements

2309
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:21,550
you and your dad used to have?

2310
01:51:21,583 --> 01:51:23,017
I think you forget sometimes

2311
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:25,019
that I have been around
form the very beginning.

2312
01:51:25,052 --> 01:51:26,053
- Yes, dear.

2313
01:51:27,888 --> 01:51:30,592
- Well, is that what you want?

2314
01:51:30,625 --> 01:51:32,293
- No, of course not.

2315
01:51:36,665 --> 01:51:38,465
(coughs)

2316
01:51:38,499 --> 01:51:40,167
- Then what do you want?

2317
01:51:40,201 --> 01:51:41,536
- I just want...

2318
01:51:46,006 --> 01:51:50,512
I want him to be strong enough
to develop his own voice

2319
01:51:50,545 --> 01:51:53,280
so that he can
experience the joy

2320
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:57,785
that I have serving the
Lord in this church.

2321
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:02,289
- There now, was
that so hard to say?

2322
01:52:04,225 --> 01:52:07,061
- No, I'll wake him
up, we'll have a talk.

2323
01:52:07,094 --> 01:52:09,664
- Let him be, we'll talk later.

2324
01:52:17,137 --> 01:52:19,773
- I just thought that
was something I wished

2325
01:52:19,807 --> 01:52:21,208
or dreamed about.

2326
01:52:23,043 --> 01:52:25,346
I've gotta get out of here.

2327
01:52:25,379 --> 01:52:26,213
Right now.

2328
01:52:42,664 --> 01:52:45,199
I can't believe I'm doing this.

2329
01:52:45,232 --> 01:52:48,135
This never ends
well in the movies.

2330
01:53:00,615 --> 01:53:01,849
- Can you believe it?

2331
01:53:01,882 --> 01:53:02,883
I mean, all the
people out there?

2332
01:53:02,916 --> 01:53:03,718
- I know!

2333
01:53:03,752 --> 01:53:05,319
I'm so proud of you.

2334
01:53:07,622 --> 01:53:11,292
Your site brought all
these people together.

2335
01:53:11,325 --> 01:53:14,061
- Well, I had a
little bit of help.

2336
01:53:14,094 --> 01:53:16,130
- Yeah, but still.

2337
01:53:16,163 --> 01:53:21,068
You had a dream and you're
making it all come true.

2338
01:53:21,101 --> 01:53:22,637
- It was the moment I met you.

2339
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:26,273
That's when it all
started coming true.

2340
01:53:26,307 --> 01:53:30,144
- Well, I guess I should
go back to the kids.

2341
01:53:30,177 --> 01:53:31,011
- Yeah.

2342
01:53:32,046 --> 01:53:33,480
Yeah, yeah.

2343
01:53:33,515 --> 01:53:34,315
- [Dee Dee] I'll see you...

2344
01:53:34,348 --> 01:53:36,283
- Yeah, I love you too!

2345
01:53:42,757 --> 01:53:43,924
(laughs)

2346
01:53:43,957 --> 01:53:44,793
I mean...

2347
01:53:47,227 --> 01:53:48,495
No, I love you.

2348
01:53:50,064 --> 01:53:52,399
I've known that since I met you.

2349
01:53:52,433 --> 01:53:56,203
I haven't cared for
anyone as much as you

2350
01:53:56,236 --> 01:54:01,241
and I don't feel the way I
feel for you for anyone else.

2351
01:54:02,109 --> 01:54:03,812
- Well, I feel the same way.

2352
01:54:14,455 --> 01:54:15,790
- You look nice!

2353
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:21,663
(laughs)

2354
01:54:21,696 --> 01:54:24,298
She said she loves me.

2355
01:54:24,331 --> 01:54:26,668
I mean, she didn't say
it outright like I did,

2356
01:54:26,701 --> 01:54:28,969
but she inferred it, right?

2357
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:32,973
Like, like you would
say she inferred it?

2358
01:54:33,006 --> 01:54:34,809
- Yeah, I'd say so, yeah.

2359
01:54:34,843 --> 01:54:36,511
- And I mean, I don't know,

2360
01:54:36,544 --> 01:54:39,279
I just feel like all my
dreams, all my hard work,

2361
01:54:39,313 --> 01:54:44,084
they're coming together and
it's all because of you, Jesus.

2362
01:54:44,118 --> 01:54:45,018
- Yeah.

2363
01:54:45,052 --> 01:54:47,622
Yeah, I'm pretty inspirational.

2364
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:50,625
- Here I am, going on
and on about my successes

2365
01:54:50,658 --> 01:54:52,459
and, you know, girls
telling me they love me

2366
01:54:52,493 --> 01:54:54,662
or inferring it and I feel bad.

2367
01:54:54,696 --> 01:54:58,600
I feel like I haven't been
putting enough time and effort

2368
01:54:58,633 --> 01:55:03,203
or energy into figuring
out your purpose, you know?

2369
01:55:03,237 --> 01:55:04,071
You know?

2370
01:55:06,407 --> 01:55:07,842
Jesus!

2371
01:55:07,876 --> 01:55:09,109
I know.

2372
01:55:09,143 --> 01:55:10,612
- I get that a lot.
- I get that a lot.

2373
01:55:10,645 --> 01:55:12,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you
can't be looking like that,

2374
01:55:12,112 --> 01:55:15,282
going out there with
all those people.

2375
01:55:17,317 --> 01:55:19,788
But you're not going
out there, are you?

2376
01:55:19,821 --> 01:55:21,922
- No, no, I'm sorry, Laz.

2377
01:55:23,157 --> 01:55:24,458
It's time for me to go.

2378
01:55:24,491 --> 01:55:26,226
I have a lot of things to do,

2379
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:29,631
I have to get ready for
Christmas and then Easter.

2380
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:32,700
And, uh, I don't
get any time off.

2381
01:55:32,734 --> 01:55:34,935
You know, that glutton Santa,
he gets most of the year off,

2382
01:55:34,968 --> 01:55:35,904
but not me.

2383
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:38,573
You know, after
Christmas, it's Easter

2384
01:55:38,606 --> 01:55:41,308
and I got to help the giant
bunny hide a bunch of eggs.

2385
01:55:41,341 --> 01:55:42,610
It's a whole ordeal.

2386
01:55:42,644 --> 01:55:43,977
- Do you really?

2387
01:55:45,045 --> 01:55:46,380
- No!

2388
01:55:46,413 --> 01:55:47,816
No, Laz, I don't.

2389
01:55:49,383 --> 01:55:52,453
- But I thought your
purpose was supposed to,

2390
01:55:52,486 --> 01:55:53,987
you know, we were
supposed to find out

2391
01:55:54,021 --> 01:55:56,758
what you're supposed
to be doing down here.

2392
01:55:56,791 --> 01:55:58,258
- It was you, Laz.

2393
01:55:58,292 --> 01:56:00,461
You were the mission.

2394
01:56:00,494 --> 01:56:02,996
- I'm just some computer geek.

2395
01:56:04,498 --> 01:56:08,736
- Yeah, yeah, you are, but
you're also so much more.

2396
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:11,004
My mission was your mission.

2397
01:56:11,038 --> 01:56:13,608
Look at everything you
did here for this church

2398
01:56:13,641 --> 01:56:15,976
and churches everywhere.

2399
01:56:16,009 --> 01:56:18,513
You got people to
believe in me again.

2400
01:56:18,546 --> 01:56:22,750
You made people believe
in me, and God, and faith,

2401
01:56:22,784 --> 01:56:25,720
and everything it
means and stands for.

2402
01:56:25,753 --> 01:56:27,321
- I did that?

2403
01:56:27,354 --> 01:56:28,756
- Yeah!

2404
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:31,158
And there's much more to come.

2405
01:56:31,191 --> 01:56:34,662
- Won't I need you
there for that too?

2406
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:37,197
- Um, maybe not as close.

2407
01:56:37,231 --> 01:56:38,766
But I'll always be there.

2408
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,434
By your side.

2409
01:56:40,467 --> 01:56:42,570
Just like I am for everybody.

2410
01:56:42,604 --> 01:56:44,672
Whispering encouragement.

2411
01:56:44,706 --> 01:56:46,373
Up until now, you
hadn't been listening.

2412
01:56:46,406 --> 01:56:48,041
(laughs)

2413
01:56:48,075 --> 01:56:51,478
You know, that's how
it goes sometimes.

2414
01:56:51,513 --> 01:56:52,947
Now it's your turn.

2415
01:56:52,981 --> 01:56:56,383
To encourage people,
rally believers,

2416
01:56:56,416 --> 01:56:58,185
and keep faith alive.

2417
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:02,624
- I'll try my best.

2418
01:57:03,892 --> 01:57:05,425
- We know you will.

2419
01:57:08,395 --> 01:57:10,097
Well, you better get out there.

2420
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:12,466
