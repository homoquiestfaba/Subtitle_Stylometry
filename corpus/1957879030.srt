"In my hometown,
I never felt at home.

was first writing about him,

16
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,009
not knowing
that I felt the same.

17
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,245
As time went on,
I would learn

18
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,814
that this was not
the only thing
we had in common.

Good morning, everyone,
this is Dan Lomax

with another P.A.L. show.

21
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,360
What are you doing today?

-Dad...
-Joe?

23
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,898
-Uh, pardon?
-What are you doing today?

24
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,300
Oh, well, I'll be
in the office.

25
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,503
I'm--I'm finishing up
that, uh, story I was writing,

26
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,572
-the story about that fellow.
-The same one?

27
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,407
No, a different one--
Which one do you mean, hon?

28
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,409
-I don't know.
-[Nora] The one you
were working on.

29
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,077
He works on
a lot of them, Nora.

30

-Yes, so whi--
-I know, Mama.
I was just asking.

31
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,714
The Fish Man?

32
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,082
Ah, yes, the Fish Man?

33
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,151
Oh, Mr. Flood?
No, not old Mr. Flood.

34
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,953
No, I-I finished
with Mr. Flood.

35
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,521
[chuckles]
I finished with him.

36
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,855
I liked him.

37
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,824
He wasn't real though,
Elizabeth.

38
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,892
I know.

39
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,128
I mean, I just liked
his story, him.

40
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,197
Well, thank you very much.
I liked him, too.

41
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,099
But, no, you're right,
Nora, he was not real.

42
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,603
He was all--all different
people kinda all balled up
into one. You know?

43
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,071
Did those people know?

44
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,138
[Mitchell] What?

45
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,608
That they were made
into someone else?

46
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,910
Uh... no,
I don't think so.

47
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,612
So what is this story
you're doing?

48
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,980
Well, this story's about...

49
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,284
a fella who has a bar.
Well, i-it's about the bar.

50
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,219
-A bar?
-A bar?

51
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,121
Yes, a bar.

52
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,258
An old bar,
the oldest bar
in New York City.

53
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,792
Sounds boring.

54
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,894
Well...

55
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,397
I don't mean boring,
I just mean,

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,531
a bar?

57
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,966
Oh, my goodness.
Girls, we're late.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,401
Come on.
Get your things
quickly, quickly.

00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,836
All right, let's go.
What time is it?

60
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,204
Joe, do you not
have your watch on?

61
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,472
No, I have it.
I have it.

62
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,706
-Okay, that's enough.
-All right, let's go.

get your hat.

65
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,277
Please.

00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,380
-Therese.
-Hmm?

67
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,616
Do you think
it's boring?

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,184
Well, I don't know.
I haven't read it.

69
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,386
It could be boring.

70
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,420
It depends
on what happens.

71
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,056
Well, you know,
nothing happens.

72
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,892
Well, then it all
depends on the writer,
doesn't it, my dear?

00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,462
-[Nora] Come on!
-All right, all right.
Let's go.

her bag? Good girl.

Pardon?

only, "Morning,"
without the "good."

could have more.

[Elizabeth] What?

177
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,242
[Mitchell and Therese]
It's watermelon!

178
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,810
Oh, good!

179
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,780
Come on.
There we go.

180
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,348
-Thank you.
-Hold on. Hold on.

181
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,216
I pick...

182
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,019
- There we go.
- I pick... this one.

183
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,220
-Oh!
-Okay.

184
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,656
My daddy always said
this was the only thing

185
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,958
a newspaper was good for.

186
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,260
And what did you say?

187
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,729
Me? I said not a thing.

188
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,566
-Mmm.
-That's good.

189
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,767
Mmm!

190
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,911
Oh, no. Oh, no. I won't do that.
I'll give you a dance.

191
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,317
Now, I can do a seagull,
a seagull.

192
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,820
[squawks]

193
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,028
Thank you. Thank you.

194
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,698
-[Mitchell] Harry?
-Yes?

195
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,101
-Let me ask you a question.
-[Harry] Mm-hmm?

196
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,136
You know what fella
who was in here the other day?

197
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,204
Who?

198
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,241
The small,
disheveled looking--

199
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,777
-That was you, Joe.
-Oh, hush.

200
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,445
No, you know who
I'm talking about--

201
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,713
Gould.
I know who you mean.

202
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,215
Joe Gould, the writer.

203
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,516
"The writer"?

204
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,418
Yep, written
the History of the World.

205
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,755
Now don't say I never
gave you anything.

206
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,590
What do you mean,
"the History of the World"?

207
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,291
[stammers]

208
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,060
I'm tellin ya--

209
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,196
Not like a history book,
like, history.

210
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,566
But more like what people
say to each other
on the street,

211
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,236
wherever, every day
in their lives, you know?

212
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,873
In a-an oral history,
he says he calls it.

213
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,441
Help me out, Jimmy.

214
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,177
You know, oral.
From the mouth.

215
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,279
Go talk to Max Gordon
at the Village Vanguard and...

216
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,982
Oh, okay.

217
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,784
All right.

218
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,786
[Mitchell] So you say
Mr. Gould comes in here

219
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,087
and leaves these notebooks?

220
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,655
-Hundreds of notebooks.
-Uh-huh.

221
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,457
Dozens, Max. Dozens.

222
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,958
All right, dozens
of these notebooks.

223
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,960
They're composition
books, like, you know,
from school.

224
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,029
Yeah, he drops them off
for safekeeping.

225
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,264
He doesn't have a home,
you know.

226
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,665
No, I know, I know.

227
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,433
He leaves them here,
and then he leaves.

228
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,768
-We give him some money.
-Yeah.

229
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
Always,
for the Joe Gould Fund.

230
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,238
-That's what he calls it.
-Really?

231
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,873
I feel badly for him.

232
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,275
Sadie, it's a choice.

233
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,076
Who makes a choice
like that?

234
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,546
He did. He does.
What are you gonna do?

235
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,881
People live their lives
the way they wanna
live their lives.

236
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,650
-True, true.
-Give them some money,

237
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,718
-food, you know,
a lot of us do.
-Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,420
Aaron Siskind. Cummings.

239
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,255
-E.E. Cummings?
-Yeah.

240
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,957
-Alice, Alice Neel.
-Alice.

241
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,193
Yeah, we all do.
He's a smart man, Gould.

242
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,894
-He's very smart.
-He's just...

243
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,697
Who knows?

244
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,702
[Mitchell]
So, Miss Neel, when did you
paint this portrait of him?

245
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,571
This was, uh...

246
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,307
let us say,

247
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,242
17 years ago.

248
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,310
Uh...

249
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,112
yeah.
When we were all-- Hmm.

250
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,081
[record playing
song in French]

251
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,058
Wow.

252
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,860
That's very nice.

253
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,231
[Alice] Hmm.

254
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,938
I gave him
three penises.

255
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,574
Yes, I see that.

256
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,576
Didn't really seem
to be enough.

257
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,411
-Really?
-Well, because

258
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,013
I think Joe's
an exhibitionist.

259
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,214
I mean, not technically,
but...

260
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,649
Uh-huh.

261
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,784
When I'd be watching him
at parties, you know, way back,

262
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,254
uh, I'd think...

263
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,190
he's a little old
exhibitionist

264
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,359
shut off in there
somewhere.

265
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,160
He really likes this--

266
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,595
this portrait a lot.

267
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,265
Well, I don't blame him.

268
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,401
-It's a very...
-Yeah.

269
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,176
Well, at least
I'll never be accused
of being a romantic.

270
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,412
Oh, no, no, no.
There's no fear of that.

271
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,117
I like it very much.
I really do.

272
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,588
[Mitchell]
I'm looking for a fella
by the name of Joe Gould.

273
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,290
[laughs]

274
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,891
Professor Seagull, huh?

275
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,660
-Gould?
-Yeah, Gould.

276
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,261
-Joe Gould, right?
-Joe Gould, yes.
That's right.

277
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,963
Yeah, he--
he speaks seagull,
you know,

278
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,499
or understands it
or both or something.

279
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,067
-Really?
-Yeah.

280
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,470
-Well, Max Gordon, you know,
uh, Max Gordon fella.
-Vanguard.

281
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,941
Vanguard, yeah.
Uh, he told me that
I might find him here.

282
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,276
Oh, yeah.
He's right behind you.

283
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,611
That's him.

284
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,247
He comes in here
all the time.
We give him food.

285
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,848
He sits. He writes.

286
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,317
-It's good for business.
-Uh-huh.

287
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,919
The tourists see
a real bohemian,
they go, "Ooh."

288
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,454
[both chuckle]

289
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,956
Comes in about 7:00.

290
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,259
[Mitchell]
I see. Thank you.

291
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,895
Hello.

292
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,596
Yes, uh, this is
Joe Mitchell.

293
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,665
I won't be able to make it
back to the office
this afternoon.

294
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,967
Are there
any messages for me?

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,668
[Sarah] Mr. Mitchell,
it's Sarah.

296
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,172
There's a gentleman
here who wishes
to speak with you.

297
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,574
I don't have
an appointment
for anyone.

298
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,676
He's very insistent.
He hasn't given me
his name.

299
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,245
-I don't know how you'd like
for me to handle this--
-Give me the phone!

300
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,680
Excuse me!

301
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,016
Hello! This is Joe Gould,
author of the Oral History.

302
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,785
Oh, yes.
H-hello, Mr. Gould. Uh--

303
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,054
[Gould] The thing is, I was
supposed to attend a clinic.

304
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,589
The eye and ear infirmary
for the--

305
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,091
I can pick a prescription
for a little...

306
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,027
Uh, excuse me, madam!
I'm talking to your boss.

307
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,196
Uh, a little eye infection
I've been having.

308
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,598
Uh, and it's gonna
cost me around $2.00.

309
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,734
And I just discovered
that I don't have
any money on me.

310
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,336
Uh, it's getting late
and I just wondered
if your--

311
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,538
-your lady here,
your secretary could--
-Sir! Sir!

312
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,443
Excuse me. I haven't
finished talking
to Mr. Mitchell!

313
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,346
If your receptionist here,

314
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,550
could lend me $2.00,
and we could meet
anytime you say

315
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,619
and I'll pay you back.
How about the...

316
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,488
[coughs]

317
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,223
The Jefferson Coffee Shop!

318
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,191
9:30!

319
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,060
[grunts]

320
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,295
Hello? Hello?

321
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,703
He's a terribly dirty
little man,

322
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,072
terribly nosy.

323
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,074
I was glad to get him
out of here.

324
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,110
Well, Sarah,
I am terribly sorry
for your inconvenience.

325
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,379
Oh, it's just, you know.

326
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,583
For one thing, he wanted
to know how much I make.

327
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,152
-He did?
-Oh!

328
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,187
He said he'd
also thought about it,

329
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,723
and that 9:30
in the morning was
a little early for him.

330
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,493
Suggested you meet him
at a more civilized hour,

331
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,095
such as 11:00.

332
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,665
11 a.m.? Okay.
Well, that's okay.
I could do that.

333
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,001
He also told me that...

334
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,405
I have
beautiful shoulders.

335
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,408
Well, he's right.

336
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,345
-[both laugh]
-Stop!

337
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,948
Good night, Sarah.

338
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,317
And thanks again.

339
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,656
So I suppose you're puzzled
about me, Mr. Mitchell.

340
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,359
If so, the feeling's mutual.

341
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,429
I'm puzzled about me,
and have been
since childhood.

342
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,131
[chuckles]

343
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,601
Did you ever have
a painful operation
or disease?

344
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,737
Uh, I beg your pardon?

345
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,040
Say, "I may marry Mary."

346
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:06,945
Um, "I may marry Mary."

347
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,048
How did your father feel
when you didn't want to go
into the tobacco business?

348
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,819
Well, um...

349
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,990
-Tell you the truth,
he was disappointed.
-Ah.

350
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,461
How did you know
I was from Fairmont?

351
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,197
Well, at first,
I thought Kentucky...

352
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,166
then Tennessee.

353
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,168
But your As
are too broad...

354
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,404
so North Carolina.

355
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,706
-Tidal North Carolina.
-That's very good.

356
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,608
-[chuckles]
-No, no, it's okay.

357
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,411
Because my father
was very disappointed
in me, too.

358
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,947
[rubs hands]

359
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,049
So you want to know
about the oral history.

360
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,951
Yes, I do.

361
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,687
Yes, uh, first things first,
Mr. Mitchell. First things.

362
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,525
Uh, my full name
is Joseph Ferdinand Gould.

363
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,528
My father,
Clarke Storer Gould,
was a doctor,

364
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,730
as was his father
before him, as was,
as was...

365
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,500
And the Goulds
have been the Goulds

366
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,469
since the Cabots
and the Lowells
were clam-diggers.

367
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,507
Uh, should've been born
in Boston, but was born
and raised in Norwood,

368
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,942
which is a fairly
good-sized Yankee town

369
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,710
about 15 miles
southwest of the city.

370
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,513
Went to Harvard.

371
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,049
-Ah.
-Graduated class 1911.

372
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:21,453
Then after Harvard,
I-I did a variety
of unsuitable things.

373
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,889
I studied eugenics, which
I put to use by measuring

374
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,524
the heads of a thousand
Chippewa Indians.

375
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,992
Let's face it. The only
civilized people left.

376
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,228
Before finally arriving
in New York

377
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,829
where I became
a half messenger boy,

378
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,764
uh, half police reporter
on the Evening Mail.

379
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,234
Evening Mail, yeah, sure.
I know the Evening Mail.

380
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,002
[Gould] Now this
is very important.

381
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,670
One day,

382
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,539
while I was reading
during the lunch hour,

383
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,741
I saw a quote

384
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,843
which changed the course
of my life forever.

385
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,879
No, I'll--I'll tell it
to you at a later time.

386
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,249
-All right.
-Then all of a sudden,

387
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,351
the idea for
the Oral History
occurred to me.

388
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,219
I would spend my life
in the city...

389
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,955
listening to people

390
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,824
and writing down
whatever I heard them say,

391
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,059
no matter how boring
or dull or idiotic or...

392
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,628
Where the hell
is our lunch?!

393
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,866
Goddamn Greek
son of a bitch.

394
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,008
You know how long
the Oral History is now,
Mr. Mitchell?

395
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,809
No, I don't.
Um, but, um...

396
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,344
[Gould] One million...

397
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,013
two-hundred thousand
words long.

398
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,116
That's three times longer
than the Holy Bible.

399
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,251
That's very impressive.

400
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,986
I think so. I think so.

401
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,855
I mean, not even given--

402
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,590
[Mitchell]
Uh, no, no, I know. Thanks.

403
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,158
Thank you.

404
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,835
[waitress]
You oughta have
more self-respect

405
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,270
than to do
a thing like that.

406
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,706
When I'm hungry,
I don't have any
self-respect.

407
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,508
Besides...

408
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,277
I-I'm not just
an ordinary person!

409
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,548
I am Joe Gould!

410
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,617
I'm Joe Gould the poet!
I'm Joe Gould the historian!

411
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,053
I'm Joe Gould the wild
Chippewa Indian dancer!

412
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,822
I do you an honor merely
coming into this place!

413
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,325
And what do you do
in return

414
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,026
but bother me about
such things as ketchup!

415
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,201
[chuckles]

416
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,904
There is a small word
for a big woman like that

417
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,939
but I'll not use it until
we're better acquainted.

418
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,908
Let's eat.

419
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,944
-[grunts]
-Oh, so, what did you--

420
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,546
-Oh. Ah.
-I got--

421
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,049
Yeah, it's an excerpt from
Ezra Pound's old magazine.

422
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,984
-August, 1927.
-Oh, The Exile.
Oh, yes. I know this.

423
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,753
-There's a chapter from
the Oral History in there.
-Certainly.

424
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,422
And, uh, I've got
E.E. Cummings
to thank for that.

425
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,257
Oh, you know E.E.?

426
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,859
He knows
me-hee-hee.

427
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,227
[both chuckle]

428
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,929
-Yeah, he wrote a poem about me.
-Oh, really?

429
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,465
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now here's--
What the fuck?

430
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,266
Oh, cigarette butts.

431
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,768
No, no, that's okay.

432
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,670
It's useful
to have a sack when
the weather's wet.

433
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,840
-Sure.
-Now we got-- [coughs]

434
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,775
Yeah, we've got a copy
of Broom here.

435
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,677
Oh, good, all right.
Yes, I know Broom.

436
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,679
Now, that has snippets
of the Oral History
in there.

437
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,847
Yeah. Good.

438
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,483
-All right. Wonderful.
-Yeah.

439
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,351
-One more snippet-- Whoa!
-And, uh...

440
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,186
Whoa-ho-ho!

441
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,123
-I have it. I have it.
-You got it? Thank you,
sir. Thank you so much.

442
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,024
Now we've got Pagany.
Pagany.

443
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,526
Now there's some
snippets in there.

444
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,027
Oh, yes. I know Pagany.

445
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,797
-There's a quote,
a copy of a quote.
- This one?

446
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,465
-Ezra--
-That's right,

447
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,300
that Ezra Pound wrote
about me and William
Carlos Williams.

448
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,301
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

449
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,103
Oh, well, all right.

450
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,304
-Well...
-I hope it doesn't rain.

451
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,572
No, I hope not.

452
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,307
-Well, that's good.
-Anyway, so yes,

453
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,443
-this is good for now.
This is good for now.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,478
Perfect.
So, uh, Mr. Gould,

455
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,880
when-- when should
we meet again?

456
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,381
Ah. Saturday?

457
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,183
-Saturday?
-Yeah. At Goody's.

458
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,584
-That's a bar.
-Yes, I know.

459
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,919
On-- on Sixth and Ninth.

460
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,554
-Yes, I know.
-Between Ninth and Tenth.

461
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,689
-Yes, I know.
-You know all the best bars,
don't you, Mr. Mitchell?

462
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,426
-[chuckles] Well...
-I think we're going
to get along quite well.

463
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,561
[laughs]

464
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,863
-[Gould] Bye!
-Bye-bye!

465
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,178
[Mitchell]
"I have not read
anything else by Joe Gould.

466
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,146
And yet, by this alone,

467
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,515
he is one of the great
and genuine

468
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,418
and original American writers.

469
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,954
'I'll put down
the informal history

470
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,889
of the shirt-sleeved multitude,

471
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,425
what they had to say
about their jobs,

472
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,829
love affairs,
victuals, sprees,

473
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,665
scrapes, and sorrows.

474
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:31,002
The Oral History is a great
hodgepodge and kitchen midden

475
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,005
of hearsay,
a repository of jabber,

476
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,008
an omnium-gatherum
of bushwa...

477
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,978
gab, palaver, hogwash,

478
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,713
flapdoodle, and malarkey,

479
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,350
the fruit of more than
20,000 conversations.

480
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,653
What people say is history,'
Gould says,

481
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,589
'what we used to think
was history,

482
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,092
is only formal history
and largely false.

483
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,295
I'll put down
the informal history,

484
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,232
or I'll perish
in the attempt.'"

485
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,436
[Mitchell]
Maybe he was afraid.

486
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,837
Maybe.

487
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,540
I mean, did you
sneak up on him?

488
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,641
Joe!

489
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,876
No, well, I'm just saying,

490
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,210
I mean, it could've
felt like that to him.

491
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,578
I was
practically invisible.

492
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,647
No, honey, you're
too attractive
to be invisible.

493
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,382
-Oh, well, thank you very much.
-That's okay.

494
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,518
No, he jumped up
and berated me.

495
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,553
"How dare you?!
I don't know you!"

496
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,154
I was terribly
embarrassed.

497
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,191
Well, some people feel
it steals your soul.

498
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,927
Now, why would I
want his soul?

499
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,329
Where would I put it?

500
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,236
You're a pretty funny
young lady, aren't you?

501
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,606
Sometimes.

502
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,875
[Gould]
Is she your type?

503
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,310
[Mitchell]
Parts of her.

504
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,715
I like her entirety.

505
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,718
I love her, in fact.

506
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,189
But... I know her,
of course.

507
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,592
-How do you mean?
-Oh, I don't mean
in the biblical sense.

508
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,395
Although, I swear
it got very close one time

509
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,397
between me and her
on one rainy afternoon.

510
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,866
There was a tension aroused
so palpable, you could've...

511
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,601
tripped on it.

512
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,103
No, no.
I meant that, uh...

513
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,773
I know her, because...

514
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,009
Gaston Lachaise,
the sculptor...

515
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,746
is a friend and
supporter of mine.

516
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,715
[Mitchell]
Oh, really?

517
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,652
You don't believe me?

518
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,388
No, that's not--
Uh, yes, I mean, that's
not what I meant by it.

519
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,856
Well, what did
"really" mean?

520
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,325
No, it just meant,
"really."

521
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,160
An expression of shock.

522
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,263
No, not at all, Mr. Gould.
It was an expression that...

523
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,698
I was impressed.

524
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,134
Really?

525
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,537
Yes.

526
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,908
So anyway, you're saying
that this fella Lachaise...

527
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,876
Yes, Lachaise.
Lachaise.

528
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,245
-Is a supporter of yours?
-He is a supporter of mine.

529
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,315
and he took up cudgels
on my behalf in a soiree
one evening,

530
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,553
when Edward Nagle
called me a barbarian.

531
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:05,357
Because I didn't see
a picture as a picture,
it didn't mean anything to me.

532
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,292
All I saw was
the expression of the man
who had painted it.

533
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,893
And Gaston Lachaise
agreed with me,

534
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,096
saying that art is
essentially a means
of self-expression,

535
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,999
putting E. Nagle
in his place.

536
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,300
[both chuckle]

537
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,635
Well, that must have
made you feel good.

538
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,269
No, actually it
made me feel bad.

539
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,639
Because although
our thoughts were the same,

540
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,374
Gaston's and mine,
his meant something

541
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,975
because he was
who he was.

542
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,443
Mine meant nothing,

543
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,512
because I was who I am.

544
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,049
I see.

545
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,553
You know, Mr. Gould,

546
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,389
if you publish
the Oral History,

547
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,392
you might become
someone who people know.

548
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,828
Oh, is that
what it's all about?

549
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,564
Well, no, no, I'm
just saying that,

550
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,899
if you wanted that.

551
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,734
I'm not saying that
that's what it's ab--

552
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,935
That's-- that's my hat.

553
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,341
-Um...
-Mr. Mitchell,

554
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,077
I have lugged
the Oral History

555
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,713
into 14 different
publishing offices,

556
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,548
and none would have it.

557
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,016
So you have done that?

558
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,851
Well, yes, I have done that,
and none of them
would have it.

559
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,888
Mr. Gould,
when might I see some
of the Oral History?

560
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,423
Why, I...

561
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,159
thought you'd never ask,
Mr. Mitchell.

562
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,697
Vivian! We're going!

563
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,766
Okay. Bye-bye.

564
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,202
-It was so nice to meet you.
-It was nice to meet you, too.

565
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,438
-[mumbles]
-Oh, yes.

566
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,475
She's just, uh...

567
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,279
Thanks. Thanks.
That'll come in handy.

568
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,181
-Great show. Congrats.
-Oh, thank you.

569
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,483
Bye-bye, Joe and Joe.
[chuckles]

570
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,620
[Gould] I keep chapters
of the Oral History

571
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,956
stored with friends and
colleagues around town.

572
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:48,660
These are mostly artists
who understand the importance

573
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,963
of what I'm doing and who are
also regular contributors

574
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,531
to the Joe Gould Fund.

575
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,004
Helen? Helen,
it's Joe Gould.

576
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,340
I need to pick up
a few volumes
of the O.H.

577
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,543
-Sweetheart.
-[Helen] Oh, hi, Joe.

578
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,513
-I need to pick up
a few volumes of the O.H.
-Oh, sure.

579
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,849
I have need of them now.
At least...

580
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,517
Mr. Mitchell,
my biographer, does.

581
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,885
-[Helen] Who?
-Mr. Mitchell!

582
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,588
My biographer.

583
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,157
He's with me now.
He writes for
The New Yorker.

584
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,825
[clatter]

585
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,996
-[clatter, cat meowing]
-[Helen] Oh! Here.

586
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,432
Here.

587
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,666
-Those are--
-Two, right?

588
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,768
Yes, yes, yes.

589
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,103
Yes, these are the ones.
Uh, Joe Mitchell.

590
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,339
-Uh, Helen Maris.
-How do you do? Pleasure.

591
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,142
Um, do you have--
[clears throat]

592
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,444
Would you have
a little contribution
to the Joe Gould Fund?

593
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:44,182
[hums a tune]

594
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,152
Yes! This will
come in handy.

595
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,720
Did you think
I forgot, Joe?

596
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,421
Well, I know you have
a lot on your mind, so...

597
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,357
-[chuckles]
-Good luck, Mr. Mitchell.

598
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,691
Thank you very much.

599
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,760
She's a good egg, but
she's a little... ehh...

600
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,359
[Mitchell]
N-no, you can trust me.

601
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,661
[Gould] I hope so.

602
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,696
'Cause should they fall
into the wrong hands,

603
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,364
my plans for them
will be destroyed.

604
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,967
-[Mitchell] Your plan?
-[Gould] Yes, my will, my will.

605
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,535
Two thirds
of the Oral History

606
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,504
I bequeath
to Harvard alma mater

607
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,172
and the other third
to the Smithsonian.

608
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,273
Unless I publish it
first, of course.

609
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,608
Oh, of course, Mr. Gould.

610
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,043
-Joe.
-Yes?

611
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,177
No, call me Joe now.

612
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,679
Oh, oh.
All right, all right.

613
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,180
-Joe.
-That's good. That's good.

614
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,648
Now where the fuck
are we?

615
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,984
Uh, I don't know,
Well, tell me where
we're headed

616
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,252
'cause I need to catch
a train uptown...

617
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,521
I know, I know. Aha!

618
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,922
Raah!

619
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,125
Well, hold--
Where are we headed?

620
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,295
-Hold on!
-[Gould yells]

621
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,631
Sons of bitches!
I knew it was tonight.

622
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,700
They tried to tell me
it wasn't happening,
the fuckers.

623
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,802
They're afraid.
Let's go.

624
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,570
Well, Joe, no,
I really should be moving on.

625
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,505
-Come on, come on!
-All right, all right,
all right.

626
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,341
-Follow me.
-All right.

627
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,180
"Let none of this
come to pass.

628
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,782
Let the woodcutter
awaken...

629
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,686
Let Abraham come
with his axe..."

630
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,121
Oh, Freddie!

631
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,390
Do you know
Mr. Joseph Mitchell,
the writer?

632
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,892
-Shh!
-I'm introducing him!

633
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,693
-This is Mr. Mitchell.
-How do you do?

634
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,263
Welcome.
Francis Lambert McCrudden.

635
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,299
-You're here with--
-Yes! He's here with the rummy!

636
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,501
-He's my biographer.
-Oh, is that so?

637
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,436
It is so.
It is--
Tell him, Joe.

638
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,305
[whispering]
Yes, it is true.

639
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,607
I am--
I am going to write
a little something,

640
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,542
-uh, about Mr. Gould.
-[woman shushes]

641
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,944
If I can-- Yes,
I'm terribly sorry.

642
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:56,881
Mr. Gould,
though not a member,
comes quite often.

643
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,417
But I don't think
it's for the poetry

644
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,386
as much as for
the food and wine.

645
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,422
Mr. Gould is not serious
about poetry.

646
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,524
Oh, is that why you won't
let me join The Raven?

647
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,927
'Cause I'm not
serious enough
for you, Frank?

648
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,195
-Shh!
-Most of your members
are not serious.

649
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,464
They write about
such trite themes as...

650
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,300
life, love, and death.

651
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,002
-Thank you!
-Yeah!

652
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,005
-[Gould yells]
-Thank you, thank you!

653
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,844
-[Gould continues yelling]
-Thank you, thank you!

654
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,846
-Mr. Gould!
-I have a poem!

655
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,548
-Yes, I'm sure you do.
-[grunting] Yeah!
I have a poem.

656
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,550
But we have some business
to attend to.

657
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,486
I have a poem
about religion,
short and sweet, like me.

658
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,056
"My Religion,"
by Joseph Ferdinand Gould.

659
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,425
"In the winter,
I'm a Buddhist,

660
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,662
In the summer,
I'm a nudist!"

661
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,999
-[crowd groans]
-Please!

662
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,702
Oh! Don't touch me!
Thank you!

663
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:51,669
Excuse me, sir.

664
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,306
Fuckers!

665
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,655
Take care of those
composition books, Joe.

666
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,892
The Oral History
is my rope, my scaffold.

667
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,030
My bed, my board,
my wife, my floozy.

668
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,166
My wound
and the salt on it.

669
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,535
My whiskey,
my aspirin.

670
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,404
My rock
and my salvation.

671
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,041
It's the only thing
that matters a damn to me.

672
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,977
All else is dross.

673
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,696
[Gould] Civilization
brings distinctions of caste

674
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,931
apart from
individual attainment.

675
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,869
Thus is developed
the patrician and the peasant.

676
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,971
Each has a different set
of virtues,

677
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,775
and both are needed for
the complete sum of humanity.

678
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,511
When you find a patrician
without pride

679
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,413
or a peasant without avarice,

680
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,416
you get very nearly
the perfect person.

681
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,285
In the eyes
of the infinite...

682
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,557
all pride is
just dust and ashes.

683
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,466
Ooh-hoo! Ah!

684
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,840
Oh, gorgeous!

685
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,710
Come on in, sweetheart,
and you drink till you drop.

686
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,682
-Ooh!
-Can I, uh--

687
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,918
Cummings said
there was a soiree.

688
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,853
-Of course, Joe. Come in.
-Can I come in?

689
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,655
-Do you mind if I come in?
-Oh, yes, yes.

690
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,857
-Is he here?
-No, not yet. How have you been?

691
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,460
Oh, good, good.
Spending time
with my biographer.

692

-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

-Hi.
-Charmed.

695
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,333
You've got to meet
David and Janet, darling.
They're reporters.

696
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,202
David, Janet,
this is Joseph Gould.

697
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,204
Joe's a writer. He used
to write for The Times.

698
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,139
-Oh, right.
-Darling, excuse me a moment.

699
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,841
-Good to see you, Joe.
-Yeah!

700
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,943
-So you write?
-No, I don't.

701
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,711
-Oh, I thought she said--
-No, no, no.

702
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,280
I don't read
The Times, either.

703
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,583
However, I do use it
to keep my crotch warm

704
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,251
on these frigid
New York nights.

Hello, Freddie,
you old goat.

709
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,206
Margaret, you have
just been kissed
by Joe Gould.

710
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,142
I'm just gonna
go on kissing.

711
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,577
Hello, Joe Gould.

712
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,280

Joseph Ferdinand Gould.

Historian, aesthete...

717
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,359
And though a direct
descendant of William
the Conqueror,

718
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,761
I've always wanted
to think of myself

719
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,197
as belonging
to the masses,
not the classes.

720
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,899
A certain lady
once said to me,

721
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,567
"Mr. Gould, you know,
there are two types
of gentlemen.

722
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,068
One is a gentleman
by the grace of God,

723
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,403
and the other
is a gentleman

724
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,105
because of
inherited culture.

725
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,339
You belong
to both types.

726
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,708
Well,
how right she was.

00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,310

a one-man show, say, "Aye!"

Good night.

808
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:12,336
[Gould] Modern life brings
a conflict not found elsewhere.

809
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,673
Every human being
has two primary impulses.

810
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,408
One is to build a home.

811
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,478
The other is
for self-development.

812
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,714
Being responsible
for other lives is a handicap

813
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,684
towards pursuing
one's own ambition.

814
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,053
The problem with marriage then

815
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,589
is essentially how to give
this worthy individual

816
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,057
the right to parenthood

817
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,426

to best express

818
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,194
the best that is in him.

819
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,698
I have never been able
to adapt myself
to civilization.

820
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,568
It's--It's too needlessly
complex and materialistic,

821
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,972
and my father's death
focused my attention
to this point.

822
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:52,476
It is in the presence
of death that the collapse
of civilization is seen.

823
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,845
We would do better
to stick to simple ritual

824
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,647

of savage life...

825
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,549

I did. I have.

Essay chapters
and oral chapters.

-I'll have a martini, please.
-And two martinis.

855
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,535
No, j-just the martini,
just the martini.

856
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,670
I don't care for beer.

857
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,305
So just the--

858
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,308
Look, I have something
to, uh, tell you.

859
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,647
Thank you.

860
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,951
Okay, uh...

861
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,221
The Oral History.

862
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,757
You know the Met?

863
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,558
The museum?

864
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,528
-Yes, the Metropolitan.
-Yes.

865
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,431
Well, they have taken
a great many of their
most precious paintings

866
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,502
and stored them
in a bombproof location
for the duration of the war.

867
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,337
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I had heard that.

868
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,939
-Really?
-Yes.

869
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,508
Mm.

870
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,243
Well, I...

871
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,246
I've thought about
the Oral History,

872
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,450
and it's precious.
Not just to me,
but to humanity.

873
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:47,985
Mm-hmm.

874
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,621
And I've decided
to protect it
in similar fashion.

875
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:52,723
All right.

876
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,895
And, Mr. Mitchell...

877
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,668
I have a friend.

878
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,140
The--
the Oral History...

879
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,577
is wrapped
in oilcloth

880
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,381
and stored
in a cellar...

881
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,383
[whispering]
on a duck and chicken
farm in Long Island.

882
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,685
Entre nous.

883
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,457
[Gould sings]

884
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,663
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

885
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,539
May I ask...

886
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,409
why a duck
and chicken farm?

887
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,780
Would you bomb
a duck and chicken farm?

888
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,217
No.

889
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,055
Would you look for
the history of the world
in a duck and chicken farm?

890
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:01,859
No.

891
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,227
Well...

892
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,566
Okay. Well, um...

893
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,468
all right. So...

894
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,574
Well, is there any way
then that, uh...

895
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,377
Yes.

896
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,980
I need $9.50.

897
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,183
$9.50. Um...

898
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,151
why?

899
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,589
Well, $5.00 for
a round-trip train fare
to Long Island,

900
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,793
2.50 for a round-trip
cab fare to and from
the farm,

901
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,728
and, uh...

902
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,164
$2.00 for
a box of chocolates
for my friend...

903
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,465
who owns the farm.

904
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,535
Okay.

905
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,670
When?

906
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,106
Two, three days
at the most.

907
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,108
All right.

908
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,278
Okay. [exhales]

909
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,117
Here's three--
Well, why don't I just
give you ten-- $10?

910
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,753
-Oh, Joe.
-And you can owe me 50 cents.

911
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,289
-We'll do that.
I me-mean, keep it.
-Are you sure?

912
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,391
-Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.
-Okay.

913
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,892
Keep the fifty cents.

914
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,594
-God bless.
-Sure.

915
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,896
[Mitchell]
It's a murder, you know?

916
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,698
I-it's like a murder.

917
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,768
-I know.
-You know?

918
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,436
-I know it is.
-I mean, i-it's--

919
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,539
it's inconceivable to me
that a building like this

920
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,908
would be knocked down.

921
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:28,278
It's-- it's--
it's 40 50 years old?

922
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,180
Well, it was in the way
of progress.

923
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,649
-It was in the way of what?
-It's in the way of the future.

924
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,518
-Oh, well, yeah,
I don't know about that.
-What is that?

925
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:35,953
-Look at that. Isn't that nice?
-Put that down.

926
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,087
-No, wait--
-Get your hand of there.

927
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,388
[man]
Excuse me, folks!

928
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,758
-[Mitchell] Yes?
-Uh, come out of there, please.

929
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,362
-Well, we're just--
-Would you come out
of there, please?

930
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,698
-[Mitchell] Okay, all right.
-What are you folks looking for?

931
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,800
-Well, nothing,
-Nothing, just--

932
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,602
Well, what are you
gonna do with that?

933
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,337
[Mitchell] I don't know.
Just... [chuckles]

934
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,705
take it home, I guess.

935
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,373
[officer] Oh, I'm sure
the city would love it

936
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,574
if you took
the whole pile home.

937
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,809
[both laugh]

938
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,944
Well, we don't
really have the room.

939
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,947
Just do me a favor.
Don't go poking around
where you don't belong.

940
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,649
Somebody might get hurt.

941
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,184
-[Mitchell] All right.
Yes, sir. Yes, officer.
-[Therese] Okay.

942
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,753
-Have a good day.
-[Mitchell] Yes,
thank you. You, too.

943
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,721
[Mitchell]
All right. Okay.

944
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,091
Is he gone?
He's gone. He's gone.

945
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,993
Okay, come on.
I saw some over here
I want to get.

946
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,527
Okay.

947
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,331
I ended up
begging this woman.
I begged her!

948
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,866
Now, now,
this is her niece?

949
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,967
Yes!

950
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,369
I said, "Look, I-I--

951
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,803
I've taken the trouble
to make all this trip

952
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,439
all this way,
this-- this long trip,

953
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,476
And-- and I
know you can't,
but you must try

954
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,378
to understand
the importance of this

955
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,612
and write to your aunt
in Florida.

956
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,347
"Write to her yourself,"
she said.

957
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,150
But why couldn't she
just give you the keys
to the cellar?

958
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:43,820
The key-- because
the keys are with
her aunt in Florida.

959
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:47,324
Couldn't she just call
her aunt in Florida and
have her send her the keys?

960
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,394
That's what I kept telling
this arrogant little b--

961
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,262
But all she said,
"Well, it's none
of my business"

962
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,830
in a not very nice tone

963
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,633
and I just left her
standing there at a loss
as to what to do.

964
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,568
All right. Right.

965
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,536
Here.

966
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,506
What's that?

967
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,374
Well, it's the chocolates
that I bought for my friend
who wasn't there.

968
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,343
-I wasn't about to give them
to the wretched niece.
-Oh, no, no--

969
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,911
Come on.
You paid for 'em.
They're yours.

970
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,112
-No, no.
-Yes!

971
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,847
I was gonna give 'em
back to the pharmacy,

972
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,916
Christopher's, where I
got 'em, so that I could
give you the money,

973
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,084
-but they wouldn't take it back.
-All right.

974
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,385
Even unopened.

975
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,621
Something about
food and safety,
new regulations.

976
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,489
[stammers]
They know me there.

977
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,525
I've been going there
for years!

978
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,460
They give me aspirin
from time to time
to help me

979
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,662
through a-- when I have
a truly awful hangover.

980
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,297
You know,
a katzenjammer,
I call it.

981
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,832
-Yes.
-Or, uh, you know,

982
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,534
they give me Brioschi
to help settle my stomach

983
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,536
-when I haven't had
a square one for a while.
-Yeah, I know.

984
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,272
They're really nice there.
[coughs]

985
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,507
The-- the father is--
Let me get a toothpick.

986
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,576
The father's Italian--
Yeah, that's right.

987
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,011
He was
from Italy originally,

988
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:44,181
but he anglicized
his last name to
circumvent the prejudice

989
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,116
which befalls
these immigrants.

990
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,517
Ah, you would
not believe.

991
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,154
And he--
he's been very generous
to a lot of bohemians.

992
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:52,556
Not-- not just me,
Joe, a lot--

993
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,624
Anyway, as I said,

994
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,627
they-- they would
not take back

995
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,596
or could not take back
these chocolates

996
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:03,133
or I...I would be giving
you the $2.00 it costs,
cash right now.

997
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,735
-I know, I know.
-I mean, believe me,

998
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,203
well, $2.70.

999
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,372
But I mean,
I paid the 70 cents
out of my own pocket.

1000
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,207
But that's okay.

1001
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,677
Or-- or I was
gonna use the money

1002
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,912
with your permission,
of course,

1003
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:19,449
to phone my friend
in Florida and--
and beg her

1004
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,685
to-- to, uh, mail me
the keys to the cellar

1005
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,254
but I mean,
I couldn't do that,
because I'm flat broke

1006
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,289
because of
the chocolate debacle.
See, I mean...

1007
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,557
-No, I know.
-And, uh--

1008
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,226
-So--
-So, I mean,

1009
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,195
I have the number
right here burning
a hole in my pocket.

1010
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,898
You have the number
of the woman in Florida?

1011
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,033
Mm-hmm. Yes.

1012
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,271
[coins jingling]

1013
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,115
Hello, operator.
I need a number
in Florida, please.

1014
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:56,520
Uh, Sarasota 76558.

1015
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,188
Uh, right.

1016
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,323
Money. Money.

1017
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,359
How much do you need?

1018
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,061
-Just give it to me. Just--
-All right.

1019
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,764
Okay, we got
one, two...

1020
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,666
three, four.

1021
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,038
They--
No, there's one left.

1022
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,040
There you go.

1023
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,877
Uh, thank you.
Thank you.

1024
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,214
Uh, operator, what part
of Montana are you from?

1025
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,684
Really? Really?

1026
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,653
Well-- [laughs]
Don't believe it.

1027
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,955
No, I just-- well, me?
Well, I'm just--

1028
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,557
I guess I'm a good listener,
that's all.

1029
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,393
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank--

1030
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,928
She's from
Chippewa Falls.

1031
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:40,730
That's right next
to the reservation
where I used to stay.

1032
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,933
-Did I ever--
-Yes, yes, you told me--

1033
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,035
Shh. Hello? Hello?!

1034
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,736
Yes. [clears throat]

1035
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,108
Hello. This is
Joe Gould speaking.

1036
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,376
Yeah. How are you?

1037
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,978
[sighs]

1038
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,114
Jack, may I have
a beer please?

1039
00:51:57,147 --> 00:52:00,150
[Gould] The last time
I spoke to you, Florence,
you had a bad leg.

1040
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,386
No, I'm just asking

1041
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,589
out of politeness,
for goodness sake.

1042
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,124
Oh, thank you very much.

1043
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,793
[Gould]
I couldn't care less
if your leg fell off!

1044
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,697
-Hello?
-[jiggling phone]

1045
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,899
[screaming]
Hello?!

1046
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,401
You fucking bitch!

1047
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,003
You two-bit flaxen--

1048
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,572
[Jack] Hey, hey!
Joe, easy, easy, easy!

1049
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,641
[Gould yelling]

1050
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,077
-What the hell are you doing?
-[Mitchell] What happened?

1051
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,612
What happened?

1052
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,614
"What happened?"
"What happened?"

1053
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,816
-She hung up on me,
that's what happened.
-Why?

1054
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,751
Why? Why!

1055
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,153
Joe, you broke
this part.

1056
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,788
So what if
I broke it, Jack?!

1057
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,691
It's a fucking
telephone!

1058
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,627
Jesus Christ!

1059
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,897
There are greater things
at stake here than
the fucking telephones!

1060
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,400
There's a thing
of tremendous significance

1061
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,135
languishing in a cellar!

1062
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,605
That carries more
vital words than your
two-bit black bakelite

1063
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,241
bullshit box
will ever carry!

1064
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,410
Jesus Christ, Jack.

1065
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,612
Rise above, will you?
Rise above...

1066
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,716
the everyday,
and step up
to your depths!

1067
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,018
Okay, Joe...

1068
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,252
Joe? Joe?

1069
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,520
-[Gould yells]
-Joe?

1070
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,490
[Gould] God!

1071
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,659
These people!

1072
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,127
Joe, Joe...

1073
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,863
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1074
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,231
No, it's all right.
It's okay.

1075
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:24,501
They are trapped
by the mundane,
by bric-a-brac,

1076
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:29,673
trapped with
no vision, no real...

1077
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,208
-purpose!
-I know, I know.

1078
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,709
Servants.

1079
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,345
It's all right.
It's okay.

1080
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,383
Only the artist
is free, Joe.

1081
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,653
Because he is
single of purpose.

1082
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,489
He knows
what he wants and
wants only that.

1083
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,160
But this, uh,
frightens people.

1084
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:51,561
I don't know.

1085
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,199
Yes.

1086
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,469
I'm really sorry
about all this.

1087
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,670
No, it's all right, Joe.

1088
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,405
-It's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

1089
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,407
No.

1090
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,844
And if you're willing,
I will...

1091
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,016
recite the Oral History
for you.

1092
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,484
Pardon?

1093
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,219
I have
an abnormal memory.

1094
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:21,124
In fact, I have what
psychologists have
termed total recall.

1095
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,593
I have
lost whole chapters
of the Oral History

1096
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,695
and reconstructed them
from memory

1097
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,896
word for word.

1098
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:29,199
Word for word?

1099
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,001
Yes. [chuckles]

1100
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:50,353
[Gould] I have
found that gin primes
the pump of memory.

1101
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,557
So... the Oral History.

1102
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:58,495
I will quote from
the section, "Good Men
Are Dying Like Flies."

1103
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:02,332
Which starts with a brief
biography of side-bet
Benny Altschuler...

1104
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,200
the horse-race gambler,

1105
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,637
who stuck his hand
with a rusty ice pick
and died of lockjaw.

1106
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,339
Then I will quote...

1107
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,242
from an account an old
stumblebum fighter
once gave me.

1108
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,077
Huh. The Deacon.

1109
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,848
The Deacon...
was a gloomy
periodical drinker.

1110
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,483
Had been
in his time a boxer,

1111
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,353
which is the reason
that I refer to him
as a stumblebum.

1112
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,223
He was under the impression
that he'd lost his soul.

1113
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,561
[Gould] And he often
saw things at night.

1114
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,698
One summer night while
he was sitting in a doorway
on Great Jones Street...

1115
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,666
[sniffs] he smelled sulfur...

1116
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,970
and looked up
and saw the Devil walk past.

1117
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:48,778
And later that night
on pier 26 he saw two mermaids.

1118
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,114
"They weren't exactly
half-women, half-fish.

1119
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,049
They were
more like half-women,
half-snakes" he said.

1120
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,452
"And when they saw me
sitting on the pier,
looking at them,

1121
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:59,389
they held out their arms
and wriggled and made
certain other motions,

1122
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,924
trying to tempt me
to come with them.

1123
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,792
And if I had done so,

1124
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,794
they would have wrapped
themselves around me

1125
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,063
and dragged me to
the very bottom of the river."

1126
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,966
"The history of a nation

1127
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:13,336
is not in parliaments
and battlefields,

1128
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,173
but in what
people say to each other
on fair days and high days

1129
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,942
and how they farm
and quarrel...

1130
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,778
and go on pilgrimage."

1131
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:24,214
[chuckles]

1132
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,484
Oral History,
according to Yeats.

1133
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,220
That is the quote
I told you I had read

1134
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,622
that altered
the course of my life.

1135
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,624
[Mitchell] Mm-hmm.

1136
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,460
Your wife,
d-does she mind you
being out this late?

1137
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:40,764
Not at all.
She thinks
I'm with you.

1138
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,233
[Gould laughs]

1139
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,568
[up-tempo music playing]

1140
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,537
[typing]

1141
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,359
[no audible dialogue]

1142
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,545
[Gould] My biographer!

1143
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,979
-[women] Oh!
-This is Mr. Joseph Mitchell.

1144
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,514
Get him a beer!
Get him a beer!

1145
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,917
-Wonderful article.
-So wonderful!
So interesting.

1146
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,585
These are my friends,
Anne and Betsy.

1147
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,753
How are you?
Pleasure to meet you.

1148
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,854
You mind if I
take your coat off?

1149
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:38,922
I'll take my coat off,
all right.

1150
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,757
It's nice to meet you.

1151
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,559
-It's a pleasure to meet
you both. Your name is?
-Yes, Mr. Gould--

1152
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,993
-Betsy?
-Betsy.

1153
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,962
-And I'm Anne.
-Now that's Anne, and I'm Joe.

1154
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,897
Your friend here
has been telling us all
about the Oral History.

1155
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,499
Yes, I have, and I've also
been telling them about

1156
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:52,235
how I measured, you know,
the-- the Indians.

1157
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,437
Oh, the heads of 1,000
Chippewa Indians
in zero weather.

1158
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,540
He knows. He is
well acquainted with
a number of chapters.

1159
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,943
You must
know each other
very well by now.

1160
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,479
I mean, I know him so well
that he's become
part of my past.

1161
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,180
You have your drink.
Is it okay?

1162
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,515
Yeah, I have my drink.
thank you.

1163
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,884
-Joe, I just wanted to
stop by and, uh...
-Yes.

1164
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,386
give these to you.
These are, uh, letters,

1165
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,121
that are addressed to you
care of The New Yorker.

1166
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,723
And I-- and I thought
that you might want them.

1167
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:15,158
Well, thank you.

1168
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,793
-I guess we're not
your only admirers.
-Yes!

1169
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,828
Well, let's open this.

1170
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,030
I don't normally
get letters.

1171
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,633
I don't know anybody,
so let's open it, shall we?

1172
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,801
Yeah.

1173
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,469
-He is quite a handful.
-Yes, he is.

1174
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,104
I'm all fingers
and thumbs here.

1175
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,706
-You live here in New York?
-Uh, yes.

1176
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,140
We-- we work
up in midtown.

1177
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,275
Now, there.

1178
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,644
They're related as well,
I believe.

1179
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,845
Eh, what is this?

1180
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,348
Oh! Oh, you
dropped something,
Mr. Gould.

1181
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,984
"Buy yourself a drink
on me, Tweed Wright."

1182
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:45,755
[squawks]
Yack-a-doodle-doo!
Look at this!

1183
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,524
Do they all got
money in them?

1184
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:48,825
Must be a big fan
of yours.

1185
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,360
Let's see.
There may be
more in here.

1186
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,395
There may be more.
Let's see what this one says.

1187
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:55,298
-You're making out
like a bandit, Joe.
-I know.

1188
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,133
-Just a minute. Look,
there's no money here.
-Oh!

1189
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,369
Oh, I can't believe it,
there's no money in theat.

1190
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,837
-Wait a minute--
-[Mitchell groans]

1191
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,139
-Sure there's no money?
-What does he say?

1192
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,774
No, he says, uh--
This is from

1193
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,142
-a retired Naval officer...
-Oh.

1194
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,478
and he says that,
"I do love seagulls

1195
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,280
very much
the way you do."

1196
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:13,116
-[Gould squawks]
-"I feel that I too can
understand their language."

1197
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,618
Well, isn't that
something, you see?

1198
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,153
We have to get going.

1199
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,421
I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

1200
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,889
Oh, no.
We have to get going.

1201
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:20,957
-Here. Kook.
-I understand.

1202
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,991
$2.00! $2.00!

1203
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,738
Joe! [laughs]
Joe Gould! Joe!

1204
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,840
Oh, Franny.
It's you. Heh.

1205
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,443
I just wanted to say
I saw The New Yorker piece.

1206
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,178
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I didn't know
you could read.

1207
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,715
All right, Joe.
I just wanted to say
I loved it, and bravo!

1208
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,783
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1209
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,284
I just ran into
E.E. Cummings,

1210
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,386
and--and we were
speaking about you.

1211
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,557
and I thought perhaps
that if you wanted to,
uh, stop by next week,

1212
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,892
-you might enjoy it.
-When is-- when is the--

1213
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,126
Uh, Tuesday night.

1214
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,861
No, it could be bad for me.

1215
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,096
Well, you decide.

1216
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,565
Are you-- are you--

1217
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,435
Are you asking me
to join The Ravens, Franny?

1218
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,171
'Cause I'll only come
as a member, you know,
fully fledged.

1219
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,506
Well, of course.

1220
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,942
All right,
I'll think about Tuesday.

1221
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,178
I'll--I'll check
my schedule, which is...

1222
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:16,813
-heating up.
-[chuckles]

1223
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:19,282
No doubt. No doubt.
Very good. Very good.

1224
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,883
-I-I'll see you Tuesday, then.
-Yeah.

1225
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:21,951
[Francis] Perhaps.

1226
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:23,987
Oh, Joe!

1227
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,989
-Joe!
-Yeah?

1228
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,925
Um, I know you don't
intend such a thing,

1229
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,828
but the Oral History
may well turn out
to be a sort of

1230
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,497
X-ray of the soul
of the Bourgeoisie.

1231
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:41,137
What makes you
think that you know
what I don't intend?

1232
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,044
No, I'm sorry, Sarah,

1233
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,278
-It's important. It's important.
-Please!

1234
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,580
[Sarah] I'm sorry.
He says it's important.

1235
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,549
Hi, Joe! [laughs]
Do you have more?

1236
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,852
-More?
-Letters! Letters!

1237
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,655
Uh, yes, I have--
I have more letters,
yes.

1238
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,257
Okay. Here.
Now, Joe, look.

1239
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,992
-Uh--
-What's this, only three?

1240
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,495
Well, I--
I don't write 'em.
I only receive 'em.

1241
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:09,599
Look, Joe, it's just--
it's very difficult for me
to get any work done,

1242
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:13,569
um, if you keep
coming in here.
All right?

1243
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,172
-Now not to be-- but--
-God damn!

1244
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,007
It's just--

1245
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,978
I could--I could
send you the letters
at the Minetta.

1246
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,014
Or-- or I could
bring 'em down there
a couple of times a week

1247
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,083
-if--if that's what--
-They don't like me there.

1248
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,384
[sighs]

1249
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,186
-Why?
-It's something I did
with spaghetti.

1250
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,056
You started this, Joe.

1251
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,424
If you're gonna
lie down with dogs,

1252
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,325
you're gonna have to
expect to get up with fleas.

1253
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,829
Anyway, I've got
some good news,

1254
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,330
some exciting news!

1255
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,701
Really?
What would that be?

1256
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,169
I won't tell you.

1257
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,572
I'll show you.

1258
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,042
[Gould] Since your article,
as you know,

1259
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,045
my notoriety has increased
tenfold, oh, twentyfold.

1260
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,581
I'm invited
to more parties than ever

1261
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,049
and the center of attention

1262
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,452
[Mitchell]
And I know how
you hate that.

1263
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,686
[Gould laughs]

1264
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,655
And so anyway, someone...

1265
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,291
through a friend of mine,
a friend of a friend rather,

1266
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,892
got in touch with
Vivian Marquie,

1267
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,160
whose gallery we went to.

1268
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,997
And this someone is rich
and has decided

1269
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,467
to become my patron,

1270
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,136
giving me $60 a month,

1271
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,838
which pays
for my room and board.

1272
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,674
Or should I say,
giving it to Monsieur Gerard,

1273
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,209
the owner
of this establishment,

1274
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,911
and then he sees to it
that I have a little left over

1275
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,580
for cigarettes and car fare.

1276
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,424
But the condition
for all of it is--

1277
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,960
and this is the thing
that bugs me--

1278
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,529
the donor remains anonymous.

1279
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:50,933
But I will uncover
her identity.

1280
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:59,776
My room. Come on in.
Oh, hey.

1281
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:03,012
-Oh, well, this is
very nice, yes.
-Isn't it? Isn't it?

1282
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,814
Come on in.
Right in. Right in.

1283
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,316
Look around. Look at these.
Look at these.

1284
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,252
Oh, yeah.
It's perfect.

1285
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,920
-I've got everything
-Yes, you do.

1286
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,456
It's wonderful.
And I see you have a...

1287
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,991
-Yes, I got one of them.
-Yeah.

1288
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:17,193
With a moon--
I see the moon
from time to time.

1289
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,362
It shines down when I'm
lying on the bed and--

1290
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:20,997
Try the bed!

1291
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,598
-Oh, no, no!
-Yes! Come on! I insist.

1292
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,667
-All right.
-I insist, Joe.
You gotta try this bed.

1293
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,203
-You have to.
-Oh, yes, that's good, yes.

1294
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,238
Get the legs up!
That's how we do!

1295
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,606
Yeah, lovely isn't it?

1296
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,142

Oh, I don't know.
I just felt a little...

Ooh!

1315
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,672
[Mitchell]
Sit down, girls. Come on.

Hello?

Hello?!

1321
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,892
What?!

1322
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,561
No, he's sleeping
right now.

1323
01:04:58,594 --> 01:04:59,595
Who is--

1324
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,198
Oh!

1325
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:06,302
Oh, well, it's nice--
it's nice to meet you,
too, Mr. Gould.

1326
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,972
No, it's-- it's all right.
I-I had to get up to
answer the phone anyway.

1327
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:12,608
Yeah, well...

1328
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,177
Nothing. I-I'll tell Joe
you called.

1329
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,445
Yes.

1330
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,647
I will.

1331
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,848

-Who was that?
-Well...

1334
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,760
that was your Mr. Gould.

1335
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,328
[groans]

1336
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,663
He's not mine.

01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,299
Well, you're his.

1338
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:41,370
Now, why is he...

1339
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,005
-Well...
-God damn it.

1340
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,774
-he's fond of you, Joe.
-Why the calling?

1341
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:47,176
-He's what?
-He's fond of you.

1342
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:51,013
No, he's not. He told me
that he doesn't even
like Southerners.

1343
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,082

I don't blame him.

The story doesn't end
just because the writer
has finished writing.

1346
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,504
No, go away.

01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:17,707

-Well, just--
He's in the bathroom.

-Gould.

1349
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,677
Oh, all right.
I'll go in my office.

1350
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,946
-Don't tell him that
I'm here. Oh, no. No--
-Well, then, just go in there.

1351
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,848
-I'll go in the office.
-All right, all right,
go in there.

1352
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:31,754
Sarah, would you tell Ross
or whomever that that first
commode is clogged.

1353
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:35,224
It wasn't me. It seems to be
a reoccurring problem.
Is he in yet?

1354
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,159
No actually,
Mr. Gould, he's not.

1355
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,427
Oh, well, I'll just
wait for him.

1356
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,463
Well, you'll have
to wait a long time.

1357
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,631
I don't mind!
[groans]

1358
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,167
Uh, about, um,
two weeks.

1359
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:49,438
What?!
[laughs]

1360
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,542
Well, yes, Mr. Mitchell
is going away for two weeks.

1361
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:54,844
"Away"?

1362
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,312
Vacation.

1363
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:07,890
-"Vacation"?
-Yes.

1364
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:11,961
Why...

1365
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,133
he never said that.
He didn't mention
that to me.

1366
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,568
-[mutters]
-Well, I'm...

1367
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,303
Oh. Uh...

1368
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,475
Uh, eh, where?

1369
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,946
Well, I'm not sure,
really. Um...

1370
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,148
down south, maybe.

1371
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,717
Oh. [chuckles]

1372
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,718
Right.

1373
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,054
Well, uh, okay.

1374
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:42,892
Well, is there...

1375
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,363
something you would like me
to tell him if he calls?

1376
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,134
Excuse me?

1377
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,504
Is there something
I should tell him if--

1378
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,474
-The reason you came by?
-No, no.

1379
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,943
I just came by
because, um...

1380
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,783
I don't know.
[chuckles]

1381
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,719
Well, I'll be sure
to tell him.

1382
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,154
[Gould]
Thank you, Sarah.

1383
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,224
Have a good day,
Mr. Gould.

1384
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,760
[door closes]

1385
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,832
-This is your review? One line?
-I hated it.

1386
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,366
Everyone
loves this movie.

1387
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,102
-Did you see it?
-Yeah.

1388
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,305
What'd you think?

1389
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,673
It's a piece of shit.

1390
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:34,710
All right! All right.

1391
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,514
-Good night, Mr. Ross.
-Good night.

1392
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:39,515
Oh, Mitchell.

1393
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:40,816
-Yes?
-Hey.

1394
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,017
Good stuff, Joe.

1395
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,552
-Oh, oh, well.
-Good stuff!

1396
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,221
Thanks.
Thanks very much.

1397
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,655
What's wrong?

1398
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,091
Oh, nothing.

1399
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,260
Nothing.

1400
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,262
You're sad.

1401
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,898
Are you sad?

1402
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,700
Well...

1403
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,070
a little-- [chuckles]

1404
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,238
No, it's just that...

1405
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,808
Every time when I
finish writing something,

1406
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:09,378
when things end,
I get a little, um--

1407
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,814
This fella, um...

1408
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,485
It's not--
[chuckles] Forget it.

1409
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,720
Forget it.

1410
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,188
It's a great piece.

1411
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,757
-Great piece!
-Oh, well, I know.
I mean, thanks.

1412
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,192
Thanks, I know.
It's just--

1413
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,466
You're kind of
a gloomy guy,
aren't you, Joe?

1414
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,869
Well, I guess.
[chuckles]

1415
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,304
Yes.

1416
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:37,473
Well...

1417
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,011
I'm no goddamn ray
of sunshine myself.

1418
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,722
[Vivian]
As bold and as jazzy
as his paintings are,

1419
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,925
I think somehow
in these drawings,

1420
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:59,662
he's managed
to make them...

1421
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,268
He's managed
to make them as bold,

1422
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,703
but somehow
more intimate.

1423
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,805
They're so beautiful.

1424
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:13,909
But it's best, I think, if
you begin there and kind of
work your way around.

1425
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:18,414
There's, uh--
Most of these are...

1426
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,682
[clears throat]

1427
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,218
-[coughs]
-are, uh, pen...

1428
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,721
Most of these
are pen and ink.

1429
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,891
Except there are
a few that are pencil,
and if you'll see,

1430
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,260
I have a special fondness
for that one.

1431
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,895
But, um...

1432
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,798
-Then there's this
amazing piece.
-Yes.

1433
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:38,033
Which...
[chuckles]

1434
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,702
I keep looking at
every day.

1435
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,238
And every day, I see
something different,
totally different.

1436
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,673
[chuckles]
And, uh...

1437
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,308
Ode to Franz Kline.
Poor old Franz Kline,

1438
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,110
hadn't a dime,
not two nickels
for rubbing together.

1439
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,678
His paintings were great,
but he got famous too late,

1440
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,046
then his soul flew away
like a feather.

1441
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,715
[squawks]

1442
01:10:57,853 --> 01:11:00,256
-Joe, you can't. Please!
-Okay, Vivian. All right.
All right.

1443
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,490
Just give this to her.

1444
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:02,625
To whom?

1445
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,393
You know to whom.
My patron.

1446
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,961
-No. What is it?
-It's a communication.

1447
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,296
-No, Joe.
-[man] Thank you.

1448
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,765
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1449
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,233
Shit!

1450
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,768
-Joe, look!
-Will you give this
to her, please?

1451
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,837
No, I will not.
This is not the way
it's supposed to work.

1452
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,071
Well, then tell me
who she is.

1453
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,740
-I can't!
-Why?

1454
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,541
Because I don't know
who the hell she is.

1455
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,277
I've told you that.
Now just stop
this foolishness,

1456
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,778
and get on with your life.

1457
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,179
How can I?!
How can I?!

1458
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,914
You have to, Joe.

1459
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,450
Vivian, how would you feel
if you knew that somewhere
out there in the world

1460
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:29,952
there was a woman
who cared enough about you

1461
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,553
not to want to see you
starve to death,

1462
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,422
but at the same time
doesn't want anything
to do with you.

1463
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,657
I know. I know.

1464
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:38,327
I mean,
who is this woman?
It plagues me.

1465
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,595
I know.

1466
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,964
Maybe she's a woman
who had an illegitimate baby

1467
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,433
when she was young,
and then one day,
she picks up The New Yorker

1468
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,735
and sees that her baby
was now a middle-aged man.

1469
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,203
-You see what I'm saying?
-Yes. Yes, Joe.

1470
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,939
I-- no--
I'm not taking that.

1471
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,474
I wouldn't know
who to give it to.

1472
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,145
What are you doing now,
what's that?

1473
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:57,513
For the Joe Gould Fund.

1474
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:00,015
No, I'll leave. You don't
have to pay me to leave.

1475
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,551
I am not paying--
Just take the money.

1476
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,254
-Take this.
-I am not.

1477
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,722
-I told you.
-Then forget it.

1478
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:07,856
You're not going
to take the money?

1479
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,091
No, I'm not going
to take the money

1480
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,893
-'cause I have money
in my pockets!
-Joe...

1481
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,829
I'm fine! Really!

1482
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:17,066
I normally
despise the stuff.

1483
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,668
I have very few wants,
like an Indian.

1484
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,873
Anyway, this is
not about money.

1485
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,843
I just want to know.

1486
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,014
I'm sorry, Joe.

1487
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:34,483
I can't help you.

1488
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:43,926
[Mitchell] Yes?

1489
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,194
He's here.

1490
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,196
Oh. Okay.

1491
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,365
So, um, where was I?

1492
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:52,868
[Sarah]
Vacationing down south
for two weeks.

1493
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,137
-Okay. Did you call, um...
-I did.

1494
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,939
-Okay. I'll be right there.
-All right.

1495
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:09,852
Hi.

1496
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:13,989
-Hello.
-[Gould] Hi, Joe!

1497
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,024
-How are you?
-All right. Where we going?

1498
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,227
Oh, well, I have
an appointment if you
don't mind walking with me.

1499
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,129
-Oh, not at all.
-Here. I have your mail.

1500
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,132
-How was your trip?
-Uh, quiet.

1501
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,299
Huh.

1502
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,934
-[Mitchell] Bye, Sarah.
-[Sarah] Bye-bye.

1503
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,803
[door closes]

1504
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:30,239
[Gould] Brooklyn?
What's in Brooklyn?

1505
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,975
Oh, I'm working on a piece
out there about, uh,

1506
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,010
Indians. Mohawk Indians.

1507
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,879
I-is this something new?

1508
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,249
Yes, it's a, uh, uh,
uh, a-- a new piece.

1509
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:44,486
I'm talking to a fella
out there, an old, uh,
Mohawk, who, uh...

1510
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,589
Well, do you...
you visit this fella
every day?

1511
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:52,027
No, not every day.
About two, three times
a week. You know.

1512
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,264
They were part of
the Iroquois Confederacy,
were they not?

1513
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:57,433
-Uh, yes, they were, yes.
-And now they're here
in Brooklyn?

1514
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,501
-Yes, in Brooklyn.
-They were the Ohkonwaga.

1515
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,236
-[Charlie] Joe!
-Yes, as a matter of fact--

1516
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,372
-Oh, Charlie, hi!
-Aren't you supposed
to be working?

1517
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,674
-I am working. I am working.
-Yeah, yeah!

1518
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,409
I knew I should have
been on the other side
of the bindings.

1519
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,944
[laughs]

1520
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,180
Charlie, there's
someone I'd like you
to meet. Joe?

1521
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,881
Come over here
for a moment.

1522
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:15,384
This is a good friend of mine,
this is, uh, Charlie Duell.

1523
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,052
This is Mr. Joseph Gould.

1524
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,687
-Nice to meet you.
-It's a pleasure.

1525
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,889
Though we've never met,
I feel I know you
somewhat, Mr. Gould.

1526
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,958
-Oh, why is that?
-Well, I've been
hearing about you

1527
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,227
and your Oral History from
a great many people for years.

1528
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,595
You've become
quite legendary.

1529
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,497
Well, anyone would
who would attempt
such a thing.

1530
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,399
True. True.

1531
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:32,968
Kenneth Fearing
has been lavish in
his praise of your work.

1532
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,370
Kenneth Fearing?
How do you know
Kenneth Fearing?

1533
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,372
-We publish Kenneth.
-Oh, is that so?

1534
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:40,709
-And "we" as, uh...
-My firm, Duell,
Sloan and Pierce.

1535
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,011
-Yes, not very
reputable at all.
-No, no, no.

1536
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,580
-Especially that first fella.
-No.

1537
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,715
You know, I don't know
if you'd be interested,
Mr. Gould,

1538
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,550
but I would love
to read some of
the Oral History.

1539
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,118
Some of it.
some of it.

1540
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:53,155
Everybody wants to read
some of it! Nobody wants
to just read it!

1541
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,193
Well, from now on,
I'm not gonna let anybody
read just some of it.

1542
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,995
They're gonna read
all of it or none of it.

1543
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,530
Well, I-I'll do that.

1544
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,866
You could bring it by
the office or tell me
where to go pick it up,

1545
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,000
and I'll start
right away.

1546
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,435
No, no, it's
entirely too bulky.

1547
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,170
Well, uh, bring it by
in batches,

1548
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,439
I'll finish reading
one part, and then
I'll give you a call.

1549
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:11,807
-That's sounds-- Yes.
-I don't-- I don't-- I-I--

1550
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,408
'Cause you have a phone
where you are--

1551
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:14,877
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1552
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,411
-You don't have it?
-No. It's, uh, uh--

1553
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:19,414
it's stored
on Long Island.

1554
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:20,983
-And, uh, it's very
hard to get there.
-I see.

1555
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,852
Well, yes, but you do
have some of it here.
I mean, there-- there...

1556
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,255
Yeah, I have some of it.
Yes, but it's all over.

1557
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:30,259
With friends and--
and places and I--
[stammers]

1558
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,461
You wouldn't be able to read
my handwriting, anyway.

1559
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,129
Well, I have
a secretary
who's a wizard

1560
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:35,297
at hard-to-read
handwriting.

1561
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,932
If you brought it by
and sat down with her,

1562
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,700
-till she got the hang
of your handwriting.
-[squawks]

1563
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,103
-She's very good.
-Maybe we could
publish a book of excerpts.

1564
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:42,371
Excerpts?!

1565
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,240
No! Absolutely not!

1566
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,277
Absolutely not.
It has to be published
in its entirety,

1567
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,444
all or nothing.

1568
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,280
Well, if you don't
let me read it,

1569
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,782
and it doesn't appear
that you want me to,

1570
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,985
how can I tell if it's
feasible to publish it
in its entirety?

1571
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,857
I have always resolved
in the back of my mind

1572
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,359
that the Oral History
should be published
posthumously,

1573
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,095
and I'm gonna stick to that.
Because there are certain
revelations in it

1574
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:10,966
that I wouldn't want
the world to know about
until after my death.

1575
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,802
Well, um...

1576
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:14,870
I admire that.

1577
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:19,441
Um, well, I'm late.
So, uh...

1578
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:20,943
-You're late.
-Good to see you, again.

1579
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,377
All right,
nice to see you,
Charlie.

1580
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,979
-And it's a pleasure, Mr. Gould.
-Yes.

1581
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,480
-Glad to see you.
-Bye.

1582
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:26,815
All righty.

1583
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,483
What was
his name again?

1584
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,586
Uh, Charlie. Charlie Duell.
Charlie Duell.

1585
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,422
What-- what time
do you have?

1586
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,958
Uh, it's-- it's just--
just a bit after--

1587
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,793
Listen, uh, I should--
I should get going myself,

1588
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,227
-because I hate to be late.
-Yes.

1589
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,797
-So all right, um...
-I've got an appointment--

1590
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,065
Good luck in Brooklyn.

1591
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,000
Thank you very much.
And I'll see you soon, Joe.

1592
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,501
-Okay, yes, sir.
-All righty. All righty.

1593
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:47,469
Bye.

1594
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,012
[bartender]
Let's go, man. Good night.

1595
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,595
[grunts] Fuck.

1596
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:20,168
You all right, Joe?
Huh? All right.

1597
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,470
-Come on.
-[groans]

1598
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,174
Okay.

1599
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,084
[indistinct conversation]

1600
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:42,357
I need to see him,
even for a minute.

1601
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:43,759
Just-- two at the most!

1602
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,694
[Sarah] Well,
I'm sorry, Mr. Gould.
Look, I'm--

1603
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,562
-Now I have
your mail right here.
-Oh, thank you, thank you.

1604
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:49,164
-Just two minutes--
-No, Mr. Gould.

1605
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,033
You know it is never
just two minutes!

1606
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,534
Oh, my God,
just please wait!

1607
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:53,769
[Gould yells]

1608
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,805
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell.

1609
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:57,939
[Sarah] Could-- Oh--

1610
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,375
Hi. Oh, Christ,

1611
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,843
what a hangover
I've got today.

1612
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:05,747
And not a red cent
to my name for a cup
of even cowboy coffee.

1613
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,650
Um, I'll need you to make
a contribution if you don't
mind, at some point.

1614
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,819
I was up to all hours,
because Monsieur Gerard

1615
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:14,156
has chosen this week
to repaper the hallways.

1616
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,757
Not to mention
the main cause
of my restlessness,

1617
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,292
which is the fact...

1618
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,094
that I still don't know
who my patron is,

1619
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:22,397
even though I've made
dozens of phone calls,
I mean, to--

1620
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,566
Speaking, for instance,
with an old friend of mine,

1621
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:26,368
there are two-- two sisters,

1622
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,004
Charlotte--Charlotte
and Eleanor Adams.

1623
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,740
Who, when I asked if they
were the ones supporting me,

1624
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,775
told me that if I-I--

1625
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,044
if I called them again,
they would phone the police.

1626
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:38,714
Well, they were
so old anyway.
They were really too old.

1627
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:41,450
And there was another woman,
she was very rich,

1628
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,819
and I-I met her
at a cocktail party
in Washington Square,

1629
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:46,321
I think I had--
yeah, I had had
a conversation with her

1630
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,223
about Edgar Allan Poe.

1631
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,325
And so-- So I rang her,
but she was dead.

1632
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,027
[laughs]

1633
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,731
And-- and was dead
for 12 years or so.

1634
01:18:55,764 --> 01:19:00,669
And just countless
phone calls to people
who seem to fit the bill.

1635
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,638
but I-I just
haven't had no luck yet.

1636
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:05,607
And it's driving me mad!

1637
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,876
So much so I have
not been able to write,

1638
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,711
which I recently confided
to a friend of mine.

1639
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,214
Who all he said was,
"Go get a typewriter."

1640
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,249
So I told him
pretty damn quickly,

1641
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,685
that William Shakespeare
didn't sit there,

1642
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,954
pecking on some dirty,
damned $95 doohickey!

1643
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:20,622
And Joe Gould
doesn't either!

1644
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,057
And just looking
at his face made me sick!

1645
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,925
And I longed,
I longed...

1646
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,694
suddenly I longed to be

1647
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,829
on horseback again

1648
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,965
with a sturdy cayuse
under me,

1649
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:31,600
speeding into the sunset

1650
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,069
with the ice breaking up
the Missouri River.

1651
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,105
God damn it!
My head is killing me!

1652
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,514
So you haven't been writing?

1653
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,150
Hm.

1654
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,354
No, I guess not.

1655
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:55,991
Does that bother you?

1656
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:58,093
No.

1657
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:01,997
Does it bother your friend,
Mr. Duell?

1658
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,801
The absurdly persistent
Mr. Duell?

1659
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,871
What exactly
does that mean?

1660
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:14,009
Well, I find our
accidental meeting, Joe...

1661
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:16,178
with your publishing pal

1662
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,612
a little insulting.

1663
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,816
I beg your pardon?

1664
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,718
Listen, if you
want me off your back,

1665
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,221
if you want to get rid
of me, just because
you're now on to Mohawks,

1666
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:27,522
say-- just say so.

1667
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,458
But don't go trying
to palm me off on some...

1668
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,727
two-bit book binder.

1669
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,500
Look, you told me
that you lugged armfuls
of the Oral History

1670
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,802
in and out of 14 different
publishing houses.

1671
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,672
I was trying
to do you a favor.

1672
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,507
You told me that you've
been resolved that this

1673
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,875
would always be
published posthumously,

1674
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:47,876
but I don't believe that.

1675
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,110
But what I am
beginning to believe

1676
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,745
is that the Oral History
doesn't exist.

1677
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,548
It doesn't exist at all.

1678
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,650
That the woman with
the duck and chicken farm
doesn't exist.

1679
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,385
That the belligerent
niece doesn't exist.

1680
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,421
That the cellar that it's
stored in doesn't exist.

1681
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:02,157
None of it exists.
Nothing associated with
the Oral History exists,

1682
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,025
because the Oral History
doesn't exist.

1683
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:07,529
A few scribblings here
and there, but really, no.

1684
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,965
It exists only
in your mind...

1685
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:13,168
but you have just been
too lazy to write it down.

1686
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:42,464
They want the last-minute
changes on the story,
Mr. Mitchell.

1687
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,300
Well, does it have
to be right now?

1688
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,535
They're telling me
it cannot wait.

1689
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,940
Okay, all right.
Okay.

1690
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:52,941
Okay. All right.
All right.

1691
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:54,075
All right, thank you.

1692
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,881
Joe...

1693
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,316
look...

1694
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,987
Uh, no,
I-I dropped by anyway...

1695
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,459
Dropped by
for a contribution.

1696
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,828
Well, all right, here.
Let-- let me give you
something.

1697
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,231
-No, no, it's fine.
-No, no, I have a little
something here for you.

1698
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,966
I do. Here.

1699
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,401
Please take this.

1700
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:21,703
Please.

1701
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,539
No, thank you.

1702
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,325
Oh, hi, Daddy!

1703
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,497
[Gould] The insane person
is a victim of self-deception.

1704
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:53,401
Yet in a measure,
we all have this virtue.

1705
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,204
One is his own
imaginary creation of himself.

1706
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:59,541
If we could see ourselves
for what we really are...

1707
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:02,410
life would be
insupportable.

1708
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,245
Hence, I would judge
the sanest man

1709
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,648
to be him
who most firmly realizes

1710
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,483
the tragic isolation
of humanity

1711
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:11,920
and pursues
his essential purpose calmly.

1712
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:17,959
I suppose I feel about it
in this way because I have
a delusion of grandeur.

1713
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:22,397
I believe myself
to be Joe Gould.

1714
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,437
[party chatter]

1715
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,909
-No, I write for a magazine.
We both write for a magazine.
-Oh!

1716
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,177
The same magazine.

1717
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,979
I don't read
magazines.

1718
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,114
-Why?
-You don't? Why?

1719
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,316
I just don't like
the feel of paper.

1720
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,119
-Do tell.
-Never heard that one before.

1721
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,755
I read the newspaper,
and I read books.

1722
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:48,523
So if you write a book,
I'll read it.

1723
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:49,891
-All right.
-He's writing a book.

1724
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:52,594
No, no, I'm not
writing a book.
Uh-uh. No.

1725
01:23:52,627 --> 01:23:54,929
No, you're writing--
Aren't you writing a book?

1726
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,097
It's about the South.

1727
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:58,333
Hey! An angel's arrived.

1728
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:59,901
[laughs]

1729
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,603
-About the South, huh?
-No, no.

1730
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:02,837
Now what about
the South?

1731
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,140
Well, no, it's not
about the South exactly.

1732
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,842
It's about-- [clears throat]
It's about a fella
from the South

1733
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,612
who comes to, uh,
New York City.

1734
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:12,781
And, um...
Well, that's, you know...

1735
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,349
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1736
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:17,419
Well, it's
just about he comes here
and feels more at home

1737
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,587
here than
he does, um, uh--

1738
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,523
-Back home.
-Back home, yeah.

1739
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:22,957
Yeah, that's--
that's all.

1740
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,760
So, uh, well...

1741
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,429
what happens?

1742
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:28,630
Well, nothing.

1743
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,532
[laughs]
No, no, no.

1744
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,201
-Falls in love with
a woman who is, uh...
-Uh-huh.

1745
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,103
uh, mysterious.

1746
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:37,505
Mysterious to him--
As mysterious as
the city is to him.

1747
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:40,141
And, um, uh...

1748
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,443
she's Scandinavian.

1749
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:44,212
-That's nice.
-Yes, yes. And he loves her.

1750
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,849
He loves her,
and, um, well...

1751
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:51,786
Well, he, it's just about--
about he wanders
around the city,

1752
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,756
walking and
listening to people,

1753
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:56,458
and he runs into
different people,

1754
01:24:56,491 --> 01:25:00,428
people who...
everybody represents
a different part

1755
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,397
of the city, that--
that he encounters.

1756
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,232
Um, and, um, uh,

1757
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,268
Well, I should say
that he was a believer
at one time,

1758
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,003
but he no longer
is a believer.

1759
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:12,006
-However, he does still see
things in terms of religion.
-Uh-huh.

1760
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,441
Um, so, um,

1761
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,111
and so the city becomes
for him kind of a...

1762
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,412
a kind of hell.

1763
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,913
Oh, so he hates it?

1764
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,315
No, no, no, he loves it.
He loves it.

1765
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:24,052
But, uh--
but, the, um, uh--

1766
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,788
It's just walking
through the city

1767
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,491
and listening to people,
and, um...

1768
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,393
-It's-- the city's
so full, you know?
-Uh-huh.

1769
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:34,295
Um, and the people.

1770
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:36,531
Um, he's just...

1771
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,601
he's-- he's searchin'.

1772
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,170
-You know?
-What's he searching for?

1773
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:43,505
I-I don't know.

1774
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,740
He doesn't know.
[laughs]

1775
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:48,376
-Anyways, that's the gist of it.
-Uh-huh.

1776
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,879
-That is the gist of it.
-Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:54,516
Joe, that there,
that-- that sure
is something.

1778
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:57,018
-Well, it's something. Maybe.
-How far along are you?

1779
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,119
Pardon?

1780
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,621
I say, how far along
are you?

1781
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:01,856
Uh... well, not very.

1782
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,291
I just--
I was just doing a little...

1783
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,026
-Working it out.
-Making no-- Yup!

1784
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,661
Exactly.

1785
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,796
-It's all up here.
-[chuckles] Yes, sir.

1786
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,832
Well, now.

1787
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,567
Do you-- May I take
one of your cigarettes
from you?

1788
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,836
Well, yeah, yeah.

1789
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,571
[Mitchell laughs]

1790
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,973
[Nora] Remember not
to step on the line!

1791
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,176
-Yeah!
-You'll fall through the cracks!

1792
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,610
-Yeah!
-And die!

1793
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:24,679

-You're it!
-[giggles]

1795
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:33,188
Doo-doo. Ah!

1796
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:35,156
-I died!
-[laughing]

1797
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,125
Dad, where
are we going?

1798
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:38,359
[Elizabeth]
Yeah, where are we
going, Dad?

1799
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:41,529
Dad?

1800
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:42,597
Dad?

1801
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,933
Uh, no-nowhere.
I just, um...

1802
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,703
-Thought I saw someone. Come on.
-Okay.

[radio broadcast
playing indistinctly]

1805
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:01,482
Hello?

1806
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:22,337
Joe?

1807
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:28,676
Joe?

1808
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:21,529
[Mitchell]
Oh, God.

1809
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,201
[Gould] Not long ago,
I came upon a word

1810
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:30,204
in the dictionary that sums up
the way I was as a boy

1811
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,307
and, for that matter,
the way I am now.

1812
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,542
The word is "ambisinistrous,"

1813
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:37,278
or left-handed in both hands.

1814
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,747
My father didn't know
what to make of me,
and my mother...

1815
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:42,884
Well, one particular evening,
we were sitting in the parlor,

1816
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:45,253
and I was studying,
and I happened to look up

1817
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:48,523
and saw that she was looking
at me and that tears were
running down her cheeks.

1818
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:50,692
And she saw that I saw her.

1819
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,493
And what she said,

1820
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:54,462
what all she said was,

1821
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:59,067
"My poor son. My poor son.
My poor son."

1822
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:16,484
[door opens]

1823
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:17,885

[applause over radio]

1826
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,277
What's it like outside?

1827
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:46,914
It's cold.

1828
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,359
Have I done
something wrong?

1829
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,694
[Vivian]
Joe, I don't know.

1830
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:07,034
How could she
just turn against--
She can't do that.

1831
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,604
Maybe she can't
afford it any longer.

1832
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:11,506
She's wealthy beyond...

1833
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,142
I can't! I can't!

1834
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:18,579
How am I supposed
to live?!

1835
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:20,181
I know.

1836
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:28,523
When?

1837
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,191
I was told
the end of December.

1838
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,628
-And that's it?
-Your subsidy ends.

1839
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:44,505
[Gould]
You're penalizing me
because I don't live

1840
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:45,640
like most people.

1841
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:47,375
[Gerard]
This is not true,
Mr. Gould.

1842
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,977
Then why are you doing this?

1843
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,079
Because it is the policy
of the Maison.

1844
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,186
Is it your policy
to be cruel?

1845
01:30:58,219 --> 01:31:01,022
Mr. Gould, please,
don't make this
uncomfortable for me.

1846
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,090
Uncomfortable for you?
Uncomfortable for you?

1847
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,026
[mock French]
Pardonnez moi,
Monsieur Gerard,

1848
01:31:05,059 --> 01:31:07,762
but I think that I'm
the party being made
uncomfortable here, not you.

1849
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,497
I understand. I'm sorry.

1850
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:12,166
Why can't you help me?
Hmm? Why can't you be
more flexible?

1851
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,001
Why can't you recognize
the way that I live?

1852
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:15,736
That I don't live
week by week,

1853
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,004
or month to month,
like most people.

1854
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:18,339
-I understand--
-But day by day!

1855
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:20,174
-On a day-to-day basis!
-I know.

1856
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:22,777
On a hour to hour
basis, mostly!

1857
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,279
So then it only
makes sense that I
pay by the night.

1858
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,781
-No.
-Why?!

1859
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,316
-Because you can't.
-Why?!

1860
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:29,917
Because...

1861
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:31,886
you can't.

1862
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:33,387
This is not a flophouse.

1863
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:34,789
You're right!

1864
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,591
It's worse!

1865
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:43,030
[light piano playing]

1866
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,239
[music playing only]

1867
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,139
-Joe?
-[Gould] Oh, who's there?

1868
01:32:58,172 --> 01:33:00,041
Alice.

1869
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:03,010
Alice. Dear Alice.
Oh-ho!

1870
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:06,480
Goodness. My eye's running.
I couldn't see.

1871
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,282
-Yeah. How you doing?
-Oh, fine. Fine.

1872
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,151
It's just, uh, cold,
and I...

1873
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,652
Hey...

1874
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:13,454
will you buy me
some breakfast?

1875
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,756
I'll make you
some breakfast.

1876
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,958
[chuckles]

1877
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:29,437
So would you
let me take this?

1878
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:30,771
Yeah. Be careful.

1879
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:32,940
Yeah? Very careful.
I'll put it right here.

1880
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,477
[bell tolling]

1881
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:39,480
Give me your coat.

1882
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:40,514
Oh!

1883
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:41,716
I got it. I got it.

1884
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:44,485
All right, so...

1885
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:46,320
what can I get for you?

1886
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:50,658
Can you make me
some spinach and vinegar?

1887
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:51,926
Sure.

1888
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,527
I just gotta run out
for the spinach.

1889
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:55,529
Well, no, no.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean--

1890
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:57,398
-Don't bother, please.
-No, it's not a bother.

1891
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:58,866
-No, no, no...
-No, it's okay.

1892
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:01,669
[chuckles]
I tell you, I can't hold
anything down anyway,

1893
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:03,371
so a cup of coffee
would just be fine.

1894
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:05,239
Can you do that?
Coffee?

1895
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:06,607
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1896
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,742
Coffee's all ready.
I'll get it.

1897
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:08,776
Why don't you
sit down?

1898
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:13,648
[groans]

1899
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:16,984
[Alice]
How's the Oral History
coming, Joe?

1900
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:18,653
Oh, it's, uh, you know...

1901
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:22,289
I don't really have
the energy to talk about

1902
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,025
the Oral History
right now, Alice.

1903
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,137
[sighs]

1904
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:39,306
Oh!

1905
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,077
My legs.

1906
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:44,445
[chuckles]

1907
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,285
[grunts]

1908
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:52,253
Go on.

1909
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,299
Nice. Thank you.

1910
01:35:05,332 --> 01:35:06,333
[chuckles]

1911
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:09,904
Where you
living now, Joe?

1912
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:11,839
Oh, flophouses mostly.

1913
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,042
Thought you were
at the Maison.

1914
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,244
[chuckles]
No, I left there.

1915
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:19,113
-Why?
-A number of reasons.

1916
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:22,049
But mostly...

1917
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:25,519
Why, I just realized
that I could not write
a true account

1918
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,923
of the people
of this city without
being out a-amongst them.

1919
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,459
Once you start getting
too comfortable,

1920
01:35:31,492 --> 01:35:33,928
then the truth
becomes elusive.

1921
01:35:36,363 --> 01:35:39,400
-But, Joe--
-You know that as a painter

1922
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,235
Oh, yes, of course,
but...

1923
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:44,004
there are levels...

1924
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,406
of discomfort.

1925
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:49,810
Yes, I-I know
what you're saying.

1926
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,412
I know what you're saying,
but it's just,

1927
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,747
um...

1928
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,949
eh, it just
has to be that way.

1929
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:04,492
You have to take care
of yourself, Joe,
physically.

1930
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:06,894
You have to.

1931
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,364
Because...

1932
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,967
no one else will.

1933
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,569
That's, uh--

1934
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,537
Yes.

1935
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:29,950
[Alice]
Dear Mr. Mitchell,

1936
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:32,920
Joe Gould is in bad shape.

1937
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:36,390
He's using up his time
and energy he should be
devoting to writing

1938
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:39,360
getting together
enough dimes and quarters
for the bare necessities.

1939
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:41,896
It's killing him.

1940
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:47,468
I've always felt
that the city's unconscious

1941
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:50,004
may be trying to speak to us
through Joe Gould...

1942
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:58,212
and the people who have
gone underground in the city...

1943
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:02,316
the city's living dead...

1944
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,887
people who never belonged
any place from the beginning...

1945
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:11,325
people sitting
in dark barrooms,

1946
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:13,460
the ones who are
always left out...

1947
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:18,566
the ones
who were never asked.

1948
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:25,906
There is a great danger
that Joe Gould may never
finish the Oral History

1949
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,576
and that those
anonymous voices

1950
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:30,244
may never speak to us.

1951
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:40,821
[music playing only]

1952
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:50,524
[piano music playing]

1953
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:51,825
Good night.

1954
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:54,895
Bye-bye, Monica.
See you later.

1955
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,066
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1956
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:01,235
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I was hoping
to get a chance

1957
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:03,203
to speak with you
before you go, Mr. Mitchell.

1958
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:05,239
-Yes.
-I'm Kim Maxwell.

1959
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:06,874
-How do? Joe Mitchell.
-Hello.

1960
01:39:06,907 --> 01:39:08,008
This is my wife Therese.

1961
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,276
-Hello.
-Hello.

1962
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,578
I'm a psychiatrist
at Pilgrim State Hospital.

1963
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:14,415
Oh, well, I-I will
definitely be
leaving then.

1964
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:15,783
[laughs]

1965
01:39:15,816 --> 01:39:18,018
No, no, no.
I just wanted to
let you know that

1966
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,955
we have an old friend
of yours out there.

1967
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:22,423
-Where? At Pilgrim State?
-Yes.

1968
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:23,924
The man you wrote about.

1969
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,192
Joe Gould.

1970
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:27,461
Oh.

1971
01:39:42,943 --> 01:39:43,944
[Mitchell] Joe?

1972
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:05,499
I always forget how--
how pretty it is up here.

1973
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,203
I haven't been up
to these parts in a while.

1974
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,640
Reminds me, uh...

1975
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,009
quite a bit of Fairmont.

1976
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:19,513
Very pretty.

1977
01:40:26,954 --> 01:40:30,257
Well, you'll be
happy to know that I
brought you something.

1978
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:34,028
Um... I did some soliciting
for the Joe Gould Fund.

1979
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:38,032
[chuckles]
I went to, uh, Alice Neel

1980
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:39,900
and, uh, Harry Kolis
from the Jefferson

1981
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:43,904
and Max and Sadie from
the, uh, Vanguard, and...

1982
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:47,408
Well, anyway...

1983
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:50,010
I thought this
might come in handy.

1984
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,245
Here you go.

1985
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:00,020
In New York...

1986
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:02,990
I was always going here
and going there...

1987
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:06,527
soliciting for
the Joe Gould Fund.

1988
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:09,363
It was hard.

1989
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:15,069
You get a train
of thought and...

1990
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:17,604
there'd be a horn
or a siren,

1991
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:19,673
and you lose
that thought and then...

1992
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:23,110
lose momentum.
The whole day...

1993
01:41:25,012 --> 01:41:26,580
whole day
would just be lost.

1994
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,719
But out here,
it's kinda peaceful.

1995
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:37,991
Might be able
to write out here.

1996
01:41:44,198 --> 01:41:45,933
I'm glad I was able
to see you, Joe.

1997
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:50,871
When you see
all those folks...

1998
01:41:52,473 --> 01:41:53,407
tell them...

1999
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:57,277
it wasn't...

2000
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,620
It was never
a question of laziness.

2001
01:42:14,428 --> 01:42:15,562
Bye, Joe.

2002
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:53,534
[Mitchell]
Joe Gould died in 1957.

2003
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:56,603
Soon afterwards,
many people who knew him

2004
01:42:56,637 --> 01:42:59,940
asked me if I would help them
search for the Oral History.

2005
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:01,842
I thought of telling them
that I knew

2006
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:04,511
that the Oral History
did not exist,

2007
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:06,180
but one of the things
I have learned,

2008
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:07,614
going through life,

2009
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:12,152
is that there is a time
and a place for everything.

2010
01:43:12,186 --> 01:43:14,521
"Yes," I said,
I would help them.

2011
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:17,925
"Yes, of course, I will."

2012
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,893
[instrumental playing]

2013
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,567
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

2014
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,969
for your listening
and, uh, relaxing pleasure,

2015
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,304
once again,
