1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,071
(music playing)

2
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:18,385
(suspenseful music)

3
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,639
Corey: Soon as we get settled in, we'll get you to a doctor.

4
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,709
Hopefully, it won't

5
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,911
cost too much

6
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:23,182
Sydney: So, this is it.

7
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,552
Starting over?

8
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,428
Corey: Are you scared?

9
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,032
Sydney: No, just day dreaming.

10
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,036
(music continues)

11
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:09,762
(tricycle pedaling on sidewalk)

12
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,031
Corey: Matt, be careful!

13
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,046
Well, this is it.

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,816
It's something.

15
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,619
It's ours.

16
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,687
Rent's cheap.

17
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:38,791
Sydney: Yeah, I guess it beats an apartment, right?

18
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,161
Corey: Gotta get going. I'm late.

19
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:43,729
Sydney: For what?

20
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,298
Corey: Gotta meet my new boss.

21
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,568
I know, no business trips.

22
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,237
Sydney: Promise?

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,339
Corey: I promise.

24
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:58,077
Hey, a man's supposed to take care of his wife and kid.

25
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,648
What's he worth if he can't do that, right?

26
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,484
(kiss)

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,233
(suspenseful music)

28
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:28,341
(panting)

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,586
(eerie sounds)

30
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:56,102
(rain falling)

31
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:08,181
(eerie noises)

32
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:52,191
(thunder)

33
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:59,399
(suspensful music)

34
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,337
(coughing)

35
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:25,724
Doctor: You're lucky to be alive

36
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:28,060
after taking a fall like that.

37
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,662
Matt: Mommy, can we go now?

38
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,097
Sydney: Yeah, in a minute, sweetie.

39
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:32,998
Let me talk to him.

40
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,500
Go sit over there.

41
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,202
Doctor: So, your husband doesn't have

42
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:38,770
insurance with his job, what-

43
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:41,073
Sydney: No, well, he does.

44
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,977
It's just it's $500 a month for a family plan.

45
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,512
Can't really afford that.

46
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,315
Doctor: Right, yeah. Insurance, ouch.

47
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,151
Well, based on the reports that came back,

48
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,253
it looks like you have thyroid cancer.

49
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,888
It's a medullary thyroid cancer.

50
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:56,622
It's genetic.

51
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:59,125
It's really not that big a deal.

52
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,660
From a financial standpoint,

53
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,462
after the initial treatment, which is only $1,500,

54
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:06,098
you're looking at maybe $200 a month

55
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,333
for the first six months for your office visits

56
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,836
and your medication.

57
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,872
That's with my discount.

58
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,507
Sydney: Am I gonna ...

59
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,313
Is this life threatening?

60
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,215
Doctor: Yes and no.

61
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,617
Yes, if it goes untreated,

62
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,653
but no if we take care of it right now.

63
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,256
Sydney: I don't have this kind of money.

64
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,425
Doctor: Well, this cancer could spread to your lymph nodes

65
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,726
or other parts of your body.

66
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,496
We're not going to know until we do more tests.

67
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,064
It's not a death sentence,

68
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,400
but it does need to be taken care of,

69
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,801
and the fact that you've had hand tremors,

70
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,170
you're tired, and you're dealing with weight loss

71
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,939
leads me to believe that you're also dealing with

72
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,374
some hyperthyroidism.

73
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,410
So, what we need to do is to destroy the thyroid,

74
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:54,179
and take care of both problems, no chemo.

75
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,314
(toy squeaks)

76
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:56,315
Doctor: Son ...

77
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,417
You're kid is playing with my globe.

78
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,618
(sighs)

79
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,653
Sydney: Matt, grab your stuff, babe.

80
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,155
Let's go.

81
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,223
Doctor: Thanks.

82
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,424
One more thing.

83
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,959
You're a runner, right?

84
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,761
Uh-uh, no more.

85
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:12,432
You're putting way too much stress on your body.

86
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:23,743
Corey: I don't have the money to save you.

87
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,878
Sydney: Yeah, I know.

88
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,012
I was going to get a job,

89
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:27,880
but I don't want somebody else

90
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:29,916
watching Matt after school.

91
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,455
Corey: When I was in the Marines, I solved problems,

92
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:36,889
(snaps fingers)

93
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:37,890
just like that.

94
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:38,757
(chair squeaks)

95
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,727
You see a problem, you fix it.

96
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,365
In war, I was a hero.

97
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,704
I bet you didn't know that about your dad, huh?

98
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,604
Sydney: You know what?

99
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,007
I have heard all of this before, Corey.

100
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,877
This is real life. I don't need a hero!

101
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,118
Why'd you marry me?

102
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:10,189
Sydney: Are you serious?

103
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,759
Corey: Why? Huh?

104
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,165
Sydney: Because you and I make sense, Corey.

105
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,767
Okay? That's why.

106
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,036
(chair squeaks)

107
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:30,343
Matt: Daddy, what's the matter with Mommy?

108
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:42,555
(melancholy music)

109
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:13,319
(typing sounds)

110
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,778
Sydney: Just will have to see what he says.

111
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,378
Okay.

112
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,213
(door opens)

113
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,414
Corey: Syd.

114
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,081
Matt: Daddy, you're home!

115
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:44,316
Sydney: Oh, hey, Corey's home.

116
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,351
Okay. Let me call you back.

117
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,852
All right, bye.

118
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,088
Sydney, Hey Corey, I finished my script.

119
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,389
This is the one that could make it.

120
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,625
I feel it. I want you to read it.

121
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,727
Corey: I've got news.

122
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,998
I'm in a line for a promotion.

123
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,934
Sydney: A promotion, that's great.

124
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,169
(kiss)

125
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,842
Hey bud. Whatcha doin'?

126
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,877
Matt: Drawing.

127
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,878
Can I help you?

128
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,712
Matt: Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,083
Sydney: All right. Scootch over.

130
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,550
(music playing)

131
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,452
You wanna go play?

132
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,387
Go.

133
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,338
(water squirts)

134
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:41,474
Matt: Hey!

135
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,512
Mommy, Mommy! He squirt me in the face!

136
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,752
You okay?

137
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,988
Did you get water in your eyes, babe?

138
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,426
Jane: Tony, what are you doing?

139
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,260
Tony: Mom, I'm just playing.

140
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,663
Sydney: It's okay. I think he actually liked it.

141
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,597
Jane: I'm sorry.

142
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,767
Sydney: It's okay.

143
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,271
Jane: So why'd you guys move in here?

144
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,973
A new job, or ...?

145
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,176
Sydney: Actually, it was my husband's job.

146
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,044
He's a private investigator.

147
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,015
Jane: Oh, really? That must be really exciting.

148
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,283
Sydney: Yeah.

149
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,186
Jane: Okay, well, this is me.

150
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,286
(baby talk)

151
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,455
Sydney: This is it?

152
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:34,093
Jane: Yeah, it's simple, but that's me.

153
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,093
You wanna come in?

154
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:35,594
Sydney: Sure.

155
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:36,662
Jane: Yeah.

156
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,469
(laughing)

157
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,136
Come on in.

158
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,272
Yay!

159
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,741
Music time.

160
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,042
(music plays on radio)

161
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,777
Sydney: You have a beautiful home.

162
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,379
Jane: Thank you.

163
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:58,584
Sydney: So, what do you and your husband do for fun?

164
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,454
Jane: We visit him in prison once a month.

165
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,324
Sydney: I'm sorry, Jane. I didn't know.

166
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,726
Jane: No, it's okay. I'm a big girl.

167
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,330
(upbeat music continues)

168
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,174
Are you a writer?

169
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,308
Sydney: What?

170
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:23,875
(music stops)

171
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,277
Jane: Are you a writer?

172
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,847
Sydney: Oh, yeah, but screenwriter.

173
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,416
Jane: Get out! Oh, my God.

174
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,884
Sit, I have to show you something.

175
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:38,056
This is so amazing because I'm a writer too.

176
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,692
Well, actually, you know, poems and stuff.

177
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,462
But, actually, let me show you.

178
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,765
(page turns)

179
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,567
This one, read this one.

180
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,670
Oh, this one. Yeah.

181
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,241
It's from a long time ago, don't worry.

182
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:59,445
It's just scars. I was a kid.

183
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,213
Yeah, this one.

184
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:01,747
Sydney: Okay.

185
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,182
Jane: Oh. I'll take him.

186
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,185
Come here, Mr.

187
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,821
Mr. Crabby Pants.

188
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:18,630
Bill: Oh, we've got a huge new pool,

189
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:19,898
and a great new golf course.

190
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,567
You're absolutely gonna love it.

191
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,300
Oh, absolutely.

192
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,436
It'll be the time of your life.

193
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,906
I swear, the best time you'll ever have will be here.

194
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:29,775
Corey: Excuse me, sir.

195
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,809
Bill: Excuse me a second.

196
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,511
I think I have a fire to put out.

197
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,513
I'll call you back shortly.

198
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,447
(hangs up phone)

199
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:45,457
Corey: I need a raise without the promotion.

200
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,693
Bill: Everybody needs more money, Corey,

201
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,128
and you know the only way to get the smallest increase

202
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,732
is to take on more work and travel all the time

203
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,300
and take a promotion.

204
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,902
How long have you been with the company?

205
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,470
A year, year and a half?

206
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,073
Eight years?

207
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:06,211
You do good work, but you need to be a man about this.

208
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,648
If you want more money, you need to do more work.

209
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,517
Case closed.

210
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,455
Corey: Let me ask you something, Bill.

211
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,992
You ever been a hero?

212
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,696
Bill: Excuse me? You mean like Superman?

213
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:26,798
Corey: I served in the United States Marine Corps.

214
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:31,136
Desert Storm, and I was a leader.

215
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,706
I never let my unit down.

216
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,411
I need you to let me be a hero again.

217
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,045
(laughs)

218
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,815
Bill: Not going to happen.

219
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,683
(music plays)

220
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,053
Sydney: Oh, I got a whole new list of literary agents today,

221
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:52,190
and Jane may even have some new contacts for me.

222
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,327
It's like six degrees of separation, you know?

223
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,831
Matt: Me and Mommy met new friends today.

224
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,504
Corey: I see. That's nice.

225
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,041
Sydney: You know, I can just see myself

226
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,277
getting a contract, an agent, everything.

227
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,480
Corey: Sydney, you're dying.

228
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:21,954
You're thinking about being a star, Hollywood.

229
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,222
(scoffs)

230
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:37,269
Listen, I gotta go up to Utah for a week, tomorrow.

231
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,538
Sydney: You know, you promised

232
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,706
that we would go hiking tomorrow.

233
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:43,909
Corey: I'm doing the best I can.

234
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:53,852
Feels like, like we're running out of time.

235
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,722
I don't know if I can make an extra $1,500

236
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:01,627
in the next couple of months.

237
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,265
(sighs)

238
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,971
I think there's $500 credit left on here.

239
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,507
Maybe that can be a down payment or something.

240
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,976
I don't know.

241
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,948
Sydney: (sighs) Why can't we just have fun?

242
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,150
You know, maybe just one day a week.

243
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,419
(loud boom)

244
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,357
Corey: DUNCAN!

245
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,528
(gun fire)

246
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:40,899
Duncan: I am not gonna die for nothing!

247
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:41,633
Corey: Don't talk like that.

248
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,102
I'm gonna get you outta here.

249
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,238
Duncan: I don't think I'm gonna make it.

250
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,374
I can't feel anything below my waist.

251
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,274
(crying)

252
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,243
Marine: Come on. Now, let's go.

253
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,644
Let's go!

254
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,747
Corey: I can't. I gotta stop the bleeding.

255
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,116
Marine: Get your goddamn shit together, jarhead!

256
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,085
Fucking move!

257
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,355
Corey: Come on, man. Come on.

258
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,556
Come on!

259
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,027
(explosion)

260
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,341
(baby cries)

261
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,512
Jane: You have to be the healthiest person I know.

262
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,282
i'd kill for a body like yours.

263
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,986
Sydney: Well?

264
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,587
Jane: Well, what?

265
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,254
(laughs)

266
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,756
Sydney: Come on.

267
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,893
Jane: Okay, it was really good.

268
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,496
I was in fucking tears.

269
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:45,830
Sydney: You're not just saying that, are you?

270
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,766
Jane: Oh, my God. I almost peed myself

271
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,667
when they finally slept together.

272
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,469
Oh, it was so good.

273
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,406
Sydney: Well, maybe this time I can get an agent.

274
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,407
You know, I don't get it.

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,775
I don't know that they want.

276
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:59,310
Jane: Well, I think they're looking for that thing,

277
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,646
that thing that everybody's looking for.

278
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,347
(baby coos)

279
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,984
Jane: Aww, baby.

280
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,387
Do you like donuts?

281
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,789
I love donuts!

282
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:11,856
(laughs)

283
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,925
Sydney: I guess, not exactly the healthiest thing,

284
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,695
but I guess if there's nothing else to eat.

285
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,431
Jane: Do you always do what you're supposed to do?

286
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,300
Sydney: I try to.

287
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,802
(laughs)

288
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,573
Jane: You're special.

289
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,207
I mean you're young and ambitious,

290
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,542
and you know what you want,

291
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:31,910
and you have a purpose,

292
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,711
and, I don't know.

293
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,313
I'm just trying to figure out mine.

294
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:38,784
You know? Still asking God.

295
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,917
(laughs)

296
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:44,423
Sydney: Since when did start talking to people?

297
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,127
(music playing)

298
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,232
(typing)

299
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:29,601
(circus music)

300
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,136
TV Clown: Yes, baby.

301
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,106
Romey and Jules forever.

302
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:42,047
(romantic music)

303
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,619
Sydney: That was a poorly-written script.

304
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:52,590
Jane: Mm-hmm, and they made it into a movie.

305
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,593
Sydney: I know. It stunk.

306
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,562
And that guy made it.

307
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,397
I can write better than that.

308
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,599
Jane: Yeah, you're right.

309
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,569
You can, and you have.

310
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:07,305
(laughs)

311
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:11,309
Jane: Okay, so what are your all-time favorites?

312
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,178
Sydney: 'American Beauty'.

313
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,445
'Boys Don't Cry'.

314
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,447
'Girl, Interrupted'.

315
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,718
Oh, all time favorite, 'Shawshank Redemption'.

316
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,087
Yeah, it's this guy who gets framed

317
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,724
for the double murder of his wife and her lover.

318
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:30,762
He's in prison by society, but not in his mind.

319
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,531
His mind, he's free.

320
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,434
Otherwise, what would keep him, you know,

321
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,570
moving forward 'cause he's physically in bondage, so ...

322
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,940
Jane: Wow.

323
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,609
(laughs)

324
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,711
Jane: You know, I've never met anybody like you.

325
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:49,347
(laughs)

326
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,283
Sydney: Well, we're even.

327
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,151
'cause I've never met anyone that God talks to.

328
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:54,986
Jane: Hey!

329
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,955
(laughs)

330
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,127
(door opens)

331
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,396
Matt: Daddy, what'd you bring me?

332
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,332
Corey: Hey, Buddy. Guess.

333
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,267
Matt: Dad,

334
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,835
Matt: what'd you bring me?

335
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,872
Corey: You know I wouldn't forget about you, Buddy.

336
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:22,748
(footsteps)

337
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,651
Hey.

338
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,227
What's it been, two weeks?

339
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,331
Sydney: I'm gonna burn the sauce.

340
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,934
Corey: Come on.

341
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:46,672
Turn on some cartoons for Matt,

342
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,545
take you in the bedroom and turn you on.

343
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,716
Sydney: Stop, please.

344
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,189
Corey: Was there something you wanted to talk about?

345
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:09,894
(dramatic music)

346
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,862
(knocking)

347
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,230
(door opens)

348
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:14,866
Jane: Hi!

349
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,905
Did I interrupt something?

350
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,073
Corey: And you are?

351
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,574
Jane: Jane!

352
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,745
And my sons. This is Tony and John.

353
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,947
(baby talk)

354
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:36,554
Corey: Right. She's out jogging.

355
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:39,358
Jane: Well, she is a runner.

356
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,494
Corey: Yeah, she goes out running

357
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,797
when she wants to avoid confrontation.

358
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,132
Jane: Did you do something?

359
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:49,100
(giggles)

360
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,902
You shouldn't give her anything to confront.

361
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:54,506
Happy wife, happy life, right?

362
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,308
Right.

363
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:02,213
Well, just tell her I said hi, and I'll see her tomorrow,

364
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,749
if you could.

365
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,387
Come on, baby.

366
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,469
Corey: Hey.

367
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,338
Sydney: Hey.

368
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,975
Sorry about earlier.

369
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,057
Corey: Is that so bad I just want to make love

370
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,994
to my wife sometimes?

371
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:56,168
(whispers) Come here.

372
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:13,351
(heavy breathing)

373
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,962
(Sydney crying)

374
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:42,514
(crying silently)

375
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,216
Sydney: If anybody bothers you,

376
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,151
you let me know, okay?

377
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,853
If you have a question, just ask the teacher

378
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:49,887
or raise your hand.

379
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,690
Teacher: Mrs. Harris, it's okay to feel nervous.

380
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,592
It's the first day of kindergarten.

381
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,862
Matthew's going to be just fine.

382
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:00,065
Sydney: Have fun, okay?

383
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,267
(knock on door)

384
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,936
(door opens)

385
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:17,249
(car passes by)

386
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:22,587
(music playing)

387
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:38,370
(paper tearing)

388
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,150
Corey: That's one weird-ass chick, Syd.

389
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,324
(dramatic music)

390
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,661
(metal clinking)

391
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,549
(knocking)

392
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:30,487
Sydney: Hey.

393
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:30,989
Jane: Hey.

394
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:31,756
Sydney: Can we talk?

395
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:32,590
Jane: Yeah.

396
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,191
Sydney: No, I don't have much time.

397
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:35,760
Come here.

398
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,395
Jane: Are you okay?

399
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:38,630
Sydney: Matt's across the street sleeping,

400
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,563
and Corey's out of town.

401
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,232
Come here.

402
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,268
Jane: My God, you're worrying me.

403
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:45,370
(panting)

404
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,572
Sydney: You're going to think I'm completely crazy.

405
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,541
Jane: Yeah, maybe.

406
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,245
Just, I don't know, say what you want to say.

407
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:54,879
(sighs)

408
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:58,549
Sydney: I don't think I can.

409
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,118
Jane: Try me.

410
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,554
(clears throat)

411
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:07,358
Sydney: Sorry, I've wanted to ...

412
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:08,392
(sighs)

413
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,728
Fuck, Jane, I've wanted to kiss you

414
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:14,833
since the first day that I met you.

415
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:25,176
(water running)

416
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,911
(whispers) Come on.

417
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,622
What? Why haven't you said anything yet?

418
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,558
Jane: Well, what was I supposed to say?

419
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:44,295
It's not like I can tell you what you want or decide for you.

420
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:46,598
Sydney: I can't do this.

421
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,999
I could lose everything.

422
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,867
Jane: I think the universe has a way

423
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,402
of balancing everything out,

424
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,338
and if you want something, you should go for it.

425
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,774
Sydney: You know, I tried to stop this from happening.

426
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:00,144
I did. I prayed, and nothing.

427
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:01,612
(sighs)

428
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:04,115
I just don't, I don't get it.

429
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,618
(sighs)

430
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,252
You know, God shows us all these things

431
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,788
that we can't have and we can't touch,

432
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,456
and then He wants us to pray to Him

433
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,659
for strength not to want those things?

434
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,728
Jane: I think maybe some things

435
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,297
aren't meant to be stopped.

436
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:25,236
(birds chirping)

437
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,178
(sirens)

438
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:43,821
(military bugles)

439
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:47,057
Duncan: Man, as long as I can still have sex with my wife,

440
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:48,425
then I'm good to go.

441
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,094
(chuckles)

442
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,865
Man, I could be deaf and blind,

443
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,868
have both my arms and legs blown off,

444
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,671
and I'd still be happy with just my dick.

445
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,707
(laughs)

446
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,610
(sighs)

447
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,881
Man, you saved my life.

448
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:14,652
Corey: I didn't do shit, man.

449
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:17,422
You only got one leg.

450
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,324
Duncan: But I gotta chance to be happy.

451
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:23,327
I was an ungrateful piece of shit before.

452
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,965
Life's too short to spend it being unhappy.

453
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:27,831
(laughs)

454
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:33,037
You're a fuckin' hero, dude, I'm free!

455
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:40,144
You know what your problem is?

456
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:41,712
You had this picture in your head of what it'd be like

457
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:44,315
to save somebody, how they could walk,

458
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:47,385
or they could run,

459
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,386
but you can't write the ending

460
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,789
to somebody else's life, man.

461
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,026
It ain't up to you.

462
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,397
(rumbling noise)

463
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,009
(clanking noise)

464
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:24,522
Corey: You lying son-of-a-bitch.

465
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:29,493
Looks like your back doesn't hurt you after all.

466
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:32,197
Workman's comp, my ass.

467
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,312
(birds chirping)

468
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,347
Geri: Hey!

469
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,252
(sighs)

470
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:57,688
Sydney: You're the woman from over there.

471
00:30:57,721 --> 00:31:00,124
You always make it a habit to water your plants at night?

472
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,726
Geri: Shit has to grow.

473
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,494
You're obviously not from around here.

474
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:06,531
People do all kinds of shit at night in Arizona.

475
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,600
Geri: Geri Woods.

476
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,837
Short for Geraldine, but your ass can call me Geri.

477
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:19,110
Sydney: Sydney, and your ass can call me Sydney.

478
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,012
Yeah, see you around.

479
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,248
Geri: You sure you really want to do that?

480
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,683
Sydney: And what is it that I'm doing?

481
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,921
Geri: Settin' yourself up to fail, big time.

482
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:30,721
(scoffs)

483
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,590
Sydney: I'm sorry. Do you know me?

484
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:35,126
Geri: No, I don't, which is pretty fuckin' weird

485
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,762
becuase I still know you're settin' yourself up to fail.

486
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,863
Sydney: You know what?

487
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,731
I'm just bringing donuts to my friend.

488
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:42,800
Geri: And I'm fuckin' Miss America.

489
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,035
Sydney: You know, who do you think you are?

490
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:44,902
Geri: Whoa, look.

491
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:46,804
Don't get your panties all in a bunch.

492
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,173
I'm just tryin' to help you out.

493
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,143
Hey.

494
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,748
You'll figure it out.

495
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:02,854
(birds chirping)

496
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:05,422
(sighs)

497
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,724
Jane: Hey!

498
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:10,361
Sydney: Hey, I ...

499
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:13,964
I was just coming to get Matt.

500
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,567
Jane: Yeah, the boys are playing.

501
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,269
Sydney: Here, I brought you these.

502
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,337
Jane: Thanks.

503
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,271
You okay? You wanna come in?

504
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:21,339
Sydney: No I'm just ...

505
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,940
I'll come get him later.

506
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,377
Jane: Hey, what if this was your one moment

507
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,445
to actually be happy?

508
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,815
Wouldn't you want to see what it looks like?

509
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:33,451
(sighs)

510
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:45,963
Sydney: Hey, Tony.

511
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:47,431
Come here, hon.

512
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,199
Can you get your brother's stuff together?

513
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,503
Your mom's going to be here soon.

514
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:53,570
Thanks, hon.

515
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,239
Tony: Welcome.

516
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:05,816
Corey: This friend of yours, Jane,

517
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:11,021
seems interesting.

518
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,224
So, she had an interview this morning?

519
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,224
(papers rustling)

520
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,093
Sydney: Yeah.

521
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,094
Corey: Then what's she been doing for money

522
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,529
this whole time?

523
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:19,564
Sydney: She's ...

524
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,265
I think she's been working as a spiritual healer,

525
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,835
but that was a long time ago.

526
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:30,107
Corey: Really? Equipped with a crystal ball?

527
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,142
(scoffs)

528
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,676
Sydney: No, Corey.

529
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,846
She's been on disability.

530
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,849
You know, she's had a rough childhood.

531
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:41,419
Maybe you should give her a break.

532
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,956
Corey: A burn victim on disability?

533
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:47,892
Sounds like a claimant to me.

534
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,663
Sydney: You know, not everybody's cheating.

535
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,866
(knocking)

536
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,376
Jane: Hey.

537
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:11,482
Thanks for watchin' the babes.

538
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:13,851
That's awesome of you.

539
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,623
Corey: My wife's the one with the big heart.

540
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,792
(scoffs)

541
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,630
Jane: Aww.

542
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:29,734
Corey: We met overseas.

543
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,170
High school sweethearts.

544
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,541
Daddy's little girl never saw me coming.

545
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,677
Sydney: Yeah, Corey was in the Marines at the time,

546
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,082
and I was a military brat.

547
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:47,618
He proposed to me three days after

548
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,886
my high school graduation.

549
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,088
Jane: Wow.

550
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,158
Sydney: Yeah. God, my parents flipped.

551
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,360
Jane: Well, that's really young.

552
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,764
I mean, you shouldn't stop fishing on your first bite,

553
00:35:00,797 --> 00:35:04,201
and, Corey, I mean, robbin' the cradle just a little bit,

554
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,970
don't you think?

555
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,572
Just a little bit?

556
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,208
I'm just kidding.

557
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:21,252
Sydney: I'm a little nervous.

558
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,922
Jane: Ehh, it's only 'cause it's your first time.

559
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:27,725
(laughs)

560
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,693
Sydney: Want a bite?

561
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,728
Jane: No, I'm good.

562
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,596
Sydney: Are you sure?

563
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,365
Jane: Okay, one little one.

564
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,734
(laughs)

565
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:38,803
Sydney: So do you believe in this whole

566
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,738
forbidden fruit thing?

567
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,442
Jane: Oh, no. I don't think about that.

568
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:47,811
Sydney: What do you think about?

569
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:48,779
Jane: I don't know.

570
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,315
I think people should do what they want to do,

571
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:52,816
be who they want to be,

572
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,520
as long as they follow Karma, you know?

573
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,388
Sydney: Ready?

574
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,457
Jane: Mm-hmm.

575
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,026
(car doors open)

576
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:07,298
(rock music)

577
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:10,601
(door shuts)

578
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,371
Jane: Hi. We want a new look.

579
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:15,438
(sighs)

580
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:19,076
Sydney: Yeah, something really small and tasteful,

581
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:20,211
please.

582
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,893
Jane: Hmm. Awesome.

583
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:40,231
(dramatic music)

584
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,339
Doctor: We'll get you back here in 8 weeks,

585
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,541
at which point we'll start you on

586
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:53,477
the Synthroid medication, which is just a tiny little pill

587
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,447
you'll take once a day for the rest of your life.

588
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,247
Sydney: Wait, I'm sorry.

589
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,083
Did you just say the rest of my life?

590
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,518
Doctor: Mrs. Harris, after the radioiodine treatment

591
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,453
runs its course, you'll no longer have a thyroid,

592
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:04,921
but you still need the TSH to-

593
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:07,191
Sydney: But wait, the cancer's gone, right?

594
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,759
Doctor: The cancer is in your thyroid.

595
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,160
We need to destroy the thyroid

596
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,096
in order to destroy the cancer.

597
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,230
You'll be fine.

598
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,766
That tiny little pill is what's going to keep you alive.

599
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:16,901
Sydney: All right.

600
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,970
I'll pay you the remaining 200 in a couple weeks, okay?

601
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,572
Doctor: Great. Thanks.

602
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,307
Sydney: See ya.

603
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,380
Hey, babe.

604
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:35,786
Hey, guys. You ready?

605
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:38,856
Let's grab your stuff. Let's go.

606
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,124
(shaking pill bottle)

607
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,421
(scrubbing sounds)

608
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,001
Hey.

609
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,121
Corey: Your hands don't tremble anymore.

610
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,827
Sydney: Not as long as I stay on my medication.

611
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,197
Corey: It was all worth the money then.

612
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:56,834
Sydney: I'm going to work.

613
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,938
Jane has a friend who needs help babysitting,

614
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,075
so I figured the extra cash would be good.

615
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,146
Corey: What, you miss Matt being at home or something?

616
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,549
Sydney: Maybe a little.

617
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,286
Heee-ya!

618
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,188
All right, you're too heavy. Go!

619
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:22,493
(panting)

620
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,396
Corey: Careful!

621
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:33,237
I got a week coming up in Colorado.

622
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,807
(sighs)

623
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,911
Sydney: Why can't you just be still?

624
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,447
Corey: Because we need the money.

625
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,682
I got the promotion, you know,

626
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,852
and it requires more travel.

627
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,754
Sydney: I need you here.

628
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:52,123
Corey: Matt?

629
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,994
You think I like this?

630
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,296
Sydney: Yeah, actually, I do.

631
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,398
You know, Corey, all you need is an S on your chest

632
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,634
and a fucking red cape, you know?

633
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:09,106
(dramatic music)

634
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:34,632
(panting)

635
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,734
Shit.

636
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,344
I'd like you to come to church with me on Saturday,

637
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,546
if you want.

638
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,347
(laughs)

639
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:52,349
Jane: You're kidding, right?

640
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:53,551
(laughs)

641
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,584
No, no, no, no.

642
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,887
I don't do the whole organized religion thing.

643
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,556
Sydney: I thought you were really into God.

644
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:03,928
Jane: Yeah, I'm spiritual, not religious.

645
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:11,268
How's that whole babysitting thing coming?

646
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:12,268
Sydney: Oh, it's coming.

647
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:13,704
It's just extra cash right now,

648
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,640
but I think the baby's starting to like me.

649
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:19,109
Jane: Aww, what's not to like?

650
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:23,080
I like that shirt too.

651
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,314
Sydney: Oh, this?

652
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:27,117
I wear it every day. It's just my writing shirt.

653
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,719
Jane: I know.

654
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,620
What is it, like some mojo for you?

655
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,321
Good luck?

656
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:32,522
(laughs)

657
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,259
Sydney: No, I don't believe in good luck.

658
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,761
It just gets me in my zone, you know?

659
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,329
Jane: I know.

660
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,663
I fucked a writer in college.

661
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:43,300
He was always in his head.

662
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:43,968
Sydney: I don't know.

663
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,836
Maybe you were just his muse.

664
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,939
Just needed somebody special for inspiration.

665
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:51,842
Jane: I don't think he felt that way.

666
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,176
Sydney: Well, his loss.

667
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,779
Jane: It was pretty much only about sex.

668
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:57,547
Well, with all the fucking bastards,

669
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,616
it's all about sex.

670
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,585
I mean, I actually don't think I've ever

671
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:06,189
made love to anyone in my entire life.

672
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:08,158
Sydney: What about your husband?

673
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:11,729
Jane: Jimmy?

674
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,465
Mm. Calls every morning.

675
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,301
He writes letters,

676
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,270
but the one thing that I really needed from him,

677
00:42:20,303 --> 00:42:23,607
he just couldn't get it.

678
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,077
Boys, lunch is almost ready.

679
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,280
I mean, we just ...

680
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,417
The only reason we got married is 'cause I got pregnant.

681
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,585
Sydney: Do you miss him?

682
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,288
Jane: I don't want to talk about him anymore.

683
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,597
(glass breaking)

684
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:53,803
Matt: Mom, what's wrong with Jane?

685
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,773
Tony: Mommy, what's wrong?

686
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,873
Sydney: Don't worry about it guys, okay?

687
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:59,410
Go on back. Give her a minute.

688
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:06,850
(crying)

689
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:08,619
Jane: I didn't sign up for this.

690
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,254
I did not sign up for this,

691
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,890
and it's always me picking up the slack!

692
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,826
It's always me, just me!

693
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:23,000
(crying)

694
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,603
(baskeball swishes in hoop)

695
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:28,038
(ball bouncing)

696
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,738
Sydney: Come on!

697
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:31,341
See if you can beat your mom.

698
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:32,109
Whatcha got?

699
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,277
Come on!

700
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,616
Come on, little man. Whatcha got?

701
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:43,052
Oh, what's that? Traveling!

702
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:45,055
Matt: Ahh!

703
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:47,791
(ball bouncing)

704
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:48,759
Sydney: Come on!

705
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,894
Matt: Look, Mommy!

706
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:52,563
There's Jane and Tony!

707
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,732
Tony: Hi, Matt!

708
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,467
Sydney: Hey, Bud.

709
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,468
Jane: Hey, you!

710
00:43:58,501 --> 00:43:59,636
Sydney: Hey.

711
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:01,338
Hey, buddy! (baby giggles)

712
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,306
Jane: I didn't know you played ball.

713
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:02,973
(baby giggling)

714
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:04,074
Sydney: Oh, it's not a big deal.

715
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:05,108
I just used to play back in high school.

716
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,076
Jane: You know what?

717
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:08,445
Tony just tried out for his team at school.

718
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,546
Could use some help.

719
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:10,313
(laughs)

720
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:11,648
I don't know if you're up for it.

721
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,716
Sydney: Sure.

722
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,751
Tony: Sydney, can you help me dribble

723
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:15,953
under my legs, please?

724
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:16,753
(laughs)

725
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:19,556
Syndey: Sure, come on.

726
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,258
What's the matter? You can't do it, huh?

727
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,159
No, show me how you do it first.

728
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:25,963
Then I'll show you want to do.

729
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,566
(music playing on TV)

730
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,609
(click, music stops)

731
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,012
(Jane giggles)

732
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:46,216
Sydney: So did all three fall asleep in your room?

733
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:48,385
Jane: Yep, out like lights.

734
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,621
(yawns)

735
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,757
That move was actually pretty good.

736
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,557
Sydney: Yeah.

737
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,227
Jane: Was the script well-written?

738
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,461
(laughs)

739
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,631
Sydney: Yeah, it was okay.

740
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:02,666
(yawns)

741
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,168
Jane: It's really late.

742
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:06,370
Sydney: Yeah, I'm gonna get going.

743
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,205
Are you okay with Matt staying here?

744
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,572
Jane: Yeah.

745
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,707
Sydney: Okay.

746
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,444
Jane: But you don't look like you want to go.

747
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:16,846
Sydney: No, I have to go.

748
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,749
I'm going.

749
00:45:19,816 --> 00:45:22,920
Jane: Okay, fine. Leave.

750
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,588
You don't have to leave.

751
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,489
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

752
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:30,994
Sydney: Why? You want me to stay?

753
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,829
Jane: Yeah.

754
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:34,198
Sydney: Why?

755
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,468
(kiss)

756
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,071
Jane: I'm sorry.

757
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:41,705
Sorry.

758
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,207
Sydney: No.

759
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:56,886
(kissing)

760
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:57,787
(click)

761
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,890
(gasps)

762
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,157
Jane: Oh, my God.

763
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,359
Sydney: What?

764
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:04,528
Matt: Mommy?

765
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,929
Sydney: Hey, sweetheart.

766
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,664
What's wrong?

767
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:10,033
Matt: Can I go back to sleep on you, Mommy?

768
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:12,536
Sydney: Yeah, come here, babe.

769
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,811
Thanks.

770
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:24,147
I think we're going to get going.

771
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,948
Jane: You don't have to.

772
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:25,649
You can stay.

773
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,016
I mean, he's comfortable.

774
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,520
He might be up all night if you leave.

775
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:34,391
(quietly) He didn't see a thing.

776
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,325
(sighs)

777
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:36,760
Sydney: Whether he saw something or not

778
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:39,195
doesn't change the fact that it happened.

779
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,932
Jane: Hey, things happen.

780
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:46,236
(sighs)

781
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:48,538
Okay, well, you guys can sleep out here.

782
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,340
Feel free.

783
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:53,277
Good night.

784
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:09,293
(church music in Latin)

785
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,967
Sydney: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

786
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,572
Priest: How long as it been since your last confession?

787
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,309
Sydney: Couple years, maybe.

788
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,477
Priest: Go on.

789
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:29,279
(chuckles)

790
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,114
Sydney: It's funny 'cause I used to come once a month

791
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:32,082
when I was a little girl,

792
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,586
but that's when my mother made me.

793
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,389
Let's see.

794
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:44,127
I got angry with my son a few times for not listening,

795
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,764
and I'm angry with my husband a lot,

796
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,599
and I'm just, I'm pissed.

797
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,668
(sighs)

798
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:57,107
Priest: Is that all, or is there much more?

799
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:04,114
Sydney: I may have committed adultery,

800
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,048
and I don't know.

801
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:06,149
Maybe it was adultery.

802
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:11,855
I just, for one split second, it just felt so right.

803
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,624
Priest: These are not the types of situations

804
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:16,793
that the church handles.

805
00:48:16,826 --> 00:48:18,595
I can give you the name and number

806
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:21,097
of a good marriage counselor.

807
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,267
Sydney: But Father, I came to you for help!

808
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,102
Priest: I'm sorry.

809
00:48:26,135 --> 00:48:29,706
That's the best that I can do for you.

810
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:34,378
(church music continues)

811
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,562
(glass breaking)

812
00:49:09,178 --> 00:49:11,514
Jane: Yes. Yeah, the bubble.

813
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:12,382
John: Ba-ba.

814
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,484
Jane: Bubble.

815
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,253
(baby whines)

816
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,254
Jane: It isn't?

817
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,822
It is a bubble?

818
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:23,260
(baby cries)

819
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:32,068
So, are you going to tell me what this sad little act

820
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,369
is all about?

821
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:34,471
Tony: No.

822
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,605
(laughs)

823
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,039
Jane: Are you sure?

824
00:49:37,073 --> 00:49:38,175
Tony: Yep.

825
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,477
Jane: Come on, baby. Just tell me what's wrong.

826
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,680
Tony: Why can't Sydney play basketball

827
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,948
with me today?

828
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:49,920
She knows some cool moves, just like Dad used to.

829
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,388
Jane: Yeah, she does.

830
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,824
you're right.

831
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,526
You know, Sydney's really busy.

832
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,428
she's got lots of stuff to do.

833
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,963
Tony: Like what?

834
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:01,865
Jane: Well, she's got a family.

835
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:02,399
(baby coos)

836
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,000
Jane: Hi, baby.

837
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,836
Tony: Aren't we her family?

838
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,606
Jane: Yeah, sweet, but it's different.

839
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:16,446
Tony: Mommy, sometimes I don't miss Daddy.

840
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:19,883
(kiss)

841
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,220
Jane: I know. I know.

842
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,622
You know what?

843
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,824
Tony: What?

844
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:29,759
Jane: I know how to play basketball too.

845
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:30,760
Tony: No, you don't.

846
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:32,395
(laughs)

847
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,998
Jane: Okay, Sydney is much better than I am.

848
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,399
(laughs)

849
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,968
You're right.

850
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:44,274
(music playing)

851
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,447
Matt: Mommy, do you love Daddy?

852
00:50:51,414 --> 00:50:53,984
Sydney: Of course, sweetheart, why?

853
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,918
Matt: Well, you and Daddy don't kiss

854
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:58,087
like the men and women on TV.

855
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,491
You don't even hug each other.

856
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:04,227
Sydney: Yeah, I guess we don't, huh?

857
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,094
Well, listen.

858
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,497
This has nothing to do with you, okay?

859
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,633
Matt: Okay.

860
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,635
Sydney: Hey, guess what.

861
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,205
I got you something!

862
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,239
(blasting sounds)

863
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:17,207
Matt: Cool!

864
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,409
Sydney: Cool. I know you always wanted

865
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,277
to go to the moon, so I just wanted you to know

866
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,047
that you can, and it's possible.

867
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,282
Okay?

868
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,551
So, you never really told me

869
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,152
why do you want to go to the moon?

870
00:51:29,185 --> 00:51:31,721
Matt: Because you can see everything from there,

871
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,056
the whole world!

872
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,524
Sydney: Everything, huh?

873
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,159
The whole world?

874
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,027
You can? How do you know?

875
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,495
You've never been, huh?

876
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:43,033
(laughing)

877
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:48,304
(music playing)

878
00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:50,774
Sydney: Matt, be careful!

879
00:51:56,645 --> 00:51:59,983
Corey: What's going with you?

880
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,084
I'm gone a few days, and-

881
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,787
Sydney: I'd hardly call weeks at a time a few days.

882
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,797
Corey: (scoffs) Fuck.

883
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:18,101
Matt: Daddy, watch me go down the slide!

884
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:31,448
Corey: Let's get you to a doctor, Syd.

885
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,049
See if the cancer's spread.

886
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:35,618
Sydney: For what? I'm fine.

887
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:38,088
I feel good.

888
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,463
Corey: Tell me what you want for your birthday.

889
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,300
Sydney: I hadn't even really thought about it.

890
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:52,903
Corey: All right.

891
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:58,407
Why don't we go out to a nice restaurant?

892
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,510
We can have a nice dinner.

893
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:05,247
Maybe catch a movie afterwards.

894
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:09,118
Maybe Jane can watch Matt.

895
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:13,156
(phone rings)

896
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,959
It's Corey.

897
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,628
Yeah. Hey, Bill.

898
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,666
Sure.

899
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:26,235
Yup, I was actually hoping that could

900
00:53:26,268 --> 00:53:28,204
wait a couple of weeks.

901
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:28,905
It's,

902
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,840
it's my wife's birthday.

903
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:38,782
Of course. I understand.

904
00:53:42,084 --> 00:53:43,620
(sighs)

905
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:56,433
(music)

906
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,404
(knocking)

907
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:07,510
(door creaks open)

908
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:15,118
Jane: Corey out of town again?

909
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,152
Sydney: No, he's here.

910
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,554
He's just over there hanging with Matt.

911
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,926
Jane: You know, Tony's been asking about you.

912
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,527
Sydney: Really?

913
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,529
Jane: Yeah. He's really starting to like you.

914
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,464
Sydney: I like you-

915
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:32,168
him, all of you.

916
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:34,804
I like all of you too.

917
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,241
Jane: Yeah, well.

918
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,543
You should go be with your family then.

919
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:41,544
Be with your husband.

920
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:44,047
You've, you've got a family.

921
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,149
Sydney: Does that make me a bad person

922
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,485
that I want to be with you right now?

923
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:01,831
Sydney: So, where are the boys?

924
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,001
Jane: Taking a nap.

925
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,637
Sydney: Listen ...

926
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:08,271
Jane: Sydney ...

927
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,373
Sydney: I was at the store,

928
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:15,377
and all I could do was smell your perfume.

929
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:15,912
Mm.

930
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:18,747
I was hoping you'd be around the next aisle.

931
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:19,649
Jane: Sydney, don't. Just-

932
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:24,421
Sydney: I was disappointed, so I'm here.

933
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:37,267
(kissing)

934
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:43,472
(sighs)

935
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:45,575
Jane: I want you to go.

936
00:55:46,475 --> 00:55:49,779
Go before I get used to this.

937
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:52,381
(door opens)

938
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,117
I mean it.

939
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:55,385
(scoffs)

940
00:55:55,418 --> 00:56:00,089
(music playing)

941
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,291
(door closes)

942
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:23,480
(paper rustlling)

943
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:41,497
Sydney: Hey, bud. You wanna do some homework?

944
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,199
(laughs)

945
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:44,567
Come on.

946
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:46,135
Put this one away.

947
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,270
Let's go.

948
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,405
(clears throat)

949
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:50,506
Ready?

950
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,774
First one.

951
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:53,143
Matt: five.

952
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,244
Sydney: Oh, smartie pants, are we?

953
00:56:55,277 --> 00:56:56,745
How about a little harder one?

954
00:56:56,779 --> 00:56:57,714
Matt: Two.

955
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,214
(laughs)

956
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,050
Sydney: Can you let me get it out of the box?

957
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,286
All right, you ready?

958
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:05,755
Matt: 12.

959
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:07,723
Sydney: Aww, I gotcha on that one.

960
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:14,831
(vacuum humming)

961
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,904
Excuse me.

962
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:33,316
Corey: Our home doesn't have to be perfect.

963
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,888
(vacuum motors slows to a stop)

964
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:43,293
Sydney: Yeah, well maybe it does to me.

965
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,402
(water running)

966
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,276
(water stops running)

967
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:11,287
Corey: You hear back from any of the, you're agent people?

968
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,588
Sydney: Yeah.

969
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,657
Five rejections.

970
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,493
Corey: What?

971
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:24,367
Sydney: I said five rejections, okay?

972
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,768
I'm no farther along now

973
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:27,803
than when I started 5 years ago.

974
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,505
Are you happy?

975
00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:30,306
There's just one problem,

976
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,610
I don't know how to be anybody else.

977
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,482
Corey: Oh.

978
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,851
Sydney: Oh? Oh?

979
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:43,652
(sighs)

980
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,556
Gee, thanks for the words of encouragement.

981
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,424
Corey: What do you want me to do?

982
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:50,125
I can't make 'em want your scripts.

983
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,029
Sydney: I'm not happy with you.

984
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:59,002
Shit, I didn't mean that.

985
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,841
(sighs)

986
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:13,449
Corey: Sure, you did.

987
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:15,752
Sydney: No, Corey, wait.

988
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:17,820
Sydney: Shit.

989
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:24,894
Jane: Corey does know he's missing out

990
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:26,829
on your birthday, right?

991
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:28,998
Volunteering to work on a Saturday?

992
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:30,766
That's ridiculous.

993
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,768
Sydney: He got called out of town, you know?

994
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:35,371
They can call him any day of the week.

995
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:42,312
Jane: I got you something.

996
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,048
Stay.

997
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,717
Sydney: You didn't have to do that.

998
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,489
Jane: Shut up, just open it.

999
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,631
(baby talking)

1000
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,900
Sydney: I love it.

1001
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:04,633
Jane: Yeah?

1002
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:05,602
Sydney: Thank you.

1003
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,004
Jane: You're welcome.

1004
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,238
Tony: Now, pull it back,

1005
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,607
pull it back.

1006
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,109
Don't do that.

1007
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,311
They're not home yet.

1008
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:20,917
(crunching)

1009
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:28,524
(kids continue playing)

1010
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:36,232
(music: Feels Like Home)

1011
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,104
(sung) Hey there, friend of mine.

1012
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:44,072
(sung) I hope you don't mind

1013
01:00:44,106 --> 01:00:47,743
(sung) if I, get a little closer to you

1014
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:50,279
(sung) move up a little closer to you.

1015
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,515
(sung) Hey there, friend of mine.

1016
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,685
(sung) I used to live up the street from you.

1017
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,520
(sung) Can I move a little closer,

1018
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,991
(sung) be a little closer to you.

1019
01:01:02,024 --> 01:01:06,462
(sung) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:10,432
(sung) It's easier to spell it out like this.

1021
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:11,667
(sung) You better believe me,

1022
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,472
(sung) and it's easier to put it like that.

1023
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:20,776
(sung) It's easier to throw out it like this.

1024
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:23,846
(sung) Yeah, you better believe me, dear.

1025
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,615
(sung) You better believe me, dear.

1026
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:26,582
(heavy breathing)

1027
01:01:26,615 --> 01:01:28,083
(sung) You better believe me.

1028
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,886
(sung) Hey there, friend of mine.

1029
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:32,889
(sung) I hope you don't mind

1030
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:36,492
(sung) if I get up on the counter,

1031
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:39,027
(sung) get a little louder.

1032
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:41,263
(sung) Hey there, friend of mine,

1033
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,300
(sung) you just take your good sweet time,

1034
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,902
(sung) 'cause if we go any faster,

1035
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,806
(sung) this could end up a disaster in time.

1036
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:52,975
(sung) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:54,377
(laughs)

1038
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,447
(sung) It's easier to spell it out like this.

1039
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,615
(sung) You better believe me,

1040
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:04,854
(sung) and it's easier to put it like that.

1041
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,657
(sung) It's easier to throw it out like this.

1042
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,527
(sung) Yeah, you better believe me dear.

1043
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,796
(sung) You better believe me dear.

1044
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,065
(sung) Yeah, you better believe me.

1045
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:20,402
(sung) Don't you stay with me because you feel safe.

1046
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:26,775
(sung) And don't you stay with me because you're bored.

1047
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,212
(sung) Don't you stay with me because your heart aches,

1048
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:32,915
(sung) and you don't want to be alone.

1049
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:35,584
(sung) No, you don't wanna be alone.

1050
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,487
(sung) I'll stay if I feel like home.

1051
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,657
(kissing)

1052
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,061
(sung) It feels like home.

1053
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,730
(heavy breathing)

1054
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:51,133
(sung) It's easier to spell it out like this.

1055
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:53,268
(sung) Hey, you better believe me,

1056
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:58,174
(sung) and it's easier to put it like that.

1057
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,677
(sung) It's easier to throw it out like this.

1058
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,613
(sung) Yeah, you better believe me, dear.

1059
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:07,383
(sung) You better believe me, dear.

1060
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,820
(sung) You better believe me.

1061
01:03:15,257 --> 01:03:16,592
Jane: What are you doing?

1062
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,994
Sydney: Hey, nothing.

1063
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,730
How'd you sleep?

1064
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:24,200
Jane: Like I had five orgasms.

1065
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:29,205
No wonder Corey wants to fuck you all the time.

1066
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:31,607
What?

1067
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,177
Sydney: Why does it always have to be 'fuck'?

1068
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,146
Why can't it be ...

1069
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:42,718
Jane: What? Like making love?

1070
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,421
I mean, I don't know, because fuck is fuck.

1071
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,588
I mean it's just feelingless.

1072
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:48,524
Sydney: It's meaningless.

1073
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:50,325
Jane: No, that's not what I meant.

1074
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:53,028
I would never say that about you.

1075
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:53,996
Sydney: Yeah, but.

1076
01:03:54,029 --> 01:03:54,964
(sighs)

1077
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:01,804
(kiss)

1078
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,909
I love you.

1079
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,081
Jane: What are you writing?

1080
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,450
Sydney: Wouldn't you like to know?

1081
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:18,054
Jane: Yes, I would.

1082
01:04:19,254 --> 01:04:21,524
(laughs)

1083
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:39,609
Is this about me? A poem?

1084
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,811
Sydney: Yeah.

1085
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,114
Aww.

1086
01:04:48,283 --> 01:04:50,686
Do you wanna know how I got burnt?

1087
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,789
Sydney: If you want to tell me.

1088
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:57,994
(sighs)

1089
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:04,066
Jane: Well, I never knew my dad,

1090
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:10,973
and my mom left me at a church when I was almost 4.

1091
01:05:11,006 --> 01:05:13,976
She left me with Ned.

1092
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:16,178
Ned was my teddy bear.

1093
01:05:16,211 --> 01:05:18,547
She said if I took really good care of Ned,

1094
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,917
that she'd come back for me.

1095
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,552
She never came back,

1096
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:29,124
but, yeah, I made sure to take care of Ned,

1097
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:33,429
and my foster parents who lived in New Mexico

1098
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:36,565
and had like 10 children including me

1099
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:37,933
were crazy,

1100
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,169
and the summer before my kindergarten year,

1101
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,906
yeah, I think that's when it was,

1102
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:46,408
their house caught on fire,

1103
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:49,111
and everyone was rushing out,

1104
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,013
and I remember all I could think about

1105
01:05:51,046 --> 01:05:52,748
was saving my teddy bear

1106
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:56,518
because I wanted to see my mom again.

1107
01:05:56,552 --> 01:06:00,556
So, I ran back to my room,

1108
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,757
and I knew just where he was at,

1109
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,992
and I opened the door,

1110
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:07,262
and the room was on fire,

1111
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,198
and all I could do was hold on to the door sill

1112
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,633
with my right hand,

1113
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,103
and I reached in and grabbed Ned with my left,

1114
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:17,673
and he should have been right there,

1115
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:22,411
but he wasn't, and I didn't save the bear.

1116
01:06:23,778 --> 01:06:26,882
And I never saw my mom again.

1117
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:33,856
Then, in 6th grade, I got into writing.

1118
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,558
That's really when I started writing

1119
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,759
all my poetry and stuff,

1120
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,396
all the pent-up feelings and issues that I had

1121
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:42,465
with my mom being gone,

1122
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:46,869
and this stupid little teddy bear.

1123
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:51,607
I just wrote about, and wrote, and wrote, and wrote.

1124
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,375
And it was during a time when I was

1125
01:06:53,408 --> 01:06:55,611
getting made fun of so much,

1126
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:59,482
and I was so self-conscious about it all.

1127
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:05,421
Just, yeah.

1128
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,527
Sydney: I think you're beautiful.

1129
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:16,165
Jane: (laughs) Really?

1130
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:22,104
(kiss)

1131
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:29,378
(dance music)

1132
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,364
Bartender: What'll you have?

1133
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,566
Sydney: Just a juice please.

1134
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,435
Bartender: Is this your first time in a club?

1135
01:07:53,468 --> 01:07:55,837
Sydney: Am I that transparent?

1136
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,706
Bartender: So, which one of these guys is you

1137
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,542
and your friend fighting over?

1138
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,278
Is she dancing with him right now?

1139
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:07,283
Sydney: No, I'm not here for a guy.

1140
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:11,687
Jane: I need a cold one!

1141
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,855
Bartender: You got it.

1142
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,227
Come out here!

1143
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,530
Come on.

1144
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,167
Sydney: Come on, we're in public.

1145
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,901
Jane: Oh, what?

1146
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:26,902
You can fuck me in my house,

1147
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:29,271
but you can't hold my hand?

1148
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:30,005
(laughs)

1149
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:31,874
Sydney: No, I just ...

1150
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:46,589
(slow dance music)

1151
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:55,130
Sydney: Am I hurting you?

1152
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:56,098
Jane: No.

1153
01:08:57,132 --> 01:08:59,001
That's the first time a girl's asked me that.

1154
01:09:20,355 --> 01:09:22,424
(laughing)

1155
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:23,358
Sydney: Oh, my God, Jane.

1156
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:25,860
This is our first date.

1157
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:27,096
(laughing)

1158
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,263
Jane: Oh, my God. It is.

1159
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:29,331
This is our first date.

1160
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:30,799
Happy anniversary.

1161
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,567
(laughing)

1162
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,001
Sydney: Happy anniversa-

1163
01:09:33,034 --> 01:09:34,703
(glass clinking) Wait,

1164
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:36,105
don't you have to be together like a year

1165
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,040
before you can say that?

1166
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,642
Jane: I don't care. Happy fucking anniversary anyway.

1167
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:41,410
(laughs)

1168
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,679
give me a kiss!

1169
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:44,780
(laughs)

1170
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:45,880
Sydney: No!

1171
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:47,249
(laughing)

1172
01:09:47,282 --> 01:09:48,650
Jane: There's nobody here anymore.

1173
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:51,620
Geri: Looks like you ladies need a ride home.

1174
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:52,454
Sydney: What?

1175
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:57,526
(dramatic music)

1176
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:21,150
(paper crinkling)

1177
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:28,324
Corey: You know what that is?

1178
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:30,859
(sighs)

1179
01:10:32,927 --> 01:10:34,095
Sydney: What are you trying to get me to do

1180
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,931
or say, Corey?

1181
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,070
Corey: To, to remember.

1182
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:44,807
I want you to remember.

1183
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:50,112
A friend of mine once told me

1184
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:55,417
to keep pictures of things you want out of life,

1185
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:58,487
and focus on it until it becomes real.

1186
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:02,958
Sydney: What do you want?

1187
01:11:03,825 --> 01:11:07,129
Corey: For you to believe in me again.

1188
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,199
Sydney: I never stopped believing in you, Corey.

1189
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,133
You're the hardest working person that I know.

1190
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,702
Corey: You don't dream anymore.

1191
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:18,006
You don't believe in the impossible like you used to.

1192
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,642
Sydney: I never stopped dreaming.

1193
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,379
I just stopped telling you 'cause you don't listen.

1194
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:31,954
(sighs)

1195
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,322
Corey: I deserve that.

1196
01:11:34,422 --> 01:11:37,459
Sydney: You know, this wasn't supposed to

1197
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,561
play out like this.

1198
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:46,302
Corey: Then you change the ending.

1199
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:50,072
I need you to remember.

1200
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:57,279
(sighs)

1201
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,583
You see that?

1202
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:07,422
That's the only family vacation we ever had.

1203
01:12:07,455 --> 01:12:10,859
I can't work for someone else the rest of my life,

1204
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,861
and I understand that now.

1205
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:17,466
I'm going to own my own business.

1206
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,803
I'm the one you have to believe in.

1207
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,640
Dream with me again.

1208
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:32,748
(suspenseful music)

1209
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:09,518
(dramatic music)

1210
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,663
Jane: She what?

1211
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,898
Corey: I woke up this morning, she was gone.

1212
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,100
(Jane laughs)

1213
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:29,637
I don't find anything funny about this, Jane.

1214
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,272
You sure you haven't seen her?

1215
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:34,209
Jane: No, I haven't.

1216
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,246
Um, excuse me.

1217
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,715
Corey: She having an affair, huh?

1218
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,117
Some fuckin' rich bastard?

1219
01:13:43,151 --> 01:13:44,085
Some pipe dreamin' artist?

1220
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,255
Some shit like that?

1221
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,355
Jane: Is that what you're worried about?

1222
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:48,624
An artist?

1223
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:49,925
God, you're ...

1224
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,361
No, no. She's not with an arist,

1225
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:54,963
and even if she was with an artist,

1226
01:13:54,996 --> 01:13:59,568
he's probably gay and can't fuck her

1227
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,503
because he's gay and he wouldn't want to fuck her.

1228
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:03,805
No, she's not here.

1229
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:06,942
Is there anything else you need?

1230
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:13,582
Shit. Fuck.

1231
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,472
(knocking)

1232
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:42,544
Jane: Oh, my God.

1233
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:43,678
Hey, buddy.

1234
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:44,880
Oh, my God, where were you?

1235
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,015
I was so worried.

1236
01:14:47,048 --> 01:14:51,086
(kissing)

1237
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,286
Sydney: Come with me.

1238
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,622
We can start our whole life over.

1239
01:14:54,655 --> 01:14:55,890
Listen, I got a little place.

1240
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,892
It's not much, but I've been waiting tables

1241
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:58,927
at this restaurant,

1242
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,028
and it's just going to have to do

1243
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:01,496
until I can sell my scripts.

1244
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,197
Jane: Wait a second.

1245
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,965
What are you talking about?

1246
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:06,134
Are you hearing yourself?

1247
01:15:07,602 --> 01:15:09,938
Sydney: I love you.

1248
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:12,941
Jane: Whoa, you're saying you want to be with me?

1249
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,209
I mean, just me?

1250
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:15,143
Sydney: Yeah.

1251
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:16,477
(kissing)

1252
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:17,579
What do you say?

1253
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,381
Come with me.

1254
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,184
Jane: Sydney, are you okay?

1255
01:15:23,217 --> 01:15:24,085
Sydney: It's okay.

1256
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:26,121
I just haven't been taking my meds,

1257
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:29,324
so don't worry.

1258
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:40,969
(suspenseful music)

1259
01:15:52,747 --> 01:15:56,318
(tapes falling)

1260
01:16:16,437 --> 01:16:19,607
(muffled conversation and laughing)

1261
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:23,579
(dramatic music)

1262
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,723
Sydney: I feel alive again, babe.

1263
01:16:35,756 --> 01:16:36,858
I feel like a little girl

1264
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:39,427
who still believes in Santa Claus and miracles.

1265
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,396
Geri: Fucking ho, ho, ho.

1266
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:46,101
(pages turning)

1267
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:50,772
(rustling papers)

1268
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,276
Sydney: Where the fuck do you keep coming from, huh?

1269
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:56,778
Geri: I'm just trying to stop your ass

1270
01:16:56,811 --> 01:16:58,647
from going down the same path that I did.

1271
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,215
Sydney: Are you kidding me?

1272
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,616
Have you looked in the mirror?

1273
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,317
You're the fucking poster child

1274
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:04,452
for the lesbian coalition.

1275
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:05,620
Geri: I admit.

1276
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:08,556
I've probably fucked enough beautiful ladies in my life,

1277
01:17:08,589 --> 01:17:09,624
but that's not the point.

1278
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:10,892
Sydney: Oh yeah? What is your point?

1279
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,394
Geri: I don't do that shit anymore.

1280
01:17:34,882 --> 01:17:36,317
Oh, come on.

1281
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,419
Yeah, I was married to a woman before.

1282
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:41,156
I did the whole falling in love thing.

1283
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:49,697
I really loved her though.

1284
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,801
We lived up in Colorado and, oh man, it was cold.

1285
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,770
Sydney: I'm sorry, did I ask you for your life story?

1286
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,240
Geri: Every morning, she'd go out to get the paper.

1287
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,175
She'd put my coat on.

1288
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:04,445
I could smell her perfume all day long.

1289
01:18:04,478 --> 01:18:06,381
Sydney: Oh, and what happened?

1290
01:18:06,414 --> 01:18:08,850
Geri: She set me free.

1291
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,786
Jane: You mean she left your ass.

1292
01:18:11,819 --> 01:18:12,854
Geri: That's irrelevant.

1293
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:13,622
(laughs)

1294
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:14,322
She left her ass.

1295
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:15,323
Geri: I left her, okay?

1296
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:18,226
Sydney: Hey!

1297
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:25,266
(flipping through pages)

1298
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,735
Geri: Something was missing from my life.

1299
01:18:27,768 --> 01:18:30,037
Couldn't put my finger on it.

1300
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:31,706
Even though I loved Carla,

1301
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,709
something was just fucking missing.

1302
01:18:34,742 --> 01:18:36,844
I came to know Jesus.

1303
01:18:36,877 --> 01:18:39,548
He kinda makes you wanna be a better person.

1304
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:42,884
(laughs)

1305
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,388
Jane: Great. Fucking Christian coalition in my backyard.

1306
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,555
Geri: I wasn't livin' right.

1307
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,924
Taking a married woman from her husband.

1308
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:50,992
Sydney: Oh, so what?

1309
01:18:51,025 --> 01:18:52,527
This is your redemption, Geri?

1310
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,528
You save me and you get even with God?

1311
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:55,863
Geri: I'm not here for me.

1312
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,933
There's a fuckin' price you pay for your lives.

1313
01:18:57,966 --> 01:18:59,300
You guys realize that?

1314
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,235
You can't serve God

1315
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:01,870
and do whatever the fuck you want.

1316
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,571
Sydney: Oh, so I'm not good enough now?

1317
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:04,773
Geri: I'm not saying that.

1318
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,507
I'm saying stop fuckin' up!

1319
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,879
(dramatic music)

1320
01:19:30,064 --> 01:19:31,833
Shit, you're married, Sydney.

1321
01:19:31,866 --> 01:19:33,301
Geri: As much as I hate to admit it,

1322
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:35,003
God actually thinks it makes sense

1323
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:36,504
for a man and woman to be together.

1324
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:39,174
I don't know why, but he does.

1325
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,776
Sydney: You've gotta be kidding me.

1326
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,813
Jane: So, you're saying you fuckin' some Joe Blow now?

1327
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:45,914
Geri: Hell, no!

1328
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,048
I'm not into men.

1329
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,283
I'm just by myself.

1330
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,186
Sydney: Oh, so you choose to be lonely.

1331
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,620
Geri: I'm not lonely!

1332
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:54,389
Me and Jesus are like this.

1333
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,957
He's all I ever need.

1334
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,792
(Sydney scoffs, Jane laughs)

1335
01:19:57,792 --> 01:19:58,893
Sydney: I'm outta here.

1336
01:19:58,926 --> 01:20:00,228
Geri: The only thing either of you wanted

1337
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:01,563
in the first place was love,

1338
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:02,864
and you don't think God is big enough

1339
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:05,400
to provide that for you, the way He wants to?

1340
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,334
Sydney: You know, I don't understand

1341
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,737
why do you care so much about me, huh?

1342
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,738
Geri: Just come to one church service with me.

1343
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:12,673
If God isn't as good as I say He is,

1344
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,609
you can call me a fuckin' liar,

1345
01:20:14,642 --> 01:20:17,312
and I'll never come around you guys again.

1346
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:20,882
Sydney: Fine. One.

1347
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:22,851
Got it? Just one.

1348
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:23,919
Geri: Deal.

1349
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:29,623
(vomiting)

1350
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:32,160
(coughing)

1351
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:35,530
(music: Breathe)

1352
01:20:57,318 --> 01:20:59,120
(sung) Breathe.

1353
01:20:59,153 --> 01:21:07,428
(sung) Feel like I just got out of jail.

1354
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:16,237
(sung) Feel like I've been let out of a cage.

1355
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:23,945
(sung) Feel like I just have arrived.

1356
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:30,084
(sung) Breathe, now is the time.

1357
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:34,122
Jane: Wow. you came back.

1358
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,257
Sydney: Of course I did.

1359
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,959
Jane: I never left.

1360
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,229
If this was your one chance to be happy,

1361
01:21:42,263 --> 01:21:45,433
wouldn't you want to see what it looks like?

1362
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:53,241
(sung) Just let me breathe.

1363
01:21:53,274 --> 01:21:59,380
(sung) I feel liberated, I feel strong.

1364
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:07,155
(sung) Breathe. God, it's been so fucking long.

1365
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:15,897
(sung) Breathe. Feel like I just have come home.

1366
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:21,202
(sung) Breathe, just let me breathe.

1367
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:22,837
(laughing)

1368
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,773
(sung) It's been too long,

1369
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:27,908
(sung) I had to leave, that's why I'm here.

1370
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:34,249
(sung) Let me breathe. Let me breathe.

1371
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,383
Sydney: Hey.

1372
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,451
Jane: Hey, baby.

1373
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,654
Sydney: What's up?

1374
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:40,888
Whatcha doin'?

1375
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,289
Jane: Wanna do one?

1376
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:43,824
Sydney: Yeah, I'd love to.

1377
01:22:43,857 --> 01:22:45,059
(sighs)

1378
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,994
These are great.

1379
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:47,895
Jane: Thank you.

1380
01:22:47,928 --> 01:22:49,531
Sydney: Aww, Basketball babe.

1381
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:50,765
(laughs)

1382
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:54,735
Jane: This one needs something, texture.

1383
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:55,903
Do you wanna do it?

1384
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:58,205
Sydney: Yeah.

1385
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:05,046
(suspenseful music)

1386
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:12,687
(sweeping)

1387
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,206
Jane: Aah!

1388
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,343
Okay, great.

1389
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:37,745
So you got her shirt back.

1390
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:40,181
What else do you want from us?

1391
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:42,283
Corey: Us?

1392
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:43,752
US!?

1393
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,820
Jane: Corey, I don't know what to ...

1394
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:50,458
Corey: Jesus Christ, you're wearing her sports bra.

1395
01:23:50,491 --> 01:23:53,027
Jane: Look, she's going to be home any minute.

1396
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,096
Just please, please.

1397
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:57,432
Corey: Home?

1398
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,137
Is your dick bigger than mine, huh?

1399
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,806
Is that why, why you're the winner?

1400
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,942
Jane: Apparently, you don't need one to win.

1401
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:08,943
Corey: Oh, fuck you!

1402
01:24:08,976 --> 01:24:10,444
FUCK you!

1403
01:24:10,477 --> 01:24:13,281
My wife was naive. You preyed on that shit.

1404
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:14,549
Jane: Naive?

1405
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:15,850
You're an arrogant bastard!

1406
01:24:15,883 --> 01:24:16,985
You just don't get it, do you?

1407
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:17,918
You don't see it.

1408
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:18,787
Corey: See what?

1409
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,421
SEE WHAT? What is it that I don't see!?

1410
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:22,490
Jane: That she's in love!

1411
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:28,096
Corey: No, no. She's not in love.

1412
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:29,297
You hear me?

1413
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,331
You're a goddam liar!

1414
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:31,866
Jane: No, fuck you, Corey.

1415
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:34,502
I'm the one who saved your wife that night in the street.

1416
01:24:34,535 --> 01:24:37,972
(thunder)

1417
01:24:39,373 --> 01:24:41,309
We were strangers before that,

1418
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,711
and I know now, and I knew right then

1419
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,513
that there are no coincidences in life,

1420
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:47,748
just fate, as it happens,

1421
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,884
and i had to see if she was gonna come back to me

1422
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,387
on her own, and she did,

1423
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,723
and she saw me for, for me.

1424
01:24:55,756 --> 01:24:57,491
Oh, my God.

1425
01:24:57,524 --> 01:24:59,027
Sydney.

1426
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:01,796
Sydney.

1427
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,898
Sydney, wait.

1428
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:05,300
Sydney, I was gonna tell you.

1429
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,269
Sydney: What are you doing?

1430
01:25:08,302 --> 01:25:10,071
Corey: I want my son.

1431
01:25:10,104 --> 01:25:11,472
Sydney: Jane, this is between Corey and I.

1432
01:25:11,505 --> 01:25:12,407
Get inside.

1433
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:16,711
That is OUR son!

1434
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:19,413
And is what, is the same son that you never see

1435
01:25:19,446 --> 01:25:20,948
because you're always working.

1436
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:22,083
Corey: That's not fair.

1437
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:24,319
I put a roof over his head, put food in his mouth.

1438
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,786
Matt, let's go!

1439
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,154
Sydney: Stop it!

1440
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,390
Do you really want him to see us doing this right here?

1441
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:31,826
Corey: No, I don't want him to see this.

1442
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:35,162
Just like I don't want him to see his mother

1443
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,465
with some welfare bitch from next door.

1444
01:25:37,498 --> 01:25:39,299
You think for a second I'm not fightin' you for Matt,

1445
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,635
you have another thing coming, you got that?

1446
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:42,970
What are you trying to prove?

1447
01:25:43,003 --> 01:25:43,804
Sydney: Nothing, Corey!

1448
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:45,240
Okay, nothing!

1449
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,474
Corey: Are you moving towards something

1450
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:50,378
or running away from something?

1451
01:25:54,014 --> 01:25:55,583
Sydney: You know what, Corey?

1452
01:25:55,616 --> 01:25:57,218
If you would've asked me that months ago,

1453
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,053
I wouldn't have known the answer.

1454
01:25:59,086 --> 01:26:02,590
But I think you know the answer and it scares you.

1455
01:26:02,623 --> 01:26:05,827
Well, you know what? It scared me too.

1456
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,235
Pastor: Good morning.

1457
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:15,736
Congregation: Good morning.

1458
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,804
(chuckles)

1459
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:20,274
Pastor: Today, I want to talk to you about

1460
01:26:20,307 --> 01:26:24,612
wanting something from God.

1461
01:26:24,645 --> 01:26:30,317
I said, wanting something from God.

1462
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,621
Pastor: You see, you can pray

1463
01:26:33,654 --> 01:26:36,824
and ask for anything you want and get it,

1464
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,361
as long as it lines up with the word of God.

1465
01:26:40,394 --> 01:26:43,798
You want joy, peace, a great marriage?

1466
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:48,536
Ask God and allow Him to order your steps

1467
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:50,371
and watch what happens.

1468
01:26:50,404 --> 01:26:53,040
Ha-ha. Oh, come on, now.

1469
01:26:53,073 --> 01:26:55,309
You see, the effectual fervent prayer

1470
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:58,346
of a righteous man availeth much.

1471
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,281
Oh, ya'll don't know what I'm talkin' about today.

1472
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:03,284
I want you to open with me in your Bibles

1473
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:06,754
to James 5 and 16.

1474
01:27:06,787 --> 01:27:11,926
That's James, chapter 5, verse 16.

1475
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:17,898
It says, "Therefore, confess your sins

1476
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:21,235
"to one another, and pray for one another,

1477
01:27:21,268 --> 01:27:23,871
"that you may be healed."

1478
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,240
Aw, come on. Can I get an Amen?

1479
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,308
Congregation: Amen.

1480
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,308
Pastor: Aw, yes.

1481
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:32,212
You see, the prayer of the righteous is powerful

1482
01:27:32,246 --> 01:27:34,182
and effective.

1483
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:36,351
Aw, ya'll don't know what I'm talkin' about today.

1484
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:40,821
You see, we all want things from God.

1485
01:27:40,854 --> 01:27:46,728
Oh, we do, but are we prepared to receive them?

1486
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,229
Stay with me now.

1487
01:27:48,262 --> 01:27:52,199
You see, God's not trying to condemn you.

1488
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:53,667
(chuckles)

1489
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:58,072
God wants to heal you, heal your wounds.

1490
01:27:58,105 --> 01:28:02,076
Be they emotional or physical,

1491
01:28:02,109 --> 01:28:06,347
but you see, God looks at the heart.

1492
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:11,252
Do you have a heart to do right?

1493
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:20,227
Sydney: Hey, thanks for the ride.

1494
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,096
Geri: Sure, no problem.

1495
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,565
It's easy to get caught up, huh?

1496
01:28:24,598 --> 01:28:26,033
Soon as you had that thought in your head

1497
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,801
and you weren't willing to let it go,

1498
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:29,804
it was only a matter of time.

1499
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,806
Sydney: A matter of time before what?

1500
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:33,140
Geri: Oh, I don't know.

1501
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:34,808
Fucking your little girlfriend, maybe.

1502
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,377
Sydney: You know, it's not even like that.

1503
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:37,311
Geri: Oh, come on.

1504
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:38,646
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

1505
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:41,148
It's exactly like that.

1506
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:42,717
Hey, I know you love her.

1507
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,718
Fuck, Jane is pretty.

1508
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:45,887
I see what you see in her.

1509
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,454
Sydney: No you don't.

1510
01:28:47,487 --> 01:28:49,556
Geri: How do you think I felt about Carla?

1511
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:52,427
Sydney: I don't know. How did you feel?

1512
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:57,298
Geri: We built this tree house without a roof.

1513
01:28:57,331 --> 01:28:59,767
Man, in the summertimes, we'd go down there,

1514
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,971
and we would stare at the stars all night.

1515
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,373
Sydney: Sounds nice.

1516
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:08,809
Geri: Yeah. Sometimes,

1517
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,779
sometimes I can still feel her lying next to me.

1518
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:15,148
Sydney: Wait, okay, you're totally confusing me.

1519
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:17,184
So you're telling me you love somebody that much,

1520
01:29:17,217 --> 01:29:18,519
but you're willing to walk away.

1521
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,221
You don't even give it a second thought?

1522
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:22,656
Geri: You think it was easy for me to just walk away?

1523
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,792
I fuckin' loved that girl!

1524
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,527
But I loved God too.

1525
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,995
I had to make a choice.

1526
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:33,700
You see, Syd, something is always gotta be given up.

1527
01:29:33,734 --> 01:29:36,336
When you think about the incredible sacrifices

1528
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:40,040
that Jesus Christ made for humanity, for us,

1529
01:29:40,073 --> 01:29:42,076
the sacrifices that we have to make for Him

1530
01:29:42,109 --> 01:29:43,644
are like nothing.

1531
01:29:43,677 --> 01:29:45,880
I gotta save as many people as I can.

1532
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:47,448
Sydney: Save them from what?

1533
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:48,448
You know what?

1534
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:50,818
I've played by every fucking rule in that book,

1535
01:29:50,851 --> 01:29:51,952
and you're telling me that God

1536
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,887
is a god that wants us to be miserable

1537
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,489
so that we can show Him our love?

1538
01:29:55,522 --> 01:29:57,557
Geri: I'm saying you have a choice to make.

1539
01:29:57,591 --> 01:29:58,692
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1540
01:29:58,725 --> 01:29:59,793
Sydney: I made my choice!

1541
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:00,728
Geri: Yeah, the wrong one.

1542
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:01,395
Sydney: You know what?

1543
01:30:01,428 --> 01:30:03,464
That's the shit I don't like.

1544
01:30:03,497 --> 01:30:05,565
Yeah, oh, free will, no condemnation.

1545
01:30:05,599 --> 01:30:06,734
Free will?

1546
01:30:06,767 --> 01:30:08,836
There's only one will in the church,

1547
01:30:08,869 --> 01:30:11,072
and that's God's or you go to hell.

1548
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:12,506
Geri: I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

1549
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:13,240
Sydney: Ugh!

1550
01:30:13,273 --> 01:30:14,541
Geri: You think I like men?

1551
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,343
you think I wanna fuckin' be with a man?

1552
01:30:16,376 --> 01:30:17,978
Hell, no!

1553
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:20,181
I made the choice to be by myself

1554
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:21,815
for the rest of my life.

1555
01:30:21,848 --> 01:30:22,817
that's the kind of shit

1556
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,652
I'm talking about giving up, Sydney.

1557
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:25,820
Sydney: Well, that sucks.

1558
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:29,056
Geri: Well, fuckin' grow up.

1559
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,994
(door opens)

1560
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,531
(door closes)

1561
01:30:43,637 --> 01:30:45,606
Sydney: Why didn't you tell me it was you?

1562
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,040
Jane: Because I,

1563
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:50,310
I wanted you to fall in love with me on your own.

1564
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,579
You know? With just plain Jane.

1565
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:56,283
With all my ugly sides, you know?

1566
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:58,486
Not some girl that you're indebted to,

1567
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,088
or you think you owe.

1568
01:31:01,121 --> 01:31:04,158
It's the same way I wanted to fall for you, if I did.

1569
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:06,226
I just, without force,

1570
01:31:06,259 --> 01:31:09,429
so I had to wait for us to meet naturally,

1571
01:31:09,463 --> 01:31:11,799
so I knew for sure.

1572
01:31:12,566 --> 01:31:14,368
Sydney: I write in this shirt.

1573
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,504
This is my favorite shirt.

1574
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:17,772
Jane: Yeah, that?

1575
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,840
You're going to have to ask your husband about

1576
01:31:19,873 --> 01:31:22,076
because he had this really crazy

1577
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:25,279
Edward Scissorhand thing going on the other day.

1578
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:28,382
(sighs)

1579
01:31:29,783 --> 01:31:34,222
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

1580
01:31:37,824 --> 01:31:39,427
Sydney: It's okay.

1581
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:44,932
Oh, don't let him take it!

1582
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,169
Come here.

1583
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:49,469
Gimme the ball!

1584
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:50,871
Jane: Sydney.

1585
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:52,773
Can you help Tony with his lay-ups?

1586
01:31:52,806 --> 01:31:54,541
He just takes jump shots in games.

1587
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:56,043
Sydney: Yeah, sure.

1588
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:56,977
Hey, can you go sit over there

1589
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:58,312
and play with John for a minute?

1590
01:31:58,345 --> 01:32:00,881
Matt: Mom, I wanna play with you and Tony.

1591
01:32:00,914 --> 01:32:02,616
Sydney: Just for a minute, sweetheart, okay?

1592
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:03,917
Then you can come back and play, I promise.

1593
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,552
Matt: I don't wanna play with John.

1594
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:06,587
He just sits there.

1595
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:08,055
I wanna play basketball.

1596
01:32:08,088 --> 01:32:10,757
Sydney: Come here.

1597
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,359
Hey, what is this attitude about?

1598
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:13,560
I don't have time for this.

1599
01:32:13,593 --> 01:32:15,963
Matt: You're my mom, not his.

1600
01:32:15,996 --> 01:32:17,598
Sydney: Oh, I can't help anyone else?

1601
01:32:18,765 --> 01:32:19,834
You know what? I think you need to go sit down

1602
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:20,767
next to Jane and John,

1603
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,536
and think about thow to be a nicer person.

1604
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:24,171
Matt: But, Mom.

1605
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:26,406
Sydney: Don't 'But, Mom.' Go!

1606
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,576
I mean it!

1607
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:33,981
(dramatic music)

1608
01:32:42,589 --> 01:32:45,126
(laughs)

1609
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:49,730
Sydney: Hey, when you become a big famous astronaut,

1610
01:32:49,763 --> 01:32:51,565
I want you to come back and tell me what it's like

1611
01:32:51,598 --> 01:32:53,267
to float through the air.

1612
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,336
Matt: Why would I be floating?

1613
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,105
Sydney: You'll see.

1614
01:32:58,138 --> 01:33:01,208
Matt: Mommy, are you gonna marry Jane?

1615
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:03,210
Sydney: I don't know.

1616
01:33:03,243 --> 01:33:04,445
Do you want me to marry Jane?

1617
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:06,947
Matt: No. I want you to be with Daddy.

1618
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:09,517
He's a good daddy.

1619
01:33:17,157 --> 01:33:19,560
Corey: Can I join my family?

1620
01:33:19,593 --> 01:33:20,995
Matt: Daddy!

1621
01:33:21,528 --> 01:33:23,464
Corey: Hey, buddy.

1622
01:33:25,165 --> 01:33:28,336
Sydney: Corey, what are you doing here?

1623
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:35,142
(panting)

1624
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,278
Corey: I thought I'd find you here.

1625
01:33:38,311 --> 01:33:39,413
(sighs)

1626
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:40,581
I brought some sandwiches

1627
01:33:40,614 --> 01:33:43,618
and some water in there.

1628
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:51,158
I'm not leaving here without Matt.

1629
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,362
My son needs his father.

1630
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:56,930
Sydney: Oh, really?

1631
01:33:56,963 --> 01:33:57,831
And what are you gonna do with him

1632
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:59,900
when you're gone every single week, huh?

1633
01:33:59,933 --> 01:34:02,169
Corey: Sydney, I quit.

1634
01:34:02,202 --> 01:34:05,739
And now, and now we can do this.

1635
01:34:05,772 --> 01:34:09,810
You and me and Matt, you said so yourself.

1636
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:11,044
We make sense.

1637
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:12,746
Sydney: Do you really wanna be with somebody

1638
01:34:12,779 --> 01:34:14,782
who's not in love with you?

1639
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,652
Is that fair to you or to me, huh?

1640
01:34:19,653 --> 01:34:23,056
I remember our dreams, Corey, I do.

1641
01:34:23,089 --> 01:34:23,858
But that's all they were.

1642
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:24,891
They were just dreams.

1643
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:26,226
They were illusions that couldn't have been

1644
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:29,563
further from the truth, and you know it.

1645
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,832
Corey: What would make you

1646
01:34:31,865 --> 01:34:34,235
want to be with another woman?

1647
01:34:36,136 --> 01:34:39,507
Where did I fail you as a man?

1648
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,675
Sydney: You didn't fail me, Corey.

1649
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,644
you didn't do anything.

1650
01:34:43,677 --> 01:34:44,712
(sighs)

1651
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:49,149
God, you're handsome, you're smart, you're loyal.

1652
01:34:49,182 --> 01:34:50,384
You are every woman's fantasy.

1653
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,185
You're just not-

1654
01:34:51,218 --> 01:34:53,854
Corey: Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1655
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:58,159
This is not how this was supposed to end.

1656
01:34:58,192 --> 01:34:59,159
Sydney: Oh, yeah?

1657
01:34:59,192 --> 01:35:01,128
Then how's it supposed to end, Corey, huh?

1658
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:03,230
How about you tell me?

1659
01:35:03,263 --> 01:35:05,132
Corey: You wanna know?

1660
01:35:05,165 --> 01:35:06,834
I'll fucking show you.

1661
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,101
Matt, let's go! We're going home!

1662
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:09,235
Sydney: Stop it!

1663
01:35:09,269 --> 01:35:11,438
I am not going to play tug of war with our son!

1664
01:35:11,471 --> 01:35:12,672
Corey: You think you're just going to get

1665
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:14,174
everything you want?

1666
01:35:14,207 --> 01:35:15,509
You think I'm just going to sit back while,

1667
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:20,314
while you're with her in front of my son?

1668
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:23,851
Right next door to me?

1669
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:25,619
Sydney: Are you done?

1670
01:35:26,953 --> 01:35:30,991
Corey: I'm done when I say I'm done.

1671
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:34,462
Sydney: I can't make myself be in love with you, okay?

1672
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:38,899
I tried for five years, but I can't do it anymore.

1673
01:35:38,932 --> 01:35:41,135
i don't want this plastic life, okay?

1674
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:44,704
I want the real thing, why can't you get that?

1675
01:35:44,738 --> 01:35:46,039
(dramatic music)

1676
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:49,877
Stop! Corey, don't do this, please.

1677
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,745
Corey, stop!

1678
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:55,482
(crying)

1679
01:35:55,515 --> 01:35:58,786
Please, stop. Don't do this.

1680
01:36:02,122 --> 01:36:04,091
Oh, God!

1681
01:36:18,004 --> 01:36:19,640
(door opens)

1682
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,218
(door creaks)

1683
01:36:51,204 --> 01:36:56,610
(soft music plays)

1684
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:03,950
Sydney: Hey.

1685
01:37:03,983 --> 01:37:05,486
Jane: What are you doing?

1686
01:37:26,139 --> 01:37:28,875
How did you know this is so what I needed?

1687
01:37:28,908 --> 01:37:32,546
Sydney: Mmm, 'cause i just know.

1688
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:33,780
Jane: Oh, you just know?

1689
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:34,681
Sydney: Yeah.

1690
01:37:34,714 --> 01:37:36,049
Jane: What do you know?

1691
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,017
Sydney: Remember when you told me

1692
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:39,152
there was one thing that Jimmy couldn't give you?

1693
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,955
Jane: Mm-hmm.

1694
01:37:42,222 --> 01:37:44,592
Sydney: I know what that one thing is now.

1695
01:37:50,864 --> 01:37:53,733
So, I got a new idea for a screenplay.

1696
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:54,568
Jane: You do?

1697
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:56,003
Sydney: Mm-hmm.

1698
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:57,137
Jane: What is it?

1699
01:37:57,171 --> 01:37:58,439
Sydney: This.

1700
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:01,608
I mean this whole situation.

1701
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:03,410
It's like a movie, you know?

1702
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:04,544
Jane: Really? This?

1703
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:05,379
Sydney: Yeah.

1704
01:38:06,246 --> 01:38:09,650
Hmm. Who do you think would play me?

1705
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,418
Sydney: Somebody beautiful.

1706
01:38:12,452 --> 01:38:13,754
Jane: Aww.

1707
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:15,655
Sydney: I'm really excited about it.

1708
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:20,995
Jane: Yeah. Is that what tonight was all about?

1709
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:24,031
Sydney: No. Tonight was about you.

1710
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:27,400
The screenplay thing was just icing on the cake.

1711
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,803
Jane: You haven't written anything in a while.

1712
01:38:29,836 --> 01:38:30,937
Sydney: I know.

1713
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,474
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.

1714
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:34,707
(takes a deep breath)

1715
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:37,945
I want to go up to Sedona in the mountains, just for a week.

1716
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:39,914
Jane: Yeah?

1717
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:43,817
Sydney: I have to go alone.

1718
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:46,487
I need to get started on my script.

1719
01:38:49,523 --> 01:38:50,791
Hey.

1720
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:58,498
Listen, I didn't tell you before,

1721
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:03,069
but I have an agent who wants to represent me.

1722
01:39:03,102 --> 01:39:04,905
Yeah, and a Hollywood producer

1723
01:39:04,938 --> 01:39:06,372
made me an offer on my script.

1724
01:39:06,406 --> 01:39:09,510
Jane: Oh, my God! Sydney, this is huge!

1725
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:10,944
Sydney: I know.

1726
01:39:10,977 --> 01:39:12,245
Well, even though they took the first one,

1727
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:14,181
they want me to write another one, and babe,

1728
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:15,882
I gotta knock their fuckin' socks off on this one,

1729
01:39:15,915 --> 01:39:17,484
or I'm totally screwed.

1730
01:39:17,517 --> 01:39:18,718
Jane: Oh, why wouldn't they like it?

1731
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:19,819
Sydney: Oh, come on.

1732
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:21,254
Hollywood's not exactly female friendly.

1733
01:39:21,287 --> 01:39:23,223
they don't really take women seriously.

1734
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:24,324
Jane: Oh, bullshit.

1735
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:25,125
They don't know you.

1736
01:39:25,158 --> 01:39:27,995
(laughing and kissing)

1737
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:28,928
Oh, my God!

1738
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:30,797
Sydney: Oh, babe, you feel so good.

1739
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,766
Jane: Mm.

1740
01:39:35,569 --> 01:39:37,404
I'm in love with you.

1741
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:41,174
Sydney: What?

1742
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:42,809
Are you serious?

1743
01:39:42,842 --> 01:39:44,344
Jane: Yeah.

1744
01:39:44,377 --> 01:39:48,848
(laughing and kissing)

1745
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:53,754
(instrumental music)

1746
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:22,750
(waterfall)

1747
01:41:42,328 --> 01:41:43,930
Matt: A dog.

1748
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:46,033
Corey: Is it a dog or a monkey?

1749
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:46,866
Matt: A monkey.

1750
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:49,002
(chuckles)

1751
01:41:50,537 --> 01:41:51,938
Corey: It says to go down.

1752
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:57,744
(phone rings)

1753
01:41:57,778 --> 01:41:59,245
Hit pause, Matt.

1754
01:41:59,279 --> 01:41:59,713
(phone beeps)

1755
01:41:59,746 --> 01:42:00,447
Hello.

1756
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,785
Yeah.

1757
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,224
Yes.

1758
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:16,497
(dramatic music)

1759
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:51,465
(door closes)

1760
01:43:02,642 --> 01:43:03,877
(Jane gasps)

1761
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:05,646
Pastor: What's going on here?

1762
01:43:08,414 --> 01:43:10,683
Corey: THIS WOMAN!

1763
01:43:10,716 --> 01:43:14,120
(panting)

1764
01:43:14,154 --> 01:43:16,023
This woman ...

1765
01:43:18,057 --> 01:43:19,193
Jane: What?

1766
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:26,133
(crying)

1767
01:43:26,566 --> 01:43:31,271
(dramatic music)

1768
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:34,875
Oh.

1769
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,987
Duncan: Corey, man.

1770
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:51,257
It's not your story.

1771
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,592
You gotta let it go.

1772
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:55,062
You have to forgive 'em.

1773
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:58,532
She was your wife, man.

1774
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:01,635
She wrote her ending.

1775
01:44:01,668 --> 01:44:06,273
You gotta stand up like a man and write yours.

1776
01:44:19,352 --> 01:44:28,495
(crying)

1777
01:44:29,862 --> 01:44:31,765
Jane: What!?

1778
01:44:31,798 --> 01:44:34,034
What are you looking at?

1779
01:44:34,067 --> 01:44:35,836
Pastor: A frightened child.

1780
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:37,270
Jane: Oh, you don't know me.

1781
01:44:37,304 --> 01:44:38,871
Pastor: Oh, come on, come.

1782
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:40,907
Jane: None of you know me.

1783
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:45,012
You look at me and you just see one thing.

1784
01:44:45,045 --> 01:44:49,316
She looked at me and saw everything!

1785
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:52,919
Everything I could be, and all that I am,

1786
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:55,922
and everything I could be.

1787
01:44:55,955 --> 01:45:03,763
None of you idiots could see what people could be ...

1788
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:05,866
I can't do this.

1789
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,402
Oh.

1790
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:19,078
Oh, baby. We didn't have enough time.

1791
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:22,348
I needed you to stay

1792
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:24,851
because we didn't have enough time.

1793
01:45:24,884 --> 01:45:26,086
(sniffs)

1794
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:31,591
(dramatic music continues)

1795
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:05,559
(tearing envelope)

1796
01:46:21,507 --> 01:46:23,777
Corey: There must be some kind of mistake.

1797
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:27,481
My wife and I never had life insurance.

1798
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:30,884
We couldn't even afford health insurance.

1799
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:32,552
Voiceover: Well, Mr. Harris.

1800
01:46:32,585 --> 01:46:37,390
It says here that she's had it since 1977,

1801
01:46:37,424 --> 01:46:38,991
a year after she was born.

1802
01:46:39,025 --> 01:46:41,561
She requested you and your son be the beneficiaries

1803
01:46:41,594 --> 01:46:42,929
just a few months ago.

1804
01:46:42,962 --> 01:46:45,499
Corey: But her, her thyroid cancer.

1805
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:47,467
Voiceover: The policy covers all causes of death,

1806
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:50,703
Mr. Harris, with the exception of suicide.

1807
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:53,272
We apologize for the delay in getting your check.

1808
01:46:53,305 --> 01:46:54,641
There was actually a matter with

1809
01:46:54,674 --> 01:46:55,808
the Sedona police department

1810
01:46:55,841 --> 01:46:58,845
that needed to be squared away first.

1811
01:47:03,082 --> 01:47:04,751
Corey: The police?

1812
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,087
(phone beeps)

1813
01:47:18,565 --> 01:47:25,772
(papers rustling)

1814
01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:45,492
(TV static)

1815
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:50,864
(tape rewinds)

1816
01:47:56,502 --> 01:47:57,970
Sydney: Hey, babe.

1817
01:47:58,003 --> 01:47:58,904
(sighs)

1818
01:47:58,938 --> 01:48:01,340
It feels so good to be up here.

1819
01:48:01,373 --> 01:48:02,842
I mean, I really feel at home.

1820
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:04,177
(thunder)

1821
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:06,746
Like I'm at your home.

1822
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:08,281
It was amazing.

1823
01:48:08,314 --> 01:48:10,182
I was down by the creek writing the other day,

1824
01:48:10,216 --> 01:48:14,621
and, God, it felt so good.

1825
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:17,557
I mean, it was really, really good,

1826
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:19,692
and I just want you to know,

1827
01:48:19,725 --> 01:48:21,193
I really appreciate you understanding

1828
01:48:21,227 --> 01:48:24,097
why I had to come up here.

1829
01:48:25,698 --> 01:48:28,901
You'd be so proud of me, babe.

1830
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:32,037
I finished the screenplay.

1831
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:34,974
(biting into apple and chewing)

1832
01:48:35,007 --> 01:48:39,011
Sydney: What if on my laptop, right now,

1833
01:48:39,045 --> 01:48:42,616
is the next Academy Award-winning screenplay?

1834
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:45,519
Can you imagine?

1835
01:48:50,656 --> 01:48:55,461
Sydney: Hm. I know it seems silly, but it's me.

1836
01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:57,897
I mean, I wanna believe in

1837
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:00,267
what seems like the impossible

1838
01:49:03,869 --> 01:49:05,572
(sighs)

1839
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:13,680
or what Corey likes to call pipe dreams.

1840
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:19,085
All I ever wanted

1841
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:21,955
was for you to believe in my career, Corey.

1842
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:25,891
You know, for you to believe in me.

1843
01:49:25,925 --> 01:49:28,294
I don't know if would have changed anything,

1844
01:49:28,327 --> 01:49:32,498
but it would have been nice.

1845
01:49:32,531 --> 01:49:34,867
I love her.

1846
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:37,904
I'm in love with her, and I know it hurts,

1847
01:49:37,937 --> 01:49:40,173
but I can't lie to you and to Matt,

1848
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:42,809
and I cannot lie to myself.

1849
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:47,314
I don't want to say goodbye like this.

1850
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:05,265
(persistent knocking)

1851
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:06,900
Jane: What?

1852
01:50:09,368 --> 01:50:11,103
Corey: Before she left,

1853
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:13,706
did you think she was going to kill herself?

1854
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:14,874
Jane: What are you talking about?

1855
01:50:14,907 --> 01:50:17,543
Corey: Sydney, her character in her script kills herself,

1856
01:50:17,577 --> 01:50:21,147
and the movie, the screenplay just fuckin' ends.

1857
01:50:21,181 --> 01:50:25,084
I, my character goes his way, your character goes hers.

1858
01:50:25,117 --> 01:50:28,354
Jane: No, she wouldn't kill herself.

1859
01:50:28,387 --> 01:50:29,622
Corey: Samantha cuts her apple

1860
01:50:29,656 --> 01:50:30,589
Jane: Ugh.

1861
01:50:30,623 --> 01:50:32,258
Samantha is Sydney.

1862
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:33,960
Samantha cuts her apple into fours,

1863
01:50:33,993 --> 01:50:36,362
eating each piece slowly like it's her last.

1864
01:50:36,395 --> 01:50:37,730
Finishing her last bite,

1865
01:50:37,763 --> 01:50:39,565
Samantha lays in the middle of her bed

1866
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:41,734
with the knife, holding it up to her wrists,

1867
01:50:41,767 --> 01:50:42,735
and slits herself.

1868
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:44,203
Blood squirts everywhere, she dies.

1869
01:50:44,236 --> 01:50:45,472
Jane: Bravo!

1870
01:50:45,505 --> 01:50:47,774
Sydney's a brilliant screenwriter.

1871
01:50:47,807 --> 01:50:51,610
She made up all that bullshit to impress producers.

1872
01:50:51,644 --> 01:50:54,914
She died because the cancer spread, and you know that.

1873
01:50:54,947 --> 01:50:56,683
You wouldn't have gotten any insurance money

1874
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:59,752
off a suicide anyway.

1875
01:50:59,785 --> 01:51:01,421
Corey: How did you know I ...

1876
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:02,088
No, no, no.

1877
01:51:03,022 --> 01:51:04,890
They claimed they traced the cause of death

1878
01:51:04,924 --> 01:51:06,559
back to the cancer.

1879
01:51:06,592 --> 01:51:09,729
Her body was found in her cabin,

1880
01:51:09,762 --> 01:51:12,432
in the middle of the bed.

1881
01:51:14,067 --> 01:51:17,169
Jane: I don't believe you.

1882
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:19,138
She wouldn't have killed herself.

1883
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:20,673
She was happy.

1884
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:22,074
She was happy.

1885
01:51:22,107 --> 01:51:23,409
She loves me, and I love her.

1886
01:51:23,442 --> 01:51:24,210
Corey: Why don't you spare me

1887
01:51:24,243 --> 01:51:25,544
the Hallmark greeting card, okay?

1888
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:27,313
Jane: Oh, fuck you, Corey.

1889
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:30,049
I mean, it's not like she can be with me anymore.

1890
01:51:30,082 --> 01:51:31,617
What do you want from this?

1891
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:33,153
What the fuck do you want?

1892
01:51:35,087 --> 01:51:37,356
Corey: Because if she killed herself,

1893
01:51:37,389 --> 01:51:39,658
it's because she was hurting.

1894
01:51:39,692 --> 01:51:43,496
She was miserable, and she was lonely,

1895
01:51:45,498 --> 01:51:47,033
even with you.

1896
01:51:52,137 --> 01:52:02,515
Death, or death was her only way out.

1897
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:06,186
Jane: She was none of those things.

1898
01:52:15,995 --> 01:52:19,132
(door opens and shuts)

1899
01:52:19,165 --> 01:52:24,270
(music: Rest in My Love)

1900
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:44,924
(sung) Rest in my love. Oh, rest in my love.

1901
01:52:44,957 --> 01:52:47,327
Receptionist: Jane Smith?

1902
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,963
There a Jane Smith here?

1903
01:52:51,998 --> 01:52:53,399
Hi.

1904
01:52:53,432 --> 01:52:55,835
Is this your first interview with Trendy Cards?

1905
01:52:55,868 --> 01:53:00,907
(sung) Rest in my love.

1906
01:53:02,241 --> 01:53:17,356
(sung) Rest in my peace. Oh, rest in my peace.

1907
01:53:17,389 --> 01:53:25,131
(sung) While the world goes spinnin' round.

1908
01:53:25,164 --> 01:53:32,071
(sung) Rest in my peace.

1909
01:53:32,104 --> 01:53:44,250
(sung) The world keeps changin', and life rearrangin'

1910
01:53:44,283 --> 01:53:46,486
Corey: Are you scared?

1911
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:50,256
Matt: No, just daydreaming.

1912
01:53:55,962 --> 01:53:58,064
(car engine starts)

1913
01:54:01,767 --> 01:54:17,650
(sung) So rest in my love. Oh, rest in my love.

1914
01:54:17,683 --> 01:54:25,257
(sung) While the world goes spinnin' round,

1915
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:32,432
(sung) rest in my love.

1916
01:54:33,132 --> 01:54:43,443
(sung) Rest in my love.

1917
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:56,589
(music: I Wanna)

1918
01:55:15,274 --> 01:55:18,544
(sung) Wanna be alive, wanna be alive.

1919
01:55:19,778 --> 01:55:23,382
(sung) Yo, yo, I wanna live my life another day.

1920
01:55:23,415 --> 01:55:26,418
(sung) I wanna live my life without pain.

1921
01:55:26,451 --> 01:55:29,255
(sung) I wanna live my life without shame.

1922
01:55:29,288 --> 01:55:32,191
(sung) Just wanna stop runnin' and runnin' away.

1923
01:55:43,669 --> 01:55:46,171
(sung) Just a fan, that's a hearthrob.

1924
01:55:46,205 --> 01:55:47,807
(sung) Promiscuous female seed,

1925
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,610
(sung) which is why I'm a lonely man

1926
01:55:50,643 --> 01:55:53,278
(sung) waiting for life to tire of her affair.

1927
01:55:53,312 --> 01:55:55,681
(sung) I wanna chance to hold her, to kiss her,

1928
01:55:55,714 --> 01:55:58,117
(sung) to smell her hair.

1929
01:56:06,792 --> 01:56:11,264
(fades to instrumental movie theme)

1930
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:56,288
Wil: Action.

1931
01:59:56,322 --> 02:00:00,626
(dramatic music)

1932
02:00:08,033 --> 02:00:09,368
Man: Cut!

1933
02:00:10,469 --> 02:00:13,839
Jose: Corey is a disciplined guy.

1934
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:14,706
Has a lot of pride.

1935
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:16,074
He's a Marine.

1936
02:00:16,108 --> 02:00:18,644
He's moving his wife and son to Arizona

1937
02:00:18,677 --> 02:00:21,847
for a fresh start from the East Coast.

1938
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,315
Once his wife gets sick,

1939
02:00:23,349 --> 02:00:25,217
and she has this medical illness,

1940
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:28,821
he has to deal with that on top of everything else,

1941
02:00:28,854 --> 02:00:32,058
which is already a strained relationship,

1942
02:00:32,091 --> 02:00:33,759
and then on top of that,

1943
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,761
with Corey being gone a lot,

1944
02:00:35,794 --> 02:00:38,230
his wife happens to meet a neighbor,

1945
02:00:38,263 --> 02:00:40,666
and they fall in love.

1946
02:00:41,467 --> 02:00:44,403
Sevan: My role is, name's Tony,

1947
02:00:44,436 --> 02:00:50,809
and he is one of the sons of Jane.

1948
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:53,479
Rachel: Playing Jane has been very fun

1949
02:00:53,512 --> 02:00:55,781
because she's a lot like me.

1950
02:00:55,815 --> 02:00:59,451
I had a rough childhood in some aspects,

1951
02:00:59,484 --> 02:01:02,287
and so I've drawn on a lot of those things

1952
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,655
that have happened to me,

1953
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:06,658
that are very similar to Jane's experiences.

1954
02:01:06,692 --> 02:01:08,761
So I have put a lot of me into the role,

1955
02:01:08,794 --> 02:01:11,597
a lot more me than I normally get to do.

1956
02:01:11,630 --> 02:01:12,931
Eleni: Jane Smith's character,

1957
02:01:12,964 --> 02:01:14,700
played by Rachel Owens,

1958
02:01:14,733 --> 02:01:19,038
she's more Bohemian, free-spirited girl.

1959
02:01:19,071 --> 02:01:21,106
she's also into, like, Tarot cards

1960
02:01:21,139 --> 02:01:23,275
and Buddha, and all that,

1961
02:01:23,308 --> 02:01:25,878
so I used real warm, earthy colors,

1962
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:28,381
a lot more textures, softer textures,

1963
02:01:28,414 --> 02:01:30,850
more round edges.

1964
02:01:30,883 --> 02:01:32,451
Nitara: Action!

1965
02:01:32,485 --> 02:01:36,788
Orgena: Ask God, and allow him to order your steps,

1966
02:01:36,821 --> 02:01:39,758
and watch what happens! Ha ha!

1967
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:42,861
Well, Pastor Rita, she actually came from

1968
02:01:42,894 --> 02:01:44,963
the rough side of town.

1969
02:01:44,996 --> 02:01:48,634
She had quite a problem with drugs,

1970
02:01:48,667 --> 02:01:51,136
and she really pulled herself up

1971
02:01:51,169 --> 02:01:54,439
through going to church and changing her life around,

1972
02:01:54,473 --> 02:01:55,508
and she's tough.

1973
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:57,209
She's straightforward, no nonsense.

1974
02:01:57,242 --> 02:01:58,710
She tells it like it is.

1975
02:01:58,744 --> 02:02:02,081
Todd: My character is Staff Sergeant Maverick,

1976
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:07,085
and he is the soldier in lead of our lead actor,

1977
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:08,220
another supporting actor.

1978
02:02:08,253 --> 02:02:09,221
Corey: Stop the bleeding!

1979
02:02:09,254 --> 02:02:11,623
Marine: Get your goddamn shit together, jarhead!

1980
02:02:11,657 --> 02:02:12,858
Fuckin' move!

1981
02:02:12,891 --> 02:02:15,861
Todd: And I am just really a little jerk.

1982
02:02:15,895 --> 02:02:17,863
James: I play the role of John Duncan,

1983
02:02:17,896 --> 02:02:20,399
which is Corey's best friend in the Gulf War.

1984
02:02:20,432 --> 02:02:21,900
He's just a good ol' boy.

1985
02:02:21,933 --> 02:02:23,903
Back home, everyone loves him.

1986
02:02:23,936 --> 02:02:24,736
Speaks the truth.

1987
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:27,439
He doesn't really sugar coat anything.

1988
02:02:27,472 --> 02:02:28,740
Duncan: But you can't write the ending

1989
02:02:28,773 --> 02:02:30,375
to somebody else's life, man.

1990
02:02:30,409 --> 02:02:31,577
It ain't up to you.

1991
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:34,980
Wil: I first started when I was 4,

1992
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:40,319
and now I'm 7, so that's 3 years.

1993
02:02:40,352 --> 02:02:47,860
He's a 5-year-old kid who goes to kindergarten,

1994
02:02:47,893 --> 02:02:50,929
and he has a mom and a dad,

1995
02:02:50,962 --> 02:02:56,134
and their names are Corey and Sydney.

1996
02:02:56,168 --> 02:02:57,069
Georgia: I had an opportunity to be

1997
02:02:57,102 --> 02:02:59,672
the location scout, which was really fun,

1998
02:02:59,705 --> 02:03:00,706
very rewarding.

1999
02:03:00,739 --> 02:03:02,441
People tell you, "Yes, absolutely.

2000
02:03:02,474 --> 02:03:03,409
"You can use our place,"

2001
02:03:03,442 --> 02:03:05,010
and then when you go back to

2002
02:03:05,044 --> 02:03:07,312
sign the property release form, they come back and say,

2003
02:03:07,345 --> 02:03:09,114
"Sorry, we changed our mind."

2004
02:03:09,147 --> 02:03:10,249
Eleni: Here's the story:

2005
02:03:10,282 --> 02:03:12,585
Now, we're shootin' at this park.

2006
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:15,087
We found this park and we kept it

2007
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:18,089
because originally, our houses locations

2008
02:03:18,123 --> 02:03:21,360
was this one over here was supposed to be Jane's house,

2009
02:03:21,393 --> 02:03:24,162
and that one over there, 519,

2010
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:26,765
that was supposed to be Sydney's house,

2011
02:03:26,798 --> 02:03:29,168
and, like, last minute, we had them locked down,

2012
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:33,005
whatever happened, they fell through,

2013
02:03:33,038 --> 02:03:36,308
and so that was part of our saga and challenge

2014
02:03:36,341 --> 02:03:39,277
of getting the houses down on 4th Avenue.

2015
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:41,880
Georgia: It's just learning to be very flexible

2016
02:03:41,913 --> 02:03:43,516
and just never giving up,

2017
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:45,251
and just fighting to the last minute,

2018
02:03:45,284 --> 02:03:48,120
'til you finally secure the location.

2019
02:03:48,153 --> 02:03:51,590
Eleni: But then we ended up diagonal from each other,

2020
02:03:51,623 --> 02:03:54,526
which is truly how it's written in the script,

2021
02:03:54,559 --> 02:03:58,897
so everything always works out, you know?

2022
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:01,033
Man: We're using a special type of makeup.

2023
02:04:01,066 --> 02:04:02,134
We could have gone out

2024
02:04:02,167 --> 02:04:03,569
and got actual rub-off tatoos made

2025
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:05,337
to make this process easier

2026
02:04:05,370 --> 02:04:06,871
for the limited number of days that she's on it,

2027
02:04:06,905 --> 02:04:09,175
we'll just hand paint them like this.

2028
02:04:09,208 --> 02:04:10,642
Todd: As you know, the process of being a producer

2029
02:04:10,675 --> 02:04:12,010
and putting a film together,

2030
02:04:12,043 --> 02:04:14,446
finding the right crew with the right vibe,

2031
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:16,148
and everyone gets along as such,

2032
02:04:16,181 --> 02:04:19,918
so my overall with, who we have on this project right now,

2033
02:04:19,951 --> 02:04:21,119
has been totally awesome.

2034
02:04:21,152 --> 02:04:22,320
Everyone's cooperative,

2035
02:04:22,354 --> 02:04:25,390
everyone works well, communication is there,

2036
02:04:25,424 --> 02:04:28,727
and the project's moving along at a great pace,

2037
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:31,030
and I can appreciate that.

2038
02:04:31,063 --> 02:04:34,933
Kevin: It is 6:44, running behind,

2039
02:04:34,966 --> 02:04:37,369
but we're going to make it up.

2040
02:04:37,402 --> 02:04:38,970
We're gonna get ready to be done

2041
02:04:39,003 --> 02:04:45,043
with 8 and 4/8th pages in about nine hours.

2042
02:04:45,076 --> 02:04:46,411
Eleni: This company called MACV,

2043
02:04:46,444 --> 02:04:48,280
he provided a lot of their gear,

2044
02:04:48,313 --> 02:04:50,249
uniforms, the tents, stuff like that.

2045
02:04:50,282 --> 02:04:51,517
I was more about connecting with people

2046
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:52,584
and doing my research

2047
02:04:52,617 --> 02:04:54,486
and making sure everything was period-appropriate,

2048
02:04:54,519 --> 02:04:57,422
because I don't want any Marines seeing this movie

2049
02:04:57,455 --> 02:04:59,091
and picking anything out,

2050
02:04:59,124 --> 02:05:01,593
and being like, "Hey, that's not how it happened,"

2051
02:05:01,627 --> 02:05:03,796
or "We didn't have that there."

2052
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:05,631
James: I was also in desert storm,

2053
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:10,035
so I was able to draw upon my experience

2054
02:05:10,068 --> 02:05:11,270
of being in the desert,

2055
02:05:11,303 --> 02:05:14,740
being over there when missiles were flying overhead.

2056
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:19,444
Things like that to things you don't really wanna recall,

2057
02:05:19,477 --> 02:05:24,250
but in this case, it served a purpose.

2058
02:05:24,283 --> 02:05:26,218
Rachel: The biggest challenge for me was the arm.

2059
02:05:26,251 --> 02:05:30,222
Jane Smith is a burn victim,

2060
02:05:30,255 --> 02:05:31,890
and originally in the script,

2061
02:05:31,923 --> 02:05:34,092
she wasn't a burn victim.

2062
02:05:34,126 --> 02:05:36,928
She had CP, and we decided to change it

2063
02:05:36,962 --> 02:05:38,497
to a burn victim for the story,

2064
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:40,665
the director decided to change it,

2065
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:44,302
so I've had collodion on my arm

2066
02:05:44,336 --> 02:05:46,571
to produce the scar damage and tissue damage.

2067
02:05:46,605 --> 02:05:49,174
That's been really hard because the removal

2068
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:52,244
and application of the actual collodion

2069
02:05:52,277 --> 02:05:53,945
is very rough on my skin,

2070
02:05:53,979 --> 02:05:57,282
and surprisingly, that has affected all aspects

2071
02:05:57,315 --> 02:06:01,486
of performance because it hinders my movement,

2072
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,455
and it's on my mind,

2073
02:06:03,488 --> 02:06:05,691
but at the same time, it helps me because

2074
02:06:05,724 --> 02:06:08,326
that's something that a burn victim would deal with.

2075
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:09,495
James: Films are normally done with

2076
02:06:09,528 --> 02:06:12,897
a lot of emotion from the director and the writer anyway,

2077
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:16,701
but in this case, I just felt something different

2078
02:06:16,735 --> 02:06:17,769
in Nitara and Maury,

2079
02:06:17,802 --> 02:06:18,870
I mean they're just good people,

2080
02:06:18,904 --> 02:06:22,675
and it's something I knew I wanted to be a part of.

2081
02:06:22,708 --> 02:06:25,677
Jose: She had us go out and have, like, family days,

2082
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:28,747
where it's just us hangin' out at the park,

2083
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:31,383
playin' ball, just 'til all of us are, you know,

2084
02:06:31,416 --> 02:06:33,751
familiar and comfortable with each other,

2085
02:06:33,785 --> 02:06:36,255
so once we get on set, it's not just, you know,

2086
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,423
strangers, you know, acting.

2087
02:06:38,456 --> 02:06:43,562
this past year, it was really great to see how excited

2088
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:46,565
she was, and how much this project meant to her,

2089
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:49,901
because it makes you wanna work that much harder,

2090
02:06:49,934 --> 02:06:51,970
and just do everything you can, you know what I mean?

2091
02:06:52,003 --> 02:06:53,572
Because that's what she's doing.

2092
02:06:53,605 --> 02:06:55,173
Nitara: He needs some love.

2093
02:06:55,206 --> 02:06:56,808
Rachel: Nitara's directing is actually much different

2094
02:06:56,842 --> 02:06:57,876
than in rehearsals.

2095
02:06:57,909 --> 02:06:59,711
On set, this is what she tells me.

2096
02:06:59,744 --> 02:07:01,146
"Just look good on film!"

2097
02:07:01,179 --> 02:07:03,015
"Just look good on film!"

2098
02:07:03,048 --> 02:07:04,716
(laughs)

2099
02:07:04,749 --> 02:07:06,785
So, I know what she means by that, though,

2100
02:07:06,819 --> 02:07:08,554
because we did so much rehearsal.

2101
02:07:08,587 --> 02:07:10,956
Orgena: (laughs) I see great things for this film,

2102
02:07:10,989 --> 02:07:11,723
I really do.

2103
02:07:11,756 --> 02:07:14,559
I think it's a fantastic project,

2104
02:07:14,592 --> 02:07:16,295
a great subject matter,

2105
02:07:16,328 --> 02:07:18,429
and I think it's well done with great actors,

2106
02:07:18,463 --> 02:07:22,067
great direction, great everybody.
