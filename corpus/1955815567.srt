00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,774
Ready? Let's go.

373
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:50,581
<i> The woman was smart,</i>

374
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,082
<i> and when I thought</i>
<i> I was close,</i>

375
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,351
<i> she was always</i>
<i> a step ahead...</i>

376
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,155
<i> heading</i>
<i> to another safe house.</i>

377
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:01,291
<i> She had 'em</i>
<i> all over the city.</i>

378
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,130
Hurry!

379
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,303
What are you doing?
Get in.

380
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,304
But-but my apartment.

381
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,273
I mean,
are we coming back?

382
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,341
No.

383
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,642
I can't just leave!

384
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:20,043
Now, listen to me.

385
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,412
I told you
I'd always take care of you.

386
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:26,650
This is your real family now,
please, Carolina.

387
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,385
-Okay?
-Okay.

388
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,890
The new guy
did well under pressure.

389
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,324
He stuck to the plan.

390
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:35,292
-Get rid of him.
-He didn't talk.

391
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,727
-He got caught.
-He's in jail.

392
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:37,895
-Get rid of him!
-All right.

393
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,062
[engine starts]

394
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,167
<i> She vanished.</i>

395
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,836
<i> Maybe I was too close.</i>

396
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:49,039
<i> They headed to Miami,</i>
<i> where business was booming,</i>

397
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:53,477
<i> and all that competition</i>
<i>ignited her thirst for blood,</i>

398
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,612
<i> and the ideas</i>
<i> just kept coming,</i>

399
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,814
<i> including</i>
<i> one of her signature moves--</i>

400
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,951
<i> drive-by</i>
<i> motorcycle assassins.</i>

401
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,189
<i> Soon enough,</i>

402
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,659
<i> every cartel in the city</i>
<i> wanted her dead.</i>

403
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,662
<i> It was time</i>
<i> to step up security,</i>

404
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:14,031
<i> and she demanded the best.</i>

405
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,202
I hear you might be
looking for a job.

406
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,171
I might.

407
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,439
Unfortunately,

408
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,775
my employers
seem to die a lot.

409
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,276
Great.

410
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,812
And you call yourself
head of security?

411
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,247
I apologize.

412
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,282
They insisted
on coming.

413
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:36,353
Mama's little
soldiers, huh?

414
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,989
You got this, right?

415
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,091
Don't need me.

416
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,726
That's right.

417
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,194
This is just
a courtesy meeting.

418
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,296
Okay, quiet.
I swear to god,

419
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,397
if you say
another word--

420
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:48,265
It's fine.
It's fine.

421
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,934
Let them speak.
Really.

422
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,806
Well, seeing as this is
a courtesy meeting--

423
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:59,609
here's my two cents.

424
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:02,746
La Madrina isn't the only
family enterprise in town.

425
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,715
And to get to her?

426
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,117
Well, they'll find
you two in your beds

427
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,852
and cut your tongues out,

428
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,254
and you'll never
see them coming.

429
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,193
[chuckles]

430
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,396
Let's go, turds.

431
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,832
I hear you have
another brother.

432
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,044
You see?

433
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,847
Uber's not interested
in the family business.

434
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,081
I mean, look at him.

435
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,051
He wants
the blonde girlfriend

436
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,821
and to be
Mr. All-American.

437
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,595
[sniffing deeply]

438
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,366
[footsteps approaching]

439
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,333
Rudy's here, Mama.

440
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:31,234
Huh?

441
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,235
Rudy's here.

442
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,037
Oh.

443
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,008
For Carolina's birthday
tomorrow.

444
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,776
What do you think?

445
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,679
I think you've already
given her, like, five watches.

446
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,349
Good point.

447
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,487
Where's Alberto?

448
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,590
He should be on his way
to Medell�n, no?

449
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,425
He must be busy.

450
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,361
Yes... of course.

451
00:34:58,464 --> 00:34:59,629
Those girls certainly

452
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:00,997
can't pack
their big-boobed chests

453
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,699
with my<i>  coca</i>
all by themselves,

454
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,535
now, can they?

455
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,270
Mm?

456
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,220
Madrina.

457
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,755
I can truly say
the pleasure is all mine.

458
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,191
Why, look at that.

459
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:32,162
Already we agree
on something, Rodolfo.

460
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,597
Rudy.

461
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,032
I prefer Rodolfo.

462
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,668
I have
a statistics final.

463
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,903
Where is Susan,
my love?

464
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,638
You always
study together.

465
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,472
Susan?

466
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,640
My girlfriend.

467
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,175
Home.

468
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,510
Apparently she's been spending
a bit too much time

469
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:48,979
at the spic drug den.

470
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,481
The "spic drug den"?

471
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,150
Who says this?

472
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,918
Probably her dad.

473
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,286
He likes to run his mouth
after a few scotches.

474
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,755
No big deal.
I gotta go study.

475
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,690
"Spic
drug den."

476
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:13,336
Have you ever worked
for a woman before, Rodolfo?

477
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,840
Well, with all due respect...

478
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,042
no one has.

479
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,912
What I need,

480
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,480
what I require

481
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:27,017
is someone
who knows exactly what to do,

482
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,985
before
I even say it.

483
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,254
Then what you need is me.

484
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,190
Good.

485
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:36,193
Make him disappear.

486
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:39,362
Who?

487
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:42,599
That slut's father.

488
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,303
Maybe this is not the best time
for personal business.

489
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:49,005
Nobody insults
this family.

490
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,007
Nobody.

491
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,443
Calling us spics?

492
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,347
We are Colombians,
for God's sake.

493
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,991
Why are you
still standing there? Huh?

494
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:13,163
The first order I give you,
your enormous balls shrink?

495
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,434
Consider it done.

496
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,502
Yes.

497

-Not tonight, Gerry!
-Wow, whoa, whoa--

I can't listen
to anything tonight.

506

Relax, man, it's...

Did you know about this?

00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,030
What are you
talking about?

516
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,599
She had my girlfriend's dad
killed!

517

Don't you ever speak
such nonsense again!

522
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:37,814
I just signed
my own death warrant. Hmm?

This is what it feels like
to be part of a family. Huh?

No?

00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,127
Maybe...

their own testicles.

01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,401
The blonde.

926
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,072
Susan!

927
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:41,977
I saw a picture of her
in the paper.

928
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,180
She married
some football player,

929
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:47,782
already has
two little kids.

930
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:52,254
They're so adorable,
I could have eaten them up.

931
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:53,655
So cute!

932
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:05,867
[���]

933
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,469
[Uber]:
Where'd you get that,

934
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:08,737
by the way?

935
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:10,538
It's very nice.

936
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:12,874
I'm...

937
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:14,709
Oh, you know,
I'm here to collect, Tom.

938
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:16,111
Collect what?

939
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,780
You owe La Madrina
380 grand.

940
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:20,682
What are you
talking about?

941
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:22,484
She owes us.

942
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:25,553
Could that be true?

943
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:26,988
I don't know.
Maybe.

944
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,190
If you could
just... Wait.

945
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:31,760
I could show you
the bank statements that--

946
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:33,995
[gasps intensely]

947
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,731
What the hell,
man?

948
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:39,501
[Tom]: This is how she
takes care of her debts?

949
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,970
You'll rot in hell
for this!

950
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,571
It's nothing personal, Tom.

951
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:46,141
We're just trying
to get the job done.

952
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:50,045
And brother,
she wants your head too.

953
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:53,682
No, no. Uber. Uber, no.
Y-You cannot cut my head off.

954
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:54,783
Please!

955
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:56,318
Can't you just shoot me?

956
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,886
No, I can't
just shoot you.

957
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,287
That'd make
too much noise.

958
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:00,922
I got a silencer
in the car.

959
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,958
Yes. Yes,
kill me with that.

960
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,995
Fine. We'll use--
We'll use a silencer.

961
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:08,530
Thank you.

962
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:09,931
I mean, if my kids wake up
to me without a head--

963
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,467
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Your kids are here?

964
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:13,902
[Tom]:
They're sleeping.

965
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:15,470
They-- They didn't
see anything.

966
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:18,206
Tom! We're gonna have
to cancel them, too.

967
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,874
No. Please! No. Please!

968
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:21,409
We're gonna have to talk
to Madrina

969
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:22,677
before we do that.

970
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:25,213
I'm gonna talk
to La Madrina first.

971
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:29,551
Tom, I'm trying
to do you a favor here.

972
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,920
See this crazy shit?

973
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,689
You want your kids
to turn out like me?

974
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:35,724
I don't think so.

975
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,092
Here.

976
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:40,395
Sorry, man.

977
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:50,839
He's got kids upstairs
that are asleep.

978
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:52,640
And?

979
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:55,343
Well, he wants us
to spare them.

980
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,512
Oh.

981
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:03,718
What would you do?

982
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,890
I guess...

983
01:07:08,992 --> 01:07:10,625
I mean,
they're just kids.

984
01:07:11,962 --> 01:07:14,229
Yeah.

985
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:19,734
Do you know
what my favorite thing is

986
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:21,936
in<i>  Godfather II?</i>

987
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:28,109
"Don't even leave a seed."

988
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,545
Remember that?

989
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:32,814
Yeah, I think so.

990
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:34,716
Vito,

991
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:37,285
he watches his mom
get killed by, uh...

992
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,253
Don Ciccio,

993
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:39,587
when he was a boy?

994
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:43,425
Yes, and Vito escapes,
remember?

995
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:46,694
And when he becomes a man,
he...

996
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:48,596
He stabs Don Ciccio.

997
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:49,798
Yeah.

998
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,134
And he looks him in the eye
and he tells him that.

999
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,739
"Don't even

1000
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,641
leave a seed."

1001
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:06,481

1002
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,692

[���]

1007
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:19,921
The body of Christ.

1008

[���]

1009
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:33,234
My baby boy's first communion.

1010
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,671
I'm so very proud of you.

1011
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:38,406
Thank you, Mama.

1012
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:41,843
Now you have Jesus
inside of you,

1013
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:44,412
and He will protect you,

1014
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,648
just like He protects me.

1015
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,950
Yes. Amen.

1016
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:51,352
Amen.

1017
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:56,457
Sit down, my love.

1018
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:01,262

1020
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,606
My friend.

1021
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,779
How are things?

1022
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,147
[exhales deeply]

1023
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:21,316
Huh? La Madrina...

1024
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:24,452
driving you
nuts again, huh?

1025
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,154
She thinks
she's Al Capone.

1026
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,889
[chuckles]

1027
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:30,058
Smoking
five bazukos a day,

1028

putting hit lists out
on D.E.A., cops...

1029
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:35,630
Every family
wants to ice her.

1030
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,800
What do you need, Dario?

1031
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,102
To be done!

1032
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,937
I did my job.

1033
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,807
There's no controlling her
anymore.

1034
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,510
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

1035
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:52,814
She moves
too much product.

1036
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,515
She's indispensable.

1037
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:56,284
She murdered
two kids, Pablo.

1038
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:58,753
Which is unfortunate.

1039
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:02,523
She needs
to be gone.

1040
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:09,697
You're like a brother to me,
Dario.

1041
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,800
I would do anything for you,

1042
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:15,970
but not this.

1043
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,272
I would not
be running for Congress

1044
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:19,207
without her, hmm?

1045
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,881
Just keep
doing your job.

1046
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:38,459
I don't want a scratch
on her.

1047
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:40,795
Understand?

1048
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:51,472

and "Murderer's Row"
plays video games.

1051
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,256
Huh! Great.

1052
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:09,691
Suck it, Dario.

1053
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:10,925
Hey, Papa!

1054
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:14,228
Hey! Here's
my handsome boy!

1055
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:20,001
You have a kiss
for your papa?

1056
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:21,436
Wow.

1057
01:12:21,538 --> 01:12:23,171
-Look, look, look.
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1058
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:28,443
What the hell is this?

01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:33,514
That's Mikey's
birthday present.

1062
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:41,122
You gave a kid
a real gun?

[older brothers cracking up]

1064
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:43,991
Nice work,
butt brain.

1065
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:46,494
I couldn't think
of anything else.

1066
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:48,429
Hey, Papa, Papa, can I please
have some ice cream?

1067
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:49,297
Yes, of course.

1068
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:50,665
No, my love.

1069
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:55,103
You've had an ice cream
every day this week.

1070
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:58,439
Where have you been,
the last three days?

1071
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,909
You make
a lot of messes, Griselda.

1072
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:04,645
Someone
has to mop them up, no?

1073
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:07,648
I pay someone to mop.

1074
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:09,283
Try again.

1075
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,388
[scoffs]
What is this, huh?

1076
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:18,192
The "Griselda Blanco
Paranoid Hour"?

1077
01:13:18,294 --> 01:13:20,962
Have another bazuko.

1078
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,632
Watch your mouth, Dario.

Do you wanna be a hero,
baby-killer?

Come on!

Five stars.

Do I know you?

01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,999
I'm D.E.A. Agent Jimmy DiPiero,

your wife's hit list.

Well, now, you're on
there too, Dario.

1095
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:45,213
You know, I have been after her
for a very long time.

1096
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:48,716
Way before any of this, uh,
"Godmother" crap.

1097
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,185
Then I suggest

1098
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:54,021
that you find a new
line of work, then.

1099
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:56,791
You see,
that's why I'm here--

for you
to help me do my job better.

What do you want?

1102
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,867
Give her up.

1103
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:09,670

01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:17,378
I have no intentions
of joining the others.

1106
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,913
Okay?

[keeps laughing]

1108
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:24,018
Good. You know,

1109
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,653
she's gonna find out about
your little sojourn

1110
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,789
down to Medell�n.

1111
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:30,124
Then what?

1112
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:31,826
How did you know that?

1113
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,094
Listen to me.

1114
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:35,263
I can get him out.
Michael.

1115
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:38,232
Before he turns out
like his brothers.

1116
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:39,066
You can't.

1117
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:41,369
I can. I can.

1118
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:44,138
And you can start over.

1119
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,640
The two of you,
in Medell�n.

1120
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:47,441
You could have
a normal life.

1121
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:50,711
You keep your money.
We don't want it.

1122
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,749
You'll be able to afford

1123
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:57,985
all the scotch and sodas
your little heart desires.

1124
01:15:58,087 --> 01:15:59,820
It's your only way out of this.

1125
01:16:01,491 --> 01:16:03,291
By the way...

1126
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:06,627

1127
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:09,397

Let's go, man.
You've got the most--

-Yeah.
-What would Mom say, huh?

1143
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:45,533
-Yeah!
-She would say yeah?

1144
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:46,667
Yeah.

1145
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:47,602

1150
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:56,777
Hey. Go-- Go with him.

1151
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:57,979
Oh, come on.

1152
01:16:58,081 --> 01:16:58,913
The kid barely
gets to go outside.

1153
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:00,448
Let him get some
frickin' ice cream.

1154
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,550
All right.
Well, hit this right here.

1159
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,092
at the house?

1160
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:13,260
Remember those days?

1161
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:15,630
Did you guys
want some ice cream?

Our baby is gone.

Shut your mouth!

You stupid worthless
pieces of shit!

1177

You couldn't even keep an eye
on your own flesh and blood?

1178
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:03,477
Get out!

1179
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:04,945
Get out of my sight!

Shh...

1185
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:26,667
We'll turn over every stone
in this town.

1186
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:34,341
And whoever took him...

1187
01:18:38,414 --> 01:18:39,780
Listen to me.

1188
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:42,783
Whoever took him...

1189
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:47,955
Will feel 20 bullets
in their back.

1190
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,192
I promise.

1191
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:52,359
Hmm?

Right.

1199
01:19:56,826 --> 01:19:59,226
There's a van
at the gate.

1200
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:00,494
Calm down.

1201
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:01,595
It's a shipment.

1202
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:04,765
Somebody needs
to keep watching the business.

1203
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:37,932
I have something for her.

Yeah.

Thank you, Papa.

I'm so proud of you.

Come on. Let's go.

01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:05,419
Nothing.

1219
01:22:09,659 --> 01:22:11,592
I love you, Michael.

Always remember that.

Now we're going to play a game.

1223
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:30,711
Papi has to leave,
and you can't go with him.

1224
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:33,714
So you must stay in the car,

look straight ahead...

1226
01:22:38,154 --> 01:22:41,188
close your eyes,

1228
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:48,128
and don't look back.

1229
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,297
Okay.

you help me.

one phone call

to find you boys?

So how's Mom these days, huh?

1274
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:09,523
Now, I won't waste my time
asking where she is,

1275
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:11,058

No, you don't.

No, she's too smart for that.

1280

I'm guessing you don't even
know her number...

Hmm?

1282
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:26,039
Because she knows

that if I was ever across
from you spineless idiots...

Of course he will.

Legally, he goes

who never swears.

1346

Safe and very, very sound.

1347

No leverage there, James.

1348

It's Jimmy.

1349
01:33:43,018 --> 01:33:46,052
I prefer James.

Okay.

01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:50,924

Oh, a lot, apparently.

1355

right now,

1357
01:34:02,904 --> 01:34:06,840
and he is gonna be a witness
for the prosecution, Griselda.

1358
01:34:10,045 --> 01:34:11,878
You're screwed,

1359
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,047
and so are your boys.

1360
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,882

have you stand trial

1361
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,752
in Miami.

1362
01:34:18,854 --> 01:34:20,053
Why Miami?

1363
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:22,789
Well, for murder.

1364
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:26,526
The only way you get out of this
is in a pine box.

1365
01:34:28,063 --> 01:34:29,396
Unless, of course,

1366
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:30,697

01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:32,365
We are talking.

1370
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:39,272
You underestimate me.

I fear prison?

No.

1374
01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:58,458
Keep it.

1375
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,728
Consider it a gift.

1376
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:03,997
A gift?

1377
01:35:04,099 --> 01:35:06,266
No.

1378
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:08,702
Gifts are for friends.

1379
01:35:11,673 --> 01:35:15,008
Are we friends now, James?
