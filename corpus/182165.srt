1
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,266
Binh!

2
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,438
We should get married.
Our ages are well-matched.

3
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,282
You want someone
to make you dinner every day.

4
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,651
That was the idea.

5
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,384
What do I get out of it?

6
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,725
It will be a good arrangement.

7
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,465
I will be like a father to your children.

8
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:28,096
Everyone will have enough to eat,
even pig face here.

9
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,607
Why is he so grouchy?

10
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,245
If you marry me, I'll fix up the house.

11
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,521
You have to clean it!

12
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,319
Hurry!

13
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,592
I need it tonight.

14
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,441
Come!

15
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,807
Hurry! The celebration starts soon!

16
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,871
...since the liberation, significant progress
has been made in the spirit of Ho Chi Minh.

17
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,145
Will you marry Pham?

18
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,822
Who knows?

19
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,239
What did my mother say about the GI?

20
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,908
Your father?

21
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,072
Yes.

22
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,480
Why do you ask now?

23
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,623
- She must have said something.
- She cried about him.

24
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,868
That's all?

25
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,269
He had very big feet.

26
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,875
First, he tracks dirt all over the house...

27
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,213
then he takes off his leather shoes.

28
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,383
He puts up his big feet
so that everyone can see.

29
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,729
Is she alive?

30
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,007
If she marries Pham...

31
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,911
there won't be room for you.

32
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,286
She is alive.

33
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,384
In the big city.

34
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,914
- Why are you always angry with him?
- I can't bear the sight of him.

35
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,185
He's not one of us. I don't know why
he doesn't go to where he belongs.

36
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,461
And for my forefathers,
I pray for their souls...

37
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,068
and that we someday will be united.

38
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,768
For myself, I ask that my actions
will not harm others.

39
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,605
I do not leave with a bitter heart...

40
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,305
but with hope that I will have a better future.

41
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,791
You're Bui Doi, aren't you?

42
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,303
Go home. There's nothing for you here.

43
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,535
Consider yourself lucky.

44
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,041
I'm looking for Mai.

45
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,542
She used to work here.

46
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,910
She's my mother.

47
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,349
Does Mai live here?

48
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,788
Go away, beggar!

49
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,363
I know you.

50
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,944
You are very big, my brother.

51
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,741
Where is Mother?

52
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,979
She's at work...

53
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,019
in the big house.

54
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,778
If you have a problem,
don't bother our guests with it.

55
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,866
Mai! You don't work
in the dining room anymore.

56
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,793
Give me your uniform. Hurry.

57
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,623
Good evening. Do you know who I am?

58
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:57,996
It's me.

59
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,967
It's Binh.

60
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,433
I am so sorry, my son.

61
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,059
Mai.

62
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,838
Will you wait?

63
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,865
Thank you.

64
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,438
You're hungry?

65
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,402
What are you thinking?

66
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,946
I am thinking...

67
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,889
that I don't know you.

68
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,190
You know, we were married...

69
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,994
in a church.

70
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,664
He was Christian?

71
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,141
He never said...

72
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,279
but he wanted a priest.

73
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,029
Where is he? What happened to him?

74
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,961
He was here one day...

75
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,563
then he was gone.

76
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,732
Just like that.

77
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,705
Killed?

78
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,307
He was just gone.

79
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,587
It was a hard time for everyone.

80
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,648
Madam, if you have a moment.

81
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,716
It's her son.

82
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,483
He will be a good worker...

83
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,582
alongside her...

84
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,323
to replace the houseboy.

85
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,036
Far greater value than what you pay now.

86
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,802
Let me look at you.

87
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,674
Your mother is attractive.
How did you get to be so ugly?

88
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,344
I know you are generous, madam.

89
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:55,082
I know that you know
what it means to love a son, and...

90
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,051
He will shine my son's shoes.

91
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:02,256
The rugs need beating.
He can assist his mother in that.

92
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,736
And the fence has to be painted.

93
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,069
Work hard. Help your mother.

94
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,568
She's suffered a lot because of you.

95
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,054
Working hard?

96
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,493
Let me give you a hand.

97
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,672
Please, no. I must finish,
or your mother will be angry.

98
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,183
Is he Tam's father?

99
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,387
How dare you ask me that?

100
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,720
- You were gone a long time.
- I'm sorry.

101
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,226
Quiet!

102
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,930
- You have shortchanged me.
- No.

103
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,965
First he steals from me, then he lies.

104
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,276
That's what you get
for bringing such trash into the house!

105
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,255
I don't know how to protect you.

106
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,794
I have shamed you. I'll go back to Hoa Nam.

107
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,594
No. I'm proud of you.

108
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,302
Just stay out of his way.

109
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,061
Binh, help me.

110
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,939
Careful!

111
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,724
Put that down!

112
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,235
Thief! Bastard thief!

113
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,808
You must take Tam as well.

114
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,452
- Come with us, Mother!
- No.

115
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,589
I have a friend.
He knows of boats, special boats.

116
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,068
It will just be enough for the two of you.

117
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,176
This is my wedding certificate.

118
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,712
On it is an address in Houston, Texas.

119
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,873
He may help, but ask for nothing.

120
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,989
Keep a good heart.

121
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,369
Don't let Tam forget me.

122
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,178
You're going to go on a trip with Binh.

123
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,415
Mama, where will you be?

124
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,883
I'll come. Just not now.

125
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,788
Do what Binh says.

126
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,021
Mother will be along soon.
We'll all be together in America.

127
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,037
Where you going?

128
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,686
- America.
- What will you do there?

129
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,948
Sell shoes. Everyone needs shoes.

130
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,092
You have family there?

131
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,098
You have family there?

132
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,069
He's not Vietnamese.

133
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,739
He's a big American.

134
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,236
Tam, come here!

135
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,104
Tam!

136
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,403
Where were you going?

137
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,308
Where were you going?

138
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,184
- Malaysia.
- Nobody tries for Malaysia.

139
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,883
America is a nice place.

140
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,394
Have you been in prison before
for political reasons?

141
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,693
For criminal reasons?

142
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,630
Was your father American?

143
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,605
- He Vietnamese.
- Open your mouth.

144
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,242
- What is his name?
- Duc.

145
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,120
You can put your shirt on.

146
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,260
Why do you leave Vietnam?

147
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,960
It's to your benefit to tell the truth.

148
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,912
Come.

149
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,963
Don't worry. Be here when you get back...

150
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,366
just like everyone else.

151
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,366
I'll be back soon.

152
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,300
English?

153
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:14,210
Good! My English very good.
My name Chingmy.

154
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,342
- What this place?
- "What this place?" This place hell!

155
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,787
- Me Chinese. What you?
- Vietnamese.

156
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,282
Vietnamese.

157
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,224
Why you here?

158
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,505
You know, boat from China. Sink off coast.

159
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,805
Many people go underwater, too.

160
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,872
- How I leave?
- You want to leave? Good!

161
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,618
No one leaves here. No country wants you.

162
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:01,115
You grow old. God take you a better place.

163
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,564
Not yet.

164
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,765
Or you can like me. I am a very clever guy.

165
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,171
I can go under the wall.

166
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,400
- There other way?
- Sure!

167
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,703
You grow wings, you can fly over the wall.

168
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,977
Or you can like Ling.
Ling go over wall on her back.

169
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:32,978
No?

170
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,453
Oh, thank you.

171
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,755
She earn big money.
She can buy her way out!

172
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,862
If I could, I would.

173
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,262
But, you know, I'm not pretty like her.

174
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,764
You want to leave?

175
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,356
Did you buy the birthday presents?

176
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,406
Tam, time to go.
You can help me with the food.

177
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,274
No.

178
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,000
- How you come here?
- Take boat.

179
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,903
Where you go?

180
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,841
- America.
- America, huh?

181
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,282
Beautiful country.

182
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,154
You like America?

183
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,759
What you do there?

184
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,741
Sell shoe.

185
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,077

00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:06,999

One day he say to me:

"I get you out.
First, go Hong Kong. Good life. "

190
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,262
Mother still in China?

191
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,476
- More good she think I dead.

192
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,544
I shame her.

193
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,630
I'm hungry.

194
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,739
We'll try to find something to eat
after we wash.

195
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,718
I wash it for you.

196
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,102
- Why you like that?
- Like what?

197
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,507
You no look at me.

198
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,773
I look at you.

199
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,497
Never play like this.

200
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,873
Other mothers say, "No play with him.

201
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,746
"He have face of enemy. "

202
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,924
We must get out, Tam and me.

203
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,428
Leave here, take money. Big money.

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,620

00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,881
You go first.

Is Mommy on the boat?

232
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,020
Hold them there.

233
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,697
Thought you were from Miami.

234
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,174
Where'd you find these, then? In the ocean?

235
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,246
Okay, let's see the money.
Money, money, money!

236
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,985

00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,515
Good.

239
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:06,451
The passage is gonna cost $8,000,
for the three of you.

240
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,326
It's a family discount.

00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:12,061

242
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,498
In camp, they're salesmen.
I'm a businessman.

243
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,441
$2,000 each for you and the lady,
$4,000 for the kid.

244
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:25,205
Why boy no cheap? Only small.

245
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,280
Eat little.

246
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,181
He's not a worker, is he?
He just takes up space.

247
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,955
Little space.

248
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,187
Big space in your mind.

249
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,887
$2,000, 50, 60, 70...

250
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,392

00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,565
You can swim to America.
Be my guest, if that's your wish.

252
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,935
Where's the rest?

253
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,810
Have no more.

254
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,943
"Have no more?" Have no travel. Goodbye.

255
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,683
Have no more!

256
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,905
Sign your name.

257
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,774
No read Chinese.

258
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,308
You can sign your name
in whatever you want.

259
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,505
- Sign it.
- What it say?

260
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:36,948
Well, it says you'll give me $2,773 now.

261
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,113
When you get there, you'll all work,
including the kid.

262
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:44,091
If you're not lazy, you'll be free to leave
in a year. In your case, two.

263
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,821
We'll provide a place to stay,
food, and work.

264
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,902
I think you should sign.

265
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,241
Where boat going? Houston?

266
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,014
This isn't a taxi.

267
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,150
Everybody on deck.

268
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,824
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard.

269
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,867
You're our most valued passengers.

We want you to arrive healthy
and fit to work.

271

So...

272
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,544
don't fight. Don't waste food.

273
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,744
We have enough, but not enough to waste.

274
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,846
You'll all be rich in America.

275
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,652
I'm told it's easy.

276
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,288

Smells bad.

278
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,289
In America, always smell good.

279
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:59,862

280
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:03,491

281
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,899
Lots and lots of money.

282
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,729
Cleaners have big car.

283
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,464
I want to clean in America.

284
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,881
Go to back of line.

285
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,627
We pay for food.

286
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,169
You no pay me.

287
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,151
Thank you.

288
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,861
My brother need water.

289
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,326
Don't look at me, chappie.

290
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,423
Come down.

291
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,430
You think this is funny?

292
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,018
You think he's ugly?

293
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,164
Be nice.

294
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,174
Come with me.

295
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,948
Now listen to me.

296
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:45,950
These are my passengers. Mine, not yours.

297
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,424
If I lose any of them, including you...

298
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,602
I lose money.

299
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,683
Are you scared of me?

300
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,984
You know, I've been to your country.

301
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:19,619
I've been to both of your countries,
and I'll tell you something.

302
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:24,030
You will always be out of place
wherever you go.

303
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,766
Yes, I know.

304
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,431
And poor.

305
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,704
Yes, I know.

306
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:43,851
You should think about working for me.
I can give you a job.

307
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,026
- You like looking at me?
- Yes.
