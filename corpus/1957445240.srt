00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:47,371
but the other two weren't falling for it.

187
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,691
Doesn't your dad think it's weird

188
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,511
that you keep getting all
these packages in the mail?

189
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:53,141
A UFO could land in our backyard

190
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,806
and my dad wouldn't notice.

191
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:56,811
Speaking of your dad,

192
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:59,781
he told me to ask you about
getting some Halloween candy,

193
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,621
something about him being
out of town this weekend?

194
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:05,771
And that right there is why
he never notices anything.

195
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,561
He's always working.

196
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:10,641
Ever since mom died, he's never home.

197
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:13,531
And Halloween isn't
even until next Friday.

198
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:17,424
Maybe he just has a lot on his mind.

Yeah. I know.

202
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,179
That's why you're my bestie.

203
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:29,471
Thanks again for picking me up.

204
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:32,461
My car is not gonna be out of
the shop until next Tuesday.

So, how are you and Shawn?

209
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:53,286
I don't really talk to him now and

210
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,386
I need to focus on school.

211
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,538
Really though? He was so cute.

212
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,779

Oh, It's fine Clara.

219
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:32,506
So I hear you're applying

I hope you can make the grade.

00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,573
I don't need your hope,
I know what I can do.

224
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:46,406
Sorry.

225
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,701
What was that all about?
Why do you hate him so much?

226
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:54,534
He creeps me out.

227
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,301
He gives me creepy stalker vibes.

228
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,561
He's not that bad.

229
00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:59,356
Says you. I call it like I see it.

You ready for that test?

233
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,391
Honey, I was not only born fabulous,

but always on the ready.

235

Dork!

Only dork I see is the one approaching.

- See you.
- See you.

238
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,398
Quit... stop, you know I hate that.

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,041
I just can't help it.

240
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:21,375
You're so hot.

I know I am. So you
coming to my game later?

I can't, I have to work on
the trunk or treat display.

Lame. Is your dad gonna
be home this weekend?

244
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,675
We could study the human anatomy.

Hey, I'm sorry about Chad earlier.

259

He gets defensive when he's embarrassed.

260
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:27,831
It's okay, sometimes you just

261
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,671
have to turn the other cheek
on little things like that.

262
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:33,411
I'm still sorry he pushed you.

good. It has a lot of detail.

Where did you learn to do that?

programmer at Oak Ridge and

she's been teaching me

268

gonna make up for that?

She didn't want you either.

365
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:13,991
Because of you!

366
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:17,631
You're always drunk. You
gamble all of our money away.

367
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,069
Mom left because of you!

Mom knew she-

00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:24,690
You watch how you speak to me boy.

Hey Kimmy, I called that
prescription in earlier.

380
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:24,811
Oh yeah, yeah... I have that
right... right here for you.

381
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:25,644
Don't worry about it.

382
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:26,477
Thanks

383
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,310
Hey Mrs. Roberts.

384
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:30,301
Hi Clara, it's nice to see you.

385
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,031
I just have a few things to
grab, so I'll be right back.

386
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,711
Yeah, I'll just work on that right now.

387
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:34,571
What up, loser?

388
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:35,817
Hey Kimmy.

389
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:38,383
Hey

390
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:40,683
Are you still coming over tonight?

391
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:45,061
- Ugh! Do I have to?
- Yes.

392
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,151
You and Deja with me wanting
to come over all the time.

393
00:26:48,153 --> 00:26:51,071
I mean, I guess I'll come over,

394
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:52,691
but you know I have to finish up here,

395
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:54,781
just be a couple minutes, is that fine?

396
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:56,831
Could you bring some art supplies?

397

[paper bag ruffles]

398
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,411
Do I look like I have art supplies?

399
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,244
Not really.

400
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,521
What are you doing with this?

401
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:05,541
What is this? Are you
trying to check out here?

402
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:06,374
[Clara] Yes

403
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,932
This is not a checkout counter, Clara.

404
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:08,851
[Clara] Okay well...

405
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,341
This is a pharmacy counter, Clara!

406
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:12,041
[Clara] The customer's
always right, Kimmy.

407
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:16,337
You can't check out if there's
no checkout machine, Clara!

[Kimmy] ...just gonna buy
candy at my pharmacy counter..

409
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:22,178
I hate this store. I just really
want to die all the time...

410
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,548
Hi, Mrs. Robert, how are you doing?

411
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,751
Did you find everything okay?

412
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:25,584
I did thank you.

413
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:28,841
All right, let me take
care of that for you.

414
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:31,301
Okay, are you gonna be gardening today?

415
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:32,208
Hoping to get started.

416
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,071
All right, that sounds great.
Sounds like a lot of fun.

417
00:27:35,073 --> 00:27:38,201
Here's your prescription,
that's gonna be 89.95.

418
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:39,034
- All right, there you go.
- There you go.

419
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:39,981
Will you need a bag for this?

420
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:42,211
- Oh, I should be fine.
- Okay.

421
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:43,058
Thank you.

[credit card machine beeps]

423
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:45,851
Clara, will we be
seeing you and your father

424

at church this Sunday?

425
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,583
Of course. We'll definitely be there.

426
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,611
Good, it'll be really
nice to have you both back.

427
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:52,371
We missed you.

428
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,051
And thank you both for offering to help

429

with the trunk or treat

430
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,891
the children of Eden will
be so thankful, I know I am.

431
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,962
Of course, we're more
than happy to help.

432
00:27:59,964 --> 00:28:00,795
Uh huh... yeah...

433
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:02,131
Great. All right,
well, I gotta get going.

434
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:04,221
Oh, before I forget, can I get your email?

435
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:06,181
I'm gonna send you some
ideas for the display.

436
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:07,641
Okay, yeah sure. Do you have paper?

437
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,701
Mmm hmm..

438
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:09,536
Yep.

439
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,611
Really appreciate your help.

440
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,411
[Kimmy] Oh yeah... I
totally wanted to do that.

441
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,721
Great.

442
00:28:16,723 --> 00:28:17,554
Okay...

443
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:18,591
- All righty.
- Thank you.

444
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,141
I'll get that out to you tonight.

445
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:20,974
Okay. Cool.

446
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:21,861
All right. Have a good day girls.

447
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:23,684
[Kimmy] You too!

448
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,801
I don't remember volunteering for that.

449
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,411
You didn't, I volunteered you.

450
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:30,241
Okay, so how are you paying for this?

451
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,582
Cash.

452
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,041
- Oh, do you have cash?
- I do have cash.

453
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,941
[Kimmy] I'm very impressed with you.

454
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:37,331
I bet you are.

455
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,111
I will be taking that and
I will be keeping the change

456
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:42,649
'cause someone needs art supplies, right?

457
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:44,446
See you later.

pick up my prescription.

Hey hooker, you forget about me?

461
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,081
Definitely.

[low drums play]

472
00:30:07,543 --> 00:30:09,641
So Kimmy, did you know?

473
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:10,581
Did I know what?

474
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:13,801
About Clara's half naked
women she shares online.

475
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:16,671
My God, I didn't know you swung my way.

476
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:18,021
I don't.

477
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:21,411
Well, you should. Come to
the dark side we bake cookies.

478
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,981
As much as I love cookies and you Kimmy,

479
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:27,351
we both know I'm strictly dickly.

480
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:28,191
So what are you doing?

481
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,701
She cons stupid dudes for money.

482
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,541
Now, I like to think of it
as I fill one of their needs

483
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:38,151
and they fulfill my material needs.

484
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:40,353
Not my fault they're stupid.

485
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:43,231
[Kimmy lets out a long sigh]

486
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:46,251
You should really read this book.

487
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:47,631
How are they falling for this?

488
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:48,701
I mean, it's pretty simple.

489
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:50,861
I send them pictures and
they send me gift cards.

490
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,328
Everyone's happy.

491
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:56,661
So does Chad know about this?

492
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,661
No. And he isn't going to.

493
00:30:58,663 --> 00:30:59,861
I mean, they're not my pictures,

494
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:01,711
so it technically isn't even cheating.

495
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:04,461
Girl, you're pulling out
every excuse from the book.

496
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,511
Only the good ones.

497
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:09,530
Now are we gonna get started on this?

498
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:11,231
Uh... I guess...

499
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,323
What's the theme?

500
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:15,708
Um... Actually, let me check.

501
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:23,322
Looks like angels.

502
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:24,449

Hey hun? Dinner's ready.

506
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:39,931
Okay, I'll be done in a second.

507
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,421
What are you watching?

508
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,551
Oh, uh "Mean Girlz".

509
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,231
That doesn't sound like
a very wholesome film.

510
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:48,171
It's not, but it reminds
me of the kids at my school.

511
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,721
Is someone being mean to you?

512
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:52,461
No, everything's fine, I promise.

513
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:55,184
- Okay. Now go eat.
- Okay.

[upbeat music plays]

515
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,741
Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this food,

516
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,931
we pray that it will go to
the nourishment of our bodies

517

the way your word nourishes our souls.

518

We thank you for the
blessings that you granted us

519
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,711
and pray that you continue to guide us,

520
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:32,980
In Jesus name we pray, amen.

521
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,195
- Amen.
- Amen.

522
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:37,471
Did you do something
different with the potatoes?

523
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:39,673
Yes, actually. I'm
trying out a new recipe.

524

[Mr. Roberts breathes in deeply]

525
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:44,891
Well, if it tastes as
good as it looks and smells,

526
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:45,743
we have a winner.

527
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:48,086
That's sweet. Thank you.

528
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,211
Jacob have you decided whether or not

529
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:53,591
you'll be joining the
boys youth group trip

530
00:32:53,593 --> 00:32:55,251
for winter break?

531
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,169
I hear they have a great time.

532
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,251
I don't know, I'm
not really into skiing,

533
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:04,601
but some of the boys
talked about the Aquarium.

534
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:05,961
Oh the Aquarium?

535
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:06,794
That's where your mother and I

536
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:09,081
went on our anniversary last time.

537
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,551
I think you'll like that.

538
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:14,141
Penguins are my favorite.
They're just adorable.

539
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:17,031
You say that about all
of God's animals though.

540
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:17,866
Yes she does.

541
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:22,340
Yes. That's because I
love all God's creations.

542
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:24,491
Betty, that is not what
you said about that snake

543
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,533
we found on the shade last fall. [laughs]

544
00:33:27,535 --> 00:33:28,541
[Mrs. Roberts shudders]

545
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:31,451
Okay, maybe most of God's creations,

546
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,236
just not the slithering kind.

547
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:37,051
Besides it reminds me of
the serpent in Genesis.

548
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:38,066
Just evil.

549
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:43,744
Now, hon. Even the serpent
has a purpose in God's plan.

550
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,244
That's true.

551
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:48,990
What about you honey?

552
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,759
Have you finished your
sermon for Sunday yet?

553
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,706
Um... not quite...

559
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,521
Hey hon.

560
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:08,002
Hey, beautiful. What's up?

561
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:10,241
How long you gonna be?

562
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:13,383
Not long, just got a
little bit more to go.

563
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:16,501
What's your topic this Sunday?

564
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:17,871
Temptation.

565
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:20,001
I figured with the holidays
just around the corner,

566
00:35:20,003 --> 00:35:22,126
temptation is gonna be in abundance.

567
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:28,033
- Mr.Roberts?
- Yes.

568
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:30,351
Might I tempt you into coming to bed?

569
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:34,141
Mrs. Roberts, are you coming on to me?

570
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,726
What, I'm just fulfilling
my wifely duties.

571
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,188
Maybe I can show you what that entails.

572
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:42,420
Amen.

573
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:49,102

576
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,577
[Mr. Roberts] Hey Jacob,

577
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:34,182
could you come help me out for a minute?

578
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:38,992
[gentle music]

579
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:54,163
Oh Frank, always forgetting
to shut down your computer.

580
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:59,107
[gentle music]

581
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,166

[Mrs. Roberts sighs]

586
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:13,259
[Mrs. Roberts is chopping oranges loudly]

587
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:28,521
Well, that smells great, hon.

588
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,548
You left computer on again.

589
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,381
Hmm..I did? My mind was a
little distracted last night.

590
00:38:37,443 --> 00:38:40,161
Did you get a chance to look
over my sermon for tomorrow?

591
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:44,341
Yes, I did. It was insightful.

592
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,891
Still have a few tweaks to make on it,

593
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,466
but I think it'd be a great sermon.

594
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,030
Maybe you should take
your own sermon's advice.

595
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,124
I'm sorry hon, what was that?

596
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,951
Just that I hope the weather's nice.

597
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:02,923
I really wanted to prune the
roses before our first frost.

598
00:39:03,763 --> 00:39:06,630
The weatherman says it's
gonna be sunny and 72º today.

599
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:08,673
That's good to know.

600
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,031
I'm going to go wash up before I eat.

601
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:26,516

[Mrs. Roberts weeps]

603
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:43,461
Hey mom, can I borrow
the laptop for a project?

604
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,013
Yeah it's fine. I don't care.

605
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,568
Are you okay?

606
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:50,073
Yeah honey, I'm fine.

607
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,326
Got some soap in my eyes. Silly, I know.

608
00:39:56,173 --> 00:39:58,246
Your breakfast is ready
for you in the kitchen.

609
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:00,311
I'm gonna eat in my room.

610
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:01,813
I wanna get this project done.

611
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:07,091
That's fine. Can you help
me in the garden later?

612
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:07,932
Sure thing.

613
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:12,934

[medicine bottle rattling]

615
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,251
[Deja] We've looked at so many of these

616
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:35,696
I'm becoming cross-eyed.

617
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:37,791
I thought that was just your face.

618
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:41,561
Shut up. Seriously
Clara can we just wing it?

619
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:44,804
- Well, aren't you just punny?
- I thought so.

620
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:47,351
- [email chimes]
- What's that?

621
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,064
It's just a new message.

622
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:52,141
- Uh huh, I wanna see.
- Yeah, me too.

623
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:52,974
Fine.

624
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,401
Anything has to be better
than this current craft hell.

625
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:58,734
- Oh, he's thinking of you.
- Uh, shut up.

626
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:00,181
Give me.

627
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:03,671
Oh my gosh, what are you typing?

628
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:04,878
You'll see.

629
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:09,431
Done and sent.

630
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,671
Good Lord, let's see what you wrote.

631
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:15,591
You scandalous hussy.

632
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:17,741
You wrote it like an erotica novel.

633
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:18,574
I'm scandalous?

634
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,465
She's the one who's been
stringing him along.

635
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:21,634
Ugh...

636
00:41:21,636 --> 00:41:26,636
I'm thinking of you. I wanna
put your hands on my body

637
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:31,637
and your lips on mine and put your member?

638
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,895
Member?!?

639
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:35,921
Really, really that's
what you're focusing on.

640
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:37,721
I mean, it's just weird.

641
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:38,661
Just like you.

642
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,791
Come on ladies, we need
to focus on why we came here

643
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:44,521
and that is to make a heavenly display.

644
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:46,521
Fine, but I still
have glitter stuck to me

645
00:41:46,523 --> 00:41:47,761
from last night.

646
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:51,401
Glerpies. Glerpies.
You have glitter herpes.

647
00:41:51,403 --> 00:41:54,009
Come on! We're never
gonna get this done!

648
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,041

650
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:02,046
Oh, it looks like he wants
to use that member in person.

651
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,749
He said he can make your
dreams into a reality.

652
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:09,569
Oh Girl, he wants to be
the new member in your club.

653
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:11,861
Mmm. Uh uh. Shut up.

654
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,851
- You're blushing!
- No, I'm not.

655
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:15,006
Yeah you are.

656
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:19,006
You're a virgin.

657
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,984
No, she's slept with Chad before.

658
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:28,986
I mean, we've done
things. Just not that.

659
00:42:30,452 --> 00:42:32,374
Hmm... that's not what I heard.

660
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:34,591
What did you hear?

661
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,331
- Don't make me tell her!
- Just tell me!

662
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:40,641
Fine. Just don't shoot the messenger.

663
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:43,861
Chad said that he slept with you

664
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:45,771
under the football bleachers.

665
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:49,181
- What?
- Are you okay?

666
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:52,781
No! How could he do that?!?

667
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,091
What are you going to do?

- I just dumped him.
- Really?

673
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:14,043
Yeah. I can't believe
he would do that to me.

674
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,995
He wasn't good enough for you anyway.

675

I feel so dumb.

00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:21,221
I mean, don't feel
dumb, it's not your fault.

677
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:25,794

for losing you, I guess.

could Uber with you though.

that we can overcome temptation.

903
01:00:30,933 --> 01:00:33,821
Now, let us pray.

904
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:34,923
Please bow your heads.

905
01:00:36,253 --> 01:00:38,776
Heavenly Father we come before you now...

906
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:47,351
We're so glad you and
your dad could make it.

907
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:48,184
- I know.
- What?

[ominous music]

909
01:00:49,453 --> 01:00:52,561
Mrs. Roberts, you're hurting me.

910
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:55,680
I'm sorry, I guess I just
don't know my grasp sometimes.

911
01:00:55,682 --> 01:00:58,721
I just meant that I know
I'll be seeing more of you...

912
01:00:58,723 --> 01:00:59,851
Yeah.

913
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:02,191
Helping out with the trunk
or treat this Thursday!

914
01:01:02,193 --> 01:01:04,666
Of course, definitely.

915
01:01:04,668 --> 01:01:07,713
Um... I'm gonna go catch
up with my dad now.

916
01:01:07,715 --> 01:01:08,981
You should probably go catch up.

917
01:01:08,983 --> 01:01:10,251
Yeah.

918
01:01:10,253 --> 01:01:11,609
Good to see you.

919
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:14,233

Hey Dej. What's up?

928
01:01:46,643 --> 01:01:48,711
[Deja] Not much just bored.

929
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:53,121
Same. So going back to
church today felt really weird.

930
01:01:53,123 --> 01:01:54,211
[Deja] Yeah, I agree.

931
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:57,081
You should have seen the
look on Mrs. Robert's face.

932
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:59,473
If looks could kill, you'd be dead.

Um... Mrs. Roberts really
creeped me out today.

937
01:02:10,483 --> 01:02:14,442
Usually she's so sweet,
but today she seemed off.

938
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:16,316
[Deja] That whole family's off.

939
01:02:17,522 --> 01:02:19,211
Super nice people creep me out.

940
01:02:19,213 --> 01:02:21,771
Nobody can be that nice all the time.

941
01:02:21,773 --> 01:02:24,801
I guess. Are you still
coming over tonight?

942
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:26,465
Dad's heading out of town soon.

943
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:29,259
[Deja] Yeah, once my mom
picks me up with the car.

944
01:02:29,261 --> 01:02:31,166
Okay. See you later then.

945
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,168

Shhhhh!

01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:55,601
Did you know that in Australia

01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:58,441
they have an actual swooping season?

It's just the pizza. I
completely forgot about it.

01:03:24,987 --> 01:03:28,351
Oh, hey, could you come inside

958
01:03:28,353 --> 01:03:29,803
so you don't let the bugs in?

959
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:34,411
Sure, didn't know you lived here.

960
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:36,384
I didn't know you delivered pizzas.

961
01:03:36,386 --> 01:03:40,081
My parents wanted me to learn
more about responsibility,

962
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,981
so... now I have a job.

963

971
01:04:14,883 --> 01:04:18,011
You'll never guess who
delivered our pizzas.

01:04:18,013 --> 01:04:18,846
Who?

973
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:21,251
Jacob.

974
01:04:21,253 --> 01:04:24,091
Really? I never pictured
him as a delivery boy.

975
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,847
Well, what did you picture him as?

did you guys hear that?

It's probably the birds
coming to end us all.

981
01:04:38,463 --> 01:04:39,931
Very funny.

982
01:04:39,933 --> 01:04:41,791
I am funny... I'm really funny.

983
01:04:43,023 --> 01:04:44,503

That.

It's probably just a twig or something.

987
01:04:49,443 --> 01:04:51,026
Or a bird.

you just call the cops?

No, it wasn't him.

- I just do.

about to say the same thing.

I have worked in the morning.

ain't got none anyway.

Are you okay?

1059
01:08:11,223 --> 01:08:12,863
No, I'm not.

1060
01:08:12,865 --> 01:08:16,251
Okay. Why don't you come
and take a walk with me

1061
01:08:16,253 --> 01:08:19,321
and we can talk where
there's less prying eyes.

1062
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:20,156
Come on.

1063
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:28,871

and talk on that bench, okay?

01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,510
Come on, we have a seat.

1067
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,580
Do you wanna tell me what happened?

1068
01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:05,729
It's embarrassing.

1069
01:09:08,063 --> 01:09:10,278
I can't help you if you don't let me in.

1070
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:13,301
I do want to help.

1071
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:27,161
But there's nothing covered
up that will not be revealed

1072
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,863
and hidden that will not be known.

1073
01:09:30,143 --> 01:09:30,976
What?

bottom of the picture,

Luke 12:2.

What does it mean?

1077
01:09:38,604 --> 01:09:41,431
Well, Clara, it looks
like somebody thinks

1078
01:09:41,433 --> 01:09:43,183
you have a secret they want shared.

1079
01:09:44,593 --> 01:09:45,911
Do you have a secret, Clara?

1080
01:09:45,913 --> 01:09:47,741
What? No!

1081
01:09:47,743 --> 01:09:49,661
Why does it even matter?

1082
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:51,381
Somebody took my picture

1083
01:09:51,383 --> 01:09:53,596
and shared it without my permission.

1084
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,129
I'm gonna go call my dad.

1085
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:58,776

abomination to the Lord.

[Mr. Banks] Honey, did
Chad take these photos?

1089
01:10:12,283 --> 01:10:14,204
No, I don't know who did it.

1090
01:10:14,206 --> 01:10:15,662
[Mr. Banks] Okay, well
I'm literally rushing to

1091
01:10:15,664 --> 01:10:17,531
check out of the hotel now and head home.

1092
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:20,171
No, you don't need to rush home

1093
01:10:20,173 --> 01:10:22,646
but can you call the school?

1094
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,241
I can't go back there.

1095
01:10:26,243 --> 01:10:28,321
[Mr. Banks]
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1096
01:10:28,323 --> 01:10:30,746
Okay, thanks.

1097
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:32,448
[Mr. Banks] - We'll figure
this out, sweetheart.

1098
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:37,615
I love you. Be safe and
you remember you call me

1099
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:39,821
if anything else happens, okay?

1100
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:41,986
Okay. I'll see you Thursday.

Yes you are.

Come in.

1118
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,401
- You all right?
- No, I'm mortified.

1119
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:31,689
I can never show my face there again.

1120
01:12:32,963 --> 01:12:35,533
We could get you a mask.

1121
01:12:35,535 --> 01:12:38,211
- You're not helping.
- Sorry.

1122
01:12:38,213 --> 01:12:40,162
Just trying to lighten up the mood.

1123
01:12:40,164 --> 01:12:43,600
I, um...

1124
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:45,830
- got your homework.
- Thanks.

1125
01:12:48,593 --> 01:12:49,981
What did your dad say?

1126
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:52,851
Honestly, it was like an interrogation.

1127
01:12:52,853 --> 01:12:53,684
Really?

1128
01:12:53,686 --> 01:12:57,051
Yeah. It seems like everybody's
pointing the finger at me.

1129
01:12:57,053 --> 01:12:59,001
It's not like I asked for this.

1130
01:12:59,003 --> 01:13:01,031
Who's pointing the finger at you, Clara?

1131
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:04,071
Just stop, okay?

1132
01:13:04,073 --> 01:13:07,096
It's it's fine..just..I want to be alone!

1133
01:13:08,113 --> 01:13:09,996
All right, then I'll go.

1134

Deja wait, wait come back.

1135
01:13:16,153 --> 01:13:20,271
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.

1136
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:21,971
It's okay, I get it.

1137
01:13:21,973 --> 01:13:25,051
I would want to be alone
after a day like today.

1138
01:13:25,053 --> 01:13:27,691
Thank you for bringing me my homework.

1139
01:13:27,693 --> 01:13:28,776
No problem.

1140
01:13:29,813 --> 01:13:31,161
You still want me to
come with you tomorrow

1141
01:13:31,163 --> 01:13:32,451

1142

I don't know.

1177
01:19:16,163 --> 01:19:17,666

I'm at 1975 Hallow
Drive, um, someone has...

1182
01:19:27,943 --> 01:19:29,641
You think it was a prank?

1183
01:19:29,643 --> 01:19:30,981
No, I don't.

1184
01:19:30,983 --> 01:19:31,814
All right, ladies,

1185
01:19:31,816 --> 01:19:34,251
it looks like everything's clear in there.

1186
01:19:34,253 --> 01:19:36,161
If you guys have anything
else you'd like to add,

1187
01:19:36,163 --> 01:19:38,371
just feel free to call
down to the station.

1188

- Um... okay?
- All right. Thank you.

Bye.

1190
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:48,621
Seriously, that didn't
make me feel any better.

1191
01:19:48,623 --> 01:19:50,261
I thought they would've
had the whole team out here

1192

searching for fingerprints.

1193
01:19:51,443 --> 01:19:53,311
I guess that just happens on TV.

Are you gonna call your dad?

1195
01:19:54,953 --> 01:19:55,951
There's no point.

1196
01:19:55,953 --> 01:19:57,371
He'll probably just think it was a prank

1197
01:19:57,373 --> 01:19:58,641
just like the stupid cops.

1198
01:19:58,643 --> 01:20:00,481
I guess, but don't you think it's weird

1199
01:20:00,483 --> 01:20:02,331

1200

You sure you didn't attract a stalker?

1201
01:20:04,903 --> 01:20:06,862
That's not possible,
how would they find me?

Of course, I'd love to.

We really wouldn't wanna
take up too much of your time,

1215
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:45,281
but thank you so much.

1216

He's such a pig.

1227
01:21:32,813 --> 01:21:34,463
I just wanna get my car and go.

1228
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:36,776
I got this.

1229
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:43,011
Are you serious? Why
are you so lame, Chad?

1230
01:21:43,013 --> 01:21:44,601
Why you got to be such a bitch, Deja?

1231
01:21:44,603 --> 01:21:46,351
At least I don't pretend to get action.

I'm gonna go bring it to her.
I'll be back in a minute.

Wow. So you dating this Jesus freak now?

Yeah, it's along the
side of the building.

the side of the building.

01:23:02,053 --> 01:23:04,321
Yeah. I tripped on the way back here.

1256
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:07,091
Hon, you got something on your shirt.

1257

[Reporter] It's 5:30. This is Tim chase.

1263
01:23:39,453 --> 01:23:41,591
The Eden Police Department
is investigating

1264
01:23:41,593 --> 01:23:44,691
the second murder to occur
within the last seven days.

1265
01:23:44,693 --> 01:23:46,441
A spokesperson for the department said,

1266
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:48,871
it's the first time in 22 years

1267
01:23:48,873 --> 01:23:51,221
that back-to-back murders have occurred.

1268
01:23:51,223 --> 01:23:52,801
Now they state there's no cause

1269
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:55,261
to think the murders
are in any way related?

1270
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,251
Well, we'll just have to
take their word on that,

1271
01:23:57,253 --> 01:23:59,871
but keep your doors locked
tonight, Eden. Be safe.

1272

He was just foul back there.

that would wanna hurt you?

I mean recently my
boyfriend Chad, and I broke up

1328
01:27:29,523 --> 01:27:32,807
and he did send me a text
saying that I would regret it.

1329
01:27:32,809 --> 01:27:33,640
What?

1330
01:27:33,642 --> 01:27:35,881
Is this the same Chad
that works at the garage

1331
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:37,461
that recently worked on your vehicle?

1332
01:27:37,463 --> 01:27:38,486
Yes.

1333
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:40,173
You didn't think to tell me about that?

1334
01:27:40,175 --> 01:27:41,442
Dad... it's fine.

1335
01:27:43,203 --> 01:27:44,036
Okay.

1336
01:27:44,953 --> 01:27:47,011
Well, Ms. Banks, I think
that's all we need for now.

1337
01:27:47,013 --> 01:27:47,844
No, it's not.

1338
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,561
You're gonna go arrest
this guy, aren't you?

1339
01:27:49,563 --> 01:27:51,641
Mr. Banks first, we have
to question everyone involved

1340
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:53,751
to further our investigation.

Mr. Banks though I do
understand your anger,

1344
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,591
please understand that we have to review

Do you even know why you
were brought in today?

I don't know.

1359
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:43,221
Maybe because my ex is a bitch

that whines over stupid shit.

1361
01:28:45,203 --> 01:28:46,791
You think what happened was stupid?

1362

Yeah, since when was dog shit on fire

1363
01:28:49,603 --> 01:28:51,991
and a mouse prank
warrant an interrogation?

1364
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,376
Chad shut your mouth.

1365
01:28:54,253 --> 01:28:57,341
Listen, if you wanna charge
my son with anything,

1366
01:28:57,343 --> 01:28:58,971
you can speak with our lawyer.

son with anything, yet.

lawyer, no one's stopping you.

- Son I know. Are we done yet?

can talk to me, right?

01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,523
We should add her to our prayer list.

I'll pray she stays
away from my husband.

01:44:01,893 --> 01:44:04,931
Yeah. You know, when people
used to go door to door.

1607
01:44:04,933 --> 01:44:07,006
Mom says this is much safer.

1608
01:44:09,444 --> 01:44:10,277
I guess.

1609
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:20,606
[ominous music]

1610
01:44:24,773 --> 01:44:26,386
You wanna see me die...

1611
01:44:27,313 --> 01:44:28,146
don't you?

1612
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:35,206
You wanna watch me bleed.

1613
01:44:36,752 --> 01:44:37,789
[laughs manically]

1614
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:38,624
What?

1615
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:47,252
[tense music]

1616
01:44:47,254 --> 01:44:48,504
[giggles manically]

1617
01:44:51,559 --> 01:44:52,392
Uh...

1618
01:44:54,013 --> 01:44:55,789
Hey! We're out of candy.

1619
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,993
I... um...

1620
01:45:01,813 --> 01:45:03,516
I'll be right there.

1621
01:45:12,893 --> 01:45:17,656
Mrs. Roberts, we were wondering
if we could go see Kimmy?

1622
01:45:18,993 --> 01:45:21,926
Yeah. It's fine, thanks for your help.

1623
01:45:23,973 --> 01:45:25,351
Where are they going?

1624
01:45:25,353 --> 01:45:26,937
To check on Kimmy.

1625
01:45:26,939 --> 01:45:28,331
Is she okay?

1626
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:30,071
Well, she's supposed to be here today

1627
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,823
and they still haven't heard from her.

1628
01:45:33,673 --> 01:45:36,815
I can stop at Clara's later
and check in on her, okay?

1629
01:45:42,343 --> 01:45:45,951
Oh, Hey Micah, can you pack
this up in the van for me?

1630
01:45:45,953 --> 01:45:47,361
Sure.

1631
01:45:47,363 --> 01:45:48,581
Hey, thanks for your help today.

1632
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:49,416
No problem.

1633
01:45:50,812 --> 01:45:55,528
[gentle music]

1634
01:45:59,877 --> 01:46:00,827

1635
01:46:05,414 --> 01:46:10,322
[suspenseful music]

1636
01:46:16,843 --> 01:46:18,571
Shit! Dude.

1637
01:46:18,573 --> 01:46:19,901
Didn't mean to scare you,

1638
01:46:19,903 --> 01:46:22,351
mom wanted to know if you needed a ride.

1639
01:46:22,353 --> 01:46:23,746
No, I'm okay.

1640
01:46:24,991 --> 01:46:26,001
Are you sure?

1641
01:46:26,003 --> 01:46:28,541
Yeah... I uh, I think I'll walk.

1642
01:46:28,543 --> 01:46:29,919
It's nice night for a walk.

1643
01:46:29,921 --> 01:46:34,349
[gentle music]

1644
01:46:34,351 --> 01:46:36,401
[Clara] I can't
believe Kimmy ditched us.

1645
01:46:36,403 --> 01:46:38,081
[Deja] She probably
didn't wanna be caught dead

1646
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:39,611
in this angel costume.

1647
01:46:39,613 --> 01:46:40,733
I guess...

1648
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:44,669
You sure you don't want
to go to the party with me?

1649
01:46:44,671 --> 01:46:47,764
[Clara] Yeah, I think
I'll just stay home.

1650
01:46:47,766 --> 01:46:50,081
All right. I'll head out then.

1651
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:51,811
Okay. Be safe.

1652
01:46:51,813 --> 01:46:54,241
I will. Call me if you change your mind.

1653
01:46:54,243 --> 01:46:55,076
I will.

1654
01:47:01,983 --> 01:47:05,384
Dad, are you home?

1655
01:47:11,949 --> 01:47:16,941

[ominous music]

1658
01:47:51,323 --> 01:47:55,571
I guess those masks are popular this year.

1659
01:47:58,363 --> 01:48:01,416
Aren't you a little too old
to be trick or treating?

1660
01:48:01,418 --> 01:48:06,393
[tense music]

1661
01:48:10,211 --> 01:48:11,901
You know what?

1662
01:48:11,903 --> 01:48:15,866
It's whatever, we have candy left anyway.

1663
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:21,806

1666
01:48:30,493 --> 01:48:34,451
Oh, ha ha. You're so scary.

1667
01:48:34,453 --> 01:48:38,210
Just take the candy and go.

1668
01:48:38,212 --> 01:48:40,471
Let go of me, what are you doing?

1669
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:45,006
Let go of... [screams]

1670

When you get to the hospital,

1723
01:55:06,353 --> 01:55:08,381
you are gonna have to have stitches, okay?

1724
01:55:08,383 --> 01:55:09,216
Okay.

1725
01:55:13,213 --> 01:55:14,246
Here you go, sweetie.

1726
01:55:18,943 --> 01:55:20,131
This is to help you, okay?

1727
01:55:20,133 --> 01:55:20,964
Until you get to the hospital.

1728
01:55:20,966 --> 01:55:23,270
They will
get you another.

1729
01:55:23,272 --> 01:55:24,103
Alright?

1730
01:55:24,105 --> 01:55:24,938
Okay.

1731
01:55:30,313 --> 01:55:32,321
Why are you here, Micah?

1732
01:55:32,323 --> 01:55:36,591
I found something in the
back of Mrs. Roberts' van...

1733
01:55:36,593 --> 01:55:37,843
there were photos of you.

1734
01:55:38,813 --> 01:55:40,366
I thought you should know about it.

1735
01:55:42,483 --> 01:55:44,531
Were you the one that
knocked on my door?

1736
01:55:44,533 --> 01:55:47,571
No, I was on your front
step and I rang the doorbell.

1737
01:55:47,573 --> 01:55:50,921
And next thing I know there's
a pain in the back of my head,

1738
01:55:50,923 --> 01:55:52,146
and I woke up in the bush.

1739
01:55:53,172 --> 01:55:56,430
I would have never thought
Mrs. Roberts was... violent.

1740

1747
01:56:35,543 --> 01:56:38,111
[Reporter] For WGET, I'm Tim Chase.

1748
01:56:38,113 --> 01:56:40,761
Authorities this morning are
investigating a horrific scene

1749
01:56:40,763 --> 01:56:43,071
that occurred late last
night on Hallow Drive.

1750
01:56:43,073 --> 01:56:44,791
An Eden police departments spokesperson

1751
01:56:44,793 --> 01:56:46,981
said 18-year-old Clara
Banks of Eden, Tennessee

1752
01:56:46,983 --> 01:56:49,951
was attacked by Betty
Roberts, 42, also of Eden.

1753
01:56:49,953 --> 01:56:51,761
Ms. Banks suffered multiple stab wounds,

1754
01:56:51,763 --> 01:56:53,261
but was able to fend off her attacker,

1755
01:56:53,263 --> 01:56:55,021
which led to the death of Roberts.

1756
01:56:55,023 --> 01:56:56,891
Betty Roberts had no prior arrest record

1757
01:56:56,893 --> 01:56:58,031
nor history of violence,

1758
01:56:58,033 --> 01:57:00,121
but sources tell us she
is now the prime suspect

1759
01:57:00,123 --> 01:57:02,761
in two murders that occurred
earlier this week in Eden.

1760
01:57:02,763 --> 01:57:03,971
In a related story,

1761
01:57:03,973 --> 01:57:05,781
authorities are beginning
a search this morning

1762
01:57:05,783 --> 01:57:06,911
for Kimmy Nichols.

1763
01:57:06,913 --> 01:57:10,821
Nichols, 20 of Eden, went
missing the day before Halloween.

1764
01:57:10,823 --> 01:57:12,671
Nichols is a close friend of
Clara Banks [faintly speaking]

1765
01:57:12,673 --> 01:57:14,447
and attends Oak Ridge state college.

1766

So tox screening analysis
of Mrs. Roberts revealed

1769
01:57:25,303 --> 01:57:27,203
that she'd been given
the wrong medication...

1770
01:57:28,703 --> 01:57:30,706
resulting in severe side effects.

1771
01:57:31,703 --> 01:57:33,891
After looking at the deceased'
computer we found emails

1772
01:57:33,893 --> 01:57:36,240
sent to your daughter's email address.

1773
01:57:36,242 --> 01:57:38,631
It seems Mrs. Roberts had been
fixated on you for some time,

1774
01:57:38,633 --> 01:57:40,791
probably the result of the medication.

1775
01:57:40,793 --> 01:57:45,094
Side effects included paranoia,
hallucination, agitation...

01:58:12,845 --> 01:58:13,769
