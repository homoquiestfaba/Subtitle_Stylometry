1
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,954
One, two, three...

2
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,426
Hold up.

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,221
Here's the story about a man

4
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,732
A simple man

5
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,402
A man with a dream
To do the world some good

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,072
Here's a story for rich and poor

7
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,267
For young and for old

8
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,772
About a man from the 'hood
Trying to do the world some good

9
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,310
Here's the story about a man

10
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,652
An everyday man

11
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,089
A man with a dream

12
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,318
To be the head of state

13
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,694
Alderman Gilliam's office.
What are you upset about?

14
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,031
It's not a black-owned business?

15
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,595
- But it's a Chinese food restaurant.
- So, what's with the fried rice?

16
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,835
I know it's fried rice, but it's not "fried" rice.

17
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,901
Alderman Gilliam's office.

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,277
Kim. How is it going, honey?

19
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,975
- Got tickets to the symphony.
- Really?

20
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,713
- Hold on a second, I got another call.
- You better not put me on hold.

21
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,347
Vote for Gaines and James.

22
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,257
- The Million Babies Mamas March?
- It's a very good cause.

23
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,795
Call Reverend Barton for that one. No...

24
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,390
you can't use food stamps to buy tires.

25
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,068
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawkins.
What can I do for you?

26
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,604
Your girlfriend is on hold.

27
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,935
- Hold on a second.
- How could you put me on hold?

28
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,805
- What was it, Mr. Hawkins?
- The bus.

29
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,573
I read that they're going to shut down
our bus line.

30
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,978
If they do that, I can't get to work!

31
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,846
Unless they give me a job
in that new mall they're building.

32
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,648
Don't worry. I've been talking
to the people downtown...

33
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,245
and I promise you this:

34
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,985
If they shut down this bus line,
I will drive you to work myself.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,952
You got my word.

36
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,660
Alderman Gilliam, quick! Miss Pearl is back!

37
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,131
Okay. I got to go.

38
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:58,310
Hi, that's me, Mays Gilliam, alderman
of the 9th Ward of Washington, D.C.

39
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,909
Not the part of D.C. you're familiar with.

40
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,178
I work in a neighborhood so bad,
you can get shot while you're getting shot.

41
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:09,785
Around here when people have a problem,
they don't call the mayor, they call me.

42
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,955
Miss Pearl!

43
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,223
What's going on?

44
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,771
Dionne is in the house. I know she is.

45
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,808
I don't know what she's talking about.
We checked the house, nobody is in there.

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,969
Hey, man, Dionne is her cat.

47
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,707
Whatever. Cats got nine lives. She'll be fine.

48
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,614
Can we let one guy go in
and help this lady get her cat?

49
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,017
Can't do it. Once they laid the explosives,
there's nothing I can do.

50
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,145
She just showed up.

51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,350
You took the lady's house.
Can you at least let her get her cat?

52
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,484
We didn't take it, we gave her $40,000.

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,360
What kind of house is she supposed to get
with $40,000? A crack house?

54
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,661
I think she'd be happy to get out
of this rattrap.

55
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,258
Who are you to call this place a rattrap?

56
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,567
This is my neighborhood, where I'm from.
I got my first bike stolen right there.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,767
My daddy got his bike stolen right there.

58
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,971
When I have a son, I hope he's fortunate
enough to get stuck up right there.

59
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,742
- Can't you let somebody go check?
- We already looked.

60
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,046
There's nothing in there. We got work to do.

61
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,847
Leave the people alone, damn it!

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,683
- Let's get this thing going.
- Come on.

63
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,553
- Stop being in such a hurry.
- We've been here all morning.

64
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,525
Let the lady go inside.

65
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,494
Come on, baby! Sugar baby.

66
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,095
Could you at least turn it off?
Let the lady get her cat.

67
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,602
Dionne, baby? I got something for you!

68
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,002
Miss Pearl, no!

69
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,806
All right, turn it off.
Wait till this woman gets her cat.

70
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,402
Shit, it's not working!

71
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,641
Turn it off!

72
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,515
She better get out, it's going to blow!

73
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,252
Miss Pearl! Come out!

74
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,444
No, Mays!

75
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,854
You've only got a minute!

76
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,822
- Fix it! Get to work.
- I'm trying.

77
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,665
Get a union man on this.

78
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,792
Get your ass out!

79
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,832
Miss Pearl, we got to get out of here.
They're going to blow this place up.

80
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,946
They wouldn't do that, baby!
They know we're in here.

81
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,211
I love you, I've known you a long time.
You've seen a lot in your life.

82
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,276
You've seen churches burnt to the ground,
dogs sicced on kids...

83
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,584
you've seen Malcolm X and JFK killed.

84
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,715
They shut up Muhammad Ali
and Richard Pryor.

85
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,488
They gave Magic Johnson AIDS,
turned Michael Jackson white.

86
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,860
Do you really think these people
give a damn about you?

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,746
We interrupt the Jay-Z song
to bring you this special bulletin.

88
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,916
Presidential candidate Senator Gaines...

89
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,856
and his running mate,
General Olson James...

90
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,919
were both killed when their planes
crashed into each other.

91
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,124
We now return you to the Jay-Z song
already in progress.

92
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,041
What's up?

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,453
Trying to be like you, hero!
What's up, man? Saving kittens?

94
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,956
Don't steal my car now.

95
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:36,085
I don't want that garbage.
What will I do, feed your car to my car?

96
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,759
Let me get ten Nine Lives,
four Lucky Ducks, two Straight Pokers...

97
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,994
three Crabpots and five Powerballs.

98
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,703
Thank you, here you go.

99
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,904
You all need to stop.

100
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,214
Why are all these people clapping?

101
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,880
- You didn't see me on the news?
- No, I didn't.

102
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,023
I got meat!

103
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,787
More beef than East Coast, West Coast rap.
Check it out!

104
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,060
Superman! Saving lives and stuff.

105
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,361
Why don't you cop
one of these pork chops?

106
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,665
Know what you need to do?
You need to leave. I won't tell you again.

107
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,103
Nobody wants your meat.
Who the hell wants to buy stolen meat?

108
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,574
- I'll take a T-bone.
- You like gizzards, too?

109
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,209
Did you hear about that guy
running for President?

110
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,909
Who will replace him?

111
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,884
Maybe they should get Shaq.
Nobody can beat him.

112
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,353
Are you getting gas?
You're holding my line up.

113
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,787
Yeah, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,718
$10 on three.

115
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,871
You've got a lot of nerve hanging up on me.

116
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,031
Hanging up?

117
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,472
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving you! That's what's going on.

118
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,309
The only reason I accepted this engagement
ring from you in the first place...

119
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,247
is because I thought you had potential!

120
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,581
I thought you wanted more!

121
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,287
Why can't you just play the game?
Wear a suit!

122
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,455
Be a real politician!

123
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,824
What's my clothes have to do with...
Are you seeing somebody else?

124
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm seeing everybody else!

125
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,631
I've met mosquitoes
with more force than you.

126
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,660
I'm tired of your little games,
tired of being your little secretary.

127
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,830
Here's the light bill. I didn't pay it.

128
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,374
Here's the cable bill. I didn't pay that, either.

129
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,071
And here's the bill for your car note.

130
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,142
I hope they take it!

131
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,145
Wait a minute, that's my car!

132
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,918
Wait, come back!

133
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,848
I hate that piece of shit!

134
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,850
I'm tired of spending my time
waiting for you to quit acting like a child...

135
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,227
and act like a grown man
for a change, Mays!

136
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,466
I need to get on with my life!

137
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,866
I want a house, I want children!

138
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,995
I want to go on vacation!
You're horrible in bed!

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,541
I am tired of being engaged.
I am tired of being...

140
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,305
I wish you would.

141
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,222
For the last time,
I'm not running for President.

142
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,351
I'm not crazy! Gaines was 20 points behind.
It's ten weeks to Election Day.

143
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,587
Damn it!

144
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,424
They should have known better
than to talk on a cell phone in a plane.

145
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,763
- What about Sanderson?
- That's a joke.

146
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,098
Lewis has been Vice-President
for eight years.

147
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,797
He's a war hero and Sharon Stone's cousin.
He can't lose.

148
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,601
- What about Mosley?
- Girls.

149
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,800
- Connelly?
- Boys.

150
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,740
- McMasters?
- Big boys.

151
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,177
So we concede the election to Lewis?

152
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,308
Nobody is talking about conceding,
Debra, but let's get real here.

153
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,076
We'll lose this one.

154
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,314
The thing to do is to set the party up
for the next election.

155
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,584
We need a candidate
that will put on a good show.

156
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,061
This isn't a circus,
it's a presidential election.

157
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,622
You can't just pick some guy...

158
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,530
to run for President.

159
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,867
It's unprecedented,
but if I put in a call to the party chairman...

160
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,168
we find a candidate, he'll back him.

161
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,041
Who will run a race
they know they can't win?

162
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,578
Who says he has to know?

163
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,515
What the...

164
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,229
What now?

165
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,630
No, not my bike!

166
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,549
When I went in there
I wasn't thinking about being a hero.

167
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,880
I was just trying to help Miss Pearl.

168
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,283
Miss Pearl.

169
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,649
I think we found our man.

170
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,020
Look at this! This is great!

171
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,225
This is America, see?

172
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,824
Little guy against the big guy,
corporations against the people.

173
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,797
Young versus old. What's better than this?

174
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,663
Give me a break!

175
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,393
I am going to run an alderman
for President?

176
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,402
He's not an alderman.

177
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,073
He's a hero.

178
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,136
- Who doesn't like a hero?
- Big business loves a hero!

179
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,372
See?

180
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,847
You said we needed somebody
who can help the party.

181
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,749
Now, how in the hell
does this guy help the party?

182
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,386
I'm glad you asked.

183
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,512
The United States is changing.
America is changing.

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,683
Inside of 20 years, you know the numbers...

185
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,661
20 percent black,
21 percent Asian, 39 percent Hispanic.

186
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,894
The minorities will be the majority.
The smartest thing we can do...

187
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:46,538
is be the first party
to nominate a minority for President.

188
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,537
- How about a cripple?
- I don't think so, Charlie.

189
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,206
Now, we'll lose, of course,
but the minorities will be happy.

190
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,344
The minorities will be happy
and they will vote for us in 2008...

191
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,281
because we've shown we support them.

192
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,947
And the white people will vote for us...

193
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,848
- Because our guy isn't black.
- You got my vote!

194
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,418
Geller, see if you can track down
this Mays Gilliam.

195
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,597
Go check our accounts.

196
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,676
Give me one good reason
why I should go along with this.

197
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,581
Don't you get it, Debra?
I intend to run for President in 2008.

198
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,714
Now give me one reason why you shouldn't.

199
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,691
He would take a lot of work.

200
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,063
We can run a background check...

201
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,326
but it's obvious
he's not a party line candidate.

202
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,095
He's just some kid
who thinks he can make a difference.

203
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,069
Don't worry. Go out there,
put the machine behind him.

204
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,074
You get 25 points in the polls,
consider it a win.

205
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,668
Make sure he doesn't embarrass us.

206
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,269
After this is over, we get to work.

207
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,947
When I'm President, I'll take care of you.

208
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,481
Help me. They locked me out of my office.

209
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,286
I know. The mayor is fed up with you.

210
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,724
How many times have I told you?
You got to quit trying to fix shit.

211
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,925
I could've got you into the council
next term. Now you're red-lined.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,763
Shannon is taking over your district.

213
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:26,293
They need to smooth over the mall
situation, that bus thing is heating up.

214
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,397
- They don't trust you.
- I'm not the one stealing people's houses.

215
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,602
That's what your problem is.
You got to work with us.

216
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,240
That shit you pulled over there
cost the city money.

217
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,306
Makes the mayor look bad.

218
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,247
Now, contrary to popular belief,
politics is no place to express yourself.

219
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,616
You want to get in, you got to fit in.

220
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,693
And look at you.
Grow up, you got to dress better.

221
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,389
Even Puff Daddy wears a suit to court.

222
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,761
I'm sorry, brother, but ain't nothing I can do.

223
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,466
- Nice car.
- Ain't it, though?

224
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,099
Got it for a song at a repo auction.

225
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,334
He feels bad, mighty low

226
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,233
Got nowhere to go

227
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,037
What can you do when you're feeling low

228
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,075
Man, I want to know

229
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,209
He feels bad, mighty low
Got nowhere to go

230
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,675
What can you do when you're feeling low

231
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,484
And your car just got repo'd

232
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,881
Here we are.

233
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,245
Mays Gilliam, Debra Lassiter.

234
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,117
Nice to meet you. Take a seat.

235
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,956
We know what happened today.
We know you lost your job.

236
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,324
How do you know that? It just happened.

237
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,802
We're the government. We know everything.

238
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,833
We'd like you to do something for us.

239
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,433
Sure, I'd love to work
on a presidential campaign.

240
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,607
I'll make phone calls, send out fliers.

241
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,806
Who have you guys chosen
to run against Lewis?

242
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,751
That's exactly what we wanted
to talk to you about.

243
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,219
We'd like you to run for President.

244
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,764
- Of what?
- The United States.

245
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,759
- Of what?
- Of America.

246
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,170
Which America?

247
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,465
North...

248
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,566
America, Mays.

249
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,366
Get out of here!

250
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,300
We're not joking.

251
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,171
We want you to be the nominee
for the office of President...

252
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,580
of the United States of America.

253
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,787
Let me get this straight.

254
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,760
You guys couldn't find anybody else to run?
You couldn't find nobody?

255
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,452
Something is wrong here.

256
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,623
You couldn't find a congressman...

257
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,327
a senator? I'm just an alderman.

258
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,269
Congressmen, senators,
they work with other politicians.

259
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,300
You're an alderman.
You work with the people.

260
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,810
And that's what we want,
a man of the people.

261
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,573
This is a big joke, right?

262
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,740
They've got a hidden camera somewhere.

263
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,081
You all will get a big laugh out of this.
You know what? I don't care.

264
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,611
One of you all will drive me home
because my bike is messed up.

265
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,748
You an American?

266
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,719
- Are you an American?
- Yes.

267
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,994
This isn't just an election. It's a moment.

268
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,659
This is the moment when you have
the opportunity to show boys and girls...

269
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,104
men and women, what America is about.

270
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,575
Look at that.

271
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:30,780
When I see that, I think of our forefathers
fighting to make this country what it is.

272
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,114
When I see it I think about the guy who has
to scrub Lincoln's balls for minimum wage.

273
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,316
That's why we want you.
You care about the little people.

274
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,558
What will it be?

275
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,438
It gives me great honor...

276
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,977
to accept the party's nomination...

277
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,515
for President...

278
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,450
of the United States of America.

279
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,276
No!

280
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,723
Welcome to your campaign headquarters.

281
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,758
These folks will do everything they can
to help you get elected.

282
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,596
These are your people.

283
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,705
Here. Let's take a look at this.

284
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,435
Mark, is that cued up? Roll it, please.

285
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,276
This is a great spot.

286
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,686
If you love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

287
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,094
But I'm not in it.

288
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,430
You don't even see my face.

289
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,730
It's a template.
We'll get you in there eventually.

290
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,293
There's a couple of people
I want you to meet.

291
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,305
This is your security director, Mr. Earl.

292
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,069
- You'll be in good hands.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

293
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,410
If you're in trouble, yell "Security!"
and my people will handle the situation.

294
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,982
This is your decoy, Mays Junior.
He enters events before you.

295
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,884
If anything'll happen to you,
it'll happen to him first.

296
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,115
Tupac could have used a guy like you.

297
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,627
This is Nicollette White, she's
your executive director of Internal Liaisons.

298
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,060
Call me Nikki.
It will be a pleasure to serve you.

299
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,258
I'm available to you around the clock,
just let me know.

300
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,766
- What does she do?
- She sleeps with you.

301
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,705
We got tired of getting caught up
in sex scandals...

302
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,402
so we commissioned
our own team of super whores.

303
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,171
You call yourself whores!

304
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,179
Move that fat ass! One, two, three!

305
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,445
- These girls are good.
- Good morning, Mays.

306
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,644
I took the liberty of choosing some options
for this evening's fundraiser.

307
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,048
You don't mind, do you?

308
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,524
I'll wear whatever you need me to wear.
What fundraiser is this?

309
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,562
Your coming out party.
Campaigns cost money.

310
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,995
The people you meet tonight
have plenty of it.

311
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,090
Geller and I will advance the party...

312
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,897
and Mr. Earl will bring you at 8:00 sharp.

313
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,605
Here are your off-the-cuff remarks.
Learn them. See you later.

314
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,978
Remember, sir, just nod and move.
Nod and move.

315
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,985
What do you plan to do about taxes?

316
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,547
Do you plan to support
paternal leave incentives?

317
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,684
Get my demo to somebody. Anybody.

318
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,192
Don't take unscreened packages.
Security reasons.

319
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,497
You have some people to talk to.
Tomorrow, work.

320
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,058
Tonight, smile, shake hands,
and be nice to the wives.

321
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,594
I'll double-check the PA system.
You'll make a brief statement at 11:00.

322
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,867
Let's go.

323
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,610
Hi, how are you doing? All right.
You all right.

324
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,386
- I wish you luck, sir.
- Arigatou.

325
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,823
It's like Timberland,
and I got a bit of Missy moving up there...

326
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,492
but I'm trying to go through
that Neptune feel...

327
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,900
Excuse me, the Teamsters are here.

328
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,262
What are you doing talking to the help?

329
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,432
Gentlemen, Mr. Mays Gilliam.

330
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,238
Guys, I'm all for labor, I'm all for unions.

331
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,940
But you know and I know
that you will endorse Lewis.

332
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,575
It's business.
We'll do what's best for the union.

333
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,518
- Have you decided on a running mate?
- We're thinking about it.

334
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,216
- You should consider Sanders.
- We're considering several options.

335
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,218
Excuse me.

336
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,654
Well, that depends.

337
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,320
What's up with this guy?

338
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,797
Track four. Check out track four.

339
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,438
What do you have there?

340
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,567
We got shrimp puffs and cheese snacks...

341
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,805
- Just some finger foods.
- Thought that was you.

342
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,513
So what's up with the two jobs? Bad credit?

343
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,951
Why do I have to have bad credit?
Can't I be saving up for a car or for school?

344
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,580
Maybe I like to work? Excuse me.

345
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,120
I'm sorry. You know what?
I never got your name.

346
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,995
Hey, Lisa Clark. Mays.
Why you being so rude, Lisa Clark?

347
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,090
I am not being rude, I am working.

348
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,931
We can't mingle with the guests.
Plus, I don't know you.

349
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,631
- You know me.
- No, I don't know you.

350
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,831
But you know me.

351
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,773
You've come to the gas station
a couple of times...

352
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,539
and I see you, but I don't know you.

353
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,239
Let's get to know each other.

354
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,941
- Let's dance.
- I have to work.

355
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,112
I know you're working. I'm working, too.
So let's keep working. Want to dance?

356
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,178
Okay, you'll get me in trouble.

357
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,298
I cannot believe
you got me out here like this.

358
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,161
- Yeah, but you like it, right?
- A little.

359
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,800
I'm feeling it.

360
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,251
Go ahead, girl, work it!

361
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,668
Oh, my God. I'm having too much fun.
I got to get back to work.

362
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,401
No, come on, stay!

363
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,268
Come on!

364
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,010
Come on, brother,
I know you know how to do this dance.

365
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,448
No, sorry, I don't.

366
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,681
I know you know
how to do the Electric Slide.

367
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,482
No, I can't say that I do.

368
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,189
Get your ass in there!

369
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,794
- What the hell is this?
- Where's Mays?

370
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,629
Over there.

371
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,768
- Oh, my God!
- We've got to stop him.

372
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,273
Excuse us, please.

373
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,303
I am getting so hot
I am gonna take my clothes off

374
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,042
- What do you think you're doing?
- Stop it.

375
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,076
I'm just trying to get the party started.

376
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,413
Throw your hands in the air

377
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,617
And wave them like you just don't care

378
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,887
And if I got your vote for President

379
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,156
Let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah"

380
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,858
Shake that ass, Grandma!

381
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,566
Let me see you bounce!

382
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,433
Bounce!

383
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,765
We got a couple of freaks over there.

384
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,179
Let me see you shake!

385
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,181
Crip walk!

386
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,987
The roof is on fire!

387
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,597
No, it's a saying!

388
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,503
It's just a saying. Come back!

389
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:13,437
You turned the party out.
I have never seen anything like that.

390
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,740
Great party. Too bad about the fire.

391
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,610
- So, where are you off to now?
- I'm not even sure.

392
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,052
We start campaigning tomorrow.
We'll be all over the country.

393
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,284
Need a ride home?

394
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,657
I still have to clean up.
I don't know how long that will take me.

395
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,195
I could wait.

396
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,822
Are you sure?
I could send a car to pick you up.

397
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,027
No, thanks, but I got to go.

398
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,797
It was good seeing you again.

399
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,532
You too, buddy, old pal.

400
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,599
- Can I get a good-night kiss?
- No.

401
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,171
- I'm coming!
- She's coming!

402
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:54,114
I got to go. Good luck,
and call me if you get a chance.

403
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,450
Didn't you see me talking?

404
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,822
What kind of display was that?

405
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,621
I was getting the party started.

406
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,822
If the party needs to get started,
I'll handle it.

407
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,199
Just do what we say.

408
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,497
I don't think everybody appreciated
what you did in there.

409
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,265
We really had a great time.

410
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,464
It was off the hizzle for shizzle.

411
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,934
- They liked it.
- I don't care what they liked.

412
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,769
Mays, darling!

413
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,309
Darling, are you done yet?
No? If not, it's okay. I can wait.

414
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,652
But if we hurry,
we'll be able to get a table at Jezebel's.

415
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,186
Good evening. We're getting married.

416
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,357
I'm exhausted.

417
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,495
Know what I can't decide?

418
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,659
I can't decide whether we should have
a DJ or a band.

419
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,032
Security!

420
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,618
Thank you for inviting me
to the land of milk and honey.

421
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,817
It's you people, the dairy people...

422
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,725
people that make eggs, milk, cheese...

423
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,889
butter, bacon, that make the country great.

424
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,501
Milk makes the body good,
and you make the country good.

425
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,832
Thank you for inviting me
to Memphis, Tennessee.

426
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,646
It's people like you, the church people...

427
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,909
who are the backbone
and the spirit of this great land of ours.

428
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:38,479
I love the Lord,
and I love the King, Elvis Presley.

429
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:46,627
I want to thank you for inviting me
to the Lone Star State.

430
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,300
Home of the cowboys!

431
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,163
How about them Cowboys?

432
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,699
It's people like you, the ranchers...

433
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,272
who are the backbone of this country.

434
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:04,308
Now, before I go,
I got one more thing to say:

435
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,917
The stars at night are big and bright

436
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,012
Deep in the heart of Texas

437
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,949
It's not bad.

438
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,326
Will I get another speech anytime soon?

439
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,160
What's the matter with this speech?

440
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,633
I should be talking about something
a little more relevant.

441
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,060
Relevant?

442
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,504
People would be cheering
if I read the recipe for corn bread.

443
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,075
It's not working.
I'm only one point up in the polls.

444
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,806
Don't worry about the polls.
They're just a sampling. Polls change.

445
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,404
Don't get ahead of yourself.

446
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,349
We're here to help.
The people really like you.

447
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,819
Cheer up, we'll be in Chicago in a few days.
You got a brother there.

448
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,288
Then the people will find out
what you're all about.

449
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,053
Yeah, but I don't even know
what I'm all about.

450
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:59,960
In the latest polls, Mays Gilliam is up
just one point, to 10 percent.

451
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,597
Vice President Brian Lewis
still holds a commanding 84 percent.

452
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,676
Six percent are undecided, saying...

453
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,510
they don't know who they're voting for,
they just know it's not Gilliam.

454
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,308
When you get out there, listen to the crowd.

455
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,978
Talk to them, make it look like
you believe in what you're saying.

456
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,350
I know we haven't exactly
always seen eye to eye...

457
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,585
but this is very important.

458
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,355
- I can't stress that enough.
- Alderman Gilliam?

459
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,294
There's a Mitch Gilliam outside.
He says he's your brother.

460
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,127
Send him in.

461
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,437
Tonight, America will get
its first impressions of Mays Gilliam.

462
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,202
You know what they say
about first impressions.

463
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:44,246
Look at my little brother!
You said you'd call when you got here.

464
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,250
I was trying to call you,
but I've been doing press all day.

465
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,582
My little brother, running for President.

466
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,748
Let me introduce you to Martin Geller,
Debra Lassiter.

467
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,328
What's happening, baby? Thanks for what
you're doing for my brother. Appreciate it.

468
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,260
How about you, thriller? What's going...

469
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,958
Nice to meet you.
What do you do for a living?

470
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,431
I'm a bail bondsman.
I got an office on the Southside.

471
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,734
- Bail bondsman.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,608
How's business?

473
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,081
I tell you how business is.
Business is great.

474
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,913
Thank God for crime.

475
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,181
Thank God for crime.
Could you give us a minute?

476
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,817
Five.

477
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,923
Nice. Real nice.

478
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,764
Look at you, man!
I see you all on the shows, politicking.

479
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,269
You like the way your campaign is going?

480
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,804
Look at this.

481
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,135
Let me ask you something, brother.
When they gonna let you speak?

482
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,803
I've been talking all day.
I was talking to the press.

483
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:51,313
You been talking, but when they gonna
let you speak your mind?

484
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,249
This ain't you. You gonna say this shit?
This shit is booty.

485
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,119
Say this if you want to, watch that man
come sweep your butt off stage.

486
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:01,781
Look at this poster: "Mays."
Who are they talking about? Willie?

487
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,286
Let me tell you something.

488
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,853
They're the everyday common folk,
working people. Laborers.

489
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,123
Construction workers, nurses.

490
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,668
Play the game
when you're working for them.

491
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,534
This is your campaign.
You're supposed to be in charge.

492
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,873
It's time.

493
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,937
I got to go.

494
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,879
I love you, man,
and I'm with you no matter what.

495
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,148
- Go get them.
- I'll see you out there.

496
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,686
Speak.

497
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:43,224
Chicago, please welcome
your next president:

498
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,834
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

499
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,615
What the hell is he doing?

500
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,093
They had a speech written for me...

501
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,568
about what the people need.

502
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,030
But you guys are the people.

503
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,769
You know what you need.

504
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,171
Better schools...

505
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,610
better jobs...

506
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,601
less crime.

507
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,712
How many of you, right now...

508
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:38,784
work two jobs
just to have enough money to be broke?

509
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,923
That ain't right.

510
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,058
If you work two jobs,
and at the end of the week...

511
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,630
you got just enough money
to get your broke ass home...

512
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,098
let me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

513
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,566
That ain't right!

514
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,976
How many of you have children
that they call stupid?

515
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,877
Don't be ashamed! It ain't your fault.

516
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,643
I asked my niece the other day,
"What's four plus four?" She said, "44."

517
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,514
But that ain't her fault!
That's the school's fault.

518
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,683
If your child's school has old-ass books...

519
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,319
and brand-new metal detectors,
let me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

520
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,953
That ain't right!

521
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,324
It ain't right.

522
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,165
And now we got these corporations
stealing all the money.

523
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,266
They ain't stealing their money,
they stealing our money!

524
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,567
The pension.

525
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,665
You work for 35 years.

526
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:35,835
You thought you'd leave your kids
a will, now you'll leave them a won't!

527
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,616
You show up to get your pension,
they give you a pen!

528
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:44,454
A damn pen! What in the hell
am I supposed to do with a pen?

529
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:48,388
I should stab you in the neck
with this pen, Mr. Pension Taker.

530
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,459
Get your hand out of my pocket!

531
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,062
Taking everybody's pension,
and nobody going to jail.

532
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,498
That's some bullshit. Ain't it?

533
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,331
Meanwhile, we steal a Big Mac with cheese...

534
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,498
next thing you know, we on Death Row!

535
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,665
That ain't right!

536
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:11,676
How many of you work in a city
you can't afford to live in?

537
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,976
That ain't right!

538
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,619
How many of you work in a mall
you can't afford to shop in?

539
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,986
That ain't right!

540
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,888
How many of you clean up a hotel...

541
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,554
you ain't never gonna be able to stay in?

542
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,128
That ain't right!

543
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:35,705
We got nurses that work in hospitals
they can't even afford to get sick in.

544
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,535
It ain't right!

545
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,741
It isn't right!

546
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,085
That shit is wrong!

547
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,688
It's dead wrong!

548
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,187
I'm Mays Gilliam...

549
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,788
and I'm running for President
of the United States of America.

550
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,809
No questions. Sorry.

551
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,778
Where's Mitch?

552
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:20,540
Go to work. Handle your business.
If you need me, call me.

553
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,445
I'll call you.

554
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,814
Are you insane? You can't just go out
in front of 5,000 people and talk!

555
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,518
And you said "shit."
Presidential candidates do not say "shit."

556
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,224
Show me a man that's never said shit,
I'll show you someone full of shit!

557
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,390
Debra, hold on.

558
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,834
What you just did, that was great.

559
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,938
Maybe you're right.
We could tailor the speeches more to you.

560
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,301
My speeches?

561
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,965
Come on, did you hear them?

562
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,671
If this is gonna work, it's got to fit me.
It's got to be my campaign.

563
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,212
This is not your campaign.

564
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,614
You do what I tell you to,
or you'll be back in D.C. on your bicycle.

565
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,879
I'm the one running for President.

566
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,184
If we're gonna run this campaign,
it's got to go my way.

567
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,225
We're gonna do it the way I want it done.

568
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,954
Hold on.
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

569
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,724
If you don't know, you better ask somebody.

570
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,445
After a slow start, Mays Gilliam
has made some dramatic changes...

571
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,312
in his presidential campaign.

572
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:40,660
Hi. I'm Mays Gilliam,
candidate for President of the United States.

573
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,865
This is my new headquarters.

574
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:47,098
The individuals you see before you
will help me guide my campaign.

575
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,999
These are my people.

576
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,737
Mays Gilliam is turning the establishment
on its ear...

577
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,246
with his new controversial campaign ads.

578
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,687
If you love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

579
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,187
Paid for by Citizens for Mays Gilliam.

580
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,033
The part of Mays Gilliam's
security director...

581
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:30,045
will now be played
by Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad.

582
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,881
Childcare is one of the most important
issues facing this country today.

583
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,988
The working mother
has to take her child to a nanny.

584
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:42,056
The nanny has to take her child
to a babysitter.

585
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,890
The babysitter
has to take her child to daycare.

586
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:49,262
On the count of three, I want everybody
to take care of their own damn kids!

587
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,495
Whose baby is this? It ain't mine!

588
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:58,701
Gay people want what every American
wants. A good house, a good job!

589
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,944
I believe in gay rights
because when I see gay people...

590
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,948
all I'm seeing are people,
normal people like every other American.

591
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,656
Thank you for inviting me
to the Player's Ball!

592
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,159
America needs to change its ways.

593
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,559
I promise if I'm your President,
I will take care of everybody:

594
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:31,274
Big business and small business,
show business and ho business.

595
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,044
Hello, Debra.

596
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,111
Bill?

597
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,655
I am in Detroit at a Player's Ball
with pimps and whores.

598
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,659
Excuse me, hoes!

599
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,894
I can't do this. You got to get me
out of here. I can't control him.

600
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,456
He won't listen to me!

601
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,993
No, Debra.
I need you out there, and this is going great.

602
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,500
This is what we wanted.

603
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,836
I love this guy. "That ain't right."

604
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,876
He really thinks he can make a difference.

605
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,074
Stop worrying. This will work out fine. Bye.

606
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,816
Don't I know you?

607
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,078
No!

608
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:31,199
He feels good
Things are going his way

609
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,766
He just might be
The President someday

610
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,936
Mays, darling, I've been thinking.
I want a small wedding.

611
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,637
I think I want 150, maybe 200 people.

612
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,212
I've always said
I wanted a wedding in a church...

613
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,115
but lately I've been thinking about
the Botanical Gardens.

614
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,710
We could do it by the tulips.
It'll be beautiful...

615
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,185
Security!

616
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,701
Who the hell is Mays Gilliam?

617
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,831
He's running against you, sir.

618
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,566
What happened to Gaines?

619
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,144
He died in a plane crash.

620
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,778
Get out of here! Gaines is dead?

621
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,917
- Don't you remember? It was on the news!
- Not my news.

622
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,653
This fellow, Gilliam,
is an alderman from D.C.

623
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,884
He took Gaines' place, sir.

624
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,516
I'm running against this guy.

625
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,525
Yes, sir.

626
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,390
That is some bullshit.

627
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,187
This is my time.

628
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,597
I've been Vice President for eight years.

629
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:14,431
I am a war hero,
and I am Sharon Stone's cousin!

630
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:19,237
And I'll be damned if I'm going to let
my election be ruined by this asshole!

631
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:24,040
I want this guy done. You hear me?
Finish him!

632
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,614
He will be destroyed, sir, as you wish.

633
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,843
This is the White House
without Mays Gilliam. Peaceful, isn't it?

634
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,152
Now, this is the White House
if Gilliam is elected.

635
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,735
Let's keep Mays Gilliam
out of the White House.

636
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,738
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

637
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,500
How do you want to handle this?

638
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,344
I don't want to go negative.

639
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,013
Nobody wants to hear that.

640
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,915
I want people to vote for me,
not against Lewis.

641
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,249
- People don't know what they want to hear.
- We have to respond.

642
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,984
We should go with something measured,
accurate. Let's call him on his record!

643
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:11,027
You can't challenge his record
when Mays doesn't have one.

644
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,460
How about a massage?

645
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,730
Ladies and gentlemen...

646
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,792
please welcome
presidential candidate Mays Gilliam.

647
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,580
Thank you!

648
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,216
This is Conservative Talk 520.
You're listening to Big Dave.

649
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,984
Negative ads. Lewis is up, Gilliam is down.
I think it's great!

650
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,046
Bottom line:

651
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,561
I don't think I want Gilliam
and his homies to be in the White House.

652
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,500
People are saying these ads
are dirty politics. Give me a small break!

653
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,130
We're not talking about running
a rib shack but a country!

654
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,105
He's running for President
and every vote counts!

655
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,072
Ladies and gentlemen, Mays Gilliam!

656
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:06,242
And if these ads are so bad,
why hasn't Gilliam said anything?

657
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,116
Howard Stern rocks!

658
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,912
You're on with Big Dave.

659
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,684
The reason Gilliam hasn't responded
is because he has too much integrity.

660
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,595
We just got endorsements
from Raekwon the Chef...

661
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,533
and Ghostface Killah.

662
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,906
- Is this good?
- It's great.

663
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,935
Where are we on this running mate thing?

664
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,315
I've been making calls.
Nobody wants to run with you.

665
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:39,948
Who did you call?

666
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,075
Everybody.

667
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,147
Did you call Hammer?

668
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,480
No, I did not call Hammer.

669
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,127
Then you didn't call everybody.

670
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,690
Mr. Gilliam, can I have your autograph?

671
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,061
I'll be right back.

672
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,962
- Should we call Hammer?
- No.

673
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,197
Say cheese!

674
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,535
Mays Gilliam did not attend
this year's annual rally against cancer.

675
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,909
Is Mays Gilliam for cancer
or against cancer?

676
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,546
Mays Gilliam, he's for cancer.

677
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:19,920
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

678
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,454
Cancer lover!

679
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,696
No, he does not get away with this crap!

680
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,290
This is what we'll do.
You ever watch Bugs Bunny?

681
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:35,202
Bugs would always shoot Elmer Fudd
in the face and drop an anvil on his head.

682
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,705
But what made Elmer really mad
is when Bugs Bunny kissed him.

683
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,571
We got to kiss this bitch.

684
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,446
- How do you propose we do that?
- Watch this.

685
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,846
I'm a Klansman. I hate niggers, Jews,
and fags, but I love Brian Lewis.

686
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,386
Yo, what's up? I'm Osama Bin Laden.

687
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,352
I hate America, but I love Brian Lewis.

688
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,718
Paid for by Osama Bin Laden.

689
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,658
Sharon Stone is a defector.

690
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,131
That's what Lewis campaign insiders
are saying about the Hollywood star...

691
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,899
and cousin of Vice President Lewis,
after Stone's endorsement of Mays Gilliam.

692
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,233
I don't believe it!

693
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,108
Yeah!

694
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,376
I know!

695
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,673
Did you hear...

696
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,947
What are you doing here?

697
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,782
Gilliam is over 30 points.

698
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,324
That means even if he loses
he's the frontrunner in 2008.

699
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,452
In case you've forgotten,
I intend to run for President in 2008...

700
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,359
and I am not running against him.

701
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,791
So this is over.
Either you put a stop to it or I will.

702
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,597
I came on board to run a campaign
for a man we didn't expect to win...

703
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,797
not to sabotage him so he'd lose.

704
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,400
You're in this as thick as I am.
Of course he's supposed to lose!

705
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,943
That's why we picked him.

706
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,445
Are you with me or are you with him?

707
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,675
I thought you wanted
what was best for the party.

708
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,377
I'm what's best for the party!

709
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,750
What's the matter?

710
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,017
Democracy doesn't work for you
when you're not winning?

711
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,024
I'm with him.

712
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,798
I'm with him?

713
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,811
- Who are these people again?
- The Urban Business Board.

714
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,907
- What are your plans for Social Security?
- Give it to old people.

715
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,451
- Your plans on global warming?
- Global ice tea.

716
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,181
- You the man!
- You the woman!

717
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,624
I want to introduce you
to Chester Norris Allen.

718
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:41,159
He owns a bottling plant in D.C.
and I spoke to him about our problem.

719
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,721
We've got a nice check for you.

720
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,496
We can't take it. You sell malt liquor to kids.

721
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:46,866
I do no such thing.

722
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,168
Come on, man. It's orange beer
with a nipple top. Now, who's that for?

723
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,068
It's Crib Malt Liquor, man!

724
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,744
He's unbelievable!

725
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,813
Damn it, we need that money!
Why do you make everything so difficult?

726
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,782
It's Crib Malt Liquor!

727
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,253
"Crib Malt Liquor,
just like Mama used to make"?

728
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,879
Whose mama? Not my mama!

729
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,591
The situation is getting tense with the threat
of the bus line being shut down.

730
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,596
Protestors took their concerns
to transit officials...

731
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,657
but talks broke down when the newly
appointed alderman, Reginald Shannon...

732
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,464
was punched in the face
by an angry protestor.

733
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,405
- Good evening, sir.
- What's up, Nikki?

734
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,275
I noticed you weren't at the party,
so I thought...

735
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:34,350
if there is anything you would like
for me to do, I would be happy to.

736
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,076
Could I ask you something?

737
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,649
Yes.

738
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,324
You seem like a nice girl.

739
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,156
How did you get into this line of work?

740
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,528
I went to the University of Nebraska...

741
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,698
where I majored
in Theater and Communications.

742
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,242
I did some extra work,
and a few things that went straight to video.

743
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,517
Okay.

744
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,712
Can I ask you a question?

745
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,014
Yeah, sure.

746
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:15,591
Since I've been here, you haven't really
given me any assignments.

747
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,094
I was wondering if you find me attractive.

748
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,097
I think you're...

749
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,069
I think you're very attractive. It's just that...

750
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,769
I like to get to know people
before I get involved.
