Here are the guardian reports
from this week.

183
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:21,014
Is there anything from Akae?

184
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,715
Turned out to be nothing.

185
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,384
Are we sure?

186
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:29,989
While I agree that their initial
interaction was... concerning,

187
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,558
Akae listened to
their entire conversation

188
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,726
from start to finish

189
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:37,797
and I assure you there's nothing
to be worried about.

190
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,099
I'd like her to keep going.

191
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:42,568
Are you certain?

192
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,437
There was nothing she said
that indicated...

193
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,372
THE PILOT: I'm sure.

194
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,745
Is there something
I should know?

195
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,317
A man named Helias
used to work with the Pilot.

196
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,787
He was a defective individual

197
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:05,058
who concocted something that
the Pilot describes as a virus,

198
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,627
something intended to destroy
the Code.

199
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,997
Helias was rehabilitated,
his mind wiped clean,

200
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,267
but the Pilot fears
his ideas remained,

201
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,270
that somehow
they were passed down.

202
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:19,172
And he thinks
that the woman Logos met

203
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,174
might be one of these people?

204
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:23,643
Maybe.

205
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:27,680
Probably not if you ask me,
but he wants us...

206
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,683
..you to make sure.

207
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:52,672
I didn't think anybody reads
those things anymore.

208
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,608
What is it?

209
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,443
Just a book.

something like that.

Before humans lived forever.

283
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,210
His shorthand was a bit
difficult to interpret,

284
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,679
but ultimately,
after some trial and error,

285
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,614
we were able to get it right.

286
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,918
- Who is this person?
- Helias was his name.

287
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:02,455
Arcade is
our resident historian.

288
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,423
There's not much about
the creation of Alisandre

289
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,225
that he doesn't know.

290
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:09,829
Sometimes I think there are
far more unknowns than knowns.

291
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:12,565
Originally, Helias worked
closely with the Pilot

292
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,900
in the development of the Code
and Maintenance.

293
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:18,404
But once the Code was completed
and implemented worldwide,

294
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:21,140
Helias discovered that the Pilot
had gone further.

295
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,808
The Pilot had modified genes

296
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,678
that had nothing to do with
health or longevity.

297
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,047
Helias started asking questions.

298
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,583
The Pilot of course
didn't approve of his probe.

299
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:34,086
The trust was gone.
They parted ways.

300
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,921
The Pilot began
to wipe the minds

301
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:38,457
of all the original mortals.

302
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:41,394
Helias became the only immortal,
other than the Pilot,

303
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,529
to have memories
of mortal existence.

304
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,398
The Pilot collected
and stored the information

305
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,966
in his data centre.

306
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,201
Where is he now?

307
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:51,437
The Pilot eventually had Helias
captured and rehabilitated.

308
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,006
That's a nice way to say
they erased his mind.

309
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,877
- Killed him without killing him.
- MASIM: We all see it.

310
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,078
What he showed us -

311
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,215
when you reduce Maintenance,
you begin to change.

312
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:05,651
Maintenance contains
mood stabilisers.

313
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,820
So you essentially become

314
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:10,523
a muted version of the person
you're supposed to be.

315
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,225
Which is why we want to alter
the Maintenance,

316
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:14,460
lower its potency,

317
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:16,829
so that everyone in Alisandre
can experience

318
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,063
for a few moments

319
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,734
a version of what real
human existence feels like.

320
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,436
And then what?

321
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:26,205
Well, removing the Maintenance
only gives us

322
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,874
an edited version
of the human experience.

323
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,445
None of us can really understand
what it feels like to be human

324
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:36,182
without the stakes
of human life.

325
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:38,150
Without being mortal.

326
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:43,823
Are you talking about destroying
the Code itself?

327
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,994
WOMAN: I remember you telling me

328
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:52,698
that Helias's belief
in mortal religion was flawed.

329
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:55,701
I didn't know you could still
remember that long ago.

330
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,470
I thought we'd removed
that data.

331
00:19:57,472 --> 00:20:00,206
I remember you telling me
that mortals needed religion

332
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,641
because they were afraid
of dying.

333
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:07,213
But with immortal beings,
there is no fear of death

334
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,682
and so no need for religion.

335
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,451
Religious citizens talked about

336
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,821
being alive
for a God-given purpose,

337
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:19,325
that their time on Earth
was intentionally difficult,

338
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,697
and that they were each given
a soul which was immortal.

339
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,568
That was the logic
of primitive minds.

340
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,538
Of course I always knew
that science and technology

341
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,073
were the real gods.

342
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,509
Their god never worked for
the greater good of the world.

343
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,177
Mine always did.

344
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,579
Humans... Um...

345
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:44,950
The... the human condition
needed to evolve.

346
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,655
What about Helias?
What did he believe?

347
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:52,958
You're full of questions
tonight.

348
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,762
Why don't we get back
to the game?

349
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,677
At the beginning,

350
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,547
Helias was as secular
as they come.

351
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:18,150
When we were at Harvard,
he never mentioned religion.

352
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,251

somewhere inside

535
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,270
that I can't quite access.

536
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,439
That's exactly what
Helias thought.

537
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:18,076
He believed there was a creator
of this universe and of man.

538
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:21,213
He said that mortals believed
that they each had an essence -

539
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:22,647
he called it the soul -

540
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,117
which had a purpose given to it
by this creator.

541
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,652
Instead, the Pilot decided

542
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,655
to determine a purpose
for each one of us,

543
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,358
essentially denying us
the right to our own destiny.

544
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,095
And while we still feel
emotions, they're limited.

545
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:40,131
Mortals experienced more.

546
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,766
Much more.

547
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:43,768
What's the point?

548
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:46,338
What do you mean?

549
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,206
While what this man,
Helias, believed

550
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,242
is certainly interesting,

551
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:52,010
what's the point
in believing in a mortal life

552
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:55,146
when it's not something
we're genetically capable of?

553
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:57,449
It just seems futile to me.

He felt it was a very important
part of the human experience.

We are planning on
restoring Helias's mind data.

But in order to do that,
we need to find Helias.

Everyone believes it's a gift,
as you say,

579
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,664
because the Maintenance
they're taking every single day

580
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,599
makes them believe
that that's true.

we had created,

1067
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,098
What about free will?

1068
01:09:22,901 --> 01:09:27,003
Free will is responsible
for every grain of suffering

1069
01:09:27,005 --> 01:09:29,038
in human history.

1070
01:09:30,341 --> 01:09:33,910
I watched many people die.

1071
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:35,778
People I cared about.

1072
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:39,482
And I saved everyone.

1073
01:09:39,484 --> 01:09:43,786
I saved everyone else
from experiencing that pain.

1074
01:09:50,962 --> 01:09:52,995
Look at me.

1075
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,101
Death is nothing more
than a looming black hole.

1076
01:10:01,105 --> 01:10:05,141
There is no other existence

1077
01:10:05,143 --> 01:10:08,044
on some other plane.

1078
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,481
No god, no angels.

1079
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,885
It's a fairytale, Amanda.

1080
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:17,753
It's fantasy.

1081
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:22,225
I created heaven in Alisandre.

1082
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:24,660
Right here, right now.

1083
01:10:30,635 --> 01:10:34,237
Why should there ever be
all that suffering?

1084
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:39,041
Why would Logos want to be
responsible for this?

1085
01:10:43,915 --> 01:10:45,715
I created him.

1086
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:51,087
I gave him life,

1087
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:52,755
safety,

1088
01:10:52,757 --> 01:10:57,593
a... a place away from fear
and uncertainty.

1089
01:10:57,595 --> 01:11:00,696
They all are right here with me.

1091
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:13,676

from yourself, Logos.

1098
01:11:31,296 --> 01:11:33,996
That is being alive.

1099
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,598
And that is beautiful.

1100
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,000
Alright, I'm here. What is it?

1101
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,836
We need to act now.

1102
01:11:41,573 --> 01:11:42,972
Your worry is not warranted.

1103
01:11:42,974 --> 01:11:44,907
Do you not see
what is happening?

1104
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:47,410
A natural immunity
to Maintenance

1105
01:11:47,412 --> 01:11:49,345
was bound to happen.

1106
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:50,746
I could not prevent it.

1107
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:53,349
If he actually is different,

1108
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,752
isn't that more reason
to be concerned?

1109
01:11:57,889 --> 01:12:01,457
<i>We all live by blind faith
in a man.</i>

1110
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:03,526
<i>But is he as wise
as we believe him to be?</i>

1111
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:08,130
<i>By handing over our liberty to
him, are we not subject to him?</i>

1112
01:12:08,132 --> 01:12:10,566
<i>Are we not slaves?</i>

1113
01:12:10,568 --> 01:12:11,968

1114
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,370

as it should be seen.</i>

1115

Despite our watchers' vigilance,
their movement is growing.

1116
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:22,011
Citizens are experimenting
with reduced Maintenance,

1117
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:25,214
displaying signs of irrational
thought and behaviour.

1118
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,150
I see what you see.

1119
01:12:28,152 --> 01:12:30,786
Sir, we are losing control!

1120
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:33,889
THE PILOT:
<i>WE are not losing anything.</i>

1121
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,327
<i>Everything will be
as it should be.</i>

1122
01:12:38,329 --> 01:12:40,229
And what about Logos?

1123
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,697
He is openly upturning

1124
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:44,166
everything that
you have created.

1125
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:47,370
THE PILOT: <i>I will deal with
Logos when the time is right.</i>

1126
01:12:48,773 --> 01:12:51,207
You're not concerned
in the least?

1127
01:12:53,645 --> 01:12:56,212
Logos has no idea
what he's doing.

1128
01:12:57,148 --> 01:12:59,248
He's going to die.

1129
01:13:01,552 --> 01:13:03,152
Perhaps.

1130
01:13:03,154 --> 01:13:05,454
But who knows
what will actually happen?

1131
01:13:05,456 --> 01:13:08,057
The diffuser is a prototype.

1132
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:12,161
It will take much more
to discover

1133
01:13:12,163 --> 01:13:16,198
how to actually separate
the Code from the genome.

1134
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,068
There's only one other
who could actually do that.

1135
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:23,139
Helias.

1136
01:13:26,878 --> 01:13:28,944
So they would need you.

(SCOFFS SOFTLY)

1138
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:42,458

Hopeful.

1140
01:13:47,265 --> 01:13:51,300
He didn't appreciate
what my design became.

1141
01:13:53,337 --> 01:13:56,906
I had to sacrifice him
for the greater good.

1142
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:02,745
It was quite simple actually
to separate his data from mine.

1143
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:06,215
We'd become
two clearly different thinkers.

1144
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:10,119
You did this
after he created the diffuser.

1145
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,323
He went rogue.

1146
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:20,730
Overnight, it seemed he reverted
back to being a... primitive.

1147
01:14:23,701 --> 01:14:25,901
He was difficult to control.

1148
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:29,872
He started spreading
subversive information

1149
01:14:29,874 --> 01:14:32,875
and then came his efforts

1150
01:14:32,877 --> 01:14:35,745
to undermine the Code.

1151
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,918
But... you won.

1152
01:14:47,725 --> 01:14:51,961
His data is in my control

1153
01:14:51,963 --> 01:14:54,897
and entirely useless
to anyone but me.

1154
01:14:55,633 --> 01:15:01,003
The only human genome which
could accept it would be mine.
