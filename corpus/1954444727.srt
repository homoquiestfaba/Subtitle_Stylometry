1
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,643
Dude, I can't believe that
this is actually happening Zach.

2
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,440
I know I know I keep feeling like
I'm going to wake up from a dream.

3
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,703
- You want me to pinch you?
- Yes.

4
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:48,904
Alright.

5
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,011
- You said pinch!
- I'm sorry. Do me.

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,453
Shit! This is actually happening.

7
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,983
You're right.
We need to chill out.

8
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,725
We can't look like dorks
on our first day out.

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,859
Okay.

10
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,161
Alright.

11
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,801
Oh my god.

12
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,281
Yeah Dickface!

13
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,110
It's beautiful man.

14
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,076
It's just beautiful.

15
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,440
Good evening gentlemen.

16
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,945
It's daytime.

17
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,123
Mr. President.

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,285
So it is.

19
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,153
You boys are ready
to be inducted.

20
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,824
Yes Mr. President.

21
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,127
See, as new Alpha's these boys
have to call me Mr. President

22
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,232
or else they get punched
in the dick.

23
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,468
Boys, this is Charity. This is Faith.

24
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,371
Girls this is Zach and uh...

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,604
- What is it? Christian?
- Cameron.

26
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,348
Boys, welcome to 24-hour
party machine man!

27
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,020
Someone get these boys a beer
and a hand job.

28
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,324
- You alright man?
- I'm just so happy.

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,058
I love this place.

30
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,040
Alright girls
put your shirts back on,

31
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,213
we're going downstairs
for the Induction ceremony.

32
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,047
Not you.
You're meet me in my room.

33
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,941
Yes Mr. President.

34
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,119
See fellas, that right there...
never gets old.

35
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,927
Alright fellas quit fucking around
we got some cherries to pop

36
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,459
and some serious partying to do!

37
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,565
Oh shit, did you hear
what he just said.

38
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,094
Oh my god.

39
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,326
We're not even at
the serious partying yet.

40
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,835
It's even better then I imagined.

41
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,811
The average male graduate
makes $125,000 per year,

42
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,610
meanwhile the average
female graduate

43
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,144
make $41,500 per year.

44
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,852
- This is bullshit.
- Yes! It is bullshit Misty.

45
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,384
And why would these women

46
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,086
put up with such inequitable
excusable desperaties,

47
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,159
somehow the women or sterling
college get it in their heads

48
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,732
that being married to
one of these successful men

49
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,133
is just as good
as being successful themselves.

50
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,136
Which is a bunch of hoowie!

51
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,932
Yes?

52
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,874
Is the Astronaut single?

53
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,171
What?

54
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,274
That's not the point.

55
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,944
The point is that we work so hard
to get into this college.

56
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,880
We're just not here
for the parties,

57
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,287
the sex, and to land
some rich husband. Right?

58
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,151
Then what are you here
Ms. Kramer?

59
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,122
It is Ms. Kramer isn't it?

60
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,966
- Kelly Kramer?
- Associate Dean Marshall.

61
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,002
Yes, I know who I am.

62
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,662
So...

63
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,572
This is Delta Pi Sorority.

64
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,633
I heard you were meeting.

65
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,075
Even though
you don't have a house.

66
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,679
I say it shows resolved.

67
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,438
I say it shows resolve.

68
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,942
It's pathetic!

69
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,884
And not only that, it's unfair.

70
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,284
Especially when you consider
how many houses

71
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,549
of fraternities have,
am I right ladies?

72
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,058
- Yeah.
- Defiantly.

73
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,221
Sterling college has always offered
more opportunities

74
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,725
to it's male students.

75
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:03,027
You really think that you
and your quote unquote sorority

76
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,330
can over turn 50 years
of history?

77
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,439
Yes! I do!

78
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,846
I was hoping you'd say that.

79
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,016
Gentlemen.

80
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,622
Today you enter an
elite brotherhood

81
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,725
established by
our founders in 1963.

82
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,955
Just as Sterling College is
know as the cradle of awesome,

83
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,932
Alpha house is known as a place
where awesome

84
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,533
goes to get it's freak on.

85
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,270
Now, are you ready to uphold
the tradition of this fraternity?

86
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,432
If yes, let me hear you say yeah.

87
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,107
- Yeah!
- Good.

88
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,271
Do you swear
to never speak ill of her.

89
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,644
- Let me hear you say "Yeah".
- Yeah!

90
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,849
To never let her hallow halls
fall silent.

91
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,086
To never let her kegs
run empty.

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,886
And to never ever
let the party die.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,719
Fuck yeah!

94
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,323
Now, suck the guys dick
on your immediate left.

95
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,032
What?

96
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,270
- Really?
- No, I was just messing with you.

97
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,736
I just wanted to see
if you'd really do it.

98
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,067
I have nobody to my left.

99
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,277
Gentlemen.

100
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,409
Welcome to Alpha House.

101
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,140
- Hey! Who turned off the lights?
- What the fuck?

102
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,119
I'm sorry Mr. Kroger.

103
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,353
Am I interrupting something?

104
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,254
Of course not.

105
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,692
It's always an honor to be visited
by our associate Dean.

106
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,730
I see you're inducting
a fresh batch of perverts,

107
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,426
drunks, and future fellons.

108
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,999
How fratuitous that I found you
in a very excepting frame of mind.

109
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,836
You thinking about pledging?

110
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,105
It's very flattering
but unfortunately

111
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,840
we're about the capacity
for the year.

112
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,214
Though the peace offering
with the strippers

113
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,841
was not a bad move.

114
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,747
I see they went for
the naughty bookworm look.

115
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,513
What you couldn't throw
in one sexy cop?

116
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,587
You see? This is why I'm here.

117
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,556
For too long Alpha House
has been the a bastian

118
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,487
for sex, drugs...

119
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,961
Stop! Stop! Stop it!
It's not a good thing!

120
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,596
It's everything that's wrong
with Sterling College!

121
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,733
But we are going
to transform it

122
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,440
into a shining example
of everything

123
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,974
that Sterling College has to offer.

124
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,578
Opportunity. Diversity.

125
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,816
- Equality.
- Can you get to the point?

126
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,043
I'm sobering up over here.

127
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,017
Gentlemen.

128
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,749
- Meet your new brothers.
- Hello boys.

129
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,057
As of tonight,

130
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,525
I am making Alpha House
officially... CoEd.

131
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,129
- No you can't.
- I can and I did.

132
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,132
Dean Bungalon
would never approve of this.

133
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,040
No. I doubt Dean Bungalon

134
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,368
would give approval
to such a dramatic change

135
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,237
to his old fraternity.

136
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,474
But luckly fraternity matters,

137
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,543
fall under the preview
of the Associate Dean.

138
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,679
Which is me.

139
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,145
This is bullshit!

140
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,196
- What's your name potty mouth?
- Cameron.

141
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,958
Is there something on
your feeble mind Cameron?

142
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,896
You can't just change
a frat like this. This isn't fair!

143
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,537
And having a Sorority
without a house is?

144
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,770
Excellent return Renee!

145
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,336
He means not fair to the girls.

146
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,700
It's still a frat.

147
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:32,968
You can bring a whole
bunch of girls in here

148
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,509
but they're gonna have to live
with a whole bunch of guys.

149
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,648
You think it's fair to make girls
live in that kind of environment?

150
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,020
Excellent point
Cameron's friend.

151
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,478
Zach.

152
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,989
Don't care.
With Alpha House being CoEd,

153
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,125
It is now written by state
and federal laws,

154
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,925
which forbid anyone

155
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:56,197
from making a member of
the opposite sex feel harassed,

156
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:01,071
disentranced, or
other wise uncomfortable.

157
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:06,805
It means you horn dogs
will dial down the debauchery.

158
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,675
Significantly.

159
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,514
How significantly?

160
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,544
This place is going to make the Mormon
tabernacle look like Mardi Gras.

161
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,949
Everybody will be
on their best behavior.

162
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,953
Or else, you're out.

163
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,460
Out of Alpha House?

164
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:28,166
Out of Alpha House.
Out of Sterling College.

165
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,799
Poop out of luck!

166
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,373
Ladies.

167
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,003
Why don't know go
make yourselves at home.

168
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:39,971
Girls.

169
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,313
Can someone please
buy some air freshener?

170
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,521
This is a disaster.

171
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:55,953
I'm outta here.

172
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,025
- Where you going?
- Sorry dudes.

173
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,694
I was only in this stupid frat only
for the booze and the cooze.

174
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,924
What about brotherhood?

175
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,971
What about never letting
the party die?

176
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,763
Dude, look around.

177
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,568
The party is dead.

178
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,909
I should be in elbows deep
in Co-Ed trim right now.

179
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,972
Instead of watching these
Delta Pi lesbos

180
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,172
turn our front door
into a chastity belt.

181
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,077
Adios losers.

182
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,816
Enjoy your castration.

183
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,549
Come on! Seriously guys!

184
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,748
Wait what?

185
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,518
Bye, bye.

186
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,588
Well...

187
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,962
Looks like you're the defecto
president potty mouth.

188
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,539
Congrats.

189
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,671
Alright, listen up.
This is how it's going to work.

190
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,470
You two are gonna divide
up the house equally.

191
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,908
I'm putting this on both
your shoulders.

192
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,972
- Got it?
- Got it.

193
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,316
Good.

194
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,013
So this is how it's gonna work.

195
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,451
You guys are gonna get
the rooms in the back,

196
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,855
and we get the rooms
in the front.

197
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:56,953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

198
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,684
You are talking to the acting
Alpha House president here.

199
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,828
Okay? If anybody decides
who gets what rooms is me.

200
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,097
Okay, so what do you suggest?

201
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,735
Girls in the front, guys in the back.

202
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,562
And you can share
your room with me.

203
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,141
I'll pass. How many bathrooms
are in this hell hole?

204
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,203
2 upstairs. 1 down here.

205
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,110
We each get one upstairs,
the one downstairs is for guests,

206
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,039
and the living room and
the kitchen are common areas.

207
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,841
- Does that work for you?
- Yes.

208
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,747
Make it so.

209
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,022
Right.

210
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,059
Who is that?

211
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:37,128
I am not sure but I think
she wants to fuck me!

212
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,555
That's not gonna happen.

213
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,594
Oh yeah we'll see
about that sweetie.

214
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,029
Oh. Melanie?

215
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,163
Zach.

216
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,471
Oh my god.

217
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,075
What are you doing here?

218
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,415
I just transferred.
I was over at state last semester.

219
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,048
Well hello there, smelanie.

220
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,517
Cameron. Wow.

221
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,913
Didn't miss that!

222
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,086
Melanie. Upstairs now.

223
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,849
- We're having a meeting.
- Okay.

224
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,391
Well, I guess I will be seeing you
around the house then?

225
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,928
Yeah, I guess so.

226
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,771
This place is repulsive.

227
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,031
Is that a used condom?

228
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,112
Ladies please!

229
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,442
I know these are not
the best of arrangements.

230
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,109
And no matter what those
cavemen downstairs think,

231
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,015
This place is as much our
as it is theirs.

232
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,787
The road is gonna be rough.

233
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,687
It's gonna be dirty.

234
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,891
And occasionally will have
a used condom in it.

235
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:43,996
But we can do this.

236
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,325
Sisters on 3.

237
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,039
- 1, 2, 3...
- This is bullshit! Alright.

238
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,573
We can't have chicks living here.

239
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,907
I totally agree.

240
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,101
Yo that brunette,

241
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,178
I'd love to have
her Canadian swirl,

242
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,848
on a ford bronco on 4 flat tires.

243
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,075
Dude, what?

244
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,585
- Makes zero sense dude.
- Look, guys this is our house!

245
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,949
Those girls are invaders
in our territory.

246
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,026
Cameron and I wanted to be Alpha's
for as long as I can remember,

247
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,929
and I am not throwing
that dream that the shitter

248
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,929
- because of some chicks.
- Me too dude but,

249
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,100
my dream did not include
a pussy embargo.

250
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,070
You guys are missing
the bigger picture here.

251
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,433
Did you see the talent that
just walked into this house?

252
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,503
At this moment
the rooms above our heads

253
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,714
are being stocked with
some pretty decent inventory.

254
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,475
This house is basically
a cosco full of vag, right?

255
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,018
And if we play our cards right,

256
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,282
we might be getting
some free samples!

257
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,923
Besides, how bad could it be
living with girls?

258
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,263
- What's going on?
- They're... cleaning.

259
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,363
Nice work ladies!

260
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,874
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

261
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,774
Just because you're comfortable
living like pigs

262
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,980
doesn't mean we have to be.

263
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,315
Pink! What the hell?

264
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,059
- What's going on?
- They're painted this room.

265
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,330
So?

266
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,960
They're painting this room... Pink!

267
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,637
I fucking hate pink.

268
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,206
I could get use
to the view though.

269
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,820
Though I definiely give them
both cherry twisters.

270
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,896
Enjoying the view?

271
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,135
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

272
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,274
- We were just...
- Right.

273
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,278
You know these paint fumes
are making me kinda dizzy.

274
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,486
Oh! Yeah me too.

275
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,119
You wanna...

276
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:06,892
Get outta here?

277
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,553
- Definitely
- Okay.

278
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,516
Bang-o-rang.

279
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,584
Thank you.

280
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,960
Where you going?
Where you going?

281
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,192
Where you going?

282
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,737
Perv!

283
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,099
- I'm going to kill you.
- Feisty! I like that!

284
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,112
I like that! Help me.

285
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,302
What happened?

286
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,810
I caught jersey shore here

287
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,347
staring at me
through my bedroom door!

288
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,108
Whoa! Kiss my taint, alright?

289
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,911
I am way cooler then those
Jersey Shore douchebags!

290
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,114
I'm taking this to Marshall!

291
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,950
Whoa! Okay!
Pause right there alright.

292
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,784
Nobody has to take anything
to Dean Marshall.

293
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,930
How about, You promise to stay
in your part if the house

294
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,826
and we'll promise to stay in ours.

295
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,761
But... but we get
the basement, okay?

296
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,469
You guys got to go all Martha Stewart
on the rest of the house.

297
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,072
We get one place that's
just ours just like we like it.

298
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,207
Deal?

299
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,579
If I catch you
looking at me again,

300
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,177
I'm turning your balls
into a keychain.

301
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,610
Is that a promise?

302
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,877
I love her.

303
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,124
What?

304
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,828
They're taking this place over.

305
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,132
Then what the fuck
are we doing about it?!

306
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:58,364
Cause I am one
ass hair away from leaving.

307
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,337
We do what we do best.

308
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,971
- And that would be?
- We be guys.

309
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,475
We do everything we can to run
the Deltas out of this place.

310
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,874
And back to the lecture hall
from where they came.

311
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,709
Then we take Alpha house
back for ourselves.

312
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,074
What about Marshall's big plan?

313
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,913
What's he gonna do about it
if they leave voluntary?

314
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,214
What about the bitchy one?

315
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,084
Leave her to me.

316
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:20,958
You boy ready for this?

317
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,387
- Oh yeah.
- Good.

318
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,998
We start at sun up.

319
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,201
Wake up! Wake up!

320
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,206
No shirt. Let's go! Get out!
No shirt! Nope!

321
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,657
Listen up recruits!

322
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,090
As acting president of Alpha House
it's my resposibility,

323
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,599
Strike that.

324
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:02,991
My pleasure

325
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,970
to ensure that you have
the proper induction in this

326
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,636
most honorable institution.

327
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,300
Being an Alpha
is a goddamn privilege.

328
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,011
A god damn privillage!

329
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,476
And like any privilege it's earned
through hard work.

330
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,845
- Is that right gentlemen?
- Hoo-rah!

331
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,310
Give me a break.

332
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,216
New recruits will as for permission
before speaking to the president!

333
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,481
Speak to this!

334
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,050
What is your name, recruit?

335
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,396
Kelly Kramer.

336
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,755
- Do you have a middle name?
- Fuck off.

337
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,633
Oh. Pretty.

338
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,332
People call you K2?

339
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,829
- Nobody calls me...
- Here's the deal K2.

340
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,168
Just as generations
of Alphas before you.

341
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,977
You and your little femme
bots here

342
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,637
are going to have
to endure some...

343
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,215
minor inconveniences

344
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,252
to demonstrate you are worthy
for a spot in this house.

345
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,853
If any of you can't handle it,

346
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,586
you are welcome to leave.

347
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:03,987
Bring it shit weasel.

348
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,826
Play your little games.

349
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,191
Get that frat bullshit
out of your system.

350
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,369
But guess what,
we're still gonna be here.

351
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:13,970
Are we done?

352
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,641
You are dismissed.

353
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,601
Whatever. Girls.

354
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,075
That didn't go as planned.

355
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,905
No it did not.

356
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,284
They have to leave!

357
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,047
Oh they will.

358
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,216
I have a plan.

359
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,601
- Excuse me ladies.
- Hey!

360
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,064
- I'm so sorry.
- Dude!

361
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,804
- We were watching that.
- We are watching this now.

362
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:50,264
Oh god!

363
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,574
And this is how they pay
for college.

364
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,007
Alright K2. You have a choice
of "Hole filled with cock",

365
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,446
Brazilian Whores in Vegas.
Looks like that won an award,

366
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,246
or white men can hump.

367
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,524
Oh sorry,
don't have a TV in my room.

368
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,789
Oh no problem. Boys!

369
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,596
- Go to go boss.
- Good. Thank you.

370
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,156
Alright!
White men can hump it is!

371
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,731
Alright let's get those
tits bouncing!

372
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,127
Nice!

373
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,035
- Home movie?
- Uh sorry.

374
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,407
It's part of... you know.

375
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,309
It's alright hey I might
even learn a thing or two.

376
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,419
I...

377
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,481
Gotta go.

378
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,820
This is not why
I joined your stupid sorority.

379
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,498
Change is never easy Renee.

380
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,270
We're not about to let
some smutty videos break us.

381
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,564
We will persevere.

382
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,068
Hello ladies!

383
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,073
We got a treat for you.
Hand out the shirts.

384
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,577
What is this?

385
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,773
Oh we thought that the house
could use a little more solidarity.

386
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,745
So what each and everyone one
of you is going to do

387
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,648
is think of the sluttiest thing
you have ever done on the first date

388
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,448
write it on the shirt
and wear it to dinner.

389
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,859
- No way!
- Why not? Come on!

390
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:15,958
We're doing it too.

391
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,192
See. Solidarity!

392
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,299
Besides president's orders,
right Cameron?

393
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,697
- Fucking A!
- See you all at dinner.

394
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,339
I'm not doing this.

395
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,404
Yes you are. We all are.

396
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,407
Think of all the women who stood up
for what they believe is right.

397
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,781
Elizabeth Blackwell.

398
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,350
- Susie B. Anthony.
- Snooky!

399
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,013
If those women could endure
all they had to go through,

400
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,322
surely we can endure this!

401
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,184
Right ladies?

402
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,954
All of you start writing.

403
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,963
And be truthful.

404
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,193
We wouldn't want
to compromise our integrity.

405
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,173
Jessica.

406
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,977
I said be truthful.

407
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:07,980
Shit.

408
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,595
Here.

409
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:25,992
I made these for you.

410
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,641
Dude! I don't know
what the fuck this is!

411
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,443
Oh relax! Right.

412
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,050
I'm on it.

413
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,322
Is it working?

414
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,799
Alright. Titty cam number one
is ready for it's broadcast day.

415
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:03,991
Sweet.

416
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,328
Let's roll!

417
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,139
Right there. There.

418
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,988
Perfection.

419
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,484
Namaste.

420
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,173
No, no, no. Hold it!

421
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,019
Let's do another one.

422
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:36,962
Jackpot!

423
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,393
So don't want to go
to psych class today.

424
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,422
Hey how was history yesterday?

425
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,761
Fuck the feminist movement.

426
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,866
Turn around. Turn around.

427
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,864
They make the Disney princess
seem like they're bad.

428
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,040
I mean, "Hello?
They get everything they wanted."

429
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,614
- What the fuck is that?
- Bigfoot.

430
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,244
Hey did you see that?

431
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,011
Assholes!

432
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,321
Zach, you have to check out
this footage.

433
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:08,961
It's totally epic.

434
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,525
- Maybe later guys.
- Titties.

435
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,028
- Hey there.
- Fuck! Can a guy get some...

436
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,808
Hi.

437
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,437
Studying huh?

438
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,707
- Trying to.
- Just like old times.

439
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,317
You remember our first date?

440
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,746
7th grade... after school
you asked me to meet you...

441
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,189
- In the library.
- Right.

442
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,361
You said you wanted me to help you
with your history assignment

443
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,757
but I seem to remember
what you really wanted

444
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,626
was to feel my boobs.

445
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,092
Under the sweater over the bra
if I remember correctly.

446
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,534
Oh you remember.

447
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,739
- So what are you studying now?
- Oh.

448
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,434
History.

449
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,005
You don't say.

450
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,576
I'll let you get to it.

451
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,648
We should shower together
more often.

452
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,324
Yeah, it's so much fun.

453
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,853
It's good for the environment.

454
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,163
- It is.
- I know!

455
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,099
- Helping bunnies.
- Yeah!

456
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,072
Some perverts!

457
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,272
Do you have to be
such an asshole?

458
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,277
I think you mean
president asshole.

459
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,980
I'm taking this to the Dean.

460
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,724
Ya'll would love to get her
Alabama hot pocket.

461
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,394
I have no idea what that means.

462
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,852
I'll tell you about it later.

463
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,959
Stop making that. Stop.

464
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,308
- I'm on the phone!
- I'm going to lunch.

465
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,075
Be back by one!

466
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,042
Try three.

467
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,680
Yes. Yes.

468
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,855
Well I look forward to speaking
about Virgin Mary more as well.

469
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,917
Yes. Yes. Alpha House project
is moving forward.

470
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:24,989
Students are getting along.

471
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,330
No, no, no, no, complaints.

472
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,066
And uh if there are
there's always provision 13.

473
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,378
If we have to use it
we most definitely will.

474
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,278
Listen up ladies,
the game has changed.

475
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,617
Before you know it we're gonna
have this house all to ourselves.

476
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,478
- How?
- Like this.

477
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,382
What are you doing?

478
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,489
What we have to do
to take this house.

479
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,986
Saddle up girls.

480
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,195
It's time to blow some minds.

481
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,198
Hey Cameron.

482
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,103
- Hey.
- Hey what's up K2.

483
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,037
Um, I just really wanted
to apologize

484
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,579
for the way
I have been acting lately.

485
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,948
- Really?
- Yeah, you know.

486
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,075
I know it must be weird

487
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,820
being forced to live
with a whole bunch of women.

488
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,922
It's a lot to take in all at once.

489
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,952
That's cool.
We've been having fun.

490
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,690
Yeah, totally. Us too.

491
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,897
Anyways, the girls and I kinda want
to offer you a peace offering.

492
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,995
- Oh. A peace offering?
- Yeah.

493
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,863
You know, for all the trouble
we caused you.

494
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,768
It's the least we can do.

495
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,244
So... dinner tonight
at the house.

496
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,876
- On us?
- Sure. Sounds good.

497
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,072
Perfect. I'll see you then.

498
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,812
And remember to dress nice.

499
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,519
We got something
really special planned.

500
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,521
Alright.

501
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,952
- See ya.
- Okay, bye.

502
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,597
God.

503
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,008
Good evening gentlemen.

504
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,243
We your alpha sisters
would like to thank you

505
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,883
for welcoming us
so warmly into your home.

506
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,946
As a token of our gratitude,

507
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,487
we prepared a very special meal
for you tonight.

508
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,125
One that I think you'll remember
for a very long time.

509
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,728
Please take a seat.

510
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,356
Enjoy your dinner boys.

511
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,599
I don't know about you fellas
but I am famished.

512
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,943
Time for stage 2.

513
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,649
Yes.
Associate Dean Marshall please.

514
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,798
Don't you like what you see?

515
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,992
Everything looks delicious.

516
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,728
Help yourself.

517
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,604
No, no, no, no.

518
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,209
No! No, no, no, no.

519
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,316
Relax Relax. Okay.

520
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,237
Do you have any wasabi?

521
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,262
Of course.

522
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,759
Bang-o-rang.

523
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,131
Dude, they're just boobs.

524
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,235
No, no, no, no. He's chocking!

525
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,671
- Oh my god!
- Does anybody know the heimlich?

526
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,246
Everybody relax, I'm a lifeguard.

527
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,846
Careful.

528
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,052
- Geez are you okay?
- Am I okay? Look at my face!

529
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,996
- Asshole!
- What's going on?

530
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,734
Oh.

531
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:54,048
I'd say I was disappointed,
that doesn't quite cover.

532
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,186
- Disrespected Irate Melancholy...
- Pissed off!

533
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,760
- I think does it.
- It's a good one.

534
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,196
Because of your antics,

535
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,803
and heinous treatment of sushi

536
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,235
I've been forced to expel
members of your fraternity

537
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,441
for indecency and fraternization.

538
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,041
And I particularly expected
more from you Ms. Kramer.

539
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,636
- Me too.
- Shut up potty mouth.

540
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,276
I'm so sorry Sir.
It won't happen again.

541
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,749
Good.

542
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,952
Because I will not hesitate

543
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,524
to put each and everyone of you
out in the street,

544
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,954
if you cannot follow the rules.

545
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,157
That is all.

546
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,231
I'm so sorry.

547
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,600
Edgar's gone.

548
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,641
So, what are we done?

549
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,706
We're just getting started.

550
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,979
We dial it up a notch.

551
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,976
We just can't get caught
in the process.

552
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,953
One man eliminated, but now...

553
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,488
we've lost two of our own.

554
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,649
That was sloppy.

555
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,094
From now on we play smarter.

556
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,355
We play harder.

557
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,758
We can't afford to have
anymore casualties.

558
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:15,971
That's awesome.

559
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,812
Chuckie, you sure
it's gonna work?

560
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,006
Dude, please. I switched
the DVDs this morning.

561
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,315
Well... This is
going to be educational.

562
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,495
Good afternoon.

563
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,728
My presentation
is on Pompeii.

564
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,266
In 79 A.D. the Italian city
of Pompeii was destroyed

565
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,736
by the sudden
and devastating eruption

566
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,102
of Mount Vesuvius.

567
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,680
For centuries before
this ruin however,

568
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,084
Pompeii was
a thriving metropolis

569
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,918
A place of wealth
and abundance.

570
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,784
In fact, it's citizens produced
works of art,

571
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,148
dance and music.

572
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,652
Still admired till this day.

573
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,084
You don't say.

574
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,396
Thanks.

575
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Little did the people know
the dangers lurking

576
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,600
in the peeks
and mountains near by.

577
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,273
Shit!

578
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,721
Stop!

579
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,293
I'm gonna kill your children
and your children's children.

580
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,470
Uh! Come on!

581
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,072
Fuck!

582
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,053
So, Abby seems
to think you guys

583
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,957
have something to do
with her presentation...

584
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,257
I assure you
we had nothing to do

585
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,756
with the destruction of Pompeii.

586
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,288
Whatever.

587
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,967
I'm sorry that Edgar
got kicked out last night.

588
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,661
Yeah.

589
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,439
Same about Jessica and Katie.

590
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,944
Who would have thought
that Associate Dean Douchebag

591
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,377
was actually a man of his word.

592
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:40,314
Still not sure why he showed up
at that exact moment though.

593
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,012
It's bad luck I guess.

594
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,678
Hey.

595
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,487
Do you remember
that night in High School

596
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,351
when we were in
Johnny Peterson's basement

597
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:53,030
and you threw up
all over his coffee table?

598
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,096
Oh! Yes.

599
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,126
I told his mom
I was sick with the flu.

600
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,002
Did not have the heart to tell her
that we got into his dad's liquor.

601
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,240
Yeah, I drank you
under the table that night.

602
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,236
- What?!
- I'm just saying

603
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,307
you are kind of a lightweight.

604
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,842
- Oh really?
- Really.

605
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,110
Really.

606
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,037
Really?

607
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:16,520
Ladies and Gentlemen
welcome to sit or strip.

608
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,786
The rules are simple.
You flip this coin

609
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,116
and call it in the air.
You're right, you take a shot.

610
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,087
Get it wrong, you remove an article
of clothing and take a shot.

611
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,431
If you pass out
or end up naked you're out.

612
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,068
- The last man...
- Uh...

613
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,005
or woman...

614
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,073
standing wins the game.

615
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,064
There are no prizes.

616
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,676
This is simply a challenge
to determine the better sex.

617
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,972
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

618
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,516
- I said are you fucking ready?
- Yeah!

619
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,252
Good! Let the games begin.

620
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,944
- Tails.
- Tails! Tails! Tails!

621
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:02,725
Alright!

622
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,614
So beating you right now.

623
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,675
Alright. Then let's finish this.

624
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,913
Heads.

625
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,673
Easy now.

626
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,441
- I want a rematch.
- Okay lie back.

627
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,880
Because you are very,
very drunk right now.

628
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,921
We can't do this.

629
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,485
Zach.

630
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,491
Hey.

631
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:28,964
Light Weight.

632
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,349
So, what is it this time?

633
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:57,962
What am I doing here?

634
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,598
How did I get here?

635
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:00,962
You pig!

636
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,178
What the hell is going on here?

637
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,980
Exactly what I said what happen

638
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,746
when one of your boys
cross the line.

639
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,246
- What? No body...
- I found them

640
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,046
with a few of my girls
in their rooms.

641
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,451
Oh! Sounds pretty
consensual to me.

642
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,193
No, it sound like you conspired
to get them drunk

643
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,550
so you can take
advantage of them.

644
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,158
Oh! Horse shit!

645
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,387
You were there!

646
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,768
I suggest you boys begin
adhering to the rules.

647
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,872
Otherwise, You'll all be looking
for a new home.

648
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,409
Kelly is gonna wipe us out
if we don't get some help.

649
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,673
I think I know just the person.

650
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,039
Yo. Who is that?

651
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,242
That my boys
is my cousin Natalie.

652
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,673
She's our inside man.

653
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:18,604
Cameron.

654
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,851
Boys.

655
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:22,844
I heard you need some help.

656
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,352
Yeah, you have no idea.

657
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,150
Come on, baby.
What about that?

658
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,690
Oh yeah.

659
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,636
God!

660
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,934
- Dean Marshall
- I am busy Stephanie!

661
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,570
- He's busy.
- I don't give a rat's ass!

662
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,978
Marshall! What the devil
are you up to?

663
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,438
Dean Bungalon.

664
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,616
I'm not quite sure
what you are referring to.

665
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,018
Alpha House?

666
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,017
You're trying to launch
some kind of CoEd program?

667
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,451
Yes yes, the uh first of it's
kind in the state in fact.

668
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,359
Very progressive.

669
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,497
And certainly within
my remit as Associate Dean.

670
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:09,997
But I hear it has resulted

671
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,801
in the ejection of some students
from the faternity.

672
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,631
Yes, it's an unfortunate
but necessary.

673
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,068
My ass.

674
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,173
I cannot for the life
of me figure out

675
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,105
why you would think
is a good idea

676
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,306
to put a bunch of sexed up
young adults under one roof.

677
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,412
What did you think
was going to happen?

678
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,952
The benefits of the program
far out way the risks.

679
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:32,884
Making the Greek system
CoEd fosters a unity

680
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,515
between the genders,
and offers for a more...

681
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,993
cohesive living situation.

682
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,493
But no fraternization
with the opposite sex?

683
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,334
You're suppressing
their natural urges.

684
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,359
- Hell when I was an Alpha...
- Yes. Yes. We...

685
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,864
all know about the old days
when you were went Greek sir.

686
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:54,069
The point is students come
to Sterling College

687
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,106
to learn and to have fun.

688
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,408
Not to be put into some
social experiment.

689
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,208
I appreciate your concern sir.

690
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:04,116
I don't know
what your end game is Marshall,

691
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:08,250
But if I get a call that this
little plan of yours went tits up...

692
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,659
It's your ass.

693
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,327
- Not mine.
- Tits up my ass.

694
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:14,929
Got it.

695
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,997
Will there be anything else? Sir?

696
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,458
No.

697
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,262
Carry on with um...

698
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,266
Whatever it is that you do in here.

699
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,283
Ladies. This is Natalie.

700
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,008
She just transferred to Sterling.

701
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,913
So please make her feel at home.

702
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,289
- Hi Natalie.
- Hey

703
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,283
- I'm Emery.
- I'm Allison.

704
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,590
- Any progress with Kelly?
- No progress there.

705
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,352
That is wrapped tighter then
a condom on Peter North's dick.

706
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,825
Just keep on trying to break
that hymen okay?

707
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,899
If you see any opportunity
to take some leverage, take it.

708
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,002
Roger that.

709
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:39,797
I love you cousin.

710
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,076
I need you to do
some research for me.

711
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,313
I think we have a double agent
in our midst.

712
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,281
Find out everything you can
from that new girl Natalie.

713
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,618
I'm on it.

714
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,644
Time to turn up the heat.

715
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,089
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
Okay not-not in here.

716
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,962
This is our basement okay?
This is our territory.

717
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,336
Haven't you heard
about burlesquercise?

718
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,204
Okay but...

719
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,683
5 minutes.

720
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,118
Umm, you could make it 10.

721
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,736
Yeah go sexy.

722
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,037
Yeah.

723
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,510
Oh.

724
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,121
I think I want more.

725
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,255
Alright.

726
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:21,986
Yeah baby.

727
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:23,983
There we go.

728
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,522
Sexy!

729
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,930
- Oh shit!
- Oh!

730
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,000
What is going on in here?

731
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,198
So close.

732
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,995
Dude, we should all
just leave the house, okay?

733
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,465
We're dropping like flies.

734
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,603
I wish I could get Allison
to drop her pants.

735
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,438
I bet her cooz is like fine china.

736
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,505
Dude, now
you're just being creepy.

737
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,446
Guys we can do this.

738
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,144
We're Alpha's for Christ sake!

739
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,284
Alright, we'll wear them down.
You'll see.

740
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,492
Umm... You okay?

741
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,927
We're not going to make it.

742
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,137
Not with you girls walking around
the house flaunting your goods.

743
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,431
Flaunting our goods?

744
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,071
We're not built
to defend against this.

745
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,971
It's like you're actually
trying to get us tossed out.

746
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,077
All I ever wanted
is to be an Alpha.

747
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,319
What are you doing?

748
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,788
Flaunting my goods.

749
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,496
Feeling better?

750
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,591
Ah... Yeah.

751
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,870
I need to tell you something.

752
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:51,770
You're right about us.

753
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,068
Kelly is trying to take over
Alpha House

754
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,670
and turn it into a sorority.

755
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,414
What? How?

756
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,050
It's something called
provision 13.

757
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,919
It states that if the ratio of
either gender falls below 40%

758
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,960
the gender that has the majority,
has control.

759
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,258
That's why you guys
have been getting kicked out

760
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,988
so that we have the majority.

761
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,001
We've been playing you
the entire time.

762
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:22,999
I'm sorry.

763
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,116
You asshole!

764
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,051
You crossed enemy lines!

765
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,914
I can't believe
you're fucking her!

766
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,115
- Smelenie! Of all of them.
- It was just once!

767
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,185
And a half.

768
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,498
Okay. Look.

769
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,627
I am sorry that I punched you.

770
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,563
But you fucking deserve it,
you know that?

771
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,669
- I know.
- Shit!

772
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:57,541
Shit!

773
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,271
So what do we do now huh?
Big guy!

774
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,002
I have an idea.

775
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,921
Alright sneak
into Dean Marshall's office,

776
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,648
and find out whatever we can
about this prevision 13 bullshit

777
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,693
and use it against the girls.
Shit security!

778
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,385
- Go, go, go!
- What are you doing?

779
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,272
Okay let's do this.
Quick in and quick out.

780
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,710
- Like your mama?
- Dick.

781
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:41,952
Okay.

782
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:47,556
You finding anything?

783
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:48,956
No!

784
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,656
Dude, dude, dude check it out!

785
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:54,953
What!?

786
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,194
Got it. Alright now let's rub
our balls all over his office.

787
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:02,732
- Dibs on his phone!
- Okay!

788
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:06,877
Shit!

789
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,311
Shit! Come on, come on, come on.

790
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:15,716
I want you to fuck me
on my freak boss's desk.

791
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,652
Treat me like a bad girl.

792
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,516
You're such a freak wanting
to do it in Marshall's office.

793
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,025
Enjoy it while it's here baby.

794
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,023
Marshall's gon his eye
on the Dean position

795
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,700
at Virgin Mary College.

796
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:36,962
Prestige. Expensive.
And all girls.

797
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,975
Why do you think he came up
with that freak idea

798
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,107
to CoEd all the fraternities.

799
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,843
He had to show
his commitment in order to seal...

800
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,744
the... deal.

801
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,619
Marshall is such a fucking freak.

802
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,147
He only wants that job
so he can flirt with college girls.

803
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:55,683
Flip.

804
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,497
Gentlemen.

805
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,628
We are not gonna sit idly by

806
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:08,669
and watch our beloved fraternities
be stolen from beneath our feet.

807
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,072
From this night forward,
we do everything in our powers

808
01:00:11,073 --> 01:00:12,633
to stop the advancement of Kelly

809
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,035
and the monkey dick lover
that we know

810
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,079
- as Associate Dean douchebag.
- How?

811
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,512
Well...

812
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,876
Enough with the drawings.
Just tell them the plan.

813
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:25,214
Well first we vow not
to touch the poon.

814
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:29,288
So keep it in your pants.
Then, those lying,

815
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,287
disingenuous,

816
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,696
fragalent, mendacious, perfidious

817
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,028
whores at their own game.

818
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,068
Who's with us?

819
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,400
Ladies and Gentleman.

820
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:48,668
Welcome to Greek Charity days

821
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:51,106
where all proceeds
earned by students

822
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,907
are donated to the charity
of every fraternity

823
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,813
and sororities choice.

824
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,891
Yep. No exactly the turn out
I was expecting.

825
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:09,623
- But it's... Pretty shitty.
- Yeah it's pretty shitty

826
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,368
The girls seem to be
doing pretty well.

827
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,267
Suspiciously well.

828
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,003
Come and get your kisses!

829
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,815
- Dude give me $10 dollars.
- Dude stop it. Alright.

830
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,020
Hey everyone...

831
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,951
- Look!
- Give money to Chair Titty Day!

832
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,824
Oh are you gonna squirt me
with your big gun?

833
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,802
That will be $75 dollars.

834
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,604
Thanks.

835
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,172
You think you can score?

836
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,942
- Dude we are in trouble man.
- Big trouble.

837
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,487
- Zach.
- Uh Zach?

838
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,648
- Zach who?
- Oh come on Cameron.

839
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:12,987
Oh! Zach!
He's not here. Do you see him?

840
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,533
Really?
You're that pissed at me?

841
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,135
He says that you lied to him
and that he was bad at the sex.

842
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,634
What did you expect me to do?

843
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,441
I'm trying to fit in.
Be part of the group. Just like you.

844
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,044
You would have done
the same thing.

845
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,307
Probably already have.

846
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,182
He says he has nothing else
to say to you.

847
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,008
Well I have nothing else
to say to him either.

848
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:36,844
Dude she's cute.

849
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,052
We need to figure something out.
We need to...

850
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:39,987
- Decent body too.
- We need to get serious!

851
01:02:39,988 --> 01:02:42,049
Hey I have a question if you're
ever done with her you think...

852
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,491
Cam!

853
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,528
- You like her!
- Shut up.

854
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,392
You like Smelanie!
I fucking knew it.

855
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,731
Hey guys Zach like Melanie.

856
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,165
Oh okay,
you get one more of those

857
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,038
and I swear to Christ I'm gonna
punch you right in the gooch.

858
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,604
What you got?

859
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,673
- Almost finished.
- Check it out.

860
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,051
- Nice.
- And the website?

861
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,547
Ready to roll.

862
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:16,092
5 bucks a day
keep the blue balls away.

863
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,149
Make it 10.

864
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,488
We're getting creamed out there.

865
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,562
- 10 it is.
- Come back time.

866
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:33,802
I know that Kelly is in this
whole empowerment thing but,

867
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,808
I kinda just want to rage and...

868
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,208
get some dick, you know?

869
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,072
Shit.

870
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,727
Hey Rene can you move
to the right a bit?

871
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:52,962
Why?

872
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:58,031
I wanted to get a better look
at your bra. It's really nice.

873
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,269
- You think so?
- Yeah can I see it?

874
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,801
Yeah. I finally splurged
and got myself some nice ones.

875
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:06,974
Here you go.

876
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,470
Perfecto.

877
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:11,272
It is nice.

878
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,813
I love your cousin.

879
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,679
Touch her and I'll kill you man.

880
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:16,953
Literally.

881
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,852
- It's cute.
- It would get me dick.

882
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,114
It definiteluy would.

883
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,528
Nice job boys.

884
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,154
We have a problem.
Camera 7 is offline.

885
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,556
- Which one is that?
- The one in K2's room.

886
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,899
Shit you think she found it?

887
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,434
I don't know.
If she did she'd be in here

888
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,071
cutting our dicks off, right?
Wouldn't she?

889
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,073
Oh fuck.

890
01:04:59,128 --> 01:04:59,993
Dude, so how much
we made so far?

891
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,755
- $12,000 dollars.
- What?

892
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,091
Yeah, and that's
just the first day dude.

893
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,301
I'm telling you Zach
if we keep going like this

894
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,069
we're gonna be able
to buy our own fraternity.

895
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,367
Hey February!

896
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,636
Dude that's like the 3rd time
that's happened to me today.

897
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,074
- What? Called you February?
- Yeah, weird right?

898
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,232
Yeah.

899
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,104
Hello boys.

900
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,045
You'd like your copies
autographed?

901
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,550
Ladies, there's plenty me
to go around.

902
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,146
Um exactly
what am I autographing?

903
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,353
This.

904
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,450
Oh shit!

905
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,249
What happened to my dick?

906
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,959
I know. I'm so sorry.

907
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,397
This is not what I look like!
This is not what I look like!

908
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,822
I have a friend that's really good
at photo editing.

909
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:37,964
Give me that.

910
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:42,637
Mine's crooked!

911
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,363
Actually it's a perfect right angle.

912
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,068
- My dick does not look like this!
- Dude calm down.

913
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:50,103
No. No I will not calm down!

914
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:51,481
I need the world to know that

915
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,845
I don't have a god damn
90 degree penius!

916
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,118
In fact, I'm gonna show
every body!

917
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,254
Dude keep your pants on.
Keep your pants on.

918
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,054
- This is not over.
- Not yet.

919
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:01,984
- Come on. No.
- I wanna show'em.

920
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,923
- Kelly.
- What's wrong?

921
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,492
I got the research you asked
for on Natalie.

922
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:07,994
Cousins?!

923
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,947
Leverage.

924
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,550
Kelly?

925
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:39,962
Are you there
you bad, bad girl?

926
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,501
What are you guys
doing here?

927
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,005
We got the note from Kelly
and said she wanted to party.

928
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,669
Shit. We've been set up.

929
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,065
Come on we have
to get out of here.

930
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,437
Oh my god!

931
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,446
What are you doing in my room?

932
01:06:59,015 --> 01:06:59,983
With drugs!

933
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,612
And fetish wear.

934
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,944
I told you
they were out of control.

935
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,121
Well Dean Bungalon,

936
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,083
I think you will agree
there really is no choice here.

937
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,356
I agree.

938
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:19,733
Gentlemen.

939
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:21,938
Madam.

940
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,132
You're out!

941
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:26,142
Dude.

942
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,004
Well, that's it then

943
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,579
without these 2 the guys
have less the 40%.

944
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,781
And even without
Miss lady pain here,

945
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,108
we've still got the majority.

946
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,214
Alpha House is ours!

947
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,090
You know it didn't have
to be this way.

948
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,997
We could have changed
Sterling College for the better.

949
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,036
We could have found a way
to live together as equals.

950
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:59,002
But instead you had to sow
the seeds of discontent.

951
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:00,902
And you know what happened,

952
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:04,011
you rapped
the fucking world wind!

953
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,444
That's what happen!

954
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,414
You're sexy when
you're megalomaniacal.

955
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,946
Laugh it up frodo.

956
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,050
But tonight I'll be sleeping
in my nice warm bed.

957
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,061
In this very house.

958
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,124
Where will you be sleeping?

959
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,294
Oh well it's Tuesday so that
would be with your mom!

960
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:30,605
Oh!

961
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,004
Later losers.

962
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:37,873
Come on ladies let's go.

963
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:41,849
I'm really sorry boys.

964
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,446
I wish there was something
I could do.

965
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,689
Yeah, yeah me too but um...

966
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,055
Unfortunately
my hands are tide.

967
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,753
Yeah I'm sure.

968
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,151
Come on guys.

969
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,214
I brought all the paperwork
to officially turn Alpha House

970
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:14,917
in the Delta Pi Sorority.

971
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,846
All you have to do
is sign right here.

972
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,922
Is there something wrong?

973
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:26,289
I'm afraid we are going
in a different direction.

974
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:31,832
You see, CoEd fraternity project
was meant to showcase

975
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,027
how Sterling College fosters
productive interacting

976
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,363
between the genders.

977
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:39,202
I'm sure you will agree it was
an unmitigated disaster.

978
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:42,076
I don't understand.
What about provision 13?

979
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,577
Give you the fraternity?

980
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,475
Oh I don't know?
Why don't I also open up a brothel?

981
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,079
After what you girls did?

982
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:54,888
Oh I don't think so.

983
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,117
I did what you told me to do.

984
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,087
Can you prove that?

985
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,696
Oh! I don't think so.

986
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,128
You have 24 hours
to vacate Alpha House.

987
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,064
That is all.

988
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:27,953
Girls.

989
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,286
We need to talk.

990
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,729
- Alpha is no longer a fraternity.
- Yeah no shit!

991
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,930
You made sure
of that cruela devil.

992
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,134
We were just following
Marshall's orders.

993
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:42,268
He told me he wanted to show

994
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,439
how he was a big supporter
of female empowerment

995
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,475
by turning those sexist fraternity
on campus into sorority.

996
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,609
But in the end he just
wanted to shut it down.

997
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,241
- And he used us to do it.
- Wait? Shut it down?

998
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,474
Completely. Abandon.
Boarded up.

999
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,946
We're just as homeless
as you are.

1000
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,051
I know that
I don't deserve this.

1001
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,414
That we don't deserve this
after what we did but,

1002
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,686
We can't back and
watch Alpha House disappear.

1003
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,951
- What we?
- Yes we!

1004
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,194
That dickweed needs
to get what's coming to him.

1005
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,026
Nobody crosses
Kelly Dorothy Kramer.

1006
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,269
- Dorothy.
- Shut up!

1007
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,771
Now you're gonna help us
get Alpha House back or what?

1008
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,999
I don't know. You did already
break our trust once.

1009
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,004
Please.

1010
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,703
We'll do anything.

1011
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,415
Anything?

1012
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,831
Looking good ladies.

1013
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,130
We're in. Admin Building 2pm.

1014
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,537
And don't feel the need to change
in the count of us, okay?

1015
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,979
I'm sorry but there
is absolutely nothing I could do

1016
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,106
to over turn Associate
Dean Marshall's decision.

1017
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:00,672
What about the Alpha Creed?

1018
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,747
Yeah! Once and Alpha
always an Alpha!

1019
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,052
I really wish I could help you.

1020
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,385
Thank you sir
we really appreciate your time.

1021
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,486
Of course...

1022
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:15,188
If Marshall was to lose his position
with the administration,

1023
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,963
all of his policies
would be reviewed.

1024
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:20,333
Wh... wait a minute
are you saying that

1025
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,232
if we get Dean Marshall
kicked out of the college

1026
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,134
that we might be able
to get Alpha House back?

1027
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,973
Well the reason for his dismissal
would have to be something...

1028
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:31,005
pretty F'n dishonorable.
Something so scandalous

1029
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,647
that the college
would disown all of his decisions.

1030
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,678
Just to distance itself from him.

1031
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,417
Dishonorable.

1032
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,287
Scandalous.

1033
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:41,947
We'll do it.

1034
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:46,085
Of course this conversation
never happened.

1035
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,488
Of course. Thank you Dean.

1036
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,996
Once an Alpha always an Alpha.

1037
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,870
Cameron, you take a team
into Marshall's office.

1038
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,008
Place cameras here, here, here.

1039
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:01,299
Roger that.

1040
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,804
Once you're in, be fast.
In and out.

1041
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,777
But make sure the cameras
are invisible. Undetectable.

1042
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,076
We need full coverage.

1043
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,251
Right there. Right there.

1044
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,247
Go, go, go, go!

1045
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,544
Come on let's go!

1046
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,382
Whatever he does in that office
we need to see it.

1047
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:17,651
What do you think we'll find?

1048
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,455
I don't know but based on
what his assistant said

1049
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,994
probably some freaky ass shit.

1050
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,011
Did he us ask
to get fucked in the ass

1051
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,808
by a chick wearing
a squirrel costume?

1052
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,079
Yeah I think so.

1053
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,913
I think I just puked
in my mouth a little.

1054
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,611
What are we gonna do with
all this Intel after we gather it?

1055
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,213
We bait the trap.

1056
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,726
Stephanie. I see you're working.

1057
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,358
What's this?

1058
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,340
Oh, oh, oh my.

1059
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,179
I'm going to lunch.

1060
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:16,741
Whatever.

1061
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,036
What's the password?

1062
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,606

I am honored to be speaking
in front of you today.

1102
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:41,323
I am particularly
grateful to provostalious

1103
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,685
and the other Virgin Mary
administrators

1104
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:46,054
for making time in their very busy
schedules to be here today.

1105
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:47,193
Thank you.

1106
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,298
Through out my tenure
at Sterling College,

1107
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:55,195
I am most proud of how
I fought for equal gender rights.

1108
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:57,970
Although I did not achieved
the level of success

1109
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:00,837
I had hope with my most
recent project.

1110
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,012
The rehabilitation
of Sterling College's

1111
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:08,308
most notorious
and disrespected fraternity.

1112
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,254
I swear to you
on my nana's graves

1113
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,981
I will continue the gender fight

1114
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:19,052
until I have serviced the needs
of every female student.

1115
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,292
That is so gross.

1116
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,163
That proffer my resignation

1117
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,832

1118
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,193

...And accept the position
of Dean of Virgin Mary University.

1120
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,575
Drop it.

1121
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:36,976

He's not gonna like this.

1124
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,952
As well as inserting my rigid ethics

1125
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,388
in the lives of your most
impressive student body.

1126
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,357
- It's him right?
- Yeah. That's him.

1127
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,122

Don't! Don't please.

1136
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:23,157
It's not me.

1137
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,350
Save it Marshall.

1138
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,656
You're not who
we thought you were.

1139
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:29,998
There's no place for you
at Virgin Mary College after all.

1140
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,358
Furry freak...

1141
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:32,828

1154
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,104
To never let the kegs go dry.

1155
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,011
And to never...

1156
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,643

01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,984
I have to say when I told you guys

1164
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,117
I wasn't expecting this.

1165
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,920
Well sir it was a full team effort.

1166
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:09,528
Without everybody involved,

1167
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:11,398
never would have happened.

1168
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,732
I have some fond memories
of this place.

1169
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,639
Thowin' back brooze.

01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,607
Sometimes wish
I could come back.

1172
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,942

1180
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,245

1184
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:08,589
Excuse me girls.

1185
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,898
Don't slam the door on my face.

1186
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:22,571
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because I brought you these.

1187
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:28,810
You wanna come in?

1188

1193
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:47,885
- House mates.
- Right.

1194
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,163
I figured
that we should start fresh.

1195
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:56,032
