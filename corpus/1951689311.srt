00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,580
Peter was a courageous boy.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,260
But that dawn he could feel fear
stick to his skin like dew on leaves.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,220
The fog was thick enough,
to make him lose his way home.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,700
Then he began to hear strange noises
coming from the depths of the forest.

6
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,420
He noticed a presence...

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,100
Small shadows that seemed to giggle
as they followed in his footsteps.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,100
Who were they, grandpa?

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,780
Cruel, deformed forest dwellers,
party creatures, spiteful and impudent.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,940
They are the vengeful and evil goblins.
Little people of the night.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,540
What did they want with him?
What did Peter do to the goblins?

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,860
Thats the point: Goblins don't need to justify
their cruel acts, they're evil creatures.

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,780
But, let me go on, please!

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,860
Okay, i won't interrupt you anymore.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,140
To make a long story short:
Peter started to run

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,540
and run

17
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,420
and run...

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,380

19
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,780
Poor Peter remained on the ground
unconscious for a long time.

20
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,460
Finally when he opened his eyes,
he saw there in front of him,
just a few inches away from him...

21
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,380
A goblin???

22
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,220
She was a lovely girl with huge eyes,
the color of the sea.

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,860
She looked at him kindly.
Her expression full of love.

24
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,940
Peter immediately fell in love with her.

25
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,220
She caressed him, and offered him
something to eat and drink.

26
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,380
Strange concoction she offered him,
was delicious.

27
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,340
Peter ate and drank without
ever taking his eyes off her.

28
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,140
He was bewitched by that gaze.
And it was that look that deceived him.

29
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,060
I bet it was a goblin in disguise.

30
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,740
These evil creatures can transform
themselves into flesh and blood people,

31
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,100
whenever and however thay want.

32
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,100
You're making a mistake grandpa:
You said they can.

33
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,300
You should've said they could.
Or what kind of fairy tale is it?

34
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,580
They can. THEY CAN!

35
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,380
Goblins still exist.

36
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,300
Your grandpa Seth is telling you.

37
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:59,940
- And how did Peter end up?
- He began to feel ill, very ill.

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,900
He was sweating chlorophyl green.

39
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,500
- GREEN?
- That's right. The color of the goblins,
the color of sap.

40
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,660
Then she appeared to him,
and she really was horrible and mocking.

41
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,180
- Changed into what?
- Half man, half plant. The goblin's favourite food.

42
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,740
- Food? Don't tell me they ate him, grandpa!
- That's exactly what happened.

43
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,380
With the voracity that has no equal on earth.

44
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,460
What are you doing still up, Josh?

45
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,860
Grandpa Seth was telling me a sto...

46
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,980
Still telling the same story, Josh?

47
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,380
I know mummy, i told you it never happen again,
but you see it's not a dream for me.

48
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,380
I see him in front of me, and he's so real.

49
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,380
And he tells me stories just like before.

50
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,540
Grandpa Seth has been gone for more than
six months now. You were at the funeral
and i know it was very difficult for you.

51
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,860
It was also very difficult for your father,
for Holly, and for me, his daughter.

52
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:34,980
He was an amazing man.
Grandpa Seth has remained in all our hearts,
but you must banish him from your mind.

53
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,380
- Remember what the doctor said?
- Of course: Grandpa Seth is an invention
of my subconscious.

54
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,460
That's right.

55
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,740
- But he's so real that...
- That's enough! Try to go to sleep!

56
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,300
We're going on a vacation tomorrow.
A month in the country will do us all good.

57
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,660
Good night, dear!

58
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,540
Good night, dear!

59
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,700
- Mum!
- Yes?

60
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,700
Do goblins exist?

61
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
No, dear. They don't exist.
Now try to go to sleep!

62
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah John, that's Nilbog, right.
Spell it? Yeah: N I L B O G

63
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,780
Yeah. We'll be gone around a month.
That's right. Can you take care
of the business while we're gone?

64
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,580
Yeah, that's great.
Okay, see you John. Bye.

65
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,380
- Are the kids sleeping?
- No, they're more awake than we are.

66
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,740
They're probably excited about the trip.

67
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,140
- Do you know how many people live in Nilbog?
- No. How many?

68
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,220
26, including the Presents. Isn't that wonderful?

69
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,220
- Come on to bed.
- It's just like, we'll be living
like our ancestors did.

70
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,420
Yeah, we'll be peasants and farmers.
Just like people did a century ago.

71
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,740
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I'm worried about Joshua.
He's still seeing grandpa Seth.

72
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,340
- When i was a kid i had an imaginery playmate too.
- But it wasn't your dead grandfather.

73
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,660
It'll end. This trip will make
him forget about your father.

74
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,580
- Michael!
- Yeah?

75
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,980
- Who are the goblins?
- The goblins!?

76
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,420
What a jerk!

77
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,020
He pointed the light right at me.

78
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,100
Goblins don't exist.

79
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,420
Elliot, what kind of idiotic joke is this?

80
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,980
You scared the shit out of me.

81
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture.
I have to release my lowest instincts with a woman.

82
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,020
- Release your instincts in the bathroom.
- Are you nuts? You're trying to turn me into a homo?

83
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,780
Wouldn't be too hard.
If my father discovers you're here,
he'll cut off your little nuts and eat them.

84
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,980
- He can't stand you.
- And you?

85
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,100
I like you.

86
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,740
But my family doesn't like you.
They say you're good for nothing
and you spend way too much time with your friends.

87
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,180
Oh, but i swear i never see them.

88
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,660
Elliot, how long it's gonna take?
We're sick of waiting for ya.

89
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,740
Don't you want to come to Nino's with us, Holly?
Don't you want some pizza?

90
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,460
Man, these are cute. Hey!

91
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,140
- Do you see!?
- What's wrong with having friends?

92
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,700
Nothing, if you want to remain a virgin for a life.
You take them to bed with you too,
and i don't believe in group sex.

93
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,580
- Is that true that your family's
going on a vacation tomorrow?
- Yes.

94
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,460
- I'll come with you!?
- Okay, i tell my father that
you're coming with us tomorrow.

95
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,380
- Where are we going?
- Nilbog, a wonderful half-empty town.

96
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,860
It's an exchange.
A family from the country is coming to live here,
and we're going to live in their house.

97
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh Elliot, it will be wonderful.

98
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,620
You and me in the woods. This time
we'll be able to be together for sure.

99
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,340
- And my boys!?
- If you bring them with you,
i never wanna see you again.

100
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Ok. I'm going now, and i tell them.
I'll see you tomorrow morning!?

101
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,980
- At eight, on the dot.
- Okay.

102
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,340
- Elliot!
- Yeah?

103
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,180
- Alone?
- Of course. I'll see you tomorrow morning.

104
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,020
Finally.

105
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:33,380
- Please, don't do this, Holly.
- We could've waited another fifteen minutes.
I'm sure he would've come.

106
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,620
We left at 9:30 an hour and half after our schedule,
and we've never saw a sign of your bow.

107
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:48,740
Elliot's not my bow. He's my boyfriend, and he
told me last night that he loves me, and that
he wants to come on this trip with me and my family.

108
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,540
- Evidentally he prefered his friends to you.
- That's not true!

109
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,100
Yes it is. You should listen to reason!
Elliot is a good for nothing.

110
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,140
Now stop it both of you!
I have no intention of having
my vacation ruined just for this.

111
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,020
- Never liked that kid, i never did.
- I'm the one who has to like him, dad. Me alone.

112
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:17,060
Stop it please! Joshua, start singing!
C'mon sing that song i like so much!

113
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,940
- I don't feel like singing, mom.
- Just sing!

114
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:37,940
<i>Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.</i>

115
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,540
Where the hell is Nilbog?
It's not even marked on the map.

116
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,780
It's gotta be there somewhere.
Just look closer.

117
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,140
Here it is, but it's just a suspect.

118
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,300
- Are you sure it's full of beautiful girls, Elliot?
- Lots of them, free and unattached.

119
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,620
Yeah!

120
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,500
I don't feel good.

121
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,620
Stop the car, dad! I'm sick.

122
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,500
Stuffed yourself like a pig, Joshua.

123
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,420
I would love to see you get sick.
You ate too much.

124
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,980
Dad, stop the car.
Joshua's ready to be eaten.

125
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,660
- No, don't eat me!
- Joshua!

126
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,260
Was i dreaming?

127
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,340
- Who wants to eat you, little brother?
- Nobody.

128
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,900
Only a few miles away, Josh.

129
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,380
- Speaking of eating: Do you want some, Joshua?
- No, thanks.

130
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,060
<i>STOP THEM!</i>

131
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,060
- Stop the car, daddy! Stop!
- What's wrong, Josh?

132
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,820
- Do you have to throw up?
- Yes, i have to throw up.

133
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,020
- What are you doing here, grandpa?
- What are all of you doing here?
You have to make them go back.

134
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,260
- Why?
- You're getting yourselves into big trouble.

135
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,140
This is a bad place, little one.
It even gives me the creeps.

136
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,260
Can't you tell me more, grandpa?

137
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,300
What are you doing, Joshua?

138
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,900
So how about it?
Are you going to give me a ride or not?

139
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,980
Get in the car, Joshua! C'mon, hurry!

140
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,580
C'mon, get in!

141
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,420
Holly!

142
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,420
Holly, wait!

143
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,300
- Well, that was them. Right?
- Yeah, right. She just...

144
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,540
Why didn't Holly stop 'em?

145
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,820
- I don't think it was such a good idea
to come up here, guys.
- Just shut up. I'm the one in charge.

146
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,820
There's noone here.

147
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,220
It's normal. This is a farming community.
Remember: At this time of night,
everybody go to sleep.

148
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,300
- Where's the farm?
- It's over there.

149
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,540
Now remember: We're the farmer Waits.
We're country people.

150
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,740
- Dad!
- What Josh?

151
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,900
- I don't like this place. Can we go home?
- What?

152
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,660
Don't listen to him.
Lead the way, farmer Waits.

153
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,540
Okay.

154
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,900
Fresh air, country air.

155
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,860
Hello!

156
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,180
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, we had a small mishap.

157
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,020
- Here are the keys.
- Uhm, here are ours.

158
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,580
- Enjoy your stay in Nilbog.
- Enjoy our city too.

159
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:55,220
You'll enjoy our city. It might be a little noisy,
but our house has all the major conveniences.

160
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,220
- Yeah, it's got a microwave, a video,
and all the other appliances.
- Yeah.

161
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,660
A refrigerator, a bar.

162
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,940
<i>EAT BEFORE WE EAT YOU</i>

163
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,260
Joshua, you're coming?

164
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,180
Not bad.

165
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm hungry.

166
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,260
They probably left something behind,
I'd be willing to bet.

167
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,060
Come, take a look everyone!

168
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,420
Tipical country hospitality. Let's dig in!

169
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,620
- I'm so hungry.
- Here, have some of this!

170
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,380
Here, try this! It looks good.

171
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,500
- Grandpa!
- Don't let them eat, Joshua!
For the love of God, don't let them eat!

172
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,780
Aren't you hungry, Joshua?

173
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:41,460
Stop them, Joshua! You're the only one
that can do it. If they eat, they'll
come to the same end as Peter in the story.

174
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,740
But how can i stop them?

175
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,460
Okay. You have 30 seconds to
come up with some way to stop them.

176
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,220
I must do it.

177
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,180
I must do it. I must do it.

178
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,300
No daddy, please!

179
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,340
Don't hit him, Michael!
Please don't hit him.

180
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,780
Why not? It's what he deserves.
A big spanking for a little shit.

181
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,500
Joshua is not a little shit.
He's just very sensitive.

182
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,260
Argh, this smells.

183
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,060
Do you see this writing?

184
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,940
Do you know what it means?

185
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,820
Hospitality.

186
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,340
And you can't piss on hospitality.
I WON'T ALLOW IT!

187
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,500
- What are you going to do to me, daddy?
- Tightening my belt by one loop,
so i don't feel hunger pains.

188
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
And your sister and mother will have to do likewise.

189
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,340
Okay Joshua! You wanna get rough with me!?

190
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,500
You wanna show me that you don't like
the choice of this house for a vacation
by going on a hunger strike!?

191
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,780
Well, i accept the challange, but just remember:
When i was your age i really did suffer from hunger.
We'll see who gets through this.

192
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,300
But just remember: I've got more practice than you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

193
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:44,260
- I'm sick of this. Where are the single,
unattached, twenty girls, Elliot?
- Dont be a pain in the neck Arnold! We just got here.

194
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,060
I'm going outside for a breath of fresh air.

195
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,380
Hey, Arnold! If you find any twins, don't be greedy.

196
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,380
Hey!

197
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,820
Hey!

198
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,380
Ma'am! Please stop!

199
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,060
- Who are you?
- Who are you? Are you one of the monsters?

200
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,420
Well, i've been called a lot of things,
but not a monster.

201
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,420
- You're human?
- Very human. You wanna see?

202
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,580
- What's the matter? Are you sick?
- They made me eat that stuff. I'm dying.

203
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,300
They who? Who are you talking about?

204
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,220
There they are!

205
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,420
- Uhm, but what are they?
- Monsters.

206
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,060
What do you want from me?

207
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,060
Wait here! I'll take care of them.

208
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,340
Let me give you some advice, you dwarves.

209
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,740
Get out of here, or you're going
to be in a lot of trouble.

210
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,140
And remember...

211
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,900
Hey, did you guys hear that yell?

212
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,820
It's probably just Arnold,
deflowering a Nilbog virgin.

213
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,220
No, that wasn't a scream of a woman.
That was Arnold.

214
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,220
Well, it was probably a girl
from Nilbog deflowering Arnold.

215
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,660
Out of here! Wake!

216
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,620
Lets hide in this house!

217
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,780
What kind of a place is this?

218
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,900
This is my house.

219
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,500
Allow me to introduce myself.

220
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:07,340
I'm Creedence Leonore Gielgud
of ancient druid origins.

221
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,460
My ancestors came from Stonehenge.

222
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,220
Am i mistaken or is there something
wrong with the two of you?

223
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,100
We need a doctor, ma'am.
Please call the nearest hospital!

224
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:38,380
There is no hospital in Nilbog.
We are used to curing ourselves.

225
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:55,300
Here we are. This broth is miraculous.

226
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,340
It contains sap from the forest.

227
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,900
It is a concentration of all
of the vegetal properties of the Earth.

228
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:14,820
Drink of it, children, my poor children.

229
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,460
- What's wrong? What's wrong with her?
- Quit worrying about her. Drink your broth.

230
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,020
I can't... I can't move. Why?

231
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,900
Talk too much for me.

232
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,740
Oh my god. What's happening to her?
And why can't i move?
There must be a logical reason for all of this.

233
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,900
Shut up!

234
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,860
She's changing.

235
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:02,980
Purifying herself.
Now she's one with the vegetable world.

236
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,900
Now she is food for my children.

237
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,580
Make yourselves comfortable!

238
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,660
They're eating her.
And then they're going to eat me.

239
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,500
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!

240
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,100
I don't like this place. Not one bit.

241
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,460
Dear Elliot Cooper,
tomorrow morning will be your final judgement.

242
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,700
Either me, or your boys.
Take it or leave it!

243
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,620
The beautiful Holly Waits...

244
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,660
...or your lovely little boys.

245
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,900
Make a choice, Elliot.

246
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,860
Joshua! Joshua!

247
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,940
Mum! Dad! Mum!

248
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,740
- What is it? What's the matter? What's wrong?
- I saw him.

249
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,620
- Who did you see?
- Grandpa Seth.

250
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,380
See!? It wasn't me this time.

251
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:35,540
It was a reflection in the mirror. It was him.
Grandpa Seth was calling out to Joshua.

252
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,860
I'm tired of this.
Come with me, all of you.

253
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,340
- So where's that damn mirror?
- It's right... right there.

254
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,060
- Look! There's noone other than us in there.
- But he was there before.

255
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,780
It's gotta be your imagination or hallucination.

256
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,180
- Are you still smoking dope, Holly?
- I swore i won't, dad.

257
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,820
Look! I wanna get up early in the morning.
We're still farmers now. Right?

258
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,980
I'm not sleeping in this room.

259
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,260
- C'mon Holly, didn't you hear what your father said?
- I'm not sleeping here.

260
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,860
I'll sleep here.

261
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,500
- You would really do that for me?
- Sure. Why not? I'm not afraid.

262
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,980
- Night son.
- Night Josh. Thank you.
- Goodnight Josh. Now go to sleep.

263
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,500
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth are you here?

264
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:56,060
- What happened?
- You were in the wrong room.
Holly was sleeping there.

265
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,340
I still have to learn the layout of this house.

266
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,940
Well, i'm glad to see you, grandpa.
Did you see? I managed to keep them from eating.

267
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:13,340
Now you have to convince them to leave here.
This is an evil place.
It is the kingdom of the goblins.

268
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:22,500
- Why don't you tell my mummy and daddy these things?
- They don't listen to me.
Your mother has never taken my advice.

269
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,220
That's why she married that good for nothing.

270
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:36,460
Powers of evil are very strong here.
I must leave. But i'll be back, Joshua. I'll be back.

271
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,580
Grandpa, only you can do something. Only you.

272
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,340
Damn. There's no milk. There's no coffee.
And there's nothing.

273
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,540
- Guys, did anyone remember to bring supplies?
- We left in too much of a hurry, Drew.

274
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,860
- Go in to town to do the shopping now.
- Yeah, but i don't have any money.

275
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,820
- Just take from all our group fund.
- Okay.

276
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,020
Is breakfast ready, dear?

277
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:51,180
Geez, there's nothing in the whole house.
No eggs, no bacon. There's just a lot of milk,
but it's all like this.

278
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,780
It must be a week old.

279
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,820
Good morning mum. Good morning dad.

280
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,700
What's for breakfast?

281
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,820
- Nothing.
- What? I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
I've been fasting for two days.

282
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,100
- No problem. Josh and I will run in town
to general store. Right, Josh?
- Okay.

283
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,020
We won't be gone long.

284
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,660
- Hello, son.
- Hi.

285
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,700
- Are you in training?
- No, just going shopping.

286
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,100
- Hop in then. You save your breath that way.
- Okay. Thanks.

287
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,340
- I'm sheriff Gene Freak.
- Well, nice to meet you, sheriff.

288
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,980
- Are you just passing through Nilbog?
- Well, i'm on vacation with some friends.
We parked our camper on the road.

289
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,780
- Are you hungry?
- Well, a little bit. Yeah.

290
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,700
Good.

291
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm sure you'll all enjoy Nilbog.
We're hospitable people.
Especially to strangers.

292
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
Now here's the general store.

293
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:21,260
- And sheriff, where do the girls
from around here go at night?
- Haha, the girls...

294
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,380
Can i help you?

295
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,220
- Coffee!?
- There's no coffee here in Nilbog.
It's the devil's drink.

296
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,540
- Eggs?
- Eeeeeew.

297
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,900
- Bacon?
- Are you crazy, boy? We're vegetarians
here in Nilbog. Didn't you know that?

298
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,740
Here's some Nilbog milk.

299
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,860
Special milk, high in vitamin content.
Here, it's free.

300
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,340
- Free?
- Of course it's free.
We love tourists here in Nilbog.

301
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:46,900
- Try some, boy! And have some of
your friends drink some also.
- Thank you.

302
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,340
- Do you feel allright?
- Yeah.

303
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,860
- Hey, you.
- Yeah?

304
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,780
Your friend has a message for you.

305
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,900
- Who? Arnold?
- Yeah, that's him.

306
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,820
He said to meet him in the house
that looks like an old church.

307
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,500
Okay.

308
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,820
You can go through the woods.
It's only about a mile away.

309
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,260
Good morning my little flower.

310
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,540
Don't be too worried about the closed mouth.

311
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,940
You didn't have anything to say anyway. Right?

312
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,900
With this you'll become strong and beautiful.

313
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,020
Now i'm going to welcome our new neighbours.

314
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:29,220
I have just prepared this pudding with wild nettles

315
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:41,100
and a few organic additives to make it
delicious and purify the intestines.

316
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,020
See you later, my little flower.

317
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,980
<i>Closed. Will re-open in 20 minutes.
After the sermon.</i>

318
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,220
We have to wait and be patient.

319
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,460
<i>Vegetable cookbook</i>

320
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,820
Grendpa! Grendpa Seth! Are you there?

321
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,260
NILBOG. It's GOBLIN spelled backwards.

322
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,380
This is their kingdom.

323
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:03,980
Good morning. I am your neighbour.
I'm Creedence Leonore Gielgud.

324
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,860
Good morning.

325
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,460
Mum, i'm going for a walk.

326
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,860
- Hello beautiful.
- Hi.

327
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,980
She is very appetizing.

328
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,340
- Appetizing?
- Provocative.

329
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:27,740
I thought you might enjoy one of my ancient recipes.

330
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,260
It's a traditional dish in these parts.

331
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,540
Oh but you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble.

332
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,980
No trouble...

333
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,340
...really.

334
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,820
They're still here.

335
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,140
...symbol of original sin,

336
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,300
which is consumed, and caused the falling human race,

337
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,420
which is so dear to us.

338
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:46,980
FLESH! And by flesh i mean
all that stinking, disgusting meat.

339
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:59,500
Hamburgers, steaks, sausages,
and hotdogs sold by the side of the road.

340
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,300
The stink of smoked carcasses.

341
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,940
The humans nurse themselves with these.

342
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:19,260
Violating their own bodies,
infecting themselves.

343
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:29,220
Creating incurable elements, smelly bladders.
Nest of infection.

344
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,640
Vicious, stinky excrement.

345
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,980
Elliot! Elliot!

346
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,020
Holly, what a surprise.

347
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,420
Choose Elliot!
Either me or your friends!?

348
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,180
I don't understand.

349
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,180
Do you understand now?

350
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,180
- Is it ready?
- Here it is. Nice and creamy.

351
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,900
This is a wonderful cup of
Nilbog icecream for a little child.

352
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:42,740
You're gonna stuff yourself with it, don't you?
Kids with a sweet tooth like yours love icecream.

353
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,780
Help, grandpa Seth! HELP!

354
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:54,900
Hmmm, open your mouth my little friend.
Please, open it!

355
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,740
I won't. I don't want to.

356
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:07,100
Hmmm, open your mouth my little friend.
Please, open it!

357
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,380
No, I won't.

358
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,300
I don't want to.

359
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,900
Stop! What are you doing to my son?

360
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,180
We were giving him some icecream.

361
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,820
Daddy, they're goblins, monsterous beeings.

362
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,780
- What?
- They were giving me icecream,
so they can eat me later.

363
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,220
An active imagination.
A bit morbid, isn't he?

364
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:49,580
I mean look at them. They all have
a molded shape of a cloverleaf.
And Nilbog, it's goblin spelled backwards.

365
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,220
I'm telling you daddy, they're monsters.

366
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:59,660
Mr and Mrs Presents, what are you doing here?
I thought you supposed to be in my house.

367
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,260
We had car trouble.
We'll be leaving this evening.

368
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,700
Okay.

369
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,940
It was nice meeting all of you.
My son and i must be leaving now.

370
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,740
We need time for some things to happen.
We must have patience until tonight.

371
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,100
Christ!

372
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,580
- What is it?
- Your sister Holly's with
that playboy son of a Coopers.

373
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,180
Look, they're my friends. Allright?

374
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,860
Hey, wait, wait! Stop it!

375
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,060
Oh no!

376
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,940
- So kids, how is life?
- Listen, Mr Waits.

377
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,780
I don't want to have anything to do with you.
I don't speak to people who arrive
late and upset their girlfriends.

378
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,220
You give me a bad impression.

379
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,420
- C'mon, dad!
- We'll get in the car and talk, Holly. Okay?

380
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,660
- Listen Mr Waits! We need to have a serious talk.
- If you want to have a serious talk,
you have to forget about your friends

381
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,900
and come to our house.
Otherwise you can forget about Holly.

382
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,420
Allright. I'm coming.

383
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,500
- Hey, wait a minute, Elliot.
You're gonna leave me here alone?
- Yes.

384
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,060
- But what do i tell to Drew and Arnold?
- Tell them whatever you want.

385
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,900
- What am i gonna do?
- Take the camper. Do what you want.

386
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,780
And what about the beautiful liberated girls?

387
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,820
Is anyone here?

388
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,420
I feel so dizzy.

389
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,660
Drew! Over here!

390
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,300
Arnold?

391
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,620
Is that you?

392
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,980
Arnold, what happened?

393
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,180
What?

394
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,940
- Get me out of here, Drew. Just get me out of here.
- Okay, don't fret.

395
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,140
Hurry, before the crazy lady gets back.

396
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,660
- Grab the pot, and drag me out. Quick!
- I'll try.

397
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,020
Hurry!

398
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,980
- What's wrong? Why did you stop?
- I don't feel so good.

399
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:54,860
You gotta do it, man. Grab hold of the pot,
and pull with all of your strength.
We can get out of this nightmare. Hurry!

400
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,860
Hello!

401
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,820
Oh no.

402
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,420
You've been thinking of leaving us, little flower?

403
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,340
No, please, ma'am!

404
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,140
You will be punished for this.

405
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,580
No! Please, ma'am, i beg you!

406
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,500
What're you gonna do?
What're you gonna do to me with that?

407
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,060
I'm going to make a large brashness for your friend.

408
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,300
But this won't hurt you.

409
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,420
You'll just feel a little tickle, little flower.

410
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,740
What's going on here?

411
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,940
Oh, Michael!

412
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,260
Look, what a surprise they have prepared for us.

413
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,020
Finally! I'm so hungry.

414
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:17,260
- What are you doing here, Elliot?
- Mum, Elliot's part of the family now.

415
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,940
Oh, Elliot.

416
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:27,260
What a plesure to see you again, Mr Waits.
We wanted to make up with this
misunderstandment we got a little while ago.

417
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:33,660
Look! All the people of Nilbog have
decided to give you a party.
We even have a little food.

418
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,140
A little food? They prepared a whole feast.

419
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,780
<i>EAT UP!!</i>

420
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:49,820
Dance my children! Dance and eat! EAT!

421
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:58,100
No, don't eat that stuff. They're monsters.
They're all monsters. If you eat this stuff,
they'll kill us. They're goblins.

422
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,700
Joshua, I've had enough. I'm sick of this.
I want you to go to your room immediately.

423
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,420
Children's fancies. They will pass.

424
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,340
Of course.

425
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,980
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Grandpa!

426
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,900
<i>ENJOY</i>

427
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,540
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Answer me!

428
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,180
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Come quick!

429
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,020
Grandpa Seth!

430
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,020
Help, grandpa Seth! Heeelp!

431
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,140
Grandpa!

432
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,380
- We must move quickly to put out the fire.
- What fire?

433
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,580
Guess!

434
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,300
That is enough.

435
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:59,020
We go around the house. When the time comes,
you light the wig and throw the bottle.

436
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,580
I'll create some confusion with this.

437
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,100
Hurry! Let's put some fuel on the fire.

438
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,860
Cut that out, kid!
You'll never be able to stop us.

439
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:54,780
And as for you old man:
Go back to your kingdom of shadows.

440
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,820
I order you...

441
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,260
...with the secret power of the magic stone:

442
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,660
Go back to hell!

443
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,260
Grandpa!

444
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,500
Grandpa!

445
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,620
Grandpa! Grandpa!

446
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,420
Joshua!

447
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,060
You'll have to do it yourself.

448
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,820
Are you really in hell?

449
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,740
No.

450
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:45,100
But I know a trick, that a friend
of mine who was there, taught me!

451
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,780
What happened?

452
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,700
Grandpa!

453
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,820
Oh my god! What is this?

454
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:57,300
He was one of us, and you killed him.
Now it's your turn.

455
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,620
Joshua!

456
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:53,900
Quick! In the house!

457
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:03,140
Oh lord of the magic rock Stonehenge!

458
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,780
Come and protect your children!

459
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,260
Come, and give us strength!

460
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:31,060
Give me all my old powers,
oh lord of the magic rock.

461
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:35,620
There are sandwiches for tonight in here.
It'll go easier if you eat them.

462
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:43,380
You'll make our work easier.
Otherwise, we'll be forced to kill you violently.

463
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:54,900
It would be a shame. The blood would
mix with the meat, and we'd have to put
them in vinegar for the whole night.

464
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,620
- Oh dear god! What can we do?
- We don't even have enough
weapons to defend ourselves.

465
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:15,140
- Do something, Elliot, please!
- I don't know what to do.

466
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:22,340
- We need grandpa Seth here.
- Joshua, grandpa Seth is dead.

467
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:26,220
I know he's dead, but until now
he's been the one helping us.

468
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,380
But how are we get him to come?
By holding a seance maybe?

469
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,060
You're a genius, big sister.

470
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:51,980
What the hell's wrong with this thing?

471
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:21,980
Do you like it?
Shall we eat it together?

472
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,940
What kind of show is this?

473
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,260
I'm not a programme.

474
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:37,180
I'm real. Come out, and you'll see.

475
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:28,900
- Won't you invite me in?
- Yeah. Of course.

476
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,500
How do you like it?

477
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,900
What's the matter? Aren't you hungry?

478
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,500
Actually, i like popcorn.

479
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:16,020
Well, no problem.
All we have to do is heat it up.

480
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,420
Nothing's happening.

481
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,180
Raise your hands!

482
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,140
Concentrate harder!

483
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,180
Grandpa Seth, come to us!

484
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,380
Let's show them we're still here.

485
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,900
Don't get distracted.

486
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,900
Concentrate harder!

487
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,540
Grandpa Seth, please come!

488
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:28,660
I don't like this.
Why don't they show any sign of life?

489
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,220
Grandpa, please come and help us!

490
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,100
Joshua! Joshua!

491
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,940
Dad!?

492
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,380
That's not possible.

493
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,580
I knew you wouldn't leave us, grandpa.

494
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,260
- That's the voice of your grandpa?
- Yes.

495
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:35,260
You have only ten minutes.
When that clock starts striking six,
i'll disappear. And now it is forever.

496
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:42,260
Together we can destroy the magic stone,
that gives the goblins their power.

497
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:49,460
- Concentrate, Joshua! Concentrate!
- Yes, grandpa.

498
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,580
Joshua!

499
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,660
Joshua!? Joshua!

500
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,660
Quick! Upstairs.

501
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,740
Michael!

502
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:20,140
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth, are you here?

503
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,940
Go away, monster!

504
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,180
Let's run!

505
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,100
Grandpa, where have you been?

506
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:48,740
Take this! Keep it!
You can only take out the contents,
when you really need it.

507
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:53,300
- Do you understand?
- I understand. And now?

508
01:18:54,820 --> 01:19:02,140
Here it is. The Stonehenge magic stone.
The goblins' magic power.

509
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:15,820
- What do we have to do, grandpa?
- Touch it! Only touch it!

510
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,500
Will it work?

511
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,500
I hope so.

512
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,940
Please, let's talk!
We're all humans here.

513
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:43,580
No more. No more popcorn.

514
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:14,180
Our queen is calling us.

515
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,660
Joshua's alone right now. Let's go!

516
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:34,820
- Grandpa! Nothing's happening.
- Something has happened now, Joshua!

517
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,780
- I'm leaving.
- No grandpa, not now.

518
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,260
Joshua, I have to do this once again.

519
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:52,100
Remember: It's only the power of
goodness that can defeat the goblins.

520
01:21:55,580 --> 01:22:02,140
- Goodbye forever.
- Goodbye, grandpa. Goodbye.

521
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:15,900
What were you going to do, little one?

522
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:01,860
Now, we're going to feed you, Joshua.

523
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:08,060
You've been fasting for two days.

524
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:14,620
You're hungry, right?

525
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:18,100
A double decker bologna sandwich.

526
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,300
Don't do it!

527
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:25,260
Think about the fuds in your blood.

528
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,740
Think about the cholesterol.

529
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:33,020
Think about the toxins.

530
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:38,740
No! No!

531
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,500
Joshua!

532
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,580
Grandpa Seth's voice brought us here.

533
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,900
Quick! Help me! Put your hands
on the stone and concentrate.

534
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,860
- What?
- Don't you see? Only the power of
goodness can destroy these monsters.

535
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,980
Put your hands on the stone!

536
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,780
Concentrate!

537
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,700
Concentrate more!

538
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,940
Concentrate!

539
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,460
I have to pass by the office.

540
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:55,980
- I need to go home... for a while.
- I'll come with you.

541
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,060
Joshua and I will wait for you at home.

542
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,300
Want some fruit, Joshua?
The fruit is still very good.

543
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,980
I don't want to eat for the next twenty years.

544
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,580
Uhm, it's delicious.

545
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:29,060
- I think i'm going to my room to take a nap.
- Good idea. I think i'll take a shower first.

546
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:05,020
I don't know how to thank you, grandpa.
I hope you're okay up there.

547
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,420
Mum?

548
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:29,500
<i>Yummy! Mom is so good</i>

549
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:31,860
Mummy!

550
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,820
Mummy!

551
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:11,220
They are eating my mom.

552
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:45,460
Do you want some, Joshua?

553
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:56,900
