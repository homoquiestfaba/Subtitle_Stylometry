1
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,200
l never could start
one those fires.

2
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Dad, are you gonna have
chicken or meat?

3
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,100
Chicken's fine.

4
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
This is a brilliant article.
Norman!

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,700
-You read Ken's article on China?
-No, l haven't.

6
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,600
Terrific article.

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
And where is Ken?

8
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,800
He's in the house
watching the Yankee game.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Your husband comes for a day
in the country.

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,300
And heads straight
forthe TV set.

11
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,100
Ken, come on honey!

12
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,700
How many chicken?
How many hamburgers?

13
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,000
Two more outs. Three minutes.

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Everybody's dying for a libation.

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,900
Make some of your famous
Stoli martinis.

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,400
Janet, when are you going
to have a child?

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,500
You've let your sister have a
big head start.

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Let Leslie practice viola 6 hours
a day. lt's not so easy.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
Leave her alone.

20
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
l came in to make drinks
for everybody.

21
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,600
-What are you doing? Want a drink?
-Sure.

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,700
l was.

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
This is nuts!

24
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,700
We gotta get out of here.

25
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,000
What? No, we'll get caught.

26
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,600
l see them by the lake.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,700
They're deep in conversation.

28
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Wait! There's Janet!

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
No. lt's okay.

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,500
You can't scare me like that.

31
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,000
l grind my teeth. Just don't
scare me like that.

32
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Just a false alarm.

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,800
Listen, try not to actually chew.

34
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Wouldn't it be great
to be off alone.

35
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
Just relaxed. You and me.

36
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
lt'd be so great.

37
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,700
Let's hang in. You never know.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
Come on, open wide.

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Turn the Yankee game off and
come out here now!

40
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,400
l will. Just one minute.
lt's almost over.

41
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
l'm done.

42
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,400
-Come any time you want.
-Can l?

43
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,600
l'm done!

44
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
l'm ready!

45
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,900
Leslie, is that you?

46
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,900
Can you lead me
down to the lake?

47
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,500
Just a minute, Grandma.

48
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
l'm making some martinis.

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
-Sure, dear.
-l want to finish.

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Ken? ls that you?

51
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Finish what?

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
Hello!

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
-Come, Ken.
-Come?

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,500
Come, lead me to the lake.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Ever since l lost my second eye...

56
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
l feel so frail.

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't have to moan.
lt's not that terrible.

58
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,900
Ken is hurrying, Grandma.

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Would you do the olives?
Could you do them quickly?

60
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
You can use onions, too.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,500
l prefer onions,
don't you, Ken?

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,500
Yes! Yes! Yes!

63
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,800
Boy, you must really
love onions!

64
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
-Lucy?
-You schmuck! You bastard!

65
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,500
l'd like to cut your head off.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
You're upset, right?

67
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,300
You knew what'd happen!

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,700
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,200
Don't answer me, prick!

70
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,100
You knew! You just didn't
give a shit!

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
Take your coat off.

72
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,600
How could you write that book?

73
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,100
Are you so selfish...

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,700
you don't give a shit
who you destroy?

75
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,000
-l can tell you're angry.
-You told our whole story!

76
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,200
You gave me away to my sister!

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Marvin's left me. He's gone.

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,500
lt was loosely based on us.

79
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,100
Don't bullshit me, motherfucker!

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,200
Do you think you're talking...

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,500
to one ofthose retarded
talk show hosts?

82
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,300
l lived through it with you.
l know how loosely based it is.

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
What, are you telling me your
blind grandmother...

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,900
caught us fucking?

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Never!

86
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,900
Of course, you made a few
stupid exaggerations.

87
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,400
or, as the critics say:
"inspired comic flights".

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,300
But Jane recognized it.
You'd have to be sub-mental not to.

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
And Marvin was crushed!

90
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,000
Jane has suspected us for so long.

91
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,600
l know! And l denied it!

92
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,200
And now, you've gone...

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,900
and confirmed it all for her!

94
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,300
Big fucking deal!
You made Leslie shorter!

95
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Big fucking deal!

96
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,700
But it's all here!

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,800
The schmuck country doctor,
the violinist...

98
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,100
her sister in Connecticut
cheating with her husband.

99
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,400
The picture window, for Chrissake!

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Cruel observations about Marvin...

101
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,900
and his barbecue and chef's hat.

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,700
And of course, Jane,
or as you so pathetically...

103
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,300
disguise her...

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Janet.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Here it is:

106
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
"lt was not just that Leslie
was numbed...

107
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,400
with the spate of leaden
perceptions...

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,700
that passed for wit from Marvin.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,500
Nor was the image
she shared with Ken...

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
of Marvin's flaccid
microscopic member...

111
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,100
jiggling up and down
as he tiptoed naked...

112
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,500
across the icy floor
oftheir home...

113
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
to close the storm windows.

114
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
lt was that she
had never loved him...

115
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,100
but she wanted children to retaliate
against her sister...

116
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,900
who was not maternal, and whose
every inch, Leslie felt...

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,900
was occupied by gluttonous
self-love.

118
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,800
Ken fondled Leslie's large breasts,
mounting her from the rear."

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Big fucking deal!

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,100
-You gave her large breasts!
-Leslie...

121
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,300
Lucy!

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,300
l'm Lucy, motherfucker!

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Not Leslie!

124
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,700
Except of course,
l am Leslie...

125
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,500
because you didn't disguise it!
You didn't give a fuck!

126
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,100
You didn't care enough
to disguise it!

127
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,100
Please!

128
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,800
You pulled out two years ago.
You broke my fucking heart.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,300
You left yourwife and me...

130
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
for some little cooze!

131
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,500
Me and Janet!

132
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,300
Jane. Janet is the character
in the book.

133
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,700
Now...

134
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,600
two years later...

135
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
your latest magnum opus...

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
emerges from this sewer of
an apartment...

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,500
where you take our suffering
and turn it into gold...

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,100
literary gold!

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Everyone's misery,
you even cause misery...

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
and use your alchemy...

141
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
to turn it into gold, like
some fucking black magician!

142
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,100
l'm the one who
wound up in Bellevue.

143
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,400
You deserve it and worse.

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,500
You ruined my life!
l'll blow my brains out!

145
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,800
What's wrong with you?

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
ln front of you...

147
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,600
because you caused it.
My brains on your carpet!

148
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
You're unstable!

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
Will you relax?

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
That's why l turn you on.
Jane's crazy sister.

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,600
You're not going to kill yourself.

152
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,500
No. you're not,
because it's not in you.

153
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,100
You're never were
the dramatic type.

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,100
Jane is the dramatic sister.
Jane is the solo violinist.

155
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,000
Relax, for Christ's sake.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,100
You're right.

157
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,700
l don't have the nerve
to kill myself.

158
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,300
l knew it as l came over here...

159
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,300
l said no.

160
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,700
Not me.

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,900
Better to kill him.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Pardon me?

163
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,200
Kill the black magician.

164
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,400
So he can't spin any more
gold out of human misery.

165
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
What's wrong with you?

166
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,800
Shut up!

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,100
-Put it down.
-You're so fucking verbal.

168
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,800
You talked me into giving you..

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
a blowjob at
my father's funeral!

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
You stop right there!

171
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't pull the trigger!

172
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,700
lf it makes you happy, my life's
been going badly.

173
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,500
l've been miserable. My girl
left me for a friend of mine.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
lnsomnia. l've got herpes.

175
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,700
l squandered all l have
on shrinks...

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
and lawyers and whores.

177
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,900
Fatigue syndrome.

178
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
l won't stand up here on this
fucking roof...

179
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,700
with aworld-class meshugana
cunt and beg for my life...

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
lf you want, shoot me!
You interrupted me...

181
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,200
-Whose life were you exploiting today?
-You'll be happy.

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
lt was re-writing.

183
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
An autobiographical thing from
when l was first married.

184
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,600
Harvey Stern married too young...

185
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,500
to escape his parent's apartment,
arent-controlled cornucopia...

186
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
of guilt, and
sou-deadening criticism.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,900
By day, he labored in a shoe store.

188
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,500
By night, he glowed intensely over
his Remington portable.

189
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Are you coming to bed?

190
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,300
l'm in the middle of a sentence.

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,100
-l lost my thread.
-l feel rejected.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,300
We never sleep together anymore.

193
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,500
l don't knowwhat it is.
l'm just not attracted to her.

194
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
-What does she do to put you off?
-lt's my fault, too.

195
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,100
l lie, telling her
l'm too wrapped up in work...

196
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,000
when l'm actually hyper-sexually
aroused. Just not for her.

197
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,500
Who for?

198
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Anyone else.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
Shehas a sister.
l'm dying to fuckher.

200
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,400
A doll, thicklips.

201
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Her friend Jennifer?.
l dream of her.

202
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,700
l never cared about African
history but she's spellbinding.

203
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,200
The truth is,
l never see a woman..

204
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,300
that l don´t wonder
what she's like in bed.

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
l met a great hooker!

206
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
A hooker?

207
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,200
Beautiful. From China.

208
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,700
Unbelievable body.

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Schooled by tradition
in the art of pleasing men.

210
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,200
Fifty clams.

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
lsn't that cheating on your wife?

212
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
No. lt's not cheating.
She's a hooker.

213
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
lt's not like a love affair.

214
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,500
You don't feel for a professional
like you do for yourwife.

215
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,900
She comes over,
rubs on her oils...

216
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,000
Oils?

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,200
lnto the sack.
She takes you to the moon.

218
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,000
Lay half a C-note on her
she's history.

219
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Where would you do it?

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,900
l couldn't have her
at my apartment.

221
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,400
You get a hotel room. lt's what
l do when the wife's home.

222
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,800
l don't have the dough.
Fifty's a lot in itself.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,300
Maybe a friend'll let you use
his place.

224
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,200
You're always bitching about
your sex life.

225
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,900
l'm trying to help.

226
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,200
l tell her you
gave me the number?

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Not my name!
Don't use your real name.

228
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,800
Of course. Not the real name.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,400
You borrow a friend's apartment,
you use his name.

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,500
That way it'll be on the bell.

231
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,600
Good fortune smiled on Harvey.

232
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
One of his best friends,
Mendel Birnbaum, was hit by a car,

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,500
and hovered between life and death
at New York Hospital...

234
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,600
freeing up a great bachelor
apartment...

235
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,300
for Harvey's tryst.

236
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Donning the otherman's robe...

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Harvey became
the swinger Mendel Birnbaum...

238
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,000
and waited...

239
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,900
his Oriental passport to paradise.

240
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,400
You must be Mendel Birnbaum.

241
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,200
Did you enjoy it?

242
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,300
-Are you kidding? Be right back.
-Where you going?

243
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
l'm going to check my pants
for another 50.

244
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,500
l'd like to go again.

245
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,400
Yes?

246
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
-Mendel Birnbaum?
-Yes.

247
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Open.

248
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,000
Who is it?

249
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,200
Who are you?

250
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,900
l've come for you.

251
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,900
-What are you talking about?
-l'm Death...

252
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,600
and your name is on my list.

253
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,000
No!

254
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Wait a minute.
You've made a mistake.

255
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
You don't have a minute.

256
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,800
l'm not Mendel...

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't give me that bullshit!

258
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
Look at your monogram.

259
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Mendel?

260
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,100
Who are you talking to?

261
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
Don't call me Mendel.

262
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,900
-Please. l'm just using his pad.
-Right!

263
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
They always have an excuse.

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,700
Let's go!

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Move it, you little putz!

266
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,800
l'm on the roof.
She's pointing a gun at me...

267
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,300
we're out in the cold
and l'm panicked.

268
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
l tell her a story l wrote
when l was younger...

269
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,600
and she found it funny,
thank God.

270
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,900
She laughed and relaxed and
she puts the gun down.

271
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,800
So your writing saved your life.

272
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,000
lt's amazing to me, you know?

273
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,000
The interesting thing apart
from the obvious sexual guilt...

274
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
that l had when
l was young in the story...

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,500
is that nothing's changed.

276
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,300
lt's years later.

277
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
l had a shrink then and now...

278
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,300
l'm six shrinks later...

279
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,600
l'm three wives down the line.

280
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
And l still can't get
my love life in order.

281
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
l still love whores.

282
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,900
lt's ideal. You pay them, and
they come to the house...

283
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
and you don't have to discuss
Proust or films or...

284
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
l don't knowwhat's
happening to me.

285
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,500
l just have not grown up
and l feel...

286
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
l see other guys my age.

287
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
l think of fucking
every woman l meet.

288
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,900
l meet a woman in the bank...

289
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,400
or on the bus...

290
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,400
l think: What's she look like naked?
Can l fuck her?

291
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
This is crazy.

292
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,500
l see guys l know that
are lawyers and doctors...

293
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,300
with families and houses.

294
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,900
They're not so...

295
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,800
Does the U.S. President want
to fuck every woman he meets?

296
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,100
Bad example.

297
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
l don't know.

298
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Take Raoul Wallenberg...

299
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Did he want to bang every
waitress in Europe?

300
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Probably not.

301
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Tell me about
your honoring ceremony.

302
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,800
That's bullshit.

303
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
The same school that
threw me out years ago...

304
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,600
now wants to honor me.

305
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,500
Why'd they throw you out?

306
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,500
Because l was not
interested in college.

307
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
l wanted to be a writer.
Writing was all l cared about.

308
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,100
l did not care about
the real world.

309
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,200
l cared only about
the world of fiction.

310
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,600
Plus l tried to give...

311
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,100
the dean's wife and enema.
They didn't like that.

312
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,300
The sad thing is...

313
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
l've gotta drive way
upstate to be honored...

314
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,900
and l have to go alone.
l got nobody to go with...

315
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,400
What about bringing
your son with you?

316
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,500
l can't. lt's not
my visiting time.

317
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Joan is completely
inflexible, so...

318
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,300
She won't trade dates with you?

319
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
l can't even get her
on the phone.

320
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
She hates me and...

321
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,300
for the first time in my life
l have writer's block.

322
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Now this, to me, is unheard of.

323
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,600
l start these short stories
and l can't finish them.

324
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
l can't get into my novel...

325
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,400
because l took an advance.

326
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
l don't know.

327
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,900
l find l'm taking more pills
and medicine and...

328
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,500
You remind me of that story
you were working on...

329
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,100
two months ago...

330
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,500
"The Actor"...

331
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,300
Something's wrong with this lens.

332
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
This one, too? l changed lenses!

333
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,100
What do you mean?
Focus is off!

334
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,500
-l don't know why it's a problem.
-The center's out of focus.

335
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,000
l checked all the lenses,
they can't be soft.

336
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,500
Let's move it. lt's late.

337
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,900
l'm tryin' to shoot Mel
and he's soft.

338
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,900
What?

339
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,000
-Where do you rent these lenses?
-The lenses are fine!

340
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,000
-Mel's out of focus!
-That's what l said.

341
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,300
Not the lens.
l mean Mel himself.

342
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,700
Let me see!
Get the hell out.

343
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,100
You're right. Mel's out of focus.

344
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,500
What are you saying?

345
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
l said the actor's out of focus.

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,200
How can this be?

347
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,000
ls something wrong?

348
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,500
Mel, come here.

349
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,900
l don't know how to say this...

350
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
but you're soft.

351
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,000
l've gained some weight.

352
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
lt's not that. You're soft.

353
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
You're out of focus.

354
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
l don't knowwhy.
ls there anything we can do?

355
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,800
l can't adjust forthis.

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Look at yourself.

357
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
You sure you're okay?

358
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,900
lt's fuzzy.

359
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
All right, look...

360
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,700
Mel's out of focus.

361
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,200
You're not in focus.

362
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Nothing to do.

363
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,100
lt's 4 o'clock, anyway.
Why don't we just wrap?

364
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,700
We'll wrap and
we'll see what happens

365
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Now look. l want you
to go home.

366
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And l want you to rest.

367
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
And see if you can
sharpen up.

368
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Grace, l'm home.

369
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,800
Hi, honey.

370
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
What's the matter?
You look strange.

371
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,100
l'm out of focus.

372
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
Yeah...

373
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,700
You are. Just a little bit.
You are.

374
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
And you look pale.

375
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,100
Daddy, you're all blurry!

376
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
Maybe you should lie down.

377
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
-l'll bring tea and toast?
-Daddy's out of focus!

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,300
Daddy doesn't need that, okay?

379
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Come on now, you be nice.

380
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,000
What happened at work today?

381
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
First they thought
it was the camera...

382
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Reuben! Stop it!

383
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,000
They thought it was the camera...
but it was me!

384
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
-Really?
-They send me home.

385
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,200
-lt's humiliating.
-You eat anything strange? Shellfish?

386
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,700
No. This is not
an allergic reaction.

387
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,700
You know what?

388
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,100
l just need to get a good
night's sleep.

389
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,300
-l'm sure that's all it is.
-What happened to you?

390
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,800
Get a good night's sleep.
Turn in early...

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,700
and tomorrow you'll be fine.

392
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,200
But the following morning
things did not improve.

393
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
ln fact, the situation was worse.

394
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,100
Mel was more out of focus
than ever.

395
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
l gotta get to the doctor.

396
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,300
Never seen anything like this.

397
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Nothing's wrong with you,
except you're out of focus.

398
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
What's the matter?

399
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,100
lt's from looking at Mel.
l'm a little seasick.

400
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,700
That's why l want everyone
to try these.

401
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,900
-l don't wear glasses.
-Wait, let's see.

402
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
l don't want glasses.

403
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,700
-Put 'em on so you can see me.
-Better!

404
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,800
-l look stupid with these on.
-Come on. Put 'em on.

405
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,800
-Daddy'll be much sharper.
-Want to see Daddy?

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Put those on and
we won't get headaches.

407
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Despite the fact children
don't want to wear glasses...

408
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,200
they're forced to.

409
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
You expect the world to adjust...

410
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,300
to the distortion
you've become.

411
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,900
l don't expect anything.

412
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
l'm going through something.

413
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,800
Forthe first time in my life
l can't seem to write.

414
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
lt's not coming.
And for me...

415
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,500
all l have in life
is my imagination.

416
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,900
Ourtime is up.

417
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
Have fun at the honoring ceremony.

418
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,800
lt'd be good if you took
your son with you.

419
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,100
Joan!

420
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
-You never return calls.
-Leave me alone!

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
-How do l reach you?
-Shall l call the police?

422
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
l've got a question.

423
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,700
-Will you stop?
-No. l won't listen.

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Tomorrow they honor me at my old
school. l want to take Hilly.

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,500
-He has school tomorrow.
-Trade a visitation day.

426
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
No! l have plans with him.

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
lt'd be good for him
to see me honored.

428
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,800
l don't want him to.
l don't want him to see you ever!

429
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,700
He'll have a day in the country.
Will you stop?

430
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,000
A day in the country.
What is so bad?

431
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
He is 9 years old.

432
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,100
Where does he learn phrases like
"banging beaver" and " fuck God"?

433
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
What are you saying?
From me?

434
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,500
Do l look like an imbecile?

435
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,200
l know your conversations with him...

436
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
and l heard about "Open School Week".

437
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,200
Beth Kramer was appalled.

438
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,100
Dad?

439
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,900
Why doesn't my penis
look like yours?

440
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
Why doesn't your penis
look like mine?

441
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,700
Because your mother and l...

442
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,700
never had you circumcised.

443
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,900
When l was your age, you know
what kids used to do?

444
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,800
They used to name their penises.

445
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
l'm going to name mine Dillinger.

446
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,600
Dillinger is perfect!
Dillinger is great!

447
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,600
Hilly, you're inspired.
A genius.

448
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,000
Dillingerwas a genius
in his chosen profession...

449
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,500
like Willy Sutton.

450
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,800
Remember how we
discussed Freud once?

451
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Freud said the two most important
things in life...

452
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,300
are the work that you chose
and sex.

453
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Those two things.

454
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Women...

455
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,200
are God.

456
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
God's awoman?

457
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,000
No. l'm not saying that.

458
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,700
We don't know ifthere's
a God...

459
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,600
but there are women.

460
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,700
Not in some imaginary heaven,
but right here on earth.

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,900
And some of them...
some of them...

462
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,300
shop at Victoria's Secret...

463
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,300
Beth Kramer has never been
so mortified in her entire life.

464
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Beth Kramer's a tight-assed,
busy body cunt...

465
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,700
and it's none of her business
how l speak to my son.

466
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,300
She is a decent parent
and great friend.

467
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,400
Bullshit!
Just change one visitation day.

468
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
What is so terrible?

469
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,200
No! He is not going to miss school!

470
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,000
lf Hilly was sick
he would miss school!

471
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,500
Yes, he would.
But he's not sick...

472
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,800
and he's not spending the day
with his pill-popping...

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
alcoholic...

474
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,200
beaver-banging
excuse for a father.

475
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,200
Years ago you didn't say that
about me.

476
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,200
-You were an easy-going spirit...
-Put it in a book.

477
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,500
What am l saying?

478
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,100
You already did.

479
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,600
"Epstein had married
his third shrink.

480
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,300
He'd confessed his
feelings for her often.

481
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
She seemed to put it down
to transference

482
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,500
But one day she surprised him."

483
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,900
l think it best...

484
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,800
that we terminate your
treatment.

485
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
And then, l think we should...

486
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,900
give it a substantial
period oftime.

487
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,100
Then, if we both feel
the same way...

488
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
l think we can begin
to see each other again...

489
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,800
socially.

490
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,500
"lt was, to Epstein thinking...

491
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,500
a match made in Heaven.

492
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,800
Here, at last, was a woman who
understood him."

493
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,600
You know all my secrets,

494
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,900
every nuance of my psychic life.

495
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,900
l've admitted every feeling
and desire in therapy.

496
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,200
Now it's your turn
to explore me.

497
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,100
Yeah, but you accept
all my perversions.

498
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Being tied up, watching you
with other women.

499
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,100
Feeling your spike heels
in my mouth.

500
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,700
Non one can say l didn't know...

501
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,400
what l was letting myself in for.

502
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
The first two years
were amazing.

503
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,300
They moved to a West
Side apartment.

504
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
He wrote.
She saw patients.

505
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,600
But her best insights
were into his work.

506
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,000
What one comes away with
is your total isolation.

507
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Your fear of people,
your panic over closeness.

508
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,300
And that's why your real life
is so chaotic...

509
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,300
and your writing
is so much more...

510
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,000
controlled and stable.
You're unable to..

511
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,900
lt all went quite well...

512
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,700
until Helen became pregnant
and gave birth.

513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,600
From then on, as if she'd
had a divine revelation...

514
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
She became what Epstein
referred to angrily...

515
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
as "Jewish with a vengeance."

516
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,200
l rue the day
l listened to you...

517
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,600
and l didn't have him
circumcised.

518
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,300
Are you nuts?

519
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,800
We can still do it.

520
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,800
No!

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
He's too old.

522
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,000
-Sure. Now he's too old.
-What is wrong with you?

523
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,600
You're like a born-again Christian
except you're aJew.

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
l see my father's face in Hillel.

525
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Hilliard. His name is Hilliard.

526
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,100
We didn't name him Hillel.
Not after some rabbi.

527
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
Hilliard Epstein.

528
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,100
l'm sick of smug cynicism.
There's value in tradition.

529
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,700
l thought it meant nothing,
but nowthat l'm a mother, it does.

530
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,500
l see not only meaning
in Judaism, but true beauty.

531
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,300
You're a scientist!

532
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,700
Einstein was a scientist!

533
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,100
And he was a Jew!
And he was religious!

534
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,100
"Helen had taken on
the obligation of daily prayers.

535
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,900
Jews, of course, fearing
a wrathful and vengefulgod...

536
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,900
give praise and thanks
for everything."

537
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,000
Baruch atah adonai elohenu melech
ha-olam...

538
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,800
borei pree hagofen.

539
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,900
Hamotzi lechem...

540
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,700
min ha-oretz.

541
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,000
Vitzi-vonu l'hadlik nair

542
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,700
Boreh pree ha...blowjob.

543
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,500
And one day the inevitable
happened.

544
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,200
A patient of Helen's,
an lsraeli...

545
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,700
who had come to her, depressed
that his wife had left him...

546
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,700
captured Helen's heart."

547
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,100
l think it best...

548
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,300
that we terminate your
treatment,...

549
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,000
give it a substantial time.

550
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,500
Then, if we feel the same way...

551
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,600
start to see each other...

552
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,000
socially.

553
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,800
Lost in thought, l think.

554
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
l was just, l was thinking
about a book l wrote.

555
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,000
-Well, l'm a mess.
-What's the matter?

556
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,100
l'm going to the doctor.
l have pains in my chest.

557
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,200
lt's nothing.

558
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,200
lt's indigestion or gallbladder
or acid reflux...

559
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,700
l've got a family history.
My dad died of heart attack...

560
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,700
my mother died
of a massive coronary.

561
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,100
Both brothers died before they
were 50 from heart failure.

562
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,100
Why waste time talking?
Get an ambulance.

563
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
Are you busy?

564
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,700
l was going to see my editor.

565
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,500
l just hate going alone.

566
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,900
My mother died
giving birth to me.

567
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,600
For which my father
never forgave me.

568
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,500
lt's funny. l wish before he died,
l had forgiven him.

569
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,700
But we're morbid. You think
you're dying but you're not.

570
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,200
Today they got lasers,
all kinds of...

571
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, you and science, right?

572
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,500
Nothing wrong with science.

573
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Between air-conditioning and the
Pope, l'll take air-conditioning.

574
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,300
l'm scared.
l'm really scared.

575
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Can l change the subject?
You know l have writer's block?

576
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,100
l know.

577
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,100
l have awriter's block.

578
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,600
First time in my life...

579
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,700
l can't come up with an idea,
something to hold my interest.

580
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,500
Since Fay left you you've been
having trouble.

581
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,600
l'm seeing Fay later
for a drink.

582
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,600
l think is very good.

583
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,700
She's good for you.
She's a lot better than...

584
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,200
a lot of those other
crazies that...

585
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,700
My God! My arm!

586
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,300
l'm telling you it's nothing.
Nothing.

587
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,400
l'm not scared.

588
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
-You're in great shape.
-Really?

589
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,600
You just have a little
bursitis in your arm.

590
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,300
That's fantastic!
My God, thank you!

591
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,500
The loveliest words
to hear are not, "l love you"...

592
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
but "lt's benign."

593
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,500
We could do more tests,
but l don't think so.

594
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,100
Your heart's in great shape.

595
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,800
l hurt my back some weeks a go
opening a sub-zero refrigerator.

596
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,400
-Let me buy a cup of coffee.
-Let me schedule you.

597
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,100
-No. l don't have time.
-Let me schedule you.

598
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,600
What are you doing tomorrow?

599
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
l'm busy. Why?

600
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,000
l'm going to my old school.
The honoring me.

601
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
l'd like someone
to come with me.

602
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,000
l can't get out of this thing...

603
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
but that's great.

604
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,700
Congratulations.

605
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,600
-You look great.
-Thank you.

606
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,000
You look a little tired.

607
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,200
l'm struggling with this book.

608
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,700
Naturally, l spent the advance...

609
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,700
and l'm having atough...

610
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
a tough time.

611
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,500
l wanted to have
this drink because...

612
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
Can l get a red wine?

613
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,100
Same thing she has, please?

614
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,700
l wanted to be the first
to tell you that...

615
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,300
l'm getting married.

616
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Don't say that!

617
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
-Why?
-What do you mean?

618
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,700
Because...

619
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,100
l love you.
How can you get married?

620
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,300
Don't!

621
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
-Who? ls it Larry?
-Yes, it's Larry!

622
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,700
l knew it!

623
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,200
l don't fucking believe this!

624
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,000
This guy's allegedly
a friend of mine.

625
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,000
lt's the Devil.
And l introduced you.

626
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,800
When Larry's around.
l smell burning sulfur.

627
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,700
Can we have your blessing?

628
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,100
No! You certainly
don't have my blessing!

629
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,200
l don't want you
to get married.

630
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,000
l don't want you to.

631
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,200
l should go.

632
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
l was your pupil.

633
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,200
lt was Henry Higgins
and Eliza Doolittle.

634
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
That's what it was,
and that's what you loved.

635
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,700
But it didn't work that way.
What can l say?

636
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
Why did you
fall in love with me?

637
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,500
You gave me endless lectures
on love in the Western world.

638
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,500
l didn't think l could.
l thought l was too damaged.

639
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,100
l woke up one morning, and
l looked at you over breakfast...

640
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,300
and l thought to myself...

641
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,700
God, this is what they mean.

642
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,700
This is what they were
talking about.

643
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,700
All those warnings not to
fall in love with you!

644
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,000
But then l fell in love with you.

645
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,200
Thought you were
another jerk fan...

646
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
l'd fuck you...

647
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,900
and move on to the next fan.
But that didn't happen.

648
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,300
You were a fan...

649
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,700
and a follower...

650
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,100
and then a pupil...

651
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,300
and then you were a roommate.

652
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
And before l knew it...

653
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,500
you had control
ofthe channel changer.

654
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,700
l loved you.

655
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,800
l was in awe of you.

656
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,600
But it wasn't in love with you.

657
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,300
My old university is honoring me,
if you can believe that.

658
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Come with me, let me try
to talk you out of it...

659
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,800
Just one day.

660
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,600
l'm getting married tomorrow.

661
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,200
-Tomorrow? The day l'm honored?
-Yes! Tomorrow!

662
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,100
l can't fucking believe this.

663
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,200
You're getting married tomorrow?

664
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,300
Yes. lt's been planned for months!

665
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,800
Don't do it!

666
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,200
"While Goldberg was asleep
onenight...

667
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
the devil entered his apartment...

668
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
abducted his beautiful
blonde love...

669
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,200
and took her to hell.

670
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,100
The next morning...

671
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,600
Goldberg noticed the odd smell of
burning sulfur".

672
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,300
Harry Block?

673
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,100
You're Cookie?

674
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Cookie Williams.

675
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,100
You wanted me here at ten?

676
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,100
You wanna, shall we get to it?

677
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
You don't want to talk
a little first?

678
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,000
Talk? Why?

679
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,100
Really? Most guys don't
like to jump into bed...

680
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,100
without talking. They think it's
too businesslike.

681
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,500
Not me. l'm not...

682
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,000
that you'd tie me up.

683
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,600
Whatever you want! Let's settle
the monetary part and then relax.

684
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
Absolutely.

685
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,700
-You get $200?
-That's right.

686
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,900
So you want me to tie you up?

687
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Yeah, tie me up.

688
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,700
l'd like you to hit me...

689
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,500
and give me a blowjob.

690
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,500
A blowjob, then you hit you.

691
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,700
No.

692
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,500
Hit me and then the blowjob.

693
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,300
lf the order's not right,
it's no fun.

694
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,700
Tie me up, hit me,
give me a blowjob.

695
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,200
What should l tie you with?

696
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,700
The truth is l thought you
were going to wear stockings.

697
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,700
Cookie,
you're a definite artist.

698
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,300
They should put your lips
in the Smithsonian.

699
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,000
lt took you awhile.
l didn't think you'd make it.

700
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,700
l was having a little
problem focusing.

701
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,000
Finally, l got the right fantasy.

702
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,800
l thought of awoman l saw
in the Sixth Avenue...

703
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,300
and l coupled herwith
Svetlana Stalin.

704
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,100
lt's the daughter of the dictator.
lt worked.

705
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,400
What do you take medicine for?

706
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,900
Me? Depression.

707
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,800
What are you depressed about?

708
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,300
Depressed. Don't you ever get
depressed?

709
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,500
Doesn't yourwork get you down?

710
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,200
lt's okay. Beats the hell out of
waitressing.

711
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,400
lt's funny.

712
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,000
Every hooker l meet says it
beats the hell out of waitressing.

713
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,000
Waitressing's got to be
the worst job in the world.

714
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,400
lt's unbelievable.

715
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
What are you sad about?

716
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,300
l'm spiritually bankrupt.
l'm empty.

717
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,000
What do you mean?

718
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
l'm frightened.

719
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
l got no soul.
Knowwhat l mean?

720
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,000
See, when l was younger,
it was less scary...

721
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,000
waiting for Lefty than it is
waiting for Godot.

722
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,500
You lost me.

723
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,600
You know that the universe is
coming apart?

724
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
You know what a black hole is?

725
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,300
Yeah.
That's how l make my living.

726
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,400
l gotta tell you, a great writer
named Sophocles...

727
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,500
said it was probably best
not to be born al all.

728
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,700
Honey, it's a little
too late forthat.

729
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,900
l didn't want to come out.
They had to come in and get me.

730
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,900
You want another blowjob?

731
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,100
How come?

732
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,800
On the house. No charge.

733
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Because them pills you takin'
sure ain't working.

734
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,400
l'm just in a peculiar mood
tonight.

735
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,000
Because l had
some bad news today.

736
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,200
Let me ask you,
what are you doing tomorrow.

737
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Hustlin'.

738
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,700
Yeah?
Why don't you come with me?

739
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,700
Where?

740
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,000
l'm going to my old school.
They're honoring me.

741
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,900
l got nobody to share it with.

742
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,300
l'm serious. Come with me.

743
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
l'll give you 500 bucks.

744
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Sleep here,
come up with me tomorrow.

745
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,500
Why you got all this money?

746
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,800
l always have
hooker money because...

747
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,300
l once paid by check years ago
and the lRS killed me.

748
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,400
Fay, when you get this message,
if it's not too late...

749
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,300
don't get married...

750
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
because l love you...

751
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,000
and l want to marry you.

752
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,000
l was looking at...

753
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,700
my last book...

754
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,600
at the part where we met.

755
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,100
l tried to exaggerate it
to make it funny...

756
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,700
but it was actually
very romantic.

757
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
-She can't hear.
-l'm in town.

758
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,400
Norman's meeting me for "Les Mis."
l have a free hour.

759
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,000
l don't know if l can.

760
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,500
l got our usual place at the
Wyndham. lt's been 2 weeks ago.

761
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,400
We gotta be fast. l can't make it
believable for so long.

762
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,600
You'll be back in an hour.

763
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
l have to be done by then anyway.

764
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,200
Think l'll take awalk.

765
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Now?

766
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,600
Yes, l thought that l would just...

767
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,700
just get some fresh air.

768
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay.

769
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,300
Excuse me.

770
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,300
Are you Harry Block?

771
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,300
Yes.

772
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,800
-Your writing's so meaningful to me.
-Thank you.

773
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,500
l can't believe l'm in
the elevator with you.

774
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,400
lt's no big deal.

775
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,400
Are you staying here?

776
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,900
No. l'm meeting someone.

777
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,100
What is this?

778
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,100
lt's stuck again.

779
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,600
lfthis was one of my stories,
this elevator would get stuck...

780
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,300
and you and l would start a major
affair, and fall in love.

781
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,200
Promise you won't
fall in love with me.

782
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,500
No?

783
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
Definitely not.
Not a good idea.

784
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,900
Why?

785
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,100
Because...

786
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,100
l'm too screwed up.

787
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
l have...

788
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
too many quirks.

789
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,400
l have trouble being faithful.

790
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,700
l have too many phobias.
l'm crazy.

791
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,600
Yeah, but l fell in love with you
before l met you.

792
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,800
When l read you.

793
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,200
Yes, but you fell in love
with my work.

794
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,500
That's a different thing.

795
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,500
l love yourwork.
l love your imagination.

796
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,200
l love it.

797
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,900
But this is not a book.
You know what l mean.

798
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,800
We're not characters
in a fictional thing.

799
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,100
-So don't fall in love with me.
-Kiss me.

800
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,900
-Promise you won't.
-No, kiss me.

801
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,300
l promise.

802
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,300
Thank you.

803
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,100
The subway took forever. Sorry.

804
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,700
You said you weren't coming.

805
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,800
What do you mean?

806
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,800
-We said 10. l'm sure.
-No.

807
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
l called last night,
to say l got out of my thing.

808
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
You called? When?

809
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,300
At 9.30 last night.
You don't remember?

810
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,000
l interrupted you writing.

811
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
-We spoke on the phone.
-Absolutely.

812
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,200
My mind has been playing tricks.

813
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,100
This is Cookie Williams,
Richard.

814
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,500
How ya doing?

815
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,800
What's so special
about this honor?

816
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,700
He's being honored by
the school that expelled him.

817
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,200
lf only Hilly could see me,
he'd be so proud.

818
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,800
lt's sad, but short of kidnapping,
he ain't coming.

819
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,300
Oh, dear!

820
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,200
Dad?

821
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,000
-Hilly, Where you going?
-What are you doing?

822
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,700
Stop it!

823
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,800
lt's an emergency.

824
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,100
What are you doing?
Come on!

825
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,000
You can't do this!

826
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,800
Hilly, get out ofthe car!

827
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,500
Somebody stop this man!
He's a deviant!

828
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,300
Somebody stop him!

829
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,000
Somebody call the police!

830
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
-lt's fabulous up here.
-Beautiful.

831
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,100
Look, a ferris wheel!

832
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,600
-Look at the swings!
-Want to go?

833
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,400
Yeah!

834
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,000
Very good!

835
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,600
Would you like this?

836
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,600
Dad, high-five!

837
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,200
You want some ofthis joint?

838
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,300
No. l can't stand that stuff.

839
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,800
You see that place there?

840
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,400
That Red Apple Rest?

841
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,100
Years ago...

842
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,400
my then wife, Jane,
and l...

843
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,600
were coming back from
her sister's house...

844
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,000
and we had a fight.

845
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,400
She had her period, and we
stopped to get water for Midol.

846
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,300
l don't want a child!

847
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,700
And don't bring it up
in front of my parents!

848
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,800
-l don't understand.
-We've discussed it!

849
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,100
-Don't l get a vote?
-You have a child!

850
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,800
-Who l never get to see!
-That's not my fault!

851
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,500
l like being a father.

852
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,500
l'm not Lucy. You knew
that when you married me!

853
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,100
So your work means no children.

854
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,100
Since when are you a family man?

855
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,200
Don't think l don't see
you staring at my sister Lucy.

856
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,100
What?

857
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Don't play ignorant.

858
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,800
You watch her walk and sit.

859
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You can't keep
your eyes off hertoes!

860
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Are you fucking nuts?
What are you suggesting?

861
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,000
l wouldn't put it past you if you
wanted to have athing with her.

862
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,100
She's a neurotic, suburban Hausfrau!

863
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,600
l have no interest in her.
Zero. Nothing.

864
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,200
You're level of denial
is a little intense.

865
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,500
You're suffering from
a pre-menstrual nuclear meltdown.

866
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
You want a hit?

867
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,600
No. That smoke is killing me.

868
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,000
l'm going to go to the bathroom.
Catch you later.

869
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,800
Cold fish, your third ex-wife.

870
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
She never would have made
a good mother.

871
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Who are you?

872
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,900
lt's me. Ken!

873
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,200
Look at this guy! You created me,
now you don't recognize me?

874
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,200
l'm a little bit high because
of her smoke...

875
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
How'd you ever
hook up with Jane?

876
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,200
Jane was fine. Jane was just
having her period. She was...

877
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,200
lt wasn't just her period.

878
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
She was a cold, selfish woman.

879
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,500
She's so self-involved she doesn't
realize her sister hates her.

880
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,800
How do you know so much?

881
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,900
l'm just you, thinly disguised.

882
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,400
You gave me a little more
maturity and a different name.

883
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,300
Are you saying that l knowthis?

884
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,100
Yes!
That's why you picked her!

885
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,000
So it wouldn't work, and you'd
never have to give up...

886
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,700
sport-fucking and chronic
dissatisfaction and grow up.

887
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,200
l won't stand here and get
lectured by my own creation.

888
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,800
You can't fool me.

889
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,300
l'm not your shrink.
He only knows what you tell him.

890
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,500
l knowthe truth.

891
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,400
And her sister, Lucy.

892
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,000
Another head-case.

893
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,400
You sure can pick them.

894
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,500
But even she was better
than Jane.

895
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,100
More maternal and she loved you.

896
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,300
You weren't there the day your
bomb dropped on her...

897
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,600
but take a look.

898
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,300
He left me!

899
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,500
Our marriage is finished!

900
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,100
l'm sorry to hear that.

901
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,700
You shocked?

902
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,000
Yes and no.

903
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Things have not been very good
for some time.

904
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,700
l knew he played around.

905
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,600
Did you?
You never mentioned that.

906
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,600
l don't like to discuss
my private life.

907
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,800
First suspected Lynn, his editor.
Then l thought...

908
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,300
it might be Allison Davis,
a friend of ours.

909
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,400
l even thought he might have
a crush on you.

910
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Me?

911
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,100
You're beautiful and we've spent
a lot oftime together...

912
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,500
and you two get along very well.

913
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,400
Obviously l knew you never would
in a million years...

914
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,800
but l imagined he longed for you.

915
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,700
l even heard him mention
your name in his sleep once.

916
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,000
My goodness.

917
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,700
That's absurd!

918
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,800
Really!

919
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,500
You're all red!

920
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,600
No!

921
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
Are you okay?

922
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,800
Since we're talking openly...

923
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,200
l have a confession to make.

924
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,800
Yes?

925
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,000
Life sometimes takes very
strange twists and turns.

926
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,200
lt overwhelms us, and we can't
help our feelings.

927
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,800
Our feelings are irrational.

928
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,300
But to hear from your husband
that he found another woman!

929
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,100
He said that?

930
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,700
He said his future
is all mapped out.

931
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,600
l'm going to be totally
frank with you.

932
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,600
-Try to hang on and understand.
-What? l'm being replaced.

933
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,600
But it doesn't have to be
a nightmare...

934
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,000
ifwe're all just mature about it.

935
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Replaced by a 25-year-old.

936
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,700
-Excuse me?
-A 25-year-old.

937
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,400
A wanna-be writer. Fay Sexton is her
sexy name.

938
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,000
What's the matter?
Now you're white!

939
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,500
Lucy have you
eaten anything today?

940
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,700
Have a drink.
Finish that.

941
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,600
-How could l believe such a liar.
-l'm weak!

942
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,800
What's wrong?

943
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,300
You'd think he dumped you.

944
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,500
-You feel bad, but can handle it.
-Air!

945
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,000
l'm in shock today, but...

946
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,800
l want to speak to Fay.

947
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,500
lt's Harry Block. l've been trying
to reach her.

948
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,800
No, it's an emergency.
l gotta talk...

949
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,400
Tell her to call me back.
lt's the car number.

950
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,900
Yes. The car!

951
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,200
-She's in love with someone else.
-This guy is too old for her.

952
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,800
Younger than you.

953
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,600
l'm much too old for her.
lt's ridiculous.

954
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,500
-But my immaturity makes me boyish.
-ls it much longer, Dad?

955
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,100
-We just got done at the fair.
-You're speeding.

956
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,000
-About how much longer is it?
-lt won't be long.

957
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,300
Okay, my sister lives
ten minutes from here.

958
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,400
We'll surprise her.
lt'll be fun.

959
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,000
-You can eat and walk around.
-She's your half-sister.

960
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,400
But it'll still be 10 minutes...

961
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,800
not 5, 'cause she's
a half-sister.

962
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,600
lt's wonderful!

963
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,300
-lt is so funny.
-Do you think?

964
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,200
-And it's so sad.
-You're so sweet.

965
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,300
l love it.

966
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,600
You're so great.
You're so kind to me.

967
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,900
You have such a sweet,
kind instinct.

968
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,500
Don't do that.

969
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,300
l count on you
to be critical...

970
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,600
to really be tough.
You're too easy on me.

971
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,200
What's wrong with this?

972
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,300
What's wrong is that it had...

973
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,100
it had no energy.

974
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,200
l became discouraged with it.

975
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,100
lt doesn't release any power.
lt's nothing.

976
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,900
l thought it was really touching.

977
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,300
You knew when the boy grew up
he would never learn to love.

978
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,800
l think your problem is...

979
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,300
that you love too easily,
and too much.

980
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,300
l think you're beautiful,
and great...

981
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,200
and too kind to me, and lovely.

982
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,200
But you're not in love with me.

983
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,700
l told you not to fall
in love with me.

984
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,100
But still haven't
figured out why.

985
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,100
Why? Because l'm the boy
in that story...

986
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
and l can't love.

987
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,200
So, l don't want you to
get into anything.

988
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,100
You love Hilly.

989
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,900
What?

990
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,600
You love Hilly.

991
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,900
Sure. l love Hilly.

992
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,000
He's my son. lt's easy to love
a little kid.

993
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,400
You love music.

994
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,900
And you love baseball.

995
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,400
Baseball's also easy,
because it has rules, foul lines...

996
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,900
but women are complicated.

997
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,600
Happy birthday.

998
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,100
You're kidding!

999
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,500
Come on, open it up.

1000
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,400
You didn't have to
get me anything.

1001
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,400
Another sweater, right?

1002
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,400
A baseball signed by
the 1951 Giants.

1003
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,400
Really! That's so great!

1004
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,700
Bobby Thomson!

1005
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
They were the one genuine miracle
of my lifetime!

1006
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,600
When he hit that home run...

1007
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,900
it was the only hint l've had
there may be a God.

1008
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,900
What made you think of it?

1009
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,100
lt was easy.

1010
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,600
You are the greatest.

1011
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,900
lt's your birthday,
so you get awish.

1012
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,300
Anything at all that'll make
your day special.

1013
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,600
You are the greatest.
l don't deserve you.

1014
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,200
You're too...

1015
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,500
Too what?

1016
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,200
-We thought we'd stop in to see you.
-Come in!

1017
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,800
This is Richard.
This is Cookie.

1018
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,300
l'm your Aunt Doris.
You won't remember me.

1019
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,900
Remember Uncle Burt?

1020
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,600
You haven't seen him
in awhile.

1021
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,000
lt's been a long while.

1022
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,300
Something to eat?
A cookie or something?

1023
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,000
Come in the kitchen.

1024
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,200
l gotta go to the bathroom.
Where's the john?

1025
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,200
The bathroom! You just go right
through there.

1026
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,700
So, l thought we'd drop in.

1027
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,600
You're the last person
l ever expected to see.

1028
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,500
Don't say that, Doris.

1029
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,400
-And what's with Cookie?
-Cookie's the nanny.

1030
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,900
You get her from an agency
or massage parlor?

1031
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,900
What are you picking on...

1032
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,400
Still with the sex pots,
the tramps, the vilda chayes.

1033
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,300
She's got a Ph.D.

1034
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,100
l bet she got an "A" on her
oral exam.

1035
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,800
Give me a break!
l drive upstate...

1036
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,500
and take the time to drop in
to say hello.

1037
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,600
Can you believe they're
honoring me at Adair? l can't.

1038
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,200
Not that l care, but it's great
for Hilly to see me.

1039
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,900
The last time l saw him
he was six years old.

1040
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,400
You don't exactly contact me either.

1041
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,100
l know what you think of me.

1042
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,600
Please Doris, don't start in.

1043
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,800
Am l wrong?
lt's all in your book.

1044
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,300
"Too Jewish",
"professional Jewish".

1045
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,400
You attributed it to your ex-wife,
but used the details of my life...

1046
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,900
to depict herwith contempt.

1047
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,300
-What are you talking about?
-What am l talking about?

1048
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
You portrayed your 'ex'
as a horror.

1049
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,100
And to make her unsympathetic,
you used some of her,...

1050
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,800
but mostly you caricatured
my religious dedication.

1051
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,700
Because it always enraged you that
l returned to my roots.

1052
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,200
What roots? You were a wonderful,
sweet kid.

1053
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,700
You got me through my childhood.

1054
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,200
Then you go to Fort Lauderdale...

1055
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,400
and you meet this fanatic,
this zealot.

1056
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,400
He fills you full of superstition.

1057
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,100
lt's tradition.

1058
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,600
Tradition is the illusion
of permanence.

1059
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,400
You have no values.
Your life...

1060
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,000
it's nihilism, cynicism,
sarcasm and orgasm.

1061
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,200
ln France l could run on
that slogan and win.

1062
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,800
l'm aJew. l was born aJew.
Do you hate me because ofthat?

1063
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,900
And if our parents converted...

1064
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,600
to Catholicism a month before you
were born, we'd be Catholics.

1065
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,300
They're clubs.
They're exclusionary.

1066
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,200
They foster the concept of
"the other"...

1067
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,400
so you know who to hate.

1068
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,100
That's enough!

1069
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,600
A question: lf a Jew
gets massacred...

1070
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,800
does it bother you more than
if it's a Gentile...

1071
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,400
or a black or a Bosnian?

1072
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,100
Yes, it does. l can't help it.
lt's my people.

1073
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,900
They're all your people.

1074
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,600
Burt is right about you.
You're a self-hating Jew.

1075
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,500
l may hate myself,
but not because l'm Jewish.

1076
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,200
Not a self-hating Jew,...

1077
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,100
but look how he talks about them
in his stories.

1078
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,700
Max and Dolly Pincus
were married for 30 years.

1079
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,500
They raised two children...

1080
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,300
participated generously at
family weddings and bar mitzvahs.

1081
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,300
Max, How are you?

1082
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,700
Mazel tov. Here, for Donald.

1083
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,900
Thank you, Max.

1084
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,200
Dolly!

1085
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,200
You got a private minute?

1086
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,200
Sure. We're leaving anyhow
in a few minutes.

1087
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,900
l don't know if
l should tell you.

1088
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,500
What? Tell me what?

1089
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,600
Tell me, and l'll tell you
if you should tell me.

1090
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,400
My heart is heavy.

1091
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,800
Nothing terrible happened
to your husband Phil, did it?

1092
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,000
He's been dead for so many years.

1093
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,200
When l was in Florida last week...

1094
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,800
l ran into a man...

1095
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,100
who heard from someone
who knew someone who...

1096
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,300
Anyway...

1097
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,600
it seems Max has some secret
from his past.

1098
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,500
You're talking about my Max?

1099
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,700
-A dark secret.
-What kind of a dark secret?

1100
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,700
Dark!

1101
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,600
What is by you dark?

1102
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
l don't know.

1103
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,900
What kind of dark secret?
We've been married for 30 years.

1104
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,900
You're his first wife?

1105
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,900
Sure l'm his first wife.

1106
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,800
Before me, he worked for...

1107
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,800
What?

1108
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,300
You heard something different?

1109
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,500
l heard only a dark secret.
Do l knowwhat?

1110
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,300
Who told you?

1111
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,500
Wolf Fishbein.

1112
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,400
Be careful, Dolly.

1113
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,700
That's all l want to say.

1114
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,100
Dolly tried putting Elsie's words
out of her mind...

1115
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,800
but Max's dark secret
plagued her.

1116
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,000
Then one day she ran into
Wolf Fishbein...

1117
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,600
and the truth was revealed.

1118
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,800
Try to breathe deeply.

1119
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,900
Elsie, you were right.

1120
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,300
Fishbein told me a tale.

1121
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,500
Max, before l met him,
lived in Florida.

1122
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,200
He had a store. Groceries.

1123
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,000
He was married.

1124
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,000
Now it comes out!

1125
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
To a woman...

1126
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,200
with two children.

1127
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,200
Max had other children?

1128
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,300
No. The woman's children.

1129
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,600
From a prior marriage.

1130
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,800
He began an affair...

1131
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,700
with the downstairs neighbor,
a widow.

1132
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,000
He probably had all his hair then.

1133
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Meanwhile, he got into debt.

1134
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,900
Deeper and deeper.

1135
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,300
And then carry on
with the neighbor.

1136
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,900
Oy, my heart!

1137
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,200
He can't get himself out
of a predicament.

1138
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,400
So what does he do?

1139
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,200
He stole money.

1140
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,000
l should be so lucky!

1141
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,000
He killed his wife!

1142
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,000
No!

1143
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,900
The man purchased an ax.

1144
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,400
With an ax?

1145
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,000
You know Max.
He's nothing with tools.

1146
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,500
He can't even hang a picture.

1147
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,000
l'm dropping dead!

1148
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,500
Plus her children!

1149
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,700
Plus the neighbor!

1150
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,800
Four.

1151
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,000
Four people he killed
in one night with an ax.

1152
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,100
Your Max?

1153
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,100
-And this is not the capper.
-There's more?

1154
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,500
More!

1155
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,800
What more?

1156
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,700
He ate them.

1157
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,600
What, are you talking crazy?

1158
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,800
He devoured them.

1159
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,900
l can't breathe.
Everything is closing in.

1160
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,200
Whatever you do...

1161
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,400
first hear Max's side.

1162
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,300
Max has a side?

1163
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,900
He kills his family
and eats them up.

1164
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
The man has a side?

1165
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,300
He was a good husband and
loving father for 30 years.

1166
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,600
You have a daughter who
went to college.

1167
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,800
You have a son who's awriter.

1168
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,400
Maybe the best course of action
is to let sleeping dogs lie.

1169
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,800
Honey, would you
pass the sour cream?

1170
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,300
You haven't touched a thing.

1171
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,200
Nice weather.

1172
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,100
lt's okay.

1173
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,000
lt's not just okay.
lt's nice.

1174
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,600
All right. What are you getting
so steamed up about?

1175
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,100
What makes you such an
authority on the weather?

1176
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,300
Me?

1177
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,400
-All l said was...
-l know what you said.

1178
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,600
The fish is delicious.

1179
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,900
Wouldn't you rather have meat?

1180
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,200
Since when do l eat meat?

1181
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,800
With my arteries, you gotta
watch the cholesterol.

1182
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,700
-Uh-huh.
-What is the "uh-huh"?

1183
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
You've been very touchy lately.

1184
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,700
Don't interrogate me...

1185
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,600
Mr. Max Pinchick!

1186
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,000
Where did you hearthat name?

1187
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,900
Did you kill your first wife
with an ax?

1188
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,000
l got a headache.

1189
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,700
Did you chop her up?
Along with your mistress?

1190
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,300
Okay.

1191
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,100
lf l tell you why l did it,
do you promise not to nudge me?

1192
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,600
Wolf Fishbein said,
in orderto hide the bodies...

1193
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,200
you ate them!

1194
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,000
So, what are you making a fuss?

1195
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,700
Some bury,
some burn...

1196
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,000
l ate!

1197
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,200
l remember "Max Pincus's
Dark Secret".

1198
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,300
And you don't see your
sick view of our parents?

1199
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,300
l wrote it when l was young.

1200
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,000
The first of many anti-Semitic
pieces ofwork.

1201
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,100
Direct from the Wailing Wall.

1202
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,900
Disrespectful.
Shameful.

1203
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,600
The Jews haven't suffered enough,
you depict us as cannibals?

1204
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,000
No spiritual center.
He's betting on physics and pussy.

1205
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,600
Excuse the expression.

1206
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,500
He gets cancer, he's straight to
the synagogue in a yarmulke.

1207
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,000
Why should l get cancer?
l eat broccoli.

1208
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,000
You care about the Holocaust?
Or you think it never happened?

1209
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,400
Not only do l know that
we lost 6 million...

1210
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,200
the scary thing is that
records are made to be broken.

1211
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,300
l know what's out there.
Do you?

1212
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,000
He creates offensive Jewish
stereotypes, like in "Der Sturmer".

1213
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,500
Max is a version of Daddy,
who you hated.

1214
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,600
A man you accuse of being
aterrible parent.

1215
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
He was aterrible parent.

1216
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,000
Thank you for dropping by.

1217
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,400
Come again in another 4 years.

1218
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,200
Wouldn't it be a better world
if not every group...

1219
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,200
thought they had a direct line
to God.

1220
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,400
He thinks l'm all
Jewish paranoia.

1221
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,200
No. l think you're the
opposite of a paranoid.

1222
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,700
l think you have the delusion
that people like you.

1223
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,000
-What's the matter?
-Son of a bitch!

1224
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,300
What's wrong?

1225
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,200
You sick, sick, sick,...

1226
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,000
fucking bastard!

1227
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,200
What's wrong?

1228
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,700
What's wrong? You've been having
an affair with one of my patients.

1229
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,200
Who?

1230
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,600
You know what
l'm talking about!

1231
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,300
Don't speak!

1232
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,700
She just told me
the whole thing.

1233
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,900
-Who?
-Who? Who! Who!

1234
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,100
Mrs. Pollack. Amy Pollack.

1235
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,900
Can l explain something?

1236
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,600
No. You cannot explain anything!

1237
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,000
Will you calm down?

1238
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,800
Don't tell me to calm down!

1239
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,400
What's wrong with you?

1240
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,700
What is wrong?

1241
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,900
l treat this woman
and she exits.

1242
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,500
You meet her and you fuck her!

1243
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,700
Suppose l told you that
my fucking Amy Pollack...

1244
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,900
was a disguised plea for
more closeness with you?

1245
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,900
l'd say you're a mental case!

1246
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,400
This is like your first wife.
You claimed you loved her.

1247
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,000
All the while, you were
having affairs.

1248
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,800
My first wife. l told you...

1249
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,600
we were in bed one night.
l turned off her...

1250
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,600
because the way the light was,
she looked like Max Schmeling.

1251
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,600
What do you want me to say?

1252
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,000
She was pretty, but l couldn't
get an erection after that.

1253
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,600
Stop this tap-dancing.
This is bullshit, understand me?

1254
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,800
With you it's a different story.
You turned off me!

1255
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,200
That's what happened
since Hilly was born.

1256
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,000
We live platonically,
like brother and sister.

1257
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,900
Don't play "blame the victim"!

1258
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,900
What are you talking about?

1259
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,100
l'm as much a victim as you!

1260
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,500
You think getting a blowjob...

1261
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,300
from a big-bosomed 26 year old
is pleasurable for me.

1262
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,200
You're making me sick!
l can't believe this!

1263
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,600
-You're overreacting.
-l'm not overreacting!

1264
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,800
Are you telling me that
every week for 4 months...

1265
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,300
you've been with her in a hotel?

1266
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,900
That's so crazy.
No, of course not!

1267
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,900
l rented an apartment.

1268
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,600
l'm going to kill you!

1269
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,000
Hello, Doctor.
Sorry l'm late.

1270
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,400
Mr. Farber.

1271
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,800
Take off your coat.
Come in.

1272
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,300
l've been losing sleep at night.

1273
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,200
l can't shut my eyes at night.

1274
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,400
l think l should quit my job,
but l can't bring myselfto do it.

1275
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,000
Maybe because my brother-in-law
treats me kindly.

1276
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,400
But working for him is taking
it's toll on me emotionally.

1277
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,200
Could you excuse me?

1278
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,000
What?

1279
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,800
You fucked-up fuck!

1280
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,500
l can't believe you did this.
You fucking asshole!

1281
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,300
You fucked my patient!
You don't fuck somebody's patient.

1282
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,000
Fuck you!

1283
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,100
Continue, Mr. Farber.

1284
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,900
Lost your thread? You were talking
about quitting yourjob.

1285
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,300
Right.

1286
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,500
l discussed it with my wife.

1287
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,200
While she seems to be supportive...

1288
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,400
l know she'd rather l stay on.

1289
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,300
She idolizes Gordon.

1290
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,400
All she does is spend time
with him anyway.

1291
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,800
Excuse me one more second,
Mr. Farber.

1292
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,500
Again?

1293
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,500
Continue. l can hear you
from the hallway. Loudly.

1294
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,700
l want you to get out of here.

1295
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,000
Get all of your
goddamn stuff together...

1296
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,900
and get out of here.

1297
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,800
l cannot understand why
the most sophisticated of women...

1298
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,800
can't tell the difference between...

1299
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,600
a meaningless, hot, passionate
sexual affair...

1300
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,600
and a nice, solid, tranquil,
routine marriage.

1301
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,800
Tell me, was she the only one,
orwere there others?

1302
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,500
Amy Pollack was the only one.
May God strike me dead if l lie.

1303
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,900
You're an atheist, Harry!

1304
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,400
We're alone in the universe.
Gonna blame that on me too?

1305
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,400
You turned off me first.

1306
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,200
Oh, please!

1307
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,700
No. l gave birth.
When women give birth...

1308
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,500
there's a period when
their hormones go crazy.

1309
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,400
But they settle.

1310
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,900
So, if you're telling me
you're settling, l accept that.

1311
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,600
You accept that!

1312
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,100
You are so fucking nuts!

1313
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,200
Take it easy!

1314
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,600
lf you're not happy
in a marriage...

1315
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,100
you don't cheat.

1316
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,200
And with my patient!

1317
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,800
That is a sacred trust!
My patient!

1318
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,700
What do you want?
Who else do l meet?

1319
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,100
l'm working here. We have the baby.
You're always practising.

1320
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,900
We never socialize.

1321
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,900
So now you're blaming me...

1322
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,200
because we don't go out
enough places where you can...

1323
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,800
meet strangers to fuck!

1324
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,800
l was merely explaining...

1325
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,400
why my choice, of necessity,...

1326
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,700
is confined to your practice.

1327
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,200
l knew you were mentally ill
before we were married...

1328
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,000
but l thought, as atrained
professional, l could help you.

1329
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,300
Now, please don't get down
on yourself as a therapist.

1330
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,700
Get your shit and your
goddamn clothes...

1331
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,100
and get the fuck out of here!

1332
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,800
You are the most
irresponsible person...

1333
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,800
l've seen in my entire life!

1334
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,300
Get out!

1335
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,400
Continue, Mr. Farber.

1336
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,100
Doctor!

1337
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,200
And l mean tonight,
motherfucker!

1338
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,300
Dad! My Pepsi!

1339
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,500
So you got even with your
exwife and sister and l was born.

1340
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
What do you mean?

1341
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,400
From your pen. From your
fertile imagination.

1342
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,200
And l mean, imagination.

1343
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,000
l wasn't getting even with Joan.

1344
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,900
You created me as the
shrewish, Jewish hybrid...

1345
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,600
who goes off with a patient.

1346
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,500
An Orthodox divorcee
from Tel Aviv.

1347
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:58,000
She shouldn't have married Burt.
He's turned her into a zealot.

1348
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,400
She loves you. lt's not her fault
your father persecuted you.

1349
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,700
She was fine until
she wound up...

1350
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,200
with this right-wing hawk.

1351
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,300
So she disappointed you
in her choice of husbands?

1352
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,300
Fuck you! She loves Burt.

1353
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,900
She was a great kid.
She had a flair for physics.

1354
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,400
Suddenly, she's kosher.

1355
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,000
She loves you still...

1356
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,700
despite your condescension
towards her life.

1357
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,900
Does she love me?

1358
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,400
Want to hearwhat
she says about you?

1359
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,600
He's not so bad.
He was a very good brother.

1360
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,300
But Father never forgave him
when his wife died.

1361
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,200
The man is not aJewish man,
that's all!

1362
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,600
All right!

1363
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,200
Poor Harry, he was always lost.

1364
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,100
He never accepted there are
some things you can't know.

1365
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,300
The man is incapable
of an act of faith.

1366
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,300
Forthat, l pity him.

1367
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,000
l'd like to hug him,
like when we were kids.

1368
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,200
lf l was upset, he was
a real comfort to me.

1369
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,900
What happens to us?

1370
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,900
She can't hear you.

1371
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,500
And as for Joan...

1372
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,500
Joan hates me.

1373
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,000
Shouldn't she?

1374
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,700
Why? Because l was unfaithful?

1375
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,200
No, because when she caught you,
you weren't a man.

1376
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,700
You turned into this
double-talking,

1377
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,200
wise-cracking, tap-dancing liar.

1378
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,800
lf she hadn't been so enraged,
we might have patched things up.

1379
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,600
Listen to him delude himself!

1380
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
Maybe it had tapered a bit
after Hilly was born...

1381
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,000
but you had sex pretty regularly.

1382
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,300
l've no idea why l
took up with her patient.

1383
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,800
She was available and adorable.

1384
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
My marriage was droning on.

1385
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,600
What you call "droning on",
most people would call "working".

1386
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,900
lf that's "working",
marriage isn't for me.

1387
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,300
lt's not for everyone.

1388
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,100
But then l get lonely.

1389
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,600
What do you want me to say?

1390
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,000
She gave me Hilly and for that
l'm eternally grateful...

1391
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,900
'cause l love him so much.

1392
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,000
You can have any one you want.

1393
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,000
Can l get two?

1394
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,400
Tell you what,
you can get three presents.

1395
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,200
Pick any three presents you want.
Satisfied?

1396
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,900
Look what l found.

1397
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,600
lsn't that cool?

1398
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,000
This is the chemistry set
you always wanted. lt's perfect.

1399
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,700
Don't open it yet.
Let me buy it first.

1400
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,500
Larry! What are you doing here?

1401
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,600
Buying my nephew
a Power Ranger.

1402
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,400
-When did you get back?
-A couple of days ago.

1403
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,700
This is Larry.
l told you about Larry.

1404
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,600
He's an old friend,
colleague, peer.

1405
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,000
-So you got back, when?
-Two days ago.

1406
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,400
l took a boat trip
down the Amazon.

1407
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,100
-Sounds exciting.
-Unbelievable.

1408
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,800
lf you don't mind malaria.

1409
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,400
Butterflies the size of doves.
Never seen anything like it.

1410
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,800
l can live without that.

1411
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,600
lt was astounding.

1412
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,800
Sounds it.

1413
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,700
So you got back two days ago?

1414
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,500
We go back a long way.

1415
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,100
We both wanted to be Kafka.

1416
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,700
You got slightly closer
than l did.

1417
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,600
Yeah. l became the insect.

1418
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:57,100
l'm very excited.
l'm amazed.

1419
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,600
We should go out.

1420
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,100
Why not come to my house
in East Hampton for a weekend?

1421
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,300
Let's not get hysterical.

1422
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,500
-l'd love to. lt'd be fun.
-lt's beautiful.

1423
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,000
lt's sand in the crotch, ticks...

1424
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,100
You get this guy
to leave his room.

1425
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,500
He's never had atan.

1426
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,900
l've always wanted
to learn how to snorkel.

1427
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,800
Snorkel! Where he lives,
there are sharks.

1428
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,300
You see photos of guys
with stumps for legs and arms.

1429
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,800
-Am l lying?
-Yes. lt's fabulous there.

1430
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,200
l'll take you to dinner.

1431
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,100
No! We'll take you to dinner.

1432
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,700
l'll tell you about the Amazon.

1433
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,700
l'd love to hear it.
Sounds amazing.

1434
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,600
l'm writing a novel.
l'll tell you about it.

1435
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,400
l'm not into the Amazon.
Know what the Amazon is?

1436
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,500
Tiny little heads with
lips sewn together.

1437
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,900
Can you picture him this way?

1438
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,000
We'll take you to dinner tonight.

1439
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,100
l'm single, available,
with the soul of a black man!

1440
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,300
l smell sulfur.
Do you smell sulfur?

1441
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,900
Hilly, did you open
the chemistry set?

1442
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,800
Look!
We're almost there.

1443
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,800
Hilly, wake up.

1444
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,800
Wake up. We're almost
at the university.

1445
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,900
Dad's being honored.
Limited as my curriculum was.

1446
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,900
-Richard, we're there. 5 minutes.
-Wake up.

1447
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,800
Something's wrong.

1448
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
What's the matter?

1449
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,900
l don't think he's breathing!

1450
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,500
He's dead!

1451
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,500
What?

1452
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,400
l was at the doctor's with him.
They said his heart was fine.

1453
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,900
l'm scared.

1454
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,500
Don't be scared, Hilly.

1455
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,900
l'm fine, Dad.

1456
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,400
Death is a natural part of life.
You have to embrace them both.

1457
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,000
What are we gonna do?

1458
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,300
l don't know.
Get back in the car.

1459
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,200
l don't want to
sit next to him.

1460
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,300
Welcome to Adair University.
l'm Professor Higgins.

1461
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,700
We certainly hope you had
a very pleasant trip here.

1462
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,700
Would you like some refreshments?

1463
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,400
ls he all right?

1464
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,500
He's dead. You got one of
them rubber bags?

1465
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,600
We've made arrangements
forthe body...

1466
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,000
to be delivered to New York City.

1467
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,300
l don't think he has
any immediate family.

1468
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,400
lf you prefer,...

1469
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,000
we can call off the proceedings.

1470
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,500
-l think that's the best idea.
-No!

1471
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:15,800
l do.

1472
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,200
He'll be all right.
He's here for a purpose.

1473
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,900
l'll see that...

1474
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,800
the funeral comes off.

1475
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,000
l'll see that he's buried...

1476
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
properly.

1477
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,000
l understand.

1478
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,900
Poor Richard!

1479
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,600
The poor guy!

1480
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,700
l'm not gonna make it.
l can't go on.

1481
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,100
Not if you keep drinking
and popping those pills.

1482
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,500
l can't believe this.

1483
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,000
My school honors me. l turn up
with a hooker and a dead body.

1484
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,800
Take it easy. You're getting
all wound up about nothing.

1485
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,000
Look at me.

1486
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,100
Look! l'm out of focus!

1487
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,800
You look a little pale,
but you're all right.

1488
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,700
l'm out of focus. l'm soft!

1489
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,000
Calm down. They'll be here
any minute.

1490
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,100
lt's humiliating. They're gonna
honor me and l'm a blob.

1491
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,700
You look fine.

1492
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,400
l'll be sitting
on the dais there, eating.

1493
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,200
They'll get seasick
and throw up.

1494
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,300
Hold my hand.
Now, relax.

1495
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,000
You wanted your son
to see you get honored...

1496
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,100
and now you're acting
like a jackass.

1497
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,000
But don't you see?
l'm a huge blur.

1498
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,100
You're gonna be all right.
l'll talk you down.

1499
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,900
l've seen all kinds of guys O.D.
Heroin, acid, crack.

1500
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,500
l didn't take any ofthat.
l have nothing.

1501
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,100
But you're a pill popper.

1502
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,700
That's not what it is.

1503
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,900
lt's me. l'm OD'ing on myself.

1504
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,800
-l'm a shit.
-Have some coffee.

1505
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
l don't want any coffee.
l'm a shit.

1506
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,400
Talk to me about something.

1507
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,900
You like sports?

1508
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,100
Sports? Yeah.
l was a pitcher.

1509
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,000
When the guy crowded the plate,
l'd throw at his head.

1510
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,700
l'm the worst person
in the world.

1511
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,000
-Honey, l've seen worse.
-Who's worse than me?

1512
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,100
Hitler!

1513
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,300
Maybe Hitler, Goering
and Goebbels, but l'm fourth.

1514
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,000
Come on. Hold my hand.

1515
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,100
-Can you feel my hand?
-Yes, it's warm.

1516
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,800
See? lt's just panic.
You're not a blob.

1517
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,900
l'm going to get over this.

1518
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,100
l'm having a panic attack.

1519
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,000
What sports do you like?

1520
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,900
l like them all. l like baseball,
l like basketball.

1521
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,900
l was married to a woman
who looked like Max Schmeling.

1522
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,800
No, l'm not joking.

1523
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,200
All right. lt's time.

1524
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,400
l can't get through this
without you. l mean it.

1525
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,000
Don't worry about it.

1526
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,800
-lf you didn't come with me...
-Don't worry. Come on.

1527
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,300
Straighten up.

1528
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,900
l gotta get atie.
l gotta get my tie.

1529
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,200
All right. Let's go.

1530
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,600
Are you ready to be
immortalized by Adair?

1531
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,000
We all know your work and characters.
Even the obscure ones.

1532
01:14:55,200 --> 01:15:01,200
Good reading is
a creative act.

1533
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,700
Are you working on anything...

1534
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,000
something we can
sink our teeth into?

1535
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,000
l'm in the midst of writing...

1536
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,500
a thing on the Devil
who kidnaps a man's true love...

1537
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,400
and takes her down to Hell...

1538
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,900
and he goes to retrieve her.

1539
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,900
Since it's Hell, l'm able to...

1540
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,500
settle lots of old scores.

1541
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,300
What's the man like?

1542
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,400
lt's me, thinly disguised.

1543
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,500
ln fact, l don't think l should
disguise it anymore.

1544
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,600
lt's me.

1545
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,100
Floor five...

1546
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,800
muggers, aggressive panhandlers
and bookcritics.

1547
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
Floor six...

1548
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,700
right wing extremists, killers,
lawyers who appearon TV.

1549
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Floor seven...

1550
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,000
the media.

1551
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,300
Sorry, that floor is
all filled up.

1552
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,500
Floor eight...

1553
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,400
escaped war criminals,
TV evangelists and the NRA.

1554
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,800
Lowest level...

1555
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,500
everybody off.

1556
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,700
What did you do?

1557
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,000
l invented aluminum siding.

1558
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,200
Dad!

1559
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,300
Get me out. This is terrible.

1560
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,300
You know how l hate
hot weather.

1561
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,800
What is he doing here?

1562
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,900
He's condemned to
eternal suffering.

1563
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,100
Help me!

1564
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,400
l don't understand.
l demand to know the charges.

1565
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,000
"Behaved unconscionably
toward his son.

1566
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,200
Said the boy committed a
capital crime by being born."

1567
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,700
Your wife, they told me,
is dead.

1568
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,800
But your son, he's thriving.

1569
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,700
Why did he fight
not to be born?

1570
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,400
Look, l forgive him.

1571
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,400
What's over is over.

1572
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,200
lt's finished. Let him
go to heaven, please.

1573
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,800
l'm a Jew! We don't
believe in heaven.

1574
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,400
-Where do you want to go?
-To a Chinese restaurant.

1575
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,100
Take him to Joy Luck.
l love him despite everything.

1576
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,100
Looking for someone?

1577
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,600
l'm here to get Fay.

1578
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,400
She's not coming with you.

1579
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,000
Because you're the head
of the underworld...

1580
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,900
you can abduct her
and get away with it?

1581
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,600
l'm going to kidnap her back.

1582
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,600
-What are you laughing at?
-You match your powers against mine?

1583
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,200
-You want to knowwhy?
-Yeah, l do.

1584
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,700
l'm sorry. Forgive me
for laughing.

1585
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:15,600
Why?

1586
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,400
l'm more powerful because
l'm a bigger sinner.

1587
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,100
Because you're a fallen angel...

1588
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,700
and l never believed in
God or Heaven of any of it.

1589
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,600
l'm strictly quarks
and particles and black holes.

1590
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,400
All the other stuff
is junk to me.

1591
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,400
And also l do terrible things.

1592
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,700
l've cheated on all my wives
and none ofthem deserved it.

1593
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,700
l sleep with whores.

1594
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,100
l drink too much and
l take pills...

1595
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,300
and l lie and l'm
vain and cowardly...

1596
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,900
and l'm prone to violence.

1597
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,400
l once almost ran over
a book critic.

1598
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,200
But l swerved at the last second.

1599
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,200
You ever had two women at once?

1600
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,000
Yes, l did. And l'll tell you
something else.

1601
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,200
l didn't care it was exploitive.
And something else...

1602
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,100
-They were sisters.
-Really?

1603
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,700
Yes! They were two
blond WASP sisters.

1604
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
-Not the Sherman twins?
-Yes, the Sherman twins!

1605
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
They're here.

1606
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,900
The Sherman twins are here?

1607
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,300
Unbelievable!
Do you know Sandra Pepkin?

1608
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,800
Do l know Sandra Pepkin? Only the
best blowjob in the Hadassah.

1609
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,800
So, if you know
Sandra Pepkin...

1610
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,800
l fucked her best friend,
the cripple. Pearl.

1611
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,900
-Pearl in the wheelchair?
-Exactly.

1612
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,500
Speaking of handicaps,
do you know Marie Taylor?

1613
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,100
Yes, but her l don't count.
Marie Taylor is dyslexic.

1614
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,200
She put her Tampax
in her nose.

1615
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,900
-Ever fuck a blind girl?
-No, that l never did.

1616
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,900
Oh, they're so grateful.

1617
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,100
-Would you like a drink?
-You're terrible.

1618
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,400
Could l get some tequila?

1619
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,100
l've got great tequila.
Make yourself at home.

1620
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,700
Want the air conditioner on?

1621
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,000
-You're air-conditioned here?
-Sure. Fucks up the ozone layer.

1622
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
l could be very comfortable here.

1623
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,100
l'll tell you something:
l love it here.

1624
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,100
l wouldn't be any place else.

1625
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,600
-There you go.
-Thank you.

1626
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,600
l've had job offers in your world,
but why be an employee?

1627
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,700
Here, l'm my own boss.
l'm free.

1628
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,100
What jobs did they offer?

1629
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,500
For two years l ran
a Hollywood studio...

1630
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,400
but you can't trust those people.

1631
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,800
l agree. Better to rule
down here...

1632
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,500
than to serve in heaven.
That's Milton.

1633
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,900
To evil!
lt keeps everything humming.

1634
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,600
So you kidnapped Fay?

1635
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,500
Yes, l did.

1636
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,600
Some women are turned on
by aggressive behavior.

1637
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,000
So, if l kidnapped her back?

1638
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,100
You, kidnap?

1639
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,400
Not your style.
You're not a fun guy.

1640
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,400
You're too serious.
Too angry at life.

1641
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,000
l got a lot to be angry at.

1642
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,000
Who doesn't?

1643
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,600
But sooner or later,
you gotta back off.

1644
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,600
lt's like Vegas.
You're up, you're down.

1645
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,200
But in the end,
the house always wins.

1646
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,300
Doesn't mean you
didn't have fun.

1647
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,200
No, one thing you're not
is a kidnapper.

1648
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,300
Kidnapper!

1649
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,200
Listen to me!

1650
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,500
Out of my way! Can't you see
you're with a kidnapper!

1651
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,600
You're going to have to
come with me.

1652
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,300
You're under arrest, Mr. Block

1653
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,500
l gotta put the cuffs on you.

1654
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,100
-He's about to be honored.
-How can l kidnap my own son?

1655
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,300
We got drugs!

1656
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,900
Let me go, bitch!
Let me go!

1657
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,900
-Get them in the car.
-Get off me, bitch!

1658
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,700
Can't l be honored,
then arrested?

1659
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,000
We can't do that. Sorry.

1660
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,200
Kidnapping.

1661
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,700
Prostitute in your car
in possession of marijuana.

1662
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,500
Possession of an
unlicensed firearm.

1663
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,800
l told you about the firearm.
A crazy woman shot at me.

1664
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,200
l got it away from her.
l was gonna hand it in.

1665
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,100
-l gotta make a phone call.
-You made your call.

1666
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,700
Doesn't count. lt was to my
girlfriend's answering service.

1667
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,800
-To stop her marrying.
-You also called your sister.

1668
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,700
My sister wasn't in.

1669
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,000
You called your lawyer.

1670
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,200
He was at Canyon Ranch.
l can never get my lawyer!

1671
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,200
Can l give you some advice?

1672
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,300
You're in deep shit.

1673
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,700
This time l think
you've really had it.

1674
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,600
-lt was your ideato kidnap Hilly.
-lt wasn't my idea.

1675
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,100
l made a joke. You don't act
on every impulse.

1676
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,700
You gotta tell me the truth.
ls it better being dead?

1677
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,600
No, it's not really.
But there's one good thing.

1678
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,200
You don't get jury duty.
But you have no options.

1679
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,500
lt's not for you.

1680
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,000
l'm no good at life.

1681
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,600
No, but you write well.

1682
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,200
That's different. l can manipulate
characters and plots.

1683
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,200
You create your own universe,
nicer than the world we have.

1684
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,900
l can't function in this world.
l'm a failure at life.

1685
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,700
l don't know. l think you bring
pleasure to a lot of people.

1686
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,800
But even that's drying up.

1687
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,600
Forthe last months...

1688
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,200
l've been unable to come up
with a meaningful idea.

1689
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,400
Make peace with your demons...

1690
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,800
and your block will pass.

1691
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,900
lt sounds so trite...

1692
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,200
but l just want to be happy.

1693
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,600
To be alive is to be happy.
Take it from me.

1694
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,700
Block? Come on.

1695
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,700
Some people put up your bail.

1696
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,100
My bail?

1697
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,200
That's right. This way.

1698
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,500
You?

1699
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:32,100
-We got the phone message.
-Came right from our wedding.

1700
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:35,600
-You did?
-We're on our way to our honeymoon.

1701
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,300
-You got married?
-You have to ask?

1702
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,300
l can't believe it! ln the end
you chose him over me!

1703
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,400
-l can't fathom this!
-You'd insult me...

1704
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,200
after we ran from the altar
to bail you out.

1705
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,200
l know you're claustrophobic.

1706
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,400
Plus, you'll get buggered by
every con in the cell block.

1707
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,800
You should be in there!

1708
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,900
Because you stole her from me.

1709
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,900
He did not steal me.

1710
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,300
l love him.

1711
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,700
l can't fathom this.

1712
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,600
l appreciate your coming, but...

1713
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,200
why? Why not me?

1714
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,000
You told me not to fall in love
with you, so l didn't.

1715
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,000
How could you listen to me?
You know l'm crazy!

1716
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,400
You were my mentor. That's why.

1717
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,900
But you were sleeping
with you mentor.

1718
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,300
So? l slept with
my gynecologist.

1719
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,500
What has that
got to do with it?

1720
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,500
You gonna snorkel down the Amazon
with him when you could've had me?

1721
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,100
l'll never be the writer you are.
l know that.

1722
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,200
You put art into yourwork.
l put it into my life.

1723
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,800
l can make her happier.

1724
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,400
l love you.

1725
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,300
l do. lt's just that
l'm in love with Larry.

1726
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:42,900
l'm his wife.

1727
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,600
l love you too, Harry.
Give us your blessing...

1728
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,400
so we can go and enjoy our
honeymoon. Okay?

1729
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,100
We'll be in Santa Fe a month.
When we come back...

1730
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,900
we'll go out.
We're friends.

1731
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,800
He's taking you to the desert
for your honeymoon?

1732
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,400
Yeah. You'd never take me
to the desert.

1733
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,000
The desert is cactus.

1734
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,300
lt's Heela monsters, Gila monsters.
Lizards, is the desert.

1735
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,400
-Harry, please!
-Give us your blessing, please?

1736
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,400
Give 'em your blessings...

1737
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,100
before l throw you back in the
fucking cell and l bugger you!

1738
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,100
l don't know what to say.
l love you.

1739
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,400
This guy...

1740
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,100
l've loved...

1741
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,700
l give up.

1742
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,200
-We'll get you home.
-What am l going to say?

1743
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,600
Santa Fe you're going to take her?
With the tacos?

1744
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,400
What about the honoring ceremony?

1745
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,400
We haven't had the ceremony.

1746
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,400
The police interrupted.

1747
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,800
What, am l dreaming?

1748
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Everybody dreams.

1749
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,100
Come on!

1750
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,700
Professor Clark
has everything planned.

1751
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,700
Can l bring Hilly?

1752
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,600
lt's your dream.

1753
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,500
Stebbins Hall?

1754
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,000
Everyone is waiting
to honor you.

1755
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,500
After all, you created them.

1756
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,600
l love all of you. Really.

1757
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,500
You've given me some of the
happiest moments of my life...

1758
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,400
You've even saved
my life at times.

1759
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,600
And now, you've actually
taught me things.

1760
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,200
And l completely grateful.

1761
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,800
The author's message is...

1762
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,900
"know yourself",
stop kidding yourself.

1763
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,100
Accept your limitations
and get on with your life.

1764
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,900
lt's amazing. To me...

1765
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,500
it's a really
interesting character.

1766
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,600
A guy...

1767
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,700
who can't function well in life...

1768
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,600
but can only function in art.

1769
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,900
lt's sad in away and also funny.
Good for a novel.

1770
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,300
Your books all seem sad
on the surface.

1771
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,500
Which is why l.
like deconstructing them.

1772
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,300
Underneath they're happy.
You just don't know it.

1773
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,400
l tell you.
l feel like l'm in a dream.

1774
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,200
This, for me, is like the best dream
l've had in months.

1775
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,200
The happiest dream.

1776
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,500
l like it!

1777
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,600
A character who's too...

1778
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:32,400
neurotic to function in life...

1779
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,400
but can only function in art.

1780
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,600
Notes for anovel.

1781
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,500
Opening possibility:

1782
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,900
Rifkin led a...

1783
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:44,700
fragmented...

1784
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,700
disjointed...

1785
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:46,700
existence.

1786
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,200
He had long ago come
to this conclusion:

1787
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,100
All people know the same truth.

1788
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,500
Our lives consist of how
we choose to distort it.

1789
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,400
Only his writing was calm...

1790
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,100
his writing, whichhad,
in more ways than one...

1791
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,100
saved his life.
