1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,846
She lives.

2
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,729
They die.

3
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,836
This is the covenant.

4
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:50,845
Is done.

5
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:47,142
The Impaler

6
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,223
Why, yes!

7
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:47,002
Sean!

8
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,074
Why, yes!
- Above!

9
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:52,213
Do you want to go?

10
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:53,543
Do you feel the pressure, "D"?

11
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,915
Do you feel the pressure, buddy?
What will you do when the pressure is on?

12
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,237
You're a little bitch, man!
You're a little bitch!

13
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:02,761
And that affects your game.
And I look at you I will...

14
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,724
One hundred US dollars, if you do this.

15
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,521
What is that, double your capital friend?

16
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:13,510
Oh, you just have to concentrate.

17
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,179
It is very difficult to concentrate.

18
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,675
Oh, shit!

19
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:20,442
No way, man!

20
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:25,322
This comes on the heels!

21
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:29,358
You know, I'm not sure this game, anyway
why actually...

22
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:32,352
I want to drink a few beers and
know that I never lose in this.

23
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,353
Are you ready?

24
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,132
Now I have this.

25
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,371
Oh, my God.
- He drinks it, glug, glug.

26
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:45,165
I know, I will not say anything.
I will not say anything.

27
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,450
Oh, baby!
- Bart.

28
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:55,932
Around this place, apparently
it is good join this charm.

29
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:59,684
I'm happy that you found
a use for that stupid thing.

30
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,627
Wait, I'll let you know
that this is a piece

31
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,015
More advanced technology on the planet.

32
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:10,835
And you use to enter the "Redtube"
to watch porn at the speed of 4G...

33
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:13,383
I do not think Steve Jobs has had that intention

34
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:16,110
I think that when
revolutionary piece of technology.

35
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:18,601
Well, have you seen
Steve Jobs and his friends? - Yeah

36
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:19,617
Have you seen?
- Yes

37
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,416
This is exactly what they did

38
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:25,476
So you can watch porn or whatever.
And do not use it just for that...

39
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,238
I also won $ 200
this weekend.

40
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,444
Would you please finish that
before I lose the bus?

41
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,705
You've smoked too much and this will give
.

42
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,501
What?

43
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,242
We're running out of food.

44
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,571
You...

45
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:41,148
You should get well...

46
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:44,271
Look, you're covered in crumbs
of "cheese puft". - It's okay.

47
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,144
You look like you've been in a snowball
made of "Cheese puft"

48
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,233
How you've been in a radioactive
cheese course

49
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,729
And you'd
become a snowman...

50
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:52,236
And you raised your hand and tell
and the

51
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:53,676
People  "Hello World"
Is that what you want?

52
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:57,708
Guys, you two children,
Have you had sex in her life?

53
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:03,068
Well, I think...
I will stay here and not go into conclusions.

54
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:06,281
Speak for yourself, "Redtube".
Am I right, Lev?

55
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:13,704
Sorry, I will not comment on that question,
but... I really do not see the point.

56
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:14,986
She does not see her point.

57
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:20,760
Okay, that's really sweet of you.

58
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:27,718
I can not believe we're going to
the univerdidad in a few months.

59
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:35,657
You do not have to worry about that, this is
real, I know, let's just enjoy it.

60
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:38,182
You promise?

61
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,461
Actually  "promise"
is the perfect word.

62
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,846
No, no, no, no.
Do not think that is the thing....

63
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,931
This is not a proposition.

64
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,291
This is a promise ring.

65
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,899
Y...

66
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:55,176
I'm going to feel stupid, but...

67
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:59,019
I really want you to know that I love you.

68
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:02,194
And I promise that I will always choose love
.

69
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:19,568
So, do not I have to worry
of the other girls in school?

70
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,115
Someday this will be a proposition.

71
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,965
So you will not have anything to worry
.

72
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:30,776
I hope so.

73
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,684
Do you know that would make this better?
- Chelsea.

74
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,198
Look, I know you feel you know

75
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,003
Same, but really want my first time
.

76
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,715
Our first time, it
on our wedding night.

77
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,185
I know.

78
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:53,798
I know.

79
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:59,622
Hey, when you finally do this, how
husband and wife, that moment will...

80
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:03,365
The most beautiful and best
we have ever spent together.

81
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:08,417
What you will see?

82
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:11,961
Yes.

83
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,068
What I can see.

84
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,570
Hey, "D"!

85
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:19,012
"D", where the fuck are you, man ?!

86
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:22,232
Hey...

87
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,417
Hey, are you okay?

88
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:27,163
Yes, I just felt for a moment...

89
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:30,458
How it was going down.

90
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,574
Okay. All right.

91
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:40,949
Here I am and I do not think so...

92
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,657
I know, I am a virgin...

93
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:45,330
Fuck.
- Oh my God.

94
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,726
Man, we returned.

95
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:49,635
Extrañastes us?

96
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:52,083
Much . More than you think.

97
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,616
I know, I know.

98
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,232
Oh, thanks.

99
00:08:57,143 --> 00:09:00,368
Well, met everyone,
why I had this dream.

100
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,106
Oh, that's great, Steve.

101
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:03,576
This is important.

102
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:07,347
This is the most epic
dreams I've had in my life.

103
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:12,633
It's about this woman, she has red hair
, she was dressed in white...

104
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,770
She had tits...
- Hey!

105
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:19,973
Nena, is just a dream you should not worry
. - It's okay.

106
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:22,331
This woman is back in the game
.

107
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:26,541
She stands before a spooky door...

108
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:29,633
And she's like a vampire
or something.

109
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,597
She had that white veil,
but I could not see his face, but...

110
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,973
But if you could see him clearly
tits.

111
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,376
She led me to the forest...

112
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:40,305
And suddenly
I had that burning of a castle image.

113
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:44,801
This woman called me and told me
"Bring me the circle of seven".

114
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:46,639
That's a good accent, right?

115
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,653
I can not!
I can not forget this dream!

116
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:50,859
I wrote in "Google" castle...

117
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,540
And is called "stone castle".

118
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:54,515
In small words
"Devil's Castle"

119
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:58,618
The castle of my dream is in the middle of Transylvania
.

120
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:00,258
Transylvania?

121
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:02,383
"Transil-damn-vania" man.
I'm not lying.

122
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,468
This castle is now the castle
Vlad "The Impaler"

123
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,142
Vlad "The Impaler", which dominated the entire Romania...

124
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:13,268
The old Dracula fangs large
, you know.

125
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:19,493
Ah, as "Wikepedia"
Castle Dracula's Castle Bram Stoker...

126
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,457
Which is located in the mountains
of the Carpathians in Transylvania...

127
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,727
..and There.

128
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,810
I do not speak of that expedition
shit Bram Stoker.

129
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:28,568
I'm talking about the real castle.

130
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,127
Del  true.
The one I have to define...

131
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,657
Go to location.

132
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,405
Okay, listen guys...

133
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:39,381
The trip you
graduation is next week. - Y?

134
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,121
I want to start paying for everything.

135
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,389
Do you know?
you looking for something... Something really special.

136
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,981
You know ?, because my birthday boy
Thursday next week, and I love the guy.

137
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,054
And everything will merge.

138
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,825
"D", your family has a history
in Transylvania, right?

139
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,180
Yes, but all the families
come from somewhere.

140
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,591
You know?

141
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,223
I thought I was going to move this.

142
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,422
Whatever, yo ..!

143
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:09,709
I rented the castle for a week, so start
pack, guys.

144
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:12,625
Wait, Transylvania?
Why there?

145
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,590
I mean we can go to any part
. Why do not we go to Rome or Paris?

146
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:17,794
Yes - Not prohibited

147
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,091
I want to go to Paris.

148
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:22,326
You. Can go to Rome or Paris
whenever they want, you know.

149
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,227
Always we talked about doing something different.

150
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,109
Right?

151
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,892
Let's do something different.
This is the opportunity.

152
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,024
Do you know?

153
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,486
It not even matters.

154
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:35,391
Why I can pay for my trip.
I pay myself...

155
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:39,408
So they will pay you. - Why?
- And there will be no issue. - Why not?

156
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:45,158
Do you want us to travel to Castle Dracula
?

157
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:47,628
What if the girl
Once your dream, baby?

158
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:51,496
Baby, I see that girl every day.

159
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:53,669
Oh, yes! Oh yeah!
Shut!

160
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,512
I mean... If the castle is far and

161
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:58,671
Celulales phones are not covered...

162
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:02,084
Where there are nomadic or we freeze us
amid Transylvania, you know?

163
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:07,235
Do not want you...
- Maybe we can smoke marijuana.

164
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:08,887
Marijuana Damn!

165
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:12,318
Sure!
- It's been two.

166
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,361

167
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:17,394
I'm in.

168
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:20,587
Hey, what kind of food they serve there?

169
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,474
Greg, you eat everything.

170
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,818
Well, but I have a delicate palate
, okay?

171
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,259
I have to prepare my body for whatever
I go to eat.

172
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:29,657
Potatoes?

173
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,450
This girl never seen anything. - Hears!
- You move your ass on stage.

174
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:35,822
Guys?

175
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:37,365
Nena?

176
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:46,222
Okay, but only if there
water and electricity.

177
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:48,719
Yes, then we agree.

178
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,805
Let's do a damn time.
Let's do!

179
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:54,118
Yes! Let's do! Yes!
- Very good!

180
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Let's celebrate!

181
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,880
* Bottle... Bottle bottle *

182
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,076
Toast in plastic cups.
- Oh, hell.

183
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,509
Yes! - Yes very good!

184
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,456
What you are going to get in Romania?

185
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,618
Clothes, clothes. Only clothing.

186
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:12,648
If I do not know what we eat,
not you know you're going to wear.

187
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,742
Skirts. Only skirts and suits.

188
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:19,464
Toast! - Toast!

189
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,693
Transylvania! - Transylvania!

190
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,748
! I feel...!
I feel this...!

191
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,173
Stinks.

192
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,197
No we do more than complain
since we left LA

193
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,765
"The last 48 hours...

194
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,121
this was not the case last year"

195
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,603
You're bothering, Traci!
Stop talking!

196
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,630
Are you trying to get back all crazy?

197
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:40,631
Why not?

198
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,927
I have not seen you've rented a car
.

199
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,706
I told them you can not go to the castle by car
.

200
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:47,436
Besides, this is true.

201
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:48,437
Authentic?

202
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:49,857
Yes.

203
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:51,156
This is true.

204
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,603
The only way to Transylvania.

205
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,717
The real castle is great.
There's just some "failures".

206
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:58,524
Wait, "failure"?

207
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,708
Yes, "failures".

208
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,101
Do you want to explain?

209
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,392
No electricity, no.

210
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,611
Finally
only you find a "safe".

211
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,471
That was my only request!

212
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:14,008
I need electricity!

213
00:14:14,884 --> 00:14:17,044
I did not tell the truth because
maybe you would not have come.

214
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,813
So, sorry.

215
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,778
I feel so miserable.

216
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,309
There have another misarable!

217
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:33,800
Damn, man.

218
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,926
A phone with an international plan and a unit
3 gigs and it's a piece of shit.

219
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:40,425
Oh, my God.

220
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:43,773
Missing  5 for end party
week and "Puff"

221
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:44,829
Really?

222
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,377
Perhaps in the city does not allow us that.
It does not always mean that.

223
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,175
's Fine with me do the right thing.

224
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:53,096
Sorry, Do you mind if I have
a couple of ladies?

225
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:55,603
Can you tell me the difference between
"pomp" or "soleto"?

226
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:56,704
I can not.

227
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:59,943
This couple of girls took me fifteen hundred dollars
by this weekend...

228
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,165
And I just have this opportunity.

229
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,923
And if  "Pomp" or whatever,
"redneck", it cost me money.

230
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:08,285
Cost me money, blah, blah!
Give me the shoe, blah, blah, blah!

231
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,559
Oh, take it or not.

232
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:13,392
Ah, how do you manage to climb up there as a
pomper?

233
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:17,483
I climbed up here with dexterity, agility and much
Carazon.

234
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,053
Stay there, I'll work on that.

235
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,091
And you need a ladder to get down?
- Than?

236
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,655
Do you need a ladder?
- I do not need a ladder!

237
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,616
You need a ladder.
- I need power and courage.

238
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,334
A little slut with a lot of courage.
I'll be fine.

239
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,537
Dominic.

240
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,002
What now?

241
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:04,203
Please tell me you do not have to walk
anyway.

242
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,810
What am I doing here?

243
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,079
- "D"
- Yes

244
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:15,436
Can you...?

245
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:18,623
Can you keep it? It hurts me.
You'll have to change it for another size.

246
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:19,747
Okay.

247
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,368
Yes, sure.

248
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,982
Wait, uh...

249
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:29,616
I have a question.
- Yes

250
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,860
The dream you had,
How was the door?

251
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:40,260
It was a really big, with a corridor
almost could not enter size.

252
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,879
Why are we whispering?

253
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:48,542
I had the same dream on the train and
heard a woman calling my name.

254
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:50,435
Lie.

255
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:52,775
Really?
- Yes really.

256
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,254
I do not know, I do not say.

257
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,011
Greetings, greetings.

258
00:16:58,522 --> 00:16:59,665
I believe you are the guide.

259
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,267
Yes, you can call me André.

260
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:05,045
Where is your car?
- Where is the car? - I do not have a car.

261
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:07,893
I told them we can not go by car, is a short walk
.

262
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,452
She arrived two hours late.
- I'm sorry.

263
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,899
Half now and half when we get
. - It's okay.

264
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:19,232
Okay, follow me.

265
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,708
Are they kidding?

266
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,117
Oh, "D"!

267
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,806
She is under... - You okay.
- Under Jack.

268
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:00,380
Be careful there with the ground.

269
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:03,760
Tell me something new, my friend.

270
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,227
Aww! Damn!

271
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:11,754
Oh, look, we're moving forward.

272
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,084
Unbelievable.

273
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,118
I mean....

274
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:38,817
It's nice. It is somewhat rustic.

275
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,317
Money. - Than?

276
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,717
Money.

277
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,109
What? Do you think leave us here?

278
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,494
This bag has enough food for two days.

279
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,531
I turned, I'm going now.

280
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:51,437
The keys have the staff?

281
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,049
Keys? -Yes.
- Keys.

282
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,654
Money, money.

283
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,125
Good luck.

284
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,013
Beware, strange!

285
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,758
I like it, it's... Charming.

286
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:15,640
Why do you have the keys?

287
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,912
Okay. Boys and girls...
final surprise for me...

288
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,023
The castle will all our
for a week.

289
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,330
What ?!

290
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,545
Wait, you're going to be here at the Castle Dracula
ourselves?

291
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:30,193
That's right.

292
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,333
What ?!
- Okay...

293
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,833
I understand that this is not a five-star hotel
...

294
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:38,673
But at least I expected a star
for food and basic needs.

295
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:38,905
Yes.

296
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:42,352
Yes, Adam, she will need to give him back every
cents per day here...

297
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:43,805
Now what you gonna do?

298
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:47,924
Only... Enjoy the holidays.
Are you okay, please?

299
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,651
Yes, but it is closed.
- Let's do.

300
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,495
Food  Do you have food?

301
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:54,148
Come on, come on.

302
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:56,471
This is not for everyone.
- At the castle.

303
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:07,026
Oh, it looks good.

304
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,823
Oh, my God. Nothing shows.

305
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,248
I not see the entrance.

306
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,137
Keys, man!
Come on!

307
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:29,038
Come on, open the door!
Open the door!

308
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,539
Hold on, folks!

309
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:34,985
Jesus!

310
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,507
Who are you?

311
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:38,943
Veronica.

312
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:40,415
You must be Adam?

313
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,846
No, no, no.
It not supposed to have anyone in the castle.

314
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,172
André, the man who brought the leaves
I scare everyone he brings here.

315
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:50,914
This does not happen often.

316
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:52,699
What the hell is going on here?

317
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,761
This is an old castle...

318
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,301
And as you can see the gate works.

319
00:20:58,441 --> 00:20:59,970
Now is an old gate.

320
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:02,146
Who are you exactly?

321
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:07,766
Veronica, that I said.

322
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:11,586
I have been looking after the castle
since she was a child.

323
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,487
I'll take care of you while you're here
.

324
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:18,142
Now, if you have questions
I'll show you your rooms.

325
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,094
Yes. Yes, show us.

326
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:29,044
I almost shit scare.

327
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,033
Oh, God.
This is fucking amazing!

328
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:40,329
Oh?

329
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,766
Did not I tell you?

330
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,642
This is ridiculous!

331
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,685
I can not find a plug
anywhere.

332
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,230
It Is that really there is no electricity here, baby.

333
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,708
There are candles and chandeliers everywhere.

334
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,986
I can not live like this, okay?

335
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:04,574
I mean
my hair is delicate and needs treatment.

336
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,760
Do you really this is a joke?

337
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:10,362
What about the gruesome
lady of this castle?

338
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,099
"She's old."

339
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:14,981
"I will pretenderte where you're"

340
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:16,747
Maybe she intended us...

341
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,526
O pretenderte she wants you.

342
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,461
Why pretenderte if she is...
- Baby...

343
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:23,336
"That we shall you live" Come on!

344
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,307
Look, I love you, but you're being ridiculous here
.

345
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,267
Sorry.

346
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:35,298
I think you're not interested in that.

347
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:04,942
Nena. - Nene.
- Hello.

348
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,417
Wait...

349
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:23,344
Do you understand that all I did was turn
through the castle?

350
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:26,862
Well, a castle would be good.

351
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,162
Or a mansion.

352
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:33,900
O
any bigger than your condo thing.

353
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:35,399
Okay.

354
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,971
Well... You're wrong wrong.

355
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:41,244
This Weekend.

356
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,388
This time I was with you.
- Yes? - Yeah

357
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,458
Is it okay?
- Yes

358
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:06,922
Do not.

359
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,803
I promise, I will not be long.

360
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,484
All you have to do is move my finger
and make money.

361
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,713
I promise it will only take me two seconds and return
...

362
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:19,990
You know? Do not worry, maybe
not want to play again!

363
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,409
Wait...

364
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:24,386
Oh, my God!

365
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,307
Hey! Where is she going?

366
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:36,449
I do not know.

367
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,790
Okay...

368
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:41,592
Did she tell you not to do
calls in the room?

369
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:44,281
No, I do not know, no.
Not really.

370
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:47,774
We're going to explore the other
rooms Want to join us?

371
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,473
No, you have fun.
I will stay here.

372
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,397
Charming as ever.

373
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:07,035
Look...

374
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:09,876
Warning, terrifying room.

375
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:17,130
Well, at least it is
has some nice and small...

376
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:41,557
Is not this supposed to be historic?

377
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:51,659
Dom?

378
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:56,867
Are you coming?

379
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,616
Linda!
My class room!

380
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,414
How is
marvel has lasted so long?

381
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:18,143
It looks old.

382
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:44,789
Dominic?

383
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:48,409
Stop!
- What was that?

384
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:50,295
What are you doing?
Stop!

385
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,029
Really? -¡Levy!
- Where are you?

386
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:55,102
Boys!

387
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:58,314
What the hell are you doing?
Go away!

388
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:00,668
Okay! Stop!
- It is not a big thing!

389
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:02,602
Are you okay?
- "Lev", are you okay?

390
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:04,218
I'm great, how are you?

391
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,538
This piece of shit
ate all our food!

392
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,299
Jesus... - What the hell, Greg?

393
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,578
The basic thing is that we have no food
to start, thanks for that.

394
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:11,989
Look, everything is fine.

395
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,638
We eat tonight and tomorrow
go for more. Who cares?

396
00:27:16,257 --> 00:27:17,257
Really?

397
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:18,056
Look...

398
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,853
I'm hypoglycemic it, okay?

399
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:22,767
If I have my calories, I'm in shock.
You. They understand that?

400
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:24,612
Mm-Mm.

401
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:25,986
Jesus!

402
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,746
It Is that nobody can stand
without scaring people?

403
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:30,661
Dinner is ready.

404
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:33,942
I would take my food bag,
before your fat friend's find.

405
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,187
They see it was no big deal...

406
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:38,681
Well, you can eat all they want on
is splendid evening.

407
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:40,842
Now if you are ready, follow me.

408
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:43,277
Do you think "Porky"?
Caricature Damn!

409
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:44,852
Commits a penis, Adam!

410
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:47,263
Even if there is danger.

411
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:48,835
Do you want to stop that, guys?

412
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,689
We're just going to eat something fresh.

413
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:52,407
Are you sure?
- Yes

414
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:56,909
This is a bit romantic.

415
00:27:57,284 --> 00:28:01,106
're Stuck in this horrible
castle, but with these candles, the moon.

416
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:03,902
The dinner was quite good.

417
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,709
Everything was delicious.
Thank you, Veronica.

418
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,579
Oh, after this meal.

419
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,350
This line is a killer.

420
00:28:15,053 --> 00:28:16,347
This is very old.

421
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:19,711
Veronica, what do you know about things
Dracula?

422
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,033
His real name was "Vlad the 3rd"

423
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:28,498
Was a powerful ruler, who saved
this nation for many years.

424
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,434
About his brutal tendencies?

425
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,087
All these are stories to scare children
.

426
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:38,986
Like this... "The legend of Count Dracula."

427
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:41,534
Some pieces.

428
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:43,317
It was not a magician.

429
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:52,143
Seriously, folks, as in real history behind
is a king, a vampire, you know?

430
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,201
He died.

431
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:56,397
That's all.

432
00:28:59,228 --> 00:29:00,228
Okay.

433
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:03,869
Speaking of all, I found this book in the old bookstore
...

434
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,555
And I think that is the diary of Vlad,
but I want to do a translation.

435
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,012
This is a very important book.

436
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:16,012
This is the story of
"The Order of the Dragon"

437
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:18,473
Where Prince Vlad was a member.

438
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,749
If you let me read it, we
to be in a more comfortable place.

439
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:25,939
Very good place.

440
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:28,699
Better than a tent in the mountains.

441
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,145
Well, it's not a school year
we can dodge, but...

442
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:33,968
Learn old things... - Yes!

443
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:35,897
All the old things.

444
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:37,365
Ancient  * *

445
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:39,882
I have not had a damn signal
all night.

446
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:45,888
Oh my God, he thinks, are in the midst
Romania, in the castle of a friend...

447
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:48,567
So please,
Do you want to leave the phone for a second?

448
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:50,870
I know I'm in the middle of Romania
with my friends, but...

449
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:54,721
I need this second
and I hope that you understand that for a second...

450
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:59,513
Malditas apologies! I understand
bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla.

451
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,679
Come on, guys!
Do you want to shut up for a second?

452
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:03,728
Just for a second, come on!
Please continue!

453
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:07,530
This is the story of
"Sociestas Draconi tarragon"

454
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:11,458
Who its seal symbolizes the sacrifices

455
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,924
Night
who changed his life for another life.

456
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:21,469
In ancient Valagia regions, are mentioned
Count words...

457
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:26,514
And faced with his whole being
against the enemies of his empire.

458
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:30,976
The prince Vlad did...
- Wait! Shit, sorry, I'll shut up.

459
00:30:31,254 --> 00:30:33,784
Adam!
- I'm sorry, it's fascinating!

460
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:36,627
Oh, my God!
It's good, really, but...

461
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:40,881
What we really want to hear is about... How
of Vlad Dracula became?

462
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,442
You are so gross!
I apologize!

463
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:43,868
Am I right, Greg?

464
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:45,755
I'm with him.
- In fact, I'm with him.

465
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,866
You should apologize for being so stupid
for that!

466
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:57,499
Only two moons in the third reign, the

467
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:00,889
Prince Vlad
returned home after the battle...

468
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:04,634
And found his castle surrounded
Turkish soldiers ejécito.

469
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:08,333
The castle was all full of red
blood of his servants...

470
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:10,924
Soldiers and their families.

471
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,984
I invoke, master of darkness.

472
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:46,454
I renounce the one true God.

473
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,303
My soul for her life.

474
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:54,690
My soul to death.

475
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:59,368
You shall offer me a soul longing...

476
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:04,520
For a soul to be tortured...

477
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:08,712
The circle of the seven
demons for eternity?

478
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,132
She lives. They die.
That's the covenant.

479
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,543
Is done.

480
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,695
Drink the blood of your enemy.

481
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,030
Do you hear?
The death of your brothers?

482
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:56,733
Not even your master may
break our defenses!

483
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:01,476
No one will see you cringe when you feel fear!

484
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,474
My lord...

485
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:12,633
You arrived.

486
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,353
No!

487
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:25,183
No!

488
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:26,566
No!

489
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,096
What did I do to deserve this?

490
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:12,915
You promised!

491
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,874
The pact!

492
00:34:27,352 --> 00:34:28,352
My beloved...

493
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:29,735
My lord!

494
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:43,150
Take this, my love!

495
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:46,378
Back...

496
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:49,346
On the day of the wolf!

497
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:51,559
Prepare the way!

498
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:05,933
Oh, God!

499
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,395
Fucking bastard!
Jesus, Adam!

500
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:10,259
Is that all?
Is that the whole story?

501
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:11,787
Yes.

502
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:13,786
The rest of the pages are blank
.

503
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:17,189
All I could say
Elisabeta of this castle.

504
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:20,633
You.
Heard the last writings of "The Order of the Dragon"

505
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,319
So I do not think this book
how historic.

506
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,150
I'll go get a glass of water.

507
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:41,411
I'll walk, not good
walk by these walls at night, alone.

508
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:51,987
You are different from your friends.

509
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:18,448
Wake.

510
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:20,367
Wake.

511
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:26,307
What, what?
That beautiful?

512
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:26,813
Yes.

513
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:29,871
She spoke of children who cut her throat
...

514
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:32,976
People who sell their souls and people
twist their necks.

515
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:35,258
What's so beautiful?
What are beautiful that?

516
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:37,504
Oh, my God!
Of course, it had to be Greg!

517
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,266
Yes! You or you!

518
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:43,045
He loved her more than you can protect us
.

519
00:36:43,377 --> 00:36:44,377
Hello!

520
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:48,025
Hey, you fell, but do not hurt yourself.

521
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:52,654
Here, drink a glass of water.
- I'm not well.

522
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:55,945
In fact I...

523
00:36:58,647 --> 00:36:59,846
Were completed.
Oh man.

524
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,655
There a doctor in the village.
I can take him tomorrow.

525
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:05,277
Thanks.

526
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:09,601
I'm sorry for that.

527
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,376
That happens to me sometimes.

528
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:16,563
Well, strange people.

529
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:17,564
Me too.

530
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:21,151
No. You do not want to dig
is aptitid beautifully, you are not like them...

531
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:23,761
Because someone will reap in the way Greg decides.

532
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:26,378
Thanks.

533
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:31,077
She will help me with my "door"
Did you see?

534
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,429
Well, I'm tired all tonight.

535
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:40,517
What's wrong?

536
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,552
No one will leave the castle walls.

537
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:47,721
Wolves have very poor fitness
here.

538
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:55,646
Well, if you need someone to protect
, tell me and go to your room.

539
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,159
Okay, "Casanova".

540
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,064
Do you really think move out here, Adam?

541
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:01,125
Why... - Good evening everyone.

542
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:03,458
Good night!
- Good night, Veronica!

543
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:04,950
This type still hungry!

544
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:06,837
So I do something about it.

545
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:07,887
Now is not food.

546
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,380
No matter, find her!

547
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:15,381
What the fuck, man?

548
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:21,492
What?

549
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:22,905
It's just...

550
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:25,181
I can not receive any signal
of this piece of crap and...

551
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:27,668
Put that damn thing, sit back and enjoy

552
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,233
Of the evening for two seconds
damn, man!

553
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:31,283
I will do this.

554
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,362
Sit down or get out of here!

555
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:34,684
One or the other?

556
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:36,428
Okay, I'll go.

557
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:39,180
Really?

558
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:40,960
Are you kidding?
- Do not!

559
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:45,101
Sorry guys, I ask
apologize for this...

560
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:47,243
Bastard!
I think I better go to bed.

561
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,535
Yes. Would you also go?

562
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:29,603
Can I ask you a question?

563
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:31,585
Security.

564
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:34,374
Why it takes so long to go to fetch water
?

565
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,018
I got lost and I fainted.

566
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,723
How Veronica right there?
- If, with Veronica there!

567
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,578
I do not know what you're thinking, but you know better
all about me!

568
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,012
I just...

569
00:40:49,543 --> 00:40:51,543
It really annoys me with those feelings.

570
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:55,278
Some places are just strange.

571
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:58,207
Is probably something in the castle.

572
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:00,372
Perhaps.

573
00:41:01,278 --> 00:41:04,489
I just checked that Greg is not in his room
and neither is Sean.

574
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,348
Well, maybe...

575
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:09,935
Greg is with Veronica.

576
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:12,405
Perhaps he will become the king of Romania
.

577
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,018
What about Sean?

578
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:18,507
In dogs landfill.

579
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,113
You heard what he said about Veronica
walking alone in the castle. - Y?

580
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,406
I can not get these hunches.

581
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:29,850
'll Go with Adam to find Greg.
I only take five minutes.

582
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:32,771
If we do not find that insurance is
you must be smoking somewhere.

583
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:34,030
Nene...

584
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:36,033
Who cares if
're on vacation?

585
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:38,102
Why do not you go back to bed and enjoy
?

586
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:39,585
Five minutes.

587
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:41,683
Back.
I will return quickly.

588
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:44,197
Good.

589
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,114
Go.

590
00:42:05,712 --> 00:42:06,412
Hi, guys!

591
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,079
Hello!
What's up?

592
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:10,556
Sean and Greg have not returned.

593
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,462
Yes, what's your point?

594
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:15,720
Sure you do not want to go for them?

595
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:19,206
"D" is that you're not getting anything,
but I have things to do...

596
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,102
And things to do.

597
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,624
We will only be five minutes.

598
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:29,647
I'm sorry, baby.
I'll take that hot bath and I'll be ready for when you return.

599
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:33,687
You scum "D"

600
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:36,290
You make my temperature rise, friend.

601
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,195
Let  "D"!
Do not make jokes!

602
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:42,363
You know what?
You do not always have to be a complete bastard.

603
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:46,955
Why did you take my personal choices?
- I'm sorry, okay ?, he did not know.

604
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:51,637
I'm going to start now. Also I will look
those two "stunned" by the castle.

605
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,241
Know estuvistes nervous before, but this sucks...

606
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,401
I will work and...

607
00:42:58,002 --> 00:43:00,405
Adam, there are other things in life!
- Oh, what?

608
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:05,898
Okay. But we split.

609
00:43:06,412 --> 00:43:08,315
You go to the left and to the right
.

610
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:09,936
Yes, sure.

611
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:13,264
And when you finish
'll go right to bed!

612
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:42,401
God, you scared me.
- I'm sorry.

613
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:46,507
Just I spent to know how you are.

614
00:43:47,942 --> 00:43:50,834
I just... I'm not tired, you know?

615
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:56,051
Sean has nothing mental,
you only interested in "i phone" or "i pad"

616
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,919
O bets, something immature.

617
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:04,412
Do I always have to be
knees? Always?

618
00:44:05,956 --> 00:44:08,100
It must be very frustrating
be his girlfriend.

619
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:09,327
Yes, well...

620
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:12,737
I Am seeking love and have it in my hands
.

621
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:14,920
That kills me, I need that.

622
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:19,018
See the example that Ashley has
all the time. - Oh, hot water.

623
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:21,821
You can go to all places, shopping...

624
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:29,859
Every single thing they have friends
I... I have with Sean.

625
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:33,174
It could be worse.

626
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:34,980
Really? What would that be like?

627
00:44:35,762 --> 00:44:38,105
You could be with Greg.
- Oh God.

628
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:42,748
What time is smiling and love.

629
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,016
I really wish I were dead.

630
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:53,084
If you could change one thing...
Would you?

631
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:55,949
I...

632
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:57,933
I think you know.

633
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:26,853
Adam?

634
00:45:40,468 --> 00:45:42,516
Adam, get out.

635
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:05,247
Guys?

636
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:12,659
Damn!

637
00:46:14,453 --> 00:46:15,453
Hey!

638
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:16,669
Hey!

639
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:33,300
What happens to that child?

640
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,593
Hi, Sean.

641
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:37,231
He likes to watch the well
castle.

642
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:41,629
Well, he took my mobile phone and I
I would like it back, please

643
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:44,876
You took something that belongs to him?

644
00:46:45,231 --> 00:46:46,776
It's a wonder he wanted to see.

645
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:51,559
Well, that's steal if you ask me.
You need to return.

646
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:53,329
But... - Now!

647
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,734
Here.

648
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:56,847
Oh, what...?

649
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,896
Putting your life and your faith in a machine
how that only you become more vague!

650
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,266
! Just stop!
This is not a game!

651
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:02,093
Oh, what the hell?

652
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:05,034
Not wont be a vague
with the being that you love!

653
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:07,770
Demon disappears.

654
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,841
You and Ashley are the only ones who have not seen their parents
a month.

655
00:47:18,575 --> 00:47:20,964
I have several tricks it is
week if that's what you mean.

656
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:23,515
Yes, it would be amazing.

657
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,472
What will you do when you let Sean?

658
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,740
I have to fix some things.

659
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:31,474
Security.

660
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,332
She is sleeping.

661
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:38,703
This will be our secret, okay?

662
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:23,715
Whao!

663
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,532
That is very old.

664
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:51,835
Oh... I'm sorry.
Really do not want...

665
00:48:51,836 --> 00:48:54,381
Losing yourself in my quarters?
- Yes.

666
00:48:56,435 --> 00:49:00,147
They belong to Prince Vlad.
You look like him a little.

667
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:03,228
Or maybe you llegastes to restore
history?

668
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:06,843
You can touch me if you want.

669
00:49:07,438 --> 00:49:10,092
I... I'm fine. Thank you.

670
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,612
Well, I'm looking for Sean and Greg.

671
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:18,053
The big guy and the little guy.

672
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:19,893
Have you seen them?

673
00:49:21,202 --> 00:49:24,492
But if I do, I'll let you know.

674
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:26,908
Are you sure you
no friends left?

675
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:29,827
No, I think they are
locked and secure.

676
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:33,395
Thanks.

677
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,540
What is happening?

678
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:55,517
I do not want to be here anymore.
Than?

679
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,810
True... Ghosts.

680
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,618
Something in the bathroom.

681
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,624
Ghosts?
Does that mean?

682
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:05,046
I do not care if you believe me or not, but I want to go...
now.

683
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,374
Baby, can not leave here.

684
00:50:07,624 --> 00:50:08,935
Did not you hear what Veronica said?

685
00:50:09,295 --> 00:50:11,383
There are wolves out and are very dangerous.

686
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:12,475
No.

687
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:14,989
Look, I'll stay with you all night...

688
00:50:15,386 --> 00:50:18,717
And when we are safe by
talk tomorrow, okay?

689
00:50:19,278 --> 00:50:20,278
Good.

690
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,464
Well, since you officially started
this before now...

691
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:33,061
Sorry.

692
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:44,669
Hello. - Hello.

693
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,907
I'm sorry I upset before.

694
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:49,334
Okay.

695
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:08,753
Dom?

696
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:15,778
Are you okay?

697
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,687
Dom, if you walked through the front
someone is here.

698
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:21,462
What?

699
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:25,033
But if I was just looking
boys.

700
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:28,470
Was it you?

701
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:30,835
Yes, relax.

702
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:33,024
You had said that he would look for.

703
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:35,941
I do not like this place, Dom

704
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:39,890
There are voices everywhere
then that bitch is behind you.

705
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:44,096
I can not stay here a week.

706
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,109
Are you okay?

707
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:52,055
Yes, it's just...

708
00:51:53,008 --> 00:51:55,703
Is the feeling that began to be stronger
...

709
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:58,001
About this place and about
the castle.

710
00:51:59,224 --> 00:52:01,562
Perhaps
talk to Adam to see the doctor tomorrow.

711
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:04,278
Do you know what he is prone to bouts?

712
00:52:05,776 --> 00:52:07,336
You are the one who have to talk.

713
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:12,658
True, you have to sleep.

714
00:52:49,185 --> 00:52:50,297
It's time.

715
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:57,299
It's time, my lord.

716
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:15,851
What is that?

717
00:53:17,351 --> 00:53:18,441
You gotta see this.

718
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,412
Oh, my God!

719
00:53:29,133 --> 00:53:30,613
It looks like Veronica!

720
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:32,398
What the...?

721
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:36,667
It is dated 1476 A.D.
- But all we saw it, right?

722
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:39,995
I mean she's going to be more irrelevant
afternoon some way, but...

723
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:41,996
This place is weird
must get out of here now!

724
00:53:42,196 --> 00:53:43,400
Someone seen Sean?

725
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,238
He was sleeping with me last night,
but I woke up this morning and...

726
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,000
I do not know, he just was not, perhaps
I have to guess that was!

727
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:50,622
You have the phone with you, right?

728
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:51,690
Yes, but I have to look.

729
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:53,311
How about you?
- Do not! I looked everywhere!

730
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:55,544
What about Greg?

731
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,004
Damn... Greg !

732
00:54:01,749 --> 00:54:03,013
He's not in here!

733
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:07,105
Okay, I'll finally listen to that creepy
book...

734
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:08,679
We go.

735
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:10,294
Oh, guys!

736
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:13,288
It is the same that is in the book!

737
00:54:13,748 --> 00:54:15,188
It's exactly like her!

738
00:54:15,704 --> 00:54:17,873
We have to find her and ask her.

739
00:54:18,118 --> 00:54:19,438
Maybe she saw Sean and Greg.

740
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:20,773
How will you find it?

741
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,193
I know where your room is.
- Than?

742
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:25,707
Hey, look, I was in his quarters
looking guys, okay?

743
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:28,948
I had not said anything because I knew you were going to discuss
no reason at me!

744
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:32,137
We have much bigger than solve problems, are you okay ?!

745
00:54:36,545 --> 00:54:39,772
No! This can not be right!
This is exactly the door!

746
00:54:40,242 --> 00:54:42,118
"D" What's going on?
Why did you lie to us?

747
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,514
I'm not lying! I swear to God!
I was here!

748
00:54:45,207 --> 00:54:46,207
Why you hide it?

749
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,362
I'm not hiding anything, I promise.

750
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:05,835
No!

751
00:55:06,926 --> 00:55:07,994
No!

752
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,132
Off me, dammit!

753
00:55:13,574 --> 00:55:15,219
Oh, God!
- Quiet.

754
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:19,097
I'm sorry!
I am so sorry!

755
00:55:19,768 --> 00:55:22,141
Oh, my God!
He died!

756
00:55:23,095 --> 00:55:25,053
Guys, let's go now.

757
00:55:25,054 --> 00:55:27,174
We have to call the police and seek
phone!

758
00:55:27,332 --> 00:55:30,015
The phone has no signal!
Let's go from here!

759
00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:35,392
Whoever did this has to be by

760
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:37,205
Surroundings.
So let's go from here.

761
00:55:37,206 --> 00:55:39,739
Maybe he shut up!
Veronica told us ..!

762
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,849
You can not believe it!

763
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:43,682
Sean is dead!

764
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:49,106
Sean was right, there is something wrong
in this castle! I've seen things!

765
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:52,104
I saw them in the bathroom!

766
00:55:52,454 --> 00:55:54,214
I... You have to make a decision
okay?

767
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,106
We seek to Greg and we go from here.

768
00:55:57,328 --> 00:55:59,123
But we have to leave the body
here, right?

769
00:55:59,124 --> 00:56:01,285
Okay guys, we go now!
Let's go!

770
00:56:02,003 --> 00:56:03,057
What about Greg?

771
00:56:03,268 --> 00:56:05,348
I do not know, I searched the kitchen
and he was not there!

772
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:07,129
Is that the only place that you sought?

773
00:56:07,455 --> 00:56:08,855
What you believe what buscastes at all?

774
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:10,878
What do you say?
What I care a shit?

775
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:14,562
Not the damn time to fight!
We have to get out of here!

776
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:20,459
Come here! I'm sorry!
We leave it, okay ?!

777
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,910
Greg!
- Greg!

778
00:56:28,226 --> 00:56:29,226
Greg!

779
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Greg!

780
00:56:32,528 --> 00:56:33,827
Where is he?

781
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:36,089
Greg!

782
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:37,476
Guys, wait!

783
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,530
"D"?

784
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:17,021
"D"!

785
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:19,633
What's up, man?

786
00:57:21,129 --> 00:57:23,384
He's...

787
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,600
Just close your eyes when
go through the tunnel!

788
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:31,846
What is happening?

789
00:57:33,294 --> 00:57:34,900
What is happening?

790
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:48,579
We must get out of this bloody trail.

791
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:50,171
I know.

792
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:52,404
Just a second.

793
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:55,067
I'm sorry, guys.
This is all my fault.

794
00:57:55,068 --> 00:57:56,502
Adam... - Do not say that.

795
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:58,597
No, no, it's not.
It's not your fault.

796
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:02,542
Your traiste us here, but not your fault
. Only vamonos.

797
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:05,316
I...

798
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:06,719
I remember this hill.

799
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:11,193
From where you are until this tree
three similar trees.

800
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:15,862
So we will continue down the road, descend
and try to get help.

801
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:17,343
Is it okay?
- It's okay.

802
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,696
How important is it?

803
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:20,551
Guys, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

804
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,204
You'll see how
back to the United States. Come on.

805
00:58:23,844 --> 00:58:24,925
We can achieve this.

806
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:28,007
Guys, this is!
This is the clear!

807
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:30,767
No, no, no, no no!
But what...?

808
00:58:31,363 --> 00:58:33,529
What the...?
We went down the hill, right ?!

809
00:58:33,982 --> 00:58:35,152
We walked down the hill!

810
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:38,255
We follow the path and down the damn hill
, right ?!

811
00:58:38,256 --> 00:58:39,729
Look guys, try something!
I mean...!

812
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:41,698
Look! Look! Look!

813
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:43,947
We will mark the trees with this!

814
00:58:44,835 --> 00:58:46,159
Do our own path!

815
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:48,035
That you show us the way out,
okay?

816
00:58:48,036 --> 00:58:50,490
So let's go.
Come on, follow me.

817
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,357
This is the hill, right?

818
00:59:13,205 --> 00:59:14,540
This is!
So...

819
00:59:15,169 --> 00:59:16,649
We went in that direction.

820
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,833
We not want to go over there.

821
00:59:19,314 --> 00:59:20,794
We have to go this way here.

822
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,357
Take this step and take this damn road.

823
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:41,266
Come on, almost there.

824
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:46,224
No, no, wait...
What the...?

825
00:59:57,674 --> 00:59:59,248
What we will achieve.
We are going to achieve.

826
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:00,854
All of this was my fault!

827
01:00:00,855 --> 01:00:04,165
If only I'd been more patient!
I do not know!

828
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,821
Levy, Levy.
It's not your fault.

829
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Do not touch me...

830
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,341
Do not touch me!

831
01:00:11,593 --> 01:00:13,119
Do not touch me!

832
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:16,148
You're right!
Was not our fault...

833
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,704
It was because of you!

834
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:19,800
Your traiste us here!

835
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:22,404
You killed Greg!
You killed my boyfriend!

836
01:00:23,682 --> 01:00:25,904
I wanted something new!
I wanted something different...

837
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:29,053
And I thought you were going to give me!
But you want to kill us all!

838
01:00:29,563 --> 01:00:31,392
Levy, Levy, listen...

839
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:37,166
I really feel about what happened to him
Greg and Sean, but do not blame Adam...

840
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,365
He just does what he can.

841
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:43,065
Oh! You do not know everything about him!
What do you know?

842
01:00:43,483 --> 01:00:44,536
Taking gifts from him?

843
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:49,052
To you do not give a shit about Ashley
Because you're a damn "bulldozer"

844
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:52,403
You know what, Levy?
Fuck!

845
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:55,473
Guys, if she wants to stay here
Leave her alone!

846
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:57,750
I cared about Sean!

847
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,777
I loved him!

848
01:00:59,778 --> 01:01:02,245
You do not deserve to Adam!
You do not deserve someone like him!

849
01:01:02,716 --> 01:01:03,716
Is why...

850
01:01:04,403 --> 01:01:07,544
When he was not with you...
He came towards me.

851
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:11,472
What is she talking about?

852
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:12,739
True.

853
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:16,589
When we had a good  "fucking"...
He came towards me.

854
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,410
What is she talking about?

855
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:25,512
I'm talking about your boyfriend is me
"fucking" to me several weeks ago!

856
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:27,515
Why will not you interesas him shit!

857
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:30,818
What was that?

858
01:01:33,044 --> 01:01:33,511
Oh my God!

859
01:01:33,797 --> 01:01:34,797
Fuck.

860
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:36,898
Fuck.

861
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:55,835
What the...?
What happened?

862
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:03,597
Guys, we need to return to the castle!

863
01:02:04,126 --> 01:02:06,352
I will not return to the bloody castle!

864
01:02:06,586 --> 01:02:07,986
Are you going to stay here with the wolves?

865
01:02:08,245 --> 01:02:09,970
They smell blood!
We have no choice!

866
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:12,354
We gotta get the hell out!

867
01:02:12,408 --> 01:02:13,408
We have to go!

868
01:02:22,461 --> 01:02:23,726
I'm so tired.

869
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,561
I have to keep my eyes open.

870
01:02:29,924 --> 01:02:31,324
I have hunger.

871
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:37,443
I just want to sleep,
but can not.

872
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:44,152
Keep them open, but I will try to manternerlos yourself

873
01:02:45,923 --> 01:02:49,117
We joking
on this piece of trash.

874
01:02:54,114 --> 01:02:55,592
I just want to leave here.

875
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,072
Rose, shut up!

876
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:02,140
You have no right to talk like that.
- Just calm down.

877
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:07,518
You were "fucking"
that bitch while your two best friends were killed!

878
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,805
Now you feel fear?

879
01:03:10,304 --> 01:03:12,301
Do not I'll say it again!
Stop talking!

880
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:13,774
I will not stop talking!

881
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:16,339
Is that what you wanted?
What were not Greg and Sean?

882
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:18,573
I will not believe anything you say.

883
01:03:19,414 --> 01:03:22,862
You are a "bloodsucking whore"
Did you know?

884
01:03:23,753 --> 01:03:26,000
You just you spent my money!
That's all you did!

885
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,934
In this scenario!
In the whole planet earth!

886
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:31,923
Would you suck the life to anyone!
And why? Huh?

887
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:33,514
Did you expect a special life?

888
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:37,178
You're just a
"problematic and wealthy whore"!

889
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:38,179
Muerete...

890
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:41,860

pathetic piece of shit!

891
01:03:42,158 --> 01:03:43,386
Ashley!
- Than?

892
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:45,771
We have to stay together!
- I do not care!

893
01:03:45,804 --> 01:03:51,063
Rather risk that one has outside
be here another minute with this idiot!

894
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:54,144
My chances!
Current take me! - Jesus!

895
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:57,500
Stay here!
I'll bring it back!

896
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,101
Sometimes become idiots!
- Dom!

897
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:05,082
Do not worry, I'll protect you.

898
01:04:06,018 --> 01:04:08,157
Ashley, wait!
Ashley!

899
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:31,691
Why did you traistes here?

900
01:04:32,679 --> 01:04:35,156
Just I had the great idea to do something different
.

901
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:37,634
It was probably damn different.

902
01:04:40,993 --> 01:04:41,993
Why?

903
01:04:43,437 --> 01:04:45,496
Why here?
Did he tell you he wanted to go?

904
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:47,676
Will you give me a fucking night?

905
01:04:49,508 --> 01:04:52,398
Good. Like you say.

906
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,422
Are you still a virgin?
It is not like this?

907
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:06,003
What do you care?

908
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:07,485
I do not care.

909
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,020
Okay...

910
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:16,977
Are you sure you want to stay well?

911
01:05:17,677 --> 01:05:18,677
Excuse me?

912
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:22,594
No... I just said, you know?

913
01:05:23,198 --> 01:05:24,598
If you want to do so with "D"...

914
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:26,582
Why not do it with me?

915
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:38,336
We will all die
damn anyway!

916
01:05:39,563 --> 01:05:40,563
How important is it?

917
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,568
What fucking matter?
You have the fucking pleasure.

918
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:48,521
Stop.

919
01:05:49,388 --> 01:05:50,388
Oh, come on.

920
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,648
Stop.
- Look...

921
01:05:53,225 --> 01:05:55,099
Things do not matter
Ashley said, you know?

922
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,409
Stop.

923
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:58,812
Stop.
- Come on.

924
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:02,589
Stop!

925
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:03,681
Damn!

926
01:06:05,053 --> 01:06:06,613
Chelsea, come on!
I was just kidding!

927
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:19,112
It's time, my love.

928
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:24,853
It's time.

929
01:06:32,643 --> 01:06:34,049
Another sacrifice...

930
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:38,132
The invadilez not last long.

931
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,241
You will shine stronger than all.

932
01:06:43,552 --> 01:06:45,369
I waited for long.

933
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:48,336
Now I can touch you again, my lord.

934
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:50,416
I love you.

935
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:52,678
I love you.

936
01:07:08,454 --> 01:07:09,989
Last sacrifices.

937
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:12,533
Are you ready?

938
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:15,395
For four devils?

939
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,808
Your hunches be short.

940
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:20,289
I feel good, my lord.

941
01:07:20,888 --> 01:07:22,218
Okay.

01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:29,596
Oh, my love!

947
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,079

01:07:53,743 --> 01:07:55,382

Fuck you!

956
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:24,688

Let me go!

961
01:08:34,348 --> 01:08:35,778
Probably we will not do that.

962
01:08:37,368 --> 01:08:39,131
You will never leave!

963
01:08:40,393 --> 01:08:41,393
Let me go!

964
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:43,281
Do not make havoc!

965
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,822
The prince hates people
wreak havoc.

966
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:48,196
Do you know what he says?

967
01:08:49,373 --> 01:08:51,240
"When you find it do not let go"

968
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:54,439
"They can take everything you want your body
"

969
01:08:54,828 --> 01:08:55,828
I'm thirsty.

970
01:08:56,038 --> 01:08:58,439
We'll let completely dry.

971
01:08:58,683 --> 01:09:00,766

981
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,060
Chelsea!

982
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:48,160
You'd better stay away.

983
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:49,584
Look, we have to be united.

984
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:51,440
Lie!
Get away!

985
01:09:51,965 --> 01:09:56,476
Sorry, I do not know what I was thinking, is it
well? I did not know what he was doing.

986
01:09:56,707 --> 01:09:59,582
No! Only you wanted to rape me!

987
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,449
Chelsea, you're not safe!

988
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:06,619
Damn!

989
01:10:19,134 --> 01:10:20,324
Dom... What the...?

990
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,082
Yourself "broke" a son...

991
01:10:24,363 --> 01:10:27,237
And now you're on your way to hell
enough.

992
01:10:28,654 --> 01:10:31,200
Put your bones when you go!

993
01:10:59,499 --> 01:11:00,508
Chelsea?

994
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:05,132
Is Dominic.

995
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:08,138
Dom, oh yes, Dom.

996
01:11:13,851 --> 01:11:14,895
Why are you wet?

997
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:18,214
I know, I know.

998
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:25,194
Ashley was killed...

999
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:29,410
Why are you calm?

1000
01:11:31,712 --> 01:11:33,396
Please people...

1001
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,473
We're all friends.

1002
01:11:36,515 --> 01:11:37,942
I defected from the faith.

1003
01:11:40,168 --> 01:11:41,417
I know I'm different.

1004
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,074
We are pure.

1005
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:46,568
Dom?

1006
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:48,705
Stop, you're scaring me.

1007
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:51,891
Dom?

1008
01:13:39,388 --> 01:13:40,388
Dom?

1009
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:45,799
Why?

1010
01:13:46,513 --> 01:13:47,568
Why are you doing this?

1011
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:51,694
Poor girl...

1012
01:13:51,906 --> 01:13:56,023
Will die without understanding that life is seditious
boring.

1013
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,003
Dom... She is not real.

1014
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:05,768
This is exactly...
What she wants to do.

1015
01:14:06,605 --> 01:14:10,023
... This castle is controlling you, okay?

1016
01:14:10,525 --> 01:14:12,678
This is not real.
It's okay?

1017
01:14:13,551 --> 01:14:16,501
Do not make this harder than
what it will be.

1018
01:14:18,462 --> 01:14:20,025
You need to take the road.

1019
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:21,896
Dom...

1020
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:23,421
Dom...

1021
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:26,232
Dom!

1022
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:30,310
Why do you do it?
Why are you doing this to me?

1023
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:33,142
That's not you, Dom.

1024
01:14:39,746 --> 01:14:43,536
... Dom Dom, she is controlling you.

1025
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:46,031
Do not let her do it.

1026
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:51,467
! Sun! Dom! Dom!

1027
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:55,738
Okay, Dom...

1028
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:58,784
You love me.

1029
01:14:58,785 --> 01:14:59,785
Is it okay?

1030
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:01,735
Eligeme.

1031
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:03,079
No, my love!

1032
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:04,701
She does not love you.

1033
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:09,771
Our love is strong,
how the dark.

1034
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:14,038
I'm innocent!
I do not deserve to die!

1035
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:15,553
Innocent?

1036
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:20,001
Innocent? Being next to you
I could see things clearly.

1037
01:15:20,002 --> 01:15:21,541
No! What are you doing?

1038
01:15:22,444 --> 01:15:23,444
Now!

1039
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:29,657
Called  hell and the seven demons...

1040
01:15:30,842 --> 01:15:32,861
To come and be released.

1041
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:36,065
"Beelzebub" will be the first!

1042
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:39,528
The carnivorous demon!
Hungry and insatiable!

1043
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:43,333
The second will be "Belphagor"!
The demon of laziness!

1044
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:46,690
Who uses people to abide by


1045
01:15:46,702 --> 01:15:49,639
Him with the desires and responsibilities

1046
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:55,635
The third is "Leviathan"
- "Leviathan"!

1047
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,344
"The bastard" Bandi "whose heart was corrupt

..and became his brother's wife.

1050
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:11,408
" Mammon "

1051
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:14,190
Y is hoping to become someone better

1052
01:16:14,876 --> 01:16:19,079

And he was blinded by "Lucifer"

"Lucifer"

1057
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:38,205

Seven sacrifices by one.

1063
01:17:03,795 --> 01:17:07,418
Seven Sinners by one pure.

1064
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:10,562
Look at me, Dominic.

1065
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:12,314
Look at me...

01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,578
I'm Chelsea.

1067
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,727
Do you remember the nice things we did together
?

1068
01:17:18,728 --> 01:17:20,314
And when you gave me the ring?

1069
01:17:22,462 --> 01:17:23,462
Look at me...

1070
01:17:24,582 --> 01:17:26,524
In this "day of the wolf"...

1071
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:30,676
All demons arise all over the earth...

1072
01:17:31,016 --> 01:17:33,646
To reduce it to ashes again.

1073
01:17:34,661 --> 01:17:36,993
I invoke, "Lucifer"!

1074
01:17:37,706 --> 01:17:41,590
Invocandote  I die, "Diablo"
my master.

1075
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,256
You know me...

1076
01:17:45,738 --> 01:17:47,427
It's me, Chelsea.

1077
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,639
Remember, remember...

1078
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:50,941
My love!

1079
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,032
I waited here in this castle.

1080
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:56,342
I was so alone with this punishment...
- Shut up!

1081
01:17:56,552 --> 01:18:00,810
You came to me!
With me!

1082
01:18:05,808 --> 01:18:08,907
Back to me!
- Do not listen to the devil!

1083
01:18:09,313 --> 01:18:12,280
She wants to change!
- Use love!

1084
01:18:14,432 --> 01:18:17,409
And I promise that I will always
choose love.

1085
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:42,205
My love, stay with me! Returns!

1086
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:45,466
Back!
- My love!

1087
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:50,400
You up.

1088
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:53,679
Is life you chose.

1089
01:18:54,787 --> 01:18:55,944
My love!

1090
01:18:56,548 --> 01:18:57,660
No lies!

1091
01:18:58,568 --> 01:18:59,659
We are dead!

1092
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:01,362
We have a chance!

1093
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,270
You forgot the true God...

1094
01:19:08,846 --> 01:19:10,518
To be together again.

1095
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:13,499
You need to come back with me!

1096
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:16,956
You in your true home.

1097
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,671
Y puts you in charge of the earth!

1098
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,034
We waited...

1099
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,045
For hundreds of years...

1100
01:19:35,218 --> 01:19:37,236
For you to return with me.

1101
01:19:39,253 --> 01:19:42,046
Please... Do not stop now.

1102
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,610
Please...

1103
01:19:44,695 --> 01:19:46,815
Please come back to me.

1104
01:20:22,253 --> 01:20:27,433
With this blood, I break ties.

1105
01:20:28,436 --> 01:20:34,423
With this blood, I return to my worldly form
.

1106
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:55,750
The last demon.
It's time, my lord!

1107
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,346
Deten  "Satan".

1108
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,287
Please liberate his grip.

1109
01:21:05,988 --> 01:21:07,236
It's time, my lord.

1110
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,136
Thou art with me.

1111
01:21:11,854 --> 01:21:14,365
If, liberate from the grip of "Satan".

1112
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,106
Back to me, my love.

1113
01:22:09,289 --> 01:22:10,701
Demon disappears.

1114
01:22:54,786 --> 01:22:57,705
"The seven were called
by Elisabeta the castle."

1115
01:22:58,317 --> 01:23:00,532
"The day before
Pink Moon Wolf in the day,

01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:02,728
began with the ritual sacrifice of Beelzebub
".
