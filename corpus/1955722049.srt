♫ They got the beat ♫

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,550
♫ They got the beat ♫

9
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
♫ Yeah, they got the beat ♫

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
♫ Go-go music really makes us dance ♫

11
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,950
♫ Do the pony puts us in a trance ♫

00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,849

♫ Yeah, we got it! ♫

19
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,400
Excuse me! Dragon on the move!

20
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,450
Important Princess Documents coming through!

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,600
Wow! Everypony from Manehattan to Saddle Arabia is here!

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,600
I know, filly - we almost couldn't book a stable!

23
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,699
Princess Twilight must have her
hooves full with this giant festival!

24
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,600
Are you kidding?!

25
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:14,100
She's smart and organized and cool under pressure,
there's nothing she can't handle!

26
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,799
Ohm... my goodness
I can't handle this!

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,399
Ooo, nothing is working!!

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,299
I just have to get it together.

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,600
Just go in there. And ask.
This is YOUR Friendship Festival.

30
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,500
Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves!

31
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,600
Oohhh.

32
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,800
OK, Twilight.
Got all your charts and graphs!

33
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,700
Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike!
I'm just so nervous about this meeting!

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
Wha'chu talkin' about?

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,749
I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a
HUGE favor!

36
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,400
What if they reject me?!

37
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,500
It'll be fine!
Just remember the most important thing!

38
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,350
Smile??!!!

39
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,350
Uh. No!
You're a princess, too!

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Right.

41
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,300
Good morning Princesses!

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,300
Thank you all for seeing me.

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,349
I have an idea that I think will
make our Friendship Festival the

44
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,649
most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen!

45
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,650
Yes, Twilight, we are very excited.

46
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,499
Ponies have been arriving from all
over all morning!

47
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,599
I'd like to think it's to see us,
but Songbird Serenade

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
might be the bigger attraction.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,750
Yes, she is the “mane event”

50
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,999
...and to make it extra special,
I could use your help!

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Spike?

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,849
Songbird Serenade's performance is
not scheduled to start until

53
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,550
after you begin the sunset

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
and based on my precise calculation,
to get the very best lighting for the stage...

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,449
Princess Celestia, I was hoping you
could make sure the sun stays about

56
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,100
28.1 degrees to the South.

57
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,549
And Princess Luna

58
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,600
if you could raise the moon 62 degrees to the
North at the same time,

59
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,600
it would reflect the sunlight on the other
side and really frame the entire stage perfectly!

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,550
I...

61
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:27,049
I...
But wait... there's more!

62
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,399
Cadance, if you could use your
crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage,

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,250
the sun AND the moon will shine through it
and create a truly amazing light show!

64
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,749
Presenting: Songbird Serenade!

65
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,849
Yah, yah yah, Woo ho...

66
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,050
Whoooaaaaa!! Oof!

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,000
Ta-da...

68
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,999
So, you're saying you want us to
move the sun and the moon...

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,299
for the party?

70
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,300
Well, I'd do it myself except I
don't have your magic!

71
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,850
Twilight, each of us uses our powers
to serve Equestria in our own way.

72
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,700
You are the Princess of Friendship.
You already have all the magic you need.

73
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,050
So... that'd be a no?

74
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,950
YES!

75
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,350
Skies cleared and ready for the festival!

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
WHOA!!

77
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,949
Heads-up, Fluttershy!
OUT OF CONTROL BALLOON!!

78
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,750
Oh! I don't think it's the balloon
that's out of control, Pinkie Pie.

79
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,350
Hey y'all!

80
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,250
Anypony up for some free samples
of my family's applecider?

81
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,250
Thank you!

82
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Loved it!

83
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,800
Wow, Rarity, that's a fine job you're doing there.

84
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,349
'Course it might not get done
'til AFTER the concert!

85
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,749
Applejack, darling, anypony can do
“fine.”

86
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,350
Twilight asked me, so
clearly, she's going for fabulous.

87
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,399
And fabulous takes time.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,150
Fabulous takes FOREVER. But awesome...

89
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,350
...can get done in four seconds flat!
Faster if I do my Sonic Rainboom!

90
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,700
Ahh!

91
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:37,848
No

92
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:38,000
No

93
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,500
No

94
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,900
No!

95
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,900
Don't you DARE, Rainbow Dash!

96
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,350
It looks wretched enough already.

97
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,750
Oh, come on, it's fine.

98
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,700
IF you were raised in a barn.

99
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,300
No offense, Applejack.

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,450
None taken.

101
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,050
'Specially since I
wasn't raised in a barn.

102
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,450
My family
just happens to have a barn.

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,850
Where I was born.

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,100
And spent most of my formative years...

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,100
Raised in a barn!

106
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay, just two hundred and eighteen
things left to do and we're ready!

107
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,049
Hey Twilight...

108
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,449
Hello Spike.

109
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,450
Uh, hi Rarity.

110
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,750
How'd it go with the other
princesses? They like your idea?

111
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,650
I bet they loved it!!

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,949
Not exactly. They think I can make
today perfect without their magic.

113
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,250
And they are absolutely right, darling!

114
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,949
This festival is your brilliant idea,
and we know you're up to the task.

115
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,950
But what if I'm not?

116
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,350
What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage?

117
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,049
Or nopony makes a new friend?!

118
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,699
And if I fail at the festival, then who am I?!?

119
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,699
Twilight... look at me.

120
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,199
This, will be the biggest celebration
Equestria has ever seen!

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,599
As the Princess of Friendship,
you CANNOT fail.

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,899
This day will DEFINE who you are!

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,749
The pressure is INTENSE!

124
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,790
It's almost too much for any single pony to handle!

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,450
AHHH!

126
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,800
But you have us!

127
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,650

♫ But that is more than just a crown ♫

177
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,200
♫ It's a promise to bring ponies together ♫

178
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:36,050
♫ And never let any pony down ♫

179
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,050
♫ We've got an awful lot to bake ♫

180
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,450
♫ Each pony needs a piece of cake ♫

181
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,149
♫ Oh, wait! There's something better... ♫

182
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,500
♫ ... We can do ♫

183
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,600
♫ We're gonna need some more supplies ♫

184
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,600
♫ To make a really big surprise ♫

185
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,899
♫ She'll be so shocked... ♫

186
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,900
♫ She's sure to love it too ♫

187
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,200
♫ You got this ♫

188
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,250
♫ We got this together ♫

189
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,600
♫ It's the Festival of Friendship ♫

190
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,600
♫ Together we are one ♫

191
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,599
♫ A day we will never forget ♫

192
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,999
♫ And now everything is ready ♫

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
♫ So when the day is done ♫

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,150
♫ The weather ♫

195
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,100
♫ The banquet ♫

196
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
♫ The style ♫

197
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
♫ And music ♫

198
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:25,400
♫ All will be in perfect harmony! ♫

199
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Pinkie!

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oopsie!

201
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,750
Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon
needs a little bit more fine tuning.

202
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,400
Songbird Serenade!

203
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Is it really her?

204
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,200
It is, it is!

205
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,800
Hiya!

206
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm looking for the pony in charge?

207
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,000
I need to set up for my sound check.

208
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,749
Songbird Serenade?

209
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,750
Um, I was just going to check on you...

210
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,749
I'm Princess Twilight.

211
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,199
And sorry about the mess.

212
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm usually not so...

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,849
(How embarrassing!)

214
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,699
Caked in... cake?

215
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Heh heh.

216
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,550
You have visual on buttercream?

217
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,550
Visual confirmed, go for clean-up.

218
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,350
Storm clouds?!

219
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,250
I ordered perfect weather!

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,950
Rainbow Dash?!

221
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,900
Uh...

222
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,350
I... don't think those are storm clouds!

223
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,550
Ooh! I bet those are the clowns I ordered!

224
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,550
Or definitely NOT the clowns
I ordered.

225
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,400
Brian..

226
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,650
No!

227
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,300
Ponies of Equestria...

228
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
We come on behalf of the fearsome,

229
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,950
The powerful,

230
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,450
The almighty...

231
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,150
...Storm King!!

232
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,750
And now,

233
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,000
To deliver the evil, evil message:

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Put your hooves together
for COMMANDER TEMPEST!!

235
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,249
Is that a... unicorn?

236
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,450
I think so, but what happened to
her horn?

237
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,450
Tempest, is it?

238
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,700
How may we help you?

239
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,249
Ah, I'm so glad you asked...

240
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,200
How about we start with your
complete and total surrender.

241
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,250
Hi there, Princess of Friendship.

242
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,249
Not exactly sure what's going on,

243
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,250
but I know we can talk things out.

244
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,800
Oh goodie.

245
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,800
All four princesses.

246
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,400
Here's the deal, ladies,
I need your magic.

247
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,400
Give it up nicely, please...

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,400
...or we make it difficult...

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,399
For everyone!

250
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,749
And why should we cower before you?

251
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,950
There's one of you, and hundreds of us.

252
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,299
I was hoping you'd choose...

253
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
...difficult.

254
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,650
AHH!!

255
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,450
Cadance!

256
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,450
I can't stop it!

257
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,199
Luna, quick!
Go south!

258
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,350
Beyond the badlands!

259
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,200
Seek help from the Queen
of the Hippo...

260
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,750
LUNA!

261
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,150
Twilight!

262
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,500
Easy as pie.

263
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Oh I love pie.

264
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,250
Oh, you TOTALLY got the last princess!

265
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,750
That's not the Princess.

266
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,250
Grubber!

267
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,100
Get.

268
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,700
Her.

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,550
NOW!

270
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:40,350
GUYS, WE GOTTA GET THE PRINCESS!!

271
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,250
Over here y'all!

272
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,950
C'mon!

273
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,350
Which one of you guys are going down there?

274
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,449
I would, but I just had a hearty meal

275
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,800
and I will sink and
I WILL side cramp.

276
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm very big boned

277
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,050
I sink quick.

278
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,600
Everypony OK?

279
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,550
I think my bottom's on backward.

280
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,650
We just got our cupcakes handed to
us by the worst party crasher ever!

281
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,600
We gotta go back there and fight!

282
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,400
You saw the size of those goons!

283
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,600
You seriously wanna go BACK?!

284
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,800
So now what?

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,750
We can't hide here forever,
and let's be honest,

286
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,050
We can't go back...
Look what they did to the princesses.

287
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,650
We've got to keep them from Twilight.

288
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
The queen...

289
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,500
Yeah, the Queen!

290
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,500
Uh, what queen?

291
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,900
Celestia told Luna to find the
Queen of the...

292
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,350
Hippos.

293
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,050
Luna can't, so I have to.

294
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,449
Uh, hippos?? Seriously?

295
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,950
I've heard they're surprisingly
graceful for their size!

296
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,899
But they're always hungry.

297
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,550
Hungry?

298
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,550
Hippos?

299
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,949
They're somewhere South... past the badlands.

300
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,550
That means we'll have to... leave Equestria!

301
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,550
I'm not even packed!

302
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,550
I understand you're scared.

303
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,550
And nopony else has to go.

304
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,550
But I have to find this Queen.

305
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,150
She might be our only hope.

306
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,499
Well, you're not getting ALL the glory.

307
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,050
We're in this together.

308
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,150
We got yer back!

309
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
Indeedy!

310
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,900
I am ready to save Equestria!

311
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,750
Yay!

312
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,599
We're all behind you, Twilight!

313
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,699
Let's go find this Hippo!

314
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Uh... South?

315
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,199
Boingy boingy boingy boingy boingy!

316
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Anypony up for a game of “I SPY?”

317
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,700
No really, come on!

318
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,000
I Spy, with my little eye,
something that is orange.

319
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,700
No takers?

320
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,550
It's you, Applejack!

321
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,050
All this power, wasted on parties.

322
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,000
When there are far greater uses.

323
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Well, answer it!

324
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,900
Where am I supposed to be looking.

325
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,649
I never understand how this spell works!

326
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,650
TEMPEST!

327
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,450
Over here, Your Excellency.

328
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,050
Where?!

329
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,700
Over here.

330
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,050
Huh?!

331
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:50,900
No, no, right.

332
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,850
Look right.

333
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,850
My right?

334
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,300
Yep.

335
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,100
Oh, there you are.

336
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,850
Here's the deal.

337
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:57,549
I'm in the middle of a BIG re-brand here.

338
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,299
“The Storm King” is tracking well,
as “intensely intimidating”.

339
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,999
But you know what?
I need to back it up.

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,249
You know what I need to back it up with?

341
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,100
A STORM!

342
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,200
That would be great!

343
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,650
You promised me magic that could
control the elements,

344
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,899
and right now I'm holding a what - a branch, a twig.

345
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,600
Blehh!

346
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,349
That would be The Staff of Sacanas,
Your Excellency,

347
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,300
And it will channel the magic of
the four rulers of this land.

348
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Mm Hmm.

349
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,650
Mm Hmmmm.

350
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:23,250
You'll soon have the power of
a hundred armies.

351
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,349
So that would be a YES on you
locking down the four

352
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,150
pegacornicuses or whatever you call them?

353
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,599
Give me three days.

354
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
I'll have everything ready for your arrival.

355
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,650
Remember Tempest,
only I have the power to make you whole.

356
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,250
Make this twig work,
and you'll get your reward.

357
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,250
Fail me, and your horn won't be
the only thing that's broken.

358
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,250
It won't be a problem.

359
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,549
Great! I'm r-ready to power up,

360
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,400
c-crash and b-bang,

361
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:56,650
be the b-biggest baddest bugaloooo...

362
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,599
Sorry. Bad spell service.

363
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,760
You want me to call him back?

364
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,749
Do you have the princess?

365
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,750
Well... uh... funny story.

366
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It kinda seems like she...

367
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,049
she might
have, like, you know...

368
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,050
Got away...

369
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,350
A little bit.

370
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,200
I know you're disappointed,

371
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,200
But I got one word for you.

372
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,150
Spongecake.

373
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,999
I need all FOUR for the staff to work.

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,050
Hey... I know.

375
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,549
I want the Storm King to fix
that crazy horn as badly as you do!

376
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,950
It's looks like a crackly chipped
tooth, on the top of your head!

377
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,750
And you know you don't look
good in hats.

378
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,350
That princess is not going to keep
me from getting my horn back.

379
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,350
Prepare my ship.

380
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,000
Please. How far can one little
pony get on her own.

381
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,550
There's...

382
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,750
Sand in my...

383
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,300
Everything...

384
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,850
Saving...

385
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,600
Equestria!

386
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,949
Oh look!

387
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,600
Maybe this guy knows
which way to go!

388
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,600
What's that, friend?

389
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,799
We're lost?!

390
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,100
Ha ha ha ha... ha ha ha ha...

391
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,500
We could be going in circles!

392
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,950
Endless sand.

393
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,300
Nothing for miles...

394
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,200
But sand...

395
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,200
And this rock...

396
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,700
And this cactus...

397
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,300
And this road...

398
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,650
This road.

399
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,200
Hnh? A road?

400
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,999
Where there's a road...

401
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There's a...

402
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,300
Whoa!

403
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,100
Cool!

404
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:16,650
What is that?

405
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,200
OOOOO!

406
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,300
A city!

407
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,300
We are DOING IT,
YOU GUYS!

408
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
You know what they say...

409
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,250
Where there's a city,

410
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,000
There's a SPA!

411
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,400
WHO says that?

412
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,950
In case you forgot, we're on a
mission to save Equestria.

413
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,400
I can multi-task.

414
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,949
Don't worry, little one,
we'll let you go!

415
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,700
To the highest bidder!

416
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,750
Nice!

417
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,250
Oooooh!

418
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,250
Hey, you with the horn!

419
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,900
You selling?

420
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,950
Hi there!

421
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,200
Oh, I'm sorry...
here, let me help you with that!

422
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,700
Hey, no magic around my merchandise!

423
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,000
Hmm, very interesting...

424
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,949
OK, we just gotta stick together.

425
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,849
Be careful who you talk to, and try
to blend in.

426
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,599
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

427
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,200
PLEEEEAAAASE!

428
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,549
CAN ANYPONY TAKE US TO THE
QUEEN OF THE HIPPOS??

429
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,949
You want something - you gotta give
somethin'!

430
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,250
Well, how about a big warm hug from
a grateful pony friend?

431
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
How about this comb that I've never used?

432
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,600
A picture of my sister Maud?

433
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,600
This BREATH mint??!

434
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,000
Seriously buddy. Help me help you!

435
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,450
Pinkie... you can't just take off,

436
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,449
And you don't need to announce to
EVERY...

437
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,749
RELAX Twilight, I've totally got
this.

438
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,350
How much for the giant gecko?

439
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,749
Who you callin' a gecko?

440
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,299
Uh, Spike isn't for sale.

441
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,999
I WANT THAT fancy purple HAIR!
I'll give you TWO Storm Bucks for it!

442
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
TWO Storm Bucks?! It's worth more
than that.

443
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,150
GIMME THAT PINK ONE!

444
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,150
I'LL TAKE THAT BLUE ONE!

445
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:17,299
NO, I WANT THE BLUE ONE!

446
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,449
I NEED THAT LIZARD!

447
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,876
I'LL TAKE THE PICTURE OF YOUR SISTER!

448
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,100
I WANT ALL SEVEN FOR MY COLLECTION!

449
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,849
Back up everyone!

450
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,250
BACK. IT. UP!

451
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,749
Y'all in some serious danger!

452
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,650
Now you didn't touch any of them,
did you?

453
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
Just look at all those colors-
you think that's natural?

454
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,300
They're infected with pastelus coloritis!!

455
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,999
Now you listen here, fella, there ain't...

456
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Don't worry, don't worry

457
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:46,949
As long as you're not
covered in purple splotches, you'll be fine.

458
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,950
Uh oh.

459
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,950
What do I do?!

460
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,200
Enjoy your last moments.
And don't touch anyone.

461
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,450
Because parts will fall off.

462
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,650
Me parts!!

463
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,250
Well, all right.

464
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,150
You.

465
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,350
Are.

466
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,750
Awesome!!!!

467
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,950
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:08,150
And quite charming.

469
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,050
Huh.

470
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,250
Capper's the name.
Charming's my game.

471
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,750
So, to the hippos then?

472
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,900
I don't know if we should trust him.

473
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,450
We could definitely use a friend out here.

474
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,300
You know what?

475
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,900
Little Cotton Candy Hair was right.

476
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,950

Ooh, sort of a...

529
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,299
Roco-hobo-Bohemian-hodgepodge.

530
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,749
Apologies for the state of my litterbox

531
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,750
I wasn't expecting guests!

532
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,950
Oooh, so many fun breakables!

533
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,250
Y'all sure y'all want the Hippos?

534
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,500
Yessiree! The QUEEN of the Hippos!

535
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,349
Not like the queen of lions, or the
tigers, or the bears...?

536
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,150
Oh my!

537
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
Huh...?

538
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,250
Please, PLEASE, I don't know
anything!!

539
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,450
You really think the ponies got
this far?

540
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,950
Oh, they're here.

541
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,450
Attention!
A little purple pony passed this way.

542
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,299
Tell me where she is...

543
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
Or somethin' real bad's gonna happen.

544
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,049
You think we're gonna fall for this again?

545
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,500
I don't know what kinda scam you're workin'
with Capper and the rest of your friends, but...

546
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,350
Friends?

547
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,100
Poison or no poison... you're gonna pay.

548
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,200
Oh, Fishman just got dropped!

549
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,450
Now, about this Capper...

550
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,549
Stop playin' me!

551
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,049
A Sonic Rainboom?

552
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,650
That's not a real thing!

553
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,000
Is that a real thing?

554
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,250
I'll show ya!

555
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,999
No no no - I don't need you sonic
rainbooming up in my place

556
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Thank you very much.

557
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,400
Whoa, hey, hold up now.

558
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:44,850
Whoa.

559
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,100
Here you go! I do apologize.

560
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,700
If we were back home
I could have done something truly fabulous.

561
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,449
Okay. What's the catch?

562
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,250
Nothing!
After all that you've done for us?

563
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,250
Consider it a thank you.

564
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,150
Oh, uh, don't thank me. Really.

565
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,750
Guys!

566
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,650
We've been looking for the wrong Queen!

567
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,650
We don't need the Queen of the Hippos

568
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,499
We need the Queen of the hippoGRIFFS!

569
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,450
Part Pony, part Eagle.

570
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,050
Oh! Oh, the HippoGRIFFS?

571
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,650
Now the trouble with that is, no one knows...

572
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,599
Where they are.

573
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,449
Says here they're on the top of Mt. Aris.

574
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,450
You mean the mountain right outside
the window?

575
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,749
Objects in windows may be less
mountainous than they appear

576
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Heh heh heh...

577
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,500
Let's go, everypony.

578
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,549
Wait! You can't, you can't make it
by yourselves!

579
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:44,399
You'd need an airship...
And lucky for you, I can get you a ride!

580
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,650
I think we can get there on our own.

581
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,750
Here's Verko!

582
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,899
These ponies better shoot rainbow
lasers outta their eyes...

583
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,850
...if they're gonna settle your debt!

584
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,850
Brought the big cage.
Let's load em up!

585
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,049
You were... you were going to SELL US?!

586
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,450
I KNEW IT!

587
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,300
We gotta get out of here!

588
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,850
Silly little ponies

589
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Tempest!

590
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,150
Trusting strangers?
Big mistake.

591
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,350
Big.

592
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,500
Huge!

593
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,500
Hoo Hoo my goodness!

594
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,550
Well look at you!

595
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,349
With your scary broken horn
and scowly eyes...

596
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:39,000
What tricks do you know, my little pony wony?!

597
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,350
...not bad.

598
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,350
Go, go!

599
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,750
Get her - now!!!

600
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,850
You gonna be scared now, ponies!

601
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,050
I'M...

602
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,150
GONNA...

603
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,750
BE...

604
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,650
SICK!!

605
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,450
We have to get there, to the docks!

606
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
Hurry!

607
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,000
That's it - don't look down now!

608
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
YAY!!

609
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,700
Pinkie!!!

610
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,050
Best. Escape. Plan... EVER!!

611
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
WHAT?!

612
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,150
Shhh.

613
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,050
Did you hear something?

614
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,050
Yeah, probably just the rats.

615
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,750
If we find 'em, we'll eat 'em.

616
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,950
Rats?!

617
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,950
Now, where are they going?

618
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,950
Okay! No need for violence!

619
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,950
Uh, they're headed...

620
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,750
They're headed east.
Yeah to, to Black Skull Island.

621
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,999
So, uh, glad I could be of service
to His Majesty the Storm King.

622
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,450
I'll just be on my way...

623
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,350
...when I get my princess.

624
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,950
Until then, your fate is still...
up in the air.

625
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,350
Oh, you're gonna go in the skiff,

626
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Which is a boat

627
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,750
Specifically, a air boat!

628
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,799
We make a great team.

629
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,699
I love it how you said his fate is up in the
air and then I said

630
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
“you're GONNA be in the air in the air boat...”

631
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,150
What do ya think, Twilight, should
we just... ask 'em to take us?

632
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,050
The last time we trusted somepony,
he tried to sell us!

633
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,550
Hey guys...

634
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,550
...come check this out!

635
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,750
Looks like a pack of stowaways.

636
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,850
What are we s'posed to do with 'em?

637
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,150
I think we tie 'em up!

638
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,200
Nah - we clip their wings!

639
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,300
Nah, we SCAR 'em...

640
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,850
...emotionally!

641
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

642
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,350
What say the book, Captain Celaeno?

643
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,200
Storm King's rulebook says...

644
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,700
Throw them overboard.

645
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,750
All right, that's lunch!!

646
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,550
What?!

647
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,700
Whoa whoa whoa...

648
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,400
So, you were
about to toss us overboard

649
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,000
And you stopped for a lunch break?!

650
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,649
Storm King only allows one break a
day for meals.

651
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,500
Then it's back to
hauling goods.

652
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,300
So you're delivery guys?

653
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,600
And gals. These uniforms aren't
exactly doing us any favors...

654
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,200
Then, can you DELIVER us to Mt. Aris?

655
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,650
Sorry. We do what The Storm King
orders, or we suffer his wrath.

656
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,550
Right, still going overboard.

657
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,150
Eh, it's nothing personal. Pudding?

658
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,450
There's pudding?!

659
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,650
You weren't ALWAYS delivery birds,
were you?

660
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,800
What about BEFORE the
Storm King??

661
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,250
Yeah, we used to be much more
adventurous.

662
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,500
Ooh! I met that guy in the desert!

663
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,649
Whoa... you used to be pirates?!

664
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,400
Uh, we prefer the term,
“Swashbuckling Treasure Hunters.”

665
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,200
So, pirates.

666
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,200
You birds have a choice to make.

667
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,549
You can let some cloven-hoofed
Storm King tell you

668
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,600
how to live your lives, or...

669
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,800
...you can be awesome again.

670
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,549
Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a
good time for a...

671
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,150
♫ I know the world can get you down ♫

Awesome!
I knew you had it in ya!

711
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,550
And now, for the finishing touch!

712
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Rainboom

713
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,450
Rainboom

714
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,550
Rainboom

715
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,100
Oh

716
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,300
No

717
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,500
No

718
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,100
No

719
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,950
NOO!

720
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,900
Rainboom

721
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,600
Aw yeah! Ha ha ha, woo!!

722
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,050
Wow!!

723
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,750
Look at that rainbow!

724
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,050
Look at that rainbow!

725
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,850
Whoa, that's so cool.

726
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,650
Yeah - of them to alert us.

727
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,250
Funny though, they don't seem to be
headed to Black Skull Island.

728
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,150
Like, Hah Hah funny, or huh huh...

729
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,300
Yeah!! Ha ha

730
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,350
Nice!

731
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,000
Storm guards!
Looks like they found you!

732
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,950
Tempest!

733
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,649
Secure the rigging!
Lock down the cargo!

734
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,999
Everyone
prepare to be boarded!

735
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh goodness!!!

736
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,300
You think
she saw my sonic rainboom?

737
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,450
Are you KIDDING me?!

738
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,449
Where is the pony princess?

739
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,600
Princess?

740
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,500
Princess... Princess...

741
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,650
Nope. All we're hauling is Storm
King merchandise.

742
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,599
You do realize that if you were to
shelter fugitives,

743
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,450
The Storm King
would be quite... explosive.

744
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:56,149
We have to get off this ship before
they tell Tempest we're here!

745
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,000
We helped them get their mojo back.
They're not going to give us up!

746
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,650
Whoa!

747
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,350
I've got this.

748
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:27,149
Now, I'm gonna to count to 3 and if
you don't tell me where they are...

749
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,150
...your ship is going down.

750
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:31,650
1...

751
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,150
Hold this.

752
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,650
What are you doing?

753
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,500
2...

754
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,350
Oh this is inteeeeeense...

755
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
3!!

756
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,750
What?!

757
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,650
OH

758
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,050
FOR

759
00:44:56,051 --> 00:44:57,099
CELESTIA'S

760
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,600
SAKE!!!

761
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,900
WHEEEEE!!!!

762
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,950
I can't look!!

763
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,150
What in the hay is she up to?

764
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,750
Oh, thank goodness!

765
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,200
Heeyew! Quick thinkin' Twilight!

766
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,250
Yahoo! Haha!

767
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
That was fun! Can we do it again?!

768
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,550
Next stop, Mt. Aris!

769
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,250
We're home free!

770
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
There's no ponies.

771
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,950
But I found this.

772
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,450
It's a kind of a cupcake
with some sprinkles...

773
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,000
Oh yeah,
and I found this, too.

774
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,900
Ah.

775
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,800
Wow. This is a real artist.

776
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
Looks like they're heading to MOUNT ARIS.

777
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,749
Really? Mt., Mt. Aris??

778
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,899
I didn't,
well that's my mist...

779
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,249
I didn't know they...

780
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,249
Mt. Aris, that's my bad I didn't...

781
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,650
That my... I'm sorry, I'm
very very sorry...

782
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,500
Now, about your betrayal.

783
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,500
We had to crash the balloon at the
BOTTOM of the mountain?!

784
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,250
That's it!

785
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,050
I simply.

786
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:23,850
Can not.

787
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,100
Even!

788
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,250
I have nothing.

789
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,200
The bad guys have won!

790
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,100
I'm so sorry...

791
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,000
We're almost there!

792
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,900
Will you stop saying that!

793
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,300
No, really - we're actually here!

794
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,350
This is it!

795
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,750
Oooooooo!!

796
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,750
Well I'll be! Heh heh.

797
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,650
Hippogriffs, here we come!

798
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,900
Ah, time to rest my hooves.

799
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,750
Are we sure this is the right place?

800
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,850
Hello? Is anypony home?

801
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,700
No Hippogriffies here.

802
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:17,800
Or here.

803
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,500
Or here.

804
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,050
Or here.

805
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:19,350
Or here.

806
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,400
Or here.

807
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,150
Wait.

808
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,750
Nope. This place is em-pty.

809
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:32,900
But Celestia. The map...
They have to be here!

810
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,000
Something bad happened here.

811
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,850
Something that turned this whole
place into a ghost town.

812
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,650
A g-g-g-g-ghost town?

813
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,950
It's coming from over there.

814
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
What was that?

815
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,300
Hey! Wait up!

816
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,650
CANNONBALL!!!!!

817
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,600
PINKIE!!

818
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
She's gone!

819
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,750
Now what?

820
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Huh?

821
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,250
Oh boy.

822
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,250
I HATE epic adventures.

823
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,050
Way to leave it 'til the last
minute, Twilight.

824
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,550
I didn't make these bubbles...

825
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,100
Then... who did?

826
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,350
Hello? We're looking for the
Hippogriffs.

827
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,450
How do I know I can trust you?

828
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,500
Please! The Storm King invaded our
land and we need their help.

829
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,250
The Storm King?!

830
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,700
I'm so glad I saved you guys!

831
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm totally taking you to my mom!!

832
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,400
Does your mother know where they are?

833
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,650
She might have an idea...

834
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,550
Hoo hoo!

835
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,450
We're almost there!

836
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Wow!

837
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
MOTHER!!!!

838
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,300
Look what I found!

839
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,549
Is it another shell?

840
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:42,950
Uh-uh

841
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:46,200
Because I am telling you, if it is another shell
I am...

842
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,250
Princess Skystar!

843
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
What have you done?!

844
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,050
You know surface dwellers
are forbidden here!!!

845
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,350
Guards!

846
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,250
No no no - Mom Mom Mom, please!

847
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,350
It is SO not like that!

848
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,350
The Storm King is trying to destroy their home, too!

849
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,350
We need to find the Hippogriffs.

850
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,950
Do you know what happened to them?

851
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,449
Well of course I know.

852
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,599
I'm the Queen.

853
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,800
I know everything.

854
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,450
Ooh, ooh - it's SUCH a good story!!!

855
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,100
Don't you DARE tell them!

856
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,400
Once Upon A Time, like...

857
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,200
A while ago,
the Hippogriffs DID live on Mt. Aris.

858
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,200
Did I not say don't tell them?

859
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,600
But hey - I'm just the queen,
don't mind me.

860
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,050
FINE. I CAN'T tell you

861
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,700
But if I COULD tell you,

862
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,300
I'd say that that horned beast DID show up
to steal their magic...

863
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,250
Seriously?

864
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,799
But to keep it out of his clutches,
their brave and majestic leader, Queen Novo

865
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,750
Hid them deep
underwater where he could never go.

866
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,400
We are,

867
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,750
Well, we were,

868
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,050
The Hippogriffs!

869
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,150
TAH DAH!

870
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:57,410
But... I totally did NOT tell you that.

871
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,400
Well. I guess the pearl is out the oyster now.

872
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,050
I am Queen Novo.

873
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,750
Hold on now, let me get this straight.

874
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:13,250
When the Storm King came,
you just abandoned your entire city and fled?

875
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,300
We didn't flee, we swam...

876
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,100
You know, in order to flee.

877
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,849
But... how?

878
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,050
Oh! Can we show them?

879
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,599
These are the first guests
we've had in like FOREVER!

880
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,050
Canwe

881
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:23,450
Canwe

882
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,850
Canwe

883
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,150
Canwe

884
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,450
Canwe

885
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:29,800
Well, I suppose I should make sure
it still works.

886
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:24,750
Canwe

887
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,150
Canwe

888
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,450
Canwe

889
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Canwe

890
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,900
Careful now.

891
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
Wow!

892
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,700
These fins are divine!

893
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:05,350
Hey, Applejack! I'll race ya to
that coral!

894
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
You're on!

895
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,350
Woo-hoo!

896
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,600
Try it, Fluttershy.

897
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,300
Yay.

898
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
Guys.

899
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,350
Guys!

900
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,750
What is

901
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,100
Happening?!?

902
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,099
Aww, so cute!

903
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,100
This is amazing!

904
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,649
With this, we could transform
everypony at home into...

905
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,550
...something POWERFUL enough
to face the Storm King's army!

906
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,800
Or, it could end up in his greedy claws.

907
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,600
But...

908
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,850
Honey, I'm sorry about your home.
I truly am.

909
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,000
But my responsibility is
to protect MY subjects.

910
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
The pearl...

911
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,600
...is not going anywhere.

912
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,700
But we've come all this way!

913
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,200
And you can't just hide down here,
trapped forever,

914
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,150
There's so much you're missing!

915
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,449
We are 100 percent

916
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,750
Okay. With. That

917
00:54:58,650 --> 00:54:59,650
Yes, Jamal?

918
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,550
Ooh! Time for my seaweed wrap.

919
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,200
Yes, a massage, too! Mama needs
her deep tissue.

920
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,750
So that's it... we left home for nothin'?

921
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,450
Ohmigosh

922
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,950
Best idea

923
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,950
You can stay with us...

924
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,450
FOREVER!!!

925
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,700
There are so many things we can do!

926
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,000
We could make friendship bracelets
out of shells,

927
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,900
And picture frames
out of shells,

928
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,250
And decorative waste
baskets out of shells.

929
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,750
Oh, I have so many projects
that involve shells.

930
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,400
Now I have someone new to
share them with.

931
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,670
I mean, aside from
my friends Shelly and Sheldon.

932
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,050
Right, Shelly and Sheldon?

933
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,700
Get it?

934
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,900
Oh, oh - that sounds lovely,
darling,

935
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,450
But you must realize we
can't stay.

936
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,500
We've gotta get back to our
families.

937
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,350
Oh no.

938
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:54,800
Of course. Of course!

939
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,399
Of course you have
your own friends back home.

940
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,950
It's fine - it's fine!

941
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,450
Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways.

942
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,480
It's probably for the best.

943
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:05,950
Yeah,
I'll just, um

944
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:07,949
I'll get Mom to, uh,

945
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,550
Turn you back so you can go home.

946
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,699
I KNOW we have to go, but...

947
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,800
You guys saw how disappointed
Princess Skystar was.

948
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,850
Couldn't we stay for
just a LITTLE longer?

949
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,699
Pinkie, we just don't have time...

950
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,850
Oh no. No, no. Pinkie's right.

951
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,400
Say what now?

952
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,800
Well, we still need to come up with
a plan to get back.

953
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,750
A few minutes
won't make a huge difference.

954
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,250
And if there's anypony who can cram a
lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye,

955
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,250
It's Pinkie Pie.

956
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:46,550
So go ahead and show Skystar the
best time ever!

957
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,550
I won't let you down!

958
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm counting on it.

959
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,700
It's probably for the best.

960
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,849
♫ Hey now don't be sad ♫

961
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,850
♫ I know we can not stay ♫

962
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,549
♫ But we've got a couple minutes ♫

963
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,250
♫ And a little time to play ♫

964
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,000
♫ I know you have important things ♫

965
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,350
♫ So it's okay, just go ♫

966
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,949
♫ But we can still pick one small
little thing ♫

967
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,200
♫ To do with you, y'know! ♫

968
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,600
♫ One small thing
doesn't seem like a lot ♫

969
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,650
♫ One small thing
work with time time you've got ♫

970
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,149
♫ Soon one small thing becomes two ♫

971
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,150
♫ After two perhaps another few ♫

972
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,699
♫ Then one small thing is not so small! ♫

973
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,350
♫ One small thing can be
the biggest thing of all! ♫

974
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,950
♫ All right now since you're here ♫

975
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,250
♫ Let's see what we can do ♫

976
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,899
♫ Swim with the flow until you go ♫

977
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,399
♫ Together me and you ♫

978
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,700
♫ I've got necklaces for everyfish! ♫

979
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,150
♫ So what else do ya got? ♫

980
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,750
♫ Well, we could play the bubblefish ♫

981
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,350
♫ You'll like this one a lot! ♫

982
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,249
♫ One small thing
It's a good place to start ♫

983
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,350
♫ Just one small thing ♫

984
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,149
♫ One small thing
and we don't seem so far apart ♫

985
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,249
♫ Don't seem apart ♫

986
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,399
♫ Soon one small thing leads to more ♫

987
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,149
♫ It's so much more than there
was before ♫

988
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,750
♫ Just one small thing and
you will see! ♫

989
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,350
♫ The start of something big
for you and me ♫

990
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,050
♫ One small thing ♫

991
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:44,499
♫ Just one small thing ♫

992
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,549
♫ Or a tall thing ♫

993
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,999
♫ Just one tall thing ♫

994
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
♫ Or a sing thing ♫

995
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:49,499
♫ Just one sing-y thing ♫

996
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,549
♫ Or a bling thing ♫

997
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,850
♫ Just one bling-y thing ♫

998
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,125
♫ A conga thing ♫

999
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:54,350
♫ Yeah a conga thing ♫

1000
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,950
♫ Or a longah thing ♫

1001
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:57,050
♫ Just a longah thing ♫

1002
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,699
♫ A blue thing, true thing,
you thing ♫

1003
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,200
♫ A whee thing, sea thing,
me thing ♫

1004
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,250
♫ So many things and everything ♫

1005
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,750
♫ Until our time is done ♫

1006
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,649
♫ There's one small thing for each ♫

1007
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,100
♫ And everyone!! ♫

1008
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,799
♫ One small thing ♫

1009
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,949
♫ So much we can create ♫

1010
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,699
♫ You and me ♫

1011
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,650
♫ We started something great ♫

1012
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,249
♫ It's so amazing look around ♫

1013
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:28,450
♫ At all the happy sights and sounds ♫

1014
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,950
♫ One small thing,
is big it's true! ♫

1015
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,650
♫ You did this all for us ♫

1016
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,300
♫ I just wish there was
one small thing ♫

1017
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,900
♫ An extra-special kind of thing ♫

1018
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:45,600
♫ That we could do for you... ♫

1019
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:51,850
♫ One small thing ♫

1020
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,750
Well, I guess there is one small
thing we can do...

1021
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,800
The pearl alarm!

1022
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,500
Oh no, the pearl alarm!

1023
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,000
NO!

1024
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:28,900
Please!

1025
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:32,250
All of this so you could sneak in
and take the pearl?

1026
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:37,250
THIS is why we don't bring
strangers into our home!

1027
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:44,600
You don't DESERVE to be one of us...

1028
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:26,450
What were you thinking?! I mean,
STEALING their pearl??

1029
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,900
It was the only way to save
Equestria!

1030
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,900
Except it WASN'T!

1031
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,950
The Queen was going to say “yes”!

1032
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,999
We did what you told us and that's
what made her realize we were

1033
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,450
ponies worth saving.

1034
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:43,700
Unless... you didn't really want us
to show her the best time ever!

1035
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,600
You just wanted us to distract her!

1036
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:51,200
I never would have done it, but
this isn't Equestria!

1037
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,500
We can't just dance around with con artists,

1038
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,750
Make rainbooms in the sky and
expect everything to work out!

1039
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,600
It's NOT enough, WE are NOT enough!

1040
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,750
No, Twilight.

1041
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,199
WE stuck together.

1042
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,250
WE were gonna get the help we needed.

1043
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,400
The only thing that stopped us, was YOU.

1044
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,600
Well, I'm doing the best I can!

1045
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,050
It's all on me.

1046
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:15,250
I'm the one Tempest wants,
I'm the last Princess...

1047
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,650
You're ALSO the only one who
doesn't trust her FRIENDS!

1048
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,300
Well maybe I would have been better
off without FRIENDS LIKE YOU!!!

1049
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,850
Pinkie... I...

1050
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,350
I just can't talk to you right now.

1051
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,650
Twilight...

1052
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,850
It's okay

1053
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,850
You'll figure it out.

1054
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,150
No...

1055
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,800
I can't...

1056
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,200
I ruined everything.

1057
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,150
There's no chance to save Equestria now.

1058
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,200
It's all my fault...

1059
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Spike?

1060
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,750
AHHH!!

1061
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,200
No no no no no... no!

1062
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,250
SPIKE!

1063
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,800
Twilight!!!

1064
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,150
Aw, the Princess of Friendship...

1065
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,250
...with no friends.

1066
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,900
And no way out.

1067
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,850
Why are you doing this?

1068
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,300
You're a pony!

1069
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,050
Just like me.

1070
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,100
I'm nothing like you.

1071
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,900
And more than you'll ever be.

1072
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,200
♫ It's time you learned a lesson ♫

1073
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,650
♫ It's time that you understand ♫

1074
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,700
♫ Don't ever count on anybody else ♫

1075
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:15,250
♫ In this or any other land ♫

1076
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,750
♫ I once hoped for friendship ♫

1077
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,850
♫ To find a place among my kind ♫

1078
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,150
♫ But those were the childish wishes ♫

1079
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:30,449
♫ Of someone who was blind ♫

1080
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:34,500
♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1081
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,750

01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:45,050
♫ You caged at my command ♫

01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,550
♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1085
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,050

♫ Come now little one ♫

1088
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,800
♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1089
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:12,750
♫ We all start out the same

1090
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:20,250
♫ Shielded from the many ways

1091
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,800
♫ But then there comes a moment ♫

1092
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,600
♫ A simple truth that you must face ♫

1093
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,650
♫ If you depend on others ♫

01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,150
♫ You'll never find your place ♫

01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,400
♫ And as you take that first step ♫

1096
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:08,000
♫ Upon a path that's all your own ♫

1097
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:12,000
♫ You see it all so clearly ♫

1098
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,750
♫ The best way to survive is all alone ♫

1099
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:23,699
♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1100
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,900
♫ And see the world from where I stand ♫

1101

♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1104
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,800
♫ And behold the fading light ♫

1105
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:46,250
♫ It's time to grow up
and get wise ♫

1106
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:48,150
♫ Come now little one ♫

1107
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:52,850
♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1108
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,900
♫ Open up your eyes ♫

1109
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,350
I'm so sorry you felt so alone.

1110
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,500
I saw the truth.

1111
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,850
My “friends” abandoned me
when times got tough.

1112
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,050
Looks like I'm not the only one.

1113
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:30,250
Face it, Princess.

1114
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,250
Friendship has failed you, too.

1115
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,050
Friendship didn't fail me.

1116
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,200
I failed friendship.

1117
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,250
This whole journey was such a
mistake!

1118
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,800
All we wanted was
somepony to help us!

1119
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:11,000
You think maybe it's time we talk
to Twilight?

1120
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:15,700
She's been taken!!!

1121
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:17,150
What?!

1122
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,500
Twilight's been taken!

1123
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,950
Tempest
she grabbed her and took her on her ship!

1124
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:25,050
We gotta get her back!

1125
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,750
How?! We'll never catch up!

1126
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,650
And we got no way to defeat those
monsters...

1127
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,449
Well, good thing I happen to know
of a group of...

1128
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,900
...mighty heroes that
could handle this easily!

1129
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,000
Well, look what the cat dragged
in...

1130
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,700
Himself!

1131
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:48,500
These heroes have faced the Storm
King's army and escaped!

1132
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,849
I've seen them tackle the streets
of the roughest towns,

1133
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:57,400
Break out of the tightest situations, and
inspire others to join their cause!

1134
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,400
Now don't get too excited,
he's just talking about us.

1135
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,000
They even escaped certain doom at
the hooves of Commander Tempest!

1136
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, that was pretty great.

1137
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,000
Are you kidding me??

1138
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,000
That was AWESOME!

1139
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,199
Figured you could use a claw.

1140
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,500
We're onboard to help you fight the
Storm King!

1141
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:28,300
Just not on board our
actual ship...

1142
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,800
That crazy unicorn sunk it... but
you got back our arrgghhh!

1143
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,900
And we're ready to kick some booty!

1144
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,000
Is that what I think that is?!?

1145
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,350
Hellooooo! Me again!

1146
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:07,299
I'm gonna get SO grounded but I
talked things over with Shelly and Sheldon and...

1147
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,940
...they pointed out that you were just trying to help your
friends!

1148
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,900
So I wanna help, too!

1149
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:17,450
Because you know, one small thing
can make a really big difference!

1150
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:23,800
That's it, right? We didn't make
friends with anypony else?

1151
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,899
All right, y'all.

1152
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,900
I think our course is clear.

1153
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,300
Y'all ready to do this thing?

1154
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,800
We're coming, Twilight!

1155
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,850
Yee haw!!

1156
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,000
Aw yeah! Ha ha!!

1157
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:42,000
As soon as we bake up a plan!

1158
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:56,900
♫ I am here and I see your pain ♫

1159
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,499
♫ Through the storm ♫

1160
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,750
♫ Through the clouds, the rain ♫

1161
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,400
♫ I'm telling you, you cannot escape... ♫

1162
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:56,025
Tempest, don't do this! Don't give
the Storm King...

1163
01:12:56,026 --> 01:12:59,550
Your magic? Did you think you'd
keep it all to yourself?

1164
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,050
Time to share.

1165
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:07,150
I'd love for everybody out there to
know what I can REALLY do.

1166
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,800
Ooh, fascinating!

1167
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,200
What CAN you really do?

1168
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:17,200
Your bidding, of course, your
mighty one!

1169
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,850
Bidding's good - I like bidding!

1170
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,950
Um, what are you supposed to be?

1171
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm the Princess of Friendship.

1172
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,000
Oh. That's nice.

1173
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,750
Why is this one still moving?

1174
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:44,000
She and her friends put up a bit of
a fight, but she's alone now.

1175
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,200
She won't be a problem.

1176
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,749
Yeah, so SPEAKING of problems.

1177
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,849
This place. It seems... a little too,

1178
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,400
Oh I don't know, CUTE!

1179
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,500
I don't like CUTE, I never did like CUTE,

1180
01:13:56,650 --> 01:14:01,000
Doesn't really go with my
whole big bad powerful magic guy thing, does it?!

1181
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,250
Deliver the punchline Tempest,
because this has gotta be a JOKE!

1182
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:23,700
Ugh, no!!

1183
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,450
Check out the light show!

1184
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:37,950
WOW!!

1185
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:43,300
Let's get this storm started!

1186
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,750
Ooh, hey, that's good, I should
trademark that.

1187
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:54,450
Not bad.

1188
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,650
Actually, kind of first rate!

1189
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,250
What else does it do?

1190
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:02,250
Your Excellency, you promised to
restore my horn, and give it even...

1191
01:15:02,251 --> 01:15:04,050
Dehdehdeh det... Okay, hang on...

1192
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,650
You gotta be kidding me!

1193
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,950
I can move the SUN!?

1194
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,300
AH HAH HAH! WHOA!

1195
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,250
Now THIS is what I'm TALKIN' about!

1196
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,200
HA HA!!

1197
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Time to play!

1198
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,350
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday!

1199
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:32,399
Day night, day night day, night day
night day night sunrise sunset...

1200
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,400
De de bup bup bup bah bah bah

1201
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:49,100
Uh, yeah.

1202
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:52,150
I got a delivery here
for a Mr. The Storm King.

1203
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,649
I was given explicit instructions to
bring...

1204
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,000
...THIS here cake to THIS here
Castle's throne room.

1205
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,250
All right then.

1206
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:11,649
Look here, could one of y'all go be a pal,
go tell your boss he's not getting his...

1207
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:15,099
“Congratulations on subduing
defenseless pastel ponies” cake?

1208
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,149
'Cause I don't want to be the one
responsible for the big guy missing...

1209
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,450
His special dessert, you know what
I'm sayin'?

1210
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,600
Thank you kindly fellas, I'mma be sure and put
a good word in for the both of y'all.

1211
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,700
Pinkie, quit lookin' so happy!
Y'ain't foolin' nopony!

1212
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,700
Oh, okay.

1213
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,100
Mmm, pie!

1214
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,400
Oh, hello cake.

1215
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,050
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

1216
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:07,650
Mmm. It's some like... gourmet
icing!

1217
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,800
Who puts eyeballs in filling?

1218
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,650
GUARDS!

1219
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,400
Uh oh... Plan B?

1220
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,800
The jig is up!

1221
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,600
Come on!!

1222
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,650
Gotcha!

1223
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:47,050
Lovely!

1224
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,450
Surprise!

1225
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,750
Double surprise!

1226
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,350
You seem tense. Do you wanna talk
about it?

1227
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:15,450
Head for the castle!
We'll hold them off!

1228
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:16,550
C'mon!

1229
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,400
Let it all out.

1230
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,050
FLUTTERSHY!!

1231
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,550
Oh, sorry, our time is up, buh bye!!

1232
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,150
Bye!

1233
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,350
Keep going!

1234
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,400
Shelly, Sheldon...

1235
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,550
I can't see!!

1236
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,200
Uh oh!

1237
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,300
Hey, ain't you a FIRE-BREATHING dragon?

1238
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,000
What?! How...?!

1239
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,599
It's... it's the magic of...

1240
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,750
Yeah yeah, friendship and flowers
and ponies and bleeeeh...

1241
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,850
I'm so totally over the cute pony thing!

1242
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,200
THIS ENDS NOW!

1243
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:34,750
Uh oh.

1244
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,600
YEAH!

1245
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,350
Move them hooves, ponies!

1246
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:05,450
You'd have to be traveling faster than
a speeding Pegasus to break through THAT wind!

1247
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,050
Excellent idea, Rainbow Dash!

1248
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:16,850
Now I truly am the Storm King!

1249
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:23,850
And the entire world will bow to my
va va va VOOM, BABY!

1250
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:28,049
Yes, yes, you are every bit as
powerful as I promised, sire.

1251
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:33,650
Now, restore my horn and I swear to
use my magic to serve you.

1252
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,300
Who cares about your dinky little
unicorn horn.

1253
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,300
But, we... we had an agreement...

1254
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,150
Get with the program.

1255
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,400
I USED you.

1256
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,550
It's kinda what I do

1257
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,800
Hold on!

1258
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,400
Why are you saving me?

1259
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,050
Because this is what friends do.

1260
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,500
Aww...

1261
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,400
...Isn't that just so sweet!

1262
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:30,800
Yeah.

1263
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:32,650
See ya.

1264
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,950
You sure about this?

1265
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,950
JUST DO IT!!!

1266
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,800
THANK YOU!!

1267
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:40,950
I'm excited!

1268
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,700
Who's excited?!

1269
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,200
AHH,
I've never been so excited!!!!!

1270
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,900
Bullseye!

1271
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:01,900
Pinkie!

1272
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:05,650
You all came back! I'm SO sorry! I
was wrong to...

1273
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,200
I'm sorry, too!

1274
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,849
Friends mess up sometimes but we never should...!

1275
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,750
Uh, make up later!
This isn't over!

1276
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,350
I've got to get control of it!

1277
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:37,400
Go! You got this, Twilight!

1278
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:39,350
No.

1279
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:40,850
We've got this!

1280
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,300
Together.

1281
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,650
WHEEE!!

1282
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:59,700
The staff belongs to ME!

1283
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,400
NO! That's MY staff!

1284
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:20,450
THE POWER IS MINE!!!

1285
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:21,950
NO!!!

1286
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:23,050

01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,900
Whoa

1299
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,200
I can't believe she did that!

1300
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,350
I can.

1301
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,250
Now what?

1302
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,200
Now...

1303
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:19,050
...we fix everything.

1304
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,650
Twilight!

1305
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,650
Princesses!

1306
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:18,650
Fillies and Gentlecolts!

1307
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,850
Get ready for a little...

1308
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,300
SONGBIRD SERENADE!

1309
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:35,750
And now to celebrate the fact that
we're all still here in one piece...

1310
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:41,600
Give it up for Princess Twilight
and her friends!

1311
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:44,450
All right! Way to go, guys!

1312
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:48,400
YEAH!! HEH HEH HEH HEH!

1313
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,700
♫ I know you, you're a special one ♫

1314
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:10,200
♫ Some see crazy, where I see love ♫

1315
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:16,400
♫ You fall so low,
but shoot so high ♫

1316
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:22,050
♫ Big dreamers shoot for open sky ♫

1317
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:28,350
♫ So much life in those
open eyes ♫

1318
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,249
♫ So much depth,
you look for the light ♫

1319
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,250
Ooooh!

1320
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,150
And, perfection!

1321
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:39,549
♫ But when your wounds open,
you will cry ♫

1322
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:40,550
Mom!

1323
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:45,650
♫ You'll cry out now
and you'll question why ♫

1324
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,500
You are so grounded.

1325
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:50,050
♫ I can see a rainbow ♫

1326
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:53,150
♫ In your tears as they fall on down ♫

1327
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:55,900
♫ I can see your soul grow ♫

1328
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:59,000
♫ Through the pain as they hit the ground ♫

1329
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:01,750
♫ I can see a rainbow ♫

1330
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,000
♫ In your tears as the sun comes out ♫

1331
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,800
♫ As the sun comes out... ♫

1332
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:30,000
That's one thing that never changes
around here.

1333
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,900
The party.

1334
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,400
Well...

1335
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:35,850
I hope you'll stay.

1336
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:39,100
More friends are definitely merrier.

1337
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:41,550
But, um...

1338
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,950
My horn?

1339
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:45,750
You know,

1340
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,800
Your horn is pretty powerful,

1341
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,550
Just like the pony it
belongs to.

1342
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:58,499
I did tell you I wanted to show
everypony in Equestria

1343
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,750
What I could do, right?

1344
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,550
♫ I can see a rainbow ♫

01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:21,150
Nice touch, Tempest.

1349
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,050
Actually, that's not my real name...

1350
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,000
Oooooooo!! What is it?!

1351
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,350
It's Fizzlepop Berrytwist.

1352
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:34,950
OKAY!

1353
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,500
THAT IS

1354
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:37,250
THE MOST AWESOME NAME...

1355
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:39,050

01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:54,000
♫ Seeking boundaries to break ♫

1414
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:56,250
♫ Let's forget the ones we've made ♫

1415
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:02,950
♫ So we carry on,
don't let good things pass us by ♫

1416
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,350
♫ The time we're gone will be the

01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:14,000
♫ We might know we can't win ♫

1420
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,200
♫ But we're dumb enough to try ♫

1421
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,200
♫ We're going, there's no maybe ♫

1422
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,650
♫ That's why they call us crazy ♫

1423
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:24,899
♫ And we'll say if anybody asks us ♫

1424
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,450
♫ Hey, where you gonna go ♫

1425
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,700
♫ We're off to see the world ♫

1426
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:31,950
♫ We don't need to know ♫

1427
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,400
♫ Hey, where you gonna go ♫

1428
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,650
♫ We're off to see the world ♫

1429
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:40,850
♫ We don't need to know ♫

1430
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:44,000
♫ So go tell 'em we won't stop ♫

1431
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:46,250
♫ We know they can't change us ♫

1432
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,500
♫ We're gonna go way off the map ♫

1433
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,899
♫ To get ourselves back on the track ♫

1434
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,950
♫ Go tell 'em we won't stop ♫

1435
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:55,200
♫ We know they can't change us ♫

1436
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,699
♫ No need to worry so much ♫

1437
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,900
♫ We do whatever we want ♫

1438
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:03,350
♫ Hey, where you gonna go ♫

1439
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,600
♫ We're off to see the world ♫

1440
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,750
♫ We don't need to know ♫

1441
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:12,300
♫ Hey, where you gonna go ♫

1442
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,500
♫ We're off to see the world ♫

1443
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,750
♫ We don't need to know ♫
