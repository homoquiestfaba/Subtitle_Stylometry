1
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:31,018
-Someone's sitting there.

2
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:31,818
-You're very observant.

3
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,462
-Where have you been?

4
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,165
-Out and about.

5
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,934
-What's her name?

6
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,504
-Oh, Erica.

7
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,640
You know there's only you.

8
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,042
-You're funny.

9
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,544
I saw you walking
with a woman outside.

10
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,813
You have very good
taste in women, Stefan.

11
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:08,722
-Well, that is a
complement to us both.

12
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,523
-Thank you.

13
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,740
-Ugh.

14
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,747
-Nice dress.

15
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,548
-Thank you.

16
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,519
-You're new here.

17
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,021
-It's the first
time I've been here.

18
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,368
-Do you mind?

19
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,169
I'm dying.

20
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,339
-There you go.

21
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,340
-You know Stefan?

22
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,842
-I just met him.

23
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:02,809
-You should be flattered.

24
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,011
He rarely talks to anyone.

25
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:05,812
-Oh.

26
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,818
Are those implants?

27
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,019
-Please.

28
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,522
I'm having the
operation next month.

29
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,891
-Oh.

30
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,260
-Tissue?

31
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,063
-It was either that
or grapefruits.

32
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,364
-You are new.

33
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,333
-Yes.

34
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,803
-Um, would you?

35
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,805
-There you go.

36
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,773
-Ah.

37
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,474
You have a little smudge there.

38
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,113
-It's tough being a woman.

39
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,815
-It's murder.

40
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,151
-You guys get me out of
bed this time of night,

41
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,585
it better be one of mine.

42
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,621
-See for yourself.

43
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,123
Mind you, don't
stand in the blood.

44
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,693
Young, cute, and unzipped
like an overnight bag.

45
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,528
-[laugh]

46
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,963
-And what the fuck is so funny?

47
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,233
-Sure looks like one of his.

48
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,103
-Well, the papers will
give him one by morning.

49
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,939
Did you find anything yet?

50
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,940
Get me a cup of coffee.

51
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,708
Get all these
spectators out of here.

52
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,645
Get them back-- way back.

53
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,445
-Fuck.

54
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,251
-We're going to start back
there and work our way up.

55
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,519
-All right.

56
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,754
-Inch by inch.

57
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,555
-OK.

58
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,760
-What's with him?

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,396
-That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

60
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,230
See you later, Joe.

61
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,031
-OK.

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,575
-Hello Mrs. Morris.

63
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,375
-Hello Mr. Keece.

64
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,016
-Would you like
to see my tattoo?

65
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,686
-I've already seen it.

66
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,654
-Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,089
[laugh] OK.

68
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,360
Goodnight.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,161
-Night.

70
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,051
MALE SPEAKER (ON
TAPE): That's my man.

71
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,920
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Oh, no.
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Yes.

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,587
Why?

73
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,655
What did you think?

74
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,823
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE):
I am so depressed.

75
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,757
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Why?

76
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,758
-Because I want you, darling.

77
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,759
-Jamie, you never had a--

78
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,070
-Hi.

79
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,040
-Hi.

80
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,181
How did it go?

81
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:01,981
-Good.

82
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,782
Take a look.

83
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:07,887
-Hmm.

84
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,928
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Well
I don't need you anymore.

85
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,029
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Why?
What did I ever do to you?

86
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,397
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE):
Well you wouldn't

87
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,398
sit in the jacuzzi with me.

88
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,199
You were--

89
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,471
-Hey.

90
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,106
Um, come to bed.

91
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,307
-No.

92
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,876
-I don't want you yawning
tomorrow at the picnic.

93
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,845
-Picnic?

94
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,645
OK.

95
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,114
Let me save this.

96
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:34,914
-OK.

97
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,815
-I'll be right there.

98
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,389
Good.

99
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,189
Good.

100
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,566
(FEMALE VOICE) Would you
like for me to strip for you?

101
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,242
This was easier getting on.

102
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,243
-It's nice.

103
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:07,046
I don't recognize any of it.

104
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,516
-You didn't have the
style I was looking for.

105
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,316
-Oh.

106
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,420
Well, nor the size, I hope.

107
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,556
So who's your outfitter?

108
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,590
-Armani.

109
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,391
-Ah.

110
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,293
You're not cheap.

111
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,262
[laugh]

112
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,764
-The Salvation Armani.

113
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,166
The stockings are yours.

114
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,700
I put a hole in mine.

115
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,501
Ahh.

116
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,370
-Let me get that.

117
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,805
-Oh.

118
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,106
Is this turning you on?

119
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,074
-[laugh]

120
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:34,874
-Huh?

121
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,143
Is it turning you on?

122
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,111
-Only the stockings are mine?

123
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,481
-Oh.

124
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,549
I used a dab of your perfume.

125
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,483
-Mhm.

126
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,717
Do you know how
expensive that is?

127
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,518
-No.

128
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,392
Mmm.

129
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,232
-You really only
need a little bit.

130
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:04,504
Right-- right there.

131
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,473
-Oh.

132
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,209
-Definitely here.

133
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,777
-Oh.

134
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,313
-Here.

135
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,514
-Oh.

136
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,783
-And here.

137
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,817
-Yeah, definitely there.

138
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,495
[laugh]

139
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,495
Good morning.

140
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:05,698
OK.

141
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,400
Wake up, sleepy head.

142
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,201
-OK.

143
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,537
[laugh] Ah!

144
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,638
-Wake up.

145
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,438
Get up.

146
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,976
-Ugh.

147
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,680
-Come on, come on.

148
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,481
-Ah.

149
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,296
-Aren't you going
to take a shower?

150
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,197
-Why?

151
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,500
-I don't believe it.

152
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,301
-What?

153
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,036
-The picnic.

154
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,071
-The picnic's not
until this afternoon.

155
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,341
-It is the afternoon.

156
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,843
-Oh.

157
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,011
OK.

158
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,547
Let me get this stuff down
while it's still fresh.

159
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,750
That was beautiful last night.

160
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,918
That was so amazing.

161
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,719
-Nelson--

162
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,621
-Why don't you go ahead?

163
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,423
I'll meet you there.

164
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,158
-What do you mean
you'll meet me there?

165
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,026
This picnic is for us?

166
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,628
My parents want to meet you.

167
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,429
-I'm coming.

168
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,031
Did I say I wasn't coming?

169
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,600
You're obsessed.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,601
-I'm a journalist.

171
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,069
This is what I do for a living.

172
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,070
-Well it's not normal.

173
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,271
It's scary.

174
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,672
-It's research.

175
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,975
-It's like when you wrote
that article on the drunks.

176
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,376
-Alcoholics.

177
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,646
-You ended up
spending three months

178
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,214
crawling the walls
in withdrawal.

179
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,951
What's it going to
be next time, Nelson?

180
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,021
-That's a lousy attitude.

181
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,756
-You know, why don't
you write an article

182
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,825
through the eyes
of Nelson Keece?

183
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,294
I sure would like to read it.

184
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,462
-No, Jules.

185
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,730
-You know, the
next thing I know,

186
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,999
you're going to be writing
an article about suicides.

187
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,600
And the first I'll
hear about it is

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,036
you cruising past
the kitchen window.

189
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,872
-It'd be kind of hard
to finish the story.

190
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,906
-Yeah?

191
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,174
Well, just take your
computer with you

192
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,343
and write it on the way down.

193
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,278
-That's a good one.

194
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,548
I haven't sold anything
in eight months--

195
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,052
not since the piece
about alcoholics.

196
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,420
Eight months, honey.

197
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,322
I'm broke.

198
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,123
I need another hit.

199
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,228
-Who's been paying the
bills in the meantime?

200
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,033
-Well, you have.

201
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,769
I knew you'd say that.

202
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,569
-I'll see you later.

203
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:58,938
-Nice dress.

204
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,051
-I bet you'd never guess
where I've seen you before.

205
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,228
-So how'd you know my name?

206
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,732
-I've been part of your
audience this past week.

207
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,468
It's Maria Sanchez, right?

208
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,368
-Oh.

209
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,236
You were in court.

210
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,471
-Yes.

211
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,908
I'm just an observer-- a
frustrated lawyer, actually.

212
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,878
I've seen many lawyers, and
you're quite impressive.

213
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:45,985
Ah!

214
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,054
So much for the great weather!

215
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,021
Ahh!

216
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:49,822
-Ah!

217
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,957
-Let's duck in here.

218
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,995
Did they forecast
rain for today?

219
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:56,796
-I don't know.

220
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,471
-Sorry.

221
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,076
It was-- it was overly
ambitious of me.

222
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,477
-It's OK.

223
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:24,023
I-- I've-- I don't normally walk
into alleyways with strangers.

224
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,525
-Uh-huh.

225
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:35,568
Neither do I.

226
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:41,507
Neither do I.

227
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,509
-Um, do you live near here or?

228
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,981
-I saw you in the courtroom.

229
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,118
You dominated it.

230
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,921
Where do you get such power?

231
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,324
-Um, [uncomfortable laugh]
don't.

232
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,067
-Your skin is so soft.

233
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,535
-Don't.

234
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,905
-I knew it would be.

235
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,906
-Oh.

236
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,874
You're moving too fast.

237
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:15,675
Show me your power.

238
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,913
Where do you get such power?

239
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,148
-What are you talking about?

240
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:22,949
Don't.

241
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,585
-Show me your power, Maria.

242
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,385
That's what I need.

243
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,860
Where do you get such power?

244
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,667
-Oh, Jesus.

245
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,285
Hello, police.

246
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,553
I just recorded murder.

247
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,687
Please listen.

248
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,455
Ah!

249
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,263
-Who are you?

250
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,698
-Hey, hey, hey.

251
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,633
What's your problem, man?

252
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,433
-What?

253
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,704
-Are you all right, man?

254
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,505
-You OK?

255
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,147
-I could tell from here
that that was him again.

256
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,419
You know, if we don't get
a break with this guy soon,

257
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,055
man, the press is going to
have a field day with us.

258
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,957
-What do you care what
the press has to say?

259
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:18,958
-It's not that I care.

260
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,726
It's just my first
high profile case.

261
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,063
I just want it to go well,
if that's all right with you.

262
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,232
-Remember Jack the Ripper?

263
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,666
-Yeah.

264
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,601
-Well, I never caught him.

265
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,141
Let's just take a look around
and see what we can find.

266
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:35,941
-All right.

267
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,456
-Officer.

268
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,059
Officer.

269
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,427
-Sir will you sign this?

270
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,227
-Hey!

271
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:08,707
-I know you.

272
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,542
Where do I know you from?

273
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,577
-We met in a club last night.

274
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,611
My name is Nelson Keece.

275
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,479
I'm a journalist.

276
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,580
-A journalist.
How interesting.

277
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,414
What do you write about?

278
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,215
-Unusual situations.

279
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,820
-Is this unusual enough for you?

280
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,758
-Now.

281
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,193
Who the fuck are you?

282
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,608
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE):
This is what I need.

283
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,078
This is what I want.

284
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,047
Where do you get such power?

285
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,065
Are you following me?

286
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,467
-I'm doing a story
on transvestites.

287
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,404
I saw you in the park with
that girl, so I followed you.

288
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:25,918
-Are you a good writer?

289
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,824
-I won an award last year.

290
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,634
-You want to write about me?

291
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,239
I'd like that.

292
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:51,210
-You're not just saying that
to make me feel good, are you?

293
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,144
-No.

294
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:52,945
I'd really like that.

295
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,716
-I mean, you'll interview
me and everything?

296
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,186
-Yes.

297
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,054
-Good.

298
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,989
Good.

299
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,624
Then we have a deal?

300
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,425
-Yeah.

301
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,865
-Then let's seal it in blood.

302
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:13,666
-Ah.

303
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,074
Ooh.

304
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,063
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE):
It's what I want.

305
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,565
Where do you get such power?

306
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,864
-So.

307
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:52,731
What happened?

308
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,834
Where were you?

309
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,404
-It doesn't matter.

310
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,707
-It doesn't matter.

311
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:04,176
What happened to your hand?

312
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,477
-I don't want to
talk about it now.

313
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:11,216
-Well, do you think you could
at least to explain to me

314
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,785
why you didn't show
up at the picnic?

315
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,657
Fucking Nelson, talk to me.

316
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,458
Be a man.

317
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,225
Tell me what happened.

318
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,633
-I'll tell you what happened.

319
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,936
I saw a murder.

320
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,371
That's what happened.

321
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,473
I almost got killed and
you want to sit here

322
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,874
and talk about a fucking picnic.

323
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,887
-Juliette.

324
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:49,688
Wait.

325
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:57,996
Come here!

326
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,431
Come here.

327
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,633
Juliette, you don't understand.

328
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:06,372
Juliette-- Juliette,
where are you going?

329
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:07,339
-Beautiful girl.

330
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,717
Why is she leaving you?

331
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,186
-It's a long story.

332
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,655
-It's not because
of us, is it Nelson?

333
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,623
-Us?

334
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,557
No.

335
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,893
She doesn't know
anything about us.

336
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:28,961
-Well, that's just as well.

337
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,931
I'm ready.

338
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,534
-Ready for work?

339
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,137
-Our interview.

340
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,104
-Now?

341
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,172
-Yes.

342
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,107
I have so much to tell you.

343
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:45,010
Let's go inside.

344
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,179
-Does it have to be tonight?

345
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:47,980
I'm not prepared.

346
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:55,821
-We had an agreement, Nelson.

347
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:59,792
-I know we do, but I need a
little more time to prepare.

348
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,298
-So you would know which
questions to ask me?

349
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,099
-Ah.

350
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,634
Exactly.

351
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,770
-Ah, I see.

352
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,771
Hmm.

353
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,607
How about tomorrow then?

354
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,309
-Uh, tomorrow would be better.

355
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,084
-Nelson, can I hear
the tape again?

356
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,021
-It's upstairs and I've
just started working on it.

357
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,893
-I'm not being too pushy, am I?

358
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:35,694
-No.

359
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,166
-Tomorrow, then.

360
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:46,638
-Ahh.

361
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,950
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): 911 emergency.

362
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,353
-Police-- I need to
talk to someone about

363
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,221
the girl who was
murdered last night.

364
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,456
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Which one?

365
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,625
-Which one?

366
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,927
The girl in the alleyway
off Market Street.

367
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,095
Her name was Maria.

368
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,366
I got it on tape.

369
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,600
I recorded the whole thing.

370
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:58,644
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Sir?

371
00:27:58,644 --> 00:27:59,444
Hello?

372
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,245
Hello?

373
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,332
-Hello.

374
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,466
-Do you need some help, sir?

375
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,801
Yes, sir, I do.

376
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,536
I need to talk to someone
about the murder with the girl

377
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,371
in the alleyway
of Market Street.

378
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,372
-Over there.

379
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,407
Take a seat and
someone will see you.

380
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,311
-Over there?

381
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:55,968
Excuse me.
-Hey, take a seat, man.

382
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,269
We'll get to you in a second.

383
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,204
-I need to talk to someone
about the murder last night.

384
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,540
-Your turn is when you get
to that end of the line.

385
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,275
-I have it on tape.

386
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,276
-Great.

387
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,711
We'll all sit
together and watch it.

388
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:06,511
-No, no.

389
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,346
It's not a videotape.

390
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,350
This is crazy.

391
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,481
-Oh, no.

392
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:47,886
[laugh] What is that
on your head, bro?

393
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,688
-It's what they call a hat.

394
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,990
-Damn! [laugh]

395
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,191
-My favorite hat.

396
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,559
-I've never seen the hat before.

397
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,066
You look like you belong in
"The Grapes of Wrath." [laugh]

398
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:01,867
-OK, Frenchie.

399
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,770
Why don't you just do your work?

400
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,806
-I can't get to work with you
wearing that ugly ass hat.

401
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,607
All right.

402
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,941
Let's see what we got here.

403
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,980
Forensics, statements, evidence
found in the alleyway, a uh,

404
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,616
a first unit report,
station calls,

405
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,918
and related 911 calls, man.

406
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,186
There's nothing that
leaps out at you.

407
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,191
-Well, that's why they
call us detectives.

408
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,969
Did you always want
to be a cop, Laroue?

409
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:40,839
-OK.

410
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,140
Here we go.

411
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,176
Yo, you know, I'm
getting really tired

412
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,411
of the way you talk to me, man.

413
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,779
-I just asked you
a simple question.

414
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,914
-No, man.

415
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:49,881
It's not that you asked
me a simple question.

416
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,683
It's the way you asked me.

417
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,051
You're always talking
down to me, Haynes.

418
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:53,852
Why?

419
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,599
-What is it?

420
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,935
Some of the guys
think-- fuck it.

421
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:10,736
I think--

422
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:11,536
-OK.

423
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,904
I know where you're going.

424
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,874
Everybody thinks I'm taking
this case too personally, right?

425
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,942
-Something like that.

426
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,343
-That I shouldn't
even be on it, right?

427
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,718
-I'll tell you a little story.

428
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,888
My, uh, daughter, 10
years ago, kidnapped

429
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:35,627
and killed-- 10 years ago.

430
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,335
They never caught the guy.

431
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,870
He disappeared, got away.

432
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,177
You think I'm taking
it personally?

433
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,750
I don't think that this is
the same guy, all right?

434
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,018
I don't believe it.

435
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,621
So put your mind at ease.

436
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,490
I want to catch this son of
a bitch as bad as any of you

437
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,392
guys.

438
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,529
But when we get him,
I want to personally

439
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,596
chop his fucking head off.

440
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,397
OK?

441
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,269
-Haynes.

442
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,403
-Yeah.

443
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:22,007
-This 911 call came in
about 30 minutes ago.

444
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,875
The guy knew the victim's name.

445
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,988
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): 911 emergency.

446
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,257
KEECE (ON PHONE): Poliec--
I need to talk to someone

447
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,293
about the girl who was
murdered last night.

448
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,594
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Which one?

449
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,663
KEECE (ON PHONE): Which one?

450
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,199
The girl in the alleyway
off Market Street.

451
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,300
Her name was Maria.

452
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,204
I got it on tape.

453
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,939
I recorded the whole thing.

454
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,712
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE): Sir?

455
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,947
Hello?

456
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:02,881
Hello?

457
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:03,982
-Oh, shit.
He's in the corridor.

458
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,083
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON PHONE): Hello?

459
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,033
-You see him?

460
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:28,673
-Excuse me.

461
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,919
-Bro, give me back 21.

462
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:41,720
-21?

463
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,130
-Here.

464
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,338
MALE SPEAKER (ON
TAPE): So I saw you.

465
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,741
You had the leather
cock piece on.

466
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,442
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE):
Baby, if I wasn't taken,

467
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,744
I'd want all of you.

468
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,746
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Oh,
I am so available for you.

469
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:08,713
MALE SPEAKER (ON TAPE): Yeah?

470
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,516
You were--

471
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,685
-Take this down to the
lab with that 911 tape.

472
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,324
Laroue.

473
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,258
-Yeah.

474
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,927
-What did he look like?

475
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:25,630
-Kind of a early 40s, light
features, about 180 pounds.

476
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,799
-Before you forget, put
his face in the computer

477
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,501
and see if you can get a match.

478
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,836
-Procedure.

479
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:32,804
Yeah, I know.

480
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,914
-Hello?

481
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,349
-Nelson, it's me.

482
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,054
-Stefan.

483
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,122
-I've had an idea, Nelson.

484
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,824
-What's that?

485
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,659
-There's something
you should see?

486
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,860
-What's that?

487
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,429
-How I work.

488
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,898
Can you meet me at the
corner of Third and Cherokee

489
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,299
in 20 minutes?

490
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,803
-Cherokee and Third.

491
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:05,603
-Yes.

492
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,172
-There's a newsstand there.

493
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,573
I know it's short notice, but--

494
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,376
-Stefan.

495
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,577
-Yes, Nelson?

496
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,381
-There's something I have
to make clear to you.

497
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,284
-OK.

498
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:23,321
-While I'm writing
this story on you, uh--

499
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,789
-Just go ahead and
say it, Nelson.

500
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,562
-I want you to stop killing.

501
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,396
-Ahh.

502
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:34,099
This is not about killing.

503
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:37,802
This is about the pursuit.

504
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,071
-So we understand each other?

505
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,239
-Absolutely.

506
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,040
-I'll be there.

507
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,988
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Police department.

508
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,156
May I help you?

509
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:58,957
Hello?

510
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,342
[phone ringing]

511
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,410
JULIETTE (ON RECORDING): Hi.

512
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,781
Leave a message for
Nelson or Juliette.

513
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:23,815
JULETTE (ON PHONE): Hey, Nelson.

514
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,617
It's me.

515
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:29,087
Do you think you could set aside
your work for maybe an hour

516
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,389
and come and meet me
at the lounge tonight?

517
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,727
Uh, I really think
we should talk.

518
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:36,528
OK.

519
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,328
Bye.

520
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,563
-Excuse me.

521
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,601
Have you seen a young
lady come in here

522
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,037
with the curly brown hair?

523
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,540
-Um, I think she
went down that aisle.

524
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:57,135
-Have you read the
Oxford New Press version?

525
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,138
-Uh, no.

526
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,406
I haven't.

527
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,676
-It's Lori, isn't it?

528
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,679
-How do you know my name?

529
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,181
-Your name tag.

530
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,316
-Yeah.

531
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:12,083
I'm not wearing it.

532
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,724
-You work at the
newsstand, right?

533
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,226
-I don't remember you.

534
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,427
Should I?

535
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,529
-Well, that's just great.

536
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,298
I buy my newspaper
there every day.

537
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:32,103
Obviously I didn't make such
a good impression, then.

538
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,137
-I'm sorry.

539
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,206
I see a lot of people, you know?

540
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,432
-You have beautiful hair.

541
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,233
-Hey.

542
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,870
I don't like being touched, OK?

543
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,038
-I'm sorry.
Actually just waiting--

544
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:07,839
-Excuse me.

545
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,773
---for a friend.

546
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,774
-Hey!

547
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,575
Hey, oww.

548
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:22,453
-Sometimes I'm a little
impulsive for my own good.

549
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,254
-Oh my god.

550
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:50,775
-Look who's here.

551
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,714
-I'll have a double
whiskey, please.

552
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,618
-He looks terrible.

553
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,093
-So when did you
start drinking again?

554
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,561
-Just now.

555
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,163
-Uh, Nelson, we need to talk.

556
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,637
-One more, please.

557
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,105
-Nelson, please don't.

558
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,474
If you're just going to get
smashed, I'm going to leave.

559
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,375
Why did you want to see me?

560
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,813
-Well, I don't want
to drag this out,

561
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:33,184
but I really think we
need some time apart.

562
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:33,985
-Yeah.

563
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,055
There's something
I have to tell you.

564
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,635
-What?

565
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,240
-You look beautiful tonight.

566
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,041
-Oh, Nelson.

567
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,679
-I'm drowning.

568
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,613
That's what.

569
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,414
I'm drowning.

570
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,721
I can't tell when
you're serious anymore.

571
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,590
Well, I'm serious
when I say I love you.

572
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,465
-You know, Nelson, you can't
possibly know what love is.

573
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,345
-Hey.

574
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:37,982
What you doing?

575
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,485
-Oh, just playing around.

576
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,820
Working on something.

577
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,788
-Yeah?

578
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,355
Hey.

579
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:44,856
You [inaudible]?

580
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:48,993
-No.

581
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,463
Uh, he's Ivan.

582
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,931
-There you go, boy.

583
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,605
-What we got going?

584
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:12,683
That was him, yeah?

585
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,990
-Alleyway killer.

586
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,391
-Hold on, now.

587
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,360
If he's the killer, why would
he come to a police precinct?

588
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,594
And then why does
he have it on tape?

589
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,598
-I don't know.

590
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,368
A lot of unanswered questions.

591
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:33,170
-I'll tell you one thing.

592
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,073
I've seen this guy
somewhere before.

593
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:36,874
-Yeah?

594
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:37,808
-Yeah.

595
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,578
I can't remember
where, but I know

596
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:44,315
I've seen him somewhere--
sometime before the alley.

597
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,383
-Hmm.

598
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,852
Well, I'm going to
take this to the press.

599
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,121
They'll have his face on
the front page by morning.

600
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,557
-Oh no you're not.

601
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:55,092
If you do that, he's
going to go underground.

602
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,494
-What are you
talking about, man?

603
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,728
Somebody out there
has seen this guy.

604
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:58,796
We could save a life.

605
00:44:58,796 --> 00:44:59,597
-Yeah.

606
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:00,731
We could lose one, too.

607
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,633
-How?

608
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,169
-That's what happened
to my daughter's killer.

609
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:09,006
He saw his fucking face in
the paper and he disappeared.

610
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,541
I'm not going to let
that happen again.

611
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,342
You understand?

612
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:12,577
-Yeah, man.

613
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:13,711
But this is not your
daughter's killer, all right?

614
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,046
You said so yourself.

615
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,314
Now you've got to
let this go, Haynes.

616
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,381
We've got to get this out there.

617
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,359
-All right, man.

618
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,829
If we're going to play God, I'll
give you one more dead lady.

619
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,097
And then that
picture goes public.

620
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:33,898
It has to.

621
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:41,872
-If there's going to be any
more victims, let it be me.

622
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,606
-Boo.

623
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,643
-God.

624
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,545
How did you get in here?

625
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,982
-Where there's a
will there's a way.

626
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:02,687
Nelson, I came to apologize.

627
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,755
-For what?

628
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:08,993
-We had an agreement and
I betrayed your trust.

629
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:16,434
It was for you, Nelson--
I mean the story.

630
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,234
-I understand.

631
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,371
-Thank you.

632
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,086
-I'm ready.

633
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,187
You can ask me anything.

634
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,458
-I'm going to record this.

635
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,331
-Do you like being a
journalist, Nelson?

636
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,534
-Yeah, I do.

637
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,803
-You're a people
person, aren't you?

638
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,905
-I am, too.

639
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,608
I think that's why
we get along so well.

640
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,409
-Talk.

641
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:07,051
-Well, aren't you going
to ask me any questions?

642
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,619
-Tell me about the first one.

643
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,394
-I was 17.

644
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,397
-And how old was she?

645
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,197
-35.

646
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:25,669
And how did it happen?

647
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,937
-We were making love.

648
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,878
She found me amusing.

649
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,379
-And you didn't like that?

650
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:39,150
-No.

651
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,018
I didn't like that.

652
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:44,155
-But you enjoyed killing her.

653
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:48,492
-There's a moment when
you look into her eyes

654
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:54,131
and the last bit of
breath leaves her body.

655
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,299
-How does that make you feel?

656
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,139
-Like a god.

657
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,340
Like a god.

658
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,811
-And that feeling makes
you want to kill again.

659
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,613
-Well, there's no rush.

660
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,117
The hunt is as
important as the kill.

661
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,753
-What do you feel
when it's all over?

662
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:16,554
-Euphoria.

663
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,859
-Do you feel depressed?

664
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:23,227
-No.

665
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:26,664
-Do you ever feel any shame?

666
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:27,464
-No.

667
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,532
Never.

668
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:32,002
-Do you have any
feelings for the victims?

669
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,338
-Love.

670
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,173
I loved every one of them.

671
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:36,974
-Ah.

672
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:45,616
How many women have you killed?

673
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,718
-How many women have
you make love to?

674
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,519
-Jesus.

675
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:56,393
Jesus.

676
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,709
-Why are you judging me?

677
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:12,509
-I'm not.

678
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,550
-Did you judge those other
people you wrote about?

679
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,018
-No.

680
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:24,121
-Then why are you judging me?

681
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,059
-I'm trying to understand you.

682
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:38,736
-What you understand
is only what you see.

683
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:46,544
You look down on me,
and you see a fool.

684
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:52,182
You look up at me,
and you see a god.

685
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:57,922
Look straight into my eyes
and you will see yourself.

686
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:08,766
Put your shoes on.

687
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,640
-OK.

688
00:51:28,352 --> 00:51:29,687
-Let's go, Nelson.

689
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,256
Let's go.

690
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,757
What's taking so long?

691
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,167
-Where are we going?

692
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:47,137
-There's someone I'd like you
to meet-- an old friend of mine.

693
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,107
-Why?

694
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,077
-Perhaps this person
will enlighten you

695
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:56,880
and you'll understand
where this is all going.

696
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,681
-Yeah.

697
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,850
Where what is all going?

698
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,452
-The story, Nelson.

699
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,252
The story.

700
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,733
-Knock on the door.

701
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:16,533
Go ahead.

702
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:30,481
-Stefan, darling, you're early.

703
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,782
Come on in.

704
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:32,583
How about your friend?

705
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:46,663
Have we met?

706
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:49,700
-No.

707
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:56,607
-You look familiar.

708
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:57,641
What's your name?

709
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,643
-Nelson.

710
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,444
-Meet Eric.

711
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:04,415
-Eric.

712
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:05,382
Nice to meet you.

713
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,617
-Nelson.

714
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,586
What a cute name.

715
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:13,624
Why don't you sit down and
make yourself comfortable.

716
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,493
Would you like a drink,
Nelson, or don't you drink?

717
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,294
-Yes.

718
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,829
Yes, I don't drink.

719
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:23,267
And no, uh, I
don't need a drink.

720
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:27,004
-Well, if you don't mind,
I'm going to have one.

721
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,489
Did you see that?

722
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,295
Isn't this the girl
I saw you with?

723
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,464
-Yes.

724
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:54,832
Poor girl.

725
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,834
-Stefan, tell me you had
nothing to do with it.

726
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,072
-Eric.

727
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,676
-Whew.

728
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:06,477
I feel better.

729
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:14,718
Well, I suppose you don't
talk much either, do you?

730
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,186
Is this the one that
you told me about?

731
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:16,987
-Told him what?

732
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,759
-What'd he tell you about me?

733
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,560
-Nothing.

734
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,939
-I think I know what
this little party needs.

735
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,040
I'll just be a minute.

736
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:45,215
-Isn't this cozy?

737
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,722
This is a new
experience for me too.

738
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,196
-OK.

739
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:13,744
-Ahh.

740
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:18,782
[laugh] [claps]
Nelson, meet Erica.

741
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:36,233
-Now, isn't this better?

742
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,602
-Hello, Erica.

743
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:41,805
-Ah, you have to
forgive him, Erica.

744
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:45,909
Nelson here is
somewhat of a novice.

745
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,045
-Oh.

746
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:48,845
Oh, come on.

747
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,480
Loosen up.

748
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,548
Look.

749
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:55,118
Why don't you just
sit and watch and then

750
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,187
join in when you feel like it?

751
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,323
Would that be OK, Stefan?

752
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,123
-Absolutely.

753
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,163
Isn't she special?

754
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:10,567
What she lacks in quality she
makes up for in convenience.

755
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,072
-What does he mean?

756
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,444
-You said you didn't do men.

757
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:23,814
-But take a look, Nelson.

758
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,148
Does this look
like a man to you?

759
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,521
-[inaudible].

760
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,990
Get out of here.

761
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,458
-What are you going to do?

762
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,594
-I said get out of here.

763
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:38,395
-Ah.

764
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:41,865
-No!

765
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,271
-Ah!

766
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:48,305
-Don't you move.

767
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:49,106
Don't you move.

768
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,375
Shut your mouth, bitch.

769
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:52,342
Don't you move.

770
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:53,343
-OK.

771
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,144
-Let's do this.

772
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,979
You want to write a story?

773
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,415
Look here!

774
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,383
-Ah!

775
00:56:59,383 --> 00:56:59,883
-No.

776
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,884
No.

777
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,552
-Give me your hand
and let's do this.

778
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:03,353
-No.

779
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:04,688
-Let's do this together.

780
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,390
Don't you let me down.

781
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,190
Come on.

782
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,191
Give me you hand.

783
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,160
-No!

784
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,161
-One, two--

785
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,663
-Stop it.

786
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:17,134
-[cackles]

787
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:31,148
[groans]

788
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:39,489
[groans]

789
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:44,027
-A small cassette, a collection
of gay conversations.

790
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:48,098
They're all in the same club,
no clue as to which club.

791
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,503
Got a partial print,
but not enough

792
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,472
for the computer
to find a match.

793
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,012
Any luck on that picture yet?

794
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:03,180
-Nope.

795
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:03,980
-That's good.

796
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,984
Oh.

797
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,987
There's, uh-- there's one
knife homicide tonight.

798
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,256
A transvestite.

799
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,759
The knife work was sloppy.

800
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:19,763
Forensics think there
were two people involved

801
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:21,631
on account of the
fact that there

802
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,834
was a little fight
after the killing.

803
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,838
-[laugh]

804
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,706
-One left through the
window, the other just

805
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,775
walked right out the front door.

806
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:32,576
-Ahh.

807
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,382
-We gotta get that
picture out, Haynes.

808
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,020
-Is God going back on his word?

809
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,357
Don't I have one dead lady left?

810
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,425
-No, man.

811
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,826
I can't do it.

812
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,828
The next thing it's going to be
us on the front fucking page.

813
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:57,868
-OK.

814
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:02,305
-Are you listening, man?

815
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,274
-Uh huh.

816
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:07,244
MALE SPEAKER: Officer.

817
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,712
-Yeah.

818
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:17,687
Now I know where I saw him
before-- in a magazine article

819
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,856
about a year ago.

820
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,293
That guy got busted for
being drunk and disorderly,

821
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,161
a couple of times.

822
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:32,402
About a week later, he
wrote an article about it.

823
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,905
He was pretty hard
on the department.

824
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:40,544
He said that we were,
uh, cruel and insensitive

825
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:41,511
to a medical condition.

826
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:51,588
He wanted to, uh, know what
it was like to be a drunk,

827
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,756
so he became one.

828
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,429
That's the guy I
saw in the alleyway.

829
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,667
He had a small tape
recorder with him.

830
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,002
-So what he'd do now?

831
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,270
-Nothing.

832
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,905
-Haynes.

833
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,507
-We just want to talk to
him for a little while.

834
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:11,508
-Yeah.

835
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,275
I bet he did something
weird, right?

836
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,109
-What are you doing, man?

837
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,311
We don't have a warrant.

838
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,713
Anything we turn over is
going to be inadmissible.

839
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,248
-What makes you say that?

840
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:19,382
-Well, I saw him
the other night.

841
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,051
He was wearing a dress.

842
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,052
-A dress? [laugh]

843
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:22,552
-Yeah.
I swear.

844
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,620
A black one.

845
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,022
With the long sleeves,
lace, and sequins.

846
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,123
It was very nice.

847
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,458
-Really?

848
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,093
-I guess it's better than
coming home drunk every night.

849
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,127
Right?
-Yeah.

850
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:31,928
-Yeah.

851
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,230
I put a stop to that.

852
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,098
He used to come home at 3:00
AM in the morning singing

853
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,868
at the top of his lungs and
peeing all over the stairs.

854
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:38,902
Can you imagine?

855
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:40,837
-I'd rather not.

856
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,805
-Yeah.

857
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,205
Oh.

858
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:42,772
Oh.

859
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,573
Here it is.

860
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,709
-You got it?

861
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:48,612
Terrific.

862
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:49,913
-You just making up
your own rules now?

863
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:51,648
That's how we doing this?

864
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,784
-Go back to the car
and get a donut.

865
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:55,585
-Fuck you, man.

866
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:01,925
-He's new.

867
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:02,726
-Ahh.

868
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,572
-Scoot over to the precinct.

869
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:56,873
About an hour.

870
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:57,774
All right.

871
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,509
Check this out.

872
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,511
You know that transvestite
that got knifed last night?

873
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,513
Forensics only found
one set of prints

874
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:07,050
on a broken bottle--
Nelson Keece.

875
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,184
-No kidding.

876
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:08,985
-Yeah.

877
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,721
What now, Snoop Doggy Dog?

878
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:14,624
-That guy starts writing
about alcoholics,

879
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,292
and then he becomes one.

880
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:20,030
He starts writing
about transvestites,

881
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,198
he puts on a dress.

882
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,067
Now he's written
about serial killers.

883
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:27,537
-Yeah?

884
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,108
-Look.

885
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,845
I got the girlfriend's,
uh, phone number.

886
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,514
Let's call her up, find
out where she's at,

887
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:38,715
and get our
surveillance team on it.

888
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,921
You know, I need a dictaphone.

889
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,423
-Dictaphone?

890
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,457
-Yeah.

891
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,258
-Oh.

892
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,195
-You got them donuts?

893
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,564
-Yeah.

894
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,332
-I hope you like jelly.

895
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,133
-I hate jelly.

896
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,134
-Yeah, but eat it anyway.

897
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:09,612
-Hey.
-Hi.

898
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,413
How's it going?

899
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,281
-Ah, good.

900
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,415
I'm hungry.

901
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,283
I'd like a hot dog.

902
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:13,817
-OK.

903
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:14,451
Everything?

904
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:15,151
-That'd be great.

905
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,494
All right.

906
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,196
-Here you go.

907
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:26,996
-Thanks.

908
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:27,430
-Oh.

909
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,031
Napkin.

910
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:28,965
Perfect.

911
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:29,766
Thanks.

912
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:30,667
-Bye.

913
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:31,468
-Whoa.

914
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:36,673
-Oh, I-- oh, I'm so sorry.

915
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:38,308
-It was my fault.

916
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,242
-Oh, I'm embarrassed.

917
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,448
-Let me get you another hot dog.

918
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,249
-No.

919
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,951
No.

920
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:49,185
That's not necessary.

921
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,186
-I insist.

922
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:52,822
-Extra ketchup and
mustard, right?

923
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,657
Judging from my jacket,
that's how you like it.

924
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:17,413
Here you go.

925
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,214
-Thanks.

926
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,353
-Thank you.

927
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:24,320
-You've got everything?

928
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,259
-Well, I have to go.

929
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,226
-All right.

930
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,227
Be careful.

931
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,192
-Mr. Keece, are you there?

932
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:36,993
It's me, Mrs. Morris.

933
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:40,930
-Mrs. Morris.

934
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,601
-Oh, hello.

935
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:45,735
-Hi.

936
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:48,204
Have you seen anyone
in my apartment?

937
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,877
-The police.

938
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:55,678
-Oh, great.

939
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,248
-What have you done, Mr. Keece?

940
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,682
-I haven't done anything.

941
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,917
-Well, you must
have done something

942
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,720
because everybody's
looking for you.

943
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,022
-Well, that proves it, then.

944
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,590
-Well, why don't you
just tell them the truth?

945
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:14,664
-I don't think it would make
a difference at this point.

946
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:17,033
-Honesty is the best policy.

947
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:17,834
-I appreciate that.

948
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,941
Juliette?

949
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:25,875
I don't know where to begin.

950
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,480
What I do know is
that I love you

951
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,215
more than anything
on this earth.

952
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:37,320
I know I've let you down.

953
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,122
I know I've hurt you.

954
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:40,556
I know I've been a failure.

955
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:49,832
One thing is had I
gone to the picnic,

956
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,602
this wouldn't have happened.

957
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:54,003
I'm sorry for all this.

958
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,678
I'm going to find him.

959
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:05,048
I have to do one right thing
before this is all over.

960
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:10,453
I'm sending you this tape in
case I never see you again.

961
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,226
I know now I should have written
a story called "The World

962
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:22,899
Through the Eyes of Juliette."

963
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:28,738
It's a beautiful world,
which one dark cloud over it.

964
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,014
OK.

965
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,009
JULIETTE (ON RECORDING): Hi.

966
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,512
Leave a message for
Nelson or Juliette.

967
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,214
-Nelson, it's me.

968
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:45,982
It's me.

969
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,019
Pick up the phone.

970
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:54,590
It's very much in your
interest to talk to me.

971
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,425
-Stefan.

972
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,493
I'm glad you called.

973
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,462
-How are you?

974
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,897
-I'm fine.

975
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:01,697
How do you feel?

976
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,466
-Disappointed.

977
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:04,934
-You weren't supposed
to kill anyone.

978
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,803
You should have
been square with me.

979
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:10,006
I might have surprised you.

980
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,707
-Still.

981
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,410
You did change the plan, Nelson.

982
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,447
I wasn't the one who brought
along that nasty old gun.

983
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:20,249
-I'm just learning how to do
this, and I want to play again.

984
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,722
Cut me some slack, Stefan.

985
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:26,856
Stefan!

986
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:27,657
-I'm here.

987
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:28,925
-Where are you?

988
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:29,859
-Close to your heart.

989
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:37,366
-Why don't you come up
and talk to me about it?

990
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,602
-Oh, come on, Nelson.

991
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,404
The cops are looking
for you, not me.

992
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:42,538
Besides, .

993
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:46,275
Last night marked the
end of our relationship.

994
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:50,947
We now have a beginning
and a middle to your story.

995
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:54,750
All you need is the end.

996
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,420
-We've never finished
the interview.

997
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,990
-That's because you're
a failure, Nelson.

998
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,926
You lack the courage of your
own convictions, unlike me.

999
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,428
I'm a finisher.

1000
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,297
-There's still something missing
from the beginning, Stefan.

1001
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,934
That woman who laughed at you,
the first woman you killed?

1002
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,336
She found you amusing.

1003
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:17,173
Please tell me why
she found you amusing.

1004
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:21,377
-This interview is over.

1005
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,714
-So how does the story end?

1006
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:28,584
-Like it always
does-- with a murder.

1007
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,491
Have you another
victim in mind yet?

1008
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:43,966
-Listen to the tape again--
the one in your machine.

1009
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:48,004
In the end, the voice
is all you'll have left.

1010
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,115
JULIETTE (ON RECORDING): Hi.

1011
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:00,783
Leave a message for
Nelson or Juliette.

1012
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:01,984
-Oh, god.

1013
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:02,785
Juliette.

1014
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,701
Come on.

1015
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:27,743
God.

1016
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:04,006
-You got one, huh?

1017
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:04,807
-That's right.

1018
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,912
You know how hard it is to
find one of those things?

1019
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,057
-Where's the batteries?

1020
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:21,857
-I don't know.

1021
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:28,931
-It says right on the box,
"batteries not included."

1022
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:29,732
-Oh.

1023
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,671
My bad.

1024
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,274
You want me to go
get some batteries?

1025
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:40,743
-Why don't you take
a look around back?

1026
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,346
I'll keep an eye
on the warehouse.

1027
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,313
-All right.

1028
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,114
Cool.

1029
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:49,245
-Now there's a nice lady.

1030
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,117
Oh, shit.

1031
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,552
That's not a lady.

1032
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,353
That was Keece.

1033
01:16:18,274 --> 01:16:19,775
-[whistles] Cab!

1034
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,444
Cab!

1035
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:22,244
Taxi!

1036
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,219
KEECE (ON TAPE): How many
women have you killed?

1037
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:32,421
STEFAN (ON TAPE): How many
women have you made love to?

1038
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,814
-Haynes.

1039
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:32,715
Haynes, talk to me.

1040
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:33,516
You there?

1041
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,361
Hey.

1042
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:46,195
I know you're not asleep.

1043
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:49,865
Ah!

1044
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:58,641
Uh, hey.

1045
01:17:58,641 --> 01:17:59,542
This is Laroue.

1046
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,110
Haynes is dead.

1047
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,213
Uh, I need immediate backup
over at 111 Mission Street.

1048
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:05,180
Repeat-- officer down.

1049
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,116
Send me some backup.

1050
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:07,917
-Hi.

1051
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,988
I'm sorry.

1052
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:14,156
I didn't mean to startle you.

1053
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:21,797
You remember me?

1054
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,771
You dropped these at
the hot dogs stand.

1055
01:18:28,771 --> 01:18:29,572
-Thank you.

1056
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,843
How did you know I was here?

1057
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,545
-Well, that's the bizarre part.

1058
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,080
I live right down
the street and I

1059
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,317
saw you come in
here a while ago.

1060
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:42,117
-Oh.

1061
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,587
That's lucky for me.

1062
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:46,889
-No.

1063
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,858
The luck was all mine.

1064
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:52,294
-Thank you.

1065
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:53,095
-My name is Stefan.

1066
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:00,903
This is great.

1067
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,439
I've never seen anything
like this before.

1068
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:04,540
-You know what?

1069
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,810
Actually, I was just
getting ready to leave.

1070
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,846
Oh, were you?

1071
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:11,647
-Excuse me.

1072
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:22,758
-Excuse me.

1073
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,826
-Costumatic.

1074
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:24,593
-Juliette.

1075
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,397
-Nelson?

1076
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:31,300
-Are you alone?

1077
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,334
-What?

1078
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,135
-Listen to me.

1079
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:34,637
Are you alone?

1080
01:19:34,637 --> 01:19:36,105
Nelson, please.

1081
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,907
Not now.

1082
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:41,143
-The killer is coming for you.

1083
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:41,944
-What?

1084
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:43,379
Who?

1085
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:44,780
-The killer is coming.

1086
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,015
Stefan.
He's coming for you.

1087
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:46,815
Please, honey.

1088
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,385
Believe me this time.

1089
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:51,320
-Oh.

1090
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,056
Oh, I see.

1091
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,925
-Is he there?

1092
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,927
-Uh, mhm.

1093
01:19:58,927 --> 01:19:59,895
-Get out of there.

1094
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:00,696
I'm on my way.

1095
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,271
-OK.

1096
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,707
What do you want?

1097
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:14,076
-Nelso didn't tell you?

1098
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,644
We're writing a book together.

1099
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,350
-Really?

1100
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,719
What's it about?

1101
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:26,622
-The pursuit of happiness.

1102
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:32,695
-Ah!

1103
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:33,295
-Oh.

1104
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,096
Ahh.

1105
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:48,877
Ahh!

1106
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,591
-Juliette.

1107
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,798
Oh, Juliette.

1108
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,299
Romeo's here.

1109
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,772
Come out.

1110
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:27,576
Come on, Juliette.

1111
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:31,847
This is the end of the story.

1112
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:33,282
We can't let Nelson down.

1113
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:54,870
Is that you, Juliette?

1114
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,253
Where are you?

1115
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:25,968
Juliette!

1116
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,346
-Ah!

1117
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,348
-There you are.

1118
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,816
[laugh]

1119
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:49,258
-Ah!

1120
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,963
-Pick up the knife.

1121
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:28,964
Come on.

1122
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:30,132
Pick up the knife!

1123
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:30,933
Come on.

1124
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:37,439
-Ah.

1125
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,456
-I did it for you.

1126
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:57,960
Now you know how it feels.

1127
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,401
-Freeze.

1128
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,202
Freeze.

1129
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,003
-Nelson!

1130
01:25:08,003 --> 01:25:08,904
No!

1131
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:11,406
No!

1132
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:12,908
What have you done?

1133
01:25:12,908 --> 01:25:13,709
-Police.

1134
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:14,643
Lady, get back.
-No.

1135
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:15,844
It's the wrong guy.

1136
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:17,112
-Lady, stay away from him.

1137
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,313
Oh, god.

1138
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,748
-Don't move.

1139
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:20,716
-Oh, god.

1140
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:22,117
Nelson--

1141
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,619
-Do not move.

1142
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,954
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1143
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:26,722
-Juliette.

1144
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,060
Julie, are you OK?

1145
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:42,938
It's OK.

1146
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:43,739
It's OK.

1147
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,512
-Excuse me, Mr. Keece.

1148
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,579
Will you sign one more?

1149
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:25,380
-Sure.

1150
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,957
Here you go.

1151
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,692
-Thank you very much, sir.

1152
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:24,739
MALE SPEAKER: The
killer is coming.

1153
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:25,874
The killer is coming.

1154
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,043
The killer is coming for you.
