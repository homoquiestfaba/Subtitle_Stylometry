(Lucas panting)

220
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:21,157
So, whenever you guys are ready,

221
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,159
we should get out of here.

222
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,999
Uh... back on the raft?

223
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,067
It isn't safe here.

224
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:35,938
There's...

225
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,676
...an animal...

226
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,878
Sweetheart, I'm sure
there's a lot of animals.

227
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,212
It's a monster.

228
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,284
Okay, I saw it.

229
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:52,522
It crawled out of the ocean
and it walks on land,

230
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:55,358
and it drags its food
back out to this...

231
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,861
There's a, there's a black hole
out there.

232
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,200
Okay? Zack washed up.

233
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,969
He was already dead,
and I saw it

234
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,705
drag him out there.

235
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,815
Okay. The family that-that
I was telling you about...

236
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,652
Look at this.

237
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,423
- What is this?
- Do you see that?

238
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:31,094
Th... Those are,
those are his eyes.

239
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:33,262
- It killed them.
- How could you know that?

240
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,732
Because I found their graves.
They were buried here.

241
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,015
Well, then what happened to
the person who dug the graves?

242
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,770
Now... Okay.

243
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,071
Well, there's clearly a current

244
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,439
pulling things
towards the island.

245
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,007
All right?
We all washed up here.

246
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,744
I say we wait, we'll see
if anyone else arrives.

247
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,979
Same. What if Brad shows up?

248
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,649
Brad's dead.

249
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:02,125

I'm sorry, I...

253
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:15,471
What happened to him?

254
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:18,307
Okay, I buried him.

255
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,043
I buried him deep into the
ground and this creature came

256
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:22,245
and dug him up.

257
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:23,780
What does this thing look like?

258
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,081
(stammers)
It's massive.

259
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,316
It-it has two sets of eyes,
and it smells.

260
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,988
Look, I-I got it last night.

261
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,956
Okay? That's black blood.

262
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,127
(sniffles)

263
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,766

Mia, he knew
that he wasn't alone.

265
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,472
He knew that
I was there with him.

MIA:
You still love that sound?

267
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:07,623
I guess everyone does.

268
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,892
Don't think I'll be coming
to the beach much after this.

269
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,164
You know, out on the raft,

270
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,835
for the first time in my life,
I thought I was gonna die.

271
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:24,140
I really thought that...
that that was it.

272
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:28,477
A-And it's funny because
all I was thinking about

273
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,180
is how embarrassing it would be.

274
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:35,017
Everyone back home's
just waiting for me to fail.

275
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:41,557
Out on the raft,

276
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,993
you don't hear waves.

277
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:45,962
You don't hear anything.

278
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:55,371
I'd rather die on the raft
than this place.

279
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:59,442
You don't know
what it's like out there.

280

go that way.

I just want you to feel safe.

to figure this out.

Figure it out?

386
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,609
- Yes, figure it out.
- We need to

387
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,778
get away from this place
as soon as possible.

388
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:53,048
Do you want me to give
you guys a second?

389

Lucas, untie me.

394

Not until you promise me
you'll relax.

395
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:09,465
You all right?

396
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,438
I just want to make sure

You're fine.

398

hanging over your head.

404
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:47,202

on this incredible trip.

Everyone's having a great time,
except you, right?

407
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,578
And the night you come up
to tell me

408
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,514
that you might not be happy,

409
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,516
that you maybe don't want
to be in this...

410

411
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,927
How perfect is that?

412
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,263
No matter where you go,
there's always a storm

413
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,464
right behind you.

414
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:18,100
Lucas, you know I love you,

415
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:21,136
but this is not the time
to talk about this.

416
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,274
Let me go.

417
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:29,812
So, what were you gonna do?

418
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:31,880
- What was your plan, exactly?
- I told you.

419
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:34,783
- Head west.
- No, I get that.

420
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,486
But you head west, you get found

421
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,988
and brought back home.
And then what?

422
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,559
You've got no one else.

423
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:46,595
Where you gonna live?

424
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,965
You gonna go back to school?

425

And afford it how?

426
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:54,837
I pay for your life.

427
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,507
And you pay me back
by taking the raft

428
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,409
and leaving me here
to starve to death?

429
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:02,344
You don't starve here.
