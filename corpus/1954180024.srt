1
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,408
Yes, I'm listening...

2
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,118
fuck.

3
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:17,249
 My name's not "Nehm," it's "Nam."
Namgoung Minsoo, shit.

4
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,461
Family name Namgoung,
first name Minsoo, asshole.

5
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,430
For what?

6
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,439
And if I refuse?

7
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,692
You want a toke, asshole?

8
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,238
It's too good
for a shit like you.

9
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,310
Wake up!

10
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,032
My daughter, Yona.
If I die, she dies too.

11
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,999
One gate,
two lumps of Kronol.

12
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,070
It's my fault?

13
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,624
Of course, I do it
for Kronol.

14
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,299
You've gotta give it to me.

15
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,524
We're approaching.

16
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,481
Don't look.

17
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,558
It's edible?

18
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:18,144
Gotta train a child,
they don't just know that.

19
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,188
I grew up walking over it.

20
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,191
This is
under the snow

21
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,401
on the ground.

22
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,570
What is this?

23
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,446
It's moving.

24
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,407
Underground.

25
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,993
What is it?

26
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,053
Look, you see that?

27
01:11:09,004 --> 01:11:10,024
What?

28
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,858
You seen this woman before?

29
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:25,363
She was a maid
in the lead car.

30
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,408
An Inuit.

31
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,535
An Eskimo, actually.

32
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,580
She knew everything
about ice and snow.

33
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,250
She believed she could survive outside.

34
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:20,611
It's happening.

35
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:54,291
Kronol first!

36
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,931
You blow a fuse or something?

37
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,710
You got a problem with the doors?

38
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,216
Here, smoke a cigarette.

39
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:06,113
You should be grateful.

40
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:10,409
This is the world's last cigarette.

41
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,369
You tail-section hick.

42
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,833
Your story is beautiful, Curtis.

43
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:14,087
But I don't want to open the door.

44
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,592
You know what I want?

45
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:22,762
I want to open a door...

46
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:27,976
But not this one.

47
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,021
That one.

48
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:39,237
One that leads outside.

49
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:43,575
It's been sealed for eighteen years.

50
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,703
Everyone believes
that it's a wall.

51
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:50,290
But it's a fucking door.

52
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:55,378
Open it and let us out of here.

53
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,804
Who knows?

54
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,600
Maybe we can survive.

55
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:13,438
Remember Yekaterina Bridge?

56
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:17,025
When we got massacred.

57
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:21,488
Every year,
I check on it.

58
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,990
You can see the wreckage
of a plane

59
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:26,117
under the snow.

60
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:30,288
After ten years,

61
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:34,793
the tail had just barely been exposed,

62
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:39,673
but now
I can see the fuselage and wings.

63
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:45,470
There's less and less
snow and ice.

64
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,723
It's melting.

65
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:53,645
As snow becomes weaker,

66
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,231
it doesn't take much
for everything to collapse.

67
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:59,901
Recently,

68
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,613
you know what I saw ?

69
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:08,243
Outside, there was...

70
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:16,000
forget it.

71
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:18,169
It's not worth saying.

72
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,969
You don't really think that, do you?

73
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,930
Kronol is, most importantly,

74
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:34,102
a highly flammable chemical.

75
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:35,937
One spark and--boom!

76
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,609
Basically, it's a fucking bomb.

77
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,410
I don't store it
just to get wasted,

78
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:53,621
but to blow this door.

79
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,331
Matches, quickly.

80
01:35:57,793 --> 01:35:58,668
Give 'em!

81
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:02,505
Fire!

82
01:43:12,227 --> 01:43:13,144
Blood!

83
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:17,523
Are you okay?

84
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,527
What's the matter?

85
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:25,573
Get down!

86
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:42,506
Yona.

87
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:45,301
We must open this door.

88
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:49,639
You see these cables?

89
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,265
There are a lot.

90
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,018
Die!

91
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:55,853
Bastard!

92
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:27,551
Yona.

93
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:29,679
The red one, in slot eight.

94
01:44:29,888 --> 01:44:31,222
No, seven!

95
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,288
Yona, the Kronol!

96
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:11,502
Yona, stop!

97
01:49:11,836 --> 01:49:12,711
No.

98
01:49:23,515 --> 01:49:25,516
Put the Kronol on the door.

99
01:50:06,683 --> 01:50:07,516
It's done!

100
01:50:07,726 --> 01:50:09,685
Curtis, the matches.

101
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:10,681
There's one left.
