1
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,080
I met a guy once.

2
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,449
Who told me about a place

3
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,484
that contained the seven gates

4
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,821
that lead to Hell.

5
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,691
I thought that it was the
most beautiful thing

6
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,094
I had ever heard.

7
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,341
What's up, man?  You alright?

8
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,612
Cold as shit outside.

9
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,284
You out here camping'?

10
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,690
Look like shit.

11
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,711
Look man, if you
ain't gonna talk,

12
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,680
I'll just let
you out here.

13
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,417
I'm trying to be nice.

14
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,926
You got any friends
around here or anything?

15
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,628
[Laughter]

16
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,297
<i>Get off of me!</i>

17
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,832
He is fucking foul.

18
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,968
- Get up.
- Who the fuck just said that?!

19
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,669
Me.

20
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,037
[laughter]

21
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,606
I'm gettin' out.

22
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,675
- Let me lay down for a sec
- Fuck you.

23
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,644
[laughter]

24
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,317
Hold on! Take my cigarette!

25
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,958
That was James' head.

26
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,796
[cross talk]

27
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:46,812
James, wake up.

28
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,547
I got him.

29
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,582
- I've got to go pee
- The bathroom is that way!

30
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,984
Killing me!

31
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,386
Oh my god!

32
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,656
Asshole!

33
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,491
Beat him up when
he's upstairs!

34
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,992
Oh my god, Nicole
is beating James!

35
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,461
James, I should
help you!

36
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,471
Let me stand up! This
bathroom is repulsive!

37
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,638
No, it's OK. The bathroom
downstairs is repulsive.

38
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,940
This one is too.

39
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,942
No!

40
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,148
Alright.

41
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,584
You're good.

42
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,852
Oh God!

43
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,154
Oh god!

44
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,658
Owe my nose!

45
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,461
Please pull your pants up.

46
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,700
Alright, alright,
alright. C'mon.

47
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,012
Ride 'em like a surf board!

48
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,624
<i>James.</i>

49
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,462
I have heard something
about you obviously,

50
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,663
over the years.

51
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,999
Yep

52
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,169
I know you're not thrilled
about being here,

53
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:23,175
but I'm sure there's a reason
why you're coming to see me.

54
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:27,946
Uh, my father will continue
to pay my rent as long as I

55
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:33,051
come and talk to you for
however long we have to do this

56
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,920
and that's what
I'm going to do.

57
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,657
I want to try to
figure out exactly

58
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:46,164
what your conception of
a normal relationship is

59
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,032
Um...

60
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,737
Be gentle. Be gentle - Oh!

61
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,875
Oh my god.
Oh your burnt him!

62
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,710
[laughter]

63
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,086
- Shit.
- Oh my god.

64
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,138
See that's one of the problems
that Bob has brought up to me.

65
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,110
He feels that in some
cases your friends,

66
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,780
or the relationships that you
key in to your friends,

67
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:41,620
um, I guess to put it in
a different way,

68
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,921
are not reaching the heights
he'd like you to reach.

69
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,824
I know how he feels
about my friends.

70
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,260
Is it music that aligns you
with these people?

71
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,963
Is that a common bond?

72
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:57,168
I'm wondering if music is a key;
an alliance here that builds up?

73
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,137
It's a symptom, rather
than, y'know, the cause.

74
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,040
It's a downward slope too.

75
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,942
It's a gradual progression.

76
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,946
You start out going to shows
and meeting these people.

77
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,148
And then it grows from there.

78
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,918
Their circle of friends becomes
your circle of friends.

79
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,954
And deeper and deeper down
the wild world we go.

80
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,077
You fucking dick!

81
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,964
What's up? What are y'all doing?

82
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,768
This fucking guy -ridiculous.

83
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,071
You take the scissors out.
I'll tell you when.

84
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,906
That looks alright.

85
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,378
Dirty ass.

86
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,017
Just grab the tweezers.

87
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,219
That's gross. I'm not
doing that to you.

88
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,022
Sure you don't want any?

89
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,256
No thanks.

90
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,892
Alright.

91
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,459
Hold up. Gay chicken.

92
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,894
We're playing gay chicken!

93
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,830
Gay chicken! Gay chicken!

94
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,164
James! Gay chicken!

95
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,432
Watch out! Watch out!

96
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,174
I fuckin' win!

97
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,210
I win, you fuckin'...

98
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,978
You won't do it.

99
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,380
Gay chicken! You have to!

100
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,184
Gay chicken that bitch!

101
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,221

102
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,057
You guys won't do it!

103
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,094
I can't do it, dude.

104
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,269
[speaking softly]

105
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,423
- You alright?
- Yeah.

106
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,926
- You sure?
- Yeah.

107
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:45,423
♪

108
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,987
What's up?

109
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,957
You guys get them shrooms?

110
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,961
Want some?

111
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,897
Why not?

112
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,600
C'mon. Grow some balls.

113
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,973
Hey, I'm not playing babysitter
while ya'll are trippin'.

114
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,246
So are they all

115
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,247
Yeah

116
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,350
I guess it's really nice out.
It's a good day for it, right?

117
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,086
Yeah, they're gonna
have a blast.

118
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,421
- You want to do 'em?
- I want to do 'em.

119
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,492
You are fuckin'...

120
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,561
Not havin' that... [inaudible]

121
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,596
Watch this.

122
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,298
What are you doing?

123
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,034
Table toppin'.

124
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,005
I forgot how to do it.

125
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:15,380
Ow! Ow!

126
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,219
This is called a cradle.

127
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,121
Ow!

128
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,127
I know that one hurt.

129
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,533
I'll help you up
whenever you're ready.

130
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,169
Na, I don't need your help.

131
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,640
Fuck! Ow!

132
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,108
Dammit.

133
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,210
Hey, can you do this?

134
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,013
Who's the boyfriend now?

135
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,749
You gotta stir it.

136
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,185
There you go.

137
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,255
Our jumbalaya's not
gonna turn our so good.

138
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,728
See, like I'm dropping shit
left and right.

139
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,697
The worst experience I
ever had was um...

140
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,368
that night that we
all ate acid...

141
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,269
The acid was great when
we went to that show

142
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,738
at Barclay
House like...

143
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,306
It went off
without a hitch.

144
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:52,710
Then we got back
and me and Scott,

145
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,445
like everybody were
up in his room,

146
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,749
and rippin' those
three foot bongs.

147
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,718
Like everything I saw
around me was manufactured

148
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,489
by like some greater,
like evil malicious like thing

149
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,092
Like I thought that I was
like stuck in this like...

150
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,528
Like some how in a past life I
had done some wrong or

151
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,665
something so my entire life
up until that point was like...

152
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,501
Always like my parents were
at war with my friends...

153
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,369
- See that's the thing. I
don't have the experiences

154
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,640
I've never done like,
drugs like that.

155
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,343
I mean, I'd like to.

156
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,813
You become accustom
to the fucking

157
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,416
culture itself and you surround
yourself with drug people

158
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:35,186
then by the time you
realize like where you are,

159
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,722
waking up in places
you've never been before,

160
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,793
like it's beyond the point
of no return. You know,

161
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,662
it's like you cannot... Where
do you go? It's all you know.

162
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,632
It's like, it's
like fucking...

163
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,435
It's like a walk down Toad
Road for Christ's sake.

164
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,104
Like, you're there. You're
fucked already.

165
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,440
What's Toad Road?

166
00:17:55,442 --> 00:18:00,578
Oh yeah! You're a city girl.
You don't know about Toad Road.

167
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,549
Alright  Well um..

168
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:09,087
Toad Road is uh, like the local
high school local legend.

169
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,489
It's only in York.

170
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:16,527
Like, it's this, uh this
road that used to be behind

171
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:20,131
this mental ward or mental
institution or something,

172
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:25,369
and uh, you walk down this road

173
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,872
and like you go through
this first gate.

174
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,309
like right at the
front of this like

175
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,845
big woods, wilderness. It's
just a little, tiny trail.

176
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,746
And then as you go, you
see like your second gate

177
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,548
and your third gate, and
you keep going through

178
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,450
and like things keep getting
more and more fucked up.

179
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,487
Like you start, like...
It's like a bad trip.

180
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,422
Which I know doesn't
mean anything to you,

181
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,824
because, but
maybe it will,

182
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,293
if you had
it your way.

183
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,761
You go through you first
gate then your second gate

184
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,730
and like you start hearing
things and seeing things

185
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,499
and like people
are following you.

186
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,434
Things that just aren't there
and time changes and...

187
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,735
- Well have you ever been there?

188
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,237
Na, of course not.

189
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:03,541
Because it's a fucking... It's
like the, the man in the mirror.

190
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,676
The fucking
Bloody Mary shit.

191
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,280
It'd still be fun to go.
Like will you go with me?

192
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:14,318
No! It's the opposite of fun.

193
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,621
It's getting drunk and going
down a trail at night,

194
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,423
with a bunch of people who don't
know where they're going...

195
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,560
What if you're
tripping?

196
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,828
Then it would be
even fucking worse.

197
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,396
You would never
even make it home.

198
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,732
You'd get lost in the
middle of the woods.

199
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:32,403
If you really want to, this
weekend, me and like you know,

200
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,606
the gang are going to that
cave up off of like,

201
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:40,912
in uh, where ever, it's that
little like, landmark cave

202
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:44,448
and we're going to do
mushrooms in there.

203
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,585
And that'll be scary and spooky.

204
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,954
It'd be better than
Toad Road, though.

205
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,425
And I can eat some mushrooms?

206
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,560
Yeah. I'm not gonna
give you permission.

207
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,662
I don't need
your permission,

208
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,529
but if I'm going to
be with you...

209
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,832
- Whoah! Wow!

210
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,869
Look at you.

211
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:09,473
Clearly. Oh well, that's
fine. That's fine.

212
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,875
Do what you gotta
do. I'll be there.

213
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,376
So when is this?
This weekend?

214
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,312
- This weekend.
- Alright.

215
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,620
Oh my god. It feels amazing.

216
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,290
Are you ready?

217
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,292
It smells great.

218
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,931
This is fucking amazing.

219
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,500
This is gonna be nice
on mushrooms.

220
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,982
So uh, we have to go through...
You see right there?

221
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,684
- Down there?
- Yeah.

222
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,486
So I guess I'll put my
backpack up here for a second.

223
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,388
Help you up
if you want.

224
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,857
And we'll go
straight down there.

225
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,564
Owe, that
wasn't good.

226
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,351
I'll let you guys hit
the piles afterwards

227
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:11,862
so you can help out now
even out a little bit more.

228
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,366
We doing this all together?

229
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,803
That's a big fucking...
It is a big one.

230
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,071
Big bastard.

231
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,872
I'm takin' the big
kahuna right here.

232
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,341
Look at these two.

233
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,482
This big one is
gonna hurt.

234
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,788
They're so big
and nasty.

235
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,789
You still haven't
eaten all of yours?

236
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,757
No.

237
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,359
Better get 'em down.

238
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,960
Takin' my time.
Fuck you guys.

239
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,666
The only thing I got
to say about it is:

240
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:49,800
Fucking retarded, dude.

241
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,136
I expected come out
here and you know,

242
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:55,639
and chill in the fuckin'
cave with y'all

243
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,575
and you gotta always take
shit to the extreme.

244
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:02,847
if I thought I was
better than you.

245
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,416
Always act like you're smarter
and the more mature one

246
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,518
because you don't
get fucked up.

247
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,453
Um 'cause I don't
wanna get retarded

248
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,789
and wanna trip in
caves. I'm sorry.

249
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,125
We're just havin'
a good time.

250
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,993
If that's your idea
of a good time

251
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,028
then fuckin' more
power to you,

252
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,598
but I'm not gonna be helpin' you
out when you're trippin' around,

253
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,032
fuckin' fallin' on
rocks and shit.

254
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,402
I'm not doing that
again so you can...

255
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,137
- Don't do it then.
- I'm not.

256
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,638
You didn't
have to come.

257
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,174
Dude, I'll be out then.
That's all you gotta say.

258
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,811
Fuck. Gimme my fuckin'
flash light then.

259
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,646
- See ya.
- Fuck you.

260
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,049
I'm fucking not doing
this shit again.

261
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,919
Are you just gonna go back
and sit in the car?

262
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,423
Pussy.

263
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:51,929
Fuck both of you.

264
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,633
Can't even make a
smooth fuckin' exit.

265
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,067
Shut the fuck up.

266
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,038
I got your keys too, dick.

267
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,139
Donnie!

268
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,678
You're such an asshole.

269
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,215
No. You can't just
let him leave.

270
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:14,452
I'm sick of his shit.

271
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,521
Why don't you just stay with us?

272
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:22,493
- No, I'm...
- He's a big boy.

273
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,496
Maybe eventually he'll get the
hint that no one is after him.

274
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:28,132
Well, I'm after him 'cause I'm
not gonna let him sit there.

275
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:28,833
Sit down.

276
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,134
C'mon.

277
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,803
Hey! Sit!

278
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,946
[breathing heavy]

279
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,082
James?

280
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,951
James?!

281
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,014
Oh my god.

282
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,265
Sara. Sara!

283
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,302
You alright?

284
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,243
We're going right now, alright?
We're gonna get you out of here.

285
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,888
When you're
introduced to LSD

286
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,324
and unless you've
taken some other drug,

287
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,794
for instance,
like marijuana,

288
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,264
you know it's an all
together new thing.

289
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,836
You actually can have a
religious experience.

290
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,207
And it can be even
more important

291
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:29,113
than reading the bible
lie 6 six times,

292
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,181
or becoming a pope, or
something like that.

293
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,387
The one thing that
happens when you

294
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:40,157
explore psychedelics
is that um,

295
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,693
you have a sense that there
are a lot of other options

296
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,194
and other possibilities,

297
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,330
other forms of consciousness,
dimensions of reality,

298
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,833
and like what we're
living in is not....

299
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,070
I think the function of
awareness can go into the past,

300
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:56,040
the future, or the
hidden present equally.

301
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:59,043
Why? Because when you go
into an altered state,

302
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,679
you go beyond the framework
of space and time.

303
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:08,352
Those locations to which
one makes a pilgrimage,

304
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:13,390
they are spaces containing
the meeting of worlds

305
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,827
and standing on those
intersections one may be

306
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,029
in both worlds at
the same time.

307
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,403
Hello.

308
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,239
<i>Hey, are you at school?</i>

309
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,108
No I'm still at home actually.

310
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:36,180
<i>Oh. Why?</i>

311
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:40,484
<i>Well, do you wanna roll?</i>
<i>We have some E pills.</i>

312
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,186
Who are you with?

313
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,488
<i>Scott, James,</i>
<i>Jamie, you know....</i>

314
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,823
Everyone?

315
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:46,990
<i>Yeah.</i>

316
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,358
You have E pills?

317
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,427
<i>Yeah.</i>

318
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,466
That might help my
mood a little bit.

319
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:59,369
<i>Yeah, definitely. I'll make</i>
<i>sure you have a good time.</i>

320
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,106
Alright, yeah. Then
maybe I'll come over.

321
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,474
I'll leave soon.

322
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:04,875
<i>Alright. Awesome.</i>

323
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,778
Alright. Bye.

324
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,363
If you can stand it, putting it
up your butt is pretty intense.

325
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,999
You curl up in the fetal
position for like a half hour

326
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,801
and just wanna kill yourself.

327
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,337
And then you take a
shit and it hurts.

328
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,206
But then you're fucked up.

329
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:42,379
So, it's a Vicks thing but
instead of sniffing it, you

330
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,481
turn it around and
there are little holes

331
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,049
so you put your
mouth over the holes

332
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,484
and you blow the
medicine into his eyes

333
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,419
and rub his head at
the same time

334
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:55,058
and it pretty much
feels like heaven.

335
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,393
Less talk, more Vicks.

336
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:59,363
Good.

337
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,913
Jesus Christ.

338
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,490
I'm fucked up.

339
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,862
Wow!

340
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:32,930
[laughter]

341
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,285
I can't see I can't see!

342
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,958
Oh my god!

343
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,392
You ever had sex on
a roof period?

344
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:05,329
You ever have - ooh
boy, you don't know

345
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,231
what you're
missing, man...

346
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,166
I fucked that girl Leah
on Brent's roof one time

347
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,602
and shit was just like....

348
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:15,539
Hey! There's downtown
Baltimore City!

349
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,876
It was the most amazing
fuckin' thing I ever did!

350
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,444
The view is better
than the pussy.

351
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,051
I fuckin'....

352
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,996
You know I had a week
or two where I just

353
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,131
keep coming up with shit
that I really like.

354
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,301
And then I'll have like 3 months
when there's like nothing there

355
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:55,612
because it's like I'm not
doing anything right...

356
00:31:55,614 --> 00:32:05,022
because it's like I'm not
doing anything right...

357
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,657
This is like too
fucking intense.

358
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,326
I need to go like fucking rub my
face with ice or something.

359
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,361
I'm fucking sweating
and sobbing.

360
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,564
Are we still going
to the roof?

361
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,566
No, but yeah.

362
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,238
Oh, since everyone's on
sexstasy, I brought condoms.

363
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,375
Jamie can do his condom trick.

364
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:32,349
Spermicide burns really bad.

365
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,350
So it's gonna hurt.

366
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,740
Dude, that looks like
.... cream.

367
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,135
That tasted really bad.

368
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,053
Aren't you cold?

369
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,757
No. Are you cold?

370
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,659
So? It's nice out.

371
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,229
Nice?! Are you serious?

372
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,064
What are you reading?
What are you reading?

373
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,600
- Books.
- Books.

374
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,135
It's just something for school.

375
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,303
I've been sitting out
here all day.

376
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:03,273
Reading that.

377
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,474
How depressing.
School work and rain.

378
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,410
It's not depressing at all.

379
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,177
- You are cold.
- I'm not cold.

380
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,413
Yes you are.

381
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:11,314
Come here. Let me hug you.

382
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,582
I'll warm you up.

383
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,724
So like, I wanted to
like talk to you.

384
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,325
I guess tonight would be a
good nice since I'm here.

385
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,531
OK?

386
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,700
OK well, you're
still fucking James.

387
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,770
So what am I suppose to do? Just
stop hanging out with James?

388
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:38,508
Do you have a territory problem?

389
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,143
This is the first time in my
life that I've been able to do

390
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:44,381
whatever is I want to do and
not feel guilty about it.

391
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,551
And not feel like
someone is judging me.

392
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:50,687
Like the further this goes,
the more I get feelings and...

393
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:55,459
So what, are we just supposed
to stop hanging out then?

394
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,462
I don't wanna stop hanging out.

395
00:34:58,464 --> 00:34:59,830
I don't want to cause problems
between you and one of your

396
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:02,165
Fuck James!

397
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,270
Hey, I'm sorry. Don't
give me that look.

398
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,323
Can we do that stuff now?

399
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,563
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

400
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,332
It will take like
two minutes.

401
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,213
I really, like I really wish
that I thought that

402
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:54,751
you could understand.

403
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,554
I don't really know what
to say. I mean...

404
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:01,391
You know everything that I've
been thinking about going

405
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:02,926
through I can
never turn off.

406
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,414
It's, it's good. It's a good
thing. It's not a bad thing.

407
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:33,857
There is nothing
scary about this.

408
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,260
I am piecing
everything together.

409
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:40,230
Everything.

410
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,365
This is something that
is happening to me.

411
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,567
Holy shit!

412
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,873
Whoah!

413
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,683
This doesn't make any sense.

414
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,618
- It's like you're tripping...
- But you're drunk.

415
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,788
Yeah. Exactly! It's awesome!

416
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,855
Whitleigh is not a back up plan.
Whitleigh is another influence.

417
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,691
I'm not saying that she is.

418
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,861
You're fucked up and if you
wanna throw that in my face

419
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,732
that's fine, but these
are the obstacles that I

420
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,267
overcome because
i care about us.

421
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,735
James, this past...

422
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:56,973
Are you going to let
me speak or not?

423
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,541
I'm doing this. I'm doing this
because I feel like I need to.

424
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,944
Can't you just smoke a
bowl and do the dishes

425
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,445
like a normal fucking person?

426
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,814
Why do you have
to just...

427
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:09,019
There is no bigger
picture to drugs...

428
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,888
OK so that's the entire problem:
Is that, that's what you think.

429
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,590
I know what I know.

430
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,625
This isn't about
the bigger picture

431
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,696
because I'm like
getting fucked up.

432
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:23,867
You've chased it!
I've found it!

433
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:29,406
I am this close!

434
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:33,543
You can come with me or
you can stay behind.

435
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,657
Who have Adderall?

436
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,093
Um, nobody anymore.

437
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,097
There is no more at all?

438
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,034
Well, there's a little bit,

439
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,803
but I'm saving it
for a little while.

440
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:38,375
I just want like a bump. I'm
going to fucking pass out.

441
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,043
Well, we just did a shit load.

442
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,378
I know. I saw you.

443
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,780
to share it with 3
people like I just did.

444
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:44,948
No. No. No.

445
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,851
We can split it.
We can split it.

446
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:53,056
I just hurt my
fucking arm so bad.

447
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,092
I really did. I just cut it on a
thermometer or something.

448
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,995
You cut your arm
on a thermometer?

449
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,397
You see it?

450
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,101
Sit down. Sit down.

451
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,569
Yeah this is the only people
that need to be here.

452
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:13,476
Can you snort it?! Give me!

453
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:01,758
James: Some times there's
distance, or some times there's

454
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,561
your lover or girlfriend
or whatever the fuck...

455
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:07,597
<i>Does things you</i>
<i>don't agree with.</i>

456
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,836
But you still try to at least be
there to watch over them,

457
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,772
or make sure they don't
do something stupid,

458
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,807
<i>or get too far in to it.</i>

459
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:23,513
All of a sudden, your role
has, in this relationship

460
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:29,552
has become similar
to mine to you.

461
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:33,957
Listen to yourself. Make sure
what you are saying is true.

462
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,125
Make sure that what you're
saying is you in that you're not

463
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:41,531
steering yourself and her to
some place you don't want to go.

464
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,168
<i>YouTube Voiceover: Alright</i>
<i>everyone, here's your answer</i>

465
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,204
<i>to the seven gates of</i>
<i>Hell. Right here.</i>

466
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,851
<i>There's the first gate.</i>

467
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,139
You're gonna wake up
dead one of these days.

468
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:26,643
So then what are
you gonna do?

469
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:29,879
I'm going to try to stop
being such an asshole.

470
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,316
Long term, I need a
goal, you know...

471
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,818
I need something to
keep me in line.

472
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,788
I was thinking,
it seems like

473
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,190
What if I went
to school?

474
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:46,329
I'm failing
school right now.

475
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,298
But I mean if
you wanna go...

476
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,568
I mean, it gives you a sense of
direction or a purpose you know.

477
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,071
You might find yourself,
like, you know.

478
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,674
family and you
ran in to us.

479
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,176
And granted, that
might not have been

480
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,645
the best thing in
the world for you,

481
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:07,917
but maybe, maybe it's time to
cut the cord and run again,

482
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,185
you know.... So you
would go to York then?

483
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:13,156
It's an option. I mean...

484
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:17,293
I'm gonna go be
wherever you are,

485
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:22,599
but what if we both
just kind of ran away

486
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,733
and fucking' left Jamie and all
those idiots in our the dust?

487
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,802
And actually did
something with our lives

488
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,237
while they go piss and
puke on themselves.

489
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,008
It's an option
though, you know?

490
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,813
Yeah.

491
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,182
I mean, if you're
serious about it...

492
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:43,152
Yeah, I kind of am.

493
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,755
Then let's do it while you're
actually feeling motivated.

494
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,858
That's my point. I don't know
how long this is going to last.

495
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,660
I kind of have an opportunity.
I got to seize the moment.

496
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,397
I can probably finally start
putting my life together

497
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,266
and living like
a normal human being.

498
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:02,772
We could both be and be
a lot better for it if we just

499
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,908
came up with a plan you know,
and did right by each other.

500
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,280
It's not too late to turn back
if you're getting cold feet.

501
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,882
It's cool.

502
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,283
Alright.

503
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:03,733
Well, I was hoping we
could go the whole way.

504
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:05,702
Are you OK with that?

505
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:09,005
Well, what whole way? I
mean it's the woods Sara,

506
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,040
it doesn't really
end anywhere.

507
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,242
I know, but no one has ever
made it past the fifth gate.

508
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,445
So, I'm trying to go.

509
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,346
Because there
are no gates.

510
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:18,948
People just get
lost in the woods.

511
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,317
I know, but you can't see
the gates till it gets dark.

512
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,720
You can't see
anything in dark.

513
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,221
We didn't bring any flash
lights or anything.

514
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,791
I know, but the real gates are
gone so now when it gets dark...

515
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:31,928
We don't need flash lights. What
do we need flash lights for?

516
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,731
All the fucking gates are torn
down and you can't see them,

517
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,365
so when it gets dark
is when shit

518
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:40,169
apparently really
starts happening.

519
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,971
OK. Like what?

520
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,344
Well, from what
I've read,

521
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,046
at the first gate, you
start feeling like things

522
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:51,781
are watching you.

523
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,351
At the second gate you
start hearing things.

524
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,890
At the third gate you
actually start seeing things.

525
00:46:00,892 --> 00:46:05,094
At the fourth gate,
apparently people pass out.

526
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:12,068
Good. That's great.

527
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,338
Apparently, time starts
to warp and change

528
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,877
and you lose grip on anything
that's happening around you.

529
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:23,045
And no one knows what the
sixth and seventh gates are

530
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:28,050
'cause no one has
gotten past the fifth.

531
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:31,020
But that's what I
want to find out.

532
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:35,825
We're gonna find 'em?
Is that the idea?

533
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,828
Well, I just kind of
wanted to drop some

534
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:44,167
acid and see
what happened.

535
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:45,468
I know you think
it's stupid.

536
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,070
No. I just think... I
don't think it's stupid,

537
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:50,139
I just think that what's
going to happen is

538
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,341
you're going to drop
acid and then yeah,

539
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,443
you probably won't have any
trouble finding the gates

540
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:59,415
that make you see and hear
things that aren't there.

541
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:04,387
James, after the cave, I haven't
even really been talking to

542
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,088
anyone about what's
been going on;

543
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,957
not even Whitleigh
because...

544
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,358
Well, good.

545
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,497
I feel like something
attached itself to me.

546
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,098
It's like pulling me
along some where

547
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,601
but I don't know where
the fuck it's going.

548
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,939
This is just something I
feel like I have to do.

549
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:25,107
And it's been pushing me.

550
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,243
And I've been letting it.

551
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:31,881
I don't just take acid like
all your fucking friends do

552
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:35,518
and hang out and
stare at walls.

553
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,186
You know it's
not like that for me.

554
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:45,361
This isn't just an
urban legend.

555
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,431
Everyone thinks the
seventh gate is Hell.

556
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,334
I don't think it is.

557
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:53,636
I think it might be
something better.

558
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:55,304
Something real.

559
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,306
I think it probably sucks.

560
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:01,077
I'm not having a
good time any more.

561
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,447
and if we have to wait
for it to get dark....

562
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,382
It'll be dark soon. Don't worry.

563
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,189
I'll be right back. I'm
going to get the...

564
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,491
Need help?

565
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,260
No.

566
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:32,441
[Ominous drum beats]

567
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,300
[Omnious music continues]

568
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,523
<i>There are seven gates</i>
<i>that lead to Hell.</i>

569
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,726
<i>When you pass through</i>
<i>the first gate,</i>

570
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:34,597
<i>a feeling washes over you that</i>
<i>you're completely unwanted.</i>

571
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:39,635
Those thing that are pulling at
you will rip you to shreds,

572
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:45,574
<i>but you can see them. You can</i>
<i>only feel them tugging away.</i>

573
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,444
<i>It's hopeless.</i>

574
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,549
<i>When you pass through</i>
<i>the second gate of Hell,</i>

575
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,385
<i>you start to hear things.</i>

576
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,688
<i>The wind isn't the wind. The</i>
<i>leaves aren't the leaves.</i>

577
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:05,494
<i>And the ground starts to</i>
<i>spit out little voices.</i>

578
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:09,498
<i>The voices are your mother or</i>
<i>your father telling you how</i>

579
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,634
<i>you've disappointed them.</i>

580
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:16,705
As much as it should hurt to
feel that, you already knew it.

581
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,608
<i>So there's no</i>
<i>reason to run.</i>

582
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,145
<i>When you pass though</i>
<i>the third gate of Hell,</i>

583
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:27,416
<i>You start to see things.</i>

584
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:31,320
<i>the voices start</i>
<i>to become faces.</i>

585
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:34,457
<i>Start to become shadows.</i>

586
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:36,425
<i>They move around you.</i>

587
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,328
<i>You close your eyes</i>
<i>and they're still there.</i>

588
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,831
<i>And in the moment of</i>
<i>all this confusion,</i>

589
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:47,336
<i>for just a second, you</i>
<i>might see some one you know.</i>

590
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:52,408
<i>Nodding, telling</i>
<i>you to turn back.</i>

591
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:56,645
<i>As you pass through</i>
<i>the fourth gate of Hell,</i>

592
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:00,816
<i>everything around</i>
<i>you begins to die.</i>

593
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:06,255
<i>As you move forward,</i>
<i>the leaves start to fall,</i>

594
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:13,729
<i>the clouds blacken,</i>
<i>the trees cave in.</i>

595
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:19,401
<i>It gets cold; so cold.</i>

596
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:26,842
<i>But even as everything around</i>
<i>you freezes and becomes still,</i>

597
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:35,784
<i>you feel warm, powerful,</i>
<i>ready to keep marching through.</i>

598
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,802
Sara!

599
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,542
Sara!

600
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,413
Sara!

601
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,922
<i>When you pass through</i>
<i>the fifth gate,</i>

602
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:24,893
<i>time beings to change.</i>

603
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:28,764
<i>With every step forward...</i>

604
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:33,469
<i>memory falls to the wayside.</i>

605
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:38,407
<i>There is no past, no</i>
<i>present, no future.</i>

606
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:45,314
<i>And if you're not focussed, if</i>
<i>you don't know exactly where</i>

607
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:48,817
<i>you want to be, you</i>
<i>can get lost in there.</i>

608
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:53,355
<i>And that for anyone who fails</i>
<i>to keep moving forward,</i>

609
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:56,792
is a completely
different level of Hell.

610
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,402
[Thunder]

611
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:21,884
Scott!

612
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,022
Fuck.

613
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,460
Alright dude, well
nwe got to talk.

614
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,862
People are
looking for you.

615
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,364
Cops have been
looking for you like...

616
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,665
What?

617
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,433
Is she OK? Where
the hell is she?

618
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:13,936
She fuckin'
took the bikes.

619
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:17,072
I have to go to
fucking Whitleigh's

620
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:20,042
which is fucking
humiliating.

621
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,644
Try and find her? Everybody's
been trying to find her.

622
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,747
She fucked up my keys so I can't
get into our fucking apartment.

623
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,548
We don't have an
apartment any more!

624
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,785
Fuck you! We don't have
an apartment any more.

625
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,421
There's no apartment
now thanks to you.

626
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,790
You got thrown out of the
apartment in a day?!

627
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:39,128
In a day? It's been way fucking
longer than a day, James.

628
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,030
You seriously have been
gone all that time

629
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,466
and you don't know what
the fuck is going on?

630
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,468
What the fuck, Jamie!

631
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,170
You need to find
some where to go.

632
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:50,072
Your dad thinks you just ran
off and you're a junkie now.

633
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:51,673
Like you probably
can't stay with him.

634
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:53,175
Is she OK?

635
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:54,877
I don't know, Jamie!
I don't know.

636
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:59,982
I'm like starting to freak
out a little bit, alright.

637
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,517
You can't
stay with me.

638
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,685
Fine. I'm not asking.

639
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,053
I don't give a shit, Jamie.

640
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,055
Then where are you going to go?

641
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,626
I... Goddammit. Whatever.

642
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:13,662
Fine. Take me....

643
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,699
Take you?

644
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,469
Just take me wherever the
fuck you're staying at now.

645
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:28,210
Where do I live, man?
Like where's my shit?

646
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,145
Where do I sleep?

647
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:34,616
Dude, like, people
were looking for you.

648
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,785
You need a cigarette?

649
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,154
I... Yeah man.

650
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,560
I know you haven't
already, but like you

651
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:47,596
can not tell anybody
about me being here.

652
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,531
The cops are fucking
looking for me like I gotta,

653
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:54,002
I need to like fucking go!
Like I need to hide!

654
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,048
Not long after you left, like
everything fell apart.

655
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,783
Everybody moved home.

656
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:09,685
Whitleigh got her own place.

657
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:11,487
Scott moved home.

658
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,255
No one knows where
the fuck Sara's at.

659
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:15,858
No one knows where
you've been at.

660
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,062
Like everyone who's been
here has moved home.

661
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,630
Like everybody's moved on, dude.

662
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:24,800
Shit's fallen apart
since you left.

663
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,037
You have no idea.

664
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,909
I've got an uncle who can maybe
let me crash for a little while.

665
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,550
I warned you. I told you the
place was a dump.

666
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:44,953
- It's fine, man.
- Alright.

667
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,766
I ain't gonna lock you in, but
lock it up when you leave.

668
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,701
- Yeah.
- Alright.

669
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,179
Yeah, as I said, it's
pretty empty up here.

670
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:15,250
It's not empty, but it's close.

671
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:19,855
Yeah.

672
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:23,125
Just don't do anything stupid
like burn it down.

673
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:25,060
Try not to break any
more of these

674
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,563
windows that aren't
already broken.

675
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:33,335
You got fuckin' bugs
and stuff in here?

676
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,937
Plenty of bees.

677
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,243
Just keep killin' 'em.
Eventually, they'll stop.

678
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,312
We'll cover 'em up
some way later.

679
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:45,013
After like twelve or
one o'clock... Hey.

680
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:50,352
There's an outhouse
over there you can use.

681
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:52,087
Or if you just gotta
piss, just go around

682
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,322
the side of the
building of something.

683
00:59:53,324 --> 00:59:54,723
Alright?

684
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,358
- OK.
- Alright.

685
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,263
Come on, buddy.

686
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:11,326
You and I we go on one
week, two week,

687
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:14,830
drink and not remember
a goddamn thing,

688
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:17,999
but months man,
months have passed.

689
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:21,269
I don't know where the
fuck your head's at.

690
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,211
Somebody like you or I
go missing, James

691
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:30,746
nobody turns there
fucking head.

692
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,380
Somebody like Sara;

693
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,349
that's a good, good,
young girl right there.

694
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:37,252
You know, she doesn't live
the life you and I live.

695
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,954
She's got people
looking for her.

696
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:42,023
Her parents, probably
her fucking church.

697
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:46,294
Jesus Christ, man, how do you
expect to not, not expect people

698
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:51,767
to raise their eye brows at
you? And go "Huh?"

699
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,102
Even as far as I'm concerned,
man, you're fuckin' up

700
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,538
because you're running.

701
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:02,177
- Shut up. Shut up
- Na man, it's the truth.

702
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,813
The world's a big place,
man. You can run

703
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,248
as far as the
eye can see,

704
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,050
but your problems
don't go away.

705
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:13,455
You gotta give me
something here, James.

706
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:19,828
Thanks for the beer.

707
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,799
Thanks for nothing.

708
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,903
Don't fuckin' look at me.

709
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,404
Seriously, they could jump
the shit out of this fence.

710
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,439
They could just fuck
you the hell up.

711
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,575
All you can do is
pretend that you're dead.

712
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,844
Really nothing. You can't
do shit about it.

713
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,479
Even that little one.

714
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,849
Those two are little. They
would still fuck you up.

715
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:42,818
That little ass horse. He still
will beat the shit out of you.

716
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,867
I missed.

717
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:05,440
One handed? Get the
fuck out of here.

718
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,047
Don't hit anything on your first
shot. Make me feel stupid.

719
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,920
Oh! Good shot.

720
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,458
Is that the one you
were aiming at?

721
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,593
Did I hit one?

722
01:04:24,595 --> 01:04:26,494
Yes. This one's yours.

723
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:29,064
This one's mine.

724
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:30,332
Keep me updated.

725
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,306
James,

726
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:40,942
you've already talked to one
guy about this thing here.

727
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,978
We checked out your
information from before,

728
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,046
and we're still having
problems coming up

729
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:49,451
A right answer. Something that's
gonna tell us where Sara is.

730
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:52,120
I've talked to your friends.

731
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,054
OK?

732
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,990
You know what happened to her.

733
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:56,524
You were there.

734
01:04:56,526 --> 01:05:00,629
You're the last one to see her.

735
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:05,934
OK. You are the key to
this whole entire thing.

736
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,907
You're telling' me about
hands reaching' up.

737
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:15,043
That feeling that hands are
reaching up and pulling you down

738
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:18,046
while you're going on
this road. OK

739
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,215
It's a legend.

740
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:25,220
[Cop]: What are you seeing?!
Tell me what you're seeing?!

741
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:33,128
She's missing! What
are you seeing?!

742
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:40,068
Something isn't real, dude,
I... Nothing happened.

743
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:44,272
[Cop]: Something happened.

744
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,513
[Cop]: There's no phone
calls, but then again,

745
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,048
there's no phone calls
for you either.

746
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:58,553
So where have you been
during this time frame?

747
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,726
The Jones' are out there
looking for their daughter.

748
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:09,064
You're the only one who can
tell me that sort of thing. OK.

749
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:11,533
Six months we've been
going after this.

750
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,268
Alright.

751
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:36,057
They also told me she did a 180
degree change when she met you.

752
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,325
Straight A student.

753
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,101
We found your
stuff out there.

754
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,003
That's what started
this thing off.

755
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,138
And you're telling me you
woke up out there.

756
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,639
We didn't find
you out there!

757
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:54,042
I don't know if she's dead
or alive. I don't know!

758
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,745
But you're the last
person who does!

759
01:06:56,747 --> 01:07:00,048
And I can't get that from you.

760
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:03,718
I can't understand why
you don't want to help.

761
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,354
You're free to go.

762
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:09,324
But also, remember , this
thing ain't going away.

763
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:13,728
What you're telling' me and in
essence, is absolutely nothing.

764
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,798
I don't know what happened...

765
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,102
You're a fuckin' piece of shit!
[laughter]

766
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,270
He didn't even hit
you in the face.

767
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:23,705
Ow!

768
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,740
Put it out on your,
on his nipple!

769
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:30,745
Ow!

770
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:33,581
Hey, punch me as hard
as you can right here.

771
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,416
He wants to get knocked out.

772
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:41,189
Right here.

773
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,058
Take ten steps back
and fucking charge.

774
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:47,262
[group]: Oh!

775
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:51,533
Put your head down.

776
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:56,438
[group laughing]

777
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,741
Hey, who wants to try to
knock out James?!

778
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,709
I'll try to knock out James!

779
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,711
He's gonna fucking kill me.

780
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:04,779
Knock him out! He wants
to get knocked out!

781
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:07,148
He's been trying all night!

782
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,250
He doesn't care.

783
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,852
If he dies it don't
come back on me.

784
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,392
Oh my god!

785
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,728
K.O.!

786
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:28,369
1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 9! 10!

787
01:08:28,371 --> 01:08:29,838
James is out!

788
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:42,250
<i>[Sara's voice] As you pass</i>
<i>through the sixth gate of Hell,</i>

789
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:47,589
<i>if begins to</i>
<i>take over you.</i>

790
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,891
<i>As you move</i>
<i>forward slowly,</i>

791
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:56,564
<i>It moves upwards, through</i>
<i>your limbs, your stomach.</i>

792
01:08:56,566 --> 01:09:00,702
<i>Your veins boil.</i>

793
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:04,139
<i>And it penetrates you</i>

794
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:07,208
<i>from the inside out.</i>

795
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:10,478
If you don't sacrifice yourself,
<i>it will rip you apart.</i>

796
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,647
<i>You have to let it</i>
<i>take over you.</i>

797
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:17,652
<i>And leave your old self there</i>
<i>on the ground next to you,</i>

798
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,889
so you can finally
reach the end.

799
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:05,700
Everybody thinks
I'm guilty,

800
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,204
and I never,

801
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:14,909
I never thought I was
until, until you showed up.

802
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,849
Am I?

803
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,834
Fuck!

804
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,282
Fuck!

805
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:55,643
<i>When you pass through</i>
<i>the seventh gate of Hell,</i>

806
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,046
<i>you realize that you</i>
<i>are surrounded</i>

807
01:11:58,048 --> 01:12:02,383
<i>by absolute nothingness.</i>

808
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:07,355
<i>There's no time, no pain.</i>

809
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:11,993
Just a great, giant, black void.

810
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:16,331
<i>And you're floating there</i>

811
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:20,435
<i>in the ultimate solitude.</i>

812
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:13,755
Sara!

813
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:19,961
Sara!

814
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,001
Sara!
