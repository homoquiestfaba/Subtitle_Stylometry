That's a bad mix.
And if we don't put a stop to it,

175
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,898
I... I don't think they're gonna make it.

176
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,566
Then we gotta destroy her.

177
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,320
- "We"?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,616
This is Ranger business, not "teenage girl
that has homework due" business, okay?

179
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,410
Wh... She killed Mom.

180
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,537
This is personal.

181
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,374
You know how hard...

182
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,793
- What you don't understand is...
- Let me finish!

183
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,754
If Mom could do it, so can I.

184
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,548
This is her legacy.

185
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,257
I can help.

186
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,220
Minh, I'm really sorry, but you can't.

187
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,721
You're not a Ranger.

188
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,557
Those monsters would overpower you
in a second.

189
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,019
And we can't risk losing you too.
Look, the best thing that you can do

190
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,398
for everyone is to stay out of trouble
and let us sort this out.

191
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,025
Says the guy who caused all this.

192
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:38,322
We all know that if it wasn't for you,
my mom would still be here.

193
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,701
Oh.

194
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,870
That stung, huh?

195
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,373
Good.

196
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,799
Let's get to Cranston Tech.
It has the scanners we need.

197
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,882
Let's go.

198
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,594
[tense music playing]

199
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,477
Drip by drip,
their delicious Ranger powers ebb away.

200
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,856
Let's see how much I've stolen from them.

201
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,190
[machine beeps]

202
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,151
[machine whirring]

203
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,739
[groans] How disappointing.

204
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,741
This process is too slow.

205
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,827
We need as many Rangers as we can get.

206
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,038
[Snizzard]
I can round the lambs up for slaughter.

207
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,541
[Minotaur] Not unless we can find them.

208
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,837
If we can get them to morph,
then it'll be my time to shine.

209
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,842
[Robo Rita] Good thing I know
exactly what draws out a Power Ranger.

210
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,640
[Alpha 9] No T-Rex, no Pterodactyl,
no Green Dragon Power.

211
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,225
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

212
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,062
We'll have to scan for something else
if we want to find our friends.

213
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,230
Thanks, Alpha 9.

214
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,024
Oh, greetings, Zack.

215
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,753
If the people upstairs only knew
they had the world's smartest robot

216
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
right beneath their feet.

217
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,573
Still such a charmer.
It's good to see you again.

218
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,073
Been a while.

219
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,329
I guess life is busy when you're
raising a teenager with attitude.

220
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,998
Oh, Minh definitely has attitude.
Right, Billy?

221
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,708
You all good?

222
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,964
Yeah. It's just,
we haven't been in a mess like this since...

223
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,801
Minh's right.

224
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,180
It really is all my fault
that we lost Trini.

225
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,849
Come on, man.
You were trying to do something good.

226
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,017
Yeah.

227
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,770
And look what happened.

228
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,818
[Alpha 8] Finally, a hit.

229
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,071
Our system is picking up
a powerful presence.

230
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,741
Really? Maybe it's him
or remnants of him from the Z-Wave.

231
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,495
Alpha 8, we've got to converge
the particles and draw them in.

232
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,541
[Alpha 8]
Initializing Z-Wave energy reconstitution.

233
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,627
It's working!

234
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,213
Zordon! Zordon, are you here?

235
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,132
[electricity zapping]

236
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,720
- [explosion rumbles]
- Ah, Billy, I don't think that's Zordon.

237
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,015
[tense music playing]

238
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,439
- [spluttering] Malfunction. Billy.
- Alpha!

239
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,983
[Alpha 8] You have to...

240
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,777
- [Billy] What's happening?
- Get back!

241
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,861
[Billy grunts]

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,616
[Alpha 8] No, no, no!

243
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,077
Yes! [laughs]

244
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,914
After all these years, I'm free!

245
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,792
It's time for revenge.

246
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,543
No.

247
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,838
No, it... it can't be.

248
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,090
[Robo Rita] Fact-check, Billy.

249
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,551
You were looking for your precious Zordon,

250
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,512
but when he sacrificed himself
with the Z-Wave,

251
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:54,310
it wasn't just <i>his </i>particles
that spread across the universe. Get it?

252
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:59,690
The evil was purged from my being,
and the waves scattered it across space.

253
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,527
Until today,
when you put me back together,

254
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,155
and I found a new body.

255
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:11,827
Now, Rita Repulsa will reign again.

256
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,662
- [cackles]
- [grunting]

257
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,707
I need backup at the Command Center.

258
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,917
It's Rita.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,795
- I'll try to lure her outside, but hurry!
- [Robo Rita cackles]

260
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,798
Oh, my poor predecessor.

261
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,383
Look, let's focus on the now.

262
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,859
Robo Rita's a force to be reckoned with.

263
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,513
And we gotta make sure
she doesn't hurt anybody else.

264
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,598
[alarm blaring]

265
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,975
[Alpha 9]
My monster scan has found something.

266
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,644
Looks like a live video feed.

267
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,605
It's not Rita. It's Putties.

268
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,567
And it's not just Angel Grove.
It's all over the world!

269
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,111
We knew she would return.
We're prepared for this.

270
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,948
- Alpha 9, it's time.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,202
- [machine whirring]
- Attention all Power Ranger teams.

272
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,371
Bandora Protocol initiated.

273
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,248
Get to your assigned stations now.

274
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:03,170
If I remember the plan correctly,
visitors in three, two, one.

275
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,050
One minute, I'm helping out
at JJ's junior karate camp,

276
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,804
and the next, I'm sneaking off
to the bathroom to teleport. Seriously?

277
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,890
Bandora Protocol's happening.

278
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,850
Robo Rita's back?

279
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,898
[groans] Come on, guys.
Is this really another training exercise?

280
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,694
Because, hello, I just heated my lunch.

281
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,029
It's not training. Rita is back.

282
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,407
- So Tommy, Jason, Kim are fighting her?
- No.

283
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,327
Unfortunately, they've been captured.

284
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,996
So we need your help.

285
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,333
- [grunting]
- [tense music playing]

286
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,586
"Not a Ranger"? "Not yet," you mean!

287
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,047
[grunting]

288
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,260
You'll pay for what you did, Rita.

289
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,970
[grunts]

290
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,053
[phone beeps]

291
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,434

<i>Monsters known as Putty Patrollers
haven't been seen in Angel Grove</i>

293

294
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,902

[music ends]

301
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,011
It sounds like you barely got away.

302
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,514
And now we have an army of Putties
on our hands. What's next?

303
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,684
It's likely we'll find ourselves
in a Megazord situation soon.

304
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,354
[Alpha 9] Billy and I took months
getting the Sabertooth Tiger Zord working

305
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,898
without a Yellow Ranger.

306
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:50,652
So Dino Megazord is off the table then
without Jace and Kim?

307
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,570
Not quite.

308
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,865
Alpha and I have been experimenting
with secondary connections of the grid.

309
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,535
[Alpha 9] We made these Proxy Power Coins
as a contingency.

310
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,288
Now all of you can use Dino powers.

311
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,373
Whoa. Zordon was very clear.

312
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,794
Duplicating active powers
is very dangerous.

313
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,506
I don't care how dangerous
too much pink energy is. Once a Ranger...

314
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,133
Always a Ranger.

315
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,135
You can definitely count us in.

316
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,348
All right. First up, there's been
injuries reported already in Angel Grove.

317
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,642
We cannot let the Putties
run rampant any longer.

318
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,268
If that's the case,

319
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,604
it's morphin' time!

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,648

00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,941

Now, go, go, Power Rangers!

[Rocky] Hey!

331
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,301
You Putties want a fight? You found one.

[Putties murmuring]

333
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,972
All these years,

00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,986
[Snizzard]
So somebody's morphed, have they?

339
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,781
[Robo Rita]
Are we surprised my Putty bait worked?

340
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,868
There's a reason I'm in charge, you fools.

341
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,539
Go to the grid fluctuation coordinates
and get the Rangers.

342
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:30,169
My masterpiece has a thirst for power,
and those do-gooders will quench it.

343
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,004
[Snizzard] Yes, my queen.

345
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,804
[Snizzard]
Wait, didn't we get Red and Pink?

346
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,140
- [Rocky] Different Red.
- [Kat] Different Pink.

347
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,349
[both] Same powers.

348
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,434
[both grunt]

349
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,605
Careful of Snizzard, Rocky.
Don't get grabbed.

350
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,690
- [Kat grunts]
- [Rocky] Noted.

351
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,653
We'll get you out of here, everybody.
Stay calm.

352
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,405
[Rocky groans]

353
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,867
[Kat grunting]

354
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,077
Back off!

355
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,624
Come on. Run.

356
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,334
Everyone, follow me.

357
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,376
This way.

358
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,172
[Snizzard] Well, look what we have here.

359
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,674
Something to sink my fangs into.

360
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,177
Huh? [grunts] That's not good.

361
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,345
Sweet dreams.

362
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,512
[Billy grunts]

363
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,515
- [Rocky grunts]
- [Snizzard snarls]

364
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,979
- [Snizzard groans] Curses.
- [Billy] Nice rotation on that kick.

365
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,273
- You've still got it.
- I never lost it.

366
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,943
- [Zack] Time to move.
- [Kat] The civilians here are safe.

367
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,486
[Billy] On to the next fight.

368
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,569
[Kat] Ha!

369
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,991
- [Snizzard] They slithered away.
- Who cares?

370
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,119
As long as they're morphed,
I can track them.

371
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,332
<i>- Seems they went to the park.
- A nice place to grab a bite.</i>

372
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,625
[Alpha 9] Oh no.

373
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,420
The team's about to find themselves
in a monster sandwich.

374
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:02,052
<i>This is a worldwide alert
to all Power Rangers.</i>

375
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,637
<i>Minotaur is tracking you.</i>

376
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,682
<i>As long as you're morphed,
he can find you.</i>

377
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,392
<i>You must power down.</i>

378
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,019
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

379
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>- Power down, or he'll find you.</i>
- Got it.

380
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,107
Good work, Alpha.

381
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,443
You all heard that, right?

382
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,654
[Kat] Minotaur's tracking us,
which means...

383
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,615
- Yep.
- [Billy] They followed us here.

384
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,412
- Ruin them, Snizzard.
- My pleasure. [cackles]

385
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,495
[Billy] Power down.

386
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
Untrackable!

387
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,170
- [Minotaur roars]
- [Snizzard snarls]

388
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,089
[Alpha 9] Rangers, look, look.

389
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,717
My new scans picked up activity

390
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,928
in a concentrated spot
on the lunar surface.

391
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,847
Rita's Moon Palace.

392
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,557
If she's making herself at home,

393
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,143
then our friends
and Rita's machine must be there too.

394
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,894
- [machine beeping]
- [Rocky] What's that?

395
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,730
[Alpha 9] It's an incoming call.

396
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,317
<i>We got the Protocol alert.</i>

397
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,986
<i>Our ship is zooming to you
from the Sirius System.</i>

398
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,905
<i>I'm afraid it'll be six hours
before we reach your side of the galaxy.</i>

399
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,407
<i>Then we'll be in teleport range.</i>

400
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,618
<i>Unfortunately, Robo Rita's timing
is the worst.</i>

401
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,870
It always is.

402
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,706
<i>So she got Jason, Kimberly, and Tommy.</i>

403
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,959
<i>It's rough, especially for you, Kat.</i>

404
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,963
I'm not gonna tell JJ
what happened to his father

405
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,296
'cause he'll be home soon.

406
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,175
We're going to get Tommy...
All of them back today.

407
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,594
[Aisha] <i>Right, you've got this.</i>

408
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,056
<i>Oh, and Billy,
that stealth tech you designed for us,</i>

409
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,391
<i>it's a game changer. Thank you.</i>

410
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,517
You're very welcome.

411
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,301
<i>Being invisible has definitely helped
our team's run-ins</i>

412
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,855
<i>with the Troobian Empire.</i>

413
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,440
Safe travels. Okay?

414
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>Thanks. And good luck.</i>

415
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,072
So, what now?

416
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,033
Well, there's still Putties in town.

417
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,534
In every town.

418
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,286
We can't morph.

419
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,956
[sighs] People aren't safe.

420
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,375
[people screaming on monitor]

421
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,959
- We gotta do something.
- Look...

422
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,714
Now, we know Rita's on the Moon, right?
So why not let's just go there?

423
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,215
Crash her party.

424
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,676
Snizzard and Minotaur will get in the way.

425
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,638
Unless we can draw them out.

426
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,265
That's a good thought.

427
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,351
I bet you I can develop something

428
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,312
that will keep them away from the Moon
and keep them away from us.

429
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,816
I bet you I can use stealth technology
I developed for Adam and Aisha.

430
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,778
I bet you can too, Billy.
Love that big brain of yours.

431
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,199
They're made of metal, right?
Maybe we can exploit that.

432
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,534
Oh no.

433
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,163
[Billy] Is that... Minh?

434
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,664
Minh!

435
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,458
[Alpha 9] Ay, ay, ay!

[woman screaming]

441
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,598
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

442
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,476
You guys are in for a treat.

443
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,647
It's morphin' time!

444
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,983
Sabertooth Tiger!

461
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,259
Messing with this place was a big mistake.

Minh.

[scoffs]

475
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,280
- I wanted to be like Mom.
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

476
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,992
[sighs] Let's go.

<i>You were right. It's just what we need.</i>

479
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,185
The others got back from the youth center.
We'll head over and get set up soon.

480

[Kat] <i>Okay, great. See ya.</i>

481
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,212
Awesome place.

482
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,215
Who knew Cranston Tech
was hiding all this?

483
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,885
Not the public and not my employees.

484
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,888
This place is secret,
so let's, uh, keep it that way. Okay?

485
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,477
She's gonna need a talk.

486
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,979
Can I help?

487
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,441
Thanks. I got this.

488
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,111
- The plan needs you. It's urgent.
- Agreed.

489
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,363
- All right. We'll be back soon.
- All right.

490
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,328
[Alpha 9] Pleasure to meet you.

491
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,288
- I am...
- [Zack] I'm sorry, Alpha.

492
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,000
- Can we have the room?
- No problem, Zack.

493
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,919
My sensors are detecting a vibe.

494
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,505
Come on.

495
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,341
Give it to me.

496
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
[scoffs]

497
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,353
If I thought this
was gonna get you in trouble,

498
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,142
I never would have told you the truth.

499
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,310
- But Billy...
- What?

500
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,853
He insisted.

501
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,397
He thought it'd be good for you.
Closure and all that.

502
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,734
But here we are, in a full-on crisis,
and you're trying to play Ranger.

503
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,069
What's wrong with that?

504
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,738
All of you and Mom
did exactly the same thing.

505
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,990
I'm just following her example.

506
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,242
Isn't that a good thing? [scoffs]

507
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,369
[Zack sighs]

508
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,626
What do you think it means to be a Ranger?
Kicking butt? Cute quips? Having fun?

509
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,002
It's hard.

510
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,754
I know.

511
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,050
But someone needs to dole out justice
on the bad guys.

512
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,345
Rita killed Mom.

513
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,514
She needs to go down.

514
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,850
And I'm ready. I'm happy to do it.

515
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,060
Whatever it takes.

516
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,397
So why won't that thing let me morph?

517
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Minh... [sighs]

518
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:17,028
What you're feeling, what you want,
it's not justice. It's revenge.

519
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,699
When I was your age, my mentor told me
that only monsters seek revenge.

520
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,703
That's what Robo Rita is doing now.
She was defeated by the Rangers.

521
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,580
Now she wants to even the score
and hurt us as much as she can.

522
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,793
That's why she... did what she did to Trini.

523
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,966
A mission of revenge can never end well.
That's not what I want for you.

524
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,429
What about what I want?

525
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,348
Maybe it's not your call.

526
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
You wanna be a hero?

527
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,147
It's a selfless path.

528
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,443
It's not always easy. But I do my best.

529
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,699
Setting aside your ambitions
can be a good thing.

530
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,828
Like me, making sure
that you have a good life and a home.

531
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,916
It was worth giving up
your career in Congress... for me?

532
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,754
You are absolutely worth it.

533
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,717
And if you can understand that,
then you can understand

534
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,928
how hard Billy is trying to fix
what he set in motion.

535
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,893
Zordon sacrificed himself for us long ago.

536
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,020
You never met him.

537
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,355
He was our mentor but almost

538
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,356
a father figure.

539
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,070
Billy was trying to bring him back.
He didn't know this would happen.

540
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,951
I... I didn't know that's how he felt.

541
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,665
Just stay here
while we execute our plan. Okay?

542
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,918
Yeah.

543
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,796
And don't worry.
We've saved the world before.

544
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,879
[chuckles]

545
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,928
[machine beeping]

546
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,350
Now it'll really pack a punch.

547
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,895
All right, Kat. Lift her up.

548
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,524
[crane whirring]

549
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,948
So, uh, this thing is used
to sort old scrap, huh?

550
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,031
[chuckles] Yeah.

551
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,661
Well, Minotaur and Snizzard
sure fit that definition.

552
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,873
All right, we're set.

553
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,837
Let's bait the trap.

554
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,214
[tense music playing]

555
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,716
It's morphin' time! Triceratops!

556
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,635
- Pterodactyl!
- Tyrannosaurus!

557
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,306
[Billy] All right, we're set.

558
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,851
They could be here any second,
so look sharp.

559
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,269
- [Kat] Hm.
- [Rocky] Always do.

560
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,815
[Robo Rita] Every Ranger we capture
gives us another boost to the finish line.

561
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:03,361
It's funny. I never believed in
their whole teamwork thing,

562
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,655
but together, they are more.

563
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,199
More power for me, that is.

564
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,200
[alarm blaring]

565
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,580
[Minotaur growls] Another three Rangers
just morphed in Angel Grove.

566
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,583
- [Snizzard] Shall we?
- [Robo Rita] Just go, then.

567
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,461
Oh, higher power levels than I thought.

568
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,591
[Billy] Bingo.

569
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,426
[Minotaur] Surprise, Rangers.

570
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,386
[Billy] Oh, right there is perfect.

571
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,808
- [Minotaur and Snizzard groaning]
- [Rocky laughs]

572
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,853
[Snizzard groans] What is this?

573
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,314
[Kat] Like your hairy friend said,
a surprise.

574
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,941
[Minotaur] Thanks. I hate it.

575
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,402
[Kat] Bye now! Ha!

576
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,823
- [Rocky laughing] Yes, the trap's holding.
- Affirmative.

577
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,410
The powerful electromagnetic field
will prevent them from teleporting away.

578
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,579
Phase one, dusted. Yes!

579
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,663
Good job.

580
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,166
[machine beeping]

581
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,335
Wait. Hold up. You're letting them live?

582
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,963
That doesn't seem right, does it?
What if they get loose?

583
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,340
This is the plan.

584
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,509
Look, all-out destruction
is rarely the most optimal strategy.

585
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,680
Now, where are
those stealth tech projectors?

586
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,975
[Alpha 9] Sorry.
I got lost in the vault again.

587
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,521
These are one use only, so be careful.
Click here, and it projects

588
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,025
a subatomic diffraction field that covers
infrared and ultraviolet light.

589
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,568
- So we'll be invisible.
- Yep.

590
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,656
- Ah, love it.
- Rita will never <i>see </i>phase two coming.

591
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,491
- [laughs]
- Robot's got jokes.

592
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,369
We'll be back soon, and when that happens,
I need you to be here.

593
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,912
Alpha will keep you company.

594
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,913
Hm.

595
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,711
- [Rocky] Nice.
- [Billy] Let's make it quick.

596
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,464
- Alpha, send us to Rita's lair.
- [Alpha 9] On it.

597
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,716
- [Rocky] Ah, that's my foot!
- [Alpha 9] Oops.

598
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,259
- [Kat] Ow.
- [Alpha 9] Sorry.

599
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,220
I know I have heavy feet.

600
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,303
[machine beeps]

601
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,475
Better get ready for what's coming.

602
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,436
[Snizzard, Minotaur groaning]

603
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,647
Uncle Zack told me
what being a hero means.

604
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,816
[Alpha 9] Guess I'll warm up the volcano.

605
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,444
- Mind if I borrow?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

606
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,196
- Okay. Thanks. Bye.
- But...

607
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,864
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

608
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,491
[up-tempo music playing]

609
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,581
Maybe too much of a flex.

610
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,541
Overdone.

611
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,216
Hm.

612
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,471
[folk music playing on radio]

613
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,347
Come on!

614
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,934
Why won't you fly?

615
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,310
[folk music ends]

616
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,979
[man 1] Hey! Hey!

617
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,814
Help!

618
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,941
They're after my boyfriend! That way!

619
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,820
- Hero practice won't hurt.
- [man 1] Please!

620
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,822
- [grunts]
- [tense music playing]

621
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,905
[Minh] Woo-hoo!

622
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,829
Where is he?

623
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,627
[man 2 grunts]

624
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:08,921
Move! Move!

625
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,465
[man 2 grunts]

626
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,135
[man 2 screams]

627
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,678
[Minh groans]

628
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,347
Yeah!

629
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,266
[chuckles] What a mess.

630
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,728
[triumphant music playing]

631
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,811
Whoa!

632
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,522
- [man 1] George!
- Ah!

633
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,195
[chuckles]

634
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,031
[George exhales]

635
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,575
[music ends]

636
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,708
[Minotaur grunting] Somebody's lost.

637
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,669
[Snizzard]
Hey, girlie, did you take a wrong turn?

638
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,964
You don't remember me from the cemetery?
You messed with my people.

639
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,592
And your boss killed my mom.

640
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,095
[Snizzard]
We work for an intergalactic war criminal.

641
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,097
You'll need to be a lot more specific.

642
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,101
I'm Minh Kwan. And you're about to face

643
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,478
the Sabertooth Tiger!

644
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,233
- [Minotaur and Snizzard laughing]
- Wha...? I'm doing the world a favor.

645
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,735
- Sabertooth Tiger!
- [both laugh]

646
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,987
Now, what do we have here?

647
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,573
Another kid playing the hero.

648
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,576
I tend to make that difficult.

649
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,411
Ask your mom.

650
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,582
If I can't morph, then I'll take you down
the old-fashioned way.

651
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,168
[tense music playing]

652
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,505
[screams]

653
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,508
- [Robo Rita grunts]
- [Minh grunting]

654
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,679
[grunts]

655
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,473
[Robo Rita]
Praying Mantis style. Just like Trini.

656
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,894
[grunts] Tell me, child.

657
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,731
Does being squashed like a bug
run in the family?

658
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,610
[Minh screams]

659
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,531
[Minh grunts]

660
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,575
[Minh groans]

661
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:07,582
Playtime's over. [cackles]

662
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,917
[ominous music playing]

663
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,921
[zapping]

664
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,258
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Putties murmuring]

665
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,180
- [Kat grunts]
- [Putties murmuring]

666
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,390
- [Rocky grunts]
- [Zack grunts]

667
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
Whoa.

668
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,067
Well, it looks like
we've got Rita's little science project

669
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,319
all to ourselves now.

670
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:40,072
Perhaps. Our distraction might've worked
for now, but it's not gonna last long.

671
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,824
[Rocky sighs] Oh man.

672
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,577
They got a lot more Rangers
than I expected.

673
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,289
- [machine beeps]
- Snizzard is a piece of work.

674
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,001
Tommy, look at you.

675
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,587
Kat. No.

676
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,884
- Snizzard created these snakes.
- [Kat] What does your scanner say?

677
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,596
My readings show that their energy
is connected to our friends.

678
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,349
If we don't destroy that monster,

679
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,643
we can't move any of them
without causing them harm.

680
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,770
- So back to the junkyard or...?
- What is that?

681
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,856
Oh no.

682
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,610
That's what she's been up to.

683
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:21,239
[Rocky] Is that some kind of space barrel?

684
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,658
No, it's, uh... it's a space dumpster.

685
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,410
Rita's creating a time portal.

686
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,872
- That's what she came out of when we...
- Yes, when Zordon recruited us.

687
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,208
So Rita's trying to contact
her younger self.

688
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,001
But why?

689
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,963
- [Robo Rita] Why? So many reasons.
- [Billy, Kat gasp]

690
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,007
- What? Minh! Are you okay?
- [Minh grunting]

691
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:44,387
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- Shush. The adults are talking.

692
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:50,059
Have you figured it out, Billy?
Or has my genius surpassed even you?

693
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,979
Let me guess. A Rita reunion

694
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,439
and then some scheme
to conquer the galaxy?

695
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,565
[Robo Rita] Not bad.

696
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:01,779
I'll pass through this portal and give
years of knowledge to my younger self,

697
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,283
making us absolutely unstoppable.

698
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:09,453
We'll kill your do-gooding teenage selves
in their sleep

699
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,374
before Zordon even thinks
to make you Rangers.

700
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,461
You think you can rewrite 30 years
of history with some tin-pot gadget?

701
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,379
Careful.

702
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,591
Your friends are charging my machine
faster than I could have dreamed,

703
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,428
so I don't need you anymore.

704
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,638
I'll take out Snizzard.
You get the others.

705
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,892
You know, your mom
will be a first for me, Minh.

706
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,729
I've never killed anyone twice before.

707
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,063
Hold that thought.

708

714
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,749
[Minotaur laughing] Yes.

715
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,002
[Robo Rita] Stop that.

716
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,712
[Billy groaning]

717
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,716
- [grunts]
- [Robo Rita] Oh, Cranston.

[whimpers]

719
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,386
What a waste!

720
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,890
Trini died for you.

721
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,518
And now you'll share her fate.

722
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,270

No!

[Robo Rita] Yes, yes.

729
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,250
This brings back memories.

730
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,252
[Zack] Minh?

[somber instrumental music playing]

732
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,135
[Kat] Oh, please, no.

733
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,764
[Robo Rita, mockingly] What a tragedy.

734
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,266
That's what being selfless gets you.

735
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,485
[Zack] Minh, can you hear us?

736
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,195
Minh?

Mom?

- [panting] I saw...
- [Kat] Oh, thank goodness.

742
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,633
No way.

743
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,678
What is this?

[Minh breathing heavily]

745
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,101
- You know what this means, right?
- Go on.

746
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,936
You wanna say it?

747
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,938
Are you kidding?

[Minh] Whoa, it actually worked.

757
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,042
- [Zack] You're a Ranger.
- [Minh] A legit Ranger.

758
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,545
Putties, surround them.

[Putties murmuring]

760
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,510
[Billy] Time for phase three of the plan.

761
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,970
[Kat] Did we plan a phase three?

762
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,307
[Minh] Let me guess.
Phase three is laying the smackdown?

763
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,391
Precisely.

764
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,101
[Rocky] Bring it.

00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,895
[Minotaur growls]

766
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,148
Maybe watching you die
will cure my headache.

- [Rocky] Kat, you're clear.
- Thanks, Rock.

776
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,691
Uh, uh, uh. Think twice.

777
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,861
You don't want to hurt
your tiny little friends.

778
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,425
[Billy] She's right. To free them,
we have to destroy Snizzard.

779
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,908
Good luck with that. [grunts]

788
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,979
She's distracted.

789
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,898
Let's see them try to... [grunts, groans]

790
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,610
[screams]

791
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,030

Can you handle that hairy bot?

- [Zack] Oh, easy.
- [Minotaur growls]

797
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,211
- Anything I can do?
- You're with me. We're going big.

00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,434
So how the heck do you drive this thing?

809
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,018
[Billy] Do what I do.

810
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,480
- You'll find it's second nature.
- [Minh] Okay.

811

[Billy] Don't let up.

821
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:56,360
[Snizzard groans]
So you're fighting dirty.

822
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:57,944
Yes!

823
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,823

- Got him.
- [Kat] I'm not gonna lie, Rocky.

830
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,092
That was... pretty hardcore.

831
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,885
[Zack] Well, beef is off the menu.

832
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,596
[Rocky] Billy, how's the reptile?

833
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,392
As cold-blooded as ever.
But we have room for three more in here.

834
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,560
[Rocky] Copy that.

835
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,895
[Snizzard] So it's just me left.

836
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,898
Good, I'll have you all to myself.

837
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,151
[Kat] Oh yeah.

838
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,945

They thought they could stop me,
but my masterpiece is fully charged.

Finally, I can rule
with my younger, prettier self.

00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,654
I can't wait to see me again.

[grunts] Can we get
this thing on its feet?

00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,163
Is that what I think it is?

00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,707
[Rocky] Oh, great, the portal.

854
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,958
We gotta move. [grunts]

855
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,961
[Billy] System's back online.
Just have to... There.

856
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,837
Up we go.

Mega Power Sword. Now!

858
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:56,438
Now they will come,
and then she will be free.

00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,191

And so it begins.

865
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,958
[Zack] What do you think?
Time to end this?

866
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,251

[Snizzard growls]

869
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,640
[Snizzard groans] My circuits, they burn!

870
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,437
Oof! What a way to go.

871
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,483
No, my Snizzard. And my snakes.

872
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,531
But no matter,
the Rita renaissance begins!

873
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:53,036
<i>Ah! After ten thousand years, I'm free!</i>

874
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,664
[Minh] Sit down. Shut up!

875
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,747
Huh?

876
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,876
[groans, winces]

877
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,044
Rocky, get the other Rangers. Quick.

878
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,212
[Rocky] Right behind you.

879
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,214
- Take the shot, Kat.
- What?

880
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,133
[Kat] With pleasure. [grunts]

881
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,679
<i>Time to conquer Ea...</i>

882
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,639
I'll kill you all!

883
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,600
Shut her down. Do it, Zack.

884
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,018
This is for Trini.

885
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,813
[screams]

886
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,651
[Minh] Is that it? Is she gone?

887
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,738
[Billy] Affirmative. It's over.

888
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,284
[Zack] Like I said, Minh,
we always save the world.

889
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,163
[Alpha 9] You missed all the action,
but I'm glad you made it.

890
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:40,500
All the rescued Rangers
are secure in your spaceship's med bay

891
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,377
and in stable condition.

892
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,005
Well, our course for Aquitar is all set.

893
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,466
The Aquitians will fix them up in no time.

894
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,593
You sure you don't wanna join us, Billy?

895
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:52,054
You know, uh,
Cestria did say she missed you.

896
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,932
[chuckles] No. But I'll be there soon.

897
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,095
I still have some company matters
that I gotta tie up

898
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,478
before I can get back
to my old adventures.

899
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,064
Look at you.
You've missed the travel, haven't you?

900
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,483
It is nice
to have something new to focus on.

901
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,862
But once the Aquitians get everyone
back to normal size and back in action,

902
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,405
all of this will be over.

903
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:14,201
Yeah, it's been a wild ride,
but I'm ready to get back to JJ.

904
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:18,705
Being a parent is almost as challenging
as being a Ranger. [chuckles]

905
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,208
You think that's tough?
I didn't even get lunch.

906
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,836
- Somebody threw out my noodles.
- Sorry, sorry.

907
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,173
Relax. Relax. Don't blow a circuit.
I'm just kidding.

908
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,800
Even though they're small,

909
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,177
we shouldn't keep
our fellow Rangers waiting.

910
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,221
It was great catching up.

911
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,144
I'm glad the Sabertooth Tiger legacy
is in great hands.

912
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,104
It's an honor.

913
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,441
[Alpha 9] Time to fire up the teleporter?

914
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,319
- Yeah.
- [Kat] Sounds good. Let's go, Rocky.

915
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,780
[Alpha 9]
Inputting all of your coordinates now.

916
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,158
Until next time,
may the power protect you all.

917
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,784
[all] And you.

918
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,416
[Billy] So what do you think
of your communicator?

919
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,043
Love the vintage aesthetic.

920
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,714
And if I'm late for class,
teleporting will be clutch.

921
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,133
Uh, only if no one's looking, okay?

922
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,759
- Okay.
- [Billy chuckles]

923
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,929
Look at this place.
I mean, it's as if nothing's changed.

924
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,223
It's just a little bit...
I don't know, smaller, maybe.

925
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,225
Maybe we've grown.

926
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,522
You two want smoothies? I wanna know
if they still have Ernie's recipe.

927
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,045
- [chuckles] Sure.
- Sure. [chuckles]

928
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,573
Can I get you anything while I'm away?
A souvenir from Mirinoi, maybe.

929
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,949
I don't know. [chuckles]

930
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,161
You won't be gone too long, will you?

931
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,330
Mom always said she missed you
when you were in space.

932
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,917
I mean, I'll miss you and...

933
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,420
Um...

934
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,505
Minh?

935
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,259
It's just, before you go,

936
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,304
all that stuff...

937
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,557
Mom's passing.

938
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,853
I said it was your fault,
and that wasn't fair.

939
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:10,984
You couldn't have known what would happen
to Rita or what would happen to Mom.

940
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,949
You didn't say anything about me
I haven't told myself a million times.

941
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,953
No, but for real.
I should be thanking you.

942
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,124
If you hadn't pushed Zack
to share the truth about Mom...

943
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,712
I don't know
how I would have handled everything.

944
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,882
You're a good kid.

945
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,302
We're all looking out for you.

946
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,138
And I'm really glad
you looked out for me too.

947
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,848
You mean Rita's blast?

948
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,683
I had to.

949
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,601
You're family.

950
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,729
Gotta protect your family.

951
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,856
Family, huh?

952
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:55,195
Is that why you thought it was okay
to borrow my flying car?

953
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,489
Okay, that was Ranger business.

954
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,824
Ah. [chuckles]

955
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,993
I'm sorry. The Radbug
is proprietary technology.

956
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,455
- You're grounded.
- [chuckles] You think you can ground me?

957
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,596
[chuckles] No, it doesn't work like that.

958
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,960
- You're grounded.
- Look at you two. [laughs]

959
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,795
Oh man.

960
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,420
[sighs]

961
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,883
She's so much like...

962
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,013
Trini would be proud.

963
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,768
You just reminded me.

964
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,229
After Rita blasted me,

965
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,898
I got a weird flash.

966
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,277
These memories.

967
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,361
Memories?

968
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,155
[Minh] Yeah, from the Morpher.

969
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,615
Of you and Mom being Rangers.

970
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,201
Being heroes.

971
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,495
I mean, it's in optimal condition.

972
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,706
Nothing out of the ordinary,
but who knows?

973
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,293
The morphing grid
is a pathway to infinite possibilities.

974
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,504
[chuckles]
Maybe I shouldn't give up on Zordon.

975
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,840
What were the memories like?

976
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,384
It was weird. I...

977
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,260
It was like

978
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,055
I felt how much all of you meant to her.

979
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,350
[Zack] She meant a lot to us too.

980
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,353
She was... a great friend.

981
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:11,937
The best.

982
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,522
The best.

983
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,170
I wouldn't even be here
if she didn't overcome her fear of heights

984
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,029
and get me out
of a really nasty cliffhanger.

985
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,156
Mom was afraid of heights?

986
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,201
Okay. What else didn't she tell me?

987
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,118
[chuckles]

988
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,954
That time Shellshock made her run,
and she couldn't stop.

The weirdo
with the traffic light on his back?

990

A traffic-light man?

991
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,211
No, it wasn't a man. It was a turtle.
