He calls me up with computer questions.

We could get a drink at a bar,
we could stay here.

241

He's like a friend. He's fun to hang out with.

to joke about it?

No, I know. I'm just saying,
since you said "less Jewish-Iooking,"

320

think I look Italian.

347
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,840
<i>Sure. Okay.</i>

348
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,930
Um...

349
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,904
Is there a bar you
know we can go to?

350
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,644
<i>There's one near my apartment,</i>
<i>but it's pretty lame.</i>

351
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,945
Okay.

352
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,545
<i>It's in Culver City.</i>
<i>Do you want to meet me there?</i>

353
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,953
I don't drive.

354
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,256
Those are all
kind of cheesy.

Oh.

00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,435

358
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,611
Do you mind if we stop by my house?
I left my purse. Sorry.

359
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,641
Do you need it?

360
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,578
I still get carded.

361
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,622
I don't read enough.

362
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,795

of the rare times

happy around my dad.

366

I want to have
a relationship with her,

371
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,478
she's just not
that friendly with me.

372
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,218

I got her these puppets for her birthday.

373
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,053
They might be too old.
They have sticks.

374
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,426
Yeah. I'm sure
they'll be fine.

00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,866
Okay, you don't
want to go to the bar?

379
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,336
It's Friday.
The bars are probably

380
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,168
full of bridge
and tunnel people.

381
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,574
Or whatever the LA version
of bridge and tunnel is.

382
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,940

383
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,317
I don't really have...

384
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:25,219
There's a Corona Light and some
cheap tequila someone left here once.

385
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,284
Shall we split
the Corona?

386
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,521

Don't worry about it.

390
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,053
I'm wearing kind
of an ugly bra.

It's like an ACE bandage.
There's no clasp.

392

Do you hear a train?

393
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,478
Is that a train?

394
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,455

397
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,125
I'm sorry,
it's just that...

398
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,000
I just got out of
a long relationship,

399
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,301
and I don't want to
go from just having sex

400
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,569
to just having sex
to just having sex.

401
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,743
Who's the third
"just having sex"?

402
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,807
You, if we had sex.

403
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,816
Okay,
then who's the second?

404
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,412
A guy I met at
this gallery thing.

405
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,454
You slept with him?

406
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,561
Yeah, I did.

407
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,224
How did that go?

408
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,032
What do you mean?
The sex?

409
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,568
Yeah. Well...

410
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,206
It was pretty awkward.

411
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,610
What is that
on your lip?

412
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,745
What?

413
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,418
Is that a...
Nothing.

414
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,990
No, it's not a cold sore.
You sure?

415
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,755
Yeah, I picked it.

416
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,796
Where's your bathroom?

417
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:45,578
This is so annoying,
but I have to call my friend, Gina, back.

418
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,354
Sorry, it's just, if I don't call her back,
then I'll be a bad friend.

419
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,952
She's always got an emergency.
I'm sure it's nothing.

420
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,157
Uh, how far do you think
it would be to walk?

421
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,531
To your brother's?

422
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,593
Way too long, like five miles.
You can stay here.

423
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,571
I have the dog and...

424
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,333
I can drive you.
This will only take a second.

425
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,838
You have to call
her right this moment?

426
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,779
Won't she understand
you're in the middle of a...

427
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,682
No, no.
I'll take you now. Sorry.

428
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,982
You know, I... You don't have to do that.
You've got your robe...

429
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,612
Oh, no.
It's not a problem.

430
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,054
I can probably call a cab.

431
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,284
Okay.

432
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,322
This is stupid.

433
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:28,627
I'm singing this Saturday at this
place on Orange and Sunset.

434
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,635
I mean, if you feel like it.
I know it's last minute.

435
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,732
Oh, my friend Gina
made the flyers

436
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,775
and she wrote down
the address wrong.

so it's kind of hard to pinpoint.

do this again.

do nothing right now.

They seem kind of busy.

519
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,821
Should I go ask?

520
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,597
If you want.

521
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:30,595

Oh.

00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,794
Okay.

but...

Hi.

526
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,840
Do you know how much longer for Mahler?

527
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,180
You know,
I think we're just waiting

528
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,446

get out of the room.

529
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,810
Okay.

530
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,525
She thinks that
they're just waiting

531
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,995
for a doctor to
get out of the room.

532
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,123
Yeah, I could hear her.
Okay.

533
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,827
DOCTOR: I think
it's sciatica.

534
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,838
FLORENCE: Yeah,
he's had that before.

535
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,342
But his eyes are jaundiced,
so I'd like to run some tests

536
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,141
and I will keep him overnight just
to make sure everything is okay.

537
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,409
And I imagine you can
bring him home tomorrow.

He was supposed
to come home today,

550
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:49,474
but the numbers dropped and they
wanna keep him until he's stable.

551
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,538

00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,870
but outside the office,

688
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,709
you'd start to wonder if she was
as cute as you'd imagined.

689
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,408
I'm just saying,
you know, Fabula is

690
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,451
a lot less possessive
than she used to be.

691
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:42,712
You'd like her more now.

692
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,081
Can I get another Scotch?

693
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,554
That's the busboy.

694
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,990
Fine, can I get another fork?
This one has some food on it.

695
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,824
Fabula never got you.

696
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,760
She thought she'd bagged
some fancy British guy

697
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,492
rather than just Ivan.

698
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,124
I know she helped you with
the addiction and everything,

699
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,793
but you're over that now.

700
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,461
We have to find you someone.

701
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,366
It's too bad neither of us
are the type to go whoring.

702
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,430
Is that her?

703
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,237
Hi.
Hi.

704
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,281
This is Ivan.

705
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,717
Hello.
It's nice to meet you.

706
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,550
Hi. Hello.
Hi.

707
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,250
Sorry.
Sorry.

708
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,189
I'll be right back.

709
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,558
GIRL: <i>Hello?</i>
Beth.

710
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:32,991
<i>What?</i>

711
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,393
Beth?

712
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:35,694
<i>Who?</i>

713
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,697
Is this a child?

714
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,599
<i>Yes.</i>

715
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,342
Is your mom there?

716
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,445
<i>Who is this?</i>

717
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,709
Roger.

718
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:46,772
<i>Miller?</i>

719
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,709
Roger.

720
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,515
<i>Mom, it's Miller!</i>

721
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,883
BETH: <i>Hello?</i>
Beth.

722
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,751
<i>Who's this?</i>

723
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,021
Roger.

724
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,187
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

725
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,319
What are you doing?

726
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,897
<i>I'm sewing Charles' pants.</i>

727
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,560
Uh-huh.
Is Charles your son?

728
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,894
<i>Yeah. Hot stuff.</i>

729
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,073
Are you sewing
his Flash suit?

730
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,269
Is he the devil
or the Flash? Did he say?

731
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:16,768
<i>Yeah.</i>

732
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,212
How's the rest of
your week looking?

733
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,051
What'd you do with her?
She's in the bathroom.

734
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,359
You see what I mean
about working in an office?

735
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,450
Where'd you go?

736
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,551
I called Beth.

737
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,994
Really? Come on, I mean,
Beth is a part of my life.

738
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,053
She's...

739
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,091
I don't believe that things happen for a reason,
but maybe

740
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,400
me being out here at
this particular time,

741
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,742
it's happening for a reason.

742
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,778
(ALL LAUGHING)

743
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,975
I cannot believe
you still have this.

744
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,211
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
And I got you this.

745
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,150
ROGER: Wow. "The Magic Marker.
Live!" Man, look at Beller.

746
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,521
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
How is Lenny?

747
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,624
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Lenny not so good.

748
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,159
IVAN: You've got a bit of
a mullet going on there.

749
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,697
No, I think
that's a shadow.

750
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,289
You're trying so
hard to look casual.

751
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,631
(SINGING) <i>Happy birthday</i>
<i>to you</i>

752
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,898
No, don't have them
do that. Don't.

753
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,940
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

754
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,133
Don't.

755
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,641
You're such
a fucking asshole.

756
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,699
Roger, relax.

757
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,905
You know I hate this shit.
Will you stop? No...

758
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,438
Okay?

759
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,212
Sit on my dick, asshole!

760
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,616
(GASPING)

761
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,783
And many more.

762
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,651
What the fuck, right?

763
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,129
Well, he just got out of a mental hospital.
Right.

764
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,157
What? Really?

765
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,967
I mean, who does that?
Gets the waiters.

766
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,239
I'm not one of these
preening LA people

767
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,036
who likes everything
to be about them.

768
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,806
I'm not some dickhead who does
karaoke at the Farmers Market

769
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:59,272
and hosts a running charades
game every Friday night,

770
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,475
and swing dances.

771
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,711
(LAUGHS)

772
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:02,774
What?

773
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,821
You told Ivan to
sit on your dick.

774
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,648
Did I?
Yeah.

775
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,356
What the hell
does that mean?

776
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,555
(LAUGHING)
I don't know.

777
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,924
Okay.

778
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:20,892
Now,

779
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,096
happy birthday.

780
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,673
Great.

781
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,873
So, I got the witch.

782
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,841
Thanks.

783
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,407
I made a snap judgment.

784
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,976
If you'd rather the devil,
you can switch it out.

785
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,386
No, I'm happy
with the witch.

786
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,525
You're right,
these are too old for your niece.

787
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,691
I'm impressed by you.

788
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:49,958
In what way?

789
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,159
I don't know.

790
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,567
I mean, you seem
really fine doing nothing.

791
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:57,971
It's like you don't feel all that
bullshit pressure to be successful.

792
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,107
I mean,
by other people's standards.

793
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,035
I'm...

794
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,906
You know, I almost had a record
deal when I got out of college.

795
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,478
I haven't done nothing.

796
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,145
Cool.

797
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,950
I want to be
doing nothing.

798
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,615
I'm doing
nothing deliberately.

799
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,090
That's what I'm saying.

800
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,525
I don't know that
I could do nothing

801
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,324
and be that cool
with everything.

802
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,860
Well, there's so
much crap out there.

803
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,531
Mahler's not at home.

804
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,870
You could stay over.

805
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:33,836
Wink-wink.

806
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:36,835
Um...

807
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:38,908
I'm not supposed to...

808
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,376
I try not to...

809
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,014
But, fuck it.
Yeah, okay.

810
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,793
Ivan's nice.

811
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,665
Is he your best friend?

812
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,068
Yeah, I guess so.

813
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,500
I lost Ivan
there for a few years

814
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,602
to this racist
he met in rehab.

815
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,947
But their marriage is ending,
which is good for him,

816
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,077
and me, to be honest.

817
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:18,143
Good.

818
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,245
You probably
wouldn't believe this,

819
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,881
but in college we
all looked up to him.

820
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,354
He was from England

821
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,328
and he used to be
really handsome and stylish

822
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,455
and kind of great.
I can believe that.

823
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,898
Ivan and I call each other "man,"
but it's meant as a joke.

824
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,727
It's the kind of thing
we wouldn't say, 'cause...

825
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,271
It's our imitation
of other people.

826
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,968
I know what that's like.

827
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,066
This friend of mine,
Marnie, and me,

828
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,000
we went...

829
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,778
We went to this
cheesy bar in Hollywood

830
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,811
and we just thought,

831
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,879
"Let's pretend to
be these slutty girls

832
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,424
"who are looking
to get picked up,

833
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,891
"even though we're not."

834
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,958
And we end up talking to these two frat guys,

835
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,760
but, like, 30.

836
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,758
And they were all
into their bodies

837
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,896
and cologned,
very well-groomed.

838
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:14,103
And we ended up going back
to one of their places.

839
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,406
And I think one of them was, like,
almost retarded,

840
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,008
or else he was really drunk,

841
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,450
because he
didn't make any sense.

842
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,786
And they got out
this video camera

843
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,252
and Marnie and I,
we did this kind of striptease.

844
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,853
And it was crazy

845
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,422
because we were still
playing these girls,

846
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,902
but there we were,
showing our breasts...

847
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,407
And then,

848
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,808
we ran out of there pretty fast.
We were total freaks.

849
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,212
You never have
anything good to drink.

850
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,453
You know,
that's like the stupidest story I've ever heard.

851
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,658
It's just...

852
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,320
Bye.

853
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,961
What?
What is the point of that story?

854
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,093
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

855
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:30,349
FLORENCE: <i>Lots of really</i>
<i>great, interesting people</i>

856

<i>kill themselves.</i>

858

<i>I don't think so.</i>
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

859
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:37,993
Come on,
he's an asshole.

860
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,358
That's a defense.

861
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,659
He's not like us.
He's...

862
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,633
You can tell that a lot of normal
stuff is really hard for him.

863
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:46,999
Like being nice?

864
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,332
I like him.

865
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,270
Should I call him?
No!

866
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,432
I don't like
how he treats you.

867
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,839
He acts like
you work for him.

868
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,342
Well, I work
for his brother.

869
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,336
I don't wanna be rude.

870
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,678
If you keep driving him places,
I'll stop speaking to you.

871
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,310
Okay.

872
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,217
We think it's an autoimmune disorder.
Uh-huh.

873
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:11,158
This hospital,
it has more experience with internal medicine.

874
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,753
I called,
and they're expecting you.

875
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,593
You can't do it here?

876
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,633
I mean, you know him now.

877
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,067
I know,
but he needs to get well.

878
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,229
Thank you. Come on, Mahler.
I know the doctors there.

879
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,829
You'll be in good hands.

880
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,898
This is where we're going.

881
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,967
I got to pick Victor up from
school in half an hour.

882
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,306
Can you ask Florence?

883
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,673
I'm trying
not to call her.

884
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,307
I'm just going to
hurt her feelings, man.

885
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,511
I'm trying not to do
that to people anymore.

886
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,316
And I don't want to be asking
anyone for a ride anymore, ever.

887
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,388
I just turned 41,
I should be able to drive.

888
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,791
Why are you yelling at me?

889
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,062
What a pain in the ass.

890
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,256
Come on, come on.

891
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,997
Survival rate
is about 50-50,

892
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,198
but hopefully with
the right cocktail of drugs,

893
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,266
we'll be able to get it under
control and keep him stable.

894

908
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,707
I always felt bad
about that night

909
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,650
after we played
the Viper Room,

910
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,654
and you were there
with your sister,

911
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,280
and I wanted to
go to that party

912
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,587
and you were tired
and I let you go home.

913
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,648
What night was that?

914
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,092
You were with your sister.

915
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,256
Yeah, I don't...
I don't remember that night.

916
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,526
I should have been
straight with you 'cause

917
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,000
I originally got into
music to meet girls,

918
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,969
and I think when we
were playing around LA

919
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,299
and I was starting to
get some attention...

920
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,839
From girls, yeah.
No, I understand.

921
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,205
Yeah, but I wasn't
clear with you

922
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,540
and I want to apologize
for how I behaved,

923
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,240
'cause I kind
of just let it end,

924
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,805
and left town and was uncommunicative.
Yeah.

925
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,282
And I feel like I didn't even give you a reason...

926
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,411
Yeah, but, you know,
I knew.

927
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:19,944
Well, I'm sorry.

928
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,114
It's okay.

929
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,524
Like I said, I don't
even remember that night.

930
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,427
You had bought a new mattress that afternoon.

931
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,689
(CHUCKLES) Sounds plausible.

932
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,860
I mean, what was it, like,
15 years ago or something?

933
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,394
Yeah, you didn't like the Sealy,
you thought it was too mushy.

934
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,006
We used to make that
1-800-Mattress joke,

935
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,567
"The extra 'S<i>'</i>
for extra sex."

936
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,206
Okay. Okay.

937
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,744
(ROGER LAUGHING)

938
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,716
We could've gotten
married and had kids.

939
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,446
Yeah? Do you think?

940
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,155
I don't think we would've.
Really.

941
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,224
I don't know,
it was a big relationship for me.

942
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,334
So, you're a carpenter now?

943
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,496
Yeah.
I was always good at making things, so...

944
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,560
Oh, yeah?

945
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,967
Beth,

946
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,135
I made you that bed.
Don't you remember?

947
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,102
It was why we were going to
buy the mattress to begin with.

948
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,208
Yes, I do. I do. I do remember that.
I'm sorry. Totally.

949
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,314
Go on.

950
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,548
I work out of
a studio in Bushwick

951
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,648
that I share with a few
other carpenters and that's

952
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,219
been pretty good.

953
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,591
It's political, though.

954
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,685
Um...

955
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,690
What else?

956
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,296
Recently,
I had this thing

957
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,833
where I
couldn't move my legs,

958
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:42,727
literally.

959
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,273
You know,
but it was psychological.

960
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,737
God...

961
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,869
Yeah, so that took
some time dealing with.

962
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,979
I think that
brings us up to date.

963
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:55,944
Are you okay?

964
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,642
Yeah.

965
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,790
I just... I think I need to just let go,
you know?

966
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,557
I had a shrink
there who said,

967
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,228
"You only miss by 5%."

968
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,487
I'm not positive
what it means,

969
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,932
but in most things,
95 is pretty good.

970
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,562
I had a shrink
once who told me,

971
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,098
"You're of value."

972
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,475
It's stupid,
but it always stayed with me.

973
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,108
You look really pretty.

974
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,045
Thanks.

975
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,413
My dog is sick.

976
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,513
Oh, yeah?

977
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,954
My mom is sick.

978
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,016
Phillip's dog, really,
but I'm taking care of him.

979
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,392
He has
an autoimmune disorder.

980
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,955
Since he got sick,
I keep thinking I have something.

981
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,998
I'm sorry about your mom.

982
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,129
Yeah.

983
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,867
I'm glad you're
feeling better.

984
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,039
I get horrible
anxiety sometimes, still.

985
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,011
Yeah, that I remember.

986
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,810
Do you want to
have dinner one night?

987
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,916
This week? Or next.
I kind of meant...

988
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,250
Like, on a date.

989
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,485
Oh.

990
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,494
No. (LAUGHS)

991
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,861
I mean, you know,
that's just a terrible idea.

992
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,399
No. I mean, you know, no.

993
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,228
Hello.

994
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,204
Shit, they just...
They don't even...

995
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,664
She doesn't seem to...

996
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,470
She looks harried
even though no one's here.

997
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,907
I'm just going to
go get her.

998
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,172
I'm sure she'll be by.

999
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,174
Hi. Could you send our bill?

1000
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:48,287
(PHONE RINGING)
<i>What is going on? Okay.</i>

1001
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,991
<i>Water. Water.</i>

1002
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,630
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1003
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,727
Hello.

1004
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,533
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
How is Lenny?

1005
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,198
(IN DEEP VOICE)
Lenny not so good.

1006
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,968
(CHUCKLES)

1007
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,341
<i>Not too late to call,</i>
<i>I hope.</i>

1008
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,401
No.

1009
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:08,008
Watching <i>Just My Luck</i> with
Lindsay Lohan on Starz.

1010
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,244
Mmm. How is it?

1011
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:11,845
<i>Kind of funny.</i>

1012
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,647
She's got charm.

1013
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,813
<i>All right.</i>

1014
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,352
So, I was thinking

1015
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,059
we should maybe
do something together again.

1016
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,261
<i>Write some songs.</i>

1017
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,495
Aren't you going
back to New York?

1018
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,567
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

1019
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,334
If we got something going
I could stay here, possibly.

1020
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,401
<i>I don't know if I've really got time,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

1021
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,471
<i>with the computer</i>
<i>work and Victor.</i>

1022
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,573
Uh-huh.

1023
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,880
Isn't it funny,
don't you still think of yourself as a guitar player

1024
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,783
even though you
don't do it anymore?

1025
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,913
No. No. No, I don't.

1026
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,287
You know,
I've just hired this guy

1027
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,954
called Ezra to help
with the company, so...

1028
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,362
<i>It's just, you know,</i>
<i>I've got to concentrate on that.</i>

1029
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,696
Okay.

1030
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,338
I think I'm having
a party tomorrow.

1031
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,999
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

1032
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,133
A pool party. So, come.

1033
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,438
Bring Victor.

1034
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,671
<i>Pool party? Cool.</i>

1035
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,444
After we hang up,

01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:56,561
Don't give in.

1538
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:59,732
I know it's the harder,
more painful decision to stay free,

1539
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,604
but that's what
adulthood is.

1540
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:02,973
I mean, I could
just stay with Florence

1541
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,671
because it's easy,
but I don't want easy.

1542
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:06,771
You've been dating
Florence for a month.

1543
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:09,214
I've been married for
10 years with a child.

1544
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,478
Don't tell me
about adulthood.

1545
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,643
We're not dating, exactly.

1546
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:12,811
That's my point!

1547
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:15,082
Hey, you're
shouting at me.

1548
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:20,253
It's been a really hard time for me, Roger.
I mean, I miss my family.

1549
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,229
I feel like

1550
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,691
all the hard work
I've done over the years,

1551
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,199
kicking the drugs,
being a dad,

1552
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,326
I feel like it's all
slipping away from me.

1553
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,893
It's not going away.

1554
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,371
It's transforming.
You're going through something, which means...

1555
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,375
I don't think you understand what
it's been like for me out here,

1556
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:38,708
how the life I'd hoped for...

1557
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:44,883
It's huge to finally embrace
the life you never planned on.

1558
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,817
I wanted to make
that record.

1559
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:53,793
We never would've survived at a
major label with those restrictions.

1560
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:54,850
How the fuck do you know?

1561
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,294
Because that's not
how the world works.

1562
01:28:56,364 --> 01:28:59,492
What could you possibly know
about how the world works?

1563
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:00,932
Listen, man,
I think you're playing out

1564
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,264
some old family
dynamic here...

1565
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,895
Apropos of what we
were saying before

1566
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:05,461
about what
people say about us?

1567
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,303
People feel you hold on
to petty resentments.

1568
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:09,605
You asked me what
people say about you.

1569
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,542
I don't want to know.
Yeah, well, you should know.

1570
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,170
People think you
play the victim.

1571
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:14,680
And I don't mean
this in a bad way,

1572
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,114
but you let people
feel sorry for you

1573
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,742
when you're really just
protecting your own narcissism.

1574
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:18,808
I don't want to know!

1575
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:21,821
Well, that's why I didn't want to
be in a fucking band with you!

1576
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:24,949
Because you won't
acknowledge your own shit.

1577
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:28,652
And you were
fucked up all the time!

1578
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,923
What do you want me to say, huh?
What do you want me to say?

1579
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,867
I had no idea that
would be our only offer.

1580
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,198
I didn't think that
I had the power to blow it.

1581
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:41,503
I thought that we were all
just giving our two cents.

1582
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,170
Fuck, I didn't know
I was gonna be

1583
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:46,873
the one to make
the band fall apart.

1584
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:50,384
You know, maybe, obviously,
I would do it differently now!

1585
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,851
Of course I know what it's like
to live a life I didn't plan on.

1586
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:00,155
What the fuck do you think I'm doing right now?

1587
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:11,399
Florence told me
you were in the hospital.

1588
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,438
I'd know,
I understand about those things.

1589
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,479
You know,
we could've talked about it,

1590
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:19,911
maybe made each
other feel better,

1591
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:23,417
but instead we never talk
about anything good.

1592
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:34,160
This is a small thing,

1593
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,822
and it's probably
boring for you,

1594
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,867
but it would've been nice if you'd
have made an effort to know Vic.

1595
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:40,992
Who's Vic?

1596
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,057
My son.

1597
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,299
Oh, Victor. I didn't
recognize the diminutive.

1598
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,691
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE) <i>Hi,
it's Florence. Leave a message.</i>

1599
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:12,960
Florence.

1600
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:16,332
Florence, I'm calling
to say I'm sorry

1601
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:18,668
you had to go through
what you're going through.

1602
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:22,698
And Mahler's fine.
He ate pizza.

1603
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:28,044
I'm leaving this in your voicemail,
but it's really a letter.

1604
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:31,175
I get so angry about
the world, you know?

1605
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,646
If I knew who
to write a letter to

1606
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,417
about all the stupidity
in the world, I'd do it.

1607
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,153
You're 25.
I was just 27.

1608
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:48,000
You're brave.
Young people are brave.

1609
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,768
When I was a kid,
I was a leader

1610
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,069
and most of the kids
always looked up to me.

1611
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:58,544
I thought I might go into space,
you know, as an astronaut.

1612
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,739
(CHUCKLES) I can't even
swim in the fucking pool.

1613
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,681
My brother's in Vietnam.

1614
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:06,242
We have the same parents.
I can't blame that.

1615
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,921
I really love Phillip,
but I'm not supposed to be on his bed.

1616
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:19,260
I love my parents.
I love Mahler.

1617
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,302
I miss my mom.

1618
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,099
I really like you.

1619
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:32,178
I just hate how embarrassing it all is.
I don't understand.

1620
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:33,811
What happened to me?

1621
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,348
Where does experience go?

1622
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:40,879
Remember Charlie Sheen standing
on his balcony in <i>Wall Street?</i>

1623
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,788
Did you see that movie?
Saying, "Who am I?"

1624
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,918
Phillip and I used to
make so much fun of it.

1625
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:49,087
I'm thinking, now,
it wasn't so stupid.

1626
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:54,830
Somebody once said to me,
"Hurt people hurt people."

1627
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,331
It's kind of trite,
but it stayed with me.

1628
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:03,901
Oh, man! That was you,
like, a few days ago.

1629
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,538
I used to have
a really good memory, too.

1630
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:10,175
Anyway, we do...
I do hurt people.

1631
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,281
Hurt people.

1632
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,788
I think Ivan and I broke up.

1633
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:29,031
Florence, I really like you.

1634
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:32,063
Love, Roger.

1635
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,007
(GIRLS CHATTERING)

1636
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:57,664
Assholes.

1637
01:33:57,999 --> 01:33:59,193
(GIRL LAUGHING)

1638
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:05,899
Dicks.

1639
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,209
MURIEL: I don't understand
why she did it.

1640
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,505
SARA: Good morning, sunshine.

1641
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,308
Holy shit!

1642
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:15,872
How you feeling, Sunny?

1643
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:17,575
What's "Sunny"?

1644
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,687
We decided that's
our name for you.

1645
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:22,951
I think I'm still drunk.

1646
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:33,129
Hey, they printed my
letter about Pakistan.

1647
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,599
SARA: Cool.

1648
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,435
"Roger Greenberg.
Hollywood, California."

1649
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:44,239
SARA: I mean,
I've got no problem giving some guy a blowjob,

1650
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:47,769
but she has taken
it to the extreme.

1651
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,011
MURIEL: Why do guys like to do that?
Come on you and spread it?

1652
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,553
They don't all like it.
(LAUGHS) They do.

1653
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,522
No, they don't.
You just like guys who do that.

1654
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,682
(LAUGHS) Fuck you!

1655
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:00,722
You're really good with him.
You have dogs?

1656
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,953
No, Florence showed me
how to do it.

1657
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,891
Did you start an affair
with Phillip's assistant?

1658
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,427
No.

1659
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:11,538
I'm jealous. (CHUCKLES)

1660
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,272
You should come to
Australia with us.

1661
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:18,743
Yeah?
There's a great Kinks song called <i>Australia.</i>

1662
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:22,772
Totally.
You should totally come.

1663
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,177
Maybe I will.

1664
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:26,445
Okay.

1665
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:30,183
But you better hurry.
We gotta leave in, like, five minutes.

1666
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,096
SARA: Fuck!
What are we gonna do about Mahler?

1667
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,095
Oh, fuck.

1668
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,234
Can I ask you guys a favor?

1669
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:53,780
Yeah. What's happening?
How you doing? I'm Roger, by the way.

1670
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:55,713
Marlon and Peggy.
Sorry it's such a mess.

1671
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:56,977
Yeah,
we're gonna go home.

1672
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,951
Can you take Mahler
until Wednesday?

1673
01:35:59,019 --> 01:36:00,008
Uh...

1674
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,553
Yeah, sure. We love Mahler.
Come here, baby.

1675
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:03,783
ROGER: Great.

1676
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:10,857
No, wait a second.

1677
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,924
You know,
run it by his nose.

1678
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:16,469
Okay.
No sweat.

1679
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:20,337
Thanks, man. And he takes prednisone,
which is a steroid,

1680
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:22,705
twice a day for the next three days.
I'll write this out.

1681
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,802
Also, there's an antibiotic and a blood thinner,

1682
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:26,107
but I'll write
it down for you.

1683
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,410
Let's go! We still have to get you a ticket.
ROGER: What time is it?

1684
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,882
Come on! It's fucking peaceful,
is what it is.

1685
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,044
SARA: I love it.
Did you see sharks last time? Oh, fuck!

1686
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,448
SARA: Okay.

1687
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,851
You know what really pisses me off,
is fucking Lily.

1688
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:43,590
Once again. I still can't get over that.
What a slut.

1689
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:45,798
Like, I'm thinking
about it now,

1690
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:47,731
and it's so much worse
than I remembered.

1691
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,531
Now that I feel like,
maybe I was drunk at the time.

1692
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,936
I've seen a great white,
and there are the most amazing wrecks.

1693
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:54,872
I literally cannot wait.

1694
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:56,603
I love that
you're doing this.

1695
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:57,974
Is this completely crazy?

1696
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:59,307
SARA: No!

1697
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,678
I mean, it's what
people do, right?

1698
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:03,717
You'll love Australia.

1699
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:05,081
For some people,
this is nothing.

1700
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:07,484
MURIEL: And who knows how much
longer the Reef's gonna be around?

1701
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:10,285
There's this starfish that's killing the marine life.

1702
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:11,517
Roger, are you certified?

1703
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:12,684
To what?

1704
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:13,988
Dive.

1705
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,789
No, I don't really swim.

1706
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:19,530
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1707
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,361
(COUGHING)

1708
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:26,036
MURIEL: You can go look at
whales while we dive.

1709
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:28,504
Sunny will look at whales.

1710
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,977
Okay, you know what?
You can cut out the Sunny business.

1711
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,206
(MURIEL COUGHING)

1712
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,912
SARA: Oh, my God,
look at this guy in these overalls and the clogs.

1713
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,246
I left my ChapStick.
Oh, my God.

1714
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,412
Are overalls back in now,
or is he crazy?

1715
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:43,456
No, I saw a bunch of
people in overalls...

1716
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,301
MURIEL: Hey,
will you check this out?

1717
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,701
SARA: What the fuck
is that?

1718
01:37:57,771 --> 01:37:58,829
That is so weird.

1719
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,136
I know, right? It's so itchy.
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1720
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:05,110
You know what?
I'm supposed to get someone from the hospital.

1721
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:06,976
No, no, no.
Hold it. Hey! Hey, hold it!

1722
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:08,912
Can you open my door?
No, you're our prisoner.

1723
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,383
Exactly. Come on,
open the fucking door, please.

1724
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:12,749
Okay, fine.
Come on.

1725
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,720
Roger, it's a rental.
Open it.

1726
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,415
Would you stop?
Sara, open the fucking door!

1727
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,458
I'm trying.
Stop pulling on it!

1728
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:20,724
You know, I can't go,
I can't afford it

1729
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:23,888
(STAMMERING) and I have to
pick up my friend.

1730
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,828
Have a good time,
all right?

1731
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:29,762
MURIEL: Bye!

1732
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:16,472
I've got to get insurance.
The anesthesia's so expensive.

1733
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,848
I'm such a baby
about pain.

1734
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,055
And I stayed overnight.

1735
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:27,085
I'm glad your brother's
coming back next week.

1736
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,152
I need to work more hours.

1737
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:38,532
Thanks.

1738
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:45,441
I really picked
my lip in my sleep,

1739
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,913
which was possibly about
finding a pet in the Canyons.

1740
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:51,511
Do you, uh,

1741
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,848
get <i>The New York Times?</i>

1742
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:56,082
No.

1743
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,857
It's good to get the paper.
I'll pick you up one.

1744
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,121
Okay.

1745
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,031
Did you get my message?

1746
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:07,897
I haven't checked yet.
What did you say?

1747
01:40:08,602 --> 01:40:09,591
Um...

1748
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:13,895
I reassessed the movie <i>Wall Street,</i>
among other things.

1749
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:16,667
I don't know it.

1750
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:24,546
I wasn't gonna give it to you 'cause I was pissed,
but you can open it.

1751
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,449
Happy birthday, again.

1752
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:28,746
Thanks.

1753
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:35,721
Now you have the set.
Not that they're a set.

1754
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:39,863
What about your niece?

1755
01:40:39,933 --> 01:40:42,595
Remember,
the sticks are too old.

1756
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:45,866
She's coming over this weekend.
I framed her picture.

1757
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:55,474
Do you have
a tape-measure?

1758
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,074
I think there's a ruler
in the desk drawer.

1759
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,218
Do you have a hammer?

1760
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:09,819
Maybe in there.

1761
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:11,922
Here?

1762
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,995
You want it on
this wall, here?

1763
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:17,762
Okay.

1764
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,236
Cool.

1765
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:27,074
Like a professional.

1766
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:29,806
Well, I am a professional.

1767
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,383
I mean, I build things.

1768
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:46,092
I know you know I was in a hospital.
I'm not hiding it.

1769
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:52,437
But it's not what
defines me, you know?

1770
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:55,608
I understand.
(HAMMERING)

1771
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,950
I want to
listen to my message.

1772
01:42:15,729 --> 01:42:19,495
I'd had some to drink.

1773
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:35,078
Gina.

1774
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:42,720
My mom.

1775
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:51,831
Okay. This is you.

1776
01:43:03,143 --> 01:43:05,634
