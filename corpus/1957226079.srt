1
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Hey, how you doing big guy?

2
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:46,499
We there yet. Why are we spending Halloween
in the middle of nowhere?

3
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,799
I never gonna get laid out here.

4
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,999
First, you're the only man
alive, who didn't get laid at Mardi.

5
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Gras. What makes Halloween so different.

6
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,300
He gets to wear a mask for qnet.

7
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,500
This trip isn't about getting late, it's
about Halloween.

8
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,600
We're going to take a little trip over to
the dark side a little bit.

9
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,400
It's not about getting late.

10
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,999
Everything is about getting late.

11
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Yeah, well with your skill in that
department, I can see why it's a concern.

12
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,500
I got something for you.

13
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,799
You remember these? Well the image of you two
having sex is truly a frightening thought I

14
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,320
got other things planned for tomorrow.

15
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,700
I don't know what you've got.
Planned money, but I'm intrigued.

16
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,099
I picked out a killer cost people started
wearing costumes on Halloween to hide the

17
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,499
people that was the one night of the year.

18
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,400
When spirits walk the earth,

19
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
Thank you. Michael Myers wasn't Halloween a
festival.

20
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,100
That was celebrated by The Druids.

21
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,900
It was called, Sammy Hagar's.

22
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,900
It is Life on Mars.

23
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,499
Don't listen to him. We said you've been
reading up on it.

24
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Now I saw a special on the screen.

25
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,899
Famous by the handiwork of the highwomen, the
what, you know, the serial killer never, got

26
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,599
caught Target Long motorists.

27
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,599
Run them off the road. He torture them until
they revealed their deepest, fears, guys,

28
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,300
just a warning.

29
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,200
This is not a conversation.

30
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,699
Most of the locals will appreciate two
uncles in particular.

31
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
I can't wait to meet.

32
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,699
Oh Michael.

33
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,800
Oh my God. Oh my God, it's so good to see
you.

34
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,899
Oh, my everyone.

35
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,740
This is my grandmother. You can call her
mom's.

36
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,699
We're sure John, oh, it's inside to the
right actually.

37
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,899
It's to the left, you know, the extra work.

38
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,000
Builds character.

39
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
These are my best friends Jennifer.

40
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,300
Market got bladder problems, Chris and this
is Peck.

41
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,199
Well, I'm glad to meet you all and I made up
the extra bedrooms, but I'm afraid a couple

42
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
of going to have to share.

43
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Do I have any volunteers?

44
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,400
Well, actually maybe a
pagan I could it mean if

45
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,299
Oh, I'm so happy to meet you.

46
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,300
My dear, how long have you known each other
for and a half years four and a half years

47
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,000
and no ring.

48
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,499
Well you stick with me.

49
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,700
Kid will Nick Michael tie that knot?

50
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Well, it's enough that talk.

51
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
Where's grandfather grandfather's hiding
inside?

52
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,500
Now I expected to more of your friends.

53
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Mention Trisha coming in the room.

54
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,800
Well, then, why don't you just go in and
wash up before bed?

55
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
I'll follow afterwards.

56
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,600
Come on. Where does it go?

57
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
Wonderful. Oh,

58
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,900
Oh, careful. That's that's hopefully there's
no such thing as women's work on this Farm.

59
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Heavy

60
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,199
And I've put you in your old room tank.

61
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,199
Seems like such a nice feeling.

62
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Like a, what is it?

63
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,700
A house girl is he around?

64
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah, let's see some, he's upstairs in his
place.

65
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,800
How is he, Michael?

66
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,700
He's really looking forward to seeing you.

67
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,400
All right. I'll go check on them.

68
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,300
Michael go up and see him.

69
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,600
He's expecting you. Aren't you forgetting
someone?

70
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,199
I should thank you greet. Your Ken me for
the hired.

71
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,500
Help course.

72
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
My grandfather.

73
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
What's so important about seeing Crow
tonight?

74
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,999
It's nothing. If young people are always
doing nothing is a claim to be there,

75
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,680
wouldn't be any need for parents would do.

76
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,999
What is it, boy, just
want to see him again.

77
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
It's all let sleeping, dogs lie.

78
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,100
Don't worry, Michael. I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

79
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,800
It's good to see Crow.

80
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:52,900
It's good to see you. So,

81
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
is it?

82
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
I really think it'll work.

83
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,999
Are you friends ready? Yeah, well, they're
here at the costumes.

84
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,600
So what have you told him?

85
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:33,300
That's it. If your friends are true and you
are prepared to face your fears, the ceremony

86
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,900
will cleanse you. And as leader of the
ceremony, you must wear this.

87
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
What is it? The death mask.

88
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,099
Looks like his, you must see through his
eyes, breathe through his nose, and speak

89
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,600
through his mouth, then you will enter the
dream state.

90
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,600
It is there. You must overcome your fear.

91
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,599
So, what's that? Ravens.

92
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,800
We, as long as I told him where is it?

93
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,900
The evils hell. Until we banish it forever
evil.

94
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,400
We're cool.

95
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,099
This thing part of Halloween extravaganza.

96
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,660
Well, it was supposed to be a surprise.

97
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,300
It's not a very nice surprise.

98
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,000
This is my old friend Crow.

99
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Ugly sucker. Morty was carved by my ancestors
many generations ago to help ward off the

100
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
advances of the white, man.

101
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,300
I guess it didn't work. It's been 60 years
working as a mannequin in the men's shop.

102
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Some believe is a vessel of evil spirits.

103
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Others think that he's just a dummy.

104
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,040
He's been around for as long as I can
remember.

105
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,800
Morty. It's part of Mike's family.

106
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,500
He has become the totem of his ancestors.

107
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,300
And his descendants to be.

108
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Morty is a name chosen by Mike's, father.

109
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,199
Morty crests.

110
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,800
It's getting old moldy.

111
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Hey, it's Mitch. It's about time.

112
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,200
All right. I love you.

113
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,200
Come on, Grandpa. Oh, you're here.

114
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,400
Okay Mike spell it spell work.

115
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,100
Hey you said you tell us what you have in
store for Halloween once everyone's here?

116
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Well everyone's here.

117
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,999
I for one would like to know why I
practically killed myself shopping for this

118
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
costume, okay? For tonight Halloween night,
we are going to perform an ancient ceremony.

119
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,200
One that crows people have been performing
for Generations as with the Monte right

120
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,100
Morty. Excuse me.

121
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh, now you just relax, you know, you
haven't had any fun since Reagan was governor

122
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,200
table will clear itself.

123
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,380
It doesn't sound like fun to me.

124
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He might be right. What are the details?

125
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,900
Okay, the most important part of the ceremony
involves the fear Circle, and that's us.

126
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,299
Cool. Yes, he see in the ancient tradition,
the participants of the ceremony must

127
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,000
masquerade is Our Own Worst fears.

128
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,599
That's why I asked each of you guys to, to
explore that side of your nature, find that

129
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,999
beer and create a costume that represents.

130
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,800
It always, sounds so exciting.

131
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,000
I know exactly the costume that I'm going to
wear and grandfather will come as a rodent.

132
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,699
And if all goes right at the end of the
ceremony, all our fears will be banished

133
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,400
forever banished forever, huh?

134
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,700
Well than I'm gonna be here,
I'm going to be a big pussy sit.

135
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll be a fat chick with saggy tits.

136
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,500
So Mike, how are you dressing
up his fear of commitment?

137
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,200
Hey, this is serious. You guys.

138
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,199
The only way this is going to work, is if we
pull something from the deepest darkest part

139
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:01,200
of our soul, Otherwise, we allow the true
fear, the opportunity to destroy us.

140
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,400
So you all brought your costumes?

141
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course.

142
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,500
Get everything is ready.

143
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,699
So tonight did that rings a bell wasn't
there, some sort of a serial killer around

144
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,660
here that got off on making people tell
their fears or something like that.

145
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,099
Grandfather. You're bleeding.

146
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,300
All right, I'm all right. Get away from me.

147
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Relax. It's just a bit of blood.

148
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't want it near me. Okay, we'll go in.

149
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,000
Guess we know what she's afraid of.

150
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,900
I guess you missed the, don't mention the
serial killers around the local speech.

151
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,900
Yeah, the only way this is going to work is
if you guys take this seriously,

152
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
He actually thinks it's going to work.

153
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,499
Trouble between mr. And mrs.

154
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,700
J crew. Sort of the tramping around.

155
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,300
No, nothing like that.

156
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,400
It's been four and a
half years, good years.

157
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,800
But, It still feels like we're dating.

158
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,300
That's not so bad. Not in the way you want.

159
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Are you looking for a gold ring?

160
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,900
It's not a bad start.

161
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,700
But you're not sure if he's the one.

162
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,400
And I guess that's it.

163
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,400
I'm not sure and
lately, it's getting worse.

164
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,800
My mother wants give me two
questions to ask myself about it.

165
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,000
I only wish I had listened to her before I
got married twice.

166
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
These are they Number one.

167
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,700
Do you think he has the same ideas you do
about children and a family?

168
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,400
Absolutely. Number two,

169
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,900
This one's important.

170
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:06,399
Imagine you're 60 years old and you're going
to Robo it out in the middle of the lake and

171
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,700
you're having a great time doing nothing.

172
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,900
Is he the one sitting next to you?

173
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Absolutely.

174
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,199
Okay. You know, no matter how long you been
going out, it's never too late to play hard

175
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,000
to get. I'm worried about him.

176
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,200
He's been really stressed lately and he's
been having dizzy spells.

177
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,800
And, I want to talk to him anyway.

178
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Thank you.

179
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,599
Mike. Mike, I'm sorry about that thing.

180
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,800
I said at breakfast.

181
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,500
I know that you've been really stressed
lately but I don't know why.

182
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
And if it's about me, then we should talk.

183
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
And if it isn't about me
than we should still talk,

184
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,200
At least I'm trying,
could you say something?

185
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,400
Sorry, that wasn't funny.

186
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,400
It wasn't meant to be. What the
hell were you doing in that mask?

187
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,500
Just wanted to see what it felt like.

188
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Michael, I need to know
what's bothering you.

189
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,900
Some really think there's some things you
don't know about me and my family.

190
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,900
Okay, you know, those dizzy spells I've
been telling you about the beginning, worse.

191
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Let me finish. They're more than just dizzy
spells.

192
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,000
I've been blacking out.

193
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Losing time.

194
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
My father had the same problem.

195
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,400
Do you think it cost your parents accident?

196
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,700
My parents didn't die in a car accident.

197
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,900
My father, murdered my mother and then he
hung himself, I saw the whole thing.

198
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,500
So I have years old. I know what you're
thinking.

199
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,699
Okay. Alcoholism runs in the family child.

200
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Abuse passes on from one generation to the
next.

201
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,899
Am I going to be my own father son?

202
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,399
Michael, I wasn't thinking that at all.

203
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
That I wasn't thinking anything of
the kind, we should have been, okay?

204
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,380
Because that's all I can think about.

205
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,700
Sorry Pig. I have these dreams.

206
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,100
These horrible dreams.

207
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm starting to lose control of them.

208
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,899
I just thought with this mask and you and
Crow and all my friends around me, I can face

209
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
it.

210
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,800
Hey. You can help me,

211
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,000
it killed my mother and
then he took his own life.

212
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,899
He's not going to have mine Michael.

213
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,799
You're scaring me. You don't know what
scared his pay until you wake up in the

214
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,400
middle of the night and seeing the things
that I've seen.

215
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh no. Oh no.

216
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Oh no. Which Peg?

217
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
She just came through. She went upstairs.

218
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,699
Sounds like a pig in my car.

219
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,200
Getting along. Pretty good.

220
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,900
Let's go. Listen. How was that?

221
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,600
Happy Halloween everybody.

222
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,100
One pellet tastes like shit.

223
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,300
Asshole. Stop me from drowning you.

224
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,500
Nothing. Just my brother being a moron.

225
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:55,300
Morty. You okay?

226
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Yeah,

227
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
We

228
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,620
Really started to lose it.

229
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,680
I actually thought that he was being
attacked by.

230
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,160
Hey, hey,

231
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,790
It was a joke, not a very
good one, but just a joke.

232
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,880
That piece of wood did not attack Chris.

233
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,090
Yeah, but I might find out
and make you feel better.

234
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,240
His arm is damaged.

235
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,800
I'm sorry, your stories won't fix it.

236
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,550
It was a joke. This is a spiritual symbol.

237
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,770
As I would never joke with your crucifix or
your holy mother should not joke with morning

238
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,510
person Morty Lay-off Chris.

239
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
The very poor

240
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,479
Joe Michael that I have worked in the barn,
but I will fix the ceremony will go on as

241
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
planned tonight.

242
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,230
Why are you always standing up for that
little shit?

243
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,660
Why is it always my fault?

244
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,630
Because you're the one
making the demands on the fans.

245
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,170
Like, how can you talk to me?

246
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,990
You can be such an asshole.

247
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,690
Don't start with me.

248
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,170
I was that a threat? Why don't we all just
relax?

249
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,730
It was a stupid prank.

250
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,230
I'm sorry. Okay. Out of this.

251
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,830
We do.

252
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,230
Hey, somebody help.

253
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,440
We could treat Pichichero shit.

254
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,930
Oh, and you said my gymnastics classes were
a waste.

255
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,530
Oh.

256
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,130
OK, you're visiting our curtain call.

257
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
We were great

258
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,190
And we didn't stick to the script.

259
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,750
Too close to home. A look
on Chris's face, it was worth it.

260
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I don't know,

261
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,250
It didn't feel right.

262
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,490
Please stop worrying, Mike.

263
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,450
You were nothing like your father.

264
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,980
And Chicken Crow applauding.

265
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,970
Listen, about the ceremony.

266
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,250
You having second thoughts?

267
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,300
Sometimes I wish you'd let me say what's on
my mind before you tell me what I'm thinking.

268
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:51,830
I'm not psychic, but I did find this in a
cemetery this morning.

269
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,880
This morning, I told Peg

270
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,470
That my father. Oh.

271
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,100
Yeah, I mean, she took it pretty well,
considering.

272
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
She's a good woman

273
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
And I know.

274
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,720
Your father was a good man.

275
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,960
Oh, no, my father, he was a good man and he
was a bad man.

276
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,840
His fears just got to be strong
and the good man was lost.

277
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,420
Michael, you have to do the ceremony.

278
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,380
You want fears before they grow to strong.

279
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,280
But this is just alcohol.

280
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,810
Yeah, well, this hunk of wood will become
your greatest fear.

281
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,550
And Yorkhill.

282
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Thanks, Colonel.

283
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:17,090
What are you afraid of? Arsenis.

284
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:39,739
Handing over sniffer of. I want you to stop
telling that boy those stories we were just

285
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,150
talking. He's got enough to worry about
without his father's ghost hanging over.

286
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,080
We all have ghosts, stop those stories or
I'll stop you myself.

287
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,400
Your grandfather lunch is ready.

288
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,470
OK.

289
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,650
Mike. Mike.

290
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,640
You can't stop. Mike.

291
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,440
Michael, coming for you.

292
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,550
Fear is coming for you.

293
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,080
Somebody. You can't be quiet.

294
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,300
You scared me.

295
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,400
Yes. Come on,

296
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,530
Come on, get back to your friends.

297
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,460
He beat you to the punch up.

298
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,580
What are you talking about? OK, fine, but
she's a cutie.

299
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,130
I wanted to go for a swim, but I can't seem
to get the pool here to work.

300
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,890
Look, I can't stand the water,

301
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:55,470
So you're not going to help me unless you
want to be a third wheel with your friends.

302
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,890
I was like,

303
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,390
He went up to the attic. Yeah, he's getting
ready for tonight.

304
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,630
She knew when it was up to.

305
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,740
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

306
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,900
Well, you know, you and
me, we need a little cutie shit.

307
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,850
You don't know where we're going.

308
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,250
Oh, yeah. Why wouldn't I?

309
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,090
OK, well, then you lead the way.

310
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,650
You're the man you're supposed to be better
with directions.

311
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,460
Well, I.

312
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,790
I think the house is that way.

313
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,430
Now. Get me out of here.

314
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,180
Ok, OK, I'm trying.

315
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,390
You know, you know, it's going
to it's going to get dark soon.

316
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,220
I don't want to be out here when it's dark.

317
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
You read the Bible,

318
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,970
You don't remember, I'm very religious.

319
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:29,780
Wow, that's a real turn on what a beautiful
girl that believes in God.

320
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Most guys, I'm unintimidating, not me.

321
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,640
I'm I'm religious myself.

322
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,830
I, I just like to keep it to myself.

323
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,240
Religion and politics should be private.

324
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,250
You're in politics, too.

325
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,840
Yeah.

326
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,090
On you. Well, yeah, of course.

327
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,720
You're a lot deeper than I thought.

328
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:06,319
Thanks. You know, most people think that I'm
just a pretty face, but if you take the time,

329
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,560
there's a lot more to discover.

330
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,930
I always did think you were the prettiest
girl in school.

331
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,430
Yeah.

332
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:23,779
But now that. Now that I'm seeing a new side
of you, I'm realizing that, you know, even

333
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
prettier than that.

334
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,300
What do you mean?

335
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:35,940
I mean I mean, your your beauty comes from
deep down your intelligence, your confidence

336
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,710
shines through. That's what makes you
beautiful.

337
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
What about Trish?

338
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,820
So it's a relationship of convenience.

339
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:54,880
Well, you're right about

340
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
One thing, which.

341
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,270
I am smarter than I.

342
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,300
I know.

343
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,220
You've got a twitch.

344
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,200
Cool, pretty good for the council's speak
softly, but carry a big stick.

345
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,220
Sorry to break up the party, but could
someone help me down?

346
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,440
How did you get up there?

347
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,760
And, you know, I got up here just to to.

348
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,890
Come on, look at you.

349
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,890
No way, what kind of a guy are you?

350
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,670
Come on, come up here.

351
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,700
Get me.

352
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,900
Can you climb a tree sitting on your mom's
waiting for you?

353
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,890
OK. Heitz.

354
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,580
I got dizzy driving.

355
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,426
We should probably
all get into our costumes.

356
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,730
It's getting late. It's been a real hoot.

357
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,170
OK.

358
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,830
I'm sorry.

359
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,270
Oh, no, it's all right.

360
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,320
Who is it? It's big.

361
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,670
Oh, Peggy didn't know you with your red.

362
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,960
No plans have always scared me.

363
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,360
Really? Are you an evil wish?

364
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,470
No, I'm darkness.

365
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,149
I'm scared of the dark.

366
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:44,300
I always have been traves grandfather crazy,
you know, all the night lights and such.

367
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,659
What can I help with? Well, I'm fine with
the cooking, but, you know, you could start

368
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,630
setting the table. All this talk about
fears has really made me jumpy.

369
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,530
Thank you, dear.

370
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:15,090
Butterfingers. OK, yes,

371
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,130
what are you wearing, claustrophobia?

372
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,250
It's very clever.

373
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,080
I've always felt safe in small places.

374
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,280
Oh, uh, Boza was my favorite growing up.

375
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,590
I, I guess we're even after you

376
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:42,540
your Jaws,

377
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,170
The movie, and I haven't been in the water
since.

378
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,240
Good on, brother.

379
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,920
Oh, fear of decisions.

380
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,220
He's never made one.

381
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,230
That's not true. I decided to wear this.

382
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,200
Oh, that must have been a real tough one.

383
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,650
That hurts coming from someone wearing a
cardboard box.

384
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,450
Is anyone hungry?

385
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,980
I'm starving.

386
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,360
Yeah, me too.

387
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:16,930
What is that? It's stupid and so thick a
mouse could trot on it.

388
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,960
What's in it? I'm not selling

389
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,879
Chicken beaks, spider hairs.

390
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,360
And it's a brew, not a stew.

391
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,766
We're all going under the evil spell.

392
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,809
That's right.

393
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,220
My pretty ones.

394
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:35,660
And I am going to shrink your heads and go
bobbing for them just like apple.

395
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,880
Whoo! Look at you, fake snakeskin.

396
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:49,480
I bought it at Billy Martin's mom for such,
you know, Cristoff H.O..

397
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,210
Oh, Blood-Red.

398
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,590
You like the dress. It must have cost a
fortune.

399
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,630
It was free and you have to kill, I put it
on my credit card.

400
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,630
Well, that's not free.

401
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,710
Lisa and I return it when we get home.

402
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:16,430
Gotcha. Uh, I'm not afraid of anything, so
I'll be going naked tonight.

403
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,820
Now, I'm afraid you've
already scared me half to death.

404
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,330
That's lame knowledge, that's cool.

405
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,410
Thank you.

406
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,060
Well, if you're going to play along, I'll
tell everybody for you.

407
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,700
He's a big baby when it comes to heights.

408
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,740
Let's set the table well, OK.

409
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,770
And of course,

410
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:20,240
He's hopping in his bedroom to being the
party pooper.

411
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,020
Well, I

412
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,159
Got something to get this party

413
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,010
O shots and you don't make maybe I should
have a drink.

414
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,570
That's the spirit.

415
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,600
Where's Mike,

416
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,100
Our fearless leader?

417
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,610
He must be waiting to make a grand entrance
forget.

418
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,020
Let's eat.

419
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,830
Oh, don't move, Mike.

420
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,250
Yeah, it's me.

421
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:50,340
It's about time. And turn on the lights and
see your costume.

422
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,999
Not yet. I have something to say, I know
I've been acting a little weird the last

423
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,190
couple of days is because I've been trying
to build up the courage for this moment.

424
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,500
But the moment has come.

425
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,530
Michael.

426
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,850
Oh, he's afraid of formalwear, right?

427
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,890
All right. I was afraid of commitment, but
I'm not anymore.

428
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,510
All that other stuff, that's not important.

429
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,260
You know, it's important.

430
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:52,350
Pick. Oh, oh, one of the fuses must have
blown.

431
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,710
Oh, I'm so scared of the dark.

432
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,430
Oh, wait a minute, there's got to be a
candle here someplace.

433
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,690
Oh, tragic timing.

434
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,650
Michael, Michael, you come downstairs with
me and help me change the fuse.

435
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:10,319
All right. And in the meantime, there are
some candles and lanterns in the upstairs

436
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,699
closet for you all.

437
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,830
And we'll be back in just a minute.

438
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,740
Come on, Michael. I'll be waiting for you.

439
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,600
I'm so excited for you.

440
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,560
I don't want anything to go wrong for your
big day.

441
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,030
That makes the box throw.

442
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Oh.

443
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,670
So how does he get here, Mike?

444
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,980
Michael, it's OK.

445
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:05,709
I took care of everything, just like I did
for your father, but this isn't where I left

446
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,710
the body.

447
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:34,940
All right. I used to post here.

448
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:39,680
Motive? I don't know.

449
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,716
So, look, consider her
out there maybe more.

450
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,100
He's making

451
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:44,350
Some moves. Isn't there some unfinished
business?

452
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,816
The reason we really came all the way up
here.

453
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,960
Well, hang on a sec. I mean,
Jen, we want to see this.

454
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,440
Isn't that her costume? Oh, probably didn't
fit in the bathroom.

455
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,589
Come on, Jen, finish up, get the perky ass
out here.

456
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:58,660
You hold the party.

457
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,460
Jennifer what's that?

458
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,490
That's a fucking

459
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:36,850
Stupid. But.

460
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,969
Mike, listen to

461
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,199
Yourself trying to convince us that the
spirit of your dead father's in a mannequin

462
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,590
trying to kill people, your father was a
serial killer.

463
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,019
Look, I needed you all up here to help me.

464
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,010
Help you what?

465
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:04,470
The whole idea of tonight's ceremony was to
put my father's spirit to rest.

466
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,860
I don't see any reason why we're sticking
around.

467
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,570
Let's get out of here. No, we have to
destroy Morty.

468
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,499
Mike, for once. I think he's got a point.

469
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,540
We should get out of here.

470
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,290
I understand what went wrong.

471
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,230
Krosa that with the townsman,
there would be nothing to fear.

472
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:21,260
And Mike Modie is a hunk of what you tell
anybody.

473
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,050
If we're looking for suspects, where's that
big Indian?

474
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,190
I haven't seen it for hours.

475
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,320
Crow didn't kill anyone.

476
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,140
How do you know, because Maudy got to him
first crows bodies in the cellar.

477
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,910
Well, it's not cool. And who is it

478
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:43,160
Not to be disrespectful, Mams, but the only
person not accounted for is your husband.

479
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:44,620
Oh, no.

480
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,630
There's one other guy
who could have done it.

481
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,299
And that's you, Mike. Oh, that's true.

482
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,130
Mike, you are with us.

483
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,790
Ok, believe me, OK, I
thought the same thing myself.

484
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,810
Look at me, there's no blood on me, huh?

485
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,450
How could I have done it? Blood washes off.

486
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,790
It was Morty who's ever responsible.

487
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,970
We have to leave now.

488
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,350
Let the police take care of it.

489
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,230
They can't help. She's right.

490
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,420
I'm leaving. Mike, we should get out of
here.

491
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,080
Is anybody listening to me?

492
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,690
We can't leave now. It'll only get worse.

493
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,000
I've heard enough and I'm packing up my
stuff.

494
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,730
Miss Maserati's in the garage.

495
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,160
Please, you guys, I need your help.

496
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,890
Sorry, we have to go now.

497
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,770
I'm not abandoning Mike.

498
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:56,470
I've got to deal with this.

499
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,380
Some friends you are, what happened to
sticking together?

500
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,830
This is just I want you to leave now.

501
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,460
Save yourselves.

502
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,650
There's been enough
harm done in this house.

503
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,240
There just can't be anymore.

504
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,290
Come on. Let's just get packed up and get
out of here.

505
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:16,350
Come on. I need my grandfather.

506
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,590
I can't leave my sister.

507
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,990
All right. We should stick together.

508
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,070
I'll come with you. Stay with Lisa.

509
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,220
OK. I know this must sound insane.

510
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Mike, listen,

511
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,970
You've got to trust me, OK?

512
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,410
I know what's happening here.

513
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:48,990
I trust you. Hey, it's going to be OK,

514
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,100
don't worry.

515
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,200
I know you're scared.

516
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I am, too.

517
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,630
It's like being this close to death that
just makes everything seem more alive.

518
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,349
What are we looking for? What do

519
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,350
We do when we find them?

520
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,510
Wait.

521
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,860
Yes, I do.

522
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:52,440
This is to tell us we've

523
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:57,280
Got to find more, going to
put it around his neck and

524
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,190
Stop. OK, that's what eases your mind and
lets go and find morning.

525
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,140
So, OK, you found Morti,

526
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,880
See, he's honeywood.

527
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:17,790
What happened?

528
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,460
He passed out, but it's OK now.

529
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,480
Matt.

530
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,510
Yeah, do you think?

531
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:40,350
I know. The thing you said about feeling
more alive when you're close to death.

532
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
Oh, me.

533
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:06,600
Here's the last place we saw lights went
out, just as I should finish what I started.

534
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:07,680
Not now,

535
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:09,280
Not under these circumstances.

536
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:18,130
Mike. Yes, forget about all of this,
everything that's happened today.

537
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:23,890
Now imagine that you're 60 and you're in a
boat in the middle of a lake.

538
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:28,130
Who's with you? But don't think, just
answer.

539
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:34,780
I don't know. My trusty dog, D'Aguilar.

540
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,170
Oh, and some

541
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,810
Old crap complaining about the cool.

542
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,070
My show starts.

543
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,150
That's my morning and finish this.

544
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,010
They to understand.

545
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,750
But everything.

546
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:09,290
I promise you, this is over, I do this
properly.

547
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,100
What the hell are you doing? We're getting
out of here.

548
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,810
You're coming with us. What about Mike?

549
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:38,850
Mike's a killer bag.

550
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:44,110
Come on, we got to wait for the others in
the car, not let them.

551
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,480
Oh, yeah.

552
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,380
Oh, yeah,

553
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,930
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh.

554
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,290
Let's get the fuck out of here.

555
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:23,330
Mike. Going down.

556
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:05,270
Like, oh, is he breathing?

557
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,000
God. Boki.

558
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,510
Lisa Anta.

559
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,600
Mike's up here. You better come, I'll be
right there.

560
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,570
I just did no.

561
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,440
Oh, I'm so sorry,

562
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:59,720
You, Michael, would never kill anyone.

563
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:22,840
I did not do this. I find warty, so you'll
believe me, I believe you, Michael.

564
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,080
You should.

565
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,750
Michael.

566
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:27,970
It is.

567
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:59,690
No grandfather has no guns.

568
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:07,130
Michael killed Peg, the others.

569
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,110
It's all my fault. No, you didn't.

570
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:19,840
Yes, I did. Trying to convince myself that
it's not it's not me, but it's true.

571
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,560
I'm just like my father,
Michael, enough was Morty Kro.

572
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:34,719
He's the one who locked me in this, but I
hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't

573
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,160
have believed it. I saw you going
out to the barn trying to find me.

574
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,609
I saw your feet. I wanted to help you.

575
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:46,520
But Morty came out of the barn and broke it
back inside me.

576
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:53,470
I followed what he was waiting for me with
Crow's dead body.

577
01:08:54,190 --> 01:09:02,190
Poor soul. It peg the others, Marty, we've
got to figure out a way to stop him

578
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:10,140
in this nightmare crusade, all in need of
these.

579
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,420
God have mercy on us all.

580
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,590
Mams refuses to come.

581
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,140
She says she won't leave her grandson.

582
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,860
We're going to get the hell out of here.
Now, wait, what about PECC?

583
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,600
Hold on. There she is, pick the gun.

584
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,540
Take your hand. Are you all right?

585
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:16,830
Yes, dear, but you're done.

586
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,370
Like, take off the fucking map.

587
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,650
I know how

588
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:37,130
You must feel, Michael. You still doubt
yourself.

589
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,230
I've been there to.

590
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,290
Given the fear.

591
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,370
You had to I had the urge, but I fought it
off.

592
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,600
Your father was a strong enough.

593
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,610
But I think you are.

594
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,210
No, I'm not.

595
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,640
I'm not strong enough to break this door
down by myself.

596
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,350
Can you help me? I'll get me up

597
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:27,970
This whole Balkan still charge
if he gets his legs under him.

598
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:32,940
Afraid of decisions, are we?

599
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:34,320
Well, here's a killer for you.

600
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,710
I'm going to rip out your heart or tear off
your head.

601
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,530
Fuck you, Marty. OK,
all of the above it is.

602
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:59,370
Scott. Not so fast, boys.

603
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:02,260
Fuck you. Is there any way to talk to.

604
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:10,320
Your father. Stephen, don't do this.

605
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:11,210
You stay out

606
01:12:11,211 --> 01:12:15,610
Of the staff. Sun.

607
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,250
It's all right, Michael, come my.

608
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:22,590
I'm your father.

609
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:27,930
You can do it.

610
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,450
Joe.

611
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,560
And you no.

612
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,970
Her.

613
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,320
What are you, one of Morty's creations

614
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,280
Like, it's me are me OK, Peg's dead.

615
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,180
No, it's me. Please believe me.

616
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,990
I promise. Now you're in the attic.

617
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,430
I looked everywhere for you, but not in the
attic.

618
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,270
Did you come any
closer? One of you is Morty.

619
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:20,550
How can I convince you I'm not Maudy?

620
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,500
Ok, you're 60,

621
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:33,240
You're in a rowboat in the middle of the
lake, who's with you?

622
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:38,300
I trusted Doug Yeller and some old
crab who's complaining about the cold.

623
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:14,870
Not that. Oh, Michael.

624
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,310
Everything's going to be OK.

625
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,910
I'm going to be at time.

626
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,790
Come on, come on, one.

627
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,090
Walk out of here.

628
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:10,710
Yeah. Decisions.

629
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,590
Fucking bastard.

630
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,150
Yeah.

631
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:58,390
Michael, you will become me, it's your
nature, I'm not your son, but your fear,

632
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,840
we're not my father.

633
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,009
Maybe it's time for another blackout or
maybe we should keep you awake this time.

634
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,430
Might be a little more terrifying.

635
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,230
I am not sure how.

636
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,530
Michael, you should be quiet.

637
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,870
You know what's going to happen.

638
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,310
He could put up.

639
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,320
It's going to blow things up.

640
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,340
No, because I can't do it,

641
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:42,400
Cut my arm off because I get

642
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,410
Done.

643
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:14,680
Chris. OK.

644
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,860
I can see the fear in your eyes.

645
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,440
Were you afraid of getting her Turbit's?

646
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:56,060
Where is it fire? I made a clear cut your
ass.

647
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,330
They kill them.

648
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:38,080
Where's that water

649
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,820
Go, let's go, let's go.

650
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,780
Is it over, it's over.

651
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:56,970
You know what, I'm not afraid of the water
anymore.

652
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:07,210
Please, let's get out of here.

653
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,200
Yeah, let's go. What are we gonna tell the
police?

654
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:13,180
Tell them the truth? Something attacked us.

655
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,300
You mean somebody who would believe the
truth?

656
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,670
What exactly is the truth?

657
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:20,560
I mean, was that really your father?

658
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,960
He didn't commit suicide, did he?

659
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:31,380
Yes. He did with the Indians say it's
suicide, never rest, it's over now, it's

660
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,590
finished.

661
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:55,670
I thought I knew this.

662
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:02,500
He did. You don't anymore.
