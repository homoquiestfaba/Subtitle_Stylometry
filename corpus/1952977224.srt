1
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,820
I remembered a joke.

2
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,540
It's funny.

3
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,039
Okay.

4
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,940
Seorg and his wife
were having sex one night,

5
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,621
when their young son
suddenly enters the room.

6
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:06,021
Hang on a sec.
Are we going in the right direction?

7
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,181
Olav!

8
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,381
What are we looking for?

9
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,661
Just keep going.

10
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,021
A little bit more or else
we will be flagged on the site.

11
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,863
Okay.
Continue the joke.

12
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:25,903
The boy gets scared and leaves
running from the room, crying.

13
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:29,303
The mother says, "Honey!
Now, what should we do? "

14
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,743
You know women...

15
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:34,343
The father says:
"Let me handle this".

16
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,623
Then he leaves
and goes to the child's bedroom

17
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,104
to say he was joking.

18
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:41,944
He opens the door and sees
the small bastard

19
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:45,744
is lying on top of his grandmother,
having sex with her!

20
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:49,504
Very animated too, rises and falls,
up and down.

21
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:51,864
Then he looks
for the father and says:

22
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,224
What's wrong, Dad?

23
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:55,664
You play with mine
so I play with her, right?

24
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:02,425
Stop!

25
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,705
Is it here?

26
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:16,627
It's right here.

27
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:41,308
Don't move!

28
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,229
Turn on the light.

29
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,949
Oh, my God!

30
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:17,955
Kate!

31
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,435
- Shit.
- Sorry, Kate.

32
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,675
These fellas said that you've been
expecting them?

33
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,596
- Of course, thanks, Hanks.
- Thanks.

34
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:30,796
Hey, uh...
you forgot, didn't you?

35
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,316
No, no, I just...

36
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,636
Yeah.

37
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:38,916
He just wanted to...
Actually, this is him.

38
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,716
I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.

39
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,437
Kate Lloyd.

40
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,917
Yes.
Do you know who I am?

41
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:48,757
I do.

42
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:51,637
Adam told me
a little bit about you as well.

43
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:54,957
He said you specialized
in vertebrate paleontology.

44
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:56,517
Primarily, yes.

45
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:59,677
And obviously you extracted specimens
from pack ice.

46
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:02,679
I've worked on several cold weather digs.

47
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,599
Good.

48
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,239
An old friend of mine,
a colleague of Oslo,

49
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,079
runs a geological research station
in Antarctica.

50
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,159
48 hours ago, his team found something

51
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,240
quite remarkable.

52
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
Really?

53
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,720
What'd they find?

54
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,920
We're flying down there tommorow evening
to examine the site.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
And I need a paleontologist.

56
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
Doctor, I'm sure you can understand that

57
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,160
I need to know a little bit about what
it is I'm being asked to dig up?

58
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
There is a structure.

59
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,441
A structure?

60
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,121
- Yes.
- In Antarctica?

61
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,281
And a specimen.

62
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,681
That's all I can tell you.

63
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,881
And I guess I don't have any time
to think about this.

64
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,881
No, I'm sorry. I need
your answer right now.

65
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,763
Well...

66
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,203
I'm in.

67
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,603
Great.

68
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,843
Adam will get you the details
of our departure.

69
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:11,243
- Right, I'll see you in the car.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

70
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,604
Adam.

71
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:18,524
What the hell is it?

72
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:20,964
You now officially know as much as I do.

73
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:24,284
But I'll tell you one thing, I
worked for that guy for three years

74
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:27,044
and I've never seen him this excited.

75
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,607
She US?

76
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,328
Look at this guy.

77
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:21,888
I mean, how is that even
humanly possible?

78
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,329
I was hoping maybe you could
help me with something?

79
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,289
I can't seem to get ahold of a newspaper
three weeks old

80
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,169
and I'm a man in desperate need
for certain information.

81
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,851
Carter, don't do this to
yourself, man.

82
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,371
And what information would that be?

83
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,051
I want to know how the
Cavaliers are going.

84
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,411
I don't follow football.

85
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,011
It's a basketball team.

86
00:08:58,691 --> 00:08:59,971
They play basketball.

87
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,891
Barely.
They're the Cavaliers, man.

88
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,812
- Sorry, I couldn't help you.
- Nah, that's all right.

89
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:11,332
Listen, just so you guys know,
whatever y'all are doing,

90
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:13,452
you might wanna wrap it up
in a couple of days.

91
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:14,852
Yeah, why's that?

92
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:18,412
There's a storm moving in.
A nasty one.

93
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:21,452
Good morning, Griggs.
Yeah, he's right.

94
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,853
And the last place
where you want to be

95
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,133
is cooped up with a dozen
Norwegian guys.

96
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:31,453
Trust me.

97
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,653
Base in sight of my 1 o'clock.

98
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:46,055
<i>This is H3 Sea King inbound to Thule.
Do you copy?</i>

99
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:50,535
<i>Hello, H3 Sea King.
Please, approach from the west.</i>

100
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,415
<i>Landing pad is cleared</i>

101
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,136
<i>Bravo, coming back.</i>

102
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,296
Good to go, Griggs.

103
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,976
- Dr. Halvorson?
- Yes?

104
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,777
- Welcome to Thule.
- Thank you.

105
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:23,097
Edvard asked you to go
to the site, right now.

106
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,057
Lars is going to drive you.

107
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,137
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.

108
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:31,057
<i>- Please go in the Spryte.
- Thanks.</i>

109
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:32,377
Hello, sir.

110
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,301
Watch your step.

111
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,023
Brighten.

112
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:37,943
Edvard!

113
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:42,183
- You got it.
- Sure, I did.

114
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,583
Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd.

115
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:51,104
- Columbia paleontology.
- Welcome.

116
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,024
Adam Finch,
my research assistant.

117
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,344
- Welcome.
- Hi.

118
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,944
This is Edvard, my good friend.

119
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:59,544
This is some of my team.
Karl and Juliette. Both geologists.

120
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:01,104
- Hi.
- Welcome.

121
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,504
Okay.

122
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:07,104
Let me show you why you flew
10,000 miles.

123
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:47,268
Holy shit!

124
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,988
We estimated this has been here
approximately 100,000 years.

125
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:55,508
We picked up a signal transmitting.

126
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:59,188
Some kind of distress call, perhaps.

127
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,388
Incredible.

128
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,349
We think the signal
was triggered

129
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,549
when the survivor
exited the craft.

130
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:11,469
Survivor?

131
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,711
My God.

132
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,432
How long will it take to get it out,
do you know, Kate?

133
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:00,993
Assuming you've the right equipment,
I'd say...

134
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,673
maybe half a day.

135
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,073
Good.

136
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:30,035
The ice, should I ask you how fragile
is it?

137
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:31,915
It's not in a fracture zone.

138
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:34,756
So there's very little risk of fissuring.

139
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:36,516
And the ice is quite dense.

140
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,116
So we think
we can get it out in one piece.

141
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,516
Good.

142
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:43,556
I mean, rough estimates about
6 by 12 feet, 3 and a half feet high.

143
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,916
- Probably some place right around...
- That's great...

144
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:49,556
Make sure that everyone stays off
the radio.

145
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:51,676
I do not want any information out.

146
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:54,757
And the crane... do we have
something appropriate for this?

147
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,597
Yes, it's already there.
It's all set up.

148
00:14:57,717 --> 00:14:58,997
I'm Peder, by the way.

149
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:00,877
- Peder.
- Nice to meet you.

150
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:04,637
So, you've gotten it all taken care of.
I don't think you really need me.

151
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,877
What about him?
He's secretly disinterested or...?

152
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:09,237
Oh, that's Lars.

153
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,999
He does not understand English,
but he works like a bear.

154
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,539
And, as you can see
from the scans,

155
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,740
the ship carved a 200 meter tunnel
into the ice.

156
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:21,879
So, let me get this right.
You crashed into a glacier...

157
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,279
And then without enough information

158
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,799
you leave the cozy confines of your ship?

159
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,760
Maybe he was hurt and wanted to find
someplace warm.

160
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,920
Well, I guess it didn't find it.

161
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:14,523
The first night is hard.

162
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:19,952
- Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you up.
- No, no, it's fine.

163
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:27,064
I'll never look at them the same again.

164
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,527
What do you mean for transport weight?

165
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:18,167
To cut it down to a portable weight,
we have to take it from here to here.

166
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:21,888
Start with 4 inches.

167
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:24,168
I never believed in this shit.

168
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,808
I always did.

169
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,088
- We're all set?
- Nearly there.

170
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,728
Good.

171
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:34,688
Good.

172
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:40,929
But before we do,
I'm going to take a tissue sample.

173
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:46,249
Do you really that's a good idea?

174
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:49,049
Yes, I do.

175
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,209
I mean the conditions
are so unpredictable

176
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,209
and we don't have the proper equipment.

177
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,929
Sterilization is an issue.

178
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,571
Edvard, what do you have in the way of
a small diameter drill?

179
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,811
Up to 30mm.

180
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,971
Very good.

181
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:06,651
I think somewhere around here.

182
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,691
Kate.
Just a second.

183
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:19,052
In the future, don't contradict me
in front of those people again.

184
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,772
- I just thought...
- You're not here to think.

185
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,412
You're here to get that thing
safe out of the ice.

186
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:27,972
I hope we understand each other.

187
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,940
So, have you ever tasted this before?

188
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,020
- No, I haven't.
- It tastes very bad.

189
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,540
Gentlemen.
Ladies.

190
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,181
After a short but thorough investigation

191
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,301
of our visitor,

192
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,061
I can say, unequivocally,

193
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:32,781
that I've never seen anything
on any cellular level,

194
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:38,141
like what we have
in that other room.

195
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,181
<i>Now, the impact of this find...</i>

196
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:44,263
<i>will be felt
for thousands of years.</i>

197
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,703
<i>From this point on,</i>

198
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:50,943
<i>the world as we know it
has forever been altered.</i>

199
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:57,263
You, my friends,
will all be immortalized,

200
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:00,464
as the people
who made this discovery.

201
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:08,984
Thank you.

202
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:17,184
Do you think they're going to pay a bonus
for bringing over an alien

203
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:19,025
instead of coal samples?

204
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,945
You've got anything better than
this cough syrup?

205
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,825
- Hey, Griggy.
- Yeah?

206
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:35,065
You want to go out
and get the cabinet stash?

207
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,667
Sure, no problem.

208
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,907
I'm on it.

209
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:04,468
Where did I put this bottle?

210
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,796
Jesus Ch...

211
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,236
Screw you, man.

212
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:56,316
Son of a...

213
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,599
It broke out!

214
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,039
What?

215
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,799
It ain't a damn joke, man!

216
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:34,119
The freaking thing's alive!

217
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,199
I was in the room, man,
looking at the ice

218
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,919
then the freaking thing jumped out!

219
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:05,441
We search
in groups of two and three.

220
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:08,921
The entire camp.
If you find it, pull out,

221
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:10,722
don't attempt anything
on your own.

222
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,390
And be careful...

223
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:14,101
we don't know what condition it's in.

224
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:07,335
Griggs, did you leave that open?

225
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,257
- I don't remember.
- Shit.

226
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:21,887
Hey, just be careful, man. That thing
jumped through the fucking roof.

227
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,129
Jesus Christ.

228
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:59,893
Help! Over here!

229
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:03,895
Help! Somebody! Over here!

230
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:08,895
- It attacked Henrik.
- Come on.

231
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:15,895
- Jesus!
- In there!

232
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:22,896
- God, somebody do something!
- Oh my God.

233
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:29,896
Shoot it! Shoot the fucker, man!

234
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,597
We got to burn that fucker, man! Burn it!

235
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,599
Throw it, throw it!

236
00:29:58,703 --> 00:29:59,803
His blood pressure's low.

237
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:09,503
Henrik and...
his small children.

238
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:16,704
Yes, it's horrible.
It's a horrible tragedy.

239
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,704
We're all shocked.
At what happened to Henrik.

240
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:26,804
But with due respect, we need to examine
the remains before it all disintegrates.

241
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,805
Hey, that was a man.
Not remains.

242
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:31,806
No, I know,
I'm talking about the creature.

243
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:36,005
And I'm sure we're all aware
of the importance of this discovery.

244
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:37,905
This may be the first
and only time...

245
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:40,606
mankind has been visited
by an alien lifeform.

246
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,877
And as scientists,
we're obliged to study it.

247
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:48,078
Didn't work out so well
the last time, did it?

248
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,907
I think you should destroy it.

249
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:53,196
Completely.

250
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:56,877
I think you've contributed
enough to this matter now.

251
00:30:57,378 --> 00:30:58,478
Oh, really?

252
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:02,696
Listen, your guy, Olav, back there,
he's in bad shape.

253
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:06,597
Now, we're gonna fly him back
to McMurdo at sun-up...

254
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,298
and take him
to the military hospital.

255
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:11,297
And what're you gonna tell them, hmm?

256
00:31:12,478 --> 00:31:16,828
I'm gonna tell them the truth, as crazy
as it sounds.

257
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,873
Kate?
Can you help here?

258
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:39,795
Come on.

259
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,515
Pull that side up.

260
00:33:10,716 --> 00:33:14,437
His face is encased in some type
of amniotic sac.

261
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:43,959
The tissue. Looks almost new.

262
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:48,839
What was it doing to him?

263
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:52,280
It appears that it was absorbing him.

264
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,160
Some type of digestion.

265
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,560
It's fascinating.

266
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,640
<i>It is fascinating.</i>

267
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,721
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

268
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:21,441
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

269
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:24,121
- Do you need something?
- No, no. I'm okay.

270
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,564
What is this?

271
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:56,364
Looks like a titanium plate.

272
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:00,044
Used to reinforce bones
and compound fractures.

273
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,004
Yeah, that's right.

274
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:04,485
Henrik broke his arm last year.

275
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,445
He had to go to Argentina
to get it set.

276
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:14,365
So if this was in his arm,
what's it doing out of him now?

277
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,365
That's a good question.

278
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:41,128
What are you doing?

279
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:44,008
Took a sample of Henrik's tissue.

280
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:47,248
I want to find out what this thing
was doing to him.

281
00:35:56,248 --> 00:35:58,609
I think you should take a look at this.

282
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:11,009
These cells aren't dead.

283
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:15,009
That's not possible.

284
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:22,691
Looks like the alien cells
are somehow

285
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:25,211
attacking Henrik's cells
and then they...

286
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:28,531
What is that? It looks like
they are transforming...

287
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:30,571
They're imitating his cells.

288
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:35,532
Okay, I don't know
if that's what I'm seeing, but...

289
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,452
They're imitating him.

290
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,013
It's going to be okay, Olav.

291
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:07,093
A doctor will see you in McMurdo.

292
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:11,013
Kate.

293
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,695
- Hey.
- Hi.

294
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:16,775
We're leaving.

295
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:20,325
Once the weather holds up,
we'll be back with help...

296
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,415
as soon as we can.

297
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,535
Okay.

298
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:27,055
Alright.

299
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,176
- Keep him warm.
- I will.

300
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,936
C'mon, let's go.

301
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,337
Sit down there.

302
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:52,257
There you go.

303
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,300
Ah, let's get the hell out of here.

304
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:42,065
Carter!
Carter, wait!

305
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,345
She's flagging us down.

306
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:58,787
- What's wrong?
- They shouldn't leave.

307
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:02,147
Carter.

308
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,227
Let's just get out of here, man.

309
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,107
Alright, fuck it, we're landing.

310
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:14,507
Shit.

311
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:16,188
Let's take her down.

312
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,588
Is there something wrong?

313
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,748
No, everything's fine.

314
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:32,108
Probably just forgot something.

315
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:35,669
We'll be in the air in no time, okay?

316
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:38,709
Don't worry.

317
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,709
Hang in there.

318
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:01,831
Something's wrong.

319
00:41:29,383 --> 00:41:32,713
Hailing McMurdo, or any ears on
the emergency channel.

320
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:35,033
Do you copy? Over.

321
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:39,293
I repeat, this is Thule Station.

322
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:42,793
They crashed here,
right behind this ridgeline.

323
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:47,115
It's impossible to reach them.

324
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:51,155
This doesn't make any sense.

325
00:41:51,435 --> 00:41:53,745
I mean, they have plenty
of visibility, right?

326
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:56,255
We're not going after them?
Shouldn't we try?

327
00:41:56,295 --> 00:41:58,395
We need a chopper
to even get close to them.

328
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:00,055
And there's refueling and hailing.

329
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:03,395
All this can't be a coincidence.

330
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:08,516
Radio's dead. It's fucking dead.

331
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:11,636
The incoming storm.

332
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:12,956
Fuck.

333
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:14,596
There's too much interference.

334
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:44,639
We have four missing persons.
We have no helicopter or radio.

335
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:48,759
You made a mistake
for bringing these people here.

336
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,239
More people may die.

337
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,039
But, Sander, we don't know
even if they are dead or not.

338
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,239
Colin, Lars, get your gear.

339
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,039
<i>We'll take a snowcat
to the next base.</i>

340
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,520
Lars, do it now.

341
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,320
I don't think that's a good idea.

342
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,200
And why is that?

343
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,560
Because no one can leave this camp...

344
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,760
until we know more about
what's going on here.

345
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,320
- I make decisions about this camp.
- I know, Edvard, but...

346
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,160
Why did you flag down that helicopter?

347
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,921
Because I thought it was in danger.

348
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:20,321
Why?

349
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:23,401
I took a sample of Henrik's blood...

350
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,081
and I saw that the alien cells
were still alive.

351
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:29,681
They were alive and they were copying
Henrik's cells.

352
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:32,201
Replicating them.

353
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,121
Adam saw it too.

354
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:39,123
Is that true?

355
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:43,203
I don't know.

356
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:45,523
I mean, I don't know what we saw.

357
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:47,603
I mean, we saw something.

358
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:50,123
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

359
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:57,124
That this thing can,
and probably has,

360
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,084
replicated a person.

361
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,884
- What?
- That can't be.

362
00:44:00,964 --> 00:44:02,564
- Who?
- This is insane.

363
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,604
Okay, Okay. Kate? Kate?
Okay! Kate.

364
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:08,564
This is not the time to be yelling fire.

365
00:44:08,964 --> 00:44:11,764
Let's stop, gather our thoughts,

366
00:44:11,884 --> 00:44:13,604
and discuss this in private.

367
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,845
We don't need
any private meeting, Doctor.

368
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:17,325
We all want the fucking information!

369
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:18,845
There's more.

370
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,565
What are those?

371
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:25,285
I think they are fillings
from someone's teeth.

372
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:27,805
I found them by a puddle of blood
in the shower.

373
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:29,165
Puddle of blood?

374
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:31,685
It can clone cells,
but not inorganic material.

375
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:34,847
It couldn't copy these, so
it spit them out.

376
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,807
We're wasting too much time already.
Lars?

377
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:38,708
Listen!

378
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:43,167
When I went back to check it,
someone had cleaned up the blood.

379
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:45,407
Someone had wiped it away.

380
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:48,687
Alright, so whatever it is...

381
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:52,048
It is still here.

382
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,088
I've heard enough.

383
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:02,288
Lars, Colin, get the gear.
Ten minutes.

384
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:05,268
Please, Edvard.

385
00:45:05,988 --> 00:45:06,968
You can't leave.

386
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:10,509
You can't leave!
You don't know what we're dealing with.

387
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:15,569
Well done.

388
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:26,631
Kate?

389
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:33,471
I don't know
if I should be speaking about this.

390
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:35,531
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.

391
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,651
Speaking about what?

392
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,691
You were saying...

393
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:42,711
about someone cleaning up the
blood from the shower.

394
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:44,872
And that someone here
may not be themselves.

395
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:45,973
Juliette, please...

396
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:48,932
What did you see?

397
00:45:50,092 --> 00:45:56,072
After the crash, I think... I saw
Colin coming from the showers.

398
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:57,792
He was holding something.

399
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:02,012
It could've been a towel, a rag,
something to clean up.

400
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:07,333
Kate, I can't say for sure, but
it's just that I s...

401
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:24,275
He's leaving with Edvard.

402
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:25,895
We can't let them go.

403
00:46:26,615 --> 00:46:27,955
We can't let any of them go.

404
00:46:29,595 --> 00:46:32,255
I know where they keep
the keys for the vehicles.

405
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,196
- Where are they?
- In that drawer.

406
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:45,176
- This one?
- Yes.

407
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:52,256
- How many am I looking for?
- Five.

408
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:55,436
Three and four.

409
00:46:57,056 --> 00:46:58,357
You said there were five?

410
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:35,760
Run!

411
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,500
Kate, what happened?

412
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,660
Karl. It got Karl.
It got... Karl.

413
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:11,981
Kate.

414
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:25,983
Burn it!

415
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,508
Enough, that's enough.

416
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,788
Burn in hell.

417
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:51,589
What the fuck's happening to us?

418
00:49:57,909 --> 00:49:59,749
It attacks its prey,

419
00:50:01,149 --> 00:50:03,191
copies it perfectly...

420
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:05,791
and then hides inside it.

421
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:08,151
Waiting.

422
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:12,671
Is it still among us?

423
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:17,471
It could be any of us.

424
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,072
We got to get out of here.

425
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,712
Yeah, right now.

426
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,352
And it could be getting
a vehicle with it.

427
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:32,552
You'll be alone.

428
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,592
Vulnerable.

429
00:50:36,512 --> 00:50:38,592
That's exactly what it wants.

430
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,673
Not to mention you'll be giving it
a way out of here.

431
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:45,193
A way to spread.

432
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:48,713
It's like a virus.

433
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,513
So what do we do with any virus?

434
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,433
Quarantine.

435
00:50:54,713 --> 00:50:58,235
We isolate it and then we kill it.

436
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:00,715
Yeah.

437
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,715
We have to rely on science.

438
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:07,235
Exposing our uncontaminated blood to the
cells of the creature

439
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,355
might create a reaction...
of some kind.

440
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,835
So we take blood samples from everybody.

441
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:15,395
Yeah, and we test each one of them.

442
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:18,316
Yes, Adam and I can do that.

443
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:21,276
Okay.

444
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:25,396
Lars and I'll disable the vehicles.

445
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:29,476
We have to trust in this plan.

446
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,277
It's our only chance
of making it through this.

447
00:51:51,077 --> 00:51:52,839
- Is that it?
- Yes.

448
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:55,599
- No more vehicles?
- Only these.

449
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,319
Okay.

450
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:07,879
What?

451
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:34,361
Grenades.

452
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,121
Is everything alright?

453
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:53,683
Yes, yes, everything's fine.

454
00:52:55,763 --> 00:52:57,043
Good.

455
00:52:58,763 --> 00:53:00,963
- Lars, you're okay?
- Yes.

456
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,923
Kate, we should go.

457
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:05,243
The storm is getting worse.

458
00:53:20,404 --> 00:53:21,844
Who is that?

459
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:35,445
Hurry up. They're coming.

460
00:53:48,887 --> 00:53:50,607
The Americans.

461
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:56,687
It is impossible for a human
to survive in that crash.

462
00:53:58,087 --> 00:54:01,848
We should burn them.
Right here, right now.

463
00:54:02,688 --> 00:54:04,848
- Let's finish them off!
- Peder?

464
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:07,328
It could be murder.

465
00:54:07,408 --> 00:54:10,528
- It could be survival, Kate.
- Yes, but we don't have to kill them.

466
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,928
Right? We can just lock them up...

467
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:15,248
until the Sander's test is ready.

468
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:17,408
Please.

469
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,409
Please.

470
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:14,513
So this is a good idea?

471
00:55:17,093 --> 00:55:18,453
Locking us up?

472
00:55:21,873 --> 00:55:23,333
You need our help.

473
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:43,135
Warn your scientists they can't handle
with what we saw in that chopper.

474
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:46,675
For all I know,
you could be one of those things.

475
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:51,055
It's pretty hard to believe
you both walked away from that crash.

476
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:54,196
- Yeah, I get that, I do, but...
- We're preparing a test.

477
00:55:56,556 --> 00:55:57,936
And then we figure out who's who.

478
00:55:59,696 --> 00:56:01,176
It's all I can offer you right now.

479
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
Damn!
There's a fire here!

480
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:07,881
Someone sabotaged it.
There's nothing left. Nothing.

481
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:09,581
Now there's no test.

482
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:11,921
How could this happen?

483
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:13,941
It was no accident.

484
00:57:15,061 --> 00:57:15,981
You.

485
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:18,581
You were in there with him.

486
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:20,581
You were the last one.

487
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:23,023
- How are you accusing me?
- Why not?

488
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:26,103
- He's got something to hide.
- What are you, an asshole?

489
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:28,523
I was the one working on the test.
I left for 2 minutes!

490
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:29,763
You just don't want us
to know the truth,

491
00:57:29,764 --> 00:57:31,064
- do ya?
- Bullshit!

492
00:57:31,153 --> 00:57:33,893
This is a goddamn fucking nightmare!

493
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:35,363
There might be another way.

494
00:57:39,663 --> 00:57:43,784
I think there might be...
another way to tell.

495
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:01,305
Peder, give me your flashlight.

496
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,625
Now tell Lars...
to open his mouth.

497
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:11,005
Tell him to open his mouth.

498
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:16,767
Open your mouth.

499
00:58:24,287 --> 00:58:25,927
That's good.

500
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:29,407
Lars has fillings.
So he's human.

501
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:31,607
It can't imitate
inorganic material.

502
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:34,187
See?

503
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:36,948
Yes.

504
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:47,908
Good.

505
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:50,428
Good.

506
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,628
Open.

507
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:55,629
Come on!

508
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:58,269
You're next!

509
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:00,069
Open your mouth!

510
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:08,669
Okay.

511
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:11,829
Good.

512
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:17,711
Right now, it's at least something.

513
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:20,511
A way to eliminate
some of us.

514
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,871
So I'm gonna get killed because
I floss?

515
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:24,871
Nobody's getting killed.

516
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,471
Kate?

517
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,351
Kate, come on.

518
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:31,112
Kate.

519
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:34,352
Just do it.

520
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:36,212
Kate.

521
00:59:39,272 --> 00:59:40,412
Open.

522
00:59:56,353 --> 00:59:58,013
Just go stand over there.

523
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:13,775
You know as well as I do,
there are too many variables.

524
01:00:16,355 --> 01:00:17,595
Open your mouth.

525
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,156
Open your mouth!

526
01:00:26,216 --> 01:00:27,276
Theyre porcelain.

527
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:33,196
Go stand with Adam.

528
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:39,576
Anyone else with porcelain fillings?

529
01:00:40,376 --> 01:00:41,656
Or clean teeth?

530
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:46,697
It's bloody absurd.

531
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,199
This is wrong.

532
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,180
Jonas, you and Lars go out.

533
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,660
Get Carter and Jameson,
bring them in here, we'll check them too.

534
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,081
But why don't we just leave them
where they are? They can't do anything.

535
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:42,141
We need to know.

536
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:44,461
- What?
- She wants us to find the Americans.

537
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:45,901
Let's do it, then.

538
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:48,521
Come on!

539
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:10,343
She is smart.

540
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:16,164
Yeah.

541
01:02:17,784 --> 01:02:19,404
She is in control now.

542
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:07,407
Shit, they've gone.

543
01:03:08,507 --> 01:03:09,828
They escaped.

544
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:11,848
Lars.

545
01:03:12,928 --> 01:03:14,708
Let's go back inside.

546
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:18,608
No.
We have to find them.

547
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:22,288
Lars, be careful.
They are not human!

548
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:24,888
Lars!

549
01:03:25,688 --> 01:03:26,828
Lars!

550
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:29,029
Lars!

551
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,330
Lars!

552
01:03:31,169 --> 01:03:32,969
Lars Wait.

553
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:34,369
Lars.

554
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,149
Peder.

555
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:42,049
Stay calm!

556
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:46,871
The threat isn't here.

557
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,611
It's out there.

558
01:03:49,271 --> 01:03:51,431
The Americans are the real enemy.

559
01:03:52,631 --> 01:03:54,211
He's right, Peder.

560
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,771
Whatever they're saying right now,
it doesn't matter.

561
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:59,791
You can't trust them.

562
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,132
Watch them.

563
01:04:09,832 --> 01:04:10,892
Kate!

564
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:12,492
Come on!

565
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:17,672
Come on!

566
01:04:18,492 --> 01:04:19,853
Where are they?

567
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:22,657
- Where's the rest?
- They attacked them.

568
01:04:22,737 --> 01:04:24,139
- Who?
- They got Lars!

569
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:26,781
- Peder!
- They took Lars!

570
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,383
- What happened?
- Peder, keep them back.

571
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:30,345
- We have to help him.
- Stay on them, Peder.

572
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:32,507
- What happened?
- Peder, they took Lars.

573
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:35,550
- The enemy is out there.
- We don't know if we can trust them!

574
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,752
Peder, don't listen to them.

575
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,255
Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder!

576
01:04:45,403 --> 01:04:46,524
They're inside.

577
01:04:58,635 --> 01:04:59,938
Where is Lars?

578
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:01,139
We haven't got Lars.

579
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,022
- Calm down!
- Where is Lars?

580
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:04,563
I said calm down!

581
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:07,086
- Where the fuck is Lars?
- Drop it!

582
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:11,670
- Somebody tell him.
- Peder, don't listen to them.

583
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:14,513
- Put it down!
- They killed Lars!

584
01:05:14,853 --> 01:05:18,358
Lars is killed.
Burn them! Burn them!

585
01:05:32,032 --> 01:05:34,014
Peder? Peder?

586
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,021
Okay!

587
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:41,765
I just wanna check my friend, okay?

588
01:05:42,865 --> 01:05:43,926
It's okay.

589
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:46,549
He was gonna fire.

590
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:00,624
It's gonna catch fire!
It will explode!

591
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:01,726
Come on! Let's go!

592
01:06:21,826 --> 01:06:22,707
Edvard?

593
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,451
Edvard?

594
01:06:35,522 --> 01:06:37,244
- Pick him up.
- Okay.

595
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:42,148
You.

596
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,131
Yeah, you. Help him!

597
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,282
Alright, show yourselves!

598
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:57,326
Right fucking now!

599
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:05,013
Everybody in the rec room.

600
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,882
Pick him up, come on.

601
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,249
Sit down.

602
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:30,089
Not all of us are human.

603
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:33,469
Just put him over there
on the couch.

604
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:50,966
Help! Help me!

605
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:52,767
- My God!
- Get it off him!

606
01:07:54,205 --> 01:07:56,145
What the fuck is this shit, man?

607
01:08:06,384 --> 01:08:07,784
Carter, Carter!

608
01:08:07,905 --> 01:08:09,084
Carter, burn it, man!

609
01:08:10,323 --> 01:08:12,283
There's something wrong with it!
Hold on!

610
01:08:12,364 --> 01:08:14,463
Goddamn it, Carter, burn it!

611
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:21,001
Look out!
Fuck!

612
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:22,864
Adam!

613
01:08:29,842 --> 01:08:31,702
- Shit!
- Carter, take it!

614
01:08:34,182 --> 01:08:35,201
Carter!

615
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:36,741
There's something wrong
with the pressure.

616
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:38,640
Put some air in the pipe.

617
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:42,040
Watch out!

618
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,801
Carter!

619
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:57,218
We gotta get the air up.

620
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:04,919
No.

621
01:09:19,456 --> 01:09:20,356
No.

622
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,097
No.

623
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:23,776
God!

624
01:09:24,677 --> 01:09:25,877
No, God!

625
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:28,176
Carter!

626
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:31,815
No! No!

627
01:10:36,709 --> 01:10:38,669
I'm with you, buddy.

628
01:11:24,263 --> 01:11:25,124
Carter.

629
01:11:30,543 --> 01:11:31,562
You're okay?

630
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:33,702
Yeah.

631
01:11:37,302 --> 01:11:38,381
And you?

632
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,902
Not yet, no.

633
01:11:41,481 --> 01:11:44,320
We find it and then we kill it.

634
01:12:52,154 --> 01:12:53,712
I think that was Sander.

635
01:12:55,052 --> 01:12:56,012
Yeah.

636
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:18,111
- Shit!
- Watch out! God!

637
01:13:20,151 --> 01:13:22,091
Kate, do you see it?

638
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:23,330
Where'd it go?

639
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:26,030
There!

640
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,449
Get back!

641
01:13:38,469 --> 01:13:39,929
Don't.
Don't touch it.

642
01:13:57,987 --> 01:13:59,067
You hear that?

643
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:00,767
Yeah.

644
01:17:38,984 --> 01:17:39,922
Kate!

645
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,340
- Sander.
- Wait.

646
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:06,020
So what?

647
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,659
He'll freeze out there.

648
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:10,020
And if he doesn't?

649
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:11,838
If it makes it out of here...

650
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:15,057
millions of people could die.

651
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:17,418
- It's got nowhere to go.
- Yes, it does.

652
01:18:28,718 --> 01:18:31,041
Alright.

653
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:14,052
What?

654
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:19,894
What happened to Lars?

655
01:19:21,413 --> 01:19:23,016
We didn't kill him.

656
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:18,514
Come on.

657
01:20:45,922 --> 01:20:47,165
Run, run!

658
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:05,251
Kate!

659
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:07,929
Kate!

660
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,371
Kate!

661
01:22:33,718 --> 01:22:34,599
Kate?

662
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,197
Kate?

663
01:26:45,225 --> 01:26:46,265
Kate!

664
01:27:52,466 --> 01:27:53,667
So what we do now?

665
01:27:59,429 --> 01:28:01,008
There's a Russian station...

666
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:03,451
about 50 miles from here.

667
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,111
Should have enough gas.

668
01:28:14,814 --> 01:28:16,656
We're gonna make it back, okay?

669
01:28:20,055 --> 01:28:20,976
Okay.

670
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,121
Let's go.

671
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:44,843
I'm ganna put this in the back.

672
01:29:01,947 --> 01:29:03,629
You know how I knew
you weren't human...

673
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:07,010
when you showed up back at base?

674
01:29:09,370 --> 01:29:10,291
No.

675
01:29:13,453 --> 01:29:14,654
Your earring.

676
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:24,797
It was on your other ear.

677
01:29:36,201 --> 01:29:37,239
Kate?

678
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,842
Kate, what're you doing?

679
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,263
Let's talk about it.

680
01:29:43,323 --> 01:29:44,263
Talk to me.

681
01:29:44,743 --> 01:29:45,663
Kate?

682
01:29:46,105 --> 01:29:46,984
Kate!

683
01:29:48,364 --> 01:29:49,246
Kate!

684
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:53,746
No!...

685
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,491
Oh my God.

686
01:32:18,025 --> 01:32:22,421
Hello?
Hello, can anybody hear me?

687
01:32:24,024 --> 01:32:25,023
Hello?

688
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:28,525
Edvard?

689
01:32:29,524 --> 01:32:30,525
Edvard?

690
01:32:34,701 --> 01:32:36,027
Edvard?

691
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:39,328
Edvard?

692
01:32:40,705 --> 01:32:42,405
Lars, it's me.

693
01:32:50,405 --> 01:32:51,505
Hello, Lars!

694
01:33:00,106 --> 01:33:03,634
Lars? Lars, it's Matias.
It's Matias!

695
01:33:03,904 --> 01:33:05,526
- Open your mouth.
- What?

696
01:33:05,835 --> 01:33:12,932
- Do what I say, now!
- It's Matias. Lars, it's me, Matias.

697
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:28,001
That's no dog.
Start the helicopter, now!

698
01:33:35,325 --> 01:33:38,105
Get it up, get it up! Now!
Come on!
