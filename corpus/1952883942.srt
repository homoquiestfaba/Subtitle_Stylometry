00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,899
Susan PAKLENI
PLAN

2
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,654
Susan.

3
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,379
Are you awake?

4
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,970
Are you awake? Are you ready?

5
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,733
Descend between the handset and you
call immediately.

6
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,775
Sam? I know how many hours.

7
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,936
Because I want you to come here.

8
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,575
Wait ...

9
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,259
Wait, wait.

10
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,888
Where are you going?

11
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,848
Just a second.

12
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,333
Susan!

13
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,531
I think it can not start.

14
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,736
I really think?

15
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,009
I do not know what you zamišIjaš who you are!

16
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,619
I own this damn
parking!

17
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,259
You should sell
cars!

18
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,730
You eat my cakes and my drink
Coffee,

19
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,329
and have not sold any
car, you understand?

20
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,259
You need to sell the damned
cars, for heaven's sake!

21
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,371
I hate to get involved and work
satisfaction,

22
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,571
but in your case I will make
exception.

23
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,213
You're fired!

24
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,893
Damn shit ...

25
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,570
I would say that you did not win
raise.

26
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,378
I was fired.

27
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,098
What do we do now?

28
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,614
I do not know.

29
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,936
You are the one who has a genius
ideas.

30
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,888
Do you remember that guy from
Insurance?

31
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,500
He could have sent to us
constipation, Bile, but did not.

32
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,815
Called me.

33
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,609
And is called?

34
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,417
Type of insurance and the call?

35
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,530
That's it.

36
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,970
Why? Probably not changed
mišIjenje?

37
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,249
It is not.

38
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,690
He said he had proposed to us.

39
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,889
Proposal?

40
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,579
Some sort of business offer.

41
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,497
Yes?

42
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,459
Thus, he said.

43
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,136
This guy can easily overlook us,
you know.

44
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,495
I think not.

45
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,650
Why?

46
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,538
He had us in hand,

47
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,698
stretched, as the deer between
lighted headlights.

48
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,849
What bre as a means to spread
deer between headlights?

49
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,568
No, Steve.

50
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,979
I said "crucify" the comma,
then as a deer between the headlights.

51
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,852
What are you talking about bre?

52
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,051
I'm just saying that this guy could
to put us in jail,

53
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,409
and it is not.

54
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,733
I think we owe him so much that
it at least listen.

55
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,737
Business offer?

56
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,130
Betty will peel off when you hear
I lost my job.

57
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,933
Ok, let's ask him.

58
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,211
Would you like coffee? Dessert?

59
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,768
Just coffee, please.

60
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,779
I will espresso.

61
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,979
Cappuccino.

62
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,019
We only have coffee.

63
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,175
Can and coffee.

64
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,059
Do not have a cappuccino?
- No, sir. Just coffee.

65
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,649
All right. I will also coffee.

66
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,535
I would like to see a menu
desserts, please.

67
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,855
I'll bring you coffee.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,536
Ok.

69
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:02,330
I am interested in exactly where we
to procure these weapons?

70
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,775
What are you talking about? This is Los
Angeles, Steve.

71
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,016
Yet you can just to get into
shop and buy it.

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,136
Can.

73
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,614
Yes, you can.

74
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,652
But you should register.

75
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,970
And there is a waiting period before
than you give it.

76
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,414
My brother in law has a weapon.

77
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,214
What weapon?

78
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,939
Revolvers, pistols.

79
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,056
What guns?

80
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,018
I do not know. You'll learn.

81
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,573
Thank you.

82
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,616
It does not matter. I'll take just a coffee.

83
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,770
See? We do not know what
We need guns.

84
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,890
We shall see.

We will be notified before
can begin.

87
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,417
Armed and dangerous.

88
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,059
See?

89
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,774
I told you that we will be good
in this.

90
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,620
You were right.

91
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,138
Give us your bag!

92
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,257
Huh!

93
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,893
Just do it, man!

94
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,374
Who are you guys?

95
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,172
Take the fucking bag.

96
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,929
It's not dead!

97
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,773
Well, now he's dead.

98
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,254
Let's go!

99
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,133
How did it go?

100
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,052
We wanted to see if we

studios in Los Angeles

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,338
this is the news at half past seven.

103
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,058
The miracle is that it does not happen more often in
our roads,

104
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,332
and when it happens it is bad. This is
worst.

105
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,411
Good morning, this is the UPN 13
news.

106
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,417
I'm Tony Little.

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,817
Thank you for joining us
today.

108
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,850
Shit.

109
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,613
That part is good, Bill.

110
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,492
As we have mentioned is a good
thing.

111
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,019
Something to drink?

112
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,938
Do you have red wine?

113
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,454
Yes, I think.

114
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,772
Nothing for me. Thank you.

115
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,651
It was not bad.

116
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,531
What?

117
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,139
We just shot and killed
man.

118
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,210
Ah, yes.

119
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,978
Yes, you're right. It was not so
bad.

120
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,489
Now that I've killed a man,

121
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,732
understand more.

122
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,334
Understand more about what?

123
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,258
The news,

124
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,371
about events in the world ...

125
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,973
People keep killing people.

126
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:57,298
Yes ... When you discover how
easy to kill someone,

127
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,011
you can go out and repeat it.

128
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,693
It explains the history!

129
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,409
Just that.

130
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,090
Thank you.

131
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,256
So?

132
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,409
Tell me what it was.

133
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,532
We grabbed his briefcase and
shot him three times.

134
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,414
I wanted bastard is dead, but three
times?

135
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,659
Too much?

136
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,375
Hello?

137
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,129

138
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,299
What is it?

139
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,529
Are you all right?

140
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,572
Paul is alive, stupid morons!

141
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,135
Sorry.

142
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,816
Hello?

143
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,410
Hello?

144
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,009

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,057
Can I help you?

Do you have a patient who is
Paul Holland called?

147
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,339
Yes, we have.

148
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,489
Where is it?

149
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,812
Unfortunately, in intensive care
was. Visits are not allowed.

150
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,849
Oki doki. Can I talk to

The first serious exercise equipment for home
workout designed for women.

159
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,849
Now you can take the form not to
cancel.

161
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,409
Last night.

When can I see Paul?

168
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,337
What happened? Why talk
with a police officer?

169
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,413
Mr. Holland was shot and seriously
was wounded.

170
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,059
Do you know someone who has been in
quarrel

171
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,649
or who had a problem with Mr.
Holland?

172
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,290
I just met him. Recently
We started the connection,

173
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,054
I do not know much about him, but ..

174
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,818

Mr. Holland called the police
with your phone in the car.

184
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,453
They found him in a car with three
wounds inflicted by firearms.

185
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,777
We know only so much.

186

I will.

187
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,056
Hello.

188
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,614
Who called?

189
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,411
How do I know?

190
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,609
Pick up!

191
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,572
Who called?
- I do not know.

192
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,611
Pick up the damn phone!

193
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,296
Hello?

194
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,496
Susan?

195
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,291
Betty?

196
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,774
Paul will be fine.
- Shit!

197
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,251
What is it?

198
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,131
Paul will be fine.

199
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,738
Shit!

200
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,213
Fuck!

201
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,170
Damn!

202
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,415
Betty?
- Yes?

203
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,450
Where are you?

204
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,133
Now I am in my apartment.

205
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,892
Give it to me.

206
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,571
Betty!

207
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,093
Who is it?
- Sem.

208
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,411
Jesus, seed! How upucaš type
three times at close range

209
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,894
and do not kill him?

210
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,136
I do not know, you'll have to ask Bill and
Steve when you see them.

211
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,977
What should we ask?

212
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,215
Betty, listen to me!

213
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,888
Call us as soon as you find out that Paul
came up with the intensive

214
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,772
as soon as they receive care and room number. Ok?

215
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,459
What should we ask, seed?

216
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,934
Betty?
- Yes?

217
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,859
An attempt to became friends with
as many people of importance.

218
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,209
As a doctor?

219
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,411
Read the doctor's Equality
doctor and come together with him.

220
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,451
See if you can shift the
Half a separate room.

221
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,897
Ok. Can you invite to shop
tell them that I was sick?

222
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,700
Yes, yes. I'll call and I'll tell you in
hospital with a sick friend.

223
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,329
You are my only real sick
friend, Susan.

224
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,450
Call us when you know the number of
rooms.

225
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,979
Give it to me!

226
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,169
Hi, sweetie, I am.

227
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,773
Hi, sugar.

228
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,050
I love you.

229
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,849
I know. Hello.

230
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,170
Betty wondered how you were able
so that thing fucks!

231
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,974
It is not fair.
- He's right, Seeds.

232
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,376
Maybe wearing a bulletproof vest or so
something.

233
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,535
Please!

234
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,574
Who is it?

235
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,014
How did I know?

236
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,613
We can not be here.

237
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,737
Poles go to the office, there
has a large closet.

238
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,293
You want to hide in the closet?

239
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,178
Not that way! This way!

240
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,969
You enter.

241
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,855
Sorry ... I telephoned.

242
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,937
Mrs. Holland, I am a detective
Scott.

243
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,539
We talked by phone
this morning.

244
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,059
I'm sorry, I do not remember.

245
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,573
It's about your ex-husband,
Mr. Holland.

246
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,419
Of course! How stupid I am,
course. Sorry.

247
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,575
This is a patrolman Francis.

248
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,974
Hello.
- Mrs..

249
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,215
Certainly I think that ...

250
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,569
Not at all.

251
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,968
Can we then go?

252
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,655
Yes, of course.

253
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,414
Would you like something to drink?

254
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,569
No, thanks.

255
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,177
Are you sure you do not want anything?
- No, thank you, Mrs..

256
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,615
I think my foot was numb.

257
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,889
Shut up!

258
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,250
I was curious why you did not come to
visit her husband in hospital

259
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,529
Mrs. Holland.

260
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,253
Ex-husband.

261
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,132
We are not in the best of relationships.

262
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,416
Divorced you ...?
- Three years.

263
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,296
Do you own a gun, Mrs.
Holland?

264
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,979
No.

265
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,853
It appears that Mr. Holland was shot
from two different guns.

266
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,539
It is quite unusual.

267
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,458
As the half?
- Recover.

268
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,128
It's amazing what you are
doctors can.

269
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,893
Stunning.

270
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,579
You were wounded, right,
Ted?

271
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,809
Just once.

272
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,248
Where were you wounded?

273
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,098
In Vestvardu, sir.

274
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,654
I have difficulty breathing.

275
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,373
Shut up!

276
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,053
I have to prdne.

277
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,659
If prdneš, I swear to God,
I will kill you.

278
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,256
Do you know Elizabeth Johnson?

279
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,612
No, I do not think so.

280
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,697
Friends call her Betty.

281
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,535
No. I do not know it.

282
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,049
That's all for now.

283
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,889
What was that?

284
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,493
What?

285
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,298
Asshole.
- You bastard!

286
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,338
Stop. Shut up! Shut up!

287
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,252
Sorry.
- Yes?

288
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,572
Are you a doctor Stilman?

289
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,572
Yes. How can I help you?

290
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,135
Are you Dr. Paul
Holanda?

291
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,659
One.

292
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,453
Superiška.

293
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,410
I hope to be half good
but ...

294
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,458
You must understand that we
discussed for years.

295
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,769
Three years.

296
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,978
Yes. Three years.

297
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,256
Thanks again.

298
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,773
What were you doing here, dammit!

299
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,649
Wait a minute.

300
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,858
Lord ...

301
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,255
Out of nervousness I get gas.

302
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,890
I trained hundreds of women and I know
that the landscape hips and thighs can

303
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,610
be a problem, but let us look at
it as a problem.

304
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,617
Let's call it a challenge.

305
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,296
But ... Now we have to be
back to work.

306
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,497
When you go to lunch?

307
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,215
For an hour.

308
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,298
Why?

309
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,134
I am currently very vulnerable,
Doctor.

310
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,937
I understand ...

311
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,098
Never before my boyfriend was not
wounded.

312
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,009
I need someone strong,
strong like you ...

313
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,893
help me to help prodjem
through all this.

314
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,850
Near the motel. I saw
it.

315
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,655
Maybe we could have lunch there?

316
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,175
Will you help me, doctor?

317
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,453
I'm not sure of ethics ...

318
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,776
But you are a doctor,

319
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,416
You should be helping people.

320
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,698
Enrique? Susan Holland here.

321
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,495
Betina friend.

322
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,254
Her friend is operating today,
It was in the hospital.

323
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,569
What?

324
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,339
Hysterectomy.

325
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,689
Where is the gun now?

326
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,969
I do not know, at Steve's.

327
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,739
With Steve!

328
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,737
To him goes the phone number in
car?

329
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,373
No phone in the car.

330
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,417
With no phone in the car?

331
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,732
He says that only when I was in
car.

332
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,492
No you do not have the phone in the car,
is not it?

333
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,254
I have a cell phone. Talking to you,
is not it?

334
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,252
I love you.

335
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,616
I want to as it
be.

336
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,890
I love you.

337
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,694
I want to as it
be.

338
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,728
I am the most important person in your
life.

339
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,692
I love you.

340
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,376
When I love myself, and others do
love.

341
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,809
Shit.

342
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,373
Why is it crap?

343
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,088
It seems that Steve lost. Is not
behind us.

344
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,529
Yes?

345
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,139
Did you know that Steve does not
phone in the car?

346
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,296
So?

347
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,100
Now we do not know where and with him
weapons.

348
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,974
Will you calm down? What is going on
to do with guns?

349
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,409
How did I know?

350
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,537
All are in "Muso and Frank"
in six, I was "so?

351
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,696
Yes.

352
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,540
Steve will be there and we will
then deal with weapons.

353
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,049
That's it.

354
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,014
All right.

355
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,138
Relax, will you?

356
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,779
See you later.

357
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,175
Lord God!

358
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,216
Hello?

359
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,336
They, I am.

360
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,297
Who?

361
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,450
I. I am.

362
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,212
Steve?

363
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,139
Steve does not have any phone to make and
name is, stupid shit.

364
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,971
Seed?

365
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,411
Yes, I am. Sam said. I am Sam.
Hello?

366
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,496
They?

367
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,775
Seed?

368
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,056
We are located in the "Muso and Frank" in
six, I was "so?

369
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,699
Such is the plan.

370
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,488
Then we find there with Steve
and we will then be

371
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,695
care of weapons.

372
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,611
He will bring a gun?

373
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,128
Why not?

374
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,210
I do not know.

375
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,173
Relax, Bill. Ok?
See you at six.

376
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,091
Lord God!

377
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,615
Seed?

378
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,969
Betty?

379
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,128
Betty?

380
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,973
Chao, Betty here. I want to

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,578
Hi, sweetie, I am.

383
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,775
Bob.

384
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,778
Where were you last night?

385
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,259
I'll call you back.

386
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,451
I love you. Hello.

387
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,252
What time is it?

388
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,211
It's not you watch?

389
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,496
It would like to check.

390
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,737
Around 13:35.

391
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,929
Circle, Bill.

392
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,939
Circle, Roje.

393
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,339
What do you want?

394
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,976
I still have a nintendo?

395
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,649
Yes ...

396
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,688
Pozvaceš me in or not?

397
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,458
Hello, Seed.

398
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,015
Two hours is.

399
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,254
Is there a message?

400
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,008
Only Mr. Bajers asked where you
all day.

401
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,492
What do I do, sugar?

402
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,338
You are a sales agent for
insurance.

403
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,138
Sale, this is the key word.

404
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,972
In the field, I sale of the policy.

405
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,778
Do me your father is not paying for it?

406
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,569
You know, Seeds, one day you will
work for me.

407
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,969
I can not wait.

408
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,618
Hello, Seed.
- Hi, Bill.

409
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,613
Hi, honey, I am.
Bob.

410
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,653
Where were you last night?

411
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,615
I'll call you back.

412
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,297
I love you. Hello.

413
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,330
A slut, Enrique here.

414
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,499
I'm sorry about your friend,
but I expect you here tomorrow. Bye.

415
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,658
Betty, I'm Susan. We are all
become nervous when we sat

416
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,498
with me and we went on
job.

417
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,412
Let me know when you find out the number of Equality
sob ...

418
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,608
Again I am. I hate your
machine!

419
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,852
Call me. I do not like to be
only women with

420
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,971
Moom, Larry and curly.

421
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,533
Hi, Betty. Here, Dr. Kris
Stilman.

422
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,777
Your friend Mr. Holland is
716th resting in the room

423
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,330
I moved it to a separate room.

424
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,333
I really enjoyed our
today's lunch.

425
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,809
Hi, this is Betty. I want to
talk to you so do not

426
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,373
thine ...

427
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,739
Betty, Bob here again.

428
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,135
Enrique says that you are in hospital with
a friend.

429
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,536
Where were you last night? What
going on?

430
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,891
Never to sleep in the bathtub.

431
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,408
Never to sleep in the bathtub.

432
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,968
Hello. You do not mind that you
join, buddy?

433
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,613
I'm waiting for someone.

434
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,976
Business associates?

435
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,693
Wife?

436
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,410
I think it does not matter.

437
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,777
I just wanted a chat,
socialize.

438
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,972
I'm Larry. Larry Cooper.

439
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,929
Larry Cooper?

440
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,209
Larry Cooper.

441
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:43,053
All my life explaining to people:
"No, I'm not Gary Cooper

442
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,856
I am Larry Cooper. "

443
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,979
Get away from me or I will
hurt.

444
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,535
There should be no problems.

445
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,899
As soon as we receive confirmation.

446
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,293
Great.

447
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,129
Good. We hear it.

448
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,250
Hello.

449
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,733
What is it, Penny?

450
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,771
Alimony late, Seed.

451
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,018
I know ... I'm sorry.

452
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,211
You know your job is hanging by a thread.

453
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,498
What are you doing?

454
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,057
You owe me money.

455
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,057
Arise, Seeds.

456
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,375
Come on ...

457
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,219
Stand up.

458
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,772
What is this?

459
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,259
On your knees.

460
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,419
Wait a minute.

461
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,695
I kid you not, Seed.

462
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,652
On your knees.

463
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,009
This is not a good idea.

464
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,529
Yes.

465
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,090
Penny ...

466
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,495
Penny ...

467
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,250
We are unable to do this.

468
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,449
Usually you bring some music
instrument, was I "right?

469
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,970
What we all play? Tom?

470
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,215
Drums.

471
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,179
Drums, that's right.

472
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,256
What are we playing?

473
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,216
Bells!

474
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,058
Tone. All right, Lisa.

475
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,292
Today I thought I was not playing
nothing.

476
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,854
Now let's all get up. Come
here.

477
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,338
Come all.

478
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,371
All, all. And you, Sarah. Come on.

479
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,051
All right.

480
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,774
Who will tell me what we can with
music to do?

481
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,896
To sing.

482
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,409
To sing, very well.
We can sing.

483
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,848
What else can we do with
music?

484
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,413
To razmišIjamo.

485
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,497
To razmišIjamo, well, Kevin.

486
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,651
We can razmišIjamo with music.

487
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,976
But what does music do?

488
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,297
What happens when you start the rhythm?

489
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,695
... The harbor seals, the beach at the mouth
River is a natural refuge

490
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,896
by the sea.

491
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,416
This spring, the beach is full of
females of which only some

492
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,780
gave birth, while others are in advanced
stages of pregnancy.

493
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,576
Making young people in the world is
harmonized with the cycles of the ocean.

494
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,779
Die, Kopilani.

495
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,418
Burn in hell.

496
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,417
Vengeance is mine!

497
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,251
Shit!

498
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,414
Here you have a very long time.
Waiting for someone?

499
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,451
Just wait. That's it.

500
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,571
We earn money from selling drinks.

501
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,048
For now, you drink beer.

502
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,211
All right. Good.

503
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,376
What is your most expensive drink
do you have?

504
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,456
Seriously?

505
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,054
Yes.

506
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,571
Here's fifty dollars.

507
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,655
Chao, Betty here. I want to ...

508
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,777
Wait a minute. Do not lay!

509
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,129
Hello? Hello?

510
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,417
Do not lay! I'm here.

511
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,850
Do not lay! I really am.

512
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,328
Betty, Steve here.

513
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,414
Hi, sugar. Where are you?

514
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,013
The "Muso and Frank."

515
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,414
What are you doing?

516
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,259
I called Susan, but not at
I have a number of units

517
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,779
phone in the car.

518
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,135
Have you learned of the Netherlands
room?

519
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,296
Yes. 716th

520
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,059
This is a separate room.

521
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,337
You sound strange. Are you all right?

522
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,852
Yes, just something I dreamed
bezveze and I got a little scared,

523
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,129
that's all.

524
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,653
You want to stop by?

525
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,259
No ...

526
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,819
Bob called me.

527
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,129
Bob?

528
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,451
You told him it was over, right
not?

529
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,255
Way.

530
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,572
Way? He does not know us, right
not?

531
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,539
Man, he's really mad.
You could hurt me.

532
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,174
No ...

533
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,139
You're my secret secerko.

534
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,256
Better stay at home tonight.

535
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,819
I can not.

536
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,449
I have to find with Chris in
hospital later.

537
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,219
Who is Chris?

538
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,413
The doctor who will help us.

539
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,099
How will it help us?

540
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,133
Just do as I was Suzan
said, okay?

541
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,257
Maybe this is not correct.

542
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,849
Bill and I are three types of shot
times and died.

543
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,612
Maybe I should not die!

544
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,608
Susan and Sam will give us a hundredfold
thousands of dollars when they can

545
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,936
to raise money. Ok?

546
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,172
To be able to raise money
Paul must be dead.

547
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,850
I became friends with Paul,
I brought it to the parking lot,

548
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,580
you shot him! He just
did not die!

549
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,775
That's it!

550
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,409
One hundred thousand dollars, Steve!

551
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,094
I do not plan to work in
hairdresser a lifetime!

552
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,495
I will never serve
tables!

553
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,134
Do you realize what this evening
night mean?

554
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,217
He should be dead!

555
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,254
If it is a choice between
me as a waitress or matore

556
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,695
Poles of death ...

557
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,410
It is simply incomparable.

558
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,849
I have to go.

559
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,454
I have a meeting.

560
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,499
Meeting with Susan?

561
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,128
Why do you ask?

562
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,253
The officer was here today.
Detective Scott.

563
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,254
It seems that the Equality policies
life insurance suddenly

564
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,779
increased last year.

565
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,975
So what?

566
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,092
Susan is still the only
beneficiary of the policy.

567
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,332
Detective Scott was asked to
view your files, Sam.

568
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,533
What have you done?

569
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,935
I told him that he looked
Submission too and it does

570
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,530
I could not put into your
office without a warrant.

571
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,334
Do you know about my relationship with Susan?

572
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,814
I do not think so.

573
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,614
Only suspected it.

574
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,769
I have to go.

575
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,208
You know, seeds ...

576
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,890
Detective Scott does not know for our
connection.

577
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,619
What does this mean?

578
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,811
Fuck Susan, I was "so?

579
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,132
I think I would also like to
fuck Susan.

580
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,211
What are you talking about?

581
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,333
You're much more seed, but not
completely stupid.

582
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,535
And you owe me money.

583
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,694
What exactly do you want to say, Penny?

584
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,819
When Paul died, and Susan took the money,
I want to take part.

585
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,899
're Funny.

586
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,976
Really?

587
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,093
Whose plan is this, seed? Your or
Susan?

588
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,935
Pick up the phone, Seed.

589
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,736
Hello?

590
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,976
Yes, I'll tell her.

591
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,979
Thank you.

592
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,771
Your father has just had a heart
shock.

593
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,928
Sorry!

594
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,816
Hello?

595
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,092
Excuse me?

596
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,689
Can I help you?

597
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,015
Yes!

598
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,218
When you were a patient named
Harold Bajers. He had a heart attack.

599
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,688
Unfortunately, Mr. Bajers on
intensive care.

600
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,331
Visits are not allowed.

601
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,253
Penny! Penny! Penny!

602
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,336
I'm here, Mom.
I'm here.

603
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,893
I am afraid, dear. Much
I'm afraid.

604
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,217
Penny ... Mama ...

605
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,658
Will soon be returning.

606
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,088
Harry dies, and Sam has something
more important to do?

607
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,292
Will immediately come back, Mom.

608
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,013
How's dad? Are you videl?

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,217
MUSO and Frank
BBQ

610
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,898
Where is Sam?

611
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,653
You may be stuck in traffic.

612
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,215
Could occur. Is there
phone in the car?

613
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,899
There are mobile.

614
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,654
We will wait another fifteen minutes and
I shall call Bob.

615
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,574
Bob?

616
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,815
What would Bob do?

617
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,488
Bob is our support. Waiting for our
call all day.

618
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,770
If you do not invite half of eight,
will go home.

619
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,410
Bob will kill Holanda?

620
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,973
Paul could you recognize,
so ...

621
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,499
That's right, Susan.

622
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,859
It is a good plan.

623
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,535
Thank you.

624
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,052
What time is it?
-19.16.

625
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,330
Sorry.

626
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,770
Sorry.

627
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,254
Where were you, dammit?

628
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,213
Penina's father had a heart attack.
I was in the hospital.

629
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,170
Which hospital?

630
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,779
In Polovoj hospital.

631
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,339
Super. This is really great.

632
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,009
Somebody call Bob before half
eight.

633
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,053
Good. I heard it.

634
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,249
Where's the gun?

635
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,250
In our pockets.

636
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,495
And with you?

637
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,618
Armed and dangerous.

638
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,213
I was "Bob's your name?

639
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,896
We are ready?

640
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,096
Steve and I are waiting in the lobby of the

642

Betty?

643
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,570
I have to go to find the
Stilmanom doctor for approximately

644
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,537
ten minutes.

645
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,289
Why do not you do now?

646
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,250
Ok.

647
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,539
See you later.

648
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,611
Hello.

649
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,571
I love you.

650
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,929
I know!

651
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,173
You know what I did today?
- No.

652
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,099
I went and played with relatives
I have video games.

653
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,779
That's all I did.

654
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,533
All afternoon.

655
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,134
Great, Bill.

Huh!

658
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,771
Muddle through the language and the
talking.

659
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,699
Bile, Bob is your friend. That
Is there a problem with drink?

660
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,214
Yet he was at the bar all day.

661
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,614
Do you have a problem with drink?

662
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,253
Not that I know.

663
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,415
Maybe he was tired.

664
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,416
Susan?

665
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,975
No, he understood what I said
only he was drunk.

666
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,056
Ok.

667
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,978
Now go back.

668
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,929
Wait in the car.

Whatever happens, wait for the
car.

670
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,458
I brought Steve paper bag.

671
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,416

672
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,652
Please, go and wait in the lobby.
Be on the lookout.

673
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,848
No worries.

674

Bob will appear and will be all the
OK.

675
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,894
Use a pillow Equality.

676
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,775
Pillow?

677
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,136
To repress it. No noise.

678
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,170
That's it.

679
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,134
Of course ... This is me with myocardial

00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,498
There is a further exercise for
inner thigh.

687
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,772
Additional exercise strengthens the inner
thighs and hips.

688
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,211
Press the legs, firm front
and rear thigh muscles ...

689
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,337
Doctor, can you help me,
please?

690
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,330
If you can not.

691
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,094
Bajers Harold, my father,
was transferred to intensive care.

692
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,250
We can not find it.

693
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,013
It was necessary to move him in
a separate room.

694
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,090
They lost it!

695
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,659
Will not even let us go on
intensive,

696
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,618
and no one knows where they put it.

697
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,569
They try to kill my husband.
Why are they doing? Where is he?

698
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,288
Ladies, come with me.

699

OK?
- Thank you.

702
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,056
You're welcome.

703
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,295
Jerry told me a good joke.
- Yes?

704
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,488
The telephone rings in the middle of the night,
a man appeared and said:

705
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,215
"How do I know? It is thirty
kilometers away. "

706
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,449
The woman asks, "Who was that?"

707
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,337
Some jerk who asks me to
Is the coast clear.

708
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,335
Listen to this.

709
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,977
Two lawyers are sitting at the bar,
beautiful girl passes and one

710
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,529
says: "I wish that the fights".

711
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,890
Another asks: "For what?"

712
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,773
Who are you?

713
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,495
Are you crazy?

714
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,813
Stephen King.

715
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,015
I'm not sure if it's okay to
I walk in with you.

716
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,771
Glupiraj not be. Paul is the only
friend.

717
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,456
All the same, this is ... unpleasant
situation for me.

718
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,849
Stop.

719
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,093
Betty!

720
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,579
Chao, sugar. How do you feel?

721
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,219
Now I felt better.

722
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,335
Kiss me.

723
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,652
You call that a kiss?

724
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,612
I'm sure the doctor and
have seen people that Ijube.

725
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,969
How do you feel today, sir
Holland?

726
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,297
I feel much better now that
Betty is here.

727
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,330
Have you met Ms.
Johnson?

728
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,888
Yes, we ...

729
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,816
yeah.

730
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,291
Doctor Stilman said you had
best of luck!

731
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,573
How so?

732
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,894
You have received three times without
serious injuries.

733
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,131
Yes, because I will sleep easier,
Doctor.

734
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,133
And I do not think that much
happy to be shot at all.

735
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,290
Of course.

736
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,533
You're happy and you know it.

737
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,015
Happy in love.

738
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,217
I'll go.

739
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:51,648
Ispraticu Stilmana doctors and
Be right back.

740
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,499
Paul was just a friend? What does it
to?

741
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,571
And Paul is my friend.

742
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,540
And you're my friend.

743
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,893
How many true friends you
do you have?

744
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,895
Meet me in the "House of blues"
tomorrow at half past nine.

745
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,251
Betty! Come back!

746
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,216
"House of blues", half a decade.

747
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,535
Wait, wait ...

748
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,814
Are you all right?

749
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,573
I'm fine.

750
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,690
Services should not be so
moving around.

751
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,779
It hurts.

752
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,777
Much sorry.

753
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,813
It was my fault.

754
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,970
Try to sleep now.

755
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,097
Why have you brought me to that
parking lot this morning?

756
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,295
It was supposed to meet there,
remember?

757
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,219
Why have not you been there?

758
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,379
I'm a little late, only five
minutes I was late ...

759
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,936
and emergency assistance and has already led to
hospital.

760
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,058
I do not know what they want with my
handbag,

761
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,769
in my papers.

762
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,539
I'm tired.

763
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,418
I am so tired.

764
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,651
I was exhausted.

765
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,211
Sleep now.

766
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,698
Papers hell ...

767
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:48,049
What they wanted with my papers?

768
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,329
What is it?

769
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,089
What happened?

770
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,574
How can you not sleep?

771
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,855
Sorry.

772
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,090
I am amazed that you can so ...
zakunjaš.

773
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,891
So what?

774
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,694
Are not you nervous at all?

775
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,698
Why should I be nervous?

776
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,212
This was an unusual day for
me and I am pretty tense,

777
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,779
that's all.

778
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,296
This is a BETA?

779
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,258
Why do you ask?

780
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,529
I just wonder ...

781
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,889
What are you asking?

782
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,897
What do you mean?

783
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,774
I heard her and that you are now two
often said that you love her.

784
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,169
I?

785
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,615
I thought it was with Bob.

786
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,055
It was with Bob when we
met,

787
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,171
now with me.

788
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,053
Do you and Bob know that?

789
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,854
What to do with you?

790
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,819
Bob is a dangerous character!

791
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:02,093
I do not want to find me while
karam his girlfriend.

792
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,258
Let me worry about me.

793
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,739
I once saw Bob
killed a man.

794
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,258
When did this happen?

795
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,172
When we were in Soledad.

796
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,769
Mexican.

797
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,213
You and I have also killed the man.

798
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:32,694
First: we shot it, we did not
killed by the hands.

799
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,331
Second, we killed him and why
sitting here.

800
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,691
And thirdly, the plan is now to be Bob
kill.

801
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,456
Which will mean that Bob killed
at least two people,

802
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,093
and who knows what everything is done
for which we do not know.

803
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,978
Your point is ...?

804
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,536
My point is ...

805
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,210
I think your friend
Betty is not worth the risk

806
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,455
which incur.

807
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,934
You know nothing about it.

808
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,811
I know that she was with Bob.

809
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,738
I know that she was with you.

810
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,613
How do you think is persuaded
Holland to appear exactly where

811
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,418
where we wanted?

812
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,690
You mean that was the
Holland?

813
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,097
For one hundred thousand dollars and I would
a fight with the Netherlands.

814
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,699
Good. This conversation is over.

815
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,054
What happens?

816
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,811
Bob. Are you štucao?

817
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:27,412
Why?

818
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,615
You talk about me?

819
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,693
He told me as you killed the
Mexicans in Soledad.

820
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,619
Bill tells everything. A lot of shit,
Were, right?

821
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,617
Yes, sir. Many serem.

822
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,410
Bob. Steve. Bile.

823
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,534
716th Room

824
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,732
He is 716th in the room

825
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,776
Use a pillow.

826
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,850
Pillow?

827
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,611
Yes, it ugušiš.

828
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,729
I never did.

829
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,138
How hard can it be?

830
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,659
If it is so easy, you do so.

831
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,097
What do you mean? He put a pillow
through the mouth and nose that can not

832
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,858
breathes heavily and push it down.

833
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,255
Three times he was shot, probably
on sedatives.

834
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,690
How hard will be ... Bob?

835
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,976
716?
- Yes.

836
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,648
Please, Bob, go.

837
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,409
I want another fifty.

838
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,130
Excuse me?

839
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,773
Now I want a hundred and fifty thousand.

840
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,976
It's not fair!

841
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,730
If he gets another fifty,
we want.

842
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,856
Yes!

843
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,373
Come to school and honor, Bob.

844
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,135
Today we will learn how to
strengthen and streamline your stomach

845
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,535
and how to develop strong,
healthy back.

846
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,456
You know, Bill is right that this is not
fair.

847
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,333
Fuck It! Now everything depends on
me and I want another fifty.

848
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,768
We agreed for the money.

849
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,016
I changed my mind.

850
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,690
Bob, we are in this together, right
not?

851
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,216
She grabbed you and Steve in
insurance fraud.

852
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,608
They are idiots.

853
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,811
Decided that they're in angažuješ
his fraud.

854
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,214
You and Susan have a plan, right?

855
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,173
Bill and Steve are amateurs, you have to
quickly realized,

856
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,779
then you asked them whether they have
someone who can help them if

857
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,930
screw around.

858
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,732
Are screwed, here's me.

859
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,898
I want another fifty thousand dollars
or nothing deal.

860
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,693
If we accept this, we have
words are not going to promise that neither Bill

861
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,776
Steve or Betty.

862
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,737
What this has to do with Betty?

863
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,929
Beti ... I did not tell Betty.

864
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,090
I told you Betty!

865
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,369
I did not think Betty.

866
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,019
It sounded like Betty.

867
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,893
Bill, the fifth, Bill, Bill ...

868
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,533
BETA was involved in this?

869
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:31,776
Ask him.

870
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,689
Where is Betty?
- I do not know.

871
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,858
I asked you where Betty.

872
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,339
Is there some problem here?

873
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,729
Bob, do not do it.

874
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,570
Throw the gun in his hands
up!

875
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,856
Are you crazy?

876
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,812
Fuck you!

877
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,536
Bile!

878
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,768
Help!

879
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,011
Help!

880
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,491
Help!

881
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,968
You frightened me.

882
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,969
Ugly you dream?

883
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,250
Ugly?

884
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:06,976
Yes.

885
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,417
Dude!

886
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,694
What about you?

887
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,176
Damn.

888
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,415
For God's sake ...

889
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,850
Sorry.

890
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,214
Gave me a fright.
- Sorry.

891
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,853
It's okay, just that I have not seen
to come.

892
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,053
Is there a trace of Bob?
- No.

893
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,659
How is Harry?

894
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,414
That bastard will probably die of
age.

895
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,492
How is Penny?

896
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,969
Why?

897
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,774
Her father has just had a heart attack,
Seed. What about you?

898
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,335
Sorry. You can not blame me as
I am a little nervous.

899
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,571
"A little nervous" is fine.

900
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,017
What do we do now?

901
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,690
We can not wait to Bob.

902
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,894
Go in and tell those
clowns to go to room 716 and

903
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,619
to finish what they started.

904
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,813
Perhaps you're right.

905
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,692
Almost always I was right.

906
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,376
What?

907
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,735
Nothing.

908
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,493
Then kiss me.

909
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,010
Stay here.

910
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,053
Will you marry me?

911
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,898
What?

912
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,609
Rewind back a bit.

913
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,568
It does not matter.

914
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,933
It does not matter?

915
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,056
I was not even aware that we
discussed marriage.

916
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,177
I'm sorry that I mentioned!

917
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,691

To clear up?

920
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,497
Do you need a broom to talk
about it?

921
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,496
Janice ...

922
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,298
We go out for a year.

00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,252
I almost live here.

924
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,850
We went on the trip.

925
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,537
I do not see a problem?

926
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,414
Not once did not you tell me
love.

927
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,296

00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,535
Look at me!

929
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,254
I am 28 years old and my boyfriend
Doctor does not recognize anything

930
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,052
more than skiing!

931
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,779
Where did this?

932
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,969
Fuck you!

933
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,615
For God's sake ...

934
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,539
Janice ...

935
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,373

00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,453
Can we talk about that now

939
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,974
Can we now get back in
bed

940
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,212

941
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,099
Brian called me this afternoon.

942
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,099
Brian, lažIjivo trash bitch
son, and he called?

943
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,218
He wants to reconcile.

944
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,411
What did you tell him?

945
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,580
I told him that he proposed to me.

946
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,698
I told him that we are engaged.

947
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,972
Ok.

948
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,496
You want to sleep now?

949
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,854
Five installments of just 19.95.

00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,539
Imagine, you look like for

951
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,579
Here you go.

952
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,056
Why I was on that morning
parking lot?

953

Do not worry.

963
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,217
You're just part of Suzaninog plan.

964
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,451
I do not know what you're talking.

965
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,333
It took me some time to
understand.

966
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,452
Now you have to own me

967
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,891
Waiting for someone to help you?

Kill me now or I will get stuck
in big trouble.

00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,253
Sam is involved in this?

971
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,615
Who else?

972
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,299
Hello? The police?

973
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,259
All right. Give me the phone.

979
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,937
Why have you made such an expression
persons?

980
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,576
I dreamed that you died.

981
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,053
Come.

982
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,778
I do not want to hurt you.

983
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,333
Kiss me.

984
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,659
What is it?

985
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,055
PažIjivo, PažIjivo.

986
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,859
I'm sorry.

987
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,773
I can not stand it.

988
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,132
No, I'm sorry to be a part of this.

989
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,979
Part of what?

990
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,778
I thought I could.

991
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,569
I thought I would be nothing for
enough money.

992
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,615
You know the guys who made me
shot?

993
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,050
These are just two of the
I know, and Sam and Susan.

994
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,773
The plan is Susan.

995
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,295
It was not my idea, its
ideas.

996
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,615
To kill me?

997
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,769
Exactly.

998
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,412
To kill you.

999
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,892
Susan said that you can
believe.

1000
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,975
Please do not kill me,
Seed.

1001
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,572
Why have such an expression?

1002
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,692
I thought I could.

1003
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,733
I thought I would be nothing for
enough money.

1004
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,419
You know the guys who made me
shot?

1005
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,568
These are just two of the
I know.

1006
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,813
Sam and Susan are concerned.
The plan is Susan.

1007
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,169
It was not my idea, its
ideas.

1008
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,256
To kill me?

1009
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,973
Betty.

1010
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,456
This is your chance to order
this remarkable device.

1011
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,135
You want a solid body?

1012
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,575
This is an easy way to get it.
- Megafeks.

1013
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,335
Introducing Megafeks.
A device for shaping the whole

1014
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,609
body ...

1015
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,730
Do not wake him.

1016
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,252
What irony. "Do not you
wake up. "

1017
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,732
I can not watch ...

1018
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,415
Who are you?

1019
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,254
That's what I wanted to ask you.

1020
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,973
Why is a pillow on his face?

1021
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,575
I did not want it to television
troubled.

1022
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,730
It looks pretty good for someone
who was hit three times.

1023
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,896
Sorry ... Who are you?

1024
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,568
I am Penny Bajers, Equality old
friend. And you are?

1025
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,856
Betty Johnson.

1026
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,614
My father was in the room down the hall,
had a heart attack.

1027
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,408
Much sorry.

1028
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,732
No, that's okay. Recover.
How long do you know Paul?

1029
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,775
Have fun for a while.

01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,613
You're his girlfriend?

1031
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,214
In a way.

1032
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,060
How long can fuck with him?

1033
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,209
Excuse me?

1034
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,418
Girl you have it, you were sleeping
together.

1035
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,213
What should you care?

1036
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,853
Do you know Sam?

1037
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,016
We have common friends.

1038
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,249
As Paul?

1039
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,695
Yes, among others.

1040
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,219
You also are involved in Suzanne's plan?

1041
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,774
What plan?

1042
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,171
You do not have to be a genius to
ukapiraš what is going on here.

1043
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,249
What do you want?

1044
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,978
How is Harry?
- More sleep.

1045
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,499
Where's Penny?

1046
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,656
She went to walk.

1047
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,570
Will look for it.

1048
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,896
Seed.

01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,972
Harry has always been good
friend.

1051
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,733
Harry is a nerd.

1052
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:47,092
When you cheated on my Penny, I
I kicked out and so frme

1053
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,774
quickly that he did not know what you

1054
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,373
You're just upset, Mom.

1055
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,216
Penny will look for.

1056
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,853
That was fast.

1057
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,294
Will wait here.

1058
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,338

Tense you are, Mom. I do not think
so.

1061
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,209
They should not see me here.

1062
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,974
You will be quiet?

1063
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,251
He's dead.

1064
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:40,260
Ok, you need to go.

1065
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,853
Hi, Mom.

1066
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,539
You must be asking who these
People.

01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,617
Will you not answer the phone,
Seed?

1068
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,895
Yes.

1069
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,293

I think you've turned the wrong
number. There is no ...

1072
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,770

1073
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,056

I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

I was "it was Susan?

1077
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,451
I think about it should
talk some other time.

1078
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,695
Susan who?

1079
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,529
Do not go up.

1080
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,496
Do you want something to eat?
- No, thanks.

1081
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,374
You have a nice house.

1082
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,129
Drinks?

1083
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,098
Do you have a Jack Daniels?

1084
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,249
Glenlivet?

1085
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,818
No. Scotch, whiskey.

1086
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,738
Glenlivet Scotch and is.

1087
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,289
Really?

1088
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,375
Led?

1089
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,775
Pure.

1090
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,699
Semperfaj.

1091
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,049
How well do you know Betty
Johnson?

1092
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,893
She was a hairdresser.

1093
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,135
Why?

1094
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,251
Are you a person who acts as
can be trusted?

1095
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,014
If not, we're all fucked.

1096
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,493
I do not understand.

1097
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,331
I mean, if you can not
trust your hairdresser,

1098
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,616
where can you?

1099
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,415
It is thoughtfully.

1100
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,611
You want one?

1101
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,729
What a thrill! A man was killed
only two rooms away.

1102
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,690
What can I say? The world has gone mad.

1103
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,971
Harry? Harry is good.

1104
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,337
But all this noise here! People are running
around,

1105
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,498
up and down. I'll be awake all night.

1106
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,855
Who was killed?

1107
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,611
Harry woke up. I'll call you.

1108
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,249
How do you feel?

1109
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,052
As if I had a heart attack!

1110
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,689
To call the nurse?
- Yes, I call it.

1111
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,976
Wait.

1112
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,369
Who was killed?

1113
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,009
I do not know!

1114
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,256
Did not you just said that someone
killed?

1115
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,576
I do not know his name. A man
from a nearby room.

1116
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,770
Here?

1117
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:47,850
Down the hall?

1118
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:49,777
A man was killed?

1119
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,009
Now I have to say.

1120
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,216
Who is he?

1121
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:55,418
For God's sake, Harry, what do you want from
me?

1122
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,180
I have already told you that I do not know!

1123
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,974
Why are you yelling at me?

1124
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:21,209
I want to do that, Seeds.

1125
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,536
I want to be together, to
we have a lot of money,

1126
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,618
and to go in LA.

1127
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,739
I want Paul to die.

1128
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,817
Just hate it?

1129
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,853
I think I hate myself for him
allowed me much harm.

1130
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,339
Listen, I agree.

1131
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,332
I'll do it with you, Susan.

1132
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,693
But I do it for the money. I do not
I hate Paul.

1133
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,499
I hate what I do for the father of the former
women.

1134
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,213
I just want you.

1135
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,808
I want to be with you.

1136
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,571
I want to be in a great
place.

1137
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,170
Hawaii ...

1138
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:57,976
Italy ...

1139
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,178
For a great place.

1140
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,532
Why did you lift up the handset
last night?

1141
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,496
Sorry, I could not talk.

1142
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,689
Why could you not talk?

1143
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:57,850
That was you?

1144
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:00,690
I was in Harijevoj room.

1145
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,534
We were in Harijevoj room.

1146
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,492
Why were you all in Harijevoj
room?

1147
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,889
and I would like to know.

1148
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,093
Penny broke a plan.

1149
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,696
The detective asked her for gender
policy.

1150
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,252
She's not stupid, Susan, ok?
Will share.

1151
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:16,975
Wait a minute.

1152
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,378
And she was there.

1153
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,258
And she was an accomplice,

1154
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,018
has no advantage over us.

1155
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,653
It was where and when?

1156
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,134
When he killed Bob Holland.

1157
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,894
No one except me and the Netherlands was
I killed the Netherlands.

1158
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,171
Room 716, I was "so?

1159
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:33,331
In fact, Bob, I was hiding in the
bathroom with Penny,

1160
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,859
and Steve was with ...

1161
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,819
Betty under the bed.

1162
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,649
That's it.

1163
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,290
Get out of here.

1164
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,779
Thank you, Carlos.

1165
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,575
Enrique.

1166
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,139
You're a friend.

1167
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:04,209
Only you look out on my mini, baby.
Got it?

1168
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,973
I pick up when you arrive in Vegas.

1169
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,537
This is our little secret, okay?

1170
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,695
What, what?

1171
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,810
Betty slut?

1172
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,091
It has long been gone.

1173
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,768
No, man, swept from
Wind.

1174
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,896
Caos.

1175
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,296
Hello?

1176
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,774
Hello, Susan, Paul said.

1177
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,370
Who is it?

1178
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,690
Paul, baby.

1179
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,778
There was an accident, in hospital
I.

1180
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,294
But I'm fine, do not worry.

1181
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,576
Who do you talk?

1182
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,370
Pol.

1183
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:04,577
What?

1184
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,411
Hello?

1185
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,216
Hello?

1186
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,978
Who called you, Susan?

1187
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,895
The phone is ringing.

1188
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,773
I have not heard to ring.

1189
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,219
Someone at the door.

1190
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,328
Good afternoon, Mrs. Holland.

1191
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:34,650
Good morning.

1192
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,699
You are, Mrs. Holland?

1193
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,576
Yes.

1194
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,613
Are you sure?

1195
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,413
Of course I'm sure.

1196
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:45,857
I set up surveillance on your
house and this morning at 4:36

1197
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:51,970
here you are with a man, whites,
1.90, brown hair.

1198
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,252
Subsequently, three more
men arrived with three

1199
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,015
different cars that are more
always parked in front.

1200
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,815
You may want to discuss your
answer?

1201
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,537
Maybe I called my lawyer.

1202
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,688
Hi, guys.

1203
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,852
They do not say anything.

1204
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,449
Oh, fuck off.

1205
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,494
Do you love me?

1206
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,773
It seems to me.

1207
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,897
You really are an asshole.

1208
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,654
This is also my mother in law and she
last night.

1209
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:59,009
There he is!

1210
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,699
Stop or I'll shoot!

1211
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,376
Hit it! Please help!

1212
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,730
Come on.

1213
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:18,497
What are you doing?

1214
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:19,410
Come on!

1215
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,251
Please help! Please!

01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,460
Come on!

1217
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:28,975
God!

1218
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:33,856
Shit!

1219
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,133
Bring a helicopter here. Immediately.

1220
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,175
Let's go. Come on!

1221
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,573
Go after them!

1222
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:02,211
What now?

1223
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:03,974
I do not know, tell me.

1224
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,374
The house of my friends there.

1225
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:25,578
Hi, Bonnie. I was "your mother at
units?

1226
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,298
What happened to you dvoma?

1227
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,172
Complicated.

1228
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,569
Do you have a metal pliers?

1229
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:32,730
For a living fence?

1230
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,808
Saw? Anything?

1231
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,773
Carol, we need your
assistance.

1232
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:43,775
To the police, Mom. It does not seem
anything stupid.

1233
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,256
Your mother may herself to
decisions, Betty.

1234
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,699
I'm sorry, Carol.

1235
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,692
The keys of my car on
coffee table in the hallway.

1236
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,931
Mama!

1237
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,171
Thank you, this is a very Ijubazno of

1239
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:02,970
with your hands behind your back!

1240
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:03,612
Do not shout!

1241
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:04,730
Sorry to shout!

1242
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,571
Are there any tools in
home?

1243
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,173
In the garage, perhaps?

1244
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,334
Stop! Stop!

1245
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,136
I do not know where the puppy is held tool.
I'm sorry.

1246
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,292
Good morning, Detective Scott.

1247
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,772
Ms. Bajers ...

1248
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,892
This is a patrolman Francis.

1249
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,529
How can I help you?

1250
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,854
Turn to the right.

1251
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:48,378
Turn to the right, please.

1252
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,130
To the right.

1253
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:07,217
Do not move or I'll shoot!

1254
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,490
Betty Johnson?

1255
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,019
She is long gone.

1256
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,256
Gone with the Wind is.

1257
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:45,899
So beautiful white girl. What did you
done?

1258
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,410
Thank you.

1259
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,135
Thank you.

1260
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,575
Be right back.

1261
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,494
How are you, Betty?

1262
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,140
Sorry, we do know?

1263
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,694
Skiing accident.

1264
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:39,018
You know, I went to
"House of blues" that evening.

1265
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,137
Since Mr. Holland was killed and
all ...

1266
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,773
You understand.

1267
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,576
Surely you have me confused with someone.

1268
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,249
Is there a problem here, Candy?

1269
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,578
No, no problem.

1270
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,969
I was mixed up with someone.

1271
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:10,898
So? More gambling or even
Gambling? What?

1272
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,172
Krise?

1273
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,410
Come out for a meal.
