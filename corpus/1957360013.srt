1
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,431
<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

2
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,099
someone's in my house.

3
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,725
 All right,
settle down, settle down.

4
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:09,653
As you all know, captain
of the cheerleading squad

5
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:12,415
Will be announced tomorrow.

6
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,008
I've tabulated
all of your votes,

7
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,827
But ultimately, as always,

8
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,681
I will be making
the final decision.

9
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:23,167
I don't need to remind you
that being cheer captain

10
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,746
Is about more than proficiency
with your routines.

11
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:30,917
You all have that
or you wouldn't be here.

12
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,844
Being captain is an honor.

13
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:35,438
It means that you personify

14
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,925
Everything that we want
in a cheerleader:

15
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:43,446
Pride, determination,
selflessness,

16
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,690
And above all, integrity.

17
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,785
It means that when
people see you, they say,

18
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,716
"now that's a pine hills
high school cheerleader."

19
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,385
Now go hit the showers.
I'll see you tomorrow.

20
00:02:57,536 --> 00:02:58,702
Okay, thanks, coach.

21
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,037
You got this, you know.

22
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,949
Come on.
I don't have anything

23
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,451
Come on, did you hear
coach johnson?

24
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,729
She may have been
talking directly to you.

25
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,546
Don't be ridiculous.

26
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:12,049
Okay, you've been on the team
since freshman year.

27
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,069
You're the best cheerleader
we have.

28
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:18,297
You head all the fundraising
committees. I mean, come on!

29
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:21,892
Okay, okay, stop.
You're embarrassing me.

30
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,487
I'm just saying. If you're not
named team captain tomorrow,

31
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,306
There's gonna be a revolt,
and I'd be the one to lead it.

32
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,992
You're my best friend, kate,
and I love you,

33
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,828
But I think you might be
underestimating the other girls.

34
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,339
Okay, then who else?

35
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:38,426
Big smile, right,
big smile.

36
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,577
Up, down, right.

37
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,430
Anna?

38
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,325
Why not? Did you see
her dismount from the pyramid?

39
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,770
I couldn't do that,
even on my best day.

40
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:52,331
Em, anna's been here for like,
what, two seconds?

41
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,442
I don't care how good she is.

42
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,019
There's no way coach johnson
is gonna choose a new girl

43
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,113
Over someone who's been here
all of high school.

44
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,782
No way!

45
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:05,845
Well, I hope you're right.

46
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:08,289
Have you ever known me
to be wrong?

47
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,633
Sweetheart, I'm home!

48
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,877
Hey, mom.

49
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,696
Hey.

50
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,215
Mmm! What's for dinner?

51
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,142
Caesar salad
with grilled shrimp.

52
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:30,036
And I think
there's some leftover

53
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:32,371
Chicken teriyaki skewers
from last night.

54
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,798
Ah, you spoil me.

55
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,559
That's okay. I enjoy cooking.

56
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,210
You know, one of these days,

57
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,637
You're gonna make some man
very happy.

58
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,565
Ew, mom,
that's so old-fashioned.

59
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,325
okay, okay.

60
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,643
I'm gonna put my things away,
and I'll be right back.

61
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,162
Okay.

62
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:54,001
Nice! So how was practice?

63
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,580
Fine. Emma's nervous
that she won't be named captain.

64
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:58,914
Maybe she won't.

65
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,008
Mom, that's ridiculous.

66
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,918
She's basically been
primed for this

67
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,072
Since we were in little leaders
in fourth grade.

68
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,907
Why didn't you try out
for captain?

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,167
It's not a matter
of trying out.

70
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,853
Anyone can vote for anyone,

71
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,021
And then coach
makes the final decision.

72
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,583
I just don't want you
to sell yourself short.

73
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:20,269
I'm not.
I'm just being realistic.

74
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,588
Besides, em is nervous
about the new girl

75
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:23,923
That just transferred here.

76
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,591
What about her?

77
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,035
I mean, she's good.
Like real good.

78
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,354
You're really good.

79
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,764
I know.

80
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:33,616
My ego is plenty healthy.
Don't worry.

81
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,043
Well, I'm sure coach johnson
will make the right decision.

82
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,195
Yeah, we'll see.

83
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,272
So how was work?

84
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,050
I know, I know.

85
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,294
You work twice as hard
for half as much.

86
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,796
- Exactly.
- But I told you a million times

87
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:50,224
That you should have become
a lawyer instead of a paralegal.

88
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,059
If I had known your father
was gonna walk out on us,

89
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,619
I would've.

90
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:56,880
- Mom, don't start.
- Okay, okay.

91
00:05:56,974 --> 00:06:00,050
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake that I made.

92
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,644
And what's that?

93
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:04,647
That college is for your future
and not just for fun.

94
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,482
Mom, it can be both.

95
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,410
And don't worry. I actually
was planning on signing up

96
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,061
For campus tours
for fall break.

97
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:13,656
Ah! That's my girl!

98
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,474
And let me tell you something.

99
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:18,494
If it were up to me,
I would have named you captain.

100
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,162
I know, I know, mom.

101
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,073
So tell me some more
about this new girl.

102
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,152
Okay. Her name is anna barton.
She just transferred here,

103
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,654
And she already thinks
that she becomes captain.

104
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:29,680
Hmm.

105
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,161
You have nothing to worry about.
Will you stop it?

106
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,012
<i> I won't sleep tonight.</i>
<i> I know it.</i>

107
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,441
<i> I'm gonna spend the entire</i>
<i> night staring at my ceiling.</i>

108
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,835
Then text me every minute,

109
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,338
Like I did to you
the night before sats.

110
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:49,266
<i> Nighttime 7-eleven run?</i>

111
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,768
I can't.
I'm already dressed for bed.

112
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:55,772
Besides, I promised my mom I'd
sign up for some campus tours.

113
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,125
Hey, call shane.

114
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,519
You know he'd be over
before you even hang up.

115
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,521
<i> Shane is good</i>
<i> for a lot of things.</i>

116
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,023
<i> Patient reassurance</i>
<i> is not one of them.</i>

117
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,466
<i> That's what you're for.</i>

118
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,618
Yeah, but at least he can
take your mind off of it.

119
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:09,953
That's what he's for.

120
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,213
<i> That's true.</i>

121
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,974
<i> Okay, I'll call him.</i>

122
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,884
<i> But I'm serious.</i>
<i> If you hear that 3 a.M. Ping,</i>

123
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,053
<i> You better not pretend</i>
<i> to be asleep.</i>

124
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,146
I swear.

125
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,706
Love you.

126
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,233
<i> Love you too.</i>

127
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:36,055
 Am I in trouble?

128
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,814
Why would you think that?

129
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,575
Because in my experience,

130
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:41,410
When you're asked to come
to the principal's office,

131
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,487
It's never a good thing.

132
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,564
Well, in this case,
you have nothing to worry about.

133
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,585
So I was just looking to see
how you were liking pine hills.

134
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,178
- Really?
- Of course.

135
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,756
It isn't easy
to transfer to a new school,

136
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,090
Especially
for your senior year.

137
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:56,500
Well, it's okay, I guess.

138
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,594
Okay, well, is there
anything that I can do

139
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,670
To make your transition
easier for you?

140
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,357
No, no, I don't think so.

141
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,419
Oh, okay, well, if there is,
you know where to find me.

142
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:09,271
Thank you, ms. Simpson.

143
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,273
Sit down, miss barton.

144
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,926
There is one more thing.

145
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:17,371
Pine hills isn't necessarily
a small school,

146
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,766
But in many ways,
we are a tight-knit community.

147
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:23,269
You know why
I'm telling you all this?

148
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,695
I believe you do.

149
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,606
I reviewed your transcript,

150
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,700
Which I would do
for any incoming student.

151
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,112
Um, academically,
very impressive.

152
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,555
Thank you.

153
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:36,206
But as important
as academics are,

154
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,300
There are things
which are equally important.

155
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:42,638
Occasionally, we have issues
like any other high school does,

156
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:45,641
But overall, I'm happy to say
that we're not plagued

157
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:49,052
By many of the problems other
high schools are plagued with.

158
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:50,963
Is there something
you'd like to say to me, ma'am?

159
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:54,650
I guess the best way to say this
is, in my experience,

160
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,153
There are people
who avoid trouble,

161
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,915
And then there are people
who trouble seems to follow.

162
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,491
And you're wondering
which one I am.

163
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,643
- Can you blame me?
- That was an accident.

164
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,253
It could have happened
to anyone.

165
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:07,813
An accident which cost you

166
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,665
Your position
on the cheerleading squad,

167
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,760
Which is one of the reasons
that you're here at pine hill.

168
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,003
You don't have to worry
about me, ms. Simpson,

169
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,680
I assure you.

170
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,617
 All right, people,

171
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:56,286
I've kept you waiting
long enough.

172
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
This year's cheer captain,

173
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:03,627
As voted on by her peers
and fully supported by me,

174
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,796
Is none other...
Than emma rogers.

175
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,391
- go, emma!

176
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,652
Yay!

177
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,729
- Whoo!
- Yes!

178
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,138
Congratulations, emma.

179
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,806
Thanks, anna.

180
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,993
You deserve it.

181
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,644
Congratulations.

182
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,646
It was well-deserved.

183
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,665
Is there anything that you'd
like to say to your teammates?

184
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,576
Um, I just want to thank
everyone who voted for me.

185
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,244
And those that didn't,

186
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,339
I still promise to be
the best cheer captain possible

187
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:37,085
And represent all of you,
the squad, and the school.

188
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,013
Now let's get to work!

189
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,441
Left...

190
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,421
Anna, come on in.

191
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,013
Do you have a minute,
coach johnson?

192
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,273
Always, anna.

193
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:00,850
Now, what's on your mind?

194
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,037
Well, it's...

195
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:05,522
Just that I was a little
surprised by the decision.

196
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,933
- Oh?
- Well, I was kind of hoping

197
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:10,102
That I would be named
cheer captain.

198
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:11,212
And you think
that you deserve it?

199
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,272
If I'm being honest,

200
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,958
I really believe I'm a better
cheerleader than emma.

201
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,384
I have better stamina,

202
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,703
I get higher on the jumps,
my landings are clearer.

203
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,947
I can-- I can do
all these other things--

204
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,392
Miss barton,
I've already explained

205
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,063
That being captain isn't
determined by your skills.

206
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,139
It's also about
your dedication to the team.

207
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,791
Yeah, but I am dedicated, coach.

208
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:35,310
I take the team rules
as seriously as anyone.

209
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,554
Look, you're talented.

210
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,556
Very talented.

211
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:42,634
And I shouldn't be saying this,
but if it wasn't for emma,

212
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,803
You would've been named
cheer captain.

213
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:45,895
Really?

214
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,397
But you just moved here.

215
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,141
I had no choice!

216
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,326
My other school, I just--
I couldn't go back.

217
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,254
Do you want to talk about it?

218
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,499
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

219
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,153
The point is, the other girls,
they hardly know you.

220
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:03,913
I've been doing cheer
my entire life.

221
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,584
My mom was the captain
of her college team.

222
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,845
I wanted this really badly.

223
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,514
I understand. I do.

224
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,442
The good news is there's going
to be plenty of opportunities

225
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,336
Throughout the season for you
to take a leadership role.

226
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,339
I am a senior!
By then, it won't matter.

227
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:23,175
There can only be
one cheer captain.

228
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,027
It's natural
for the other cheerleaders

229
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,787
To feel disappointed.

230
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,623
The best way to handle this

231
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:33,127
Is to think of how you can
best help the team.

232
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,112
It's not to be petulant
or sulk.

233
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,132
I understand that, coach.

234
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:45,697
But you're saying
if it wasn't for emma,

235
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,050
I would be cheer captain, right?

236
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,643
It's a moot point.

237
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:51,870
But that is what you said.

238
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:54,723
What I said is
if it weren't for emma,

239
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:58,802
We'd be having a different
conversation, maybe.

240
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,321
Thanks, coach.

241
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:01,989
Have a good day.

242
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,706
- Anna!
- Oh, mr. Olsen.

243
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,041
You scared me.

244
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,435
I'm sorry. I mean...

245
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,620
You were coming to see me,
weren't you?

246
00:13:58,714 --> 00:13:59,938
Yeah, oh, yeah.

247
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,456
And I think I know why.

248
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,128
I was actually gonna talk to you
about it in class tomorrow.

249
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,946
My quiz.

250
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,948
I'll do better, mr. Olsen.
I promise.

251
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,283
It's not about doing better.

252
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,635
I mean, this was just
our first quiz.

253
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,621
And if I may be blunt,

254
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,214
You demonstrated zero
understanding of the material.

255
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,234
It's just--
I just transferred here.

256
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:22,218
- I understand that.
- And at my other school,

257
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,630
I guess my calc class
wasn't as far along.

258
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:27,132
Maybe we think about starting
off in pre-calc again, you know?

259
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,410
- Just to give you a refresher.
- No!

260
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,136
I can't.

261
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:33,580
I really need this for college.

262
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:38,994
I don't know
what to say, anna.

263
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:42,089
I'll work harder, study more.
You know, whatever it takes.

264
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,817
If you say so, but you're on the
cheerleading squad, aren't you?

265
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:49,171
And I assume
that you know the rules.

266
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:52,157
The cheerleaders are required
to maintain a c-plus average

267
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:54,843
In all their academic courses
at all times.

268
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,920
And from what I know,

269
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,666
Coach johnson is a stickler
for the rules.

270
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:03,944
Like I said, I'll do better.

271
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:07,114
You weren't actually coming
to see me, were you?

272
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,025
I-I was! I was just

273
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,010
Dropping something off
for a friend first.

274
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:13,695
Now let's talk about
the vape pen.

275
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,014
Look, anna, you can either
give it to me now,

276
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,607
Or I can call
the school safety officer.

277
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:20,961
And believe me, he's a lot less
understanding than I am.

278
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,038
Please.

279
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,298
Come on.

280
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:34,624
You see, if you know the rules
academically,

281
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:37,719
Then you definitely know that
there is a zero tolerance policy

282
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,813
For nicotine products
on campus.

283
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,150
And you know the consequences?

284
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,818
Suspension.

285
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,902
What are you gonna do?

286
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,888
Look, it's Friday.

287
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:59,074
I'm not gonna do anything
right now.

288
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,743
I'm just gonna take some time
and think it over.

289
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:06,732
Please. I can't lose my spot
on the team.

290
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,417
I'll do anything.

291
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,179
I'm gonna think about it.

292
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,350
Have a nice weekend,
okay, anna?

293
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,759
I always knew I'd be dating

294
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:36,019
The captain
of the cheerleading squad.

295
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,946
I just didn't know
it'd be you.

296
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,447
- Shane!
- What?

297
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,524
What about you, kate?

298
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,710
There's plenty of guys on
the team I can set you up with.

299
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:45,270
Would you leave her alone?

300
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:49,216
What? It's senior year!
Live a little.

301
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:52,201
I'm sure if kate wants you
to set her up with someone,

302
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:53,720
She'll let you know.

303
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,707
Thanks, guys, it's okay.
I can handle myself.

304
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,301
Besides, shane, no offense,

305
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,879
I had my fill of the soccer team
with austin, remember?

306
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,473
That was forever ago.

307
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,552
Besides, austin was a meathead.
You need someone smart.

308
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,980
I don't think you're gonna
find that on this soccer team.

309
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,815
- No.

310
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,302
Let's talk about emma.
This is your moment of glory.

311
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:21,230
I gotta say, the whole
soccer team was pulling for you.

312
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,491
Either one of you, actually.

313
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,234
Oh, come on!
What does the soccer team care

314
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,736
Who makes head cheerleader?

315
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,740
We do care.
We notice these things.

316
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,075
Right.

317
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,743
I was a little nervous
at the end.

318
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:36,838
- Yeah, right!
- I'm serious!

319
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,157
I had a bad feeling
anna was gonna get it.

320
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,602
- Oh, my god.
- Who's anna?

321
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:44,104
New girl. She just
transferred here senior year.

322
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,939
She good?

323
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:47,274
Real good.

324
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,776
Maybe as good
as anyone on the team.

325
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,837
She a bitch?

326
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:54,097
You know I hate when
you use that word, shane.

327
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,598
What?

328
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,843
Well, is she?

329
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,678
No, not really.

330
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,680
It's actually
quite the opposite.

331
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,698
So what's wrong with her?

332
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:05,108
Nothing's wrong with her.

333
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:07,202
She just gives weird vibes.

334
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,871
She's like super sweet on
the surface, but underneath...

335
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,190
- Totally.
- She acted like she was

336
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:13,875
Super overjoyed
when I was named captain,

337
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,878
But in reality, I think she was
furious she didn't get it.

338
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,198
And luckily she didn't.
There would have been a mutiny.

339
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:23,535
See, everyone would have been
okay with cari or even skylar,

340
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:25,312
But definitely not her.

341
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,438
No way.

342
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:52,747
Hey, where's your better half?

343
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,157
Around here somewhere.

344
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,009
Don't take this the wrong way,

345
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,421
But I didn't expect to see
much of the two of you today.

346
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,258
Now that emma's captain,
she has reputation to uphold.

347
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, right, like that's
what's keeping you two

348
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,838
Out of the bedroom.

349
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,191
I don't understand why
we both can't be cheer captain.

350
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,860
- Hey, I was just kidding.
- No.

351
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,513
But like we're both
equally qualified.

352
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,199
Okay, but people voted for me.

353
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,276
I don't know how it worked
at your other school,

354
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,036
But we knew there's only
one cheer captain.

355
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,372
I'm sorry that this
hurt your feelings.

356
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:28,333
It's going to happen,
and I'm gonna make a change!

357
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:32,454
What do you think
that's about?

358
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,964
I have no idea.

359
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,467
Let's go see.
Make sure em's okay.

360
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,451
- Did you hear that?
- No, but we saw it.

361
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:47,802
- What's going on?
- Just forget it.

362
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,396
Come on, em, tell me.

363
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,898
Well, I approached her,
you know, just to be nice,

364
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,734
And I asked her
if she's having a good time,

365
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,885
And if she wanted me
to introduce her to anybody.

366
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,220
My little cheer captain.

367
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,907
Do you know what she
had the nerve to ask me?

368
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,468
She asked me if we can go
to coach johnson together

369
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,895
And ask her if we can be
co-cheer captains.

370
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,897
- No way.
- Yes.

371
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:11,142
She kept going on about how she
deserves to be cheer captain

372
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:13,828
And how she's the best one
on the team.

373
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,071
She said all that?

374
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:16,423
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

375
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:18,241
Look, just ignore her, em.

376
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:19,408
Don't even worry about it.

377
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,576
Yeah, don't worry about it.

378
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,837
I'll get you a drink.
Come on.

379
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,656
Come on, cheer up.

380
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,099
We're at a party.

381
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,510
We drink, we party.

382
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,335
I don't know. My counselor said
maybe I should be looking at

383
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:39,504
Some of those smaller schools
out east.

384
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:41,281
I don't think
I could go that far.

385
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:43,191
It's just my mom and me,
you know.

386
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:47,270
Yeah, but in my case, my family
is why I want to get away.

387
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:51,866
Hey, how is she?

388
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,852
Not good.

389
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,854
She's been drinking all day.

390
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:58,356
That conversation
really got to her.

391
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,950
- You want me to go talk to her?
- Nah.

392
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,618
I'm gonna get her some water,

393
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,121
And hopefully she feels better
when she sobers up.

394
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:06,622
- I hope so.
- All right.

395
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:07,790
Yeah.

396
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,559
I'll be back.

397
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,222
What was that about?

398
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,650
So anna, the new girl,

399
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,485
She approached emma
about something.

400
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,304
About what?

401
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,990
I don't want to gossip,
but anna--

402
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:26,901
 Kate, help!
I need your help!

403
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:29,663
Come in here! Help!

404
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,576
Kate, help!

405
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,002
Emma!

406
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,987
I came in, she was
on the floor just like this.

407
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:39,230
- Emma!
- She won't wake up.

408
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:42,342
Come on, wake up!
Call 911!

409
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,419
Emma!

410
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,088
Emma, wake up!

411
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,348
Em!

412
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,351
Em! Em, wake up!

413
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,847
- Oh, honey, I know, I know.

414
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,941
I'm so sorry.

415
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,853
I just, I just can't believe
that she's really gone.

416
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,706
Oh...

417
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:16,784
Sweetheart,
you can talk to me.

418
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,527
Did emma take something?

419
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:22,048
No, mom.
Emma didn't do drugs.

420
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:25,944
She was drinking,
but not that much.

421
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:27,536
Not enough to kill her.

422
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,723
See, that's the thing
with alcohol.

423
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,375
You kids think that
you're so indestructible,

424
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,044
But you never know how
your young bodies will react

425
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:36,971
To all that liquor.

426
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,807
I'm not in the mood
for a lecture, mom.

427
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,960
What we need to
take away from this is that--

428
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:45,146
What we need to take away?
God, mom!

429
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,132
My best friend
isn't even in the ground yet,

430
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:49,317
And you want to
make a lesson out of it!

431
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,412
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

432
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:57,250
Come here, you need a hug.

433
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:58,919
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,838
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,301
This is the hardest speech
that I've ever had to give.

436
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:11,231
We have to say goodbye
to one of our own.

437
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,900
Emma rogers epitomized

438
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:17,311
What one could want
in a cheerleader,

439
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:19,906
In a student athlete,

440
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:22,575
In a friend.

441
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,577
She was loyal,

442
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:25,728
Determined,

443
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,806
Kind.

444
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:31,993
In order to honor her memory,

445
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:36,589
We must all, every one of us,

446
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:39,150
Rededicate our lives

447
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:42,320
To the values
which emma exemplified.

448
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:48,101
In doing this,
her memory will live on forever.

449
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:53,331
On that note,
I hereby dedicate this season

450
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:56,091
To the memory of emma rogers.

451
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,502
To emma.

452
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,196
- To emma.
- To emma.

453
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,599
As I've said before,

454
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:08,103
Emma personified what it means
to be a cheer captain.

455
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:10,364
To fill that role,

456
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,125
I'm proud to announce,

457
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:15,128
As I am sure emma
would also be proud,

458
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,967
That your new cheer captain
is anna barton.

459
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,956
Look at her.
She can barely contain herself.

460
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,475
Yeah.

461
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:34,647
 Thanks for coming over.
I really needed a friend.

462
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,557
Shane: Did you go
to school today?

463
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,985
Yeah, only 'cause
my mom made me.

464
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:41,988
- You obviously didn't want to.
- Didn't want to?

465
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,807
Kate, I was with the police
all day.

466
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,826
The police? Why?

467
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,978
You didn't hear anything?
No rumors?

468
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:52,749
Nothing.
You know I'd tell you.

469
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,151
According to the cops,

470
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,913
They found honey in her system.

471
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,566
- Honey?
- Yeah.

472
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:03,734
It's slang for tetrobolin,

473
00:30:03,753 --> 00:30:06,495
An anabolic steroid
with a red color.

474
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,664
What does it do?

475
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,333
Well, if you take it long-term
in the proper amounts,

476
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:13,578
It builds muscle
like any other steroid.

477
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:18,173
But short-term,
it gets you high like ecstasy.

478
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,101
And they thought
that you gave it to her?

479
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:24,012
Not gave it to her.
Slipped it in her drink.

480
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:27,758
Why would they think-- oh!

481
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:32,113
Yeah. I'm never gonna
live it down.

482
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,356
But they believe you now, right?

483
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:38,619
I don't know if they believe me,
but they let me go.

484
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,214
My lawyer said they had to.
They had no proof to hold me.

485
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,774
Oh, my god.
Wait, you have a lawyer?

486
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,218
A friend of the family.

487
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,387
My parents called him
right away.

488
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:49,630
I don't think
it means anything.

489
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:52,450
Okay, but if you didn't do it,

490
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:55,803
And emma didn't
take the drugs herself,

491
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:59,882
Then who gave--
slipped it into her drink?

492
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:02,960
You have any ideas?

493
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:05,238
Let's get going.
I'll think about it.

494
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:12,412
Hey, mom.

495
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:15,139
Hey, kate. Where were you?

496
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:17,141
I was with shane.
I told you that.

497
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:20,144
Hmm, just riding around, huh?

498
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:22,422
We grabbed a bite to eat.

499
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:27,501
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

500
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,095
What's going on?

501
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:30,179
Sit.

502
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,010
Kate, I don't want you
seeing shane anymore.

503
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,995
Mom, he's like the only person

504
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,605
That understands
what I'm going through.

505
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,608
Nevertheless, I don't think
it's a good idea.

506
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,168
Where is this coming from?

507
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,595
- It's all over town, kate.
- What is?

508
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,264
That shane was the one
that slipped emma those drugs.

509
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,008
Even the police
have questioned him.

510
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:53,678
Exactly. They questioned him.

511
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,771
If there was any chance
that they thought he did it,

512
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,349
They wouldn't have let him go.

513
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:00,442
Let me ask you something.

514
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:03,370
What possible reason does
shane have for drugging emma?

515
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,207
Sweetheart,
I know you may think I'm naive,

516
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,209
But I know what they
use those drugs for.

517
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,786
I hate to tell you this, mom,

518
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,863
But shane didn't need
to drug emma.

519
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:14,474
And why would you say that?

520
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,051
Because they were together
for a long time.

521
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:18,978
She was more than happy
to sleep with him.

522
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,388
If anything,
she'd be drugging him.

523
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,316
Oh, that's enough.

524
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,635
What about his past?

525
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:29,471
- His past?
- The steroids.

526
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,157
Mom, that was for soccer.

527
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,050
Because of all the pressure
he had on him

528
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:34,827
To recover faster
from his shoulder injury.

529
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,238
Yeah, that's what he said.

530
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,573
Exactly! That's what he said.

531
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:42,484
He admitted it
and accepted his punishment.

532
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:44,337
That's a big deal to be
suspended for three games.

533
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:48,991
Look, mom,
someone killed emma.

534
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:51,660
- Kate...
- What?

535
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:54,347
Why would someone do that? Why?

536
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:56,182
Because they were
jealous of her.

537
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,519
Because they thought they should
have been picked as captain.

538
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,522
I hate to break this to you,
but you don't kill someone

539
00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:04,941
Because they beat you out
as cheerleading captain.

540
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,194
I have homework to do.

541
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,197
Kate.

542
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,943
I know you may not
agree with me,

543
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,370
But I meant what I said.

544
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:20,122
I want you to stop
seeing shane.

545
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,302
- Mr. Olsen.
- Hmm?

546
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,562
You've got a visitor.

547
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,063
Oh, thanks.

548
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:47,716
Mr. Olsen?

549
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,901
How can I help you?

550
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,736
I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

551
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:55,241
Like I said,
I didn't do anything.

552
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:58,393
But you understand we need
to investigate every complaint.

553
00:33:58,487 --> 00:33:59,745
What complaint?

554
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:01,488
That is confidential.

555
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:05,142
Okay, so anyone can come in here
with an anonymous complaint,

556
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:07,161
And there's nothing
that I can do about it?

557
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,755
Look, you know what?
It could have been...

558
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:13,408
It probably was some student
that's bitter about their grade.

559
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:18,931
You see, that is where
we have an issue, mr. Olsen.

560
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,104
Okay, what are these?

561
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:26,272
You tell me.

562
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,834
I have no idea.

563
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:31,836
All right,
then how about you tell me

564
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:33,854
Why they were found
on your computer?

565
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,781
What do you mean,
on my computer?

566
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:39,285
The police pulled them off
the server, mr. Olsen.

567
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,603
And that's what they found,
so far.

568
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,623
They were found
in a hidden folder,

569
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,182
But not so hidden
that our I.T. People

570
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:46,684
Couldn't find them right away.

571
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,276
Okay, just hang on a second.

572
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,371
You're telling me
you found these photos

573
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,539
On my school computer?

574
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:55,860
I mean, that doesn't even
make any sense.

575
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:57,361
If I did take these photos,

576
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:59,639
Why would I keep them
at school, huh?

577
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,806
Why, indeed.

578
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:04,385
I mean, how do you even know
who these girls are?

579
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,295
You can't, you can't even see
their faces in most of them.

580
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:09,398
They were identified
as cheerleaders.

581
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,486
Pine hills cheerleaders.

582
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,324
I want a lawyer.

583
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,493
You haven't even been
arrested yet.

584
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,903
Then I'm not saying
another word.

585
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:24,830
All right, well, in that case,

586
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,074
You have the right
to remain silent.

587
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,985
Come on, this is ridiculous!
I didn't take those pictures!

588
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,413
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

589
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:35,232
I'm telling you the truth, okay?
I was framed by somebody.

590
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:36,342
- By who?
- That new girl.

591
00:35:36,493 --> 00:35:38,402
- What new girl?
- Anna something.

592
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:39,845
Okay, let's go.

593
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:41,847
Come on, this is so...

594
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,023
Did you hear?

595
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,693
Hear what?
The latest rumor about em?

596
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,936
- No, about mr. Olsen.
- Mr. Olsen?

597
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,531
- They arrested him.
- Are you kidding me?

598
00:35:58,682 --> 00:36:01,683
I swear. Brittany saw him being
put into a cop car in handcuffs.

599
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,427
What'd he do?

600
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:06,188
He had pictures of girls.

601
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,948
Eww. Which girls?

602
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,935
I don't know, but rumor has it
it was cheerleaders.

603
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:12,937
Everyone always
joked about mr. Olsen.

604
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:15,697
I thought it was because he was
young and students liked him.

605
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,107
I know, right?

606
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:19,034
He never thought he was sus.

607
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,387
It turns out he wasn't just sus,
he was sick.

608
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:24,798
You guys talking about
mr. Olsen?

609
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:25,950
Yeah.

610
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,393
He hit on me, you know.

611
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:28,728
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:30,879
He told me
I could improve my grade,

613
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:32,806
And then he tried...
You know.

614
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,382
Gross.

615
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:36,569
See you guys at practice.

616
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:54,920
I'm sure that you've all
heard by now

617
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,923
That mr. Olsen
has been arrested.

618
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,742
Now I realize there are
a bunch of rumors,

619
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:03,429
But the only thing that I can
confirm at this point

620
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,508
Is that pictures have been
found in his possession.

621
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:11,678
Now, it's still too premature
to speculate,

622
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:13,831
But we have reason to believe

623
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:16,834
That some of the pictures
are of cheerleaders.

624
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:20,504
Now, if you have
any information

625
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:25,267
Or any experiences
with mr. Olsen,

626
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,361
Please speak up.

627
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:30,030
Over the next few days, we'll be
bringing in some counselors

628
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:31,957
If you need someone to talk to.

629
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:34,018
I have to go
to an admin meeting,

630
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:36,045
So I'm gonna leave things
in anna's hands.

631
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:40,374
Okay, everybody,
let's get going.

632
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:41,967
All right?

633
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,361
I know this is a lot
to take in,

634
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,214
So if you guys wanna talk after
practice, I'm here for you.

635
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,366
What are you
talking about, anna?

636
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:52,052
I'm just saying.
I know this can't be easy.

637
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:54,980
As captain, I'm here for you.

638
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,891
You're not really
captain, anna.

639
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,135
What do you mean?

640
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:02,488
You're only captain
because emma died.

641
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,549
- Nobody even voted for you.
- You don't mean that.

642
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:10,404
Look, anna, just start practice.
We can talk about this later.

643
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:13,499
Come on, ladies!
Let's get in formation, please!

644
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:17,503
Okay, ready, arms up.

645
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:19,897
Arms down, side, side.

646
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:22,916
Drill that in. Keep it going.
Keep it going, keep it going.

647
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,177
Let's get it together.

648
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,587
Why don't we do
the combination?

649
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:27,763
Up, down.

650
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,852
Come in.

651
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,338
You okay?

652
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,524
- Did you tell them?
- I did.

653
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:41,360
And what did you say?

654
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:44,697
I tried to keep it as vague
and as specific as possible.

655
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:46,940
I basically told them
that I'm here for them.

656
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:51,370
That's good, that's good.
How'd they take it?

657
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:53,947
Nothing surprises these kids
anymore, ellen.

658
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,541
They didn't hear it
from their parents.

659
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,284
They heard about it
from each other.

660
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,104
Yeah, but we have to make sure
that we are still the ones

661
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:02,548
Who appear to have
given them the news.

662
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,960
How well did you know
eric olsen?

663
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,113
I was assistant principal
when he was hired.

664
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:10,614
Got to know him
a little bit. Why?

665
00:39:10,707 --> 00:39:12,616
What'd you think about him?

666
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,134
Between us, off the record.

667
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,969
I thought he might be
the kind of teacher

668
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,563
That would get in trouble
with a young high school girl.

669
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,141
- What do you mean?
- Oh, don't be naive, coach.

670
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:23,051
Now, you know just what
I'm talking about.

671
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,388
He's young. He's good-looking.
The kids worship him.

672
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,073
So you're saying
he's the type.

673
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,484
I'm saying
where there's smoke...

674
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:33,654
No. I just don't buy it.

675
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,490
Why? Because you like him?
You think he's nice?

676
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:37,991
What did he say
when you found the photos,

677
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,326
When you confronted him?

678
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,478
He denied it, of course.

679
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:43,756
What did you think he was
gonna say, "you got me"?

680
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:47,501
I'm just saying
something doesn't feel right.

681
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,988
That's because it is
very, very, very wrong.

682
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,990
That's just what it is.

683
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,675
Let me ask you something now.

684
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,918
How did those pictures
get on his computer,

685
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:58,345
And who took them?

686
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:02,107
I-I don't know,
but who alerted the police?

687
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:04,092
An anonymous tip.
You know that.

688
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:06,853
And you don't find that
just a little bit suspicious?

689
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:10,616
Quite frankly, you know what
I find a more suspicious, coach?

690
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,693
Your inability
to accept the facts.

691
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,846
I will accept the facts, ellen,

692
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:17,848
But I've been doing this
a long time,

693
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:20,017
Nearly as long as you have.

694
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:23,854
It's not about protecting
a friend or colleague.

695
00:40:23,947 --> 00:40:26,281
Something about this
isn't right.

696
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,950
Well, until you find out
what that is,

697
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,861
We have to let the police
do their job.

698
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:34,047
Now, we have a responsibility
to our students, their parents,

699
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,558
And to the community.

700
00:40:57,314 --> 00:40:58,998
- come in.

701
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,242
I'm going out.

702
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:05,078
Now? You have school tomorrow.

703
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,080
I know. I won't be long.

704
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,233
I just need fresh air.

705
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:11,493
Maybe I'll go get
something to eat.

706
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,420
But we just had dinner
a few hours ago.

707
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,255
God, mom!

708
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:17,332
Can't I do anything without
getting the third degree?

709
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:19,852
You act like I'm some juvenile
delinquent or something.

710
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,187
I'm acting like
you're my daughter.

711
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:24,414
Believe me,
I'm sure miss rogers

712
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,525
Wishes she kept
a closer eye on emma.

713
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:27,751
How can you say that?

714
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,253
I'm sorry.

715
00:41:29,346 --> 00:41:32,364
I don't mean to be harsh,
but it's true.

716
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,951
No. What's true is that
someone killed her.

717
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:39,705
You're going out with shane,
aren't you?

718
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:41,022
And if I am?

719
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,042
You know how I feel about that.

720
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,211
And what about next year
when I'm gone?

721
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:48,530
You'll have no say over
who I go out with then.

722
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:52,033
Please, kate.
I don't want to argue.

723
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,887
Yeah? Neither do I.

724
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,385
You been waiting long?

725
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,053
Nah, not really.

726
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:13,647
I'm surprised your mom
let you come.

727
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,649
She didn't. I just left.

728
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:19,636
Ooh! Look at you,
breaking the law.

729
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:22,973
Okay, so what's so important you
couldn't tell me on the phone?

730
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:25,918
- You're not gonna believe me.
- Try me.

731
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:29,737
Okay, I think the new girl,
anna barton, poisoned emma.

732
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,757
I'm sure of it.

733
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,759
You don't think I'm crazy,
do you?

734
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:36,503
Look, both of us know

735
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:38,580
That emma would have never
taken those drugs on her own,

736
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:40,248
So someone gave it to her.

737
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:42,434
It wasn't me.
It wasn't you.

738
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,511
I don't think it was
any of our friends,

739
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,939
So what's a better explanation?

740
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:51,184
Unfortunately, you can't just
go around accusing her.

741
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:52,778
No one will believe you.

742
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:54,780
What if I have proof?

743
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:57,357
Talk to me.

744
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,100
So before I came here,

745
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,361
I spent some time on my phone
googling anna barton.

746
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:02,937
And?

747
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:07,534
Nothing. Not one single mention
of our anna barton.

748
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:12,022
Okay, that's strange,
but that's not exactly proof.

749
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:13,707
That's more than strange, shane.

750
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,300
Do you know how unlikely it is

751
00:43:15,452 --> 00:43:18,028
For someone our age
to have no online presence?

752
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:21,198
None! No social media accounts,
nothing.

753
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,976
It's like she never existed.

754
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:26,036
But she does exist.

755
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:28,388
Unfortunately, we all know that
way too well.

756
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:30,315
Unless...

757
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:32,542
Unless what?

758
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:35,303
I have an idea,
but I'm gonna need your help.

759
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:37,322
I'm all ears.

760
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:48,241
Hey.

761
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:49,409
Hey.

762
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:51,486
You're anna, right?

763
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,154
- Shane.
- I know.

764
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:54,247
Everybody knows.

765
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,750
Yeah, well, that's what happens

766
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,327
When you've lived here
all your life, not like you.

767
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:02,239
Yeah, my dad's job
forces us to move around a lot.

768
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:03,573
Where did you live
before this?

769
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,760
Weren't you emma's boyfriend?

770
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:09,504
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

771
00:44:09,598 --> 00:44:12,357
I don't know. It's kinda weird
that you're talking to me.

772
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:14,584
Why?

773
00:44:14,678 --> 00:44:17,029
Because I took emma's place.

774
00:44:17,256 --> 00:44:19,531
Yeah, well, you had
nothing to do with that.

775
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,107
That's true.

776
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,352
Look, I knew emma really well,
obviously,

777
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:26,947
And I think she'd be happy
you replaced her as captain.

778
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,782
- Really?
- Sure.

779
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:32,269
I've been watching you.
You're amazing.

780
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:34,696
Emma would've liked that.
She always respected talent.

781
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,290
Thank you. That actually...

782
00:44:37,443 --> 00:44:38,884
Actually means a lot.

783
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:43,222
So, um, I should get going.

784
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,449
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

785
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:47,451
Not a lot of people know
what I'm going through,

786
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:50,804
And, uh, I just thought
because you're new...

787
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:52,898
I could be
a shoulder to cry on.

788
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:58,311
I wouldn't put it like that.
I'd say... A friend.

789
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,313
My place after school?

790
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:01,573
Sure.

791
00:45:01,725 --> 00:45:03,575
I'll see you later.

792
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:21,260
Hey, mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

793
00:45:21,411 --> 00:45:23,845
Sure, honey. Sit down.

794
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:29,826
So what's going on?

795
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:32,420
I need a favor.

796
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:34,164
Okay.

797
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:37,334
I need you to use
some of your firm's resources.

798
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:40,353
You know the database
that you have access to?

799
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:43,115
And find me information
on anna barton.

800
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,674
For what reason?

801
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:46,510
Just background information.

802
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:49,288
Kate, even if that wasn't
a breach of protocol,

803
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,514
Which it is,

804
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:52,440
And if it wasn't unethical,

805
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,959
Which it also is,

806
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,537
I cannot keep feeding
these delusions of yours.

807
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,613
So that's a no?

808
00:45:58,707 --> 00:46:02,208
Honey, you have to let this go.

809
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:04,469
Emma's death was an accident.

810
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,454
Either she took
too much of a drug,

811
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,532
Or it was given to her
by shane.

812
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:09,883
Okay, stop! Just stop, mom!

813
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:12,385
You can believe
whatever you want to believe,

814
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,980
But I'm not gonna let you
tarnish her memory like that!

815
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:16,873
Okay.

816
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:18,650
How about seeing dr. Gordon?

817
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:21,987
He helped
when your father left.

818
00:46:22,138 --> 00:46:24,548
Remember what a bad place
you were in back then?

819
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:25,807
I don't need reminding, mom.

820
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,384
I'm just saying.

821
00:46:27,402 --> 00:46:28,902
We never thought that you
would get through that,

822
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:30,403
And look what happened.

823
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:32,405
I don't need a therapist.

824
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:34,666
I need someone
with access to information.

825
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:38,319
And just what are you
planning on doing with it?

826
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:42,399
I'm not sure,
but anna is not right.

827
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:45,068
I mean, she has
no social media presence, mom.

828
00:46:45,087 --> 00:46:46,845
It's like she appeared
out of thin air.

829
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:48,755
Maybe she's just
a private person.

830
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,256
How about that?

831
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:53,018
- And maybe she's a killer.
- You know what?

832
00:46:53,169 --> 00:46:55,078
I'm not gonna do this
with you.

833
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,263
If you are not willing
to help yourself,

834
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,340
Then there's not much more
that I can do,

835
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:01,008
But I refuse...

836
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:04,029
I refuse to indulge you
about this.

837
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:05,447
No.

838
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,934
I know I have to decide soon.

839
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:20,379
I just don't know
which way I'm leaning.

840
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,881
Not that my parents or coaches
want to hear that, but...

841
00:47:23,032 --> 00:47:24,716
I just can't imagine

842
00:47:24,868 --> 00:47:26,960
Suddenly giving something up
you've been doing all your life.

843
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:30,296
Well, not if I'm gonna be
a pro soccer player.

844
00:47:30,391 --> 00:47:32,557
Yeah, but don't you wanna
play it for as long as possible?

845
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:35,452
But it's not gonna be playing
at some big-time college.

846
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:36,803
I'm playing division three.

847
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,288
What's that mean?

848
00:47:38,306 --> 00:47:40,290
It means you take
the crowds at our games

849
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:41,883
And decrease them by 50%.

850
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:44,310
- Really?
- Yep.

851
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:45,962
Plus you still have
to practice every day,

852
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:47,572
You have to work out
in the off-season,

853
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:49,074
You have to stay in shape.

854
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:50,483
I just don't know
if I'm up for that.

855
00:47:50,636 --> 00:47:52,244
I guess I can see that.

856
00:47:52,471 --> 00:47:54,487
Enough about
the fading soccer star

857
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,973
In the twilight of his career.

858
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:58,158
What about you?

859
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,751
What about me?

860
00:47:59,903 --> 00:48:01,253
Where are you looking?

861
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:04,423
It all depends.

862
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,166
On?

863
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,593
On which school offers me
the most money.

864
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:12,580
My parents, they didn't put
a lot away for my education.

865
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,008
My mom, she always expected me
to get a scholarship.

866
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:16,751
Academic?

867
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,603
Cheerleading.

868
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,588
Really?

869
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,682
Yup. That's how
she went to college.

870
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:24,776
Growing up,
I was always expected to win

871
00:48:24,928 --> 00:48:27,779
At every cheer contest
I was in.

872
00:48:27,931 --> 00:48:30,449
If I didn't, well...

873
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:32,534
If I didn't,
there were consequences.

874
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:37,180
You could always
just take out loans.

875
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:38,940
True, but the last thing I want
when I graduate

876
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:41,184
Is to be saddled with
thousands of dollars in debt.

877
00:48:41,203 --> 00:48:43,128
Yeah, that makes sense.

878
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:46,965
So you said you moved around
a lot because your dad's work.

879
00:48:47,116 --> 00:48:48,191
What does he do?

880
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,193
He's in the oil business.

881
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:51,970
As a rig worker though,
not an executive.

882
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:55,456
Oh, cool.
Where did you move from?

883
00:48:55,476 --> 00:48:58,384
you sure ask a lot of questions.

884
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,870
Actually, anna, I've been told
I don't ask enough.

885
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:04,040
No, no. It's just
you wouldn't know it.

886
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:05,984
It's a small town
near kansas city.

887
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:08,135
Kansas city?

888
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:10,137
They got some
good steaks there, huh?

889
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,240
I don't know.

890
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:16,052
I-I don't eat meat.

891
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:19,480
Oh. Well, I do,
and I'm getting hungry.

892
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,501
Do you wanna get
a bite to eat?

893
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:23,910
What?

894
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,172
Nothing. It's just...

895
00:49:27,323 --> 00:49:30,157
You're being
really nice to me.

896
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:31,735
I'm a nice guy.

897
00:49:31,828 --> 00:49:34,754
Yeah, yeah, you are, but...

898
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:35,755
But...

899
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:38,683
I told you. It's just...

900
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,185
Come on!

901
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:42,687
Anna, you take being captain
seriously, right?

902
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:45,673
- Of course.
- Well, emma did too.

903
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:48,527
And I know she'd be happy
that I'm treating you this way.

904
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,949
Come on, don't overthink it.
Let's go get a bite to eat.

905
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:23,812
Let's sit down.

906
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,476
What the hell
were you doing anyways?

907
00:50:30,629 --> 00:50:31,736
You almost broke my window.

908
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:33,738
Trying to get your attention.
What else?

909
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,741
You couldn't have called or
texted like a normal person?

910
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:39,744
I didn't want your mom to hear
or get suspicious.

911
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:43,582
And she wouldn't be
if my window suddenly shattered?

912
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:44,749
Good point.

913
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:46,918
Sorry.

914
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,479
So how's it going?

915
00:50:49,497 --> 00:50:51,423
It's going good, actually.

916
00:50:51,574 --> 00:50:53,592
You don't think
she suspects anything, do you?

917
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,986
Suspects anything?
Not a chance.

918
00:50:57,005 --> 00:51:00,599
Did she say anything?
You know, about her past?

919
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,084
She said she came
from kansas city,

920
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:05,845
Or rather a small town
near there.

921
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:08,756
Figures.
That's hard to check on.

922
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:11,759
- But I don't think she did.
- Why?

923
00:51:11,853 --> 00:51:14,112
I don't know. I just have
a strange feeling about it.

924
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:17,857
Something's bothering you
about this. What is it?

925
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:20,176
She's a little strange, but...

926
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:21,694
But what?

927
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:24,438
I don't get the sense
that she could kill someone.

928
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,942
You don't? Oh, what, suddenly
you're psychiatrist now?

929
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,369
What are you
getting all mad about?

930
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:30,462
I'm not!

931
00:51:31,857 --> 00:51:33,114
I'm not.

932
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:36,468
I just know that
she's responsible, shane.

933
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:39,471
Look, the idea was for me
to gather information about her,

934
00:51:39,698 --> 00:51:42,641
Not psychoanalyze her,
and I'm doing that.

935
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:46,645
So please,
let it play out, okay?

936
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:47,962
Sorry.

937
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:50,649
Hey, this is painful
for everyone.

938
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,150
We all loved emma.

939
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:06,890
Hey, kate, come on in.

940
00:52:06,983 --> 00:52:09,409
Hey, coach, you got a sec?

941
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:11,561
Of course. What's going on?

942
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:14,005
I wanted to talk to you
about anna.

943
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:16,007
- Oh?
- Yeah.

944
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:18,176
In fact, I wanted to ask you
to reconsider.

945
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,069
Reconsider?

946
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:22,138
Your decision
on making her captain.

947
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:27,093
A lot of girls
aren't happy about it.

948
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,928
A lot of girls or you?

949
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,022
What's that supposed to mean?

950
00:52:31,174 --> 00:52:34,693
Look, kate, I know that
emma was your best friend.

951
00:52:34,844 --> 00:52:36,695
Of course
it's gonna feel natural

952
00:52:36,922 --> 00:52:39,847
For you to feel protective
for who takes her place.

953
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,533
It has nothing at all
to do with this.

954
00:52:41,684 --> 00:52:45,094
- And you're sure.
- Yes. The problem is anna.

955
00:52:45,113 --> 00:52:47,430
Okay, well, then
I'm gonna need specifics.

956
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:50,283
I don't have specifics.
I just have...

957
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,711
I just have a feeling.

958
00:52:52,862 --> 00:52:56,272
This isn't easy, kate.
I know that.

959
00:52:56,365 --> 00:52:58,365
But I hope that you
trust me enough to believe

960
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,626
That I'm gonna do what I think
is right for the team.

961
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:02,278
Okay?

962
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,304
Mm-hmm.

963
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,398
Thanks for giving me
a ride home.

964
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:15,625
It's so annoying,
but my dad's car is in the shop,

965
00:53:15,643 --> 00:53:17,718
So he had to borrow mine.

966
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:20,739
Not a problem.
I'm happy to do it.

967
00:53:20,966 --> 00:53:23,700
By the way,
he's still at work.

968
00:53:25,653 --> 00:53:26,745
My mom too.

969
00:53:28,397 --> 00:53:29,581
Want to come in?

970
00:53:32,494 --> 00:53:34,419
Um, okay.

971
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:45,671
I like your room.

972
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:47,766
It's okay, I guess.

973
00:53:56,835 --> 00:53:58,926
- Um...
- What?

974
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,671
I, um...

975
00:54:01,764 --> 00:54:03,865
can I have a glass of water?

976
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,077
Sure.

977
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:32,477
Lombard?

978
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,613
Thank you.

979
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:58,394
I'm sorry, anna.

980
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:01,414
This...
This is moving too fast.

981
00:55:01,508 --> 00:55:04,175
- What is?
- This.

982
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:06,469
Us. It's too soon.

983
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,740
- You don't even like me?
- Of course I like you.

984
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:14,352
But that's not the point.
It's not okay.

985
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:15,836
It's not fair to emma.

986
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,005
Wouldn't emma
want you to be happy?

987
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:20,341
I'm sorry, I...

988
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,860
I can't.

989
00:55:26,091 --> 00:55:27,031
Shane!

990
00:56:16,565 --> 00:56:18,583
Hey, mom, what are you doing,
dressed like that?

991
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:21,327
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I gotta go to the office today.

992
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,070
- On the weekend?
- Yeah.

993
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,148
Last-minute update
with this case.

994
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:28,151
Mr. Mcmichaels needs me there
the entire time.

995
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:29,260
Oh.

996
00:56:29,412 --> 00:56:31,003
You gonna be okay?

997
00:56:31,156 --> 00:56:32,488
Yeah, I'll be fine.

998
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:34,432
I've got tons
of studying to do,

999
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,768
Plus a few girls were talking
about going to the movies.

1000
00:56:36,919 --> 00:56:39,178
Oh, sounds fun.
Need some cash?

1001
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,255
Nope. I got plenty.
Thanks, mom.

1002
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:43,924
- Okay. Gotta go. Bye.
- Bye.

1003
00:56:43,944 --> 00:56:46,611
- Love you.
- Love you too.

1004
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,438
Yeah, she just left.

1005
00:56:57,457 --> 00:56:59,865
I know,
faster than I thought.

1006
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,085
Give me about 20 minutes
and then pick me up.

1007
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:09,283
You know how to get there?

1008
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,711
Not a clue.
That's why I have waze.

1009
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:14,788
I just don't want it
to be a waste of time.

1010
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:16,215
Why would it be
a waste of time?

1011
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:18,142
I saw that lombard t-shirt
in her drawer.

1012
00:57:18,294 --> 00:57:20,979
I didn't mean it like that.
I meant like a wild goose chase.

1013
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:23,222
Anna could've had
that lombard high t-shirt

1014
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:25,391
For a million different reasons.

1015
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:26,392
Like?

1016
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:27,877
Like an old boyfriend's.

1017
00:57:27,895 --> 00:57:29,988
She just moved here
from kansas city.

1018
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:31,063
Or a gift.

1019
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:32,882
Who gives somebody a t-shirt

1020
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,567
From a random high school?

1021
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:37,978
And it just happens to be from
the place you just moved to?

1022
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:40,239
Okay, fair point.

1023
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,908
By the way,
I'm sorry about the other day.

1024
00:57:43,003 --> 00:57:45,561
- The other day?
- When I was short with you

1025
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,231
For saying that
anna didn't seem dangerous.

1026
00:57:48,324 --> 00:57:49,340
It's okay.

1027
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:51,175
I was just worried.

1028
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:52,902
About...

1029
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,404
She's wonderful
at manipulating people, shane.

1030
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:57,240
I seen her do it to coach.

1031
00:57:57,258 --> 00:57:58,924
I just don't want her
to take advantage of you

1032
00:57:59,077 --> 00:58:00,518
Without you even knowing it.

1033
00:58:00,669 --> 00:58:02,854
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of myself.

1034
00:58:03,005 --> 00:58:04,747
Believe it or not,

1035
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,191
I'm a pretty good judge
of character.

1036
00:58:16,852 --> 00:58:19,787
- It's so ill.
- I'd never tell.

1037
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:22,948
- Let me do the talking.
- Why?

1038
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:24,784
So...

1039
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:27,270
A random guy coming up to them,
asking weird questions?

1040
00:58:27,288 --> 00:58:29,363
They're gonna think
you're hitting on them.

1041
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:32,199
- Fine. You do the talking.
- I will.

1042
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:34,385
I'll just stand here
and look pretty.

1043
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,226
I'd never.

1044
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:43,636
Excuse me.

1045
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,878
Yeah?

1046
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:46,564
Do you guys go
to lombard high?

1047
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:49,233
Maybe.

1048
00:58:49,385 --> 00:58:51,811
My name is kate taylor.
I'm a cheerleader at pine hills.

1049
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:53,979
- Good for you.

1050
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:56,491
Do you know anna barton?

1051
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,412
What about her?

1052
00:59:01,564 --> 00:59:02,914
So you do know her.

1053
00:59:03,065 --> 00:59:03,989
Why do you want to know?

1054
00:59:04,142 --> 00:59:06,084
She used to go to school
with us.

1055
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:08,994
- Used to?
- Yeah. She was a cheerleader.

1056
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:10,663
What happened to her?

1057
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,738
She moved away.

1058
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:12,924
And that's all?

1059
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:14,741
That's all you know?

1060
00:59:14,761 --> 00:59:16,427
Why are you asking us
these questions?

1061
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:18,579
Look, she's going
to our high school now,

1062
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,431
And she might have
hurt some people.

1063
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:23,008
So if you know anything
about her, please tell us.

1064
00:59:23,103 --> 00:59:25,661
Hurt them how?

1065
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,938
Killed them.

1066
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,778
Please!

1067
00:59:33,929 --> 00:59:35,947
Look, if I were you,

1068
00:59:36,098 --> 00:59:38,449
I'd stay far away
from anna barton.

1069
00:59:40,345 --> 00:59:42,703
I promise you,
it's in your best interests.

1070
00:59:51,522 --> 00:59:52,872
So what do you think?

1071
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:55,541
I think we need
to find out more about anna.

1072
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:57,026
I agree.

1073
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,546
I thought you said
she has no social presence.

1074
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:03,532
She doesn't.
I'm looking up something else.

1075
01:00:03,626 --> 01:00:06,369
Something happened
at lombard high,

1076
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:08,220
Something that made anna
transfer.

1077
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:10,130
Why do you think that?

1078
01:00:10,224 --> 01:00:13,985
Did you see the way those girls
reacted when we said her name?

1079
01:00:18,474 --> 01:00:20,065
Come on, what is it?

1080
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,951
One sec.

1081
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:25,496
Oh, my god!

1082
01:00:25,648 --> 01:00:29,742
Anna's best friend died,
and she found the body.

1083
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,486
<i> "last year, a cheerleader</i>
<i> from lombard high...</i>

1084
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:35,173
- Thanks.
<i> - Named susie jacobs died,</i>

1085
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,750
And the body was found
by her best friend."

1086
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:39,510
I bet that was anna.

1087
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:41,995
But if anna killed her,
the police would be all over it.

1088
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:46,517
Not really. I don't think
the authorities suspect her.

1089
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:49,261
They think susie jacobs
committed suicide.

1090
01:00:49,414 --> 01:00:50,913
Why do you think that?

1091
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:52,190
Because when there's
no cause of death,

1092
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:54,250
That's normally
the reason why.

1093
01:00:54,268 --> 01:00:56,510
You know, out of respect
for the victim and the family.

1094
01:00:56,604 --> 01:00:58,345
If any foul play
was suspected,

1095
01:00:58,439 --> 01:01:00,681
It would've been
in that article.

1096
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,259
Okay, that makes sense,
I guess.

1097
01:01:03,277 --> 01:01:05,686
But if that was the case,
why did anna move away?

1098
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,430
Don't you see?
She killed her

1099
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:09,207
And pretended she had
nothing to do with it.

1100
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:11,191
If your best friend died
and you found the body,

1101
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:13,285
You'd be pretty messed up too.

1102
01:01:13,438 --> 01:01:17,531
And you could sell the fact
that they needed a fresh start.

1103
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,009
It could all seem
so understandable.

1104
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:26,799
That was great, mom.
Thank you.

1105
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:29,727
See? Your mom can whip up
something when she has to.

1106
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:32,396
- Right.
- Kidding.

1107
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:37,460
I really do wish I had more time
to cook for you.

1108
01:01:37,553 --> 01:01:39,904
Mom, we can eat anywhere,
or I can cook.

1109
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:42,648
The work that you do
is really important.

1110
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,741
Thanks, sweetheart.

1111
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,562
You know, I've been
so busy with work

1112
01:01:48,656 --> 01:01:51,657
That I haven't had a chance
to say how are you doing.

1113
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:55,644
Okay, I guess.
I feel better when I'm busy.

1114
01:01:55,663 --> 01:01:58,071
That's natural and healthy.

1115
01:01:58,165 --> 01:02:01,092
Yeah. That's why me and--

1116
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:03,410
That's why I still haven't
stopped trying

1117
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,412
To figure out
what happened to emma.

1118
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:08,432
You know exactly
what happened to her.

1119
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:12,270
Mom, there is something
not right with anna, trust me.

1120
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:15,514
Then why aren't the authorities
looking into it, hmm?

1121
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:17,257
Because they don't want to.

1122
01:02:17,277 --> 01:02:19,944
Because it's easier to accept
easy solutions instead.

1123
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:22,187
I love you,

1124
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:25,265
But you are going to drive
yourself crazy with this.

1125
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,119
I'm going to bed.
Good night.

1126
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:48,217
Mom!

1127
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,163
<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

1128
01:05:01,256 --> 01:05:02,857
someone's in my house.

1129
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:48,060
Kate?

1130
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:49,403
Hey.

1131
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:53,157
It's okay.

1132
01:05:53,308 --> 01:05:55,384
It's okay.

1133
01:05:58,313 --> 01:06:01,481
Look, miss taylor,
I know you're tired,

1134
01:06:01,575 --> 01:06:04,743
But it's really important that
we run it one more time, okay?

1135
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:06,895
I already told you
what happened.

1136
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:09,155
I know, I know,
and you did a great job,

1137
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:10,841
But sometimes
when we do it again,

1138
01:06:10,993 --> 01:06:13,511
We think of things that
we didn't remember before, okay?

1139
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:18,182
Just a few more questions.
Okay? Please.

1140
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,925
Thank you.

1141
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:21,519
So just to be clear,

1142
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,355
At no time did you see
anyone else inside of the home,

1143
01:06:24,506 --> 01:06:26,840
Except for your mother,
correct?

1144
01:06:26,859 --> 01:06:29,585
yes, that's correct.

1145
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:31,754
Okay, then what makes you
100% certain

1146
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:33,939
That someone else
was in the home?

1147
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,425
Because I heard them.
I heard their footsteps.

1148
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:39,094
Couldn't that
have been your mother?

1149
01:06:39,113 --> 01:06:41,613
No, because when I went
to check on her,

1150
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:42,706
She was fast asleep.

1151
01:06:45,286 --> 01:06:48,771
Kate, sometimes we think
we may have heard

1152
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:50,881
Or seen something
that we really didn't.

1153
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,384
I didn't imagine this, if that's
what you're trying to say.

1154
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:55,035
No, no, not imagine,

1155
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:57,629
But sometimes when I'm awakened
from a deep sleep,

1156
01:06:57,782 --> 01:06:59,890
It takes me a while
to get my bearings.

1157
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:03,802
Mm-mm, no.
I know what I heard.

1158
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:07,790
Fair enough, but, um...
What makes you so certain

1159
01:07:07,808 --> 01:07:12,477
It was this classmate of yours,
anna barton?

1160
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,405
Who else could it have been?

1161
01:07:17,151 --> 01:07:18,725
I mean...

1162
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:23,247
Kate, we didn't find any sign
of a break-in. None.

1163
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,974
Can't you at least just ask her?
See what she says.

1164
01:07:25,993 --> 01:07:27,976
This isn't much to go on.

1165
01:07:27,995 --> 01:07:29,903
It's gonna be too late!

1166
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:33,239
Detective,
let's stop for tonight.

1167
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:36,318
Kate could use some sleep.
We'll finish up tomorrow.

1168
01:07:36,411 --> 01:07:37,428
Thank you.

1169
01:07:38,598 --> 01:07:39,763
Okay.

1170
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,557
I'll see myself out.

1171
01:07:45,754 --> 01:07:47,187
- I believe you.

1172
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,166
Whose side are you on anyways?

1173
01:07:51,259 --> 01:07:53,944
I'm on your side, kate, always.
You know that.

1174
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:57,263
Yeah, well, you're starting to
sound like my mom and the cops.

1175
01:07:57,283 --> 01:07:58,932
They didn't believe me either.

1176
01:07:58,951 --> 01:08:00,784
Of course I believe you.

1177
01:08:00,936 --> 01:08:02,102
I just don't understand
why anna

1178
01:08:02,196 --> 01:08:03,937
Would want to
break into your house.

1179
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:07,516
Isn't it obvious? To do to me
what she did to emma,

1180
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:10,535
To mr. Olsen,
and to susie jacobs.

1181
01:08:10,688 --> 01:08:12,187
Maybe susie jacobs.

1182
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:14,781
I just don't want you
jumping to any conclusions here.

1183
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,635
Fine. Just wait.
You'll see.

1184
01:08:17,786 --> 01:08:19,285
You think
we should call first?

1185
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:22,139
No, because if she says no,
we're screwed.

1186
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:24,383
She can still slam the door
in our face, kate.

1187
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:26,477
True, but that's harder to do

1188
01:08:26,628 --> 01:08:28,053
If we're standing
in front of her.

1189
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:30,389
And if she's not home?

1190
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,874
In all the articles I read,

1191
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:34,226
I feel like
the family has money.

1192
01:08:34,378 --> 01:08:37,446
The dad has like a good job.
He's the ceo of some company.

1193
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:40,399
The mom can still work, kate.

1194
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:41,975
Okay, they were out of luck.

1195
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,477
But I have a feeling.

1196
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:45,913
Come on, let's go.

1197
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:54,004
This it?

1198
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,298
It is. 967.

1199
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:07,685
Yes? Can I help you?

1200
01:09:07,836 --> 01:09:09,687
Mrs. Jacobs?

1201
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:13,598
Hi, I'm kate taylor,
and this is my friend shane.

1202
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:15,526
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

1203
01:09:15,753 --> 01:09:17,602
What is this about?

1204
01:09:17,697 --> 01:09:19,196
Your daughter.

1205
01:09:19,423 --> 01:09:22,015
My daughter's dead.

1206
01:09:22,034 --> 01:09:24,535
Yes, ma'am, and I'm so sorry,

1207
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:26,611
But my best friend is too,

1208
01:09:26,764 --> 01:09:29,998
And I think that anna barton
had something to do with it.

1209
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:37,697
- Here you go.
- Thank you, mrs. Jacobs.

1210
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,341
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1211
01:09:42,054 --> 01:09:47,799
So what is it that you wanted
to ask me about anna barton?

1212
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:50,118
If it's not too hard,

1213
01:09:50,137 --> 01:09:52,563
What role did she play
in susie's death?

1214
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,882
She found her body.

1215
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,551
I'm so sorry.

1216
01:09:58,645 --> 01:10:00,796
Do you mind if I ask
how susie died?

1217
01:10:00,889 --> 01:10:04,557
I'm sure you've read
the articles.

1218
01:10:04,577 --> 01:10:06,243
 They didn't say.

1219
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:10,322
Well, according to the police
and the medical examiner,

1220
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:13,308
My daughter took her own life.

1221
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:15,586
You don't believe that, do you?

1222
01:10:17,815 --> 01:10:19,923
And what happened
when anna found her body?

1223
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:24,261
It happened at anna's house.

1224
01:10:24,412 --> 01:10:27,155
By the time that I got there,
susie had already passed,

1225
01:10:27,249 --> 01:10:29,057
And they'd taken anna away.

1226
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,602
What do you mean, taken away?

1227
01:10:31,753 --> 01:10:34,354
I assumed
that you already knew.

1228
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:40,519
After anna found the body,
she had a nervous breakdown

1229
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:46,099
Or whatever the correct
medical term is for it.

1230
01:10:46,193 --> 01:10:49,435
She was institutionalized
for almost a year and a half,

1231
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:51,789
And that was the last time
I saw her.

1232
01:10:52,016 --> 01:10:53,773
Why?

1233
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:55,626
She moved away.

1234
01:10:55,777 --> 01:10:59,779
Her parents thought that
she needed another environment.

1235
01:10:59,799 --> 01:11:04,117
I'd lost my daughter.
I didn't much care.

1236
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:08,697
Mrs. Jacobs, that girl
has just moved into our town

1237
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,142
And like I just want
to make sure.

1238
01:11:15,722 --> 01:11:18,148
You know, it's strange.

1239
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,151
After all that girl has
supposedly been through,

1240
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:24,804
She still has
that same shy smile.

1241
01:11:24,898 --> 01:11:29,067
Don't take this the wrong way,
but when you say "supposedly..."

1242
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,721
Susie and anna were friends.
There is no question about that,

1243
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:37,242
But I always felt like anna's
reaction to my daughter's death

1244
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:38,910
Was just a little...

1245
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:40,486
Theatrical?

1246
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:42,005
Manufactured.

1247
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:45,325
This sounds awful to say,

1248
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,903
But anna always seemed like
the kind of girl

1249
01:11:47,921 --> 01:11:52,665
That said what she
wanted you to hear,

1250
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:54,926
But not what she actually felt.

1251
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:57,095
But I can't really blame her

1252
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,172
When you have parents
like what she had.

1253
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:01,583
Parents?

1254
01:12:01,602 --> 01:12:05,178
Her mother always put her under
a tremendous amount of pressure.

1255
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:07,823
If she didn't live up to her...

1256
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:14,096
Let's just say that
we had very different ideas

1257
01:12:14,114 --> 01:12:15,855
Of how to parent a child.

1258
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,040
Was she abusive?

1259
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:23,029
As I said, we just had
very different ideas.

1260
01:12:23,123 --> 01:12:27,109
And, mrs. Jacobs, I know this is
a very personal question,

1261
01:12:27,202 --> 01:12:29,778
But do you know
the kind of drug

1262
01:12:29,796 --> 01:12:32,038
That's responsible
for susie's death?

1263
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:34,633
Something that athletes take.

1264
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:36,894
The police weren't surprised.

1265
01:12:37,045 --> 01:12:40,122
They said that it was something
that cheerleaders used

1266
01:12:40,215 --> 01:12:42,307
To help them perform better.

1267
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:46,645
I can't recall
the actual name, but it...

1268
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:50,315
It's the sound
of something like... Sugar.

1269
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:51,325
Honey.

1270
01:12:52,486 --> 01:12:55,470
That's it. Honey.

1271
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:57,414
I can't believe it.
Did you hear that?

1272
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:59,416
I heard it, I heard.

1273
01:12:59,567 --> 01:13:02,235
- I just don't know if--
- what?

1274
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:05,497
It's gonna be enough information
to convince the police.

1275
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:06,423
Are you kidding me?

1276
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:08,333
It's a common drug.

1277
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:10,485
You know how many people on
the team experimented with it?

1278
01:13:10,504 --> 01:13:12,003
They just weren't caught.

1279
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,765
How many people we know
take it at parties?

1280
01:13:14,992 --> 01:13:17,250
True, but if it
just so happened to involve

1281
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:19,937
Two deaths of the people
that she knew...

1282
01:13:20,088 --> 01:13:23,756
People commit suicide.
They o.D.

1283
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,667
Could just be
a tragic coincidence.

1284
01:13:25,686 --> 01:13:27,502
I agree with you. I do.

1285
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:30,338
It's very suspicious, but...

1286
01:13:30,357 --> 01:13:32,265
The police may need
something more.

1287
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:34,117
Then you need
to get it for them.

1288
01:13:34,269 --> 01:13:37,179
Kate, I've done everything
you've asked, but...

1289
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:38,346
But what?

1290
01:13:38,365 --> 01:13:40,532
I'm not a real detective.

1291
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:42,775
I think we just should leave it
up to the authorities now.

1292
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:46,279
The authorities don't care
about emma, not like we do.

1293
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:48,298
We owe it to her.
You owe it to her.

1294
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,800
Okay, okay.

1295
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:52,861
What do you want me to do?

1296
01:13:52,879 --> 01:13:55,788
I want you to get her to admit
what she did. What else?

1297
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:59,142
come on, kate!

1298
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:00,978
Don't be ridiculous.

1299
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:05,107
I'm not. I know that
you can be very persuasive.

1300
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:11,563
It's totally gross.
That's all I'm saying.

1301
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:13,732
Shane, he should be
ashamed of himself,

1302
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:15,383
Like really ashamed.

1303
01:14:15,402 --> 01:14:17,235
Come on, cari,
we don't know the whole story.

1304
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:19,312
- There might be more to it.
- What's to know?

1305
01:14:19,406 --> 01:14:21,072
I see them together
all the time now.

1306
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,058
If I were you, I'd be pissed.

1307
01:14:23,076 --> 01:14:25,577
Look, it's really
none of my business.

1308
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:28,563
And like I said, there might be
more to it than you know.

1309
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:30,749
Come on, guys,
let's get to work, okay?

1310
01:14:30,843 --> 01:14:32,567
Shut up, anna.

1311
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:34,236
What did you say?

1312
01:14:34,254 --> 01:14:37,072
I said shut up.

1313
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:38,998
Watch it, kate.

1314
01:14:39,092 --> 01:14:41,593
Or what, you'll make sure
I end up like susie jacobs?

1315
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:42,927
Guys, stop.

1316
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,746
How dare you bring that up.

1317
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:46,839
- Don't touch me, anna.
- I just touched you.

1318
01:14:46,933 --> 01:14:48,250
You're not even
supposed to be here!

1319
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:50,343
Go back to where
you came from!

1320
01:14:50,437 --> 01:14:52,512
- I'm captain!
- You're not captain!

1321
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:53,938
Yes, I am! How dare you!

1322
01:14:54,091 --> 01:14:55,681
enough!

1323
01:14:55,701 --> 01:14:57,759
- Go home!
- I said stop it!

1324
01:14:57,852 --> 01:14:59,369
- She started it!
- You lying bitch!

1325
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:00,612
Enough!

1326
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:03,707
My office, both of you! Now!

1327
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:07,169
Back to practice.

1328
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:12,941
- oh, my god.

1329
01:15:13,034 --> 01:15:16,111
I am very disappointed
in you both.

1330
01:15:16,129 --> 01:15:18,630
This is not the way
that a captain behaves,

1331
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:20,632
Nor is it what I would expect

1332
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:23,285
From one of the most senior
members on the squad.

1333
01:15:23,378 --> 01:15:25,303
Now tell me what happened.

1334
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:27,213
- one at a time.

1335
01:15:27,307 --> 01:15:29,733
Anna, go ahead.

1336
01:15:29,884 --> 01:15:31,309
She attacked me
for no reason.

1337
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:32,477
You're a liar.

1338
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:34,479
Kate, you'll have your turn.

1339
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:38,133
Ever since I became captain,
she's wanted to sabotage me.

1340
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,911
I'm sorry her best friend died,
I really am,

1341
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:43,488
But that's no excuse
for how she's treated me.

1342
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,974
She didn't die.
You killed her.

1343
01:15:45,992 --> 01:15:49,661
Anna, please go
and start practice.

1344
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,663
I need some time
to speak with miss taylor.

1345
01:15:51,815 --> 01:15:53,815
But all she's gonna do
is tell you a ton of lies,

1346
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:55,575
And I won't be here
to defend myself.

1347
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,844
Anna, please.

1348
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,102
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1349
01:16:05,253 --> 01:16:07,938
Accusing her of murder?
Come on, kate!

1350
01:16:08,089 --> 01:16:10,607
Coach johnson, you don't know
what I've discovered about her.

1351
01:16:10,758 --> 01:16:12,091
I know that you've
had it out for anna

1352
01:16:12,185 --> 01:16:14,169
Ever since she was named
cheer captain.

1353
01:16:14,262 --> 01:16:15,928
I also know
that you have no basis

1354
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:18,264
For your previous accusations
against her.

1355
01:16:18,358 --> 01:16:22,177
Kate, I want to help you,
I really do.

1356
01:16:22,195 --> 01:16:23,862
I want you to go talk
to mrs. Simon

1357
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:26,030
Or one of the other
school social workers.

1358
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,125
I don't need a shrink, coach.

1359
01:16:28,276 --> 01:16:31,461
With all due respect, kate,
I think that you do.

1360
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:35,799
At the very least, she can
help you manage your emotions.

1361
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,285
My emotions aren't the problem.
Anna barton is!

1362
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:42,547
Okay, let me say this
a different way.

1363
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,790
You will go talk to someone,

1364
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:47,144
Or I will remove you
from the team.

1365
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:53,466
Coach, you've known me
for a long time.

1366
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,487
Have you ever known me
to make something like this up?

1367
01:16:57,714 --> 01:17:00,657
To act irrationally?

1368
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:03,401
I'm begging you,
keep an eye on anna.

1369
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:05,220
She did it.

1370
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:06,913
I know she did.

1371
01:17:12,396 --> 01:17:14,078
Gather round, gather round.

1372
01:17:14,231 --> 01:17:16,731
As you are all aware,

1373
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:20,510
There was a minor altercation
before practice.

1374
01:17:20,662 --> 01:17:24,848
I've spoken to both parties
to express my displeasure.

1375
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:28,593
Suffice it to say,
it won't happen again.

1376
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:31,930
Sometimes
in situations like these,

1377
01:17:32,024 --> 01:17:34,933
I think it's best
for the coach to step aside

1378
01:17:35,027 --> 01:17:38,102
And let you work it out
amongst yourselves.

1379
01:17:38,255 --> 01:17:40,363
I'll be in my office.

1380
01:17:42,868 --> 01:17:45,351
Some of you saw what happened.

1381
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,370
The rest of you heard.

1382
01:17:47,597 --> 01:17:50,207
So, kate...

1383
01:18:04,297 --> 01:18:05,722
- Coach?

1384
01:18:05,873 --> 01:18:07,465
Mr. Olsen,
what are you doing here?

1385
01:18:07,617 --> 01:18:09,951
- I need to speak with you.
- You can't be here.

1386
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:12,062
Just hear me out
for one second, please.

1387
01:18:12,213 --> 01:18:13,638
I could get fired.

1388
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:15,214
If you don't listen to me
about anna barton,

1389
01:18:15,234 --> 01:18:17,049
Something worse could happen.

1390
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:19,903
I never touched
any student. Ever.

1391
01:18:20,054 --> 01:18:22,572
I never took any pictures.

1392
01:18:22,724 --> 01:18:24,741
You believe me, don't you?

1393
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:31,155
That's okay
'cause that doesn't matter.

1394
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:34,233
What matters is that
you believe emma rogers.

1395
01:18:34,327 --> 01:18:36,144
We both knew her.

1396
01:18:36,162 --> 01:18:38,904
She didn't use drugs,
and I also knew her boyfriend.

1397
01:18:38,999 --> 01:18:40,164
And despite
what some people think,

1398
01:18:40,317 --> 01:18:42,834
He wouldn't have
given them to her.

1399
01:18:42,986 --> 01:18:44,427
You think anna did?

1400
01:18:44,654 --> 01:18:47,005
Look, I caught her vaping
on school property.

1401
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:48,932
That's why I believe
that she framed me.

1402
01:18:59,519 --> 01:19:01,736
Anna barton is dangerous.

1403
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:40,875
Trust me, you're gonna hear
all about it.

1404
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:42,635
Don't sweat it.

1405
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:44,712
A fight breaks out at soccer
practice like every other day.

1406
01:19:44,731 --> 01:19:46,972
Yeah but this was your
good old-fashioned cat fight,

1407
01:19:46,992 --> 01:19:49,492
The one that everybody loves.

1408
01:19:49,644 --> 01:19:51,477
And she apologized to you
in front of everyone?

1409
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:53,813
Yeah, only because
coach made her.

1410
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:56,148
It was so fake,
like everything about her.

1411
01:19:56,242 --> 01:19:57,483
Where is she now?

1412
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:59,502
I don't know.
Gone home, I guess.

1413
01:19:59,654 --> 01:20:02,655
No. Her car is still here.

1414
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:03,748
Hmm...

1415
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:06,009
Okay, I gotta get going.

1416
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:07,844
Okay, I'll see you.

1417
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:09,253
Where are you going?

1418
01:20:09,406 --> 01:20:11,497
Um, gonna go
check on something.

1419
01:20:11,591 --> 01:20:12,849
Do you want me
to wait for you?

1420
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
No. I'll see you tomorrow.

1421
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,144
Okay.

1422
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:32,443
Anna, what are you
doing here?

1423
01:20:32,596 --> 01:20:34,037
Where'd you get that?

1424
01:20:34,188 --> 01:20:36,355
Your backpack
was on school property.

1425
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:38,691
If we have any suspicion
of illegal activity,

1426
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,543
We have every right
to search it.

1427
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:42,453
Then you suspect me
of doing something illegal?

1428
01:20:42,606 --> 01:20:45,106
I don't know, anna.
You tell me.

1429
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:50,202
It would've been so much easier,
coach johnson,

1430
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:52,371
It would've been
so much easier

1431
01:20:52,391 --> 01:20:54,782
If you just named me
cheer captain.

1432
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:56,451
We went over this already.

1433
01:20:56,469 --> 01:20:59,062
All these girls,
especially emma,

1434
01:20:59,213 --> 01:21:01,231
They just had everything
handed to them.

1435
01:21:01,382 --> 01:21:03,382
No, you know that
that's not true.

1436
01:21:03,402 --> 01:21:05,793
They never had
a mother like mine.

1437
01:21:05,887 --> 01:21:08,479
Is that what this is about?

1438
01:21:08,632 --> 01:21:10,632
Why you moved here
to pine hills?

1439
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,300
Because of your mother?

1440
01:21:12,318 --> 01:21:15,153
Don't pretend like you
suddenly care, coach johnson.

1441
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:16,988
I do care, anna.

1442
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,915
I really wanna help you.

1443
01:21:19,066 --> 01:21:21,826
I'm afraid it's a little bit
too late for that.

1444
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:24,162
Did you kill emma, anna?

1445
01:21:24,314 --> 01:21:26,089
Did you poison her?

1446
01:21:35,175 --> 01:21:38,009
I'm gonna kill you, kate,

1447
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:39,602
Just like I killed emma.

1448
01:21:39,754 --> 01:21:41,271
Like hell you are.

1449
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:26,708
Coach! Coach!

1450
01:22:26,726 --> 01:22:28,067
Coach, wake up.

1451
01:22:40,573 --> 01:22:42,582
- wake up.

1452
01:22:56,163 --> 01:22:59,498
Mmm! Now, that is
a fine cup of coffee.

1453
01:22:59,592 --> 01:23:00,908
Thank you, mrs. Taylor.

1454
01:23:00,927 --> 01:23:03,186
You're welcome.
I'm sure the coffee

1455
01:23:03,413 --> 01:23:05,913
Isn't the reason
you stopped by, detective.

1456
01:23:05,932 --> 01:23:09,526
No, no, it is not. Um...

1457
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:12,529
I've spoken to the police
department in lombard,

1458
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,698
And they're looking back
at susie jacob's death.

1459
01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:18,109
I've also spoken with
susie jacob's mother,

1460
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:20,444
And she said that none of this
would have been possible,

1461
01:23:20,597 --> 01:23:23,188
- If it wasn't for you.
- Mm-hmm.

1462
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,708
We're also re-interviewing
everyone from the party

1463
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,211
At which emma rogers
overdosed.

1464
01:23:28,362 --> 01:23:30,788
Now that we know
who's responsible,

1465
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:33,550
We're hoping that someone will
come forward with something.

1466
01:23:33,777 --> 01:23:36,535
- And coach johnson?
- She's fine.

1467
01:23:36,555 --> 01:23:39,222
She has a nice scar,
but no permanent damage.

1468
01:23:39,449 --> 01:23:42,541
She's very grateful
for you too, obviously.

1469
01:23:42,561 --> 01:23:45,119
Well, one thing's for certain.

1470
01:23:45,138 --> 01:23:48,314
She definitely picked
the wrong cheer captain.

1471
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,627
Detective, all of this
that you're telling us

1472
01:23:52,645 --> 01:23:54,462
Is nothing that
we don't already know.

1473
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,150
Anna barton woke up last night
from her medically induced coma.

1474
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:00,968
And?

1475
01:24:00,987 --> 01:24:04,972
And we've had her under
constant observation since,

1476
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:08,585
But she claims
she doesn't remember anything.
