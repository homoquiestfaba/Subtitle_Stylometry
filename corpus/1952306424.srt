1
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:29,863
The year was 2081, and everyone was finally equal. 

2
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,736
They weren't only equal before God and the law, you see. 

3
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,804
They were equal every which way.

4
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,807
Nobody was smarter than anybody else. 

5
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,777
Nobody was better looking than anybody else. 

6
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,215
Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else.

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,491
And all this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, 
and 213th Amendments to the Constitution,

8
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:03,263
and to the unceasing vigilance of the 
United States Handicapper General.

9
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,302
The strong wear weights to make them weaker, 

10
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:13,707
the intelligent wear earpieces that kept them
from taking unfair advantage of their brains.

11
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:20,314
Even the beautiful sometimes wear masks in situations
where the beauty might simply be... too distracting.

12
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,751
It was the golden age... of equality. 

13
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,523
Some things about living still weren't quite right, though.

14
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,662
April for instance, continue to drive people 
crazy by not quite being springtime.

15
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:44,471
And it was in that clammy month that the H-G men came
to take George and Hazel Bergeron's son, Harrison, away. 

16
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,394
You were fixing the tv, dear.

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,594
I bet that was a real pretty dance, that dance she just did.

18
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,397
Huh?

19
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,533
That dance. I bet it was nice.

20
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,747
Wow, how was it this time?

21
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,218
Loud. Same as last time.

22
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:44,157
Sounded a little like somebody hitting a milk
bottle with a ball peen hammer, from here.

23
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,732
Not it must be real interesting, to hear all the 
different sounds. All the things they think up.

24
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,966
It isn't.

25
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,502
Only, if I was Handicapper General, you know what I'd do? 

26
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,640
I'd have chimes on Sunday. Just chimes. 
Kinda, kinda, in honor of religion.

27
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,110
Yeah, I could think straight, if it was just chimes

28
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:10,484
Well then maybe i'd make'em real loud, then. 
I think I'd make a good Handicapper General.

29
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,688
You would.

30
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,682
Pfff. Boy! That one was a doozy, wasn't it?

31
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,953
Yeah.

32
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,860
You seem distracted, hon'. What are you thinking about?

33
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,096
I don't know.

34
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:05,906
Can't... it's straight in my head, but... something

35
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:14,047
You must be tired. Why don't you stretch out on the sofa,
so you can rest your handicaps on the pillows

36
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,215
I'm fine.

37
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,686
You're always so worn out. If there was
 just some way we could light'em....

38
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,121
There isn't.

39
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,393
I'm not saying all the time, i'm just saying
maybe when you're siting around the house

40
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:37,337
Hazel. If I take them off. I'm gonna wanna keep them off. 
And we both know how we would feel about that.

41
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,374
We'd hate it.

42
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,880
So, nothing to be done then.

43
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:58,825
We interrupt our broadcast of the national ballet
sleeping beauty for important breaking news.

44
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:04,865
Ah, Now I don't understand why they interrupt such 
a nice ballet just to tell us the same old news.

45
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,735
What does it matter if they're just showing the same old ballet.

46
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:30,156
Good evening. We've just received
a warning from the handicap...

47
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:45,438
That's all right, he tried. That's the important thing. 
I think he should get a nice big raise for trying so hard.

48
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,418
Well, i think I'll get started with the dishes.

49
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,441
Good Evening. 

50
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,445
We've just received a warning from the 
office of the handicapper general, 

51
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,617
that: suspected anarchist, Harrison Bergeron, 
has escaped from custody. 

52
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,721
Arrested six years ago for propaganda's vandalism,

53
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:40,571
broadcast piracy, refusal to report for his
quarterly handicapping evaluations, 

54
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,597
and for the blading removal of his handicaps on a public place. 

55
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,301
Mr. Bergeron had been awaiting trial 
on a maximal securation prison, 

56
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:55,075
here on washington DC, when he miraculously 
disappeared from his cell, earlier this evening. 

57
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,713
Please be adviced that Bergeron is a genius and an athlete,

58
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:05,719
is under-handicapped, and is considered
to be extremely dangerous.

59
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:18,565
If you see this man please contact your 
local authorities immediately. Thank you.

60
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,039
Harrison...

61
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,106
Quiet.

62
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,576
Ladies and gentlemen.

63
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:43,149
Distinguished guests from around the world, 
may i have your attention, please. 

64
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:59,099
There is a bomb beneath this theater 
and there is a detonator in my hand. 

65
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:07,207
So, i strongly suggest that you remain in your seats. 

66
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,961
Now, my apologies for interrupting
this evening's entertainment.

67
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,697
Hopely i can provide you with some of my own. 

68
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,068
My name is Harrison Bergeron. 

69
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,905
I'm a fugitive and a public threat. 

70
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,308
I'm a abomination of the able. 

71
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,612
I'm an exception  to the excepted. 

72
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,084
I'm the greatest man you have never known. 

73
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,956
And for the last six years i've been held prisoner by the state. 

74
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:04,097
Sentenced without trial to torture without end. 

75
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:16,743
They had hope to destroy in me 
any trace of the extraordinary. 

76
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,147
And in time i came to share that hope. 

77
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:30,957
But the extraordinary, it seems, is simply out of their reach. 

78
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:45,705
So now i stand before you today beaten,
hobbled and sickened, but sadly not broken. 

79
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:51,044
And i say to you, that if it is greatness we'd must destroy 

80
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:57,951
than let us drag our enemy out of the 
darkness where it's been hiding. 

81
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:05,692
Let us shine a light so there, at last, all the world can see.

82
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,868
Copy that. Unit what your status

83
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:34,180
Stand by. We'll need a little more time

84
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,690
And now, for my next trick, i'm gonna need a volunteer. 

85
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,997
No one, come now.

86
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,702
Perhaps one of you.

87
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,142
Music.

88
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:23,756
Unit, the bomb has been disarmed. 
Repeat, the bomb has been disarmed.

89
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,560
Copy that. Central, kill the broadcast.

90
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,420
Enough.

91
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,857
Just you.

92
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,878
This is central, confirmed the 
broadcast cut. You're clear to proceed.

93
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,850
Copy that. All units... stand by for entry.

94
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,281
That one sounded kind-a-like a gun shot. 

95
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,161
Hon', you look upset, what is wrong?

96
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,702
I don't know.

97
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:24,610
Something ... sad ... on television... I think.

98
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,950
Oh, well... you should forget sad things, anyway. 

99
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,586
I always do. 

100
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,577
Gee I could tell that one was a doozy.

101
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,448
You can say that again?

102
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,023
Gee I could tell that one was a doozy.
