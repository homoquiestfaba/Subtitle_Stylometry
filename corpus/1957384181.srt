1
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Deployment orders.

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Origin: Titan moon base and
Cryo interment facility.

3
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
Destination: Cape Canaveral AFS Earth.

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Escort transport of
insurrectionist Python Diamond

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
for sentencing proceedings
before the court

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
of supreme justice.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Be advised that the prisoner has a history

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
of violent behavior.

9
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,600
So that's Python Diamond.

10
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Doesn't look so dangerous to me.

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,000
Nobody looks
dangerous and conscious, rookie.

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Shuttle's ready for departure, sir.

13
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
We just need our cargo.

14
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
How was he?

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Vitals are stable and he started to show

16
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,600
increasing neurofunctions.

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,200
He should be back with us momentarily.

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
That's a pity.

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
I still don't like this.

20
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
Excuse me?

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,800
After all we went through
to capture this man,

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,400
after how many soldiers
killed, after Baltimore

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
we're shipping him back to Earth?

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Be on ice 'till the sun burns up.

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
It's not your call, Uxbridge.

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Order was for five years.

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
No less by some miraculous circumstance.

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
You got your communications
geared back up and running.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,000
I haven't heard differently.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Now once you're in closer
the shuttle comm unit

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
should work.

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Just make sure you send up
some parts on the resupply.

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Godspeed.

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Oh, welcome back, Diamond.

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Why won't my legs move?

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Five years in Cryo could take its toll.

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, hey captain, good to see you again.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,400
It's major.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
Really?

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Congratulations.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
Load him up.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Wait.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm glad you remember Major Uxbridge here

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,000
'cause he's gonna be overseeing
your trip back to Earth

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
for sentencing.

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't wait.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,600
And of a personal note, Diamond,

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm glad to see you go.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Cryo was too good for you.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
No, I wanna watch your life tick away

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,200
in the confines of a cell.

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
You lash out all you want, Diamond.

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
You've got four months.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,800
Four months to watch Earth get closer,

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,600
four months to watch your last
seconds of sunlight dwindle.

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
And if you're very
lucky, you might not have

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
an accident on the way.

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,400
I have a hunch my
luck won't be that good.

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Believe it!

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Major Uxbridge!

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
Sorry, sir!

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
No need to apologize.

64
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
I didn't see anything.

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Anybody else see anything Major Uxbridge

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
need to apologize for?

67
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
No, sir.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Not me.

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
I can't say I did, general.

70
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
You see, no need to apologize.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Now get this man off my moon.

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,400
All right, you heard the general,

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
load him up and move him out.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Absolutely.

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,200
Scott, enjoy your vacation.

77
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll see you in 16 months.

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, I hear they've got a
great fettuccini Alfredo

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,800
where you're going, enjoy.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you, sir.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Got any three's?

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Go fish.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Eight.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Fuck you, lieutenant!

85
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
Even this flight's not that long, kid.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Oh honey, please.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Edwards, where's the major?

88
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,200
He's in the back with Diamond.

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
You want to disturb them, it's your call.

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Right.

91
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Maybe you should come take
a look at this instead.

92
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,400
For a man with your
mouth, you don't say much.

93
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, if you ask better questions.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,400
Seriously, you don't get bored of this?

95
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,800
And every day the last week
you're just throwing that left

96
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
like it's gonna change something.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I need to know what's
your insurgent buddies

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,800
have plan for our return!

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Whatever useful
information is in your head

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
is coming out one way or another.

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,400
And is it hitting me in
the head counterproductive?

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,800
What if you give me a
concussion I forget something?

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Yeah, that's much better.

104
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,800
We caught those comrades
of yours, you know.

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Most of them tried to resist arrest.

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,600
So if you have some idea that
all you have to do is last

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
until your compatriots can break you out

108
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,800
now that you're Earth
bound again, too bad.

109
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
If you had all of them, you wouldn't

110
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,600
be asking me questions.

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
Look, Scott, do you mind
if I call you Scott?

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,600
Look, Scott, it's been fun this whole

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
punch-me-taunt-you
thing that we have going

114
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
but I'm getting bored.

115
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,800
So either you find yourself new questions

116
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,200
or you don't get another word, all right?

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Major.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,200
You made contact with control?

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Not exactly.

120
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
You need to see this.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
What is it, Drake?

122
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,800
Take a look at this, sir.

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
That's impossible.

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That explains the silence.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
No lights.

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
Anywhere on the planet?

127
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,000
They have in view.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
The scanners can't reach the far side.

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Still nothing.

130
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,200
I mean that's--

131
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Impossible, yes.

132
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
We need to get closer.

133
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
Glass, I want you to stay here
and monitor the situation.

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Edwards, Drake with me.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
No, I don't wanna go school time, mom.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Yeah, rise and shine, buttercup.

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,800
We got trouble.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,200
It appears we are returning to a world

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
somewhat unlike what we left.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Between communications blackout

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
and the lack of any major power readings

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
I have to presume that a catastrophe

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,600
of unparalleled proportion
struck while we were in transit.

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
The nature of which is uncertain.

145
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,200
What we need to do now
is an atmospheric pass.

146
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Scan for anything that might give us clues

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
or lead us to people.

148
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Wait, we left and the world died?

149
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
So it would seem.

150
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Well, shit!

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
I told you I was important, serg.

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,000
This isn't a joke, Quinn.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,400
Gather your gear and
give it a combat check.

154
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,600
We could have boots on the ground

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
20 minutes after aero braking.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Yes, lieutenant.

157
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,600
Sir, what about the con?

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
Something's wrong.

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Yes, no communications.

161
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,000
And even stranger there's
no power signatures

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
over the Western Hemisphere.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
We'll be making combat recon
after our initial flyby,

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
get some hands on intel.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,600
We is an interesting choice of words.

166
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,000
We're on the move the
second we touch down.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,600
I don't wanna spare a single
soldier guarding you here.

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,200
You help us with this, maybe
I put in a word for you.

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Which means what,
that they won't kill me?

170
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
Or that they will?

171
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,600
You want a single solitary comfort

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,000
for the rest of your days?

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,800
This is your only chance, convict.

174
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay, I'll be right behind you.

175
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
Do I get a gun?

176
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
The only guns you get to
see will be at your back.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
You're taking point.

178
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,800
Well, that's a lucky
gift towards in the mouth

179
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
but that sounds shitty.

180
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
What else you got?

181
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
You've infiltrated places
we thought were unbreakable.

182
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
You saying you lost your nerve?

183
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Melting the walls of the Silver Cape

184
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,800
to spring political dissidents
was a public service

185
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
and well worth the effort.

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
This?

187
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
Between the soldiers you slaughtered

188
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,600
and the innocents in
Baltimore you're lucky

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm not solving my problems
by splattering the walls

190
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,800
of this cell with your brain.

191
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,000
That's option B.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
That is option B.

193
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Why didn't you say so?

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's go see how fucked up the world is.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Pretty fucked up, sir.

196
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Structural damage is heavy.

197
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,400
We've got multiple airstrikes against

198
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,000
most major metropolitan areas.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,400
And there's fires burning
in forests across the globe.

200
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
This is insane.

201
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Yeah, well that's not all.

202
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Sensors are showing doses of
radiation in the atmosphere.

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,800
I mean nothing at dangerous levels,

204
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
but it's pretty widespread.

205
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,200
It's what I'd expect of the
aftermath of a nuclear fallout.

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
You call me a sociopath
and you all nuked the planet?

207
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,000
But the levels are safe.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
On the Western Hemisphere.

209
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
On the Eastern Hemisphere,
I'd be surprised

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
if cockroaches didn't have five heads.

211
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,400
So that only leaves a
question of where we search.

212
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Even at this close we're not getting

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
any serious energy signatures.

214
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,200
I mean most of it could
easily be incidental readings,

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,400
but there's definitely
a couple major hotspots.

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Course for the closest
and we'll take a look.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Okay, we'll be there in five minutes.

218
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,400
All right people, check your packs.

219
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Travel light but any
protective gear we're wearing.

220
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,800
No knowing what we're
running to down there.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,400
All right then, don't talk.

222
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Boss, boss!

223
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Hey, boss, boss!

224
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
What is it?

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,000
You better come see, Gazeebo.

226
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Look!

227
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Well, fuck my monkey.

228
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
That's a military shuttle.

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Rag, Tag, get the boys together.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,200
We're hunting nine jockeys tonight.

231
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Whoo-hee!

232
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Instruments indicated the
power signature subterranean.

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
It must be a basement of some kind.

234
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
A fallout shelter?

235
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Not a lot of cover
coming towards the doors.

236
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
We aren't using the door.

237
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Why not?

238
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
Because you watch a door

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
and trap a door.

240
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
We don't know who's in there.

241
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
We don't give them the first move.

242
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,200
It's the ingress that
allows its field to fire.

243
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Let us use five guns effectively.

244
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Against how many of theirs?

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
Concentrating on your force is great,

246
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,200
knowing where to
concentrate them is better.

247
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
The shuttle's locked up tight, sir.

248
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,200
No ones getting in without the key codes.

249
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
How are we doing this?

250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,400
We aren't, I am.

251
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Give me a flash bang and a cutter.

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
I'll bust their home when
they aren't expecting,

253
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,600
scatter around, get the
door open when it's safe.

254
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
Major?

255
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Get us in.

256
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,000
If you make me regret my
choice, I can always shoot you.

257
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Not in the chest though, progress.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,200
Quinn, follow him.

259
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Keep an eye on him.

260
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,400
If he tries anything shoot him.

261
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Yes, sir.

262
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Quinn.

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Sir?

264
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
In the head.

265
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Permission to speak freely, sir?

266
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
Of course, Edwards.

267
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
Is this really a good idea?

268
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,000
You have your doubts?

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Frankly, sir, I don't
know what use he'll be.

270
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,000
He's no soldier, he's just a terrorist.

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Sometimes you forget you all joined up

272
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,600
since the rebellion was broken.

273
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
You've never seen him in action.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,400
You've never found his
insurgence waiting for you

275
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,600
inside secure facilities.

276
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
You never had the gem cutters rise up

277
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,400
from the ground itself like ghosts.

278
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,800
He's a superb asset, but
a lousy excuse for a man.

279
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
Do I trust him?

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Never.

281
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,000
But as long as we've landed
on a world we don't recognize

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I will make use of him.

283
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
He's good at this.

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
It's what he does.

285
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,000
And make no mistake, if
he endangers any of us

286
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
I will put a bullet between his eyes.

287
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
I might just do it for the satisfaction

288
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
once we figure out what
the hell happened here.

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Major!

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
Move, move!

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Hey everyone, say hello to Wren.

292
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Wren, this is Scott but he
likes to be called Admiral--

293
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,000
What the hell are you doing?

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Getting myself a gun.

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,200
You said you aren't gonna give me one.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Wren here was nice enough
to oblige me though.

297
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Weren't you, Wren?

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,600
Yes, Jesus fuck, yes.

299
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey, Scott, watch this.

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,400
Wren, how many people are downstairs?

301
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,000
There's nine, no, wait, I'm up here

302
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
so that means there's eight
down here, eight people.

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,800
I swear to God.

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,600
That's how you interrogate.

305
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,000
Wren, kindly show us the way downstairs?

306
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,600
Okay.

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I gotta admit, that was pretty slick.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
He's just getting started.

309
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Any traps, Wren?

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
Thank you.

311
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
You've been very helpful.

312
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
I don't like this, it's too confined.

313
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,800
It's the only way down and
we wanna talk to these people.

314
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
So this is the only way down, right?

315
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
See, only way.

316
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Unless you got shovels in a couple of days

317
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,600
or a mow machine.

318
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,400
You don't have one of those, right?

319
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,800
The only way you're
getting a molecular excavator

320
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
is over my dead body, Diamond.

321
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, Scott, don't be so formal.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Just call me Python.

323
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Python?

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Python Diamond?

325
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,200
You're him, you're the, wow!

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,800
Just wow.

327
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Always nice to meet a fan.

328
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
I hope you know what you're doing.

329
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
He knows what he's doing.

330
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,200
And if he doesn't, he's first in line,

331
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,800
him getting shot give
us plenty of warning.

332
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
It's a goddamn maze down here.

333
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
And you're sure you
know where you're going?

334
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh yeah, these tunnels
run on the whole complex

335
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
but I know 'em like the back of my hand.

336
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,600
Been here about four months now.

337
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
You gotta find your privacy.

338
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,600
So, Wren, what are we
gonna find behind the door?

339
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Just like I said, there's nine of us.

340
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,400
With the folks, my wife,
sister's lab and all.

341
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
It's tight.

342
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Kathy's been trying to make it nice.

343
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
No one's got their own room or anything

344
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,200
but it's okay, we're kind of a cozy bunch.

345
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
Oh, you sure got friendly in a hurry.

346
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,400
It's not every day
you meet a genuine hero.

347
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,200
Wren, is there some chance
that they knew we were coming?

348
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Yeah, we saw you... upstairs.

349
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,000
That's why I went up in the first place--

350
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Okay, okay, that's
really the sort of thing

351
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,800
you need to mention earlier.

352
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,400
Drake, Quinn, grenades around the corner

353
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,800
No, give me a flash bang!

354
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,600
Not on your life.

355
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Fuck it!

356
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Quinn!

357
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Eyes!

358
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,200
You should put that thing
down before you get hurt.

359
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Clear!

360
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,800
Hey Josh.

361
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,600
Hey Wren.

362
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,200
Josh huh, nice to meet you.

363
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,200
I just got here from Saturn.

364
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Take me to your leader.

365
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,400
Well, you already
met Josh and Ryan here.

366
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,000
This here is my wife
Kathy and her sister Lucy.

367
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Good afternoon.

368
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
And that's Vic and Gwen over there and,

369
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
don't mind them, they're a little sullen

370
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
since the world ended and there's no more

371
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,600
that they've never had to do without.

372
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Somewhere behind that curtain there is--

373
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Michael Thurber, star
of stage and screen.

374
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Mayhaps you've heard of me.

375
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No.

376
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,800
I played Willie Thauman, Richard III,

377
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
Reb Tevye...

378
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Maybe you saw "The Night
the Japs Attacked".

379
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Can't say that I have.

380
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,400
Well, he was very good in it.

381
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Yes, he was.

382
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Kathy, honey, this is, I'm sorry.

383
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
Major Uxbridge, ma'am.

384
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
Lieutenant Edwards, Sergeant Drake,

385
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,200
Privates Quinn and Glass.

386
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,000
And this here--

387
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Who's she?

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
Oh who, Meg?

389
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
Don't mind her, she's--

390
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,200
Are you here to see the dragon?

391
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
Meg, honey, not now.

392
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
But the walls are
soft, they're too soft.

393
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,800
He needs to get out.

394
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
She has her good days.

395
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
It's sad really, she was a prodigy,

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
brilliant in chemistry and biology.

397
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
We could really use her now.

398
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Ma'am, what happened here?

399
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
Well, the world ended.

400
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
That much we know.

401
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,400
Nobody really knows what
happened, at least none of us do.

402
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
A couple nuclear bombs went
off halfway around the world.

403
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Some people suspect it was terrorists

404
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
because they all went
off at the same time.

405
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But me, personally, I think
it was one of them governments

406
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,400
had a secret nuke program
that screwed the pooch.

407
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,000
No matter, once they went
off nobody could live

408
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in that side of the world so
they all decided to come here.

409
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The Western Hemisphere couldn't
house all of the refugees

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,400
and some of them had
been so badly irradiated

411
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,600
and carrying mutated viral strains

412
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,800
that they would've infected
the people around them.

413
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,400
Turning them away led to some backlash

414
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200
from the world community.

415
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh backlash is such a mild term.

416
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
It was an invasion,

417
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,800
an invasion by desperate forces.

418
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
It turned them back though.

419
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Oh yeah, they took out
a city here and there

420
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,400
but we pushed them out
through sheer force of will.

421
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
That's when, well.

422
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
That's when some punk ass bitch decided

423
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,000
if we can't have it, nobody can.

424
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,200
A suitcase bombed us
back to the Stone Age.

425
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Yeah, thanks for that douche bags.

426
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,800
Oh smoke a ball, jackass.

427
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,000
What, you wanna go?

428
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
Yes, yes, I do.

429
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,000
Will you two mutton chops cut it out?

430
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,200
All that blustering for nothing, please.

431
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,800
At any rate, Josh, Ryan, Meg and I

432
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,200
had been finding ways to
reverse the radiation damage

433
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
in the refugees when the
second round of bombs went off.

434
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
We knew Wren had a shelter
so we hid there for a while,

435
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,200
but it just, it got too
cramped so we found a new place

436
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
once the radiation levels
had dropped enough.

437
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
We retrofitted this
place to work as a lab

438
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
so we can continue trying
the fix the damage.

439
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
The damage?

440
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
You all seem okay.

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,600
Yeah, sure, externally we got lucky

442
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,400
but internally, well.

443
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Humanity's pretty screwed.

444
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Even those of us who are in shelters

445
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,800
for the actual blast,
as near as we can tell,

446
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,000
the radiation affected
the viability of 99%

447
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,400
of human reproductive cells.

448
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,000
We're probably the last generation.

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Wait, everyone's infertile?

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,600
Everyone we've tested,
at least a thousand samples

451
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,400
going back to our work with the refugees.

452
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Last men on Earth, huh?

453
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,200
Fuck yeah!

454
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,200
Just me, you and the major, Diamond,

455
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
how do you like that?

456
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
What about me?

457
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You don't count, Drake.

458
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
You're, well, funny.

459
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm bisexual, jackass!

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Really?

461
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Yes.

462
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,000
And how do you not know that?

463
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Hey, don't--

464
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,600
Shut up!

465
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,400
Diamond?

466
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
Oh damn.

467
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,200
That's right, the one and only Python.

468
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
No shit!

469
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,600
Oh, Josh, I got punched
out by Python Diamond.

470
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,600
The insurrectionist?

471
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,000
Been called worse.

472
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,000
The stones ought to come
in but they shouldn't.

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,800
They need to leave.

474
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,000
Meg, honey, what did we say about that?

475
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Give me the mirror.

476
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
But I can see the shining in it.

477
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm shining in it.

478
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
I'll find you one
that isn't broken, okay?

479
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,800
Okay.

480
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Josh, why don't you go
see who's at the door?

481
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
Oh, Kathy rig things
so a doorbells plays

482
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
when the motion sensors go off.

483
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,600
I told you it was homey.

484
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Are you really Python Diamond?

485
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
That's what they tell me.

486
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,800
Peach?

487
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,800
Guys, come take a cool.

488
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,200
I take it they're not the neighbors.

489
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
As unfortunate as it may sound,

490
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
they are indeed the neighbors.

491
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
They found us.

492
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,400
Son of a bitch, they found us.

493
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,800
It looks like they're inside.

494
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,200
So we're going in after 'em.

495
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,600
Well, that all depends.

496
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,400
On what?

497
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,200
On if they are fucking stupid or not.

498
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,600
For now, we lock it down.

499
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,200
When Silver gets here
or if they make a play

500
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
plans will change.

501
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,600
Take some of the boys.

502
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Put eyes all around the building.

503
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,000
No one gets in or out
unless I say so, got it?

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Got it.

505
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,600
Good boy, Ollie.

506
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,800
These guys come sniffing
around every once a while

507
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
trying to collect food and supplies.

508
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Two months ago they found someone,

509
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
who's another scavenger.

510
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,800
He had a canned food and a shopping cart,

511
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,600
he was collecting scrap.

512
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,000
They left with his food,
his cart and his skin.

513
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,200
Edwards, get the squad ready to move.

514
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,400
Numbers like that, I'd
rather not risk an assault

515
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,000
so our next move will be
establishing communications

516
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
but I want us ready to punch
through them if we need to.

517
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,800
Wait, wait, wait, hold
your horses there, commodore.

518
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,400
You're just gonna leave us here?

519
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
We don't know what'll happen next.

520
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,800
I'm simply taking precautions.

521
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
This can't be a coincidence, Uxbridge.

522
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
They followed us.

523
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,600
We have an obligation--

524
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,000
My obligation is to
my men in this uniform.

525
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Your obligation is to make me not regret

526
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
the current cohesiveness of your skull!

527
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,200
Private Glass, you keep this prisoner here

528
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
along with the civilians.

529
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,800
Edwards, Drake, Quinn, gear up.

530
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
You'll be covering me during negotiations.

531
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
They're here for us, they won't know

532
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
there are others hiding.

533
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,600
Permission to speak freely, sir.

534
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,400
Denied.

535
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
What's stopping them from
shooting you in the head?

536
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,800
My helmet.

537
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
You have your orders, private.

538
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,600
Uh sir?

539
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
What?

540
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,200
We found some gear
on some dead riot cops

541
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,400
when we moved in here.

542
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Maybe you could use a shield.

543
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh yeah, that's a great fucking idea.

544
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,200
Ranger Rick and the Starship Troopers

545
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
are gonna save the fucking day, right?

546
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,000
Bullshit!

547
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,800
All right, tight formation
on the other side of this door.

548
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Move!

549
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,800
You wish you were out there, don't you?

550
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
Well, look at this.

551
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,800
Whom among you should
I be speaking with?

552
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Well, I guess that'll be me.

553
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,200
Folks around here call me Gazeebo.

554
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,600
As leader of this unlawful gathering,

555
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,200
I ask that you all disperse
before any violence become--

556
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Unlawful gathering?

557
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,800
Hell, don't you need laws
for something to be unlawful?

558
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,200
I swear, you think they
didn't steal you iron jockeys

559
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
with some common fuckin' sense
of that academy of yours.

560
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
By virtue of the martial
law instituted on--

561
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Oh save it!

562
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Really, that's your line here?

563
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,200
Not we have the guns
and we have the trainin'

564
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,600
and all you got is corpses
that ain't stop breathin' yet.

565
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,200
Seriously, which one of us do you think

566
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
considers you anything but a pompous man

567
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,600
trying to throw around weight
that you just don't have?

568
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,000
Now that you've mentioned
it, we do have the guns,

569
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,200
we do have the training and all you have--

570
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,200
And all we have are
exploding fucking arrows

571
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,400
in vastly superior numbers.

572
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
I'm guessing the people
you got stashed down there

573
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,800
aren't fighters, given I ain't seen

574
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
hide nor hair in these past months.

575
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
So you got what, the four
you and one or two more

576
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,000
down there minding the sheeple?

577
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Downstairs, I don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,600
Sure you don't.

579
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,600
That shuttle of yours, an
argo military class transport,

580
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,200
standard crew of three, possible transport

581
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,600
for a maximum of eight, six
for interplanetary transit

582
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,000
which if you're talking martial
law with a straight face,

583
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,600
is abso-fucking-lutely where
you've been these past months.

584
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,400
That means you got back
to a world gone to hell

585
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,000
and I'm bettin' you went
straight for the first evidence

586
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
of people you found.

587
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
This is your last chance to disperse

588
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
without losing any of your people.

589
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,200
And this is your only
chance not to wind up dead,

590
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,800
you insufferably egomaniacal prick!

591
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,000
You walk us in, you hand
us 80% of your rations,

592
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
100% of your guns and you all can eat

593
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,600
the last of your fig mutants in piece.

594
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
You cross me and things get bloody.

595
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
They get bloody for you.

596
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
This is not gonna end well.

597
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Damn it!

598
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
We have what, two rifles and a shotgun?

599
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,000
That's about it, yeah.

600
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,200
I'm coming, too.

601
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,400
Okay.

602
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,800
Oh Josh, Wren, you guys come with me.

603
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,000
I have a bet we're gonna need
all firepower we can get.

604
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
What about me?

605
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
You have a concussion.

606
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm not putting you in harm's
way if we can avoid it.

607
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

608
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,600
Anyone else use a gun?

609
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,400
I can.

610
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
Let's move.

611
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,600
Okay, be serious.

612
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,200
You even like this guy?

613
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,000
You wanna die for this guy?

614
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Because if you come over
this side of the line

615
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,600
we take care of each other.

616
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,000
Seriously, it's like a
commune but with more vibes.

617
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Plus, you get to call yourself
a pirate and chicks dig that.

618
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We're not pirates, we're soldiers.

619
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
And if you try to take this building

620
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
you'll find out exactly what that means.

621
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,200
All that means is that
you have things I want.

622
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
I got her.

623
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,400
No, I got her.

624
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
Inside!

625
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,400
Drake!

626
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,600
No, back in the warehouse!

627
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,400
We are fucked!

628
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,000
Come on.

629
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Quinn, find something
to brace the door with.

630
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,600
Move.

631
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Move!

632
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,400
I'm sorry, sir.

633
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,200
For what?

634
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,400
I won't be much help in the fight.

635
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
I can't feel my fingers.

636
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,800
We're gonna have Glass take
a look at you, fix you up.

637
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
Don't you worry.

638
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,400
I found something.

639
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,800
Give me a hand over here.

640
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
Go help Quinn, sir.

641
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,400
Well, when you're right, you're right.

642
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,000
No sense waiting when
they're on the ropes.

643
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,600
I guess Silver is just gonna miss the fun.

644
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,400
Rag, Tag.

645
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
Hurry up!

646
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,600
I'm all right, sir.

647
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
The fuck you are, lieutenant.

648
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Shit, shit, shit, this is bad!

649
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
We gotta get her over the bunker.

650
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,000
We have to stop this bleeding, sir.

651
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,800
We can't move her like this.

652
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I'm fine!

653
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,600
Quinn--

654
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
You're killing yourself, Holly.

655
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,000
I know how this looks,
lieutenant, but I promise--

656
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,800
What--

657
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
Not even a thing.

658
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Cock sucker!

659
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,800
Quinn.

660
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,800
Quinn!

661
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,000
Come on, come on.

662
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Downstairs, come on.

663
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,600
Go, go, go!

664
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
You're supposed to aim for the girl.

665
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You were supposed to aim for the girl.

666
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,200
All right, come on.

667
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,800
Wren, give me the shotgun.

668
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Get Uxbridge and Lucy back to the bunker.

669
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You got it, kid.

670
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,400
Come on, little miss.

671
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,200
Josh.

672
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I know, go.

673
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,200
Look, I don't think they're
stupid enough to follow us

674
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
but if they are we can funnel them

675
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
straight into our crosshairs.

676
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Edwards is still alive up there.

677
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,800
No, she's not, Quinn.

678
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
She is, Lindsey.

679
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,200
If she was, she's not anymore.

680
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,000
You're a soldier, Quinn, get it together.

681
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,200
Now find cover and get ready.

682
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Clear, boss.

683
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
Well, you don't look

684
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,600
like..., do you?

685
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,200
I've patched my share of holes, you know.

686
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,400
Start talking, maybe I'd do what I can.

687
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,800
Well, iron jockey..., ain't you?

688
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Figures.

689
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I found a way down, boss.

690
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,400
Yup, just waiting on you.

691
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
You wanna go dig them out?

692
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,600
Nah.

693
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,200
But we gotta 'em on run, boss.

694
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
On the run.

695
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
You got 'em cornered you gotta 'em hurt.

696
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,800
That's when people get dangerous.

697
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm not sending people down the entrance

698
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,200
they fucking led us too.

699
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,400
Smells like strap all day long.

700
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,000
We got number, boss.

701
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
It smells like food in our bellies.

702
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah, and some of the boys
had been eating so good lately.

703
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,800
They wouldn't be eating at
all if they weren't weirdoes.

704
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
They can wait until tonight.

705
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,400
That when we bust in.

706
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,200
That's when Silver gets here.

707
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,600
Does it feel like no
one's coming to anyone else?

708
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,800
We should pull back.

709
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,600
Uxbridge will know what to do next.

710
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,200
They are pushing the offensive just yet,

711
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,800
so regrouping's the right move.

712
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
Let's go.

713
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Your soldiers have a lot
of faith in you, Uxbridge.

714
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,600
Be it for trolls and
unicorns, not soldiers.

715
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,000
Wren, take busy.

716
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
Watch the wall, okay?

717
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,400
Shot if anyone's coming.

718
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
Yes, sir.

719
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, your boy here took
quite a hit to the head.

720
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Lucy said he's gonna be all right though.

721
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,600
Well, he's not my boy, so whatever.

722
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,800
Oh, you heartless bastard!

723
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,400
There was a metal bat
that they hit him with!

724
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,600
He is lucky to remember his name.

725
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,800
I don't think you realize
the level of irony you're--

726
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,600
I should've shot you in
the head, let you in the ship

727
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,400
because you're the best
lieutenant I ever noticed

728
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
in the hands of those--

729
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,200
Enough!

730
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,400
Hey, I got you and Quinn out of an ambush

731
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,600
you willingly you walked into

732
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,800
because you are stupid enough to think

733
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,400
that this uniform somehow
makes you invincible.

734
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,200
All right, three people are dead!

735
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,600
She wants to be mad at me
'cause of Josh, that's fine.

736
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,400
It was my call to bring him
but you got your men killed

737
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,600
and if I could trade you for them I would.

738
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,400
I am not pissed because of Josh!

739
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,400
He and I both came with you, remember?

740
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,000
If these soldiers die, we lose
our only chance of survival.

741
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
Look, Josh was my fault, but this prick

742
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
he doesn't get to blame me for anything!

743
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,800
Damn straight--

744
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
Holly damn, beat them down.

745
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,800
For... sakes!

746
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Can we stop arguing
about who's fault it is!

747
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,000
Just mind the present, if you...

748
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,800
The issue I had is chain of command.

749
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,600
No, it isn't.

750
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,000
Issue at hand is staying alive.

751
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,800
Ryan, you got any movement outside?

752
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,000
What on Earth is that?

753
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,400
That's not something you see every day.

754
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,600
The fox was in with the chickens

755
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,000
but it's back to the
bands stand with her now.

756
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,200
Fly with home birds.

757
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,000
Meg, honey, eat your cereal.

758
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay.

759
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,600
Where did she get the ammunition?

760
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
The shit does it matter?

761
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
It matters.

762
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,000
Look, if they're
getting additional weapons

763
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,400
they might be prepping a push.

764
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,800
That hatch is the only way down, right?

765
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,600
Yes.

766
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,000
Okay, is it too much to
hope that we have cameras

767
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,200
inside the warehouse.

768
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,000
We had to scavenge them to
get the exteriors working.

769
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,200
Line on in the interior, okay.

770
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,400
Look, we'll keep eyes on the tunnels,

771
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,800
give a warning if they try anything.

772
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,200
In the meantime everyone gets some rest.

773
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,800
I'm feeling we're gonna need it.

774
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,200
I wasn't sure even you could
get through military coding.

775
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,800
I can crack any lock three
years before they invent it.

776
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,200
It's what these old bones know.

777
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,600
Lord knows I ain't kept around
'cause I'm pretty to look at,

778
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,800
not these days.

779
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,000
Prettier than most at a company I keep.

780
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Don't you
go saying anything bad

781
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,200
about these two little cherubs.

782
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Those iron jockeys, they leave anything

783
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,600
interesting behind?

784
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,400
I don't think you're just
dealing with soldiers, deary.

785
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,600
That shuttle, it was refitted
as a prison transport.

786
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,000
Tightened craft, huh.

787
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I thought they seem like they were stiff

788
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,400
than a crane for way too damn long.

789
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,000
Silver, come on, don't tease.

790
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
What'd you find?

791
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, where are the toys?

792
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,200
Well, not too much left, I'm afraid.

793
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,000
Just some cases of rations, some water.

794
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You know, the just the
basics you'd expect to find

795
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
in military stock.

796
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Essentials, huh, good.

797
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Anything else?

798
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,400
Ammunition, by the cartload.

799
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,800
But it's all military, so I don't think

800
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
it's gonna fit our guys
without some tinkerin'.

801
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,400
Oh, I can tinker.

802
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Let me tinker, let me tinker.

803
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,000
Boss, let me--

804
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,800
Not fair!

805
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,600
You tinkered last time.

806
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
We busted in to a military
shuttle and you're telling me

807
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,400
all we got is spare parts
and bullets we can't shoot.

808
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,600
Well, I think there might
be one thing you might like.

809
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,000
Well, shit on toast!

810
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,800
I ain't seen one of these in--

811
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,600
Lord, it must be five years.

812
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,400
Not many of them left.

813
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Not since they were
outlawed and rounded up.

814
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,600
So we're kicking in the door?

815
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,200
Soon.

816
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,200
First, we let them get tired and cranky

817
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,200
and scared out of their fucking minds.

818
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,400
Well, we just found a backdoor.

819
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,600
So my friend Bill is playing Santa

820
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,800
and I'm driving the fire
truck into the town square,

821
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,800
all the kids are there, as
Bill steps up off the truck,

822
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,600
he ain't wearing any underwear,

823
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,400
and Santa's pants go down on his ankles

824
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,800
he goes down like a bag
of hammers.

825
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,600
Comes up, I run around the truck

826
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,000
and there's Santa standing there,

827
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,400
blood running down his face
and Santa's little helper

828
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,800
is taking on it in front
of all the kids

829
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,000
and a couple of parents.

830
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,200
Oh man.

831
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,000
Look, I appreciate you
helping me keep watch, Wren,

832
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,400
but you're shot, all right?

833
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,200
Get some sleep.

834
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,800
Hey, I may not be a puppet anymore.

835
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
But I can live the life when I have to.

836
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,600
No, living's... head down, okay?

837
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,200
Start anything, we're
gonna need everyone sharp.

838
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,600
Here you go, just in case.

839
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,800
And, Python, you're a good sort.

840
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,400
Don't let anybody tell you different.

841
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,600
Yeah, well, good luck
convincing Uxbridge

842
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,000
and Lucy of that.

843
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,600
You know, Lucy had a husband
in Baltimore, well, you know.

844
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,400
Yeah.

845
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,800
All right, I'm gonna
go curl up with Kathy

846
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,000
'cause she gets mighty crabby
when I don't take the time.

847
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,200
Oh, we can't have that.

848
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,000
No.

849
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,200
Hey, if I find anybody up
there that's awake enough

850
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,400
I'll send them down here to
keep you spelled, all right?

851
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,400
I appreciate it.

852
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,800
All right.

853
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,600
Be safe.

854
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,400
I thought you could use a blanket.

855
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,600
Nothing else that'll make
the sitting more comfortable?

856
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
You looking for company?

857
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,200
I'm a bit surprised that you are.

858
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,800
Okay, the staring's getting creepy.

859
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,200
What is it with you?

860
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,800
You're gonna have to be
more specific than that.

861
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,400
To hear Uxbridge talk
about you you're the devil

862
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,600
and then Gwen starts
and you're a rock star.

863
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,000
You're Charles Manson
and then you're Gandhi.

864
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And?

865
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,600
And I wanna know the real story.

866
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,400
That all depends on
whose side you're on.

867
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Whose side are you on?

868
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,200
Come on, you could've
left Uxbridge to die.

869
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Yeah, well, I have a
soft spot for hard cases.

870
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,400
What happened in Baltimore?

871
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Baltimore.

872
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,200
Well, it happened.

873
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,400
That's not good enough.

874
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
And that's just tough.

875
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Thanks for the blanket.

876
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,400
Boss!

877
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,400
Hey boss!

878
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
You smell that boys?

879
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,600
Smells like it's time.

880
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,800
Are we ready to dig?

881
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,800
For holes.

882
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,800
If we can flank 'em all the better.

883
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,200
Boss says it's time to go.

884
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Oh, did he now?

885
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,000
All right, well, let's get started.

886
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,800
Oh, these old bones don't
move the way they used to.

887
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,000
Don't worry, we still love you.

888
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,200
Stand clear boys.

889
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,600
Great Jesus dick!

890
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,600
Gather up!

891
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,000
Boss man says four squads.

892
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,600
Squid, pick your team,
you're going down this hole.

893
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,600
Imson , Chuckie D, Frank,
time to go hunting.

894
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,400
Wait, whose got the next one?

895
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,000
Odds or evens.

896
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,800
Evens.

897
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,200
One 10,
two 10, three 10, four!

898
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,000
Yes!

899
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,800
Damn it!

900
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,400
I'm not a stone, I'm
a person like people:

901
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,000
squishy and bright.

902
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes, you certainly are that.

903
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,400
You think like me, don't you?

904
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,600
Dragons and stones,
trolls and bits of metal

905
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,400
that sting like spiders.

906
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
You see, you listen.

907
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,200
I--

908
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
I can hear swimming.

909
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,800
Swimming.

910
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,600
The others don't swim.

911
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,600
I like to camp, it makes them mad.

912
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Yeah, I'll bet it does.

913
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,800
Whirl of the ocean in the end.

914
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,800
And the beginnings, water and salt.

915
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,600
Swim, swim, swim.

916
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,600
Little heads hoping for bodies.

917
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,200
Okay, my head they're
kind of at war right now

918
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,200
so why don't you put this on and you--

919
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,000
We need to swim.

920
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,000
The stones would sink us, gulping water

921
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
'till our lungs bleed.

922
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,400
No one can swim ever again.

923
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,600
Okay.

924
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,600
Meg, I am more than happy to swim.

925
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,000
But right now I think you need to sleep

926
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,400
and maybe take your meds.

927
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,200
I can't sleep, not since the
light burned brightness away.

928
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,600
What the hell.

929
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,000
The avalanche is here now
but the dragon will stop it.

930
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,600
The avalanche, huh?

931
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,000
Well, let's go see what we can find out.

932
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,800
The dragon doesn't like visitors.

933
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,800
Come on.

934
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,000
Get inside.

935
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,800
There's only darkness now.

936
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,600
Swim, swim.

937
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,600
Clear.

938
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,600
Clear.

939
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,400
Bastard's dead?

940
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,800
It's hard not to be when you're head's

941
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,400
in three different places.

942
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,600
Yeah, it's never pretty.

943
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,800
What the hell killed them?

944
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,200
It wasn't us, so.

945
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,600
What else is in these tunnels?

946
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,400
Those sewer crocks.

947
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,000
Who the fuck knows.

948
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,200
Hey, just out of curiosity,
do you know how to swim?

949
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,000
What?

950
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,400
Never mind.

951
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,400
Yo, D, take a look at this.

952
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,800
Oh, that shit burns.

953
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,600
What is that?

954
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Fuck if I know.

955
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,600
That looks like--

956
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,400
Looks like what?

957
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
Nothing.

958
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,600
Hang on, if you know what this is--

959
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,000
I don't need to answer to you.

960
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You wanna blame me for
Baltimore that's fine,

961
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,200
but right now we have
other goddamn problems.

962
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,800
Yeah, we do.

963
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,200
And someone like you
doesn't get to figure out

964
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
how to solve them.

965
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
Someone like me?

966
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,600
Yes, someone like you.

967
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,800
What gives you the right?

968
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,600
Necessity.

969
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
Necessity?

970
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Yes.

971
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,400
You're nothing but a
cold-blooded murderer.

972
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,400
And I will not let you get us killed, too!

973
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,200
I am not--

974
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,400
Hey, back off, Diego!

975
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,000
Zip your ass down and think real hard

976
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,800
about what you want your
next move to be, kid.

977
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,000
It's all right.

978
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Let him go.

979
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,200
Look, I'm not a hero, okay?

980
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,800
Sometimes I'm wrong.

981
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,000
In Baltimore, I was very, very wrong.

982
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,200
Wrong a lot of times I bet, dickweeds!

983
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,000
It sure was.

984
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,000
Diamond!

985
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Bugger!

986
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,800
Stop doing that!

987
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,400
Yeah, stop killing our guys.

988
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,400
What?

989
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,600
Damn!

990
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,600
Well that blew!

991
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,000
Gems and stones may mend my bones,

992
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,200
but wasps will cut and sting me.

993
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,600
No, honey, there aren't any wasps here.

994
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,000
Not for a long time.

995
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,400
There weren't, but they just hid,

996
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
disguises people but wasps beneath

997
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,400
like the stones put backwards.

998
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,200
Except now the people
crack, the stones go soft

999
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,800
and the insides go outside.

1000
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,400
The facade of humanity
has long been a part

1001
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,600
of our existence, my dear.

1002
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,800
Meg, honey, we're all people here.

1003
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,000
You are, I am, Michael, Major Uxbridge--

1004
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Okay, okay.

1005
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,000
Even Mr. Diamond all people.

1006
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,000
I'm a person like
people: squishy and bright

1007
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,200
surrounded by wasps and stones and fish

1008
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,600
that gasp for air.

1009
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Diamond's becoming more
a liability than asset.

1010
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,600
While we're still under siege
I don't think we should do--

1011
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,400
I'm not denying he's at his uses

1012
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,000
but he's outlived them at this point.

1013
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,800
I suppose so, sir.

1014
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,200
You suppose so?

1015
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,800
I mean, yes, sir.

1016
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,600
Good.

1017
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,800
And be on a lookout for opportunities.

1018
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,200
Go, go!

1019
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,600
Glass, we got wounded.

1020
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,400
Clear the couch!

1021
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,200
Victor?

1022
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,400
What happened to him?

1023
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,400
Where's Lucy?

1024
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
Where's the boy?

1025
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,400
In a second, sir.

1026
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,200
Where's Lucy?

1027
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,400
What the
hell happened out there?

1028
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,800
We were ambushed by Gazeebo's soldiers.

1029
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,600
Pirates.

1030
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,400
Whatever.

1031
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,800
Look, the thing is two
of them are already dead

1032
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,800
when we arrived.

1033
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,600
That raises a question.

1034
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,000
The only question is
how many more people

1035
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,400
you're gonna get killed?

1036
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,200
It wasn't his fault, sir.

1037
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,600
The dragon breathes and boils away:

1038
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,600
green and grim and hungry.

1039
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,000
Meg, come on, shut up
about the dragon, okay?

1040
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,200
The air is too thick, it...

1041
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,600
Meg, you're not helping!

1042
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,600
We definitely got broken bones here.

1043
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,400
Femur, clavicle, skull.

1044
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,800
Jesus Christ they really
did a number on him.

1045
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,600
I know, I was there.

1046
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,400
Do what you can.

1047
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,800
I'm not sure how much that is.

1048
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,600
Do it!

1049
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,600
In the meantime, I have a question.

1050
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,800
What is this?

1051
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,800
Sewer kunk maybe, mold.

1052
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,400
I've eaten army rations,
I know what mold looks like.

1053
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,600
That ain't it.

1054
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,600
I say, unhand me!

1055
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,800
Just speaking from
experience, I wouldn't touch it.

1056
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,000
Where did you find that?

1057
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,800
It leaks from the walls.

1058
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,600
The walls are soft and the dragon can--

1059
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,600
Meg, be quiet.

1060
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,400
But--

1061
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,800
No!

1062
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,400
No, what?

1063
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,600
Look, she doesn't know
what she's saying anymore.

1064
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,200
You got any questions, just ask us.

1065
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,000
I did ask you.

1066
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,800
You weren't answering.

1067
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,600
You put my soldiers in harm's way

1068
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,400
I'm gonna hold you responsible.

1069
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,400
And you're gonna find
that extremely unpleasant.

1070
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,400
Kathy, sweetie, maybe
we should tell them.

1071
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,800
No, we took you in.

1072
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,000
What are you gonna do, shoot people?

1073
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,800
For fuck sake!

1074
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,400
I'd rather be embarrassed
than dead, Kathy.

1075
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,800
They deserve to know.

1076
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,200
Look, it was back before you found us,

1077
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,400
before we had Mr. Thurber and Gwen here.

1078
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,600
They were still doing their
experiments in the lab.

1079
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,200
Our work with the
refugees wasn't producing

1080
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,000
the results that we had hoped.

1081
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,800
Most of our subjects
were dying and quickly.

1082
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,600
They weren't dragons, they were people.

1083
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,400
Most.

1084
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,400
One didn't.

1085
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,200
Stable vitals, although he
was in pretty constant agony.

1086
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,800
We were just trying to
find out why his body

1087
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,000
wasn't dying of the radiation.

1088
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
When we had to move from the lab to here

1089
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,400
we left all the other specimens behind

1090
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,200
and then we set up and started working

1091
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,800
and that's when Lucy, she found that--

1092
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,600
That's when we started
trying to figure out

1093
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,600
what would kill those cells.

1094
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Okay, and what would?

1095
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,000
Well, nothing, at least
nothing we could figure out.

1096
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,400
It was the damnest thing.

1097
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,600
We tried anything we could think of.

1098
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,600
And eventually, we did see deterioration

1099
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,600
but vitals stayed solid.

1100
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,000
It started to leak these fluids
that we didn't recognize.

1101
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,800
Green fluids, I'm guessing.

1102
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,600
Spot on.

1103
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,400
And with physical deterioration

1104
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,800
came mental collapse as well.

1105
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,600
Soon he grew increasingly violent

1106
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,800
and he couldn't cognize properly.

1107
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,000
Where is the gent at the moment?

1108
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Dead, well, at least
we thought he was dead.

1109
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We locked him in one of those rooms

1110
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,400
and checked up on him the
next morning and he was gone.

1111
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,800
A couple of globs of
that stuff on the floor

1112
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,200
but otherwise nada, we
figure that he suffered

1113
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,800
a rapid deterioration overnight.

1114
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,000
Well, it seems like you were mistaken.

1115
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,000
So, what, we have a radioactive
refugee torture victim

1116
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,600
on the loose in the tunnels?

1117
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,000
Who wants a hug folks?

1118
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,800
Shit!

1119
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
You led them here?

1120
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,000
I didn't notice a tail.

1121
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,400
We were dragging Victor.

1122
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,600
We made plenty of noise.

1123
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,000
Damn it, we should've thought--

1124
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yes, you should've.

1125
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,200
And of course, by a hug
I mean axe in the head.

1126
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,800
Look, it's in the past, all right?

1127
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,600
Right now they aren't
really the biggest problem.

1128
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,000
Maybe they can help.

1129
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,800
Might I remind you how
[poorly] you progressed

1130
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,400
on our last attempt?

1131
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,200
That was the douche bag over here.

1132
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,000
This time it's me.

1133
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You all hear me okay in there?

1134
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,400
Come on out and play.

1135
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,200
You think you can do better?

1136
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,600
Yes, yes, I do.

1137
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,600
You killed my boys.

1138
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,400
But you come out nice and
easy maybe I let a few

1139
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,800
of your sheep survive the night.

1140
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,000
Rodriguez, go upstairs and
grab the mole from Silver.

1141
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,600
Door this heavy, explosives
just ain't gonna do.

1142
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,200
I think it's about time
we had a conversation.

1143
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Well, shit.

1144
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,600
If that ain't a blizzard in July.

1145
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,600
You're about the last
face I expected to see

1146
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,200
with those iron jockey fuck heads.

1147
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,200
Good to know you remember
your old buddy Python.

1148
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,600
Leonard Diamond, you expect
one of your gem cutters

1149
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,600
to forget your face?

1150
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,000
Five years is a long time.

1151
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,600
It's good to see you
doing well for yourself.

1152
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,200
Well, as can be expected
with the world ending and all.

1153
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,200
Yeah, I heard something about that.

1154
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,600
So pleasantry is out of the way.

1155
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,200
I'm gonna ask you once more, what the fuck

1156
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,600
are you doing with that
iron ridin' jackass

1157
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,200
of a meat puppet?

1158
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,800
Well, details are hazy
but they certainly involve

1159
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,800
punching me a lot.

1160
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,000
Things changed when we arrived.

1161
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,800
I bet.

1162
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,800
It changed now, too.

1163
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,400
How so?

1164
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,200
We aren't the only teams in the field.

1165
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,800
I don't like this.

1166
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Speaking of teams,
you wanna switch sides?

1167
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,000
Just for old time's sake.

1168
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,400
Joint forces really against

1169
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,200
a radioactive monster?

1170
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,400
Yeah, right.

1171
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,800
Pull the other one.

1172
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,800
It plays Chopin.

1173
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,800
You know me, I'm not bullshitting.

1174
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,800
If I want your squads dead.

1175
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,600
What the fuck is that?

1176
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,800
Well, what a merry little shit show.

1177
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Full of sound and fury

1178
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,600
signifying nothing.

1179
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,600
Dragons breathe, they falter, they burn.

1180
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,800
Now!

1181
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,400
Get everyone out!

1182
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,000
We're having no effect.

1183
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Fall back.

1184
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,400
You heard the man, let's move people!

1185
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,200
Watch how a real man does it, kiddos.

1186
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,400
Jesus, would you be careful with that?

1187
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,400
You know, I gotta hand it to you

1188
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
you always had a no
nonsense sort of approach

1189
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,800
to problem solving.

1190
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,200
See, easy peasy.

1191
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,200
Now, let's talk payment.

1192
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,000
No.

1193
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,800
I don't think she
understands the situation here.

1194
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,400
You're in no position
to say no, little girl.

1195
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,400
Leave her be.

1196
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Target is up!

1197
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,200
Shit!

1198
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Move, move!

1199
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,600
Move!

1200
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Don't leave him.

1201
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,400
We have to move!

1202
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,400
Victor!

1203
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
You root out those hooligans yet?

1204
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,400
Where are the rest of the boys?

1205
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,400
I sent them to ferry the
shuttle parts back to camp.

1206
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,800
You said you have this in hand.

1207
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,800
I promise you, nothing is in hand!

1208
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,800
Everything is fucked.

1209
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,800
Jesus, Wren, Kathy.

1210
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,800
Quinn, Glass, perimeter.

1211
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,600
Listen, you just reign in
the horses there, young man.

1212
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,000
Does anyone care to tell old Silver

1213
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
what in the Sandhill is going on?

1214
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Monsters.

1215
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,600
Oh, well, all right then.

1216
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,200
It's fucking Baltimore all over again.

1217
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,200
So what's the plan?

1218
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,200
I'd say get back to the ship.

1219
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,800
But judging by the ammunition
in this old bag's cart

1220
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,200
that options out of the--

1221
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,600
You show her some respect,

1222
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,000
you little jockey fuck!

1223
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,400
I'll show respect when someone--

1224
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,800
You show respect or
I'll beat some of you!

1225
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,800
Hey, seriously!

1226
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,400
Now is not the fucking time!

1227
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,800
Damn straight.

1228
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,800
Run, run, run.

1229
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,200
What?

1230
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,400
That means bad thing.

1231
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,200
Scatter!

1232
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,000
Move, move!

1233
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,400
Sick him!

1234
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,600
Fuck this.

1235
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,000
You ungrateful little cur!

1236
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,200
Supper time bitches!

1237
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Fall back!

1238
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,200
Shit!

1239
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,000
Shit!

1240
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,000
Sir, who are you aiming for?

1241
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,000
Opportunities, private.

1242
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,800
After all I'm trying
to kill that creature.

1243
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
Hey, I ain't done yet.

1244
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,000
That's an impressive piece of equipment.

1245
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,800
Yeah, I always like those things.

1246
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,000
Hey, did we just win?

1247
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,800
Well, he didn't.

1248
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,200
You son of a bitch!

1249
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,600
What, you're gonna shed tears

1250
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,600
over some iron jockey prick?

1251
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,400
I hope this would end
differently, Gazeebo.

1252
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,000
I gotta say, I hope you join up.

1253
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,400
Be quite the coupe having
a fella called Diamond

1254
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,800
as my new second.

1255
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,400
Not really the deal anymore.

1256
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,800
Call him off.

1257
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,000
I can't have you out
there as an independent.

1258
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,200
You're sporting the name
people will flock to,

1259
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,600
even these days.

1260
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,400
Says the guy who named
himself after a lawn ornament.

1261
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,200
Cute.

1262
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,400
And it's not too late to walk away.

1263
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,600
Yeah, it is.

1264
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,800
Looks like it hurts.

1265
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
It does, don't worry.

1266
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,200
Damn shame.

1267
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,400
Well, it looks like you got a little fire

1268
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,400
left in you after all.

1269
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
Don't get me wrong, it hurts like fuck.

1270
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,600
It's going as bad as I made out.

1271
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,200
I could fix that.

1272
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,400
Well, well, one of the
sheep is still alive.

1273
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm a person, like people.

1274
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,800
The fuck is wrong with you?

1275
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,600
You aren't.

1276
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,800
There's too much stone around you.

1277
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,200
You need to break the stone.

1278
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,600
I reflect a person, you reflect a stone.

1279
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,000
But you weren't.

1280
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,200
Just what are you gonna do
with that now, little girl?

1281
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,000
Let the person out.

1282
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,800
Ain't that a punch in the dick.

1283
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,000
Leonard, do an old pal a favor.

1284
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,800
You stupid, stubborn bastard.

1285
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,800
Why did he let the squishy out?

1286
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,600
I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to.

1287
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,200
Glass, get to Quinn.

1288
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,600
Bullet wound, left shoulder.

1289
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,400
Damn it!

1290
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,600
Are we stones now?

1291
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,600
No chance.

1292
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,800
I swear to God, sometimes
I think you make sense.

1293
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,800
There's too many bad
surprises in those tunnels

1294
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,200
and you, you must've come from somewhere.

1295
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,800
It's that or going to knit?

1296
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,400
My thoughts exactly.

1297
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,400
What did I miss?

1298
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,800
Shit, man, you're really hurt.

1299
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,200
Yes, yes, I am.

1300
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,200
Would not mind the gauze pad.

1301
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,400
Yeah, and I could use a shirt.

1302
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,600
I'll loan you one of mine.

1303
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,200
Downstairs must be
medical supplies, right?

1304
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,200
Do you mind?

1305
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,400
Okay.

1306
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,000
What about you?

1307
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
I just need some air.

1308
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,000
Okay.

1309
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,200
Let's get out of here.

1310
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,200
I can swim, you know.

1311
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,000
Swim, swim.

1312
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,600
Yeah, swim, swim.

1313
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,400
Let's ride.
