00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,189
<i>Barney, you're going in now.</i>

3
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,793
<i>Room nine.</i>

4
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,552
You've been unconscious for a long time, so
you're probably a little groggy. It's normal.

5
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,560
We agreed not to talk about your
past before we started the experiment.

6
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,438
But I'm Barney Snow, right?
Will I always remember it?

7
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,032
If you forget, I'll remind you.

8
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,633
That's a big vote of confidence
in someone, I don't know.

9
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,792
You must trust yourself and
your decision to participate.

10
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,789
The research is important.

11
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,996
I would ask you to think of the
hospital as your temporary home.

12
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,673
You can move freely in the area.
Come to me if you have any questions.

13
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,354
But it is a phase I hospital.
The patients are terminally ill.

14
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,518
- Apart from me?
- Yes.

15
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,511
When you are around the patients,
you must not get attached to them.

16
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,557
- Are the others lost?
- No, but they cannot be cured.

17
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,919
Well.

18
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,680
- How about you?
- If I'm sick?

19
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,555
Are you also able to opt-out?

20
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,039
It is important for the research
to maintain a friendly distance.

21
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,073
Maintain? A job for a Handyman.

22
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,356
...That is what I mean.
You can get lost in here.

23
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,918
But you don't have to
pay extra for the tour.

24
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,672
Turn right, the last
door is on the left.

25
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,871
You're the normal one
who won't die, right?

26
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,756
- Well, I guess I am.
- Follow me.

27
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,997
The palace. Mazzo is spoiled.
Now he has got a Walkman phone.

28
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,718
The mother calls him all the
time. I would adopt her if I got one.

29
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,436
- Handyman can give you one.
- Who?

30
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,476
- The doctor.
- Her name is Harriman. She is new.

31
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,595
The hospital can't afford that kind of
thing. Mazzo's family is filthy rich.

32
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,270
Who do you want to call?

33
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,432
In the previous place, I had a telephone.
I called the local radio station.

34
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,714
And said I was terminally ill.
The radio host was admittedly friendly.

35
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,472
When I asked to hear "Lick My
Love Pump", commercials came on.

36
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,995
Block Major!
You threw the ball into Mazzo.

37
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,550
So what, Mazzo?

38
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,956
Excuse me for interrupting.
The ball rolled under your bed.

39
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,152
Barney, come get your ball.

40
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,560
Mazzo has got a new phone.
It's super cool!

41
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,679
- Throw that idiot out!
- He's not an idiot.

42
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,238
- It's not him I'm referring to.
- Mazzo, this is Barney.

43
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,391
- Barney is not dying.
- Then he has nothing to do here. Out!

44
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,674
Calling Barney Snow...
The ball is in the potty.

45
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,154
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Don't let it happen again.

46
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,192
- Who is the guy with the mask?
- Dr. Croft. He leads the research.

47
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,430
- And you are envious of him.
- Do I detect a certain cynicism? Relax.

48
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,629
He is sleeping now.

49
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,398
Let's get started, folks.

50
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,554
The bumble bee experiment
on November 14, at 11.

51
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,754
Dr. Croft, Dr. Harriman and
Bernard Snow is present.

52
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,720
When I say a word, you must
respond. Can you do that?

53
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,353
- Snow.
- Me.

54
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,235
- Mother.
- Family.

55
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,632
Car.

56
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,278
Hill.

57
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,198
- Hill.
- Proud.

58
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,156
Spot shot!

59
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,390
Spot shot!
One more and he's out.

60
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,353
You're out!

61
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,190
- What are you hospitalized for?
- You mean what I die of?

62
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,236
I never saw my parents,
but they still gave me shit.

63
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,435
It is a genetic disease that
destroys the kidneys. Crazy, right?

64
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,275
- I am sorry.
- Why? Is it your fault?

65
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,957
If so, you will be beaten!

66
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,433
- Who is it?
- Allie is crazy. Something about the brain.

67
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,350
- Isn't it dangerous to sit there?
- He falls and kills himself.

68
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,070
I drove the wrong way in a red car with a
hood. A lady was standing on the road.

69
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,557
Well. Clinging to the memories.

70
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,639
So the experiment works?

71
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,118
Yes. It works. I'm busy.
We'll talk about that later.

72
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,153
Is the woman unharmed?

73
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,839
- I think I know her!
- You must not be in here.

74
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,871
You don't benefit from seeing it.
But that's how we work.

75
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,232
Are you able to do it?

76
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,957
- Billy told me about it.
- What did he say?

77
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,314
- That you wanted to "roast" Johnson.
- It's not that simple now.

78
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,912
He is involved in an experiment
which will test the use of microwaves

79
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,634
- for combating cancerous tumors.

80
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,152
- Does the treatment make him well?
- You probably know the answer well.

81
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,676
How can you stand it?

82
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,278
Don't ask me that.

83
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,673
I'm Barney Snow I
was in a car accident

84
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,714
I can't remember my
name so I won't save it here.

85
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,596
You'll be in trouble
if they find you, Billy.

86
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,680
What will they do?
Kill me?

87
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,712
Handyman said, "Don't get
involved" and you bought it, you fool.

88
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,871
Stay inside yourself. Think
you're the only one with feelings?

89
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,271
Stay away from the sick children.
Maybe you get infected.

90
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,112
Listen here, Nyresen. I will
not apologize that I am not dying.

91
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,999
If you think so, forget it. I
stay away until I get out.

92
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,990
Cool plan... Iceman!

93
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,839
Yes. You are a real iceman.
It's too cold for me here.

94
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,154
I am leaving.

95
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,597
- I taped it to your toe.
- Why right there?

96
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,874
For hygienic reasons, the
bandage must be changed regularly.

97
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,396
"I'm Barney Snow.
I was in a traffic accident. Red".

98
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,232
- Don't fear the process.
- It's my life. I don't remember anything.

99
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,673
What if the flap goes
down every time I get dirty?

100
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,919
- Dirty?
- The medicine.

101
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,718
I want to remember a bit of the
past before you sweep it all away.

102
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,551
I would like to help you.
That's my job.

103
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,879
Pardon.
But the uncertainty is scary.

104
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,393
- I understand.
- I am left to myself.

105
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,993
If you understood me,
you would not be unaffected.

106
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,832
I will give you a simple sample.
You're happy about that, aren't you?

107
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,520
Ma... Mazzo!

108
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,717
Step, Allie.

109
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,718
Come on in.
I want to talk to you.

110
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,992
I have a suggestion.
Billy wants to borrow the phone.

111
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,875
What does that have to do with me?

112
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,631
Every afternoon at  14 I am
for treatment in the basement.

113
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,437
I'm gone for an hour.
You must use the phone while I'm gone.

114
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,191
But no out-of-town calls and no
sex lines. And only for two weeks.

115
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,995
Why are you telling me that?

116
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,598
A letter from my holy sister.
She is coming to visit today.

117
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,953
She hopes my mother can
hold my hand when I die.

118
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,313
- She comes in vain.
- Does she live far from here?

119
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,798
At a Catholic school in Italy.
She dreams of becoming a saint.

120
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,755
She comes at 15 and
you must accept her.

121
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,433
- Maybe she wants to be alone with you.
- It is my needs that count.

122
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,033
- Billy is your friend, right?
- I have no friends here.

123
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,514
He is dying.
It means a lot to him to call.

124
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,589
Billy, now you just have to... listen.

125
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,431
Do not worry.
The doctor just looked at him.

126
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,392
Nyreman, the Iceman
has obtained a telephone.

127
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,669
Here we go.

128
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,195
Have you got a new hairstyle?

129
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,271
- You look good, Berto.
- I'm dying, damn it.

130
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,515
This is my friend Barney Snow.
Barney, my little sister Cassie.

131
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,795
- Are you still naughty?
- What do you mean?

132
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,278
Whenever he is in trouble,
he hides behind a cushion.

133
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,233
Once he smashed Dad's Porsche.

134
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,753
He brought a guy home from the
emergency room. His "bumper".

135
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,238
The Porsche was a cool push.
Like the Jaguar.

136
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,913
You smashed that too.
It was lucky you weren't killed.

137
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,594
Lucky?  It must not end like this.
I should have destroyed myself.

138
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,034
Better to die happy
then end my days here.

139
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,189
- You are not alone, Berto.
- Has your mother given you a sacred task?

140
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,112
It's not a conspiracy.
Mom loves you.

141
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,518
And I love you.

142
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
Just go.

143
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,309
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

144
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,070
Why aren't you inside?

145
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,955
Maybe you'll get a visit.

146
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,110
Are you getting visitors?

147
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,792
Are you an orphan?

148
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,919
Wait here.

149
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,791
- Cassie!  How is Mazzo?
- He doesn't want to know about me.

150
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,271
It hasn't always been that way.

151
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,918
Did you know we were twins?
I know we don't look alike.

152
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,752
I envy you because you can talk.

153
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,310
You must give him more time.

154
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,396
Maybe I lack your
ability to make friends.

155
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,434
- We might see each other again.
- Yes, please.

156
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,151
Shelter...

157
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,950
Something wrong?

158
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,913
Nice ass.

159
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,598
You are gay.
You get horny watching me sleep.

160
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,434
- Which gay would turn you on?
- Step!  Then I'll feel better.

161
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,000
It is a sign of health.
Can I do something for you?

162
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,192
Yes.  Step!

163
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,758
Why do you keep
playing with that ball?

164
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,909
It takes my mind
off my miserable life.

165
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,636
I thought you had forgotten.

166
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,280
- Who told you that?
- Miss Bascam.

167
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,950
Did you ask her?

168
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,478
There I got you!  You show care.

169
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,793
- Get lost!
- Scrub yourself off!

170
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,596
You feel pity!

171
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,713
Half a year ago, I could
smash you with one hand.

172
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,596
You fucking underdog,
now you pity me.

173
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,440
Get lost.

174
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,519
Now!

175
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,035
I do not understand it.
I feel like I'm thinking more clearly.

176
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,873
The fog is lifting, as you said.
But I don't know where I am.

177
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,599
I remember my name, the accident.
Nothing.  Why is that so?

178
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,192
Once you remembered less.
Consider it a fresh start.

179
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,598
Where is my family?
I want to meet them!

180
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,112
- Shall I get a glass of water?
- You are no help!

181
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,315
My memory is blank.
I am surrounded by dying people.

182
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,079
We have another test on Monday.
It will soon be over.

183
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,470
- And if I let myself be influenced?
- We have been through that.

184
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,751
Thanks.

185
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,236
Wait a minute.

186
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,956
Talking to you is a waste of time.
You are completely unaffected.

187
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,997
You don't understand what
it's like because you can't feel it.

188
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,073
Cross your fingers for me.

189
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,036
Barney, you have guests.

190
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,914
Is it true that you
live in a monastery?

191
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,479
I don't want to be a nun.
I just need to be alone.

192
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:47,791
- What is Mazzo's experiment about?
- He has a rare bone cancer.

193
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,631
- It must be hard for you.
- Do you have siblings?

194
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,710
I never wondered about that.
Have no idea.

195
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,800
Barney, talk to Berto.
He needs a friend.

196
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,119
- He is not exactly friendly.
- I know he likes you.

197
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,394
- A twin's intuition?
- Something like that.

198
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,913
Berto longs for life,
adventure and friends.

199
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,399
His anger only makes
his last days more lonely.

200
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,834
Well, Mr. Mazzo...

201
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,591
Now we're off to drive...

202
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,474
You are raving insane.

203
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,311
It makes sense.  I'm sure I
lost my memory in an accident.

204
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,674
- There must be some scars.
- Whoa!  Shouldn't I wear gloves?

205
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,156
Keep looking.

206
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,479
We are doing the test now.

207
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,711
It is risky to carry
out the experiment.

208
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,517
We should pique his curiosity to
remember harmless things.

209
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,793
In my eyes, curiosity is deadly.

210
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,791
Maybe, but we owe
him some memory.

211
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,557
Tell me about your mother.

212
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,753
There she is.

213
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,838
- Her name?
- Eileen.

214
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,919
Right.

215
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,833
- She loves Me.
- Yes.  She gives you security.

216
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,439
You remember her very clearly.
You only have good memories of her.

217
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,594
Hey Baby.  I'm looking for the number
of a certain Snow.  Like in a blizzard.

218
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,350
- Where?
- Here Monument.

219
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,552
First name?

220
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,435
Eileen.

221
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,629
And the address is...?

222
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,360
Thank you beautiful.

223
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,677
You better go again.

224
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,154
- Why are you in a wheelchair?
- Then I don't have to go.

225
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,551
Mazzo is doing well,
although he is a little pale.

226
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,311
You're not helping
me by lying, Barney.

227
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,792
He is frail and weak...
He is lying in a drop.

228
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,269
I think he's gotten worse.

229
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,399
I am sorry.

230
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,915
I came to hear the truth.

231
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,830
Why doesn't he want to know from you?

232
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,240
He has never forgiven his mother
for allowing herself to be divorced.

233
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,518
He blames her because
he knows it hurts her.

234
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,280
What about you?

235
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,475
If the mirror showed
you as you once were, -

236
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,560
-did you dare look into it?

237
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,076
- Did you see the brain scan this morning?
- Yes.  It looks good.

238
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,717
We'll be done soon.
It's great, isn't it?

239
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:12,871
Yes, but we have gone too far.  What is
most important?  The experiment or the boy?

240
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,512
The question is rather.  Why is he
more important than another boy, -

241
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,430
- which we can cure with
this form of treatment?

242
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,079
Are you feeling well?

243
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,755
Yes.  What about you?

244
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,238
Life is a deadly
disease, as they say.

245
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,595
Did it work?
Do you remember anything?

246
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,634
You were up there for two days.

247
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,917
- What day is it?  Time?
- Thursday.  13.50.

248
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,238
- Where are you going?
- I have to meet my mother.

249
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,119
Are you coming back?  Barney!

250
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,516
My mother is reserved
or cold if you ask Berto.

251
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,999
My father is the typical warm-blooded
Italian who knows how to make money.

252
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,957
Their marriage was a mistake.
It's like the poem "Fire & Ice".

253
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,155
- What is strongest?
- What do you mean yourself?

254
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:22,040
Ice.  Father's fire went out with
time, but Mother's ice remained.

255
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,871
They have been divorced
for many years, but…

256
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,150
- What?
- I waffle.  Bad habit.

257
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,479
I like it when you waffle.

258
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,679
It was a natural
reaction on Barney's part.

259
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,750
It is to your credit that he
experimented.

260
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,079
I deserve no honors.

261
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,400
If Barney stopped seeking
the truth, he would be lost.

262
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,719
Yes, but if he finds
it, he loses everything.

263
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,233
- Will you keep an eye on him?
- I'll call when he's back.

264
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,636
Barney?

265
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,837
Good luck.

266
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,750
Excuse me...

267
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,919
Father - Richard Pierce
Snow born: 2/25/1948

268
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,430
died: 7/26/1983

269
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,552
I'm looking for Eileen Snow.

270
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,075
Mother - Eileen Duval
Snow Born, 8/30, 1049

271
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,395
- Eileen?
- Yes.

272
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,118
Died: 9/25/1988

273
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,278
The bumble bee project

274
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,914
It may have been a wrong Snow.
Maybe your mother is still alive.

275
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,557
- Remember it.
- You're right.

276
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,832
Even to that extent!

277
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,598
Welcome home.
Came.  I'll give it a go.

278
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,678
Hey, Billy.  What are you doing?

279
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,994
Are you expecting a visit?

280
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,919
No.

281
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,998
- I've had a quiet day.  And you?
- Would you mind?

282
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,998
Barney is coming back.

283
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,792
He does.

284
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,191
Are you referring
to being swayed?

285
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,553
I should never have said that.

286
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,434
You should know one thing...
I admire you.

287
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,233
All the studies you apply for.

288
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,072
It must be very painful,
but I admire your courage.

289
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,400
I respect you.
You have a backbone.

290
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,870
Here you go.
You listen to more music than I do.

291
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,355
Don't stay out here too long.
Otherwise, you just freeze.

292
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,877
So what, Cassie?

293
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,351
Hi Mike.

294
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,831
You look damn good.
Where have you been all summer?

295
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,999
The beach is not the same without you.

296
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,591
Do you want to go to a pub?

297
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,720
No.

298
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,269
It's Barney Snow.

299
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:48,959
- You're not here from the city, are you?
- Me and Cassie are passing through.

300
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,919
How is Mazzo?
It's a worse mess.

301
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,114
I hear they amputated his leg.

302
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,316
- What?
- The bone cancer. It's really hard.

303
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,435
- Piss and paper!
- Mazzo is fine.

304
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,714
- Is he getting better?
- At least he doesn't crumble.

305
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,394
Should I visit
him with the boys?

306
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,759
- He will be delighted.
- What?  He is my best friend?

307
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,670
- You feel sorry for him.
- Yes, deep pity.

308
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,759
We better go now.

309
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,590
My regards Mazzo from you.
We share a living room.

310
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,829
Tell me what you know.

311
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,395
- What do I know?
- What you can remember clearly.

312
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,995
I'm Barney Snow...

313
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,797
I drove the wrong way
in a red car with a hood.

314
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,278
I remember Cassie.

315
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,594
It is a memory from the present.

316
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,910
Stay in the present.
You don't need anything else.

317
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,756
Your past is over.
The future will take care of itself.

318
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,553
End final!  You better go now.

319
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,271
Cool fight.

320
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,429
Do you want me to go?

321
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,629
Why did you agree
to be admitted here?

322
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,118
To be able to die faster.

323
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,349
If the experiment went wrong
they would probably kill me.

324
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,356
What feels the longest?
The days or the nights?

325
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,955
- Can not you Sleep?
- I have nightmares.

326
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,470
It began as a memory.
It was amazing.

327
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,355
But now it torments me.

328
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,238
What?

329
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,198
I'm sitting in a car...
A red car with a hood.

330
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,515
I'm driving, but I'm
not in control of the car.

331
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,552
- Which car brand?
- I do not know.

332
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,394
Tell us how it feels to sit there
behind the wheel at full speed.

333
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,276
A sticky feeling.  My hands
are glued to the steering wheel.

334
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,758
Do you drive with the nail in the bottom?
How does your body react?

335
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,635
I am part of the car.

336
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:17,274
I'm driving down a hill
at far too high a speed.

337
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,949
I spot a woman.  She steps out
into the street 100 m further on.

338
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,597
I'm racing out there.
Faster and faster.

339
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,079
I brake, but the
car does not start.

340
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,756
The car speeds
away and I wake up.

341
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,874
I don't hear her scream.

342
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,632
I only see her face in my mind.

343
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,111
I would give anything
to have another chance.

344
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,351
Getting behind the wheel again.
So that life can have its proper ending.

345
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,792
- Unplug, Barney.
- You mustn't ask me that.

346
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,796
I want to die.
Most of me is already dead.

347
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,352
I can not.

348
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,235
Do you want to steal a car?
Coolest!  I've tried that before.

349
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,435
- Have you stolen cars?
- I stole 25 before I got sick.

350
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,031
I kept track of them.
Toyota was the Red Sox, -

351
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,313
- Chrysler was the Yankees,
Ford was Philadelphia...

352
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,913
You've probably made a
fortune stealing toy cars.

353
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,399
- When do we shake off half the brain?
- No one cares about you.

354
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,269
- We take a shortcut to the basement.
- Is there something I haven't understood?

355
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,992
- Do you want to steal a car?
- Yes.

356
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,832
Isn't a parking lot a
more obvious place?

357
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,032
- I don't steal a car.
- What are you doing?

358
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,074
I want to build one
from old spare parts.

359
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,478
You will need a professional.

360
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,591
I pass the time playing ball
while I wait to get the dirt.

361
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,680
It's medicine, not crap.

362
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,831
If I build a car, the
memories might come back.

363
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,393
Allie can play in it as if it
were a merry-go-round car.

364
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,390
If you help me,
we can all use it.

365
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,959
- Maybe even Mazzo.
- Did you come up with it at night?

366
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,917
We must have a
place that is our own.

367
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,955
Berto!

368
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,516
Is he dying, Barney?

369
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,351
There is something wrong.
They have forbidden me to see him.

370
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,679
- Do you know what he's doing wrong?
- I'll get the doctor.

371
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,669
No.  Go to Berto.
Would you please?

372
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,678
So, so.  It will be OK.

373
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,709
Barney, go back to the living room.

374
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,713
- Can he handle it?
- Yes.  Go now.

375
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,559
Cassie, he made it.

376
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,072
I know.

377
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,393
Berto was born 58 seconds before me.

378
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,480
He calls me a little sister.

379
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,595
We have shared everything
growing up: Measles, colds...

380
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,192
But I knew there was
more under the sun…

381
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,156
A few years ago,
at Thanksgiving…

382
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,036
Berto was out with his
friends and I was sleeping.

383
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,674
I felt a pain in my left arm…

384
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,432
A sharp pain.
I threw up in the middle.

385
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:48,640
I woke up with a fever.
In the bath, I noticed the bruises.

386
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,356
I went down into the living room and met
Berto... He had his left arm in a bandage.

387
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,156
He had gone wrong on a
motorcycle with a friend.

388
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,514
My Goodness!  Did you tell him?

389
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,950
I was aware of the connection shortly
after Berto was diagnosed with cancer.

390
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,836
I never told him that…

391
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,752
I've never told
anyone... until now.

392
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,159
I am so afraid!

393
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,831
Billy!  Just give me a hand.

394
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,229
George!

395
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,794
Handy... handyman!

396
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,038
<i>Live in the moment, live in the moment, Barney.</i>

397
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,716
It hurts me, Barney.
It hurts me.

398
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,278
Your case has been
named the Humlebi project.

399
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,192
A bumble bee should not be able to fly.
Its wingspan is too small.

400
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,358
Still, it flies.

401
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,873
There are several theories about the phenomenon,
but the most important one is Willpower.

402
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,677
The bee does not know that
the impossible becomes possible.

403
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,829
In your case we used drugs,
hypnosis and the nightmare -

404
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,956
- to build a wall around
your long-term memory.

405
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,593
I know it's hard,
but I have to tell you.

406
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,874
We wanted to hide your past so
you could create your future.

407
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,678
Unfortunately, your entire past was
erased.  Prof.  Croft let you post here -

408
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,590
- and I have tried to awaken
your childhood memories.

409
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,273
You were fully aware of the
circumstances and your background -

410
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,950
- when you signed up for the project.

411
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,357
- Who am I?
- Barney Snow.

412
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,076
- Where is my family?
- You are an only child.

413
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:58,515
Your father died when you were two years old.
Your mother was killed when you were seven.

414
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,351
You have lived with three different
foster parents.  It didn't work.

415
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:08,839
Your memory of your mother's death
was the background of the memory wall.

416
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:19,110
- Behind the wall.
- It will get even worse.

417
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:26,437
When Professor Croft visited you, you
were in a youth hospital for the dying.

418
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,350
- Why?
- You had bone cancer.

419
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,997
You were on the mend, so
you were perfect for the project.

420
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,751
You were under anesthesia while we operated,
and your symptoms gradually disappeared.

421
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,590
You woke up here,
safe and sound.

422
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,192
A healthy NN.

423
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,473
When Croft hears about
this, he sees two possibilities.

424
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,390
1. The project is discontinued.  If you
relapse, the disease runs its course.

425
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,197
2. We try again and you
forget everything you've heard.

426
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,110
- Give me another alternative.
- I wish I could.

427
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,513
- What are you up to now?
- How are you feeling?

428
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,111
How do you think I feel?

429
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,593
- The nights...
- What?

430
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,316
The nights are the hardest.

431
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,639
You will soon come
home to your teddy bear.

432
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,353
Should I get the nurse?

433
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:35,194
You haven't seen me when I'm sick.
Go away.  You don't belong here.

434
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:49,196
Mazzo... Yes, I do.

435
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,434
You lied to us, you satan.

436
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,190
No.  The doctors lied to me.

437
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:07,671
The experiments with
memory manipulation of cancer.

438
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:16,552
If you had to let go of
your past for a future…

439
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,557
...would you do it?

440
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:33,150
I have done that...
This is my life.

441
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,392
But the memories emerge.
Good memories.

442
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,833
Reminds me of my
mother when I was little.

443
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,959
But a new nightmare
has appeared...

444
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:57,714
About a time not so long
ago when I was in your place.

445
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,479
Come here.

446
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,199
- You don't need to knock.
- It brings luck.

447
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,598
Come in, Barney.  Take a seat.

448
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,232
Until recently, my cancer
research didn't count for anything.

449
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:52,834
But my technique makes it
possible to remove those signals,

450
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,240
- the brain sends to the cancer
cells, which cause the tumor to grow.

451
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,911
By erasing your past, I have severed
the connection between Mind and body,

452
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,158
which fed your cancer.

453
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,835
It can be compared to
dubbing a videotape

454
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,034
- to delete an unwanted program.

455
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,518
You have deleted my favorite show.

456
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:27,069
Three months ago you were
dying and haunted by the past.

457
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:33,549
I didn't know the alternatives.
I'm sorry.

458
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,718
So am I.

459
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,634
You guys are done if I
don't agree to try again?

460
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,916
Yes.  We cannot proceed
without your permission.

461
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,079
Do you believe it will succeed?

462
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,639
I believe the professor's work will be
able to benefit several patients.

463
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,719
But...?

464
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,040
But the loss of the
person's identity is a big cost.

465
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,118
Now listen here...

466
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,757
If you help us, we can
achieve better research results.

467
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,670
One fine day we can isolate
the thoughts that feed the disease.

468
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,671
We can then produce a medicine
that only changes part of the identity.

469
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,909
- It could save lives.
- I need time to think.

470
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,469
For your own sake, we should
resume treatment as soon as possible.

471
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:55,311
You will have one day to think about it.
Then you will be moved -

472
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,310
- to a new research center
or back to the hospital.

473
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,795
- It's almost finished.
- Yes, now we just need...

474
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,353
What's up, Barney?

475
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:25,838
After effects... from the medicine.

476
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,838
Cassie... are you okay?

477
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:46,716
Where have you been?
What do you look like?

478
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,754
Let's go for a walk.
There is something I want to tell you.

479
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,718
I'm going back to Italy.

480
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:08,478
It was wrong of me to come.
It benefits neither me nor Berto.

481
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,590
- When do you leave?
- The day after tomorrow.

482
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:37,231
Try to understand.  I don't know
how I will react when Berto dies.

483
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:49,589
Although I was hazy, I
remembered you clearly.  Only you.

484
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,637
Cassie, you have to promise me one thing.

485
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:17,191
If at some point I have forgotten
about us, please remind me.

486
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,798
I promise.

487
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:15,153
- Are you going back to the monastery?
- Yes.

488
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,753
Well.  God must have missed you.

489
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,312
At least Barney will miss you.

490
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:33,874
Barney... I know you've been
keeping an eye on Cassie.

491
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:40,515
That's how she is now.
She always has to do things for me.

492
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,831
It's not your fault, Cassie.

493
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,830
You can't control my
disease, so drop it.

494
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,197
I pull her into the fall.
It must not happen.

495
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,109
Say goodbye nicely and go with you.

496
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,960
At least one of us
deserved to have a good life.

497
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,076
- I better go...
- No!

498
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,671
- Do you never sleep?
- You shouldn't have talked.

499
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,029
- What have you done?
- I've done my rounds.

500
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:33,635
- Why are you here, Billy?
- The neighborhood appeals to me.

501
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,279
- Neighborhoods consist of houses.
- There is not that much fart here.

502
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:44,839
I will not be forwarded
to new foster parents.

503
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,274
I have my room.
No fake siblings.

504
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:55,680
No family dog ​​that says,
"Who the hell are you?"

505
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,513
Are you feeling well?

506
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,793
Working on the car
has taken a toll on you.

507
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,678
- It's over.
- Shall we go for a drive tomorrow?

508
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,874
I am leaving now.
Take good care of yourself.

509
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,516
Go to sleep.

510
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,678
The time is now.

511
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,999
All I can give you is a
moment of happiness.

512
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,755
Everything but this.

513
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,310
They are connected to an alarm.

514
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:23,640
I have seen how they cut it off
when I have to undergo treatment.

515
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,999
Are you sure now?

516
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,596
- I can go myself.
- We only have to go to the elevator.

517
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,237
- The elevator?
- No questions, please.

518
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,760
Hey guys!  Where are you going?

519
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,796
- Go to bed with you.
- I want to cuddle.

520
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,275
- I can go.
- And I can tap.  Sit in the chair.

521
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,639
- What the hell is that?
- Say hi to Bumblebee, Mazzo.

522
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,038
- What?
- It is a long story.

523
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:39,670
Should I be messing around with that
thing?  a moment of happiness you say?

524
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:45,080
- Why didn't you steal a real car?
- He's onto something there.

525
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:50,195
- Can you drive a car?
- I can try.  Can't you drive?

526
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:57,431
The red car was a mirage.
I've never been behind a wheel.

527
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,678
I like to drive.

528
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,673
Should I have pulled the plug
and hidden you in a closet?

529
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,032
I am grateful to you, Barney.

530
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:45,360
It looks more like a skateboard.
It requires a different way of thinking.

531
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,991
I had completely forgotten
I lived in that world.

532
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,191
How beautiful it is here.

533
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:21,073
I call that a moment of happiness.

534
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,673
Hello?  Yes, I'll be right back.

535
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,196
What are you guys up to?

536
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,232
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

537
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:31,230
I've looked in all
the usual places.

538
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,959
- Should I call the police?
- No.

539
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:59,272
- Are you feeling well?
- Stupid question.

540
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,438
Are you ready?

541
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,073
You guys are insane!

542
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,150
The red carpet is rolled out, Barney.

543
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,356
I have always played with death.
I, the crazy Mazzo.

544
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:07,031
It gave me a feeling
that I was alive.

545
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,915
I have that feeling now.

546
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:19,435
I feel more alive than
ever... and more scared.

547
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,996
Do not do that.
I ride with you.

548
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,750
We don't need
these wasted bodies.

549
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,998
Forget it.

550
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,118
Take the medicine.

551
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,871
Experiment.
Wash the board clean.

552
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,960
No.  Now I'm here with you.

553
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,671
Now you stop!

554
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,874
- Go with you, Billy.
- Why do you do that?

555
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,078
You haven't told him?

556
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,792
The Iceman is melting, Billy.

557
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:12,359
- Our Lord at locum!
- It was the memory they removed.

558
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,277
Can you feel the wind?

559
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:40,755
You drive faster and faster.
Let go, Mazzo.

560
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,111
Maybe we will be luckier in
the next life.  Just look at me.

561
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:54,750
I came back to the same life and
met Billie, Allie, Cassie, and you.

562
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,672
Hold on to your hat and cane.

563
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,354
Clung.

564
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,593
Barney, what are you doing?

565
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,112
- I'll go with him.
- Why?

566
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:47,555
- His life is over, yours is not.
- I'm losing it all because of you.

567
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,879
Cassie and this
night never existed!

568
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,119
No one can take those memories
away from you.  We have proven that.

569
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,678
The most important memories do not
disappear.  Your mother stayed with you.

570
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,477
You will be able to remember all
the things you appreciate.  Do not.

571
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,198
Do as she says, Barney.

572
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:17,237
I didn't have much to lose.
I had no family, no loved ones.

573
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,718
You must not take that away from me!

574
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:28,475
You should choose life.
Make the right choice.

575
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,393
No, Barney!

576
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:29,030
Did you hear anything?
I didn't hear anything.

577
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,391
Come in.

578
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,599
Hello.
