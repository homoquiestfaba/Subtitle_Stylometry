181

of one of your divers

184
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,140
I'm Megan Arthur, professor of
marine biology from the U of A.

185
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:25,119
- How do you know it was our diver?
- Diver's suit had your logo on it.

187

- In my lab.
- Excuse me?

188

If I let the coroner collect the body
before I could properly research it,

189
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,357
his report would
claim shark attack.

been attacked by a sea vampire.
