1
00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>[Arcturus Mengsk:] They say a man
never really knows himself...</i>

2
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:15,247
<i>until his freedom's been taken away.</i>

3
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:23,347
<i>I wonder...</i>

4
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:29,810
<i>How well do you know yourself?</i>

5
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:46,369
<i>[Adjutant:] Prisoner,
step forward onto the platform.</i>

6
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:18,129
<i>[Arcturus Mengsk:] Convict 626.</i>

7
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,271
<i>Murderer.</i>

8
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,108
<i>Pirate.</i>

9
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:25,624
<i>Traitor.</i>

10
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:30,622
<i>Today... you go free.</i>

11
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:42,659
<i>But, as you'll soon learn...</i>

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,476
<i>Even freedom has a price.</i>

13
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:42,329
<i>[Adjutant:] Combat suit,
sealed and locked.</i>

14
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,699
<i>[Arcturus Mengsk:] You'll carry
your prison with you.</i>

15
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:51,031
<i>That armor
will be your new cell.</i>

16
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:55,796
<i>Make no mistake...</i>

17
00:02:57,548 --> 00:03:00,550
<i>War is coming.</i>

18
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:05,032
<i>With all its glory...</i>

19
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:10,029
<i>And all its horror.</i>

20
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:12,780
<i>Mr. Findlay...</i>

21
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,483
<i>Your freedom awaits.</i>

22
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:21,264
<i>[Tychus Findlay:] Hell...
It's about time.</i>
