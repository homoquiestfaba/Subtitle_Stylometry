1
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,871
My name is Hope Cassidy.

2
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,517
Sometimes all you have
is your name. Hope.

3
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,323
Attention, attention!!

4
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,763
Suspect Kelly Roos is heading
for the Grand Bazaar.

5
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,493
Cover all the exits!!

6
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,182
Move!

7
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,622
My parents planned
on having three girls:

8
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,795
Hope, Faith and Charity.

9
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,863
A plane crash prevented
there being any Faith or Charity...

10
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,533
...leaving only Hope.

11
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,369
Get out of the way!

12
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,098
My dad used to say to me:

13
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,210
"In times of trouble, you only
have to remember who you are.

14
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,472
Because no matter how bad things
will get, there's always hope. "

15
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,119
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

16
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,693
My father was an eternal optimist.

17
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,798
That's what made him think his plane
wouldn't go down in that thunderstorm.

18
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,294
He was wrong.

19
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,884
I'm not Kelly Roos.

20
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,460
English.

21
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,363
Hope!

22
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,469
My name is Hope Cassidy.

23
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,930
Where am I?

24
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,600
In Capa Hospital. Istanbul.

25
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,601
Feel like talking, Kelly?

26
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,673
My name's Hope.

27
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,540
Put this on.

28
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,475
Not my color.
Can I see what else you have?

29
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,416
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

30
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,353
Where--? No. No! No!
You can't just leave.

31
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,589
What are you doing? No. No! No!
Where are you taking me?

32
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,936
Where am I going? No!
Where are you taking me?

33
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,961
Where am I going? No!
Where are you taking me?

34
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,601
Who's watching me?

35
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,712
Dr. Kavak.

36
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,415
Where am I?

37
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,318
Jail. In Istanbul.
Maximum-security.

38
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,428
But you're not a doctor, are you?

39
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,858
You're a shrink.

40
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,165
Here to see if I'm fit to stand trial?

41
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,102
-I'm Dr. Kavak.
-And I'm Hope Cassidy.

42
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,833
That is why we are here.
To see exactly who you are.

43
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,567
I know who I am.

44
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,613
-What--? Do you think I'm crazy?
-No.

45
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,717
-Delusional?
-Yes.

46
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,418
You need to tell me how
this happened.

47
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,082
Oh, you fixed it.

48
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,224
-You're a genius.
-No.

49
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,419
It is my job.
I just returned it to normal.

50
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,925
-I'm really tired of normal, James.
-Hope, we've been over this.

51
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,070
-We were gonna live together anyway.
-I have my studies.

52
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,969
You can research dinosaurs anywhere.
A little thing called the Internet.

53
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,975
-I've pulled up some websites for you.
-I'm settled here.

54
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,413
-Do you want me to go alone?
-Better still...

55
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,608
...not at all.

56
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,752
Can you--? Can you put this down
for a second?

57
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,387
Someone has actually requested me.

58
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,187
Actually wants me.

59
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,494
Besides, we need a change.
I-- I need a change.

60
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,500
-I need some adventure in my life.
-Order the steak tartare.

61
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,969
Mad cow is on the rise.

62
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,909
-Have you decided?
-I've decided what I want.

63
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,272
How about you, James?

64
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,112
Well, she's waiting.

65
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,911
-So am l.
-I'll come back.

66
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,678
What?

67
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,255
I love you.

68
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,918
But come on, Istanbul?
It's the other end of the world.

69
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,258
-It's not safe, it's full of terrorists--
-No, no, no.

70
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,661
I've checked.
I talked to the State Department.

71
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,837
There's probably more terrorists
in your vertebrate class...

72
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,405
...than there is in Turkey.

73
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,701
I don't have a ticket.

74
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,801
Yeah, you do.

75
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,240
I got them to give me two tickets.

76
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,217
First-class. Look, I've never
done anything first-class in my life.

77
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,388
This is a major corporation.

78
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,720
Suzer International
has offices all over the world.

79
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,021
You've got a job there.

80
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,498
What is the point of me going?

81
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,725
I'd be there.

82
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,903
You know what,
I'm on that plane tomorrow, okay?

83
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,008
Here's your ticket. I know
what it means if you're not there.

84
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,871
This is crazy. Come on.

85
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,242
Did you think about this?
Do you know what you're getting into?

86
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,680
For once in my life, yeah, I do.

87
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,215
Hope. Hope.

88
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,192
-Hello.
-What?

89
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,268
-Hi.
-Hi.

90
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,764
-Get it all the way up.
-Okay.

91
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,168
-Are you in here?
-Yes.

92
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,571
-We're having fun...
-We're having fun.

93
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,770
-...making little videos for ourselves.
-Bye.

94
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,278
Ladies and gentlemen...

95
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,552
...the final boarding call
for flight 101 to Istanbul.

96
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,322
I don't understand how they do it.

97
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,266
-What's that?
-Internet on these planes.

98
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:47,463
Well, it's very technical.
It's what you would call magic.

99
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,006
Good explanation.
The only thing that makes any sense.

100
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,341
Roxelena. Pretty name.

101
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,009
Is it your first time to Istanbul?

102
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,510
-Coming for a job.
-You'll love it. Many places to see.

103
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,021
You must go to Ortaköy.
To the cafés there.

104
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,819
I'm always there
when I'm not here.

105
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,553
-Ortaköy.
-Yes.

106
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,164
Thanks. You know what?
I'll give it a try.

107
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,458
Okay.

108
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,359
I'm Hope.

109
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,004
Just plain Hope.

110
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,573
-Not a name I would've chosen.
-You don't like it?

111
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,742
As a kid, I always wanted to be Diana.
Like the Greek goddess.

112
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,716
-Goddess of the moon.
-Yeah.

113
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,579
Diana. All right.

114
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:39,486
Look, since this is your first time,
you could use this.

115
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,751
-No, I'm sorry, I can't take this.
-You must.

116
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,258
Turkish hospitality.

117
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,057
This is an evil-eye bracelet.

118
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:54,772
Turkish people believe that it protects
you from evil eye or bad luck.

119
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,969
You see, nothing is ever
as it seems in Istanbul.

120
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,879
Thank you.

121
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,413
You sure you don't want something?
Champagne?

122
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,209
To celebrate the new job?

123
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,420
-Why not?
-Okay.

124
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,926
-Here you go. Enjoy.
-Thanks.

125
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,602
You know, this could happen to you.

126
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,874
To anyone. Do you have
credit cards, driver's license?

127
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,381
-Of course.
-Okay, well, I guarantee you...

128
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,283
...that someone has used your identity
and you don't even know it.

129
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,026
But how can they steal who you are?

130
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,927
When there's not much to steal.

131
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,541
Thanks. Next, please.

132
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,252
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Thanks.

133
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,597
-Wait, this says "tourist."
-What it is.

134
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,825
No, I have a work visa,
I'm moving here.

135
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,868
No work visa.
Your passport expires too soon.

136
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,539
-Next one, please.
-No, no, wait a minute.

137
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,174
The Turkish consulate said--

138
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:42,006
Go to American consulate, get
new passport. Next, please! Please.

139
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,054
Suzer International.

140
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,889
Yes, my name's Hope Cassidy,
I'm trying to reach Ali Abay.

141
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,359
-Okay.
-He hired me.

142
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,860
You're at the airport now?

143
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,499
I just arrived from America...

144
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,760
...and someone
was supposed to meet me here.

145
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,267
There should be a driver.

146
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,873
No, no. No one's here,
there's no driver or....

147
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,839
Oh, I'm sorry,
you'll have to take a cab.

148
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,808
Take a cab.

149
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,973
I exchanged a few dollars
at the L.A. airport.

150
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,311
Twenty-seven million
two hundred thousand.

151
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,513
-What?
-I said, 27,200,000 Turkish lire.

152
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,056
-I take you to hotel.
-Twenty-seven....

153
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,526
-I don't have 27--
-Twenty dollars, same thing here.

154
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,226
Hey. No, no, wait a minute!
You don't even know what hotel I'm at.

155
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,762
Hotel Sultanahmet Palace.
Just near the blue mosque.

156
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,066
It's very nice. Don't worry about it.

157
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,006
Wait a minute, how do you--? Hold on.
Could you tell me what hotel I'm at.

158
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,909
-Sultanahmet Palace.
-The Sultanahmet Palace. Thanks.

159
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,345
How the hell did you know that?

160
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,182
I think you are American.
Americans stay there.

161
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,255
You have a lot of luggage.

162
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,222
There, people stay long time...

163
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,394
...and you dropped this,
your schedule.

164
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,600
-Right?
-Right.

165
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,398
To the hotel? Yeah.

166
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:20,474
But first I need to go by the U.S.
Embassy to get my passport fixed.

167
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,705
Sure, as you wish, no problem.

168
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,978
Here.

169
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,447
Here.

170
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,270
Istanbul has population
of over 1 2 million.

171
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,303
It was founded
in the seventh century...

172
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,737
...and was the capital
of Byzantine Empire...

173
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,937
...and then of Ottoman sultans.
It was once called Constantinople.

174
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,883
-Hang on. Sorry.
-Yeah.

175
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,609
Istanbul is beautiful city.

176
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,754
-I hope you like it, yeah?
-Yeah, excuse me.

177
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,721
-Yeah?
-I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

178
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,726
Oh, sorry. Osman.
My name is Osman.

179
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,266
Osman. Look, I really appreciate
the tour, I do, but I'm really tired.

180
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,905
-Jet lag, you know?
-Sure, of course. This is why I talk.

181
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:27,511
I see you have come alone. You will
be joined by, how you say, boyfriend?

182
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,510
How you say, horse's ass?

183
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,116
Yes, of course. Horse's ass.

184
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,850
I am sorry. Traffic is very bad.

185
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,394
I can do this. I can do this.

186
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,862
I can do this.

187
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,810
Sign there and date, please.

188
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,073
How long do you think it will take
for my passport? A few weeks?

189
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,908
No, no, no. We're a small office...

190
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,484
...but I e-mail Washington,
assuming no hitches...

191
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,383
...you can walk in tomorrow
and walk out with a temporary.

192
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,026
-You're a hero.
-Thanks. Please, tell that to my wife.

193
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,525
-We open at 9.
-Okay, I'll be here. Thank you.

194
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,697
Great. Next!

195
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,594
A butterfly tattoo...

196
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,532
...on his hand.

197
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,673
Find this guy, he can vouch for me.
He knows I'm not Kelly Roos.

198
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,292
This is the best you can do,
an embassy clerk?

199
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,520
I know no one here.

200
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,837
-Yes.
-Yes.

201
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,965
Right.

202
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,914
You need something, anything
or even nothing...

203
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,680
...you call. I'm good for anything,
good for nothing. I'm always here.

204
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,687
Okay, I'm sure I'll be fine.

205
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,917
-Here you go.
-Yeah, thank you.

206
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,651
Bye.

207
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,234
Here you go.

208
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,367
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

209
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,623
Do you know how long this will take?

210
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,521
I don't know.
I think no more than an hour.

211
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,720
-No, no. No, and I won't calm down.
-This is no problem.

212
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, first, my luggage is just gone...

213
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,397
...like the guy I'm supposed to travel
with, and now I can't get in my room.

214
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,166
-No, I just wanna go to my room--
-Hey, hey.

215
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,035
-What?
-Are you all right?

216
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,405
No! Wait a minute.
Are you American?

217
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,808
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, thank God!

218
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,539
Oh, my God.

219
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,581
I just wanna go to my room,
you know?

220
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,652
Yeah, I do. Well, they said
it's gonna be about an hour.

221
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,187
Oh, no.

222
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,859
Hey. You wanna get a cup of coffee?
My treat.

223
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,189
I have a better idea.
Can we have a drink?

224
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,494
Okay? Okay.

225
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,226
Oh, thank God.

226
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,935
What kind of name is Z.Z.?

227
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,269
Apparently, I was conceived
to a ZZ Top song.

228
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,813
So I don't know,
this is not what I expected.

229
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,911
I actually didn't know
what to expect.

230
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,019
-I'm glad I'm here, though.
-Yeah?

231
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,487
-Yeah.
-For a job?

232
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,025
Someone called me out of the blue,
had apparently checked me out.

233
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,891
I was so excited,
I sent him a dozen roses.

234
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,496
I haven't sent a guy roses in my life.

235
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,170
-So are you gonna stay?
-Yeah, I....

236
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,498
I kind of have to.

237
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,402
-You have to?
-Yeah, whatever.

238
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,703
Just make the best out of whatever
situation you're in, you know?

239
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,436
Right.

240
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,878
Well, I'm glad you're here.
Maybe we can explore together.

241
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,882
-It'll be fun.
-I'd like that.

242
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,421
-Hope, listen--
-Hello!

243
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,385
I'll make a good deal for you, huh?

244
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,320
-Pretty scarf, see?
-No.

245
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,018
Are you married, girls?
I can give you a tour in the harem...

246
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,593
...like no one ever seen before.

247
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,131
-At the Topkapi Palace.
-Okay.

248
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,359
No?

249
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,670
No!

250
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,006
-Hello?
-It's Ali. Good morning.

251
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,270
We have your first assignment.

252
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,879
Galata Financial.

253
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,050
Their security system is failing,
vulnerable to attack.

254
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,775
They need our best...

255
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,682
-...smartest, cleverest.
-I'm anxious to get started.

256
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,222
First I need to go to the consulate
and get my visa straightened out.

257
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,020
Then right after,
they'll be expecting you.

258
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:22,030
Sounds great. Just send the directions
and info to my Pocket PC, please.

259
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,293
Yes, okay.

260
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,027
Hi.

261
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,672
Could you connect me
with Z.Z. Jackson's room?

262
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,739
Of course.

263
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,606
I'm sorry, but we don't have anyone
registered under that name.

264
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,980
Well, that's impossible.
She checked in yesterday.

265
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,516
No.

266
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,654
There seems
to be a misunderstanding.

267
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,381
Okay. Thank you.

268
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,256
-Taxi.
-Taxi!

269
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,140
Thank you.

270
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,180
-Look what I have for you right here.
-Yes!

271
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:21,119
Brand-new. You won't have any
problem getting a work visa with that.

272
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,784
Thank you so much. That was
so easy. It usually takes, like--

273
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,895
-This is not me.
-Everybody hates their picture.

274
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,263
-You should see mine.
-No, that's my picture...

275
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,939
...that's my address.
But that's not my name.

276
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,869
My name is Hope Cassidy,
this says--

277
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,372
-Kelly Roos.
-Yeah.

278
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,711
-Are you sure this isn't you?
-Yes, I'm sure this is not me!

279
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,781
-You have to change it.
-We're just a consulate.

280
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,044
We can do renewals of passports
here, but reissues...

281
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,586
...has to be done
by the embassy in Ankara.

282
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,385
-I can't-- I can't believe this.
-I don't know what to tell you. I mean....

283
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,653
On the computer,
I have you as Kelly Roos.

284
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,991
-And so maybe there's some error or--
-This is not normal.

285
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,928
I'm sorry.

286
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,500
I'll try and clear this up
as quickly as I can.

287
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,069
Can you come back Thursday?
Friday, maybe?

288
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,764
Okay, thank you.

289
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,443
Next!

290
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,077
I'm so tired.

291
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,339
-Can we please just take a break?
-No.

292
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,184
No?

293
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,820
Tomorrow you will be charged
for a double murder...

294
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,820
-...and the theft of millions of dollars.
-I want a lawyer.

295
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,586
-I have one day to see you--
-No, I want a phone call!

296
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,195
And I want to know everything
about the murders.

297
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,593
-About the money!
-You can't keep me locked up!

298
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,667
I'm an American citizen
and I have rights!

299
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,274
I want my phone call, I want
my lawyer, and I want it now! God!

300
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,310
Let's continue.

301
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,358
What are you doing here?
Are you following me?

302
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,001
-No, no, no. I'm just trying to work.
-You've got to stop following me.

303
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,862
-It's freaking me out.
-All right.

304
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,268
-How will you get to next appointment?
-Well, l....

305
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,574
All right.

306
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:25,213
-How many millions will this cost me?
-Don't worry, it's no problem.

307
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,817
We will come to an arrangement.

308
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,188
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

309
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,269
So this is Galata's offices?

310
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,872
Yeah, they are wealthy company
and eccentric.

311
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,305
I know these people.

312
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,845
-I'll probably be a number of hours.
-All right, I wait.

313
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,043
Okay.

314
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,681
Okay.

315
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,846
My name is Hope Cassidy
to see Mr. Ibrahim Zoralan.

316
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,582
ID?

317
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,196
-Oh, I have a driver's license.
-Yeah, okay.

318
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,629
Well, I had my driver's license.
I don't know--

319
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,737
-It has to be in here somewhere.
-Hope Cassidy!

320
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,431
So pleased to have
you be my acquaintance.

321
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,838
Ibrahim Zoralan, come with me.

322
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,739
I've heard so much about you.

323
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,609
This is our new offices.

324
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,811
Built in late 1 800s
by one of the last sultans.

325
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,082
You can still see the construction
going on.

326
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,727
Galata is an international
holding company.

327
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,729
A hundred million dollars
a day go through here...

328
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,264
...through our supercomputer.
Right this way, please.

329
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,767
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-You tripped the alarm.

330
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,339
-You're lucky I'm here.
-To turn it off?

331
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,442
That, and....

332
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,109
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

333
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,973
Ibrahim Zoralan.

334
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,146
Voice-activated security?

335
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,086
My own design.
And cannot be duplicated.

336
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,492
So this is it. Galata's nerve centre.

337
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,495
Our supercomputer.

338
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,694
I call it Ibrahim.

339
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,028
After myself, of course.

340
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,331
-Impressed?
-With the computer?

341
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,803
Yes.

342
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,839
You've got firewalls tripping
all over each other...

343
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,779
...routers that date to Constantine.

344
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,818
Also, you see that,
what's going on up there?

345
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,149
You are about one broken
security key away...

346
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,815
...from someone having access
to every dollar going through here.

347
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,487
Well, that's why you're here.

348
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,495
Ibrahim needs protection.

349
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,033
He's tense, he works very hard.

350
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,962
He needs your women's intuition.

351
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,074
Your comforting.

352
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:11,412
Mr. Zoralan, I'm being paid
about $475 an hour...

353
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,481
...because I'm fast and good.

354
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,209
When not distracted.

355
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,911
Now, if you feel you like
my company that much...

356
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,852
...this could take about a month.

357
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,058
-If I back off?
-I'll be done by tomorrow.

358
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,421
I'll miss your wonderful company.

359
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,964
I'm sure your wife will take
your mind off of it.

360
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,742
I will have my security liaisons officer
to watch you until it is time to leave.

361
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,377
Why, you don't trust me?

362
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,677
With the amount of money
going through here...

363
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,374
...I do not trust Allah
to be alone here.

364
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,119
Good luck, Miss Cassidy.

365
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,616
Thank you.

366
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,517
What's that?

367
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,619
The consulate guy.

368
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,384
He was found floating
in the Bosphorus an hour ago.

369
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,594
Don't you get it?

370
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,998
These people are doing
everything they can...

371
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,140
...to keep you from finding out
who I am.

372
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,640
Are you sure it's not you doing
everything to stop me?

373
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,948
Don't give me that
psychological babble.

374
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,845
These people are trying
to destroy me!

375
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,692
-Who are you?
-What? I'm sorry?

376
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,490
Who are you?

377
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,528
I don't understand.
I'm Hope Cassidy.

378
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,639
-No, you're not.
-Excuse me?

379
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,174
I just spoke to Ali Abay
from Suzer International.

380
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,006
I was telling him how happy
we were to have you here.

381
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,806
He told me you were an impostor.

382
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,008
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

383
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,017
Do you have an ID? A passport?

384
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:37,187
Of course. I.... I just--
I don't have it with me.

385
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,492
Look, you know what?
Let me give Ali a call...

386
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,464
...and we'll get this whole thing
cleared up. Okay?

387
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,830
-Okay.
-Suzer International.

388
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,066
Yes, my name's Hope Cassidy,
can I speak with a Mr. Ali Abay?

389
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,677
-Hope Cassidy?
-Yes. Hope Cassidy.

390
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,642
Please hold.

391
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:01,511
Hello, this is Hope Cassidy. Hello?

392
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,254
-Hope Cassidy, can I help you?
-No! Okay.

393
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,890
Hello? Hello?

394
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,360
No, there's--

395
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,723
There's been a mistake!
No, you're not listening!

396
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,366
-Where's your passport?
-See, that's the problem!

397
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,864
ID. Identification.

398
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,937
Yes, well, I had my driver's license,
but I think I left it at the hotel.

399
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,663
Hey, hey, hey.

400
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,780
Let's go, let's go. Keep walking.
Don't look back. Don't look back.

401
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,392
What happened there, Osman?
What did you say to them?

402
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,458
I said I was your uncle
and you were a crazy person...

403
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,757
...like everyone from
the United States.

404
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,696
-Right?
-Great.

405
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,434
-What happened?
-I don't know.

406
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,300
Look, someone has taken my place.

407
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,943
It's this crazy, weird setup
or something.

408
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,204
My passport, my credit cards,
my bank accounts, everything.

409
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,279
Someone has taken me.

410
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,815
I always knew that trouble
was at this building.

411
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,317
Why? They....
They seemed fine.

412
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,253
Ivanakov.

413
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,187
-Ivanakov?
-Yeah.

414
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,691
Arms dealer. A Russian.

415
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,892
He's very bad man.

416
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,900
-A man with no soul.
-So he owns Galata?

417
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,435
I suggest you be careful.

418
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,607
Let's go.

419
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,143
-Where we are going now?
-Take me to Suzer.

420
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,923
-So you'll wait?
-Sure, of course.

421
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,694
Thanks, Osman.

422
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,423
If you weren't here,
I'd think I was going insane.

423
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,001
-All right. I'll be in the garage.
-Okay.

424
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,308
Bye, Osman.

425
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,780
Suzer International.

426
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,725
Hi, I'm here to see Hope Cassidy,
could you tell me where her office is?

427
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,765
I'm sorry, but I need your name.
Just a moment.

428
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,519
-Excuse me, can I help you?
-Not unless you have a gun.

429
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,354
Excuse me?

430
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,396
Z.Z.?

431
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,363
-Excuse me?
-What are you doing?

432
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,732
-Look, whoever you are--
-No, you know exactly who I am.

433
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,436
You're wearing my clothes!

434
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,165
I'm sorry, I really don't know
who you are.

435
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,038
I'm Hope!
Why are you impersonating me?

436
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,840
I called you at the hotel,
you never checked in.

437
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,778
Ok-- Okay.

438
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,078
Look, you can't be Hope,
because I'm Hope Cassidy, okay?

439
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,187
-Selim!
-Miss Cassidy?

440
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,119
-Yeah, we have a problem here.
-Hey, I saw that.

441
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,227
Look, I just wanna know why
you're screwing with me, okay?

442
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,297
-What do you want?
-What's all the talking about here?

443
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,266
Ali, thank God you're here. This crazy
woman, she just barged in here!

444
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,199
Ali, thank God.

445
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,238
-Who are you?
-I'm Hope Cassidy.

446
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,069
-Hope, what's going on?
-I don't know.

447
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,108
No, don't call her Hope!
She's a fake!

448
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,780
Z.Z., Kelly Roos.
Or God knows what her name is.

449
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,609
I'm Hope, okay?

450
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,583
She stole everything. My name,
my credit cards, my clothes.

451
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:02,085
Yesterday we had a conversation
and you wanted me to do a job.

452
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,319
-You called me--
-"The best, brightest, the cleverest."

453
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,997
No.

454
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,928
She must have tapped in on our call
or something.

455
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,967
You remember when you gave
me the job, what did I do?

456
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,639
I sent you roses.
I never sent a guy roses before.

457
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,104
-Yes.
-No, I told her that. I told you that!

458
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,174
You remember what else I said?

459
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:25,075
I said I needed to get my passport
straightened out. Remember? Right?

460
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,581
Hope Cassidy.
Do you have your passport?

461
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:28,979
No, that is--

462
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,588
This is crazy, okay?

463
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,759
I can prove to you that
I'm Hope Cassidy.

464
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,359
-The Galata job--
-Look, miss--

465
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,030
I can tell you access codes,
the security system.

466
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,698
-Security's on their way.
-Wait!

467
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,959
-Call the police as well, now!
-No, I have done nothing wrong!

468
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,262
Miss, you say you have
all the access codes.

469
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,439
-Exactly.
-We just had a call from Galata.

470
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,165
They are missing $1 4 million
out of their system.

471
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,174
-Oh, God!
-Stop her, stop her! Get Security!

472
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,677
Hey!

473
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,123
-Move!
-Hey!

474
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,428
Come on, come on, come on.

475
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,500
No!

476
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,205
Osman! Osman!

477
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,247
Osman! Come on,
we gotta go fast, okay?

478
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,646
I'll explain later. Come on, come on!

479
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,015
Osman! Come on.

480
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,539
Move!

481
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,642
Go, go!

482
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,528
What do you want from me?

483
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,108
Great, what else?

484
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,643
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

485
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,808
I can't believe this!

486
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,353
Hope this works.

487
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,954
Yes!

488
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,410
Sorry.

489
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,463
Okay.

490
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,064
Please pick up, pick up.

491
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,241
Hey, this is James,
leave me a message...

492
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,842
...and I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

493
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:05,379
James, it's me, Hope.
Please answer.

494
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,377
I'm in a lot of trouble.

495
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,485
You were right.
It's just gone so wrong.

496
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:17,821
I just really--
I really need your help right now.

497
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,226
Look, if you're there, could you
just please pick up, please?

498
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,025
James?

499
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,280
Look, I know this is difficult.

500
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,177
Do you?

501
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:43,044
Do you know what it feels like...

502
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:45,881
...to go an entire life...

503
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,115
...and realize that none of it matters?

504
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,293
That, basically, the person
you thought you were...

505
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,227
...doesn't exist?

506
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,008
Chai with cream.

507
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,374
Okay.

508
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,869
Oh, my God.

509
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,716
Hey, hey!

510
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,575
What did you do next?

511
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,344
What could I do?

512
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,280
I had no place to stay...

513
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,615
...no identity, very little money.

514
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,952
I had the police
and some Russian arms dealers...

515
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,959
...and God knows who else
were after me.

516
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,530
There was really only one place
that I could go...

517
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,327
...to find out why
this was happening to me.

518
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,931
Galata.

519
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,796
I thought it had very strong security.

520
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,135
I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

521
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,515
See, if I could get into their system...

522
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,051
...then I could find out
how they moved the money...

523
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,688
...and to where.

524
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,453
That would give me my start
to who these people were.

525
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,528
I knew that I would
have to work at night.

526
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,326
So the first problem
was how to get in.

527
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,866
-Galata Financial.
-Ibrahim Zoralan, please.

528
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,799
I'm afraid he has left for the day.

529
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,534
Can you hold for a second?
I'll see if I can get him on the phone.

530
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,845
I'm sorry, who am I speaking to?

531
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,216
Ibrahim Zoralan, who is this?

532
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,612
Gotcha.

533
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,464
Ibrahim Zoralan.

534
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,894
Ten minutes. This better work.

535
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,915
Damn it.

536
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,182
They changed the codes
after the break-in.

537
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,484
So, what did you do?

538
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,830
I did a probability search.

539
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:46,331
-A probability search?
-It's a surface program that I wrote.

540
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,231
I asked the computer to tell me...

541
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:51,930
...which keys are most probable
to be struck at a certain time.

542
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,737
For example, in the morning,
when they're accessing the system.

543
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,380
It could take a while...

544
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,914
...but I knew that it might be
my only chance.

545
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:16,425
Almost there, almost there.

546
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,123
Come on.

547
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,462
Yes! Okay, let's get started.

548
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,832
Fourteen million dollars,
where are you?

549
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,237
Where would you be?

550
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,471
Whoever did this set up
phony accounts...

551
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,309
...and moved them
over a dozen times...

552
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,418
...in order to cover up their tracks.

553
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,779
Finally making one mistake.

554
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,319
They put it in my name.

555
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,742
She's left the terminal.

556
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,582
I'm tracking her Pocket PC signal.

557
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:20,953
Attention, she's moving.
She's heading down the main hallway.

558
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,271
Yes, upstairs.

559
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,920
She's up here.

560
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,826
She's in the conference room.

561
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,820
Where did she go?

562
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,559
Where is my money?

563
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,340
Kelly Roos.
Find her before the police do.

564
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,412
The minute she gets on a computer,
she'll have a signature...

565
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:50,018
-...something that will give her away.
-We track her, then we kill her.

566
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:54,283
No. Bring her to me.

567
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,271
So you got the money?

568
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,104
No. Not yet, at least.

569
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,778
I knew I couldn't stay on the streets.

570
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,515
-I needed help.
-But you said you knew no one.

571
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,777
Not no one.

572
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,487
Roxelena.

573
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:03,853
-Oh, hey, Diana, the moon goddess.
-Yeah.

574
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,756
So you took my advice.
What do you think of Ortaköy?

575
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,329
I'm in trouble. I need your help.

576
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,597
Okay. Come.

577
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,067
We'll go to my place.

578
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:38,190
Hey, you hungry?
I have Turkish food.

579
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:43,229
-Very special, very famous.
-Yeah, that sounds great, I'm starved.

580
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,132
Here you are.

581
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,535
Hey, Roxelena,
I just wanted to say thanks.

582
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,637
I don't know what I would've done
if I hadn't found you.

583
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,177
Hey, maybe I found you.

584
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,308
It's no problem.

585
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,217
-I don't understand, Hope.
-I know.

586
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,894
This sounds crazy.

587
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,692
This sounds crazy.

588
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,698
And I don't expect you to believe me.

589
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,332
You know what? I want to.

590
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,936
-Are you able to get on the Internet?
-Okay, here we go.

591
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,349
Oh, my God.

592
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:46,960
-What is in the bottom of that?
-The grounds. Don't drink them.

593
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,961
God.

594
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:50,863
Here, look.

595
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,297
-Put the saucer on top of it, okay?
-Okay.

596
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,566
-I can tell your fortune.
-Really?

597
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,368
Now turn it upside down.

598
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,579
-Okay.
-Yes.

599
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,610
-Okay, now what happens?
-Wait.

600
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,290
Americans are always in
so much of a hurry.

601
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:20,156
Yeah, well, it happens
when people are trying to kill you.

602
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,662
I just don't understand any of this,
you know.

603
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,698
The cops are after you...

604
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,836
...they stole the money
that you didn't take...

605
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,630
-...but now you're gonna try and steal--
-Borrow.

606
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,743
-Borrow the money back.
-Okay, borrow.

607
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,947
How do you even expect
to get it out?

608
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,945
Well, they used my name
for the bank account.

609
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,652
-Hope Cassidy.
-That is my name.

610
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:47,220
So, basically,
I'm just gonna re-create myself.

611
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,782
Come here, sit down and watch.

612
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,596
See, that's the president
of the bank...

613
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,266
...Abdul Hamit,
and that is his e-mail address.

614
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,992
We can bounce an e-mail
to the local bank from his account...

615
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,365
...to make it look like
it came from him.

616
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,131
So here we go.

617
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,176
"To all, I would like to make sure
that everyone extends...

618
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,875
...the greatest hospitality to one of
our most-favored American clients."

619
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,110
-Hope Cassidy.
-Exactly.

620
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,151
"She will be visiting tomorrow.

621
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,620
Please ensure
her transaction requests...

622
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,123
...are handled smoothly
and efficiently.

623
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:28,194
Best regards, Abdul Hamit."

624
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,465
It's in English.

625
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,396
Yes, but....

626
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,001
There you go.

627
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,504
Will they let you in without ID?

628
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,409
No. But I thought of that too.

629
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,910
We do a search for an image of him.

630
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,209
See?

631
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:51,511
All right, watch.

632
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,220
And now you just print it out.

633
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,094
Brilliant.

634
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:02,388
You're a genius.

635
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,436
Anyway...

636
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,704
...what's my fortune?

637
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,604
-Duck!
-No!

638
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,519
Hope, run! Run!

639
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,873
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?

640
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,689
Roxelena...

641
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,950
...it's okay. Listen. Listen to me.

642
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,689
I am so sorry, but we have to get out
of here. We have no time, all right?

643
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,456
Do you have somewhere
you can go until this is over?

644
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,667
-Yes.
-I want you to go, okay?

645
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,804
What you gonna do?

646
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,031
Fight back.

647
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,115
We sent the police to the apartment.

648
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:14,353
They did not find the body.
No sign of a struggle.

649
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,131
But he was there when I left.

650
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,199
Nothing. Like it never happened.

651
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,332
And where is Roxelena now?

652
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:26,305
I don't know.

653
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,204
-I told her to--
-Vanish.

654
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,969
Very convenient.

655
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,342
You know what?

656
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,576
I was scared...

657
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,847
...and I was concerned for her and
I wasn't thinking about my damn alibi.

658
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:46,323
Now, I'm sure you and your guys
out there can find her.

659
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:49,895
The airline has no record
of her working there.

660
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,564
If you could tell me her last name....

661
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:58,001
How many people do you pass in life
and you don't know their last name?

662
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,541
-Or any name at all?
-This woman could be your only hope.

663
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,881
You think I'm making
this whole thing up.

664
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,266
-Do you speak English?
-Yes.

665
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,803
My name's Hope Cassidy.
I believe Mr. Hamit said I was coming?

666
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,309
It's a pleasure to have you here.

667
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:38,906
-Simit?
-No, thank you.

668
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,114
Chai?

669
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,754
Mr. Hamit has spoken greatly
about you.

670
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,616
-Thank you.
-How may I help you?

671
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:52,554
-Here is my account number.
-Yes.

672
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,458
I would like to move all my money
into a new account...

673
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,792
...and purchase Turkish bonds
for security.

674
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,763
This, of course, is no problem.

675
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,997
How much would you like
to purchase?

676
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,469
It's all written down there.

677
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,411
Yes. Certainly, yes.

678
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,740
-Is there a problem? Abdul told me--
-No, no.

679
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:16,349
No problem.
But there will be a fee.

680
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,421
-Which I am more than happy to pay.
-Yes.

681
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,616
Of course.

682
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,055
And, you see, we may need
some form of identification.

683
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,561
Of course, yes, l--

684
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:34,201
I'm sorry. Could you please give that
to Mr. Hamit next time you see him?

685
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,068
Yes. Of course.

686
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,374
Now then,
should we start the paperwork?

687
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,806
-Absolutely.
-Yes.

688
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,210
I have your money. I'll trade you.

689
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,644
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

690
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,787
Fourteen million.
I'll trade for my life.

691
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,689
-That's it, no questions asked.
-I really don't know what you mean.

692
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:03,294
I either get my life back or
let the Russian arms dealers...

693
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,193
...know where it is and who took it.

694
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,803
-Arms dealers?
-Yeah. Not nice people.

695
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,199
Especially when it comes
to stolen money.

696
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,675
-You're not serious.
-I'm dead serious.

697
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,745
-You have to understand. I haven't--
-You took my life away.

698
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,417
-I thought that I was helping.
-Helping who?

699
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:29,352
I don't know. They said that
this wouldn't be dangerous.

700
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:33,153
Who said? Z.Z., who said?
Who is doing this?

701
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,854
I was in jail, this guy came and said he
was from the American Embassy.

702
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,728
He said, "Trust me. I'll turn
this nightmare of yours into a dream."

703
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:44,065
-That's what he told me.
-Okay, so they used you.

704
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,168
They used me.

705
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,868
Okay, we're in this together.
So please tell me who's behind this.

706
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,208
Okay, look, we'll make a change,
just come to the office.

707
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,419
My terms.
The Süleymaniye Mosque, 6 p.m.

708
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,229
Z.Z.

709
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,594
Z.Z.

710
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,412
Z.Z.

711
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,357
Z.Z.

712
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,455
Look, I'm just here to make a deal.
You can have it all...

713
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,094
...I just want my li--

714
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,261
Oh, God. Oh, God, Z.Z.

715
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,367
Z.Z.

716
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,009
No, no!

717
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,242
I didn't do it, okay?
I didn't do it!

718
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,352
And now I'm here.

719
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,389
That was everyone you met?

720
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,990
Yes.

721
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,165
No one else who could
verify your story...

722
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,338
...vouch for you?

723
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,367
No.

724
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,810
So?

725
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,550
Yes?

726
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,483
So you believe me.

727
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,056
You believe that I'm Hope Cassidy.

728
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:18,424
I believe that you believe
you're Hope Cassidy.

729
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,229
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Guardians!

730
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,833
-I cannot believe you!
-Guardians!

731
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,866
Why have you done this to me?

732
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,902
You've kept me locked in here
for days.

733
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,371
And you haven't listened
to a word I've said.

734
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,443
-Let go of me! Oh, I hate you!
-There is no evidence...

735
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,082
...to support what you say. There's
no record that you're Hope Cassidy.

736
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,578
No, I explained that.

737
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,219
You had the knife
that killed Hope Cassidy.

738
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,185
No! That was not me!
That was Z.Z., okay?

739
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,085
I was trying to save her.

740
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,920
I'm Hope Cassidy!
I'm Hope Cassidy!

741
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:57,121
Why won't you listen to me?
Someone has to know me!

742
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,561
Oh, no!

743
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,099
Please.

744
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,897
You have no proof
of any of your story.

745
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,075
No, I have proof.

746
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,902
The money. I can tell you where it is.

747
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,876
Does anyone else know where it is?

748
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,049
-No.
-Good.

749
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,378
It may be the only thing that will
buy you off the death penalty.

750
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,251
This is your last hope.

751
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,231
Hope.

752
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,498
Hope.

753
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,397
Hope.

754
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,502
Hope.

755
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,665
Hope, sweetie, wake up.

756
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,672
Hope.

757
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,971
You okay?

758
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,843
God. James.

759
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,848
Come here.

760
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,456
I can't believe it.

761
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,693
You're here.

762
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:38,195
-You're here.
-I'm here, Hope.

763
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:42,201
I've never been so happy to hear
someone say my name.

764
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:45,835
What are you doing here?
How did you even find me?

765
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,531
I've been here for days.

766
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,973
I looked at the hotel,
but you checked out.

767
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,874
I even looked at the morgue.

768
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,947
-You won't believe what's going on.
-I heard, they told me.

769
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,515
At the police station.

770
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,845
-They had me in--
-Jail, I know.

771
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,819
Once I was able to verify your identity,
they were all so embarrassed.

772
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,993
I made a quick, angry phone call
to the embassy...

773
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:10,528
...I had you out in seconds flat.
You don't remember any of this?

774
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:16,228
Some things. Little bits, I guess.

775
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,735
-Where are my clothes?
-Your clothes are trashed.

776
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,909
I ordered new ones,
they'll be here soon.

777
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,839
-Thank you.
-Anything else...

778
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:28,410
...we put in this.

779
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,585
-What the heck is that?
-It's my evil-eye bracelet.

780
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,087
It wards off bad luck.

781
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,556
I think you might wanna
check those batteries.

782
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,628
I can't wait to get out of this city
and go home.

783
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,958
First flight out tomorrow morning.

784
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,434
Oh, I can't believe this is almost over.
I'm so happy.

785
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,198
I gotta run over to the embassy
before it closes...

786
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,240
...to do some paperwork
before we leave.

787
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,572
-No, please don't go.
-Well, I'll be back in less than an hour.

788
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,249
You're gonna be fine,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

789
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,445
Police even have a guard
outside the door.

790
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,546
Tomorrow morning
we leave for Los Angeles. All right?

791
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,054
All right.

792
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:14,558
Trust me. I'll turn this nightmare
of yours into a dream.

793
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,170
I was in jail and--

794
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,737
This guy said he was from
the American Embassy.

795
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,967
He said, "Trust me, I'll turn this
nightmare of yours into a dream."

796
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,508
Okay. Okay.

797
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,730
Who are you? Who are you?

798
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,991
Come on, tell me who you are.

799
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,637
Who are you working for?

800
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,543
Hello, Hope.

801
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,341
Let him go.

802
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,641
-No.
-I said, let him go.

803
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:17,249
No!

804
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,650
Let's go.

805
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,759
You were in on this
from the beginning?

806
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,296
Who do you think gave Suzer
your recommendations?

807
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,367
You were good, but we had
to get them to hire you.

808
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,935
You set me up!

809
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,933
This all could have been so easy,
you know.

810
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,840
Easy? Easy for who?

811
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,447
You just had to
leave the money alone.

812
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,276
You stole my life.
People were trying to kill me.

813
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,311
Hey, we all had to make sacrifices.

814
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:57,582
I had to pretend I was in love with you.
There're some perks I am gonna miss.

815
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,488
That was the problem with you
from the start.

816
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,892
You never appreciated what you had.

817
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,294
-Why me?
-Why you? Because we could.

818
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:11,472
No parents, no friends, no life. No one
would miss you when you were gone.

819
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,301
Hey, you wanted adventure.
Well, you got it.

820
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:16,568
You could have
stolen the money yourself.

821
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:19,508
From Russian gunrunners?
We'd never live to see any of it.

822
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,478
No, we needed a patsy,
somebody expendable.

823
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,125
Hope!

824
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:43,738
Shit.

825
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,656
What?

826
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,018
Open the door!

827
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,634
Who are you?

828
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:19,738
I'm an intelligence officer for Interpol.
Computer Crimes Division.

829
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,172
We've been tracking
your boyfriend, James...

830
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,402
...whose real name is
David Thompson...

831
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,639
-...and Dr. Kavak for years.
-Kavak's involved too?

832
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,817
She's a cop gone bad.

833
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,517
The money.

834
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,523
I can tell you where it is.

835
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,557
-Does anyone else know where it is?
-No.

836
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,096
So, what do you want with me?

837
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,561
We left you alone too long.

838
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,401
It's not safe anymore.

839
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,572
-Not safe anymore?
-Time to bring you in.

840
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,708
So you bring me in,
and for the rest of my life I'm running...

841
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,105
...looking over my shoulder?
I don't think so.

842
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,177
You haven't got a choice.

843
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,414
Yes, I do.

844
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,244
They wanna go to the bank,
get the money?

845
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,556
I say we let them get it.

846
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:14,725
I had her. The bitch pulled me
down the stairs.

847
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,265
-No. No-- Hold on.
-No!

848
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,903
Take it easy.
Calm down, calm down.

849
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,906
Don't do anything stupid.

850
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,909
-Where are you taking me?
-I think you know where.

851
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,979
You're gonna kill me
after you get the money?

852
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,918
Oh, it's not that simple.

853
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,821
Once I get my money,
you're free to do whatever you want.

854
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,461
But as long as you're alive...

855
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,656
...I don't think those Russians
are gonna forget about you. Do you?

856
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:57,667
Kavak?

857
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,507
-Didn't know you made house calls.
-Bank opens in five. Let's go.

858
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:04,975
-And here I thought you were the boss.
-Come on.

859
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,581
Look, can I go to the bathroom?

860
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:15,951
-I've been sitting in a car all night.
-No. You stay in our sights.

861
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,951
I can cause quite a scene.

862
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,187
It's fine. I'll go with her.

863
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,963
Wait, wait, wait.

864
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,472
Okay.

865
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,508
Leave the door open.

866
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,444
You've taken everything else I have,
how about leaving me a bit of dignity?

867
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,413
All right.

868
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,961
Come on, we haven't got all day.

869
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,466
I'm coming. Hold on.

870
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,910
-Done?
-I'd just like to wash my hands.

871
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,875
Let's get the money.

872
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:26,255
Hi. I would like to go
to my safety-deposit box.

873
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,157
Yes, of course. Come with me.

874
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:37,768
-I'm sorry, ma'am, box holders only.
-Of course.

875
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,342
Don't worry, I just want this thing
to be over.

876
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,977
Here she is.

877
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:23,208
I drop the bag in the car
and then I'm walking. I'm done.

878
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:26,581
You do as we tell you.
We count the money first.

879
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,334
Get off of me!

880
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:46,774
Let me go!

881
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:52,102
Get off of me!

882
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,079
Who the hell are you?

883
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,177
You took our money.

884
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,792
Get off of me!

885
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,206
Who has the money?

886
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,181
-You are?
-Hope Cassidy.

887
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,478
-And you are?
-Kelly Roos.

888
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,748
Kelly Roos.

889
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,151
It seems you took
a great deal of my money.

890
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,151
You can have it back.

891
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:18,162
-And then I let you go?
-Something like that.

892
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:21,199
You can keep the doctor
and her boy toy if you'd like.

893
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,564
It doesn't work that way.

894
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:25,599
Who would respect me?

895
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:29,402
How could I do business
if I was so generous?

896
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:39,016
I'll let you pick who goes first.

897
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:41,347
-No, look, we don't have to do this.
-Choose.

898
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:43,285
-We can talk about this.
-Choose.

899
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:45,583
-Choose!
-No, this doesn't have to happen!

900
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,727
Choose!

901
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,906
How the hell did you even find us?

902
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:51,313
Sometimes you just
have to have hope.

903
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,578
A lot of good it did her.

904
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,397
Captain...

905
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,176
...thank you for your help.

906
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,745
Anytime. You can ride
in the ambulance if you'd like.

907
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,574
I really should.

908
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:58,583
-Can I get up yet?
-Yes, you are safe.

909
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:02,886
It's not easy being dead.

910
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:06,150
The only way they wouldn't
come looking for you.

911
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:09,588
I was panicked this wouldn't work.

912
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,998
Come on, we haven't got all day.

913
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,270
Here, put this on.

914
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,679
You know...

915
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,445
...I was wondering.

916
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:38,990
-How did you find me at the hotel?
-We knew where you were at all times.

917
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:42,491
Hey, why do you think
I gave it to you?

918
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:07,680
So this whole thing was a setup
from the beginning.

919
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,686
I told you on the plane...

920
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,553
...nothing is ever
as it seems in Istanbul.

921
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,722
-You could have told me something.
-I did.

922
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,195
At the appropriate time.

923
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:25,335
Here you go.
New passport and new name.

924
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,309
You remembered.

925
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,512
And some money and clothes
to get you started.

926
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:38,514
So will it ever be safe
to go back to being me?

927
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,586
Not until we know how far-reaching
the organization is.

928
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,555
Even then....

929
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:48,656
That's all right. I was getting
a little tired of being me.

930
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,260
By the way...

931
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,560
...all of the money burned in the car
with Ivanakov...

932
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,170
...that was all the money, wasn't it?

933
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,167
Here I thought
we trusted each other.

934
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,502
I had to ask.

935
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,591
Do you think we can trust her?

936
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,797
We have to.

937
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,364
We may need her again.
