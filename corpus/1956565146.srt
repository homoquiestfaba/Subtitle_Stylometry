1
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,202
How's it looking?

2
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,571
Signal's getting strength.

3
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,340
Looks like she's homing in.

4
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,316
What are we gonna do with Iris
One after we win the war on drugs?

5
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,619
It's a highly versatile system,

6
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,421
I'm sure it'll be
put to good use.

7
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,925
Now, let's not get ahead of
ourselves here, gentlemen.

8
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,731
Never underestimate
my boys, Ross.

9
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,332
I guarantee you.

10
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,469
Delta will give Salvatore a
blow he'll not soon forget.

11
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,504
Either that...

12
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:56,276
or they'll end up like the two
DEA teams before them, Norm.

13
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,278
What are you
talking about, Alan?

14
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,648
Well, ask Jensen there.

15
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,681
He oversaw the ops.

16
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,355
Is it true?

17
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,494
Why was I not made aware of it?

18
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,596
A decision was made
to deny any knowledge.

19
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,899
Cut the disclaimer
horseshit, Jensen!

20
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,968
Is it true what Alan was saying?

21
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,269
Two teams?

22
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,305
12 men each.

23
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,742
So you're telling me that 24 men have
died attempting the same mission?

24
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,477
I'm afraid so.

25
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,061
Captain, I just wanna say
I think we got no business...

26
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,554
Hutch! Not now!

27
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,370
She's homing in.

28
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,403
Bingo.

29
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,741
Tell the guys we got a 909er.

30
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,744
Ability base, this is river rat.

31
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,613
We've got a confirmed
target lock.

32
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,715
Repeat.
Confirmed target lock.

33
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,852
Americanos!

34
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,520
Captain, talk to me!

35
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,554
Get us to the other side!

36
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,164
Vengas! Rapido!

37
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,383
Nobility Base,

38
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,552
we're ground zero
and closing on target.

39
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Where the hell they all go?

40
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,157
Go! Go! Go!

41
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,001
Go! Go!

42
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,677
Come on! Come on!

43
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,036
Come on!

44
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,686
Clear!
Move out!

45
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,157
Move up!

46
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,959
Hell of a party, fellas?

47
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,227
We like it, Cap!

48
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,895
Lombi, take point!

49
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,297
Lombi, take point.
Right, Cap!

50
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,432
Lombi!

51
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,734
Say "happy."

52
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,868
Happy.

53
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,070
Lombi!

54
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,104
Say "birthday."

55
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,175
Right, Cap.

56
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,245
Let's do it.

57
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,914
It's time to rock and roll!

58
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,742
Watch your step, Doc.

59
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,511
Don't worry about me.

60
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,479
Just keep your eyes open.

61
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,415
Clear.

62
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,283
Pretty clean, Cap.

63
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,853
Guess Salvatore never figured
anyone would make it this far.

64
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,462
What?

65
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,799
Shit.

66
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,002
Lombardi, move!

67
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,871
Move! Move!

68
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,440
Move!

69
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,473
Fuck!

70
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,314
Cap!

71
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,882
Shit!

72
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,151
Lombardi!

73
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,954
Lombi's down, Cap.

74
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,035
Okay.

75
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,972
Move! Move! Move! Move!

76
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,309
Go! Go!

77
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,815
This is not good, Cap.
This is not good.

78
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,849
Give all you got, Doc.

79
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,255
Come on, baby.

80
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,024
You give me all you got, Doc.

81
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,058
I want all you got!

82
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,396
Clear! Clear!

83
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,565
Go!

84
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,240
You gotta stay with me.

85
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,075
You gotta stay with me, okay?

86
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,143
Stay with me.

87
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,411
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

88
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,016
Clear.

89
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,624
Pay dirt.

90
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,594
Man, this is
a cokehead's wet dream.

91
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,628
Not for long, it ain't.

92
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,868
Hutch, why's it so
damn quiet out there?

93
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,337
Nothing left to kill, Captain.

94
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,371
Job well done.

95
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,411
Stay with me, okay?

96
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,946
Talk to me.

97
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,548
You're gonna talk to me.

98
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,882
Let's talk about Becky, okay?

99
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,983
Talk to me about Becky.

100
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,052
Stay with me.
You gotta talk to me.

101
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,617
Skip!

102
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,626
Nice toss, Cap.

103
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,161
Come on, Mac, set the timer.

104
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,529
Let's get the hell out of here!

105
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,562
Come on, fucker!

106
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,667
Let's get out of here.

107
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,701
Let's go!

108
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,246
Americans? Sí.

109
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,215
Do they know who
they're dealing with here?

110
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,285
Because, I mean,
this is... you know?

111
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,621
This is a fucking insult, man.

112
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,389
They insult me!
They insult my family!

113
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,258
Find out how they knew
and find out now!

114
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,291
Sí.

115
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,101
One comma 8 billion.

116
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,402
Stupid fucks!

117
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,738
Who the fuck do they think
they're dealing with?

118
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,576
You just got yourselves a war!

119
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,381
The world has been
led to speculate

120
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,183
on the details of the raid

121
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,186
which reportedly destroyed
a stockpile of cocaine

122
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:31,623
with an estimated
street value of $1.6 billion.

123
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,059
It's rumored, however,
that President Farrington

124
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,597
will address the issue in his keynote
speech at the U.N. later this week.

125
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,630
In other news...

126
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,069
War on drugs.

127
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,672
Right.
What a fucking joke.

128
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,574
What's the problem, Hutch?

129
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,782
Captain, this is not our fight.

130
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,254
When have we ever been able
to pick our own fights?

131
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,689
Come on, Cap!

132
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,225
War on drugs?

133
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,498
We are just pissing in the wind.

134
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,600
That's what burns me.

135
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,633
What you talking about, Mac?

136
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:22,474
He's talking about Lombardi in
there, fighting for his life.

137
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,809
Why?

138
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,512
Why? For what?

139
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,782
Because some fat-ass bureaucrat

140
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,517
decided that fighting drugs

141
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,387
is the fucking flavor
of the goddamn month!

142
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,890
You wanna know
what the bottom line is?

143
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,759
That until you start writing
the checks or calling the shots,

144
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,563
you're under complete and total
obligation to follow orders, period!

145
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,303
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

146
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,173
There's been no change.

147
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,687
Me? I don't know shit
about satellites.

148
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,156
But I got someone who does.

149
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,258
I'm known as a hacker.

150
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,562
I'm wanted by the FBI,
the CIA, Interpol,

151
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,564
Mossad, the Russians,
the French,

152
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,566
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

153
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
Wanted for what?

154
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,670
Cyber theft.

155
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,409
I steal codes.
Burgle information.

156
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,545
You know, all with
Mable's help, of course.

157
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,379
Welcome to the Nineties,

158
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,950
my technologically
challenged friends!

159
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,619
The world is computerized...

160
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,654
and it's all at my fingertips.

161
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,792
Stocks, bonds, utilities,
insurances, communication,

162
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,627
even the military.

163
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,464
If it's networked,
it's accessible.

164
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,800
With a few exceptions,
of course.

165
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,838
Once I'm in,
people like Sal pay me to observe,

166
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,508
to manipulate, to sabotage.

167
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,976
Now, a couple days ago,

168
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,679
Sal came to me with
this problem of yours.

169
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,818
And here it is in all its glory.

170
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,888
The Iris One constellation.

171
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,690
Say hello to the American
navy's finest, gents.

172
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,492
The U.S.S. Roosevelt,

173
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,228
the first in
a brand-spanking-new class

174
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,864
of ultra-quiet attack subs.

175
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,600
Ultra-quiet attack subs.

176
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,535
Why are you showing us this?

177
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,737
What do the subs
have to do with satellites?

178
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,770
Chill!

179
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,276
I was getting to that.

180
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,646
You see,

181
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,916
the Navy talks to its subs

182
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:49,354
via another satellite
network known as the SSIX.

183
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,524
Mable and I have cracked
the SSIX, gents,

184
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,558
which means
I can talk to the subs.

185
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,035

Z08375...

187
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:25,691
from com sub...

188
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:30,295
to
U.S.S Roosevelt...

189
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,831
one...

190
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:38,737
emergency test...
low... system..

191
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,744
Mr. Wallcox.
Sir.

192
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,814
A possible defect in workmanship

193
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,483
of the valves
in the emergency system?

194
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,987
"Please test the system immediately
and report any anomalies."

195
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,888
That's what it says,
Mr. Wallcox,

196
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,490
so I suggest we get to it.

197
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,492
And if there is a problem,

198
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:05,430
don't you think it would be
better to know sooner than later?

199
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,899
Okay, flood the tanks
so we can get on with this.

200
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,933
Captain.
Yes, sir.

201
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,535
Standby to flood the tanks!

202
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,912
All hands, this is the Captain.

203
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,782
We've been ordered to perform
an emergency blow drill,

204
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,618
to test for a possible
defect of the system.

205
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,420
Batten the hatches, men.

206
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,490
We're taking the express
elevator to the roof.

207
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,893
The drill will commence when
all sections are reported in.

208
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,061
Captain out.

209
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,631
Surface preparation!
Prepare to surface!

210
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,800
Prepare to surface!

211
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,876
Come on!

212
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,885
Come on!

213
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,020
You're behind on your drill!
Let's go!

214
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,054
Come on!

215
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,239
Chemical clear.

216
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,252
Sub is secure.

217
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,588
Forward-weapons hatch open.

218
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,739
Sal, you got yourself a sub.

219
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,576
How long before the
equipment's up and running?

220
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,778
8 hours, more or less,

221
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,147
if the guys know
what they're doing.

222
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,583
They know how.

223
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,020
Believe me, they know.

224
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,996
How many hours overdue\is
the transmission?

225
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,997
24.

226
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,064
Theories?

227
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,667
Well, she wend down.
She was torpedoed.

228
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,735
If she's on the bottom,

229
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,836
it'll take weeks to find her.

230
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,738
For God sakes, we're not at war!

231
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,771
At least not yet.

232
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,378
Lombardi's dead.

233
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,781
Cap called.
He died half an hour ago.

234
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,183
Jesus, Paul.
I'm so sorry.

235
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,953
I told him to go.

236
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,756
We were at the top
of these stairs...

237
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,158
and I told him to go first.

238
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,894
And then I saw
the laser tap him,

239
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,095
and I told him to move...

240
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,398
and he fucking froze.

241
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:10,001
I told him to fucking
move, and he froze.

242
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,202
Honey, you did
everything you could.

243
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,904
This wasn't your fault.

244
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,940
Maybe Mac's right.

245
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:18,176
Maybe this isn't our war.

246
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,209
But right now,
you know what I want?

247
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,784
I want him dead.

248
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,987
I don't care if they
legalize drugs or they don't.

249
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,390
I want Humberto Salvatore dead.

250
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,994
God, it's Frank.

251
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,329
What the hell?

252
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,831
This is Humberto Salvatore

253
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,868
using live pictures from the U.S.S.
Roosevelt.

254
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,771
Surely you've been wondering
what happened to the sub.

255
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,375
Well, wonder no more.
It's mine.

256
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,243
Get me a VPA now!

257
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,713
If it is him,
he's got to be bluffing.

258
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,415
Then how in hell did he
know the sub's gone missing?

259
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,985
He's got to be
staging this somehow.

260
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,886
It's just not possible.

261
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,156
My men have already replaced
the conventional warheads

262
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,958
on the sub's cruise missiles

263
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,127
with warheads containing
mustard gas.

264
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,462
I have the ability to strike

265
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,998
at any four cities
on the eastern seaboard

266
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,966
from the sub's current position.

267
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,369
My people tell me
that you can push a button

268
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,872
that will destroy your eyes in the
sky, Iris One.

269
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,975
I give you 24 hours
to push that button,

270
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,243
or I'll push mine.

271
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,046
Your only choice is
to decide what you lose...

272
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,716
A few satellites
or millions of innocent lives.

273
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,421
You wanted a war.
You got one.

274
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,454
I'll be in touch.

275
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,160
Come on.

276
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,995
He's got to be
bluffing about that.

277
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,965
Would you take a chance
on that, Ted? Would you?

278
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,800
If we nuke it, it won't matter

279
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,168
whether or not he's bluffing.

280
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,303
If he's on the open sea, sure.

281
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:57,342
But what if he's parked 25
miles off the coast of D.C.?

282
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,780
Okay, what have we got here?

283
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,215
We've got the quietest
sub in the world

284
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,751
poised to strike
the eastern seaboard

285
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,254
with chemical weapons.

286
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,222
What I want to know is,

287
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,192
what the hell are we
gonna do about it?

288
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,999
Skip Lang.

289
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,201
Skip. Norm Henshaw here.

290
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,304
If you and the boys are up for
another crack at Salvatore,

291
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,173
we've got a real situation here.

292
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,775
We've decided to strike
directly at him.

293
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,779
Unfortunately there's no time to
mobilize and deploy a large force.

294
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,116
Naturally, your unit was
at the top of the list.

295
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,906
No, I will be honored
to cooperate

296
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,109
in every way posible, Señor, sí.

297
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,245
And I give you
my personal guarantee

298
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,581
that everything will
go smoothly, sir.

299
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:20,018
The President is very,
very grateful personally,

300
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,920
and buenas noches.

301
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,953
Thank you. Good-bye.

302
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,026
Borrega assures me
everything will be in place

303
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,427
for Operation Trap

304
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,563
by the time Delta arrives.

305
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,434
Norm, this is my protégé,
Ariana Decker.

306
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,037
She helped me design
and install the safeguards

307
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,438
for the Iris One network.

308
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:44,676
She also had a hand in the computer
enhancements on the Roosevelt.

309
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,645
Captain, too bad you
weren't around

310
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,113
to help with the SSIX.

311
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,449
Well, we're pretty sure we know

312
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,952
who Salvatore's
point man was on that.

313
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,320
Here, let me show you.

314
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,353
Sure.

315
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,267
All right, gentlemen.

316
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,670
It's time we get
down to business.

317
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,976
As you know,
Salvatore's grubby fingers

318
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,478
reach into every nook and cranny

319
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,513
of the Colombian military.

320
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,415
So open communication to base

321
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,683
is out of the question.

322
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,319
Out of the question!

323
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,389
I know it's contrary
to standard procedure,

324
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,292
but that's the way that
this op's going down.

325
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,493
Any questions?

326
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:12,130
Where are we staging from?

327
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,532
It's a small town
called St. Crystal.

328
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,501
We'll ride a train in
across the tracks

329
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,534
into his territory.

330
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,006
Slip up under his nose.

331
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Kick him in the fucking teeth.

332
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,710
I love that.

333
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,189
Two.

334
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:42,060
Three. Kilo, kilo,
alpha, 9-1-4.

335
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,696
Three, kilo, kilo, alpha, 9-1-4.

336
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,697
Completed one.

337
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,598
All automation systems normal.

338
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,569
Bearing, 072.
Range, 44,000.

339
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,272
Automated systems
responding accordingly.

340
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,305
Turning.

341
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,156
Okay, gentlemen.

342
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,492
There are two phases to this op.

343
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,427
Phase one.

344
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,198
Infiltrate the compound,
locate the target.

345
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,666
Phase two.

346
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,402
Capture and/or eliminate
the target.

347
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,141
This will be our optimal
L.C. here.

348
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,478
As we cross the border,
it will be our secondary.

349
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,679
Any questions?

350
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,314
Captain.

351
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,684
We're approximately six
minutes away from the border.

352
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,754
Let's synchronize
our watches to 0700 hours

353
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:47,825
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

354
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,759
Hey, hombres. Venga.

355
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,230
Vayanse!

356
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,833
Vayanse!

357
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,503
Rapido!

358
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,537
Vamamos.

359
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,546
Rapido! Rapido!

360
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,485
Vamos.

361
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,518
Andele.

362
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,221
Rapido.

363
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,371
This is General Borrega.

364
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,508
Do you wish to purchase
any information?

365
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,277
Yes.

366
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,520
You sound like
a smart man, Admiral.

367
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,455
Everybody makes a mistake
from time to time.

368
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,689
That is human nature.

369
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,559
And yours was wasting your time
planning a strike against me

370
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,961
when you could have put
that time to better use

371
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,230
convincing your President
to destroy Iris One.

372
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,766
Speaking of time, Admiral,
it's ticking away.

373
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,936
You have eight hours
to get President Farrington

374
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,805
to pull the plug on Iris One.

375
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,809
Borrega.

376
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,851
I'd say we're looking up
a dead horse's rectum, Norm.

377
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,319
Yeah.

378
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,882
Cap, we got to get
this train moving, man.

379
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,489
Go, go, go!

380
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,879
Beggars, go airborne!

381
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,386
One in the hole.

382
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,104
Hutch, Vicks,
juice up the birds.

383
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,150
You all right?

384
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,552
Yeah, I'm fine.

385
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,653
Battery on.

386
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,821
Battery on.

387
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,556
Come on, Cap!

388
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:21,625
You get back here, goddamn it, Sparks!
That's an order!

389
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,893
Circuit breakers on.

390
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,929
Phase two, circuit breakers on.

391
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,173
Shit!

392
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,608
Fuel pump, check.

393
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,641
Fuel pump, check.

394
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,146
Adonde? Adonde?

395
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,179
Where are they?

396
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,517
Son of a bitch!

397
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,688
Hydraulics engaged.

398
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,125
Shit!

399
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,625
Let there be light.

400
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,606
Son of a bitch!

401
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,718
Aw, shit!

402
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,974
Sparks is hit!

403
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,575
Sparks!

404
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,609
We'll come get you in five.

405
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,225
It's coming around
1:00 high.

406
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,259
Got you covered.
Go, go, go!

407
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,332
Move it!

408
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,600
Take it up!

409
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,068
Going up.
Tango. Tango.

410
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,102
Son of a bitch!

411
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,073
Hurry, Cap!
Incoming!

412
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,107
We're coming!
We're coming!

413
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,188
Come on!

414
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:44,995
Get on!
Go!

415
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,029
We're gonna land
the thing over here.

416
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,385
Let's go.

417
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,762
Good work, guys.

418
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,297
That's definitely one
for the record books.

419
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,299
I think it's time we go rain

420
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,332
on Salvatore's parade.

421
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,352
Come to Thane.

422
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,954
He loves you, baby.

423
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,987
Thane loves you.

424
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,795
Yeah.

425
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,730
So, General Borrega,

426
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,764
tell me about the train.

427
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,036
So where are they now?

428
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,882
Jesus Christ!

429
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,089
Hurry up!

430
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,836
Get Thane.

431
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,872
Thane!

432
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,104
Hallway clear!

433
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,385
Hello, Howie.

434
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,888
Or is it HT.com-prick?

435
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,923
You got me mixed up
with someone else, man.

436
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,130
Over here, Cap.
What is it?

437
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:09,299
Hutch, Vickers,
download this punk.

438
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,333
Mac, Doc, come with me.

439
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,389
What the hell's
he doing down here?

440
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,260
Shit! The current!

441
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,295
Son of a bitch is headed
toward the river.

442
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,202
Hi, Howie.

443
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,175
I'm Hutch.
That's Vickers.

444
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,310
Hey.

445
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,343
I only have one question.

446
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,315
Where's the sub?

447
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,348
Watch the material, bub.

448
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,994
Hey.

449
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,902
See, I know that you
have a com link,

450
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,470
so I know you're
talking to the sub.

451
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,505
How?

452
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,040
Holy jeez.

453
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,073
You guys just really don't...

454
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,293
Don't make me ask you again.

455
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,031
You idiots.
Reload.

456
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,099
Don't shoot!

457
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,132
Don't shoot!

458
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,962
Howard!

459
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,230
Look at me.

460
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,399
Look at me.

461
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,135
Are you gonna give me
the answers I need?

462
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,404
Or am I gonna have
to convince you?

463
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,006
Hold on. I really...

464
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,340
I really don't know.

465
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,374
I really don't...

466
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,245
I can contact
the hijackers, okay?

467
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,413
Now we're getting somewhere.

468
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,248
Get your ass over there
and call 'em off.

469
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,317
It won't help.

470
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,654
They were only supposed to set
up the equipment and take over.

471
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,322
They're superfluous now.

472
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,491
Don't you patronize me.

473
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:51,695
What... do...
you... mean?

474
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,632
I designed the system

475
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,467
to completely automate the sub.

476
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,436
That's what Salvatore wanted.

477
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,371
So what would happen
if his demands were met?

478
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,773
Fuck, I don't know!

479
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,806
Fuck!

480
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:16,153
And I liked him.
Okay.

481
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,465
Shit!

482
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,738
I want you to tell me again.

483
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,242
The SSIX.

484
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,179
Only Salvatore knows the codes.

485
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,042
Where is the Roosevelt headed?

486
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,748
The hijackers were supposed to...

487
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:18,882
We know that!

488
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:22,219
He asked you where the
Roosevelt was headed.

489
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,824
Where's the sub?

490
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,261
Cap!
Cap!

491
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,468
So fucking close!

492
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:25,709
I take full responsibility
for Salvatore's escape.

493
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,552
At ease.
What's up?

494
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,988
We have a clear target, Captain.

495
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,489
Where?

496
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,358
The sub is headed
for New York City.

497
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,391
Shit!

498
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,328
Is that true, Thane?

499
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,362
Is that true?
It's true.

500
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,901
We're going airborne, gentlemen.

501
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,236
Get this loser out of here. Sir.

502
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,871
What the hell are you on?

503
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,640
Captain, we cannot
break radio silence.

504
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,241
I have to break protocol, Mac.

505
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,809
We have no choice.

506
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,879
Captain, listen... It's a
matter of national security!

507
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,781
Track leader to Nobility Base.

508
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,016
Track leader to Nobility Base.

509
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,049
Do you read?

510
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,428
Get up, goddamn it.

511
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,869
Come on in, Skip.
Let's hear it.

512
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:26,937
Admiral Henshaw.

513
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,273
We thwarted the ambush
on the train without incident,

514
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,043
but, Salvatore got away.

515
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,377
Shit!

516
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,379
However, we did grab Thane.

517
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,814
Did you get the code?

518
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,649
Negative.

519
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,385
And, sir,
it looks like the Roosevelt

520
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,553
is headed to New York City.

521
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,288
What?
New York City?

522
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,958
Okay, Skip, change of plan.

523
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:52,295
Rendezvous ASAP on board
the U.S.S. Coral Sea.

524
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,464
I'll update the President.

525
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,833
Nobility Base out.

526
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,803
Good to have you back, dude.

527
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,836
All over it, Cap.

528
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,984
Morning, Admiral. Joe.

529
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,686
Ten-Hut!

530
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,722
Take it easy, boys.
Carry on. Captain. Sir.

531
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:57,594
So this is our infamous
Mr. Howard Thane.

532
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,763
Yes, sir.
Howdy, Gramps.

533
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,931
Um...

534
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,701
I really need my medicine.

535
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,734
He's talking about these, sir.

536
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,006
We took 'em off
him at the villa.

537
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,076
Whatever they are, he's got
a pretty strong habit going.

538
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,783
Admiral.

539
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:25,055
Do we have any news from
the Roosevelt yet, sir?

540
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,824
She's on a holding pattern
up in New York Bay.

541
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,760
And our course of action?

542
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,463
Well, I've got to get
you boys on board, don't I.

543
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,499
You're wasting your time.

544
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,702
Even if you get past
those hijackers,

545
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,071
you're never gonna
override the program.

546
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,506
Get that thing out of here!

547
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,075
I want to talk to my lawyer!

548
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,576
I still got rights, you know.

549
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,145
I'm an American citizen
for Christ's sake!

550
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,716
Well, Captain, at least
we stand a chance

551
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,484
of finding the sub.

552
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,517
And then what, sir?

553
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,856
Look, I know Howard.

554
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,558
Maybe I can talk to him.

555
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,527
Maybe we should
think about evacuation.

556
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,696
Evacuating what, General?

557
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,699
Just 'cause the submarine's
heading for New York

558
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,635
doesn't mean New York's
the target.

559
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,877
Hey, Howard.

560
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,216
You're looking better than ever.

561
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,249
Wish I could say the same.

562
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,925
You said Salvatore's
the only one

563
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,229
who knows the code to remotely
access your automation system.

564
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,630
That's what I said.

565
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:43,533
What about overriding it
from inside the sub?

566
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,034
What about it?

567
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,604
Howard, don't be like that.

568
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,874
Help me and I'll help you.

569
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,242
How?

570
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,911
If you cooperate I can fix it

571
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,613
to where you're not
wearing a tutu

572
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,015
for some 300-pound
murderer named Spike.

573
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,484
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Ariana.

574
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,954
I look great in a tutu.

575
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,988
I bet you do.

576
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,226
Bet you'd like one of these

577
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,862
right about now,
wouldn't you, Howard.

578
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,164
What would you do with it?

579
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,900
Let it slowly dissolve
on your tongue?

580
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,839
No. Bet you'd chew it
to a fine paste

581
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:26,643
so it would get in your
bloodstream a little faster.

582
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:27,911
Like I said...

583
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:32,615
you help me and I'll help you.

584
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:40,790
Each major system
has its own program.

585
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,859
They can each be
shut down individually.

586
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,594
How?

587
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,627
By entering the right codes.

588
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,640
Can I please have my pills?

589
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,809
What do you got yourself
hooked on, Howard?

590
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,010
Painkillers?
Please.

591
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,044
Choke on 'em, Howard.

592
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,550
Very funny!

593
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,320
Screw you too,
you fucking bitch!

594
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,822
They're never gonna
mess with you assholes!

595
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,091
Never trust a fucking woman!

596
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:18,061
Especially one named Ariana.

597
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,233
Excellent work, Ariana.

598
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,801
Thank you, sir.

599
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,237
I'd like you to meet
Delta Team One.

600
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,339
Hello.

601
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:33,710
Captain, this is the unit that's
gonna get you on board that submarine.

602
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,044
What?

603
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:38,882
Marcus, I'm really
not ready for this.

604
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,250
One of us has to go.

605
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,951
The Navy may be building

606
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,586
quieter and quieter submarines,

607
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,988
but they're still not
equipping them

608
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,923
with wheelchair ramps.

609
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,858
You're the best person
for the job.

610
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,892
You know that.

611
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:18,087
DSRV bearing 2-4-0.

612
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:21,357
Roger that.
DSRV bearing 2-4-0.

613
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,033
Turbulence factor, 18 degrees.

614
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,669
Roger that.
Turbulence factor, 18 degrees.

615
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,142
Current, 30 degrees at 4 knots.

616
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,251
Contact. Do we
have contact?

617
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,284
Negative on contact.

618
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,706
Captain.

619
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,781
My God, she's a beast.

620
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:02,992
We have a hard seal.

621
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,026
Admiral, we are locked on.

622
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,197
Dree, check the escape hatch.

623
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,615
Dree, report.

624
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,552
Dree, report.

625
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,288
Dree, report.

626
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,265
They...

627
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,201
They gassed 'em, Cap.

628
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,932
H-8-M-2-6-9.

629
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,411
Chemicals negative.

630
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:45,615
Assume defensive series
8-3-5-L-Z.

631
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,214
Come on.

632
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,583
This ain't potpourri.

633
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,560
Make sure there's no heat-sensors,
booby traps, tripwire.

634
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,562
Doc, I need you to
link us up topside.

635
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:07,496
Yes, sir.

636
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,530
See anything, Hutch?

637
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:12,635
Negative on explosive
devices, Captain.

638
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,668
You all right?

639
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,471
Yeah.

640
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:28,517
Nobility Base, do you copy?
This is Team One. Over.

641
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,685
Got anything for me, Doc?

642
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,719
Nothing yet, Captain.

643
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,558
Captain.

644
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,795
One down.

645
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,468
Mac.

646
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,501
What the hell is this?

647
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,510
That's good-bye, New York.

648
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,748
In just under 30 minutes,
President Farrington

649
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,816
will stand before
the leaders of the world

650
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,385
and deliver the keynote speech

651
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,587
for the 1998 drug summit.

652
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,256
For days now, pundits
have been predicting

653
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,492
that the speech will
serve as a platform

654
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,160
for a major announcement.

655
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,496
But as has been the case
all week long,

656
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,798
no one in the White House
will even hint

657
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:18,300
at what the announcement
might be,

658
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,636
although this morning
a source promised

659
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,139
that it would be,
quote, history-making.

660
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,718
Captain.

661
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,124
What is it?

662
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,460
None of the codes
Thane gave us were accepted.

663
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,495
What!

664
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,731
Son of a bitch lied.
No!

665
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,699
I don't think he did.

666
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,536
Salvatore's hijackers
must have changed them.

667
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,671
Let's just trash
the freaking main-frame.

668
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:56,806
No!

669
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,707
I know how Thane works.

670
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,876
I'm sure he's incorporated
some safeguards

671
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,679
to make this whole system
sabotage-proof.

672
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,782
We have 28 minutes, gentlemen.

673
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,552
Mac, man the helm.

674
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,454
Sir.

675
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,622
Attempt a manual override.

676
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,425
Doc, what do you have for me?

677
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,426
Still got nothing.

678
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,594
Got to do better than that.

679
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:20,396
I need to speak with
Henshaw immediately.

680
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,430
Yes, sir.

681
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,398
Cap?

682
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,532
What's the problem?

683
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:24,834
We got nothing.

684
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:25,801
Hutch.
Sir.

685
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,170
Prepare the emergency blow system.
Yes, sir.

686
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,706
Everybody hold on.
We're going topside.

687
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,739
Brace yourself.

688
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,912
Ready to fly

689
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,683
in 3, 2, 1.

690
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,716
Blow.

691
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:44,787
Shit.

692
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,189
Hutch?

693
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,524
No response, Captain.

694
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,326
Let's go again.

695
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,460
Sir!

696
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,462
Okay?

697
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:58,767
In 3, 2, 1.

698
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,801
Blow!

699
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,237
She's wired!

700
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,610
Damn it, why am I not surprised?

701
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,944
Hutch, clear that passageway!

702
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,913
Yes, sir!

703
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,415
You okay?
You all right?

704
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,521
Nobility Base, this is Team One.

705
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,623
Do you copy? Over.
Come on.

706
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,658
Nothing, Captain.
Keep trying.

707
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,793
Nobility Base, this is Team One.

708
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:29,465
F1, shift. That will
reboot the system.

709
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,233
System's rebooting.

710
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,835
We have a frequency.

711
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:35,538
Nobility Base, do you copy?

712
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,006
This is Team One.
Over.

713
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:38,908
Admiral, they've
secured the cockpit.

714
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,609
You're on speaker.

715
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,412
This is Nobility Base, Captain.

716
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,747
You've shut the system down.

717
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,649
Negative, Admiral.

718
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,784
The codes weren't accepted.

719
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,020
The hijackers somehow transposed.

720
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,455
Thane's emergency
fail-safe sequence numbers.

721
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,456
Captain.

722
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,025
Can you at least
tell which cities

723
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,793
the missiles are targeting?

724
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,862
Negative, sir.

725
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,864
Ariana's trying to work
on that program now.

726
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:04,400
Prepare to fall-back
contingency.

727
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,401
Keep us posted.

728
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,036
Nobility Base out.

729
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,738
Hutch and Vickers,
move to weapons lockers.

730
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:12,274
See what you can do to
disengage the firing mechanism.

731
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:15,277
Mac and Doc.

732
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,812
Take care of Ariana.

733
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:18,845
Sir.

734
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,638
Cool.

735
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,677
Okay, baby, okay.

736
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,711
Talk to me.

737
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,383
The spheres... Son of a bitch,

738
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,951
the spheres Vickers
brought in, Cap,

739
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,753
I knew I'd seen 'em before.

740
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:58,921
In the Gulf.

741
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,323
So it is biological.

742
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,826
Yeah, sir.

743
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,861
Which means it'll be

744
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,696
an airborne virus

745
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,730
and it'll be deadly.

746
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,369
Can you guesstimate
the area of contamination?

747
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:16,605
Based on the size
of that sphere,

748
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:17,873
depending on how many there are,

749
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,876
I mean, I'd say we're looking at

750
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,646
Manhattan, minimum.

751
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,583
That's 10 million people, Hutch.

752
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,616
Dead people.

753
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,833
What the hell is this?

754
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,770
Cap, we got something.

755
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,938
What do you got, Mac?

756
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,043
Cap, it's right behind
the sonar now.

757
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,585
Son of a...

758
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,159
Confirmed.

759
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,096
Got a problem.

760
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,005
Hutch we got two in the bush.

761
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,038
You're flying solo on this one.

762
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,710
Great.

763
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,494
Vicks.

764
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,797
Mine's down.

765
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,672
Get down!

766
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,781
Come on.

767
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,251
Three down, Cap.

768
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,089
Fail-safe.

769
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:55,791
Fail-safe.

770
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,293
Ho, ho, you are clever.

771
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,327
You are...

772
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,090
What is that?

773
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,060
Sounds like the reactors
are swelling up.

774
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,197
We're accelerating.

775
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,965
How the hell
are we accelerating?

776
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,634
There's no one
driving this thing.

777
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,667
It's the codes.

778
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,764
Shit.

779
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,797
Now we're turning.

780
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,706
She's breaking
our holding pattern.

781
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,975
Maybe they got
control of the helm.

782
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:20,976
No, sir.

783
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:23,211
She's headed towards
the mouth of the East River.

784
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,318
What the hell's going on
in here, Mac?

785
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:30,886
Heck if I know, Cap.

786
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,421
Goddamn thing's driving itself.

787
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:34,323
Sparks.
Sir.

788
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,857
Contact Henshaw.

789
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:36,925
Yes, sir.

790
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:37,993
Vicks. Sir.

791
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,026
Scope up.
Yes, sir.

792
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:49,338
Nobility Base,
this is Team One. Over.

793
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:53,008
Roger, Admiral. You're on
speaker to Captain Lang.

794
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,776
This is Nobility Base, Captain.

795
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,045
Have you got
control of the helm?

796
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,080
Negative, sir.

797
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,281
At the moment we're belly-up

798
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:00,782
and on a guided tour.

799
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,684
You are heading
up the East River.

800
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:05,053
What?

801
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,688
Vicks?

802
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,390
Affirmative, sir.

803
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,423
Son of a bitch.

804
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,095
Salvatore's planning
on making a statement

805
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,830
at the international
drug summit.

806
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,365
What are you talking
about, Captain?

807
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:20,969
There's a biological bomb and three
Tomahawk missiles on board, sir,

808
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,003
all prepped and hot.

809
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,340
They're headed
for the U.N.

810
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:31,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

811
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:35,851
presidents, prime ministers,
it is with the utmost pleasure

812
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:42,090
that I stand before you today as
the bearer of remarkable news,

813
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:45,060
news of an historic
turning point

814
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,095
in the worldwide war on drugs.

815
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,174
We got the helm.

816
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,176
Vicks.
Sir.

817
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,512
Have we got enough water
to turn this baby around?

818
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,280
Yes, sir.
Hard to port, sir.

819
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,313
Hard to port!

820
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,287
Eight hundred.

821
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,856
Seven hundred.

822
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,259
Six hundred and closing.

823
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:28,403
I speak of a surveillance
satellite network

824
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,272
called Iris One...

825
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,407
Come on, come on, turn.

826
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:40,916
A network so sophisticated that
it will enable us to pinpoint

827
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,117
with great accuracy...

828
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,150
Two hundred.
She's starting to turn.

829
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:50,258
Even the smallest
amount of narcotics...

830
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,060
One fifty.
She's turning.

831
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:55,130
As the recent raid
on Humberto Salvatore...

832
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,331
She's turning.
Keep it hard.

833
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,432
Keep it hard over.

834
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,466
Hard over!

835
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,168
Convincingly demonstrated.

836
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,071
At 100.

837
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,907
Hold on.

838
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:11,947
Armed with this
potent new weapon...

839
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,822
We're clear, Captain!
We're clear! Clear!

840
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:25,994
Victory in the war
against drugs is ours.

841
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,599
Thank you, gentlemen.

842
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,168
Now for the bomb.

843
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,570
Give me good news, Hutch.

844
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,409
We've got a tanker dead ahead.

845
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,983
Can we avoid her?

846
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:50,016
It'll be tight.

847
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,539
Starboard!
Starboard!

848
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:45,574
Come on, baby.

849
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,607
Starboard, Mac, starboard!

850
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,138
Shit! Sons of bitches!

851
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,378
Damn it! Goddamn it!

852
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:37,357
Clear of the bridge.

853
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,327
Cap...

854
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,629
last phase is complete.

855
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:42,097
I don't have the codes

856
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:44,232
to access the trigger
mechanism, Cap.

857
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:45,567
I understand.

858
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,103
Cap, you got to tell her.

859
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,005
Tell her I need those codes.

860
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,373
You tell her I need those codes!

861
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,508
I understand.

862
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,377
Ariana.

863
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,213
Hutch said he can't
disconnect the last phase

864
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,514
until you give him the codes

865
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:01,547
for this triggering mechanism.

866
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:04,319
Cap, we got a problem.

867
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,021
This clock has gone crazy.

868
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,054
It's just jumped from 11 to 9.

869
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,462
There's too many codes.

870
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,031
The odds are against us!

871
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:16,998
Come on, Ariana.

872
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,733
You're better than that
doped-up little turd.

873
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,235
There's got to be something.

874
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,268
Seven minutes.

875
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,545
What the hell was that, Vicks?

876
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,578
Bottom side, sir.

877
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,818
Three minutes.

878
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,426
Come on!

879
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,027
Look, solider.

880
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,162
We have done our job.

881
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,097
You have got to get
in this guy's head.

882
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,565
You've got to think
like Thane thinks.

883
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,434
What motivates him?
What makes him tick?

884
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,235
Is it money, power, greed?

885
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:55,770
The dope? What is it,
goddamn it?

886
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,804
What is it?

887
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,540
Come on.

888
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:06,581
It's me.

889
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:08,614
Come on.

890
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,855
A.

891
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,326
R-I.

892
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,765
N.

893
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,169
A.

894
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,383
It was you.

895
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,621
Good work.

896
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,563
Hey, Cap.

897
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,365
Good God, Sergeant.

898
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,533
Yeah.

899
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:02,771
This sub, sir,
she's breaking up.

900
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:06,174
Vicks, I need a hand please.

901
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:17,585
Nobility Base, Nobility Base,
this is Team One.

902
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:20,188
We have a slight dilemma, sir.

903
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,857
Sub appears to be
taking on a lot of water.

904
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:26,294
We have, however, defused
the biological bomb,

905
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:30,198
but it appears we won't be
able to contain her speed.

906
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,800
She's runaway, sir.

907
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,802
Admiral Henshaw, sir.

908
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:38,773
Presently we are in
possession of eight spheres

909
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:43,178
of an airborne
biological virus, sir.

910
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,880
We have not had time
to defuse the Tomahawks.

911
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,650
Set your wheel to 3-5-3.

912
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:51,553
Your priority is to get those
chemicals off that vessel.

913
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:55,156
Abandon ship.
That is an order.

914
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,158
You heard 'em, people.
We're abandoning ship.

915
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:58,493
Set the course for 3-5-3.

916
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,526
Let's get the hell out of here.

917
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,932
3-5-3. Lock.

918
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:05,965
3-5-3, sir.

919
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,354
Pick it up, people.
We're running out of time.

920
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:33,695
Jesus Christ!

921
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:36,631
Let's just hope the DSRV's okay.

922
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,359
Goddamn it.

923
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:05,894
There's a major malfunction
in the seal.

924
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:06,895
What?

925
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:07,862
The coupling's cracked.

926
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:09,764
Must have happened when
we scraped the bridge.

927
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:11,566
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

928
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,968
Hull damage.

929
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,470
Mac, get the hell up here.

930
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,405
We're flooding the tanks.

931
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:18,306
Captain.

932
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:19,507
Mac, that's an order!

933
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,541
Get up here!
Captain!

934
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:23,244
What?

935
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:25,914
The coupling's shot.

936
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,716
We're not going anywhere.

937
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,750
We're all gonna die.

938
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:33,386
Unless what?

939
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:36,424
Feed my cat, Cap.

940
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,359
Mac!

941
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,331
He jammed it.

942
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,533
Whoa.

943
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,567
You got to order him
to get out now!

944
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,511
Skippy!

945
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,329
Finally I'm in.

946
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,699
Mac!

947
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:08,816
Mac!

948
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,718
Mac!

949
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,387
Mac!

950
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,420
Mac!

951
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:16,624
Mac!

952
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:18,658
Mac!

953
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,129
Mac!

954
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,145
Mac. Mac.

955
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,114
Mac.

956
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:15,083
Get him on his side, Cap.

957
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:15,983
Mac.

958
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,985
Keep his head down
and get him on his side.

959
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:19,754
Mac.

960
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:21,489
Come on, buddy.

961
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,522
Keep your head down.

962
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,231
Good job.

963
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:37,737
Hey, soldier.

964
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,509
What?

965
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,542
No mouth to mouth?
