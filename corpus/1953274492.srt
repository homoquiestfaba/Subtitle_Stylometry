Uh, no.

00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,710

- I got you good.
- Jesus Christ.

14
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,322
That was such a good one.

15
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,698
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,076
- Ow.
- My God.

17
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,952
- Give me a minute.
- How was your flight?

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,705
It was fine. Come here.
How was yours?

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,290
- It was good.
- Good to see you.

20
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,583
It was good.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,293
- Let's get your bag.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,961
Glad you made an effort.
What are you wearing?

23
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,380
I didn't know we were going
to a Bar Mitzvah.

24
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,423
It's a Bat Mitzvah.

25
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,219
Um, I'm actually, like...

26
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,555
I'm, like, a few hundred miles
away right now.

27
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,809
I jumped on a flight this morning
and I'm gonna be gone for the day.

28
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,479
But I'll be back tomorrow,
so don't worry about it.

29
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:44,688
God, dude.

30
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,942
28 shows in 30 days.
Have I missed one?

31
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,278
Have I missed one?

32
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,072
No, no. I'm not burned out.

33
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,616
I just have to... I just needed
to come home for a sec.

34
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,625
WOMAN:
So this is the high school, huh?

35
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,086
It looks like a mental ward.

36
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,505
Hey, do you really...
do you like this car?

37
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,799
Yeah, I like the car.
Why?

38
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,968
I don't know. It's just... that didn't
sound very convincing.

39
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,595
WOMAN: - No, baby, I like the...
- 'Cause I loved my other car.

40
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,984
- What are you looking for?
- Do you have any gum?

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,228
- Wait... wait a minute. I got...
- Oh.

42
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,017
- What do you... gum? It's right here.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,395
Oh, okay.

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,566
Thanks for coming with me.

45
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,067
Well, I'm excited
to meet everybody.

46
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,695
Finally get some dirt on you.

47
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,406
- You want some?
- No. I really don't want that.

48
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,825
- Have it. Have it.
- That's really gross.

49
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,160
(woman laughs)

50
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,662
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Boarding all rows for ﬂight...

51
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,873
Hey, where... where's Emily?

52
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,791
She had to work at the hospital
this weekend. She can't come.

53
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,711
What?
That frickin' sucks.

54
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,337
What, are you gonna cry about it?

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,839
I'm disappointed.

56
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm not disappointed.
It's the two of us. It's gonna be great.

57
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,010
- No, I know...
- It's like old times.

58
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,678
Just you and me, ese.

59
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,764
Okay, "pawl"

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,310
Okay, "Cholo." What, are you cultivating
a new reunion personality?

61
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,270
People say "ese."
People say ese all the time.

62
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,980
Okay.
Yes, Jason.

63
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,649
Listen, man.
I gotta... I gotta go.

64
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,276
- Oh, we just passed it...
(tires screech)

65
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,819
Aw...!

66
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,783
(Doorbell rings)

67
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,038
- Oh! Oh, my God.
(groaning)

68
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,709
- What's up, man?
(laughs)

69
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,294
Damn, you got fat, sucker.

70
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,046
I got fat? What, did you eat
one of your kids?

71
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,964
- I'm sexy. Hi, honey.
- What... hi.

72
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,341
- How you doing?
- Good to see you again.

73
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,426
- Welcome home. Come in.
- Sure.

74
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,595
MAN: You guys.

75
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,430
(woman laughs)

76
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,432
Hey, look who's here.

77
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,642
- Hi!
WOMAN: - Hi!

78
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,227
JAKE:
Samantha.

79
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,895
JESS:
It's so good to see you again.

80
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,314
- Oh, so good to see...
(crying)

81
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,316
That is a cute sweater vest.

82
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,817
- They're in matching sweaters.
JAKE: - Just like his daddy.

83
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,528
- They're in matching sweaters.
- What up, Sammy?

84
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,697
I'm so happy to see you.

85
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,324
Too bad you didn't come
with a shotgun.

86
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,243
- I'm so happy you guys are here.
- I'd blow my brains out.

87
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,495
Come on. All right, all right.
Enough about the kid.

88
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,748
- Come check this out.
SAMANTHA: - Go say hi...

89
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,125
Hi, darling.
SAMANTHA: - Lilly, say hi to Aunt Jess.

90
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,293
Yeah, that's the other one.

91
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,461
It's cool.
You don't have to...

92
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,629
- Lilly, baby.
- It's all right.

93
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,756
She don't care, you don't care.
She's not gonna remember.

94
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,258
(Crying continues)
- Okay.

95
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,426
Okay, okay. Shh.

96
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,220
There he is.

97
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,596
- Is that you, buddy?
- Jake? Oh.

98
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,556
- Man, how are you? Good?
- Long time no see.

99
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,016
- Hi, I'm Jess.
- Scott.

100
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,643
Scott?
Nice to meet you.

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,812
- Suki.
- Suki, nice to meet you. Oh...

102
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,231
- you're the one that lives in Japan.
- Yes.

103
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,691
No.
Not from me, man.

104
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,151
I see you every day.
I got you on Google Alert.

105
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,695
- Oh, yeah?
- Is that weird?

106
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,571
- That's totally weird, dude.
- Is it weird?

107
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,207
Naw, it's not weird.
My mom's got me on Google Alert.

108
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,450
Oh, my God. We've been trying
to get out there for so long.

109
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,286
It just... I don't know,
hasn't happened.

110
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,787
Aw, don't worry about it.
You got time.

111
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,122
- You got time. I'm not going anywhere.
- Is it amazing?

112
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,166
JAKE: Don't worry about it.
I don't come back, either,

113
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,752
and I live in driving distance.

114
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,546
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

115
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,339
JAKE: Wait a minute.
Is that who I think it is out there?

116
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,759
Oh, my God.
Look who it is.

117
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,845
MARTY: - Aw, Jacob.
- What is going on?

118
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,388
- Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.
JAKE: - You're in trouble right here.

119
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,224
Dude, things must be going great, man.
You look fantastic.

120
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,395
Um, can I say I can't complain
without sounding like I'm bragging?

121
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,650
(laughs)
- 'Cause I can't complain.

122
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,273
AJ: How long did it take
you guys to drive in?

123
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,650
Oh, about an hour, hour and a half.
There was a little bit of traffic.

124
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,277
MARTY: Hour and a half.
That's not nearly enough.

125
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,737
You gotta get away
from here, Jake.

126
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,780
You gotta run away
and not look back.

127
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,907
You're better than that
is what I'm trying to say.

128
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,868
Cully, really?
What is in here?

129
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,537
- Nut up, bro.
- This is straight vodka.

130
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,414
No, there's a little bit
of soda in it.

131
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,374
You're gonna have so much fun
at Grandma and Grandpa's.

132
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,584
Yes, you are.

133
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,544
Mommy's gonna have
a night without you.

134
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,089
She loves you, but she needs to be
with some adults, doesn't she?

135
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,342
Hey, hey, guys.
We got an idea.

136
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,344
Is there any way we can sneak
some of this booze in?

137
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,846
Isn't there...
there's an open bar, right?

138
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,806
I know that.
It's the principle of the thing.

139
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,600
Yeah, we did it in high school
for like, every event.

140
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,560
Why would we not do it now?
'Cause we're too "mature"?

141
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,228
- We're adults?
- Exactly.

142
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,855
Hey, do you have any flasks?

143
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,899
'Cause I feel like we're each
gonna need one.

144
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,194
I can't find anything with a lid.
How you doing?

145
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,363
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry, you guys.

146
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,491
I got two kids and a wife who
doesn't let me drink in public any more.

147
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,034
- Shocking.
- I made an exception for tonight,

148
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,744
which I'm beginning to think
was a mistake.

149
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,705
I found this, but I need something small
enough to fit down my pants comfortably.

150
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,290
SAMANTHA: Are you touching yourself
in front of my children?

151
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,958
MARTY:
I'm not doing it sexually.

152
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,877
What's your kid got over there?

153
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,592
- Could we get a ride?
- It's good.

154
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,594
My mom dropped us off.

155
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,763
Wow, so ninth grade of you.

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,224
I actually haven't driven a car
since I moved to Tokyo.

157
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,475
Yeah, I don't own a car.

158
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,185
That's what happens
when you live in an actual city.

159
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,562
I live in New York City, Snooki.

160
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,065
- Great. Then you can drive.
- How does that make sense?

161
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,275
Hey, no, no, no, no.
Don't leave.

162
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,736
(Car starts)
- God damn it.

163
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,196
I thought we were
gonna go together.

164
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,907
Sam and I just gotta drop
the kids off with her mom.

165
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,992
It's only gonna be a minute.
They live like, two miles away.

166
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,911
Mom.

167
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,747
She's coming. Mommy's coming.
You're a big boy.

168
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,707
Hey, listen. You don't
have to pretend to like my kids.

169
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,835
So cute. No, man.
It's completely genuine.

170
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,754
- Come on, Bubba. I know.
- He's awesome.

171
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,215
I'm not saying I don't think
they're cool. They're super cool.

172
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,510
I love the shit out of 'em.
But it doesn't mean you have to.

173
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,847
You know what I mean?
So, where'd you park?

174
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,932
Uh, I took a cab.

175
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,520
CD PLAYING: ♪ Oh, you can't say
"pfft" on the radio ♪

176
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,063
♪ You can't say "pfft"
on the radio... ♪

177
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,107
Can we turn this off,
please, honey?

178
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,525
Did you not
put the night light in here?

179
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,152
Pfft, Pfft. pfft.

180
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,679
CULLY: - Please turn this off.
SAMANTHA: - Shoot.

181
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,031
My mother still doesn't have one.
Reeves, I think we have your CD in here.

182
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,535
- I know he listens to it all the time.
REEVES: - God, no. Please, no.

183
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,579
Bro, we're listening to your CD.

184
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,581
Pfft, oh!

185
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,040
(Cully laughs)
I'm playing it right now.

186
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,750
- No, please don't.
- Come on, man.

187
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,170
- Don't. No, no, no, no, no.
- I wanna listen to it with you.

188
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,088
I don't wanna hear that shit.
Come on.

189
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,507
You're gonna cause a commotion
at this thing tonight.

190
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,509
- You know that?
- Yeah.

191
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,804
Uh, I wasn't gonna come, man.
I had no intention of coming.

192
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,806
(Lilly babbling)
- I just...

193
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,349
you know, I got the itch.

194
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,477
Yeah, dude.
I know exactly what you mean.

195
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,271
I actually got a lot of work
to do tonight.

196
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,898
Work to do?

197
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,649
Yeah, I don't know how well
you remember this,

198
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,111
but apparently I guess I was kind of
an asshole in high school.

199
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,905
"Kind of an asshole," honey?

200
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,742
I loved you guys,
but kinda hated you, didn't I?

201
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,243
- Got the night light?
- Yes.

202
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,163
- Awesome.
- I... aw, I forgot his poo-poo.

203
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,499
God damn it.
Honey, we gotta go.

204
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,750
His "poo-poo"?

205
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,086
Oh, it's his blankie.
Yeah.

206
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,379
You gonna get
your poo-poo, buddy?

207
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,590
- Oh.
(laughs)

208
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,259
REEVES: - That's hilarious.
- Yeah.

209
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,787
CULLY: This is gonna be good.
It's gonna be good.

210
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,848
I'm gonna apologize to some people
tonight and I'm gonna mean it.

211
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,767
So who you going for tonight?

212
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,018
What do you mean?

213
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,520
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

214
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,940
You're like, a single, handsome,
interesting, funny guy.

215
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,194
You'd be the belle
of the ball tonight.

216
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,798
You can choose anybody you want.
Who you gonna go for?

217
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,111
You sound a little jealous
up there, brother.

218
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,029
- Yeah, right?
- I am jealous.

219
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,198
I am... for once, I'm actually jealous
of this asshole.

220
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,784
Oh, yeah. It must be such a burden
having to go home

221
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,203
to your awesome doctor wife
every night. I'm so sorry, AJ.

222
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,205
- Marty...
- Well-paying job,

223
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,581
- your four-bedroom house.
- Marty...

224
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,375
- What a nightmare.
- Answer the question.

225
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,377
- Answer the question.
- I don't know.

226
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,170
- Oh, come on.
- I haven't given it much thought.

227
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,256
- Come on... I'm a married man.
- Exactly.

228
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,674
I've been having sex with my eyes closed
for the last three years.

229
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,760
I gotta live vicariously through you.
It's a hypothetical question.

230
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,696
If you could hook up with any girl
you went to high school with,

231
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,515
- who would you choose?
- I don't know. Anna, probably.

232
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,183
- Anna? Anna?
- Maybe, I don't know if she's single.

233
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,269
- She's probably not single.
- That's a great choice.

234
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,563
That is a great choice.
That is a very good choice.

235
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,897
(Speaking Japanese)

236
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,357
No, no, no.
It's a good choice.

237
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,068
(Scott speaking Japanese)

238
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,296
MARTY: What are you saying
back there?

239
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,075
MARTY: I just prefer Ralph Macchio.
I don't know why that's a bad thing.

240
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,203
JAKE: $20 says he says something
about beating me.

241
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,455
(German accent)
Well, your little Volvo

242
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,708
did not pass the American test.

243
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,002
Rental car, too.
Didn't even try.

244
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,088
- I'm not even-I'm not doing it.
MARTY: - All right, Mario Andretti.

245
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,466
- I'm not doing it.
- He'll never stop giving you shit, man.

246
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,427
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too, man.

247
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,178
It's good to see everybody, man.

248
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,598
God, everyone came back.
Is Mary coming?

249
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,558
Uh, no, I don't think so.

250
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,477
I think Sam said she got an e-mail from
her saying she wasn't gonna make it.

251
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,230
(Scoffs) Oh, well.

252
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,233
What if she did make it?
Would you still have brought Jess?

253
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,736
- Yeah. Why...
- You sure?

254
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,903
Why wouldn't I?

255
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,781
- Don't... don't give me that.
SCOTT: - It's a fair question, bro.

256
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,783
One, two, three.

257
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,328
(Camera shutter clicks)

258
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,251
JESS: - Look at this place.
PHOTOGRAPHER: - Complimentary photo?

259
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,544
MARTY: - Yes.
JAKE: - Uh...

260
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,921
PHOTOGRAPHER: - Right over here, guys.
JESS: - Yeah, you boys go ahead.

261
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
No, no, no.
It's your school. Go ahead.

262
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,718
SCOTT: All right, let's do it.
Just the guys.

263
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,345
Why are you so excited
for this photograph?

264
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,763
Right here, guys.

265
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,307
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Three, two, one.

266
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,267
(Camera shutter clicks)

267
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,477
JESS: - Hi.
JULIE: - Hi. Welcome. Good to see you.

268
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,729
Come over here.
The name tags are right over here.

269
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,856
So glad you guys made it.

270
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,400
Everybody's upstairs for a drink, so
after you get a name tag, go up there...

271
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,986
- Dude.
- Yeah, hi! Nice to see you.

272
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,822
- Grab a drink upstairs, okay?
- Oh, you mean... what do you want?

273
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,699
Okay.
She's busy.

274
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,077
I get the night off of name duty.

275
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,244
What's... what is that?

276
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,330
JAKE: I panic every time I go
to introduce her to somebody.

277
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,624
- I forget their name.
- So I introduce myself.

278
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,334
I'm like,
"Hi, I'm Jess. You are?"

279
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,544
Yeah, so the two of you guys
have it all figured out. I love that.

280
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,713
She's got it all figured out.
She just takes care of me.

281
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,881
We're gonna get drinks.
We'll see you in there.

282
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,049
- Okay.
- I'm so going.

283
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,467
I can't stop looking
at her boobs.

284
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,386
(laughs)

285
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,847
Okay, so whatever you need tonight,
I am your wingman.

286
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,516
- Oh, you're gonna be my wingman?
- Yeah.

287
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,017
Please don't do that.
You're the worst...

288
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,327
I love you, but you're
the worst wingman.

289
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,838
What are you talking about?
I'm the best wingman.

290
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,146
Yeah, you really hooked it up
with Julie.

291
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,354
- I'm the best wingman in the world.
- See, the worst wingman in the world

292
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,483
always says they're the best
wingman in the world.

293
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,193
- But I'm the best, though.
- Yeah, that's my point.

294
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,321
- So you ready for this?
- We'll see.

295
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,198
How about some shots?

296
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,491
I love you.

297
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,370
MARTY: Dude, that wasn't on purpose.
That wasn't part of the game.

298
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,705
Okay, how was I supposed
to know she was pregnant?

299
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,872
How were you supposed to know
she was pregnant?

300
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,166
Second of all, I'm the one
who came off badly

301
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,238
- and you came off really well.
- Yeah, but you just came off, like...

302
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,378
AJ: That was
good wingmanship.

303
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,005
No, I came off like I have racist,
weird friends who say things like,

304
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,507
"Of course you're pregnant.
You're a Latina."

305
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,758
You're not your friends, though.
You're not your friends.

306
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,135
Wait, wait.
Stay in the shadows.

307
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,470
I'm so glad you're here.

308
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,055
- Yo, what's up?
- Oh.

309
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,015
Went ahead and made
your name tag for you.

310
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,892
- Ooh, okay.
- Let's stick it.

311
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,061
Maybe.
Okay, yeah.

312
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,730
- Be...
(camera shutter clicks)

313
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,898
...serious. That was-
sorry, that one wasn't good.

314
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,401
- Can we do it again, please?
JULIE: - Welcome, welcome. Come in.

315
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,611
Look at Reeves.
It's happening already.

316
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,073
- Could I get some singles, please?
JULIE: - Everybody grab a name tag.

317
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,242
Hey, Reeves, man.
I gotta borrow you for just one second.

318
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,578
- Okay? He'll be right back.
- Oh.

319
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,580
No, he won't.
Don't follow him.

00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,914

Jake?

326
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,094
- Hey, man.
- Oh, my God.

327
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,054
- How you doing?
- Good. What's going on, man?

328
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,724
- This is Jess.
- Hi, this is my wife Olivia.

329
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,350
- Hi.
- Hi, How are you doing?

330
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,769
- Jake, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

331
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,896
Can you believe this?

332
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,064
(laughing)

333
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,943
What are you doing?

334
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,612
- Garrity?
- Cully.

335
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,616
Dude. Oh, my God, look at you.
You look all normal and shit.

336
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,285
You look like a frickin'
J.Crew ad over here.

337
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,620
Look at this guy.

338
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,371
JAKE: You got, like,
a Jude Law thing happening.

339
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,166
You do.
You look just like Jude Law.

340
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,335
OLIVIA: - As opposed to what?
- Yeah.

341
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,878
OLIVIA:
Who did you used to look like?

342
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,675
What's your name again?

343
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,012
- Uh, Peter.
- Peter.

344
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,806
I was a dick to you
back in high school, wasn't I?

345
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,308
PETER: - What are you...
CULLY: - Let me buy his drink.

346
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,853
- No, it's... it's an open bar.
- Is it? Double vodka, no mixers.

347
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,188
Here, take your tip back.

348
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,606
- I'll leave a tip for you.
- I-i-it's fine.

349
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,615
Uh, complimentary photo?

350
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,243
Oh, sure.

351
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,998
You want anybody in it with you?

352
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, no. It's okay.

353
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,837
I can't believe they chose this hotel.
It's perfect.

354
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,216
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

355
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,969
(Yelling)
- Oh. my God!

356
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,556
- You look amazing!
- Look how skinny you are!

357
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,478
Hi, can I get my picture taken
with you too?

358
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,522
- Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

359
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,650
Ahem.

360
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,278
- Gorgeous. Let's take a photo.
- Come here. Come on.

361
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,197
Do you mind if we do it again?
I think I blinked.

362
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,826
Yeah, I think I did, too.

363
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,911
Let's get this jag poppin'.

364
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,289
Oh, G-Money.

365
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,750
Get low, baby.
Come on, get in here.

366
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,753
Wha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, oh!

367
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,339
- What's up, man?
- This is Andre.

368
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,948
- This is one of my oldest friends.
- How you doing?

369
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,719
- Hi.
- This is my wife Olivia.

370
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,722
- Hi.
- This is your wife?

371
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,515
Yeah, we're... we're married.

372
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,225
You married
a white girl, for real?

373
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,852
You...

374
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,104
Wow.
That's crazy.

375
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,064
- He's, uh...
- Yeah.

376
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,572
This is so amazing.

377
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,575
Well, it should be. I've been looking
forward to this for a very long time.

378
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,870
- So have I.
- Oh.

379
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,539
- Mortgage broker, huh?
- Mortgage-yes.

380
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,334
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sure you're awesome at it.

381
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,543
- I just...
- Really?

382
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,795
I didn't see it coming.
I'm not gonna lie. I...

383
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,714
- I feel good about that now.
- Watch it, man.

384
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,174
What is this?
What's that?

385
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,343
Oh, this is, uh-this is Julie's.

386
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,261
Yeah.
You stole it from her?

387
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,679
NICK:
I just thought it'd be more fun

388
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,140
if I just filmed all of us
getting wasted tonight.

389
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,601
- Done. More shots?
- That'd be really funny.

390
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,769
- Yes.
- Done.

391
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,521
They're not all for me.
They're for everybody.

392
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,106
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

393
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,610
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. How are you?

394
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,321
- So good.
- Now the party can start.

395
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,198
You heard it, everybody.

396
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,116
Now the party can start.

397
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,956
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

398
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,836
AJ:
I miss you so much, Cully.

399
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,965
I can't do this.

400
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,510
I just thought you were
really into rap music.

401
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,804
Yeah, well, I was.
I still am.

402
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,306
No, I know.
But I thought that meant

403
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,600
you liked Coolio and stuff.

404
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,519
I didn't know that meant
you thought you were black.

405
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,105
So, you guys
come with boyfriends

406
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,524
or you married or...

407
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,150
I'm married.

408
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,860
Who... who'd you marry?

409
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,238
Oh, you've seen the commercials?

410
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,532
♪ Calling Ford, calling Ford... ♪

411
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,617
You married Cully?

412
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,828
AJ: Dude, dude, look.
There she is.

413
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,037
There's Anna.

414
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,706
God, she looks good,
doesn't she?

415
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,165
Yeah, she looks really glamorous.

416
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,334
ANNA:
Let me help you with that.

417
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,128
MARTY:
Is she gonna...

418
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,506
- We'll... we'll work up to it.
- Yeah, okay.

419
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,676
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

420
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,844
- Okay.
MAN: - Where's she going?

421
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,137
I'll be right back.

422
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,388
She probably won't come back.
I think you scared her off.

423
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,849
Good job.
You scared her off.

424
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,142
She might not come back.

425
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,768
MAN: So, is this
getting serious or what?

426
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,353
Yeah, of course it's getting serious.
We've been together for, like,

427
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,896
three and a half years.

428
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,189
NICK:
So, it's serious?

429
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,983
I would say it's serious, yes.

430
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,069
How black, uh...
did you act?

431
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,031
Did I act? Like on a scale
from one to 10?

432
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,408
Like on a scale
from white to black?

433
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,869
I'd say, like, a...

434
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,829
a dark gray.

435
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,165
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing with my camera?

436
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,543
Okay, hi, yeah. No, we need
to put the camera back right now.

437
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,628
- Vanillo, I'm serious. Just...
- But I'm gonna get everybody.

438
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,547
Yeah, right,
you will get everybody.

439
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,923
- Just put it back. It's just perfect.
- I'm gonna put it back.

440
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,383
- I set up perfectly.
- I'll put it back.

441
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,760
- Okay, thank you.
- After I do this.

442
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,927
No, Vanillo!

443
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,721
I got a baby girl.
You wanna see a picture?

444
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,890
Yeah, I do.

445
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,892
She's a beauty.

446
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,226
- She is beautiful.
- There she is.

447
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,520
Wait a minute.
You don't have any babies.

448
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,065
- A boat? You have a boat?
- Yeah, I told you about the boat.

449
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,232
- Do you have any...
- You didn't tell me...

450
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,234
- I don't have any boats, no.
- Kids.

451
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,489
Does he have any kids?
Look at the guy.

452
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,737
He's like the king
of New York City.

453
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,948
He's out dining on Wall Street,
sleeping with models and stuff.

454
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,159
- Tell her. Tell her about the models.
- Uh...

455
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,661
Being genuine is not something

456
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,540
that comes easily for me
as far as an emotion.

457
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,919
I want to make sure
that my "genuinity"

458
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,546
is expressing itself
clearly to you.

459
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,632
Sure.
And it's so good to see you.

460
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,883
SAM:
So good to see you.

461
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,011
It's been... I'm gonna come
by the dealership.

462
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,013
- Good to see you, Peter.
- I just-my friends are...

463
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,348
Oh, jackpot.
Look at that table.

464
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:22,227
No, no, no, no, no.
Come back. Come back.

465
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,854
Let them do their thing.
Let them talk.

466
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,023
Look at them.

467
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,944
Oh, I have so much work to do
to that table.

468
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,613
I know. I know you do.
Just don't be too aggressive, you know?

469
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,949
'Cause then it gets
a little assholey.

470
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,243
Well, nice catching up
with you, Elise.

471
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,287
Oh, my God.
This is what I mean.

472
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,956
This is why you're
the worst wingman in the world.

473
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,291
Oh, come on, man.
I was trying to create demand.

474
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,043
- What?
- It's called salesmanship.

475
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,878
- What?
- If she knows that you've been

476
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,630
with other high-quality women,
she's gonna be like,

477
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,258
"Oh, maybe I can be
one of those high-quality women."

478
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,634
Do you really believe
what you're saying?

479
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,136
- Makes a lot of sense.
- That makes sense, not what you did.

480
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,721
You showed her photos of your
goddamn boat. Who does that?

481
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,473
She was asking
to see baby pictures. I was...

482
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,725
Yeah, which is when
normal people say, "Oh, I'm so sorry.

483
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,978
I don't have any babies
with my wife yet to take pictures of."

484
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,479
It's a conversation killer.
It's a conversation killer.

485
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,106
No, no, no.
You wearing a captain's hat

486
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,649
standing next
to a little grounded boat...

487
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,526
that's a real conversation killer.

488
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,952
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

489
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,787
- What are you doing?
- You left me out there for, like,

490
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,873
I don't even know how long,
all by myself.

491
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,124
I've been in here two minutes.

492
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,626
- Yeah, two minutes is too long.
- Stop.

493
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,045
All your friends are out there.

494
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,840
I don't care about them.
I <i>care</i> about being with you.

495
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,508
Aw.

496
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,553
But Cully did ask

497
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,640
if I could go out to the car
with him and Dre.

498
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,517
That's what this is about.

499
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,561
Go ahead.

500
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,479
- I can go?
- Yeah.

501
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,023
- You wanna come?
- No.

502
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,524
I'm gonna hang out with Sam.

503
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,610
- No, just come on...
- But you can't have more than two puffs

504
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,528
because you're
a lightweight, remember?

505
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,071
- Oh, is that what I am?
- Don't.

506
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,324
- Really?
- Yes, don't you remember?

507
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,874
Why are you looking at me?

508
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,420
I love looking at you.

509
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,675
Could look at you forever.

510
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,969
That's sweet.

511
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,266
You need to go.
I love you.

512
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,268
- Nobody in here.
- No, baby.

513
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,146
Someone's gonna come in here.
Someone's gonna come in.

514
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,481
I love you, leave.

515
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,441
I gotta do my makeup.

516
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,444
One puff, lightweight.
Don't forget.

517
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,324
(Jake coughing)

518
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,159
JAKE: Dre, you're a lifesaver
with this stuff.

519
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,578
DRE: No, I got glaucoma, dude.
So I got a cause.

520
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,913
(all laughing)

521
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,748
I can't handle any more
two-minute conversations, man.

522
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,959
At least you only got a two-minute
conversation from Todd.

523
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,420
I got a 20-minute conversation
from his wife, Lauren.

524
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,172
JAKE: Well, at least you're talking
about something interesting.

525
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,258
I gotta talk about mortgages

526
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,010
and default loans
and all this bullshit.

527
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,554
I still can't believe
that he's a mortgage broker.

528
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,604
You'd have had
a job like this, too,

529
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,225
if you weren't so damn
good at something.

530
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,769
You know what I'm good at?
Two-minute conversations.

531
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,938
- I'm the king of them.
- Then tell me how to get out of them.

532
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,565
You just got to tell them
you gotta go to the bathroom, dude.

533
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,110
I've gone to the bathroom
like, 12 times today.

534
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,279
I'm sure Sam
really appreciates that.

535
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,780
She's a big girl.

536
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,116
- Kinda.
JAKE: - Are you saying she's a big girl?

537
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,451
CULLY: - She was in high school.
(laughing)

538
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,788
Oh, Sam. I don't know how
she deals with you sometimes, man.

539
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,623
- I love you, though.
- You know what, dude?

540
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,751
You just... none of you guys
know shit.

541
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,003
You're not married.

542
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,463
CULLY: You know what?
Marry Jess. Then we'll talk.

543
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,133
Are you... you want me to marry Jess?
Is that what you're saying?

544
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,218
CULLY: Yeah, marry Jess, dude.
You'll know my pain then.

545
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,469
DRE: Don't do it.
Don't do this.

546
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,514
It's okay. All right.
Open the glove box.

547
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,351
Grab that envelope right there.

548
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,188
Hey, Cully.
Look at this.

549
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,565
What is it?

550
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,278
DRE:
Oh, shit.

551
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,863
- What?
JAKE: - Yep.

552
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,031
REEVES: - Wow.
- Whoa.

553
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,283
CULLY: - When'd you get that?
- Bought it like, eight months ago.

554
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,036
You bought it eight months ago
and you never told me about it?

555
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,539
No, well, I'm gonna tell you.
I gotta tell her first.

556
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,790
But, yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

557
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,626
It just hasn't quite been...
just hasn't been quite right.

558
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,420
You'd leave it in an envelope?

559
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,631
Yeah, it's better than a ring box.

560
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,427
And, like, so she can find it and say,
"I wonder what's in the ring box."

561
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,471
- Well, why haven't you given it to her?
- Boom.

562
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,805
(Coughs)

563
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,016
I tri... I mean, I've planned
a few things

564
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,601
and they just weren't exactly right.

565
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,020
Women don't care
how you ask them.

566
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,065
All they care is that you're stupid
enough to ask them.

567
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,941
All they want is the ring.

568
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,361
I know people, man.
That's what I do.

569
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,738
I don't sing,
I don't sell cars,

570
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,366
I don't do what you do.

571
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,452
That's how I eat.

572
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,287
- It's why you eat?
- That's how I eat.

573
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,747
What does that mean?

574
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,875
I don't think you know people
as good as you think you know people.

575
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,168
It's what I do, all right?

576
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,879
Just... it sounds like you put a lot of
pressure on yourself, too,

577
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,091
to make it super perfect. I mean, you
gotta be open to spontaneity, too, man.

578
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,301
I mean, if you're ready to do it,
just pull the trigger, you know?

579
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,388
I mean, you've built
a real solid foundation.

580
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,723
You've got the job,
you got the nice car...

581
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,600
- I don't know about the car.
- Yeah, dude.

582
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,477
I think it's a very adult car.

583
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,521
DRE: - I think it's very nice.
REEVES: - I do, too.

584
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,731
I think it sucks, dude.

585
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,531
JAKE: - That's good.
DRE: - Trick Daddy had a Volvo, man.

586
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,402
- These are nice cars.
CULLY: - I put him in this Volvo.

587
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,173
REEVES: - They're very safe.
CULLY: - They're very safe.

588
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,989
That's a good point.
That is a good point, Reeves.

589
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,408
DRE:
The back seat is nice.

590
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,118
CULLY: - You don't drive a Volvo.
DRE: - This is nice. My grandmother

591
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,787
- would be proud of it.
- If Ford owns Volvo, it's a good car.

592
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,081
"Consumer Reports" number one
every single year.

593
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,416
I'm fried, dude.

594
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,043
- Look who it is.
CULLY: - Oh, holy shit.

595
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,254
- I thought she wasn't coming.
DRE: - Oh, shit.

596
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,298
DRE:
Yo, who is that she's with?

597
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,384
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

598
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,220
Like eight years ago.

599
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,972
Did you tell Jess about her?

600
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,724
Yeah, of course
I told Jess about her.

601
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,476
Oh, this is gonna get weird.

602
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,311
Yep.

603
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,367
How we doing here?
Did you get enough to eat?

604
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,619
If I wanted to be in a boy band,
I woulda been in a boy band.

605
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,121
I woulda started my own.

606
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,873
We would've been
bigger than NSync.

607
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,376
It looked like she waved at you.
Was she like, one of your... shorties?

608
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,004
You're in real estate,
I'm in real estate.

609
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,172
- What?
- What?

610
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,966
(whispering)

611
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,676
Fingerlings.

612
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,761
Fingerlingin' good.

613
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,307
Finger lickin' good.
Joke.

614
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,018
Do you mind if I sit here?

615
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,937
Oh, hey.
Hey.

616
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,606
- Hey.
- How's it going?

617
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,232
- Good.
- Did you see Marty yet?

618
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,525
- He's...
- I haven't. Is he here?

619
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,753
He's somewhere.
He's around somewhere.

620
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,487
- He was looking for you.
- Oh, wow.

633
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,559
He had to go
to the bathroom really bad.

634
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,853
Baby, it's fine.
I've just been over there

635
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,689
talking to Sam, who is really,
really, really cool.

636
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,441
- Like, I love her.
- I know. Tim's...

637
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,693
Love her. And then this
really weird guy came up

638
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,029
who was like, tall, he's skinny,
he's really annoying,

639
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,823
with like, crazy weird hair.

640
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,159
- Was he touching you at all?
- No.

641
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,536
- You sure?
- No, he wasn't.

642
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,412
But he was driving me crazy.

643
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,749
Oh, shit. Uh...

644
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,042
- Hi.
- How are you?

645
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,211
- Hi... I'm sorry, that was...
MARY: - Sorry. Yeah, no. Of course.

646
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,712
I apologize. I went right in.

647
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,548

Nice to meet you, too.
Mary, sorry.

00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,931
- Oh, okay. Of course.
- Paul.

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,228
- Uh, this is Jess.
- I'm Jess.

655
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,729
Are you a classmate as well?

656
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,023
No, no. I'm his girlfriend.

657
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,693
I'm just here, supporting,
having fun.

658
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,612
Jake, that's
a pretty cool name.

659
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,114
MARY: - Yeah.
- Thank you.

660
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,407
PAUL: - I like that name.
- All right.

661
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,658
MARY:
Ah, four-letter word.

662
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,285
- Aren't you glad we came?
- I am glad.

663
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,705
I mean, I was really worried that...
but you've seen so many people...

664
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,543
Hi, sorry.
Is this... is this seat taken?

665
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,129
- No.
- No? Okay.

666
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,298
I'm just gonna join you guys.

667
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,552
LAUREN: - Hi.
- Hi.

668
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,680
That's for you.

669
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,600
What's this for?

670
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,727
I owe you three bucks.

671
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,688
- You do?
- Yeah.

672
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,149
Mr. Ferguson's physics class.

673
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,651
Junior year we went to the planetarium,
you remember?

674
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,279
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

675
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,906
I don't remember anything, really,

676
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,658
about junior year, though, so...

677
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,661
Oh, well, you let me borrow some money,
so I thought I'd pay you back.

678
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

679
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,666
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

680
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,501
(Softly) It's nice to see you.

681
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,919
Thanks.

682
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,631
You're actually the reason
that I switched to the tuba.

683
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,549
Really?

684
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,636
Um... I'm honored?

685
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,429
You shouldn't be.

686
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,766
I switched to the tuba because
it was too big to take home from school

687
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,310
so I didn't have to carry it
on the bus to and from school,

688
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,520
which meant that I didn't have
an instrument at the bus stop,

689
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,147
which meant that
you forgot that I was in band,

690
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,399
which meant that
you finally left me alone.

691
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,153
I owe you...

692
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,532
and you, and you, and you,

693
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,284
and you...

694
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:44,038
and you an apology.
Each and every single one of you...

695
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,831
- Okay, okay.
- From the bottom of my heart.

696
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:50,127
Yeah, okay, okay.
You've apologized enough

697
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,505
for everybody, to everybody.

698
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,840
Does everybody
accept my apology, though?

699
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,468
'Cause that's the thing
that is so important to me.

700
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,762
Yes.

701
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,391
They're all accepting it, babe.
You did good.

702
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,687
Really?

703
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,563
- We were known as the Smash Crew.
OLIVIA: - Mm-hmm.

704
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,691
When we weren't smashin',
we were sleeping.

705
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,984
And we always went to sleep
after we smashed.

706
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,820
No cuddling.
Tell her about it, baby.

707
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,781
GARRITY: - Smashing was dancing.
- Boom, yeah. That's what they call it.

708
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,700
- Look, I... cheers.
- Andre's kidding. It's like dancing.

709
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,660
No, it's funny.
I think it's funny.

710
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,870
I married a former wigger
and I had no idea.

711
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,706
It's hilarious.

712
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,333
Yeah, you might wanna "achay"
on the "worday," you know?

713
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,211
"The worday"?
What word?

714
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,422
Wigger?

715
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,757
- Yep, that one.
(Dre laughs)

716
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,218
I think, uh,
it's kind of offensive.

717
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,303
- Is it?
DRE: - Who's offended? We ain't.

718
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,471
MAN: - Not at all.
- They're not offended.

719
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,223
DRE: - Boom.
- I know, but it's two words

720
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,726
squished into one word,
and the one word would be offensive.

721
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,644
DRE: Ooh-whee, time-out.
Twenty seconds.

722
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,981
Excuse me, ladies.
Where are you guys sitting?

723
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,400
I don't know.
You got a spot for us?

724
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,361
I have a gentleman here who's willing
to open up two seats for you.

725
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,071
- Yay.
- Oh, ladies. Please sit down.

726
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,116
- Would you like to be our guest?
- Have a seat. Have a seat.

727
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,868
All right.

728
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,619
Wait. Wait. Time-out.

729
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,246
Switch.

730
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,956
WOMAN: - Are you kidding me?
- What?

731
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,166
- Ouch.
- What?

732
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,834
You coulda just said
you wanted to see...

733
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,794
DRE: I just wanted to see you
across the table.

734
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,756
- Uh-huh.
- Sit down, girl.

735
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,923
- Well, hello.
- How you doin?

736
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,216
- Good, how are you?
- Mm.

737
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,760
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I call you Snuggie?

738
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,386
Sure.

739
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,346
- Uh, you want a beer?
- I'll get it.

740
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,931
- You sure?
- You okay?

741
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,100
- I'm good, thank you.
PAUL: - Honey?

742
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,935
- I'll just do water now.
- Water.

743
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,562
Yeah.

744
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,565
- I'm sorry. What?
- Yes, I'm drinking water.

745
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:38,110
Yes, sorry. I lost the coin toss.
Designated driver.

746
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,530
SAM: Jess, you have to come look
at this baby's face.

747
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,824
- You're gonna die.
- I'm gonna go over there.

748
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,493
- I'll be back.
- All right.

749
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,287
Honey, look at this baby.
Look at that face.

750
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,122
WOMAN:
She is too much.

751
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,373
Oh, my God.

752
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,792
Seriously, why don't
you just stay here?

753
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,127
No, we live... we're just 45 minutes
out of town.

754
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:59,465
It's not that bad. It's so nice to...
sleep in your own bed.

755
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,760
(laughs) It makes me happy.

756
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,929
I'm really kind of shocked.

757
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,722
I didn't think
you were gonna show.

758
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,809
- Sam said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't, actually.

759
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,228
These things can kinda...

760
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,313
he convinced me last minute
to come by.

761
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,148
I think he's right.
I would've regretted it more...

762
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:20,152
- Ah. Convinced you.
- ...had I not come.

763
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,905
It's really good to see you.

764
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:28,494
- You, too.
- Yeah, I tried to find you online.

765
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,330
- Come on.
- There's a lot of Jake Staff ords.

766
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,749
I'm just saying.
Shocking.

767
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,543
You know I can't do any of that at all.

768
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,838
- I'm technologically ignorant.
- Yeah.

769
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,841
I don't have any of those things,
either, but I really...

770
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,509
No, I know. I know.

771
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,012
I looked.
You're not there, either.

772
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,268
You're married, man.

773
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,270
- That's a...
- Yeah.

774
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,064
Well...

775
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,899
- Thank you.
- Sure.

776
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,527
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
- Cheers.

777
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,028
Look who finally
decided to show up.

778
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,572
- I know.
- Looks so awkward.

779
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,198
It really is.

780
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,702
I'm so glad I never dated anyone
who went to our high school.

781
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,996
I could never handle that.

782
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,581
- No?
- Mmm.

783
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:17,293
Weren't you seeing someone
that whole year we had physics together?

784
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,295
Mmmmm.
Randie Rustenberg.

785
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,298
- Where is she?
- She's in Bolivia.

786
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,507
- She...
- Wow.

787
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,511
Yeah, she's a Jew for Jesus now.
She's down there doing missionary work.

788
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,765
- She seemed so punk rock.
- Yeah, she was.

789
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,977
I think that...

790
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,586
you date who you're supposed
to like in high school.

791
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,522
Not who you actually like.

792
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,402
- Did you like your boyfriend?
- I loved my boyfriend.

793
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

794
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,405
Even after he moved to Austin?

795
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,408
WOMAN:
Ahem...

796
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,911
- Oh, hello.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

797
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,495
- How you doing?
- Good.

798
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,414
I just had to come
and tell you that "Never Had"

799
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,916
is one of my top ten
favorite songs.

800
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,251
Wow, thank you very much.
Thanks.

801
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,419
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

802
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,921
Most favorite song ever.

803
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,424
Ah, well. Let's not go crazy.
All right.

804
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,302
So how did you remember
that he had moved to Austin?

805
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,970
I don't know.
Do you have a cigarette?

806
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,555
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm not just saying that

807
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,683
- because we were classmates.
- Oh, no. Don't worry. I believe you.

808
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,936
Can we smoke that?
Yeah, okay.

809
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,145
- Bye.
- Nice to see you again.

810
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,064
- Yeah, bye.
- All right, bye.

811
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,815
- He wanted to date me and I...
NICK: - You were dating somebody

812
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,692
- you were cooking with.
- That's not the way it was.

813
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:24,860
- That's what you were doing.
- He wanted to date me

814
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,279
- and I was with somebody already.
- And what happened?

815
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,281
She left her purse over here.

816
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,824
She was here?

817
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,160
Yeah, well, you were sitting
at the buffet and...

818
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,663
What? Okay, did she say anything
about being single?

819
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,081
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?
- Well, she didn't have a ring

820
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,457
on her finger.

821
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:39,930
You looked at her finger?
You're a married man.

822
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,605
- You looked at her finger.
- I did a ring check, I mean...

823
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,337
Oh, a ring check.
Is that something guys do?

824
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,255
You check... you always
check the ring, right, Scotty?

825
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,342
Um, you know, I don't...
I don't really...

826
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,928
- I don't... yeah, I checked.
- What?

827
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,183
- Yeah, I checked.
- Is this a thing...

828
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,974
Well, it's Anna. I went pretty hard
after her in high school, so I just...

829
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,393
- I was curious.
- Okay, I gotta go talk to her.

830
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,478
- I gotta go make a move.
- Let's get her over here.

831
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,938
- We can ask questions.
- Oh, no, no, no.

832
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,982
- No, no, no, it'd be good.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

833
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,651
I'm gonna have one more drink
like a gentleman.

834
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,396
- I'm gonna walk over there...
- Let's get her over here.

835
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,255
- I think you're on the wrong page...
- Let's get her over here.

836
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,573
- Anna. Anna.
- You're an asshole.

837
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,492
What are you doing?
You forgot your purse.

838
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,285
- You're crazy. Get over here.
- What an asshole.

839
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,413
You know Marty.
You remember my friend Marty.

840
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,239
- Don't say it to me like I'm retarded.
- You forgot your...

841
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,666
MARTY: In your falsetto,
condescending voice.

842
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,710
AJ: Get over here.
You remember my little friend Marty.

843
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,421
REEVES: - Wow.
ELISE: - You're in luck.

844
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,673
- I don't even smoke.
- What? You used to smoke like a chimney

845
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,591
- in high school.
- I know. I quit.

846
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,094
I don't even remember
the last time I bought a pack.

847
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,512
Well, Why'd you buy that one?

848
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,307
I don't know. I woke up this morning
and suddenly had the urge.

849
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,435
- No, no, thanks.
- Are you kidding me?

850
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,769
You just asked me if I had one.

851
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,841
Yes, because I wanted to get out
of there and I knew that you smoked.

852
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,314
- I don't smoke.
- No?

853
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,025
Mm-mm.

854
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:51,947
Come on.

855
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,532
- Just take one.
- Just be a bad influence, now.

856
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,075
Loser, everybody's doing it.

857
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,119
I've... honestly, I've never had
a cigarette in my entire life.

858
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,205
How is that even possible?

859
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:04,334
Aren't you supposed to be like,
this rock star?

860
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,713
I'm not a rock star.
I'm just a musician.

861
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,217
Traveling minstrel.

862
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,719
Nice.

863
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,056
So where's the Austin guy?

864
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,559
Huh?

865
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,311
- Where's he at?
- I don't know.

866
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,897
- We haven't spoken in years.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

867
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:27,733
It's okay.
It's in the past.

868
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,818
And what about the present?

869
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,571
- What about the present?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

870
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,823
Uh-huh.

871
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:40,704
- Long distance again?
- No, actually. Same city.

872
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,831
Well, where is he?

873
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,084
He's in Chicago
at a partners' meeting.

874
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,296
He's a partner.
He's a lawyer.

875
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,381
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Wow.

876
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,802
- Older?
- Yeah.

877
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,428
- How much older?
- Older.

878
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,097
Okay.

879
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,016
How'd you meet?

880
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,811
I... I sold his house.

881
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,273
Okay, let me guess.
He's divorced?

882
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,235
Okay, he's divorced.

883
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,946
The wife got the kids,
he got the house.

884
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,198
But he thought
it was too big for him, right?

885
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,953
So he just wanted like, a cooler,
smaller bachelor pad in the city,

886
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,455
somewhere in a high-rise?

887
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,374
- Nope.
- No?

888
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,544
No, no.
His new house is much bigger.

889
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,172
(Music plays)

890
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,560
NICK: - Those are different.
(gasps)

891
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,603
- Stop.
- It's this machine.

892
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,397
Are you getting everybody
on that, by the way?

893
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,898
- I'm trying to.
- 'Cause I just...

894
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,942
I can't just have it be your clique.
I need everybody.

895
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,319
You're right. You're right. And I think
there's a lesson in there for me.

896
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,321
JULIE:
Oh, good.

897
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,073
ANNA: Is that
his mother's earring?

898
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,783
Look, it looks like
a mother-of-pearl.

899
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,869
- He got away with that. Nobody ever...
- I know, right?

900
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,495
Back then it was, like,
that's how cool he is.

901
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,747
He could wear, like...
he could dress like a Village Person

902
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,292
- and still be cool.
(Anna laughs)

903
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,252
You had this amazing glow
in high school.

904
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,671
Yeah.
All these pictures. Crazy.

905
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,548
Well, I'd like to think
I still have that glow.

906
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,300
- You do, I think.
- That's not what I...

907
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,343
- I think you do.
AJ: - That's not what I meant.

908
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,391
Oh, man.
Oh, no.

909
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,268
- Yep.
- Can we not?

910
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,853
That was senior year.

911
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,314
- That was four days ago.
- Look how tiny you were.

912
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,940
(AJ laughs)
- Isn't it sad?

913
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,567
I was a tween.
I was still a tween.

914
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,112
I remember that day.
I got my first pube

915
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,531
and I thought I was turning into
a ﬂy-human hybrid

916
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,241
'cause I watched
too much science fiction.

917
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,244
- You're so funny.
- Well, thanks.

918
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,497
Clearly you had a much better time
in high school than I did.

919
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,458
I had a much better time
in high school than you did.

920
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,294
In fact, I think I had a much better
time in high school than anybody did.

921
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,546
What was the secret?

922
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,382
My mother actually...
she taught me very early on

923
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,468
how to have a very good time.

924
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,137
Wherever she is now,
she's probably drunk, having a blast.

925
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,513
JULIE:
Photo op!

926
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,224
That's why
whatever high school taught us,

927
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,101
I'll always remember
my very first lesson.

928
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,562
- Cheese.
- Yay!

929
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,231
- Can I get a copy of that?
- Let me see it.

930
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,785
- Should be one more.
- Oh, I gotta take this off.

931
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,984
- No, that's beautiful.
- And my eyes are a little closed.

932
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,569
- Do you want a hand with that?
- Here, I got it. I can get it.

933
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,279
Okay.

934
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,281
- All right. All righty.
- Okay.

935
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,325
- So much better.
JULIE: - Gorgeous.

936
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,618
- Ready?
JULIE: - All right, guys.

937
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,411
One, two, three.

938
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,829
JULIE: Cheese.

939
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,206
Oh, love it!

940
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,375
Can I get a fresh one?

941
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,090
You have a TV out here
or just the one back at the bar?

942
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,092
I'm sorry, sir.
The TV's actually in the bar.

943
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,510
Okay.

944
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,429
You ain't no Jake, bro.

945
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,349
Hey, honey.
Thanks for getting me a drink.

946
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,767
- Is he kidding?
- Let me get you a drink.

947
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,060
- No, it's fine.
- You sure?

948
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,688
Yeah, no. I just would like my husband
to ask me if I'd like a drink.

949
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,023
- It would be a nice gesture.
- You're the one that let him drink.

950
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,484
Let him drink? He's a big boy.
I'm not his babysitter.

951
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,778
Oh, come on. You know you're
his babysitter, so don't even...

952
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,947
- let's go look at pictures.
- Why don't you go be his babysitter?

953
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,282
- So I can have a night off.
- I think we're gonna...

954
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,135
babe, we're just gonna stay here
and have a little girl time.

955
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,785
- Okay. All right.
- Love you.

956
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,705
Wait, wait, look. This is Andre.

957
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,291
- That's funny. Yeah.
- He's dancing with his sister.

958
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,503
GARRITY:
Oh, my gosh.

959
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,968
Oh, my God.
Is that you?

960
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,348
Yep, that's me.

961
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,976
Well, there it is.

962
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,061
GARRITY:
Yep. There it is.

963
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,480
"G-Money."

964
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,359
GARRITY: That's my friend,
Brock, right there.

965
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,653
And with the "B.U.M. Equipment"
is Ross.

966
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,572
- Where'd you go?
OLIVIA: - Oh, I'm just...

967
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,074
seeing if I can get
any more "G-Money."

968
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,000
(sighs)

969
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,090
Hmm.

970
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,092
Shit.

971
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,345
Why's it feel so long ago?

972
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,681
(Chuckling)

973
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,851
Uh-huh.
Sassy.

974
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,563
Look at that.
Was that Christmas?

975
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,065
MARY: Yeah, it was.

976
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,903
And this was prom.

977
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,369
I guess so.

978
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,455
You know, I got my tiara like,
two, three weeks later.

979
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,173
Sorry you didn't get to wear it.

980
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,344
I wore it.

981
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,305
It was only in my room, but...

982
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,891
(chuckles)
- I wore it.

983
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,894
No, sorry.

984
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,190
No.

985
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,150
You don't wanna go over there?

986
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,693
No.

987
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,905
Do you wanna go over there?

988
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,157
I love you.

989
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,161
- Right?
- Mm-mm.

990
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,746
No.

991
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,165
I love each and all of you.
Thank you for accepting my apology.

992
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,377
Allowing us to be
besties again...

993
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,379
for the first time.

994
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,089
PETER: - It's fine.
- It is fine. It's great.

995
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,924
It's better than fine.
It's awesome.

996
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,594
Because if you didn't accept my apology,
I would have to force you to.

997
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,597
But I wouldn't use my fists,
'cause I ain't like that.

998
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,016
- I'd use my tongue.
- Sorry.

999
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,102
CULLY: Not only that,
it wouldn't be violent.

1000
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,271
It would be tender.
(chuckles)

1001
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,148
You would be like my cell mate.

1002
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,191
- And I would swallow...
- Oh, God.

1003
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,277
My pride.

1004
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,404
Sicko.

1005
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:51,783
Get your little funny-shaped head
out of the gutter there, chipmunk.

1006
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,579
- What is your problem?
- Honey.

1007
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,789
What? He knows I'm joking.

1008
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,292
He know... come on, come here.
You know I'm kidding, right?

1009
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,002
MAN: No, no. No, no.
Please...

1010
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,211
- Come on, hug it out.
- Honey...

1011
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,421
CULLY: I don't think you look
like a chipmunk.

1012
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,756
(Groans) I just can't...

1013
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:11,011
Hey, hey, Peter.
Hi. I'm sorry that...

1014
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,471
thanks for being
such a good sport.

1015
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,724
I... you know... I know he can be
a little aggressive and,

1016
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,727
you know, he's had
one too many drinks.

1017
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:21,021
But he really means well

1018
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:24,232
and he really is
such a sweet guy.

1019
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,318
And I know it was really important
to him to talk to you.

1020
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,738
No, no, no. it's...
I'm sorry.

1021
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,866
'Cause you must have
to say this to a lot of people.

1022
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,326
Huh?

1023
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,787
I... I have to go.

1024
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,917
REEVES: So, if I want a new house,
I should call you.

1025
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,794
Whatever.
I'm sure you need all sorts of houses

1026
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,547
for all those baby mamas
and groupies.

1027
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,757
Baby mamas?

1028
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,343
No, baby mamas get
their own baby mama condos,

1029
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,929
typically, and the groupies
are more of a road thing.

1030
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,972
Please, can I see your tour bus?

1031
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,517
"Never Had" is, like,
the best song of all time.

1032
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,102
- Yeah?
- Totally. Totes.

1033
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,941
- Best song?
- Ever.

1034
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,198
That song...

1035
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:17,327
I wrote it in like, two hours
and it barely made the album.

1036
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,579
It's kind of crazy
how people like it so much.

1037
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1038
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,214
Have you never heard the song?

1039
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:32,884
Yeah. What?
(laughs)

1040
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,721
I... I mean, you just
have to understand that...

1041
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,392
lam in the car all the time
'cause of my job.

1042
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,562
- Uh-huh.
- And I've got satellite radio,

1043
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,481
but I'm more of a talk radio
kind of girl.

1044
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,942
Uh-huh.

1045
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:52,445
You know what? I bet if I heard it,
I would recognize it.

1046
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,907
I'm sure.
I'm sure if I heard it, I'd know it.

1047
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,161
The truth is,
I was only distantly aware

1048
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,414
that you were a musician.

1049
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,880
It's okay. It's all right.

1050
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,344
You're just... you're just telling me
that you're not with it.

1051
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,305
- Right?
- Sorry.

1052
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,141
It's all right.
Don't apologize.

1053
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,351
Hey, I really would love
to hear you play.

1054
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,188
It's pathetic
that I haven't heard you.

1055
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,610
It's not. No, it's not.
It's not pathetic.

1056
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,903
It just means that...

1057
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,156
that you're one of the few people here
that's talking to me

1058
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,867
because of who I was,
not because of who I am.

1059
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,873
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1060
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,626
So...

1061
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,878
how many times
has he been divorced?

1062
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,882
- Twice.
- Twice?

1063
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,218
Third time's a charm.
That's what they say, right?

1064
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,137
Neither of us
want to get married, so...

1065
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,930
You don't want to get married?

1066
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,185
No? You don't wanna be
someone's wife someday?

1067
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,148
You don't wanna be
someone's third wife someday?

1068
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:15,153
It's cold.
Let's go inside.

1069
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,993
Well, well, well.
Where have you been all night?

1070
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,038
Just taking care
of my third child.

1071
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,498
Let's just get drunk.

1072
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,500
- I can't. I have to drive.
- Oh, crap. Sorry.

1073
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,210
Mary? Mary?

1074
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,836
(Gasps)
Wait. This... oh.

1075
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,546
- Come here. Hey.
- Scott.

1076
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,256
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.

1077
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,550
I heard you weren't gonna be here
and then I heard that you were and...

1078
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,219
- This is my husband.
PAUL: - How are you?

1079
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,846
- Scott. It's a... pull up a chair.
SAM: - How's your night been?

1080
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,058
Great, actually.
It's been really trippy

1081
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,686
to look through
all these photographs

1082
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,521
and realize how old
we've gotten.

1083
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,855
- We're not that old.
MARY: - This one's finding out all my

1084
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,149
- secrets and tricks and everything.
- I feel old.

1085
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,777
ANNA: No, you definitely
didn't ask me to prom, AJ.

1086
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,239
I would've remembered it.
Definitely.

1087
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:01,783
You sure I never asked you?
I had to have asked you.

1088
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,702
No.

1089
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,329
Jason Maclntyre, Mike Brighty,

1090
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,748
Gabe Vertz asked me.

1091
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,875
You asked me to prom.

1092
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,169
But never you, AJ

1093
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,296
Oh, the carcass is ﬂoating
in the water already.

1094
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,216
Who'd you finally say yes to?
You went with a college guy.

1095
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,884
I went with a guy
who wasn't in our class.

1096
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,053
You went with a college guy.
So boring.

1097
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,221
Anyway, I thought prom
was kind of boring.

1098
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,015
- Sort of like a waste of time.
- No. No, no.

1099
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,059
- Prom was awesome.
MARTY: - I hated prom.

1100
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,436
I had the most miserable time,
but I don't think it was a waste...

1101
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,564
I think that's the point of prom...
to have a miserable time, right?

1102
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,149
I went with Jenny Sakamora.

1103
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,067
- Remember Jenny Sakamora?
- Wow.

1104
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,028
MARTY: She looked like one of
the Sand People in Star Wars.

1105
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,114
And the worst breath...
you can't believe this breath.

1106
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,575
And she wouldn't kiss me. That was
the irony. Wouldn't kiss me all night.

1107
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:47,078
I don't think it was a waste of time.
That's kind of the point.

1108
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,714
I think it's supposed to be,
like, a rite of passage.

1109
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,791
I mean, can you imagine not being
disappointed at your prom?

1110
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,585
Seriously.

1111
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:56,004
Well, I mean... sorry.
You guys excluded.

1112
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,047
I'm sure you guys
weren't disappointed at prom.

1113
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,342
You genetic...
you genetic superhumans.

1114
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,428
- Ahem...
- What?

1115
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:07,682
- We didn't go, man. Remember?
- Yeah.

1116
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,561
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1117
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,147
Why's he apologizing?

1118
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,608
Well, actually,
I didn't make it to prom because

1119
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:20,653
that was the first time
Dad had a heart attack.

1120
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,407
And so we just...
we didn't make it.

1121
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,452
We actually spent... I spent prom
in a hospital room with Jake.

1122
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,915
PAUL: Oh.

1123
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,586
Dude, we're going to Pretzels.

1124
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,963
We're all going to Pretzels.
Let's go.

1125
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,840
Oh, look. It's my husband,
the event coordinator.

1126
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,133
CULLY: - Let's go!
- Oh, no.

1127
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,551
We're not... we're not really
going to Pretzels, are we?

1128
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,345
CULLY:
Yes, we are! Yes, we are.

1129
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,932
How is it possible that I'm not
in any of these pictures?

1130
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,101
It's like I didn't even go to school
with you guys.

1131
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,436
Maybe you don't really exist.

1132
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:56,189
I was very camera-shy, maybe.

1133
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,859
No, there's one.
There's gotta be one somewhere.

1134
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,778
I don't know.

1135
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,113
Anna.
We're doing shots.

1136
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,573
One more before Pretzels.

1137
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,158
I just need to steal her
for one photo.

1138
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,493
- Yeah, one photo.
- Real quick.

1139
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,870
Come back, though.
We're gonna be here.

1140
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,877
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you talking about?

1141
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,379
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

1142
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,881
You're flirting with her.
All night you've been ﬂirting with her.

1143
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,716
Don't be an asshole.

1144
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,219
I'm not being an asshole.
I just want... you're married.

1145
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,887
You remember, you're married
and you have a boat.

1146
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,264
I just wanted to make sure
you know that.

1147
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,015
- I do remember, Marty.
- You remember? Good, good, good.

1148
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,560
- I just want to make sure you remember.
- I especially remember.

1149
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,979
What does that mean,
"I especially remember"?

1150
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:40,275
It means...
I don't get to...

1151
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,571
- I don't get to do this.
- What are you talking about?

1152
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,738
- Do this?
- What do you care?

1153
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,074
You sleep with models.

1154
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,010
I slept with a model.

1155
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,345
Once, okay?

1156
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,763
No, I'm saying.
I'm just...

1157
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,932
- And she was a plus-sized model.
- What?

1158
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,476
What?

1159
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,979
You didn't tell me that.

1160
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,606
Whatever,
she was a plus-sized model.

1161
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:20,940
- You didn't tell me...
- She was still a model, okay?

1162
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,108
She was still a model.

1163
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,526
I found you.

1164
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,153
You did?
(gasps)

1165
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,280
You "Oh, my gosh"!

1166
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,073
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

1167
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,575
REEVES: I love blurred
in the background.

1168
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,369
I forgot about those yellow shoes.

1169
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,830
- You forgot about 'em?
- Oh, wow.

1170
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,166
- I didn't.
- I was obsessed with...

1171
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,920
those were the first designer anything
I ever bought.

1172
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,297
- I wore those all the time.
- Yeah, I remember.

1173
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:47,258
I'd wear those in gym class
if they let me.

1174
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,639
Oh.
Look at me.

1175
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,224
Even there I look like
I just can't wait to get out.

1176
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,226
- Yeah.
- I would've never guessed

1177
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:00,730
that I'd come to something like this
ten years later.

1178
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,318
How come you did?

1179
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,655
- Mmm.
- You don't know?

1180
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,657
Whoa!

1181
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,493
REEVES:
Oh, my God. Dude.

1182
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,162
You coming to Pretzels,
you little bitch? Let's go to Pretzels.

1183
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,997
- You're going to Pretzels right now?
- I was talking to him, not to you.

1184
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,582
- Oh. Yeah.
- Come on. But you can come.

1185
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,000
- I'm not calling you a bitch.
- Oh, thanks. That's really nice.

1186
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,609
- You guys are going right now?
- Come on! Pretzels!

1187
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,462
Okay. Okay.

1188
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,341
You... you wanna
come to Pretzels?

1189
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:31,052
Why would I need
to feel better about myself?

1190
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:32,845
That's exactly my point.
You don't, AJ.

1191
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,973
You own a frickin' boat,
so I don't know what you're doing.

1192
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,724
What... what is wrong
with you and the boat?

1193
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:37,934
You're acting
like a crazy person.

1194
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,853
Oh, yeah. I'm acting like a... shh.
Hey.

1195
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,689
You ready to go?
A little Pretzels?

1196
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:45,984
(Sighs)
I left my fake I.D. at home.

1197
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,528
(laughs)
You're gonna need that.

1198
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,447
Sorry, guys.

1199
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,907
You're not coming?

1200
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,076
That doesn't sound like
the Anna we remember.

1201
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,620
Yeah, the Anna in those pictures
would never leave a party early.

1202
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:59,580
- Come on.
- The Anna in those pictures

1203
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,416
- was the party.
- Yeah, right.

1204
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,293
Wait. We're good?

1205
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,714
You're a big city boy now.
Let's see how you do on your own.

1206
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:15,096
Hey, you guys. We're going to Pretzels.
You guys going to Pretzels?

1207
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,141
Pretzels? Moving on? Pretzels?
You guys going to Pretzels?

1208
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:19,804
Oh, you guys gotta sign
the memory book before you go.

1209
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:20,893
- Oh...
- Just sign it.

1210
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,448
- We're gonna miss...
- Nope, you got two seconds.

1211
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:25,064
- Just sign it. You gotta sign it.
- Come on, let's sign it.

1212
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,566
- Uh...
CULLY: - Hey, Jake.

1213
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,901
Yo, Jake.
Let's do it, bro.

1214
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,906
(laughing)
- Oh, my God.

1215
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,575
CULLY:
The thing broke.

1216
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,037
- Are you all right?
- Nope, I'm good.

1217
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,664
Get on the couch.
Go sit on the couch.

1218
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,542
Julie?

1219
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:45,835
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

1220
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,546
- No, I didn't...
- Go apologize to Julie.

1221
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,548
- Are you gonna apologize to her?
MARY: - What happened?

1222
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,551
Nothing happened other than Sam
is actually gonna kill him, I think.

1223
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:54,844
SAM:
No, I don't have your jacket.

1224
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,517
Uh, look. I just gotta tell you.
I'm happy you decided to come.

1225
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,605
Can I tell you something?

1226
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:08,441
You're the only reason I did.

1227
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,614
I'll see you at Pretzels.

1228
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,449
Okay.

1229
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,661
You did an amazing job, Julie.

1230
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,830
- Really? You sure?
- Don't worry about it.

1231
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,459
Ah, ha ha.
Scotty P, "Sukiwaba."

1232
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,461
Let's go to Pretzels
and find some victims.

1233
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,171
- Arf, arf, arf.
- Oh, God.

1234
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,298
Pretzels? Yeah.

1235
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:33,925
Pretzels?
Bye, Snoopy.

1236
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,177
- Bye, Snoops.
- Pretzels.

1237
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,304
Let's go, baby.
Ow!

1238
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,349
AJ: I don't understand
why she's leaving already.

1239
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,059
She's too fun to be leaving.

1240
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,144
Without one of us, you mean.

1241
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,859
Would you-I mean, honestly.

1242
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,612
Would you have actually
gone home with her?

1243
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,990
I just wanted to know
I could've...

1244
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,785
if I wanted to.

1245
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,330
You know?

1246
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:06,999
- Right.
- But that's...

1247
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,168
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I get it.

1248
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,216
You okay, pal?

1249
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:22,098
(Sighs) You're right.

1250
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,518
I shouldn't have
bought the boat.

1251
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,188
- It was stupid. I...
- You wanted a boat.

1252
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,441
No, I just... I've taken
the boat out one time.

1253
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:35,778
I don't even have access
to water where I live. It doesn't...

1254
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,488
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

1255
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,366
Well, you gave it a shot.
I don't know why, but...

1256
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,327
I can't even pretend to be
a boat guy.

1257
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,456
You wanted a boat.
Pfft.

1259
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,798
I want that boat.

1260
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,343
- You know what we should do?
- Huh?

1261
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,598
We should follow her home.

1262
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,726

00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,143
I'll see you in a little bit.

1311
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:14,729
Do you wanna go outside
and have a cigarette?

1312
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,522
- Yes. Yes, please.
- You do?

1313
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:17,940
Okay, let's go.

FRANTZ:
G-Money's in the house.

1351
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:56,163
Haven't done that in a while.

1352
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,793
What?

1353
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,504
That was insane.

1354
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:07,800

00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,469
Yeah. Really?

1356
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

1357
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,194
Hi.

1358
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,241
I hate that there's always
a line for the girls.

1359
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,910
I know. It's so unfair.

1360

00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,331
No. Jake and I
used to race each other.

00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,001
I'm quick.

1363
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:44,795
Now I'm gonna have to be quick, though.
Since I said that.

1364
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,964
(Stall door bangs)

1365
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,633

All right, slow down.

1368
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,563
- Kill the lights.
- Oh, shit.

1369
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,984
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

1370

AJ:
No, no, no.

1371
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:11,780
MARTY: Why does that house
look so familiar?

1372
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,866
I feel like we've been here before.

1373
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,701
- Really?
- Wait a minute.

1374
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:19,121
Dude, that's... I think that's
the house she grew up in.

1375
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,042
Yeah.

1376
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,085
Well, it's a nice house.

1377
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,921
Yeah.

1378
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,675
What do we do?
We just wait for her to go to bed?

1379
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,802
Let's... let's get supplies.

1380
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,221
Okay.

1381
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:39,016
Let's get a lot of supplies. I want to
paint this house whiter than a...

1382
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:42,770
- A Jimmy Buffet concert?
- A Jimmy Buffet concert.

1383
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:46,232
- A Phish show.
- Fo' sho.

1384
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,151
No, a Phish show.
Like the band Phish.

1385
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:50,945
AJ:
Fo' shizo.

(Jake laughing)

1388
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,544
I don't know
if that was horribly good

1389
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,462
or horribly bad
or horribly amazing.

1390
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:09,636
- Amazing.
- I know she was amazing,

1391
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:11,423
but I'm not sure
about you and Frantz.

1392
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,634
She's amazing, isn't she?
I told you she was amazing.

1393
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,928
You're next, Jake.
And you're gonna do it with me, too.

1394
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,721
SUKI: - Yeah, you're next.
- Hey, hey.

1395
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,765
Hey.

1396
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:22,893
- Where you been?
- Baby, I think I'm gonna go.

1397
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,604
- What? No.
- Yeah. No, it's fine.

1398
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,566
It's totally fine.
I'm just really tired.

1399
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,109
Okay, okay. All right.
Let me just say bye to everybody.

1400
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:31,443
No, no.
I want you to stay.

1401
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,112
- No, I want him to stay.
- We just met you.

1402
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,912
- I want you to catch up.
- I'm not gonna stay without you.

1403
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,949
I swear to God,
I'm just really tired.

1404
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:40,119
It's fine.
It's totally fine. It's fine.

1405
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,371
Just give me one minute.
I'm gonna talk to her.

1406
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:44,623
I'm not even gonna say goodbye.
'Cause I'll see you in a minute.

1407
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:51,755
(Scanner beeping)

1408
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,134
MARTY: - Thank you.
AJ: - Thanks, Case.

1409
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,928
You have no idea
what we're gonna do with this.

1410
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,222
No idea.
How are we...

1411
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:03,183
We're gonna be wiping
our asses for years.

1412
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,394
How are we gonna carry
all these?

1413
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,147
Oh, shit.
That's a good point.

1414
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,650
Hey, Casey. Do you sell these
in a much bigger package?

1415
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,485
Make it easier to carry?

1416
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:16,488
I mean, like a 72-count pack?

1417
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,034
No?

1418
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,577
Look, if you wanna go,
let's just go.

1419
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,495
No, I want to go.
I don't want you to go.

1420
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,290
No, I don't care.
I'm not gonna just stay here.

1421
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:28,584
Oh, my God.
Please let me have the keys.

1422
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:30,628
- No. Why?
- Can I have the keys?

1423
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,005
- Tell me why.
- Why? I'm tired.

1424
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:36,216
- That's it.
- But why?

1425
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,843
What's... what is the deal?

1426
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,511
Okay.

1427
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:43,057
- What happened?
- With what?

1428
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:45,476
Come on.

1429
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,811
You know,
I know everything about her.

1430
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,355
But I don't know
why you guys broke up.

1431
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,482
You've never told me
what happened.

1432
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,364
I don't know.

1433
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,204
Her dad died.

1434
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,540
So she stayed here
and I stayed with her.

1435
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,797
And I don't...
things got really serious after that.

1436
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,928
I don't know.
I stayed as long as I could...

1437
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,390
till I just couldn't stay any more.

1438
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,810
I just needed to go to college
and grow up.

1439
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,064
So have you grown up now?

1440
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,651
What... what kind of-come on.
What... I don't...

1441
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:38,570
I really don't understand.
What you want me to say here?

1442
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,031
- Okay, let's just go.
- I don't want you to go.

1443
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,866
- I don't...
- I don't want you to go.

1444
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,369
Jake, I don't want you to go.

1445
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,831
It's your 10-year reunion.

1446
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,958
Just go inside.
I'm tired.

1447
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,876
Come back when you're ready.

1448
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,676
(Engine starts)

1449
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,596
(music continues)

1450
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,265
DRE:
Uh-oh.

1451
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:09,601
Garrity, now that's what I call
a rump roast.

1452
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,478
OLIVIA:
No, I get down.

1453
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,356
Hey.
Your girl got a little bit,

1454
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,316
but she's shakin' what she's got.

1455
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,943
GARRITY: She got some moves,
doesn't she?

1456
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,945
DRE: - Yeah.
- They're my new friends.

1457
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,530
GARRITY: - Have fun.
- I'm her new friend.

1458
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,115
OLIVIA:
I have new friends.

1459
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:25,993
- You locked down a good one.
- Yeah, I know.

1460
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,580
DRE: Now me...
I'm about to go on a safari.

1461
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:30,748
(laughs)

1462
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:34,168
You're really never gonna
settle down, are you?

1463
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,838
Nah.
I tried already.

1464
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,257
GARRITY:
Yeah? What happened?

1465
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,762
Didn't stick.

1466
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,477
OLIVIA:
They love me. I'm fun.

1467
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,106
Come here, girl.
Mmm-mm.

1468
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,027
Come on, man.
Get in this.

1469
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,487
Okay, that was fun.
That was fun.

1470
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,071
- What are we doing next?
- Yeah.

1471
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:05,824
SUKI: - Vanilla Ice?
SCOTT: - Ooh, genius. I like that.

1472
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,537
- So no go with Jess?
- She was tired.

1473
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,498
(Scott groans)

1474
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,753
- You all right, man?
- Mm-hmm.

1475
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,171
- What?
- Hey, guys.

1476
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:21,340
- What's up?
- Oh, look who decides to hang out

1477
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,842
- for a second.
- Yeah. What's going on?

1478
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,677
You're in town for one night.

1479
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,721
And we haven't seen you once.
What's going on?

1480
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,264
- You guilting me?
- Maybe a little bit, yeah.

1481
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,557
Aww.

1482
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,018
SCOTT: - Who's the girl?
- Elise?

1483
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,020
Mm-hmm.
Who's Elise?

1484
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:36,313
What do you mean,
"Who's Elise"?

1485
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,023
REEVES: - We went to school with her.
- Yeah, man.

1486
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,192
Physics class.
Mr. Ferguson.

1487
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,696
Nope, nothing.

1488
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,032
What's going on with Mary?
How's it going?

1489
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,576
JAKE: What do you mean,
"How's it going"?

1490
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,037
Is she how you remember her?

1491
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,915
No.

1492
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,375
No?

1493
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,336
- But no one is, so...
- I know.

1494
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,046
- It's weird.
- It's cool.

1495
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,257
- It's cool?
- Yeah, I like it.

1496
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,758
You're so weird.

1497
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,718
(AJ, Marty
laughing, whispering)

1498
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,557
AJ:
Oh, shit.

1499
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,935
This one's for
the Goo Goo Dolls.

1500
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,689
MARTY:
This one's for Darfur.

1501
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:21,233
It's so soft. I can't wait to use it
on my ass later.

1502
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,235
AJ: Should we use eggs?
Should we use eggs? Too much?

1503
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,737
- I think we're good for now.
- Okay.

1504
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,072
- Thanks.
- Let's do it at the same time.

1505
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,448
- Okay.
- Give yourself a little tail.

1506
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,367
- It's really nice.
- Oh, that's a good tail.

1507
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,618
How long is your tail?

1508
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,830
- See, my tail keeps breaking off.
- That's a good tail.

1509
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:37,249
- Okay, you ready?
- Fo' sho!

1510
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,211
(laughing)

1511
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,631
- So much.
- There's so much already.

1512
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,925
- It's actually kind of beautiful.
- It's really beautiful.

1513
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:53,599
- I hope she finds the beauty in it.
- I think she will.

1514
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,893
BARTENDER: Get your money out,
people. Don't be shy.

1515
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,811
- I'm still waiting on that beer, bro.
- Get your money out.

1516
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:59,688
I mean, you got the time here.

1517
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:01,690
BARTENDER: - What do you need?
MAN: - Yo, what's the holdup?

1518
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:04,026
BARTENDER: - I see you.
- Hey.

1519
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,738
Where's... where's Paul?

1520
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:10,449
Um, early day tomorrow.

1521
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:14,119
- So called it a night.
- Mm.

1522
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,913
Jer.
(slapping)

1523
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,706
SCOTT: - Jer?
- Where's Jess?

1524
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:19,875
Uh, same.

1525
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,627
Tired.

1526
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:24,254
Tired.
She went back to the hotel.

1527
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,883
I think they're both tired
of our 10-year reunion.

1528
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,051
I would be.

1529
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,594
- Jen
MARY: - They should've shared a cab.

1530
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,680
JAKE: - That would've been awkward.
- There's only one of me.

1531
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,807
Excuse me, miss.
I'm so sorry.

1532
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,186
I'm going in.

1533
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:42,064
- Who wants a drink?
JERRY: - What are you doing?

1534
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,316
SCOTT: Baby, you in the weeds.
I'm just helping you out, all right?

1535
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,860
JERRY: - Everybody pays. Everybody pays.
- Yes, sir.

1536
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,820
JERRY: Okay.
Who's next? Get your money out.

1537
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,406
- Uh, beer.
- What kind of beer? Bud?

1538
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,659
- Bud's fine.
- That's fine? Good.

1539
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,702
There you go. Bam.
Done. Mary, you?

1540
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,120
Um, just water.

1541
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,915
- You better be driving.
- I am driving.

1542
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,334
All right, all right. Water it is.
You fine, you fine.

1543
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,961
(Register beeps)
- Baby, what do you want?

1544
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,380
- Jack and Coke.
- Jack and Coke? Jack and Coke.

1545
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,257
Man, I made some serious drinks
while I was over in Japan.

1546
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,510
- I'm keeping all the tips.
- Amazing drinks.

1547
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,053
I'm serious.
I'm definitely gonna come visit you.

1548
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,846
(Scott laughs)
- I promise.

1549
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:17,391
I know I've been saying it,
but I'm gonna come before you leave.

1550
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,559
- For sure.
- All right. I'm gonna hold you to that.

1551
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,853
- Wow.
- Done.

1552
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,563
When are you coming back?

1553
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,940
All night long,
I get that question.

1554
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:27,025
You know what?
You wanna hear a dirty secret?

1555
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,569
I might never come back.

1556
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:35,117
This might be the last time
anybody ever sees Scotty P in Pretzels.

1557
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:39,329
So you're just gonna leave? You're not
gonna come see your family,

1558
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,707
- your parents any more?
- Parents are retiring, man.

1559
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:45,711
Both of 'em, this year.
So they're contemplating moving over.

1560
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,462
MARY: - Wow.
- What do you need?

1561
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:50,215
That's crazy.
And kind of sad.

1562
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:52,300
SCOTT:
No, no, no.

1563
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,594
I love the fact that I got to
come back with Suki.

1564
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,389
But you know, I loved high school,
I loved college,

1565
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:59,266
and now I love Japan, man.

1566
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:01,268
I love everything that I've been able
to do in my life.

1567
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,895
And, you know what? I'm probably
gonna love what I do next, right?

1568
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,897
Whatever happens.

1569
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,315
So...

1570
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,693
Why spend your time
looking back

1571
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,611
when you've got so much
to look forward to?

1572
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:14,114
You know what I'm saying?
Crazy, yeah.

1573
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:17,451
Sad? Pfft.
No. No way.

1574
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,244

I'm doing it.

1615
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,966
I'm actually
allergic to pretzels, so...

1616
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,594
- So...
- Being here is really dangerous for me.

1617
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,637
REEVES:
So your tongue is swelling up?

1618
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,472
- No, I have...
- That's important information.

1619
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:45,891
CULLY:
Reeves, they have your song.

1620
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,976
- Reeves!
- What's up?

1621
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,437
They have "Never Had."
They have "Never Had"!

1622
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:54,649
Oh, Jesus.

1623
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,902
They have your song
in the karaoke machine.

1624
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,737
I want you to sing it.

1625
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,030
- Really? You're gonna do this...
- I would love it...

1626
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:02,240
I actually would love it
if you sang the song.

1627
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,951
Everybody, Reeves.
Who wants Reeves to sing the song?

1628
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,536
(cheering)

1629
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,955
Reeves!

1630
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,166
- You're gonna make me do this?
- I'm not gonna make you do it.

1631
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,834
I would really love it if you did.

1632
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,170
- You're singing it.
ELISE: - Come on.

1633
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:16,588
You should've lied.
You should've said that you heard it

1634
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,923
and that you liked it a lot.

1635
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,758
I probably should have.

1636
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,843
You definitely should have
'cause then I wouldn't have to do this.

1637
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,845
(Applause)
CULLY: - Yeah!

1638
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,481
CULLY: Get up there,
Ricky Martin. Let's go.

1639
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:36,441
- Jesus.
(music plays)

1640
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,611
Give a hand to Cully,
ladies and gentlemen.

1641
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,447
That's a big act to follow.

1642
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,074
That's right.

1643
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,293
Never karaoke'd myself before.
This is very weird.

1644
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,677
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna stop.

1645
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:04,928
(Crowd boos) (recording stops)

1646
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,180
REEVES: Sorry, I...
Jerry, do you have a guitar?

1647
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,557
- You got a guitar back there?
- Oh, yeah.

1648
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:10,976
- You want that?
- Yeah, bring it out.

1649
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:13,144
- Let's do it.
- All right. Let's do this right.

1650
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,771
- I'm gonna sing.
(crowd cheering)

1651
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,706
Check, check.

1652
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,546
Okay.

Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

1697
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,310
(Cully yelling)
That's for you, Mary!

1698
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:25,104
Yeah! Shots!

1699
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,987
- So that's your big hit song?
- That's my big hit song.

1700
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:40,912
I didn't know you remembered
anything about me,

1701
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,456
let alone could write
a song about me.

1702
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,708
Really?

1703
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:51,673
Well, there was that...
moment in the parking lot.

1704
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,008
- The parking lot, yeah.
- After that basketball game.

1705
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,843
Yeah, there was that moment.

1706
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:59,472
I got scared.
I had my boyfriend.

1707
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:01,849
Boyfriend in Austin.

1708
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,018
Now you have
a boyfriend in Chicago.

1709
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,771
Yeah.

1710
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,736
(sighs)

1711
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,575
I should go.

1712
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,495
Getting scared again?

1713
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,747
- Little bit.
- I'll walk you out.

1714
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,087
MARTY: Hey, Anna.
Should we wait outside?

1715
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:35,925
(mumbling)

1716
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:43,099
You guys are 28 years old.
Do you remember that?

1717
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,436
Sorry.

1718
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:49,105
Is that what you do in New York now?
Wrap people's houses?

1719
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,815
- No.
- Is that how you roll now, Marty?

1720
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,984
- I don't...
- I know this is hard to believe,

1721
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:56,321
but a couple of hours ago,
it seemed like a great idea.

1722
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:57,822
It did. I was there.
It really...

1723
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,282
You guys are gonna
clean all this up.

1724
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:00,700
- Of course, yeah.
- All of it.

1725
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,119
Absolutely. Every ply.
Every last little...

1726
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:04,787
- We should probably...
- We could start now.

1727
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,248
'Cause we got plenty of time
before our flight.

1728
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,335
Well, come in.
You're letting all the cold air in.

1729
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,420
Are you sure? We...

1730
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:16,633
- Thank you.
AJ: - So sorry again.

1731
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:20,845
So, does your mom still live here?

1732
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,515
I hope we didn't wake her up.
We tried to be quiet.

1733
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,643
- She's a deep sleeper.
MARTY: - Okay.

1734
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,102
AJ:
Cool.

1735
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:32,482
- It's nice... it's cool you're still...
BOY: - Mommy, you awake?

1736
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:35,860
Oh.
Was that a...

1737
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:42,158
Last call, people.
Last call.

1738
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,536
One more drink
and then the party is over.

1739
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,288
SCOTT: Peter, what do you want?
Last customer.

1740
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:50,249
- Vodka cranberry.
- Yeah.

1741
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:58,675
- You have fun tonight?
CULLY: - Yeah, it was pretty good.

1742
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,929
Yeah, it was fine.

1743
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,477
- Scotty?
- Yeah, baby.

1744
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:11,562
Look who's ready to have fun.

1745
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,398
- Shots.
- Shots.

1746
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,400
Shots. Three shots.

1747
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,568
- Let's do it.
- You, me, Jerry. Let's do it.

1748
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:21,489
Barkeep, Jerry,
let's go for it.

1749
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,908
- You're driving.
- Who says I'm driving?

1750
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,622
You want me to drive?
All right.

1751
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,584
Unbelievable.

1752
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,421
You're not the only one that
can get drunk, you know?

1753
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,756
Maybe there are some other people
at the bar

1754
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:41,426
that would like to throw back
some drinks and, you know,

1755
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:44,637
act like an asshole
and sing bad karaoke.

1756
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:49,142
You thought my karaoke was bad?

1757
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:51,519
Porter, come on, man. Are you
gonna take these shots with me or what?

1758
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:54,856
So here's to you.

1759
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,817
To my husband and your great night
and to us being the same age.

1760
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,110
Cheers.

1761
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,698
Oh, my God.

1762
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,117
You Okay?

1763
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:08,369
What was that?

1764
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,580
- It's whiskey. You want another one?
- No.

1765
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,043
Like you said, here's to me.

1766
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:20,173
SCOTT:
Sorry, Sam.

1767
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,430
SAM: So much for that being fun,
huh, Jerry?

1768
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,393
Peter?

1769
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,228
We gotta talk.

1770
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,938
Come here, dude.

1771
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,983
Come on.
We're buddies now.

1772
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,527
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not a douche any more.

1773
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,905
(Chuckles)

1774
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:48,242
Well, I guess that's...

1775
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,495
that's probably time.

1776
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:51,913
Yeah.

1777
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,499
I think that's it.

1778
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,338
Are you good?

1779
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,006
Are you good to get home?

1780
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:03,925
Yeah. Sober.

1781
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,178
MARY:
You?

1782
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,430
Uh, yeah.
I'm gonna figure it out.

1783
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,642
Okay.

1784
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,357
Come on, I'll walk you out.

1785
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,443
Um...

1786
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,195
I'm right behind you.

1787
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,323
Okay.

1788
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,707
- Hey, Jake?
- Yeah?

1789
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,921
I think you owe me a dance.

1790
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:50,221
Prom king.

1791
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:55,393
I owe you a dance?
Really?

1792
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,563
I want to dance.

1793
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,486
BOY: -Mommy?
ANNA: - I'll be right there, sweetie.

1794
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:07,280
BOY: Okay.

1795
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:08,948
(whispering)

1796
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,242
(door closes)

1797
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,495
(toy squeaks)

1798
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,250
Hey... I didn't even know
you had a child.

1799
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,338
MARTY:
Or children.

1800
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,718
I know.
It's because I didn't tell you.

1801
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,096
You want some milk?

1802
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:33,931
You want some milk, baby?

1803
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,642
(Cries)
- I know, I know.

1804
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,856
So you have just the two little

1805
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:44,650
whippersnappers or...

1806
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,279
We should...

1807
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,780
Hey, I think...

1808
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,784
- Urn, where's-
- We're so sorry, Anna.

1809
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,913
- So where's the dad, or is he...
AJ: - Marty.

1810
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,707
Which one?

1811
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:01,792
Which one do you
want to know about, Marty?

1812
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,253
The dad who made...
who helped you make...

1813
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,922
Shh.
That's not...

1814
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,549
MARTY:
Are they two separate guys?

1815
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,134
Yeah, Jack's dad, we met...

1816
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:12,887
I was cocktail waitressing
at a bar in college

1817
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:15,014
and he moved to...

1818
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:17,266
(sighs)

1819
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:20,394
Atlanta, I think.
Yeah.

1820
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:23,189
And, well, Molly's dad...

1821
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:27,068
I don't even know
where to start.

1822
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:29,820
- You don't have to...
- Look...

1823
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,990
this wasn't the plan.

1824
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,954
I know you guys moved off
and became really successful.

1825
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,416
And you're staring at me...
looking at me like...

1826
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,211
But...

1827
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,382
I mean, I...

1828
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:53,386
those pictures of me
in high school.

1829
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,846
I... and, no.

1830
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,976
It's what you said,
about that glow.

1831
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,523
(Sobs) I had it.

1832
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,151
And I miss it.

1833
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,073
And I just thought
for like, one night,

1834
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,951
I could give it a fucking...

1835
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,703
And then you guys come
and you ruin it.

1836
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,247
You completely fucked it up.

1837
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,043
(Chair rumbles)

1838
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:35,386
I have a single bed.

1839
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,557
I just have a little single bed.
A tiny little bed.

1840
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:44,145
I have a 200-square-foot apartment
because New York is so expensive,

1841
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:45,730
I can't afford anything more.

1842
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:47,398
I don't even have a separate room
for my toilet.

1843
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:49,316
It's just all in one room.

1844
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:52,361
And I wanted to get a double bed,
but then I wouldn't have had room

1845
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,905
for a partition around the toilet.
It would have just been

1846
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,574
a bed and a toilet,

1847
01:23:56,741 --> 01:24:00,286
and then the living room
and the kitchen is all the same,

1848
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,955
so I'd literally be shitting
where I eat.

1849
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,916
So, you know?

1850
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,169
(stammers) I...

1851
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:09,587
AJ:
My wife's leaving me.

1852
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:12,256
ANNA: - What?
- What?

1853
01:24:12,423 --> 01:24:13,758
Mm.

1854
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:16,427
MARTY:
Are you serious?

1855
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:19,430
Yeah, I keep screwing up
and she's getting sick of it.

1856
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:21,432
Or she keeps screwing up
and I'm getting sick of it.

1857
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:25,561
- It's...
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1858
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,732
There hasn't been a right time.

1859
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:32,526
What do you mean, the right time?
Are you kidding?

1860
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:34,278
I was best man at your wedding.

1861
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:36,572
Who else are you
gonna talk to about it?

1862
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:40,659
No one. No one.
No, I'm saying we all have messes.

1863
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,495
It's...

1864
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,455
We all have messes.

1865
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:49,502
I have a tiny bed,
you guys have... it's all relative.

1866
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,130
(Door opens)
- Oh.

1867
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:59,637
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, big guy.

1868
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,764
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

1869
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:02,973
I'm hungry.

1870
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,975
Okay, sweetheart.

1871
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:07,394
- Let me see what...
- You're hungry? I'm also hungry.

1872
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,065
Oh, this is... I'm the mayor of
Hungrytown right now.

1873
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,692
AJ: We're a bunch of
hungry, hungry hippos.

1874
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,362
Hungry hippos here.
So we're with you.

1875
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,823
AJ:
We're totally with you, big man.

1876
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:21,200
Big night.

1877
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,368
Big night for Jules.

1878
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:23,911
- I need French fries.
- Yeah, you do.

1879
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:26,080
- Like, now.
- All kinds of French fries.

1880
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:28,207
We need to go eat.
I'm starving.

1881
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:30,876
WOMAN:
Is anything open?

1882
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,045
- Night, guys.
- Night, Sam.

1883
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,931
Hey.
Let's go.

1884
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:46,809
Wake up.

1885
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:51,689
Hey.
You Okay?

1886
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,400
No.

1887
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,115
Let's go.

1888
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:06,036
Come on.
You gotta stand up.

1889
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,706
- Can you stand up?
- No.

1890
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,877
Come here, come here.

1891
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,761
SAM: Think you're gonna
remember this tomorrow?

1892
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,181
Nope.

1893
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,933
Okay. Let's get you
cleaned up, then.

1894
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,655
(Music plays)

1895
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,249
ELISE: - Another parking lot.
REEVES: - Yeah.

1896
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,503
Another parking lot.

1897
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:00,466
So, hey.
Where do you live?

1898
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:03,052
'Cause I don't think I know
where you actually live.

1899
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,095
I don't really live anywhere.

1900
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,473
I live out of a suitcase.

1901
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,520
Do you come back here often?

1902
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:16,941
No.
Almost never.

1903
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,947
Well, I'll just give you
my number.

1904
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,074
In case.

1905
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,244
In case you ever do come back.

1906
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,123
You could call me,
if you felt like it.

1907
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,301
And doing that
would be a bad idea.

1908
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:48,681
Why?

1909
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,061

You're always on the road.

01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,809
Don't be scared.

1982
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,394
You hear me?
Do not be scared.

1983
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:08,065
You are going to be
just like your dad.

1984

I just needed to, like...

2007
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,351
I needed to see

2014
01:33:48,582 --> 01:33:52,169
You're thinking
you want some bacon.

2015
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,299
I'm always thinking of bacon,

You will get everybody.
Just put it back.

It's just perfect.
I set it up perfectly.

Hey, Vanillo. Just hanging out
at your reunion. Hi.

2048
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:24,154
- What are you doing with this?
NICK: - I don't know.

2049
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:25,447
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

2050
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:27,115
You gotta be filming for a reason.

2051
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,534
- What's this for?
NICK: - I don't know.

2052
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,411
It's just for us, realty.
Nobody's gonna see it.

2053
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:32,954
Who's us?
I don't know who us is.

2054
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,122
So are you having
a good time here?

Yeah, are you having...
who are you?

2056
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,752
- I'm Vanillo. Nick.
- Oh.

2057
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,713
Hi, Vanillo.
How's it going?

2058
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,298
It's good to see you again.

2059
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:44,466
NICK:
It's good to see you, buddy.

2060
01:36:44,633 --> 01:36:46,176
- Remember Peter Chang?
- That's really bright.

2061
01:36:46,343 --> 01:36:48,261
- Yeah, I do.
- Jung. It's Peter Jung.

2062
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:49,429
- It's Jung.
- I know,

2063
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:51,056
but no one remembers
you by that.

2064
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:53,391
- Peter Jung, remember?
NICK: - Yeah, yeah.

2065
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,227
- I'm putting him in a car.
- Yeah.

2066
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:56,561
CULLY:
The night is young.

2067
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,314
NICK: Would you say
the night is Peter Jung?

2068
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:00,816

2069
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,820
Oh, my God. I spilled.

2070
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,364
The night is Peter Jung.

2071
01:37:07,531 --> 01:37:09,241
You know, the night is Chang.

2072
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,493
It's good to be back, see everybody.

2073
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,869
See Anna.

2074
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:14,079
Whoo. What?

2075
01:37:14,246 --> 01:37:15,831
Does your mom have big boobs?

2076
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:16,998
Whoo, she looks so good.

2077
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:19,626
She looks really... she almost looks
better than she did in high school.

2078
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:23,672
She's got a little bit
of late twenties heft.

2079
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:26,132
Like her body's yearning
to have a baby.

2080
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,760
It's funny seeing Scotty P.

2081
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:29,970
What is this, smashing?

2082
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,514
- Uh...
- What... what was smashing?

2083
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,724
NICK: Yeah, Scott.
What is smashing?

2084
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:36,518
Really, Nick? Really?

2085
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,937
You know, Kev Garrity...

2086
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:40,313
you know, G-Money?

2087
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,234
We're just smashing
every minute we can get.

2088
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:47,195
And then, hopefully,
out of the smash session,

2089
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:50,907
a baby will just smash out of

2090
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:54,119
him and me and then I'll smash
that baby out of the womb.

2091
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:55,429
And then my baby
will learn how to smash.

2092
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:56,496
NICK:
That's good.

2093
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:58,582
It's crazy, man.
It's crazy seeing everybody.

All the chicks we used to run.
What?

2096
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:03,600
- We should go in the stall.
- Don't tell Jake.

2097
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,005
- Let's go in the stall.
- Don't tell Jake.

2098
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,718
- Everybody in the stall.
NICK: - Yeah, everybody in the stall.

2099
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:12,387
SAM: - That's amazing.
- Actually, it's totally changed my...

2100
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,556
I actually never did this
in high school, ever.

2101
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,725
- So this is kind of, like...
(toilet flushes)

2102
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:19,686
- Oh!
(yelling, laughing)

2103
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:21,077
- I'm Millie... I'm Millie.
- You remixed...

2104
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:22,188
- Yeah.
- You remixed my song?

2105
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:24,482
You know, I mean?
I just do music on the side.

2106
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,027
- Which songs did you?
- ♪ The best I never had... ♪

2107

2108

But look how sexy this is.

kinda grabbed mine in the bathroom.

Look, I remember you
in tenth grade.

2117
01:38:49,925 --> 01:38:53,678
- Those roses looked like, flat.
- That was junior year.

2118
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,264
And then, in junior and senior year,

2119
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:57,933
those roses
looked like blossoms.

2120
01:38:58,099 --> 01:38:59,434
Well, I was a late bloomer.

2121
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:02,020
They're still talking about my boobs.
I'm sorry.
