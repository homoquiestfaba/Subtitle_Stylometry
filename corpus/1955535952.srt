1
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,384
I believe you are sincere
and good at heart

2
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:24,086
If you do not attain happiness always
remember that you are on the right road

3
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:30,917
try not to leave it. Above
all, avoid falsehood

4
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:36,578
every kind of falsehood,
especially falseness to yourself

5
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,389
teach us something useful

6
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:42,273
Watch over your own deceitfulness and
look into it every hour, every minute

7
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:46,688
avoid being scornful, both
to others and to yourself

8
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,304
What seems bad to you
within yourself will grow

9
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,822
pure by the very fact
of you observing it

10
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,138
-this is ridicilous
-we're paying for this

11
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,498
you're a disgrace

12
00:00:57,538 --> 00:01:00,562
Avoid fear, though
fear is only the

13
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,862
consequence of every
sort of falsehood

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,999
Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love

15
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:15,586
Don't be frightened overmuch
even at your evil actions

16
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:23,338
I am sorry I can say nothing more
consoling to you, for love in

17
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:26,652
action is a harsh and dreadful thing
compared with love in dreams.

18
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,884
Love in dreams is greedy
for immediate action,

19
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,667
rapidly performed and
so everyone can see

20
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:36,900
Men will even give their lives if only
the ordeal does not last too long but

21
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:40,934
is soon over with all looking on
and applauding as if on a stage

22
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:47,525
But active love,
active love is labour

23
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:51,483
and fortitude

24
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,450
Dostoyevsky

25
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:00,868
so what was that all about?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,270
that's what we're here to discuss

27
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,629
but you never discuss anything,
you just ask questions

28
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:08,094
we've been stuck on the same
paragraph for a month and a half

29
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:15,034
it's an important paragraph

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,931
read it

31
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:29,506
i believe you are sincere
and good at heart

32
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,425
if you do not
attain happiness

33
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,183
always remember
you are on the righ road

34
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,948
try not to leave it

35
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:37,651
a bove all, avoid
falsehood, every kind of

36
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,591
falsehood, especially
falseness to yourself

37
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,166
watch over your own
deceitfulness and

38
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:45,690
look into it every
hour, every minute

39
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,107
by the very fact of
your observing it

40
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,478
-what do you make of that?
-it's good advice man

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,336
-is it?
-you tell me

42
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:09,325
i don't know

43
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,919
but you're the teacher

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,154
i teach literature,
i dont give advice

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,501
you're wasting our time

46
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:17,964
i'm asking you questions

47
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,900
we're supposed to
ask the questions

48
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:21,313
you're supposed to
give us the answers

49
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,938
perhaps its not as
important to know

50
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,877
the answers as it is to ask
the questions better

51
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,708
there you see he told us something

52
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,314
no he didnt he just asked
us another question

53
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:40,010
Never be frightened at your own
faint-heartedness in attaining love

54
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:43,198
Stop that!

55
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,784
what is father Zossima
trying to tell this woman?

56
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,935
I'm warning you man

57
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,677
is it possible to appreciate this advice
 if we aren't faithful?

58
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:54,999
tell me something! tell me something
 thats gonna help me pass the final exam

59
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:58,567
what do we mean when we use the word faith?

60
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:08,233
two coffees please

61
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,055
you can't beat up students beacause
they don't like Dostoyevsky

62
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,641
perhaps

63
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,679
-can you give a ride to town today?
-sure

64
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,053
are you okay?

65
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:24,483
Air's too cold, sun's too bright.
this coffee although i haven't had

66
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:28,562
any yet is undoubtedly too strong.
i wanna lie down and evaporate

67
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,015
you're having a crisis of faith

68
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,323
 -No i'm not
-Yes you are

69
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,582
Henry i'm an atheist

70
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,036
maybe you only think
you're an atheist

71
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:37,393
-i'm in pain
-all pain is desire

72
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,646
Is that criticism or advice?

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,362
i think its Buddhism

74
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:45,290
-Henry?
-yes?

75
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,871
-i'm in love
-no really?

76
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,962
yes i think so
how can you tell?

77
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:53,117
lack of concentration
erratic mood swings

78
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:54,916
faulty reasoning
obsessive behavior

79
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:59,281
its not like you to go running off
 after young women

80
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:02,193
i'm not running off after anyone
i'm falling towards her

81
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:05,290
-as if you cant help yourself?
-yea something like that

82
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:08,402
i see, i've read about this type of thing

83
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,526
and then there's this

84
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:19,431
love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing
compared with love in dreams

85
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,626
is this an active
love or a dream?

86
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:25,380
it's a dream about
to become reality

87
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,462
name the proofs of this reality

88
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,550
a thoughtful gesture,
delicate smile

89
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,101
white slender neck

90
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,177
an earnest inquisitive and alluring voice

91
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:42,587
greacful figure, intelligent sensuous eyes

92
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:46,527
-describe the nature of the dream
-intimacy

93
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,894
name the constituent elements of intimacy

94
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,839
kissing, caressing, holding

95
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:59,184
slapping, shouting, talking

96
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,415
waiting, sleeping, crying

97
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,481
listening, hoping, incouraging

98
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:13,541
forgiving, laughing, volanting

99
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,295
in a word: verbs

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,049
and therefore active

101
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,873
oh i feel much better now

102
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:33,765
 waitress are settling much prettier
 than i first came in

103
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,057
ambient shadows less irritating

104
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:39,659
daylight is not threatening me anymore
 it's just there

105
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,679
filling the street for
no apparent reason

106
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:46,290
a mistake perhaps but in
any event i'm not afraid

107
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,697
-glad to hear it
-check please

108
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,386
how do you proceed?

109
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,799
to live just move forward
towards those you love

110
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:57,602
-intriguing theory
-no an impeccable truth

111
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,767
but knowledge wont
help where you're going

112
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:00,455
what will?

113
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,672
-faith
-you mean love

114
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,109
no faith

115
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,651
whats the distinction between
 faith and love?

116
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,181
love without faith is merely a infatuation

117
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:11,211
infatutaion

118
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:14,102
such a beautiful word

119
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,853
my friend you're doomed

120
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,143
perhaps, so why do you
need to go into town?

121
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,546
-i've been thrown out of school
-No

122
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,062
well what are you going to do?

123
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,317
i dont know maybe i'll get a job

124
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,606
-well if there's anything you need just ask
-thanks

125
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:33,556
-so i'll see in the parking lot at 4
-okay

126
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,325
well here goes

127
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:39,793
desperate, his
frustration spills

128
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,789
no bursts forth

129
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,659
thats better

130
00:07:43,903 --> 00:07:49,403
his frustration bursts
forth into audacity

131
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:54,927
he says as fast as he can

132
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:57,751
whatever he feels

133
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:01,774
he says as fast as he
can whatever he feels

134
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:06,762
he feels hurt and speaks pain

135
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,433
i like that very
direct, passionate

136
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:12,496
he feels

137
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,657
he concludes

138
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:16,450
he likes you

139
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,162
-who?
-your literature professor

140
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,750
oh yes i know

141
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,374
you shouldnt get mixed
up with him people will

142
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,273
think you sleep with him
to get a better grade

143
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:27,461
people are disapointing

144
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,105
let me intruduce you to Mark

145
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,113
i dont want to get involved
with anyone right now

146
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,526
why not?
because i'm busy

147
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,750
i have a lot to study and i'm
enjoying it, working hard

148
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:36,761
but Mark is so good
looking and he likes you

149
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:40,608
-he fascinates me a little
-Mark?

150
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:41,673
No my teacher

151
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:42,816
Really?

152
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:45,536
there's something sort of tragic
about him don't you think?

153
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,514
he's name is Jude like in <i>Jude The Obscure</i>

154
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:50,858
-he looks half mad
-he's in love

155
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:52,092
Men are pathetic

156
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:53,317
i think he's kind of charming

157
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,141
in a way

158
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,316
i write about him

159
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:02,869
what do you write about?

160
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:07,455
different things,
speculate, study him

161
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:13,577
i'm going to write a short story with
him at the center or some one like him

162
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,126
<i>Him</i> that's what i call it
<i>Him</i>

163
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:24,639
-i'm doing laundry tonight

bottle of detergent?

to love and to cherish

175
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,608

00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:23,158
to love and to cherish

181
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:28,925
hey you marry me
come on

182
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,840
somebody need any help?

183
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,902
somebody need any assistance?

184
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,356
can i help some one?

185
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:42,450
somebody need any help?

186
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,231
can i help some one?

187
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:05,440
my manager says you either
gotta buy a book or leave

188
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,237
listen to this

189
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,144
ignorance is the necessary
condition of  human happiness

190
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:18,640
we're almost entirely
ignorant of ourselves

191
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:21,813
absolutely of others in
ignorance we find our bliss

192
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:24,391
in illusions our happiness

193
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,691
i write down all those
questions you ask in class

194
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,344
 you do?

195
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:47,347
i take them home and re-read the
chapters you've assigned, it helps

196
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:50,378
- what does?
- asking the questions

197
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:51,430
how?

198
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:56,831
submitting all i read in the book
to that ongoing list of questions

199
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:59,174
somehow it shows

200
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:02,396
it shows how consistent
his concerns were

201
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,395
Dostoevsky

202
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,007
it does huh?

203
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:09,605
before i began asking
those questions over

204
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,218
and over again of the text
i was having a hard time

205
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,942
i couldn't see what he was getting at
i kept hoping he get back to the story

206
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:17,462
and then what happened?

207
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:22,643
the questions focused my concentration
i'm getting more out of my reading now

208
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,644
does anybody work here?

209
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:30,320
i can't say i intended to teach you
anything but i'm glad it helps

210
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:33,496
but they're your
questions you asked them first

211
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,499
i asked them for
different reasons

212
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,677
what reasons?

213
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:48,256
the book seems alive

214
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,592
you seem alive

215
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:53,371
that book there seems alive too

216
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:56,637
things you're reading are
having an effect on you

217
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,340
me? i read

218
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:00,716
i understand, i appreciate

219
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:04,289
but still i'm left unchanged

220
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,039
i can't put into actions
what it is i understand

221
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:11,396
shouldn't knowledge
provide solace?

222
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:12,849
i don't know

223
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,597
perhaps i don't
understand anything

224
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,624
do you have anywhere to go?

225
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:21,815
you've been in here for hours

226
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,287
when do you get off work?

227
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,131
8 o'clock

228
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:31,430
can i drive you back to campus?

229
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,290
no thanks i take the bus

230
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:36,850
will you have a drink with
me before you take the bus?

231
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:41,265
okay but only if you leave now my
manager will yell at me if you don't

232
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:42,885
okay the bar on the corner?

233
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,702
do you wanna buy the book?

234
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,486
nah books don't help

235
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,304
to love and to cherish

236
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:58,873
what's that?

237
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,366
it's coffee and a muffin

238
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,507
what's this suppose to mean?

239
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,288
it's not suppose to mean anything

240
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:11,491
you can't get something for
nothing you know mister

241
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,629
no not usually i suppose

242
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:16,306
just because a guy buys
a girl a cup of coffee

243
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:19,153
doesn't mean she has to
jump into the sack with him

244
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,295
look i'm putting it over here

245
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,265
why buy the cow when you
can get the milk for free?

246
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:26,804
what?

247
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,828
that's the truth
about things mister

248
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,935
look it's right here see?

249
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,462
coffee and a muffin okay?

250
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:40,294

her charming combination

bye

280
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,053
do you like your job?

281
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,569
it's okay i get a discount
on my books it helps

282
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,541
do you like yours?

283
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,757
not really i'm bad at it

284
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:45,883
are you bad at it because
you don't like it or

285
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:47,829
do you not like it
because you're bad at it?

286
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:50,961
do you think i'm a bad teacher?

287
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,383
i have learn things in your class

288
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,714
you're a better student
than i am a teacher

289
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:58,981
that's because you give me
more attention than the others

290
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,064
that's true

291
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,589
does that bother you?

292
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,130
no

293
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,942
to tell you the truth

294
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,162
when i feel i'm teaching well

295
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:17,146
when i'm making myself clear

296
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,192
when i'm actually incouraging a
student to think specifically

297
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:24,888
and articulate
more appropriately

298
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:27,166
when i feel this

299
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:30,700
i'm usually thinking of you

300
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,802
does that embarrass you?

301
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,098
a little

302
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,460
when i'm reading that really
excites me for instance

303
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:40,185
i want desperately to
share it with some one

304
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,643
it's you i wanna share it with

305
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,701
why me?

306
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,616
it's complicated

307
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:49,113
no it's not

308
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,264
it's not?

309
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,479
it's because you
think i'm pretty

310
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:53,823
perhaps

311
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:59,629
i'm sorry it doesn't change
the fact that i care for you

312
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,694
you hardly know me

313
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:06,463
that's true i hardly know anyone but i
know how i feel even if i don't know why

314
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,160
would you like me to tell
you something about myself?

315
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,672
if you want to

316
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,143
i appreciate being taken seriously
but i'm always concerned

317
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:16,478
that i'm not
sufficiently serious

318
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:20,977
i know men look at me and think
i'm alright but i think it's

319
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:24,757
contemptuous to utilize that
fact in order to achieve something

320
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:29,994
but if had to i'm afraid i might

321
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,728
and that bothers me

322
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:37,141
i'm very curious and i'm
afraid of seeming gullible

323
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,807
so i'm argumentative more
than i think i should be

324
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:44,565
what did you lie to your roommate
you were out with some one else?

325
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:51,547
if people knew we were out
together they would say

326
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:53,770
i was sleeping with you in
order to get a better grade

327
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:55,476
- but we're not
- not what

328
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,049

- you the one

00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,298
- did he ask you out?
- yes

337
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,894
- but i said i was busy

00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:54,775
i wish i had legs like hers

340
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,029

342
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:03,903

00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,504
it's what you always say

361
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,733
- is it?
- yes perhaps

362
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,411
when do i say that?

363
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,280
well for instance whenever you don't
want to admit that you're wrong

364
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,596
you always look away
and say perhaps

365
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,092
- no i don't
- yes you do

366
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,456
i always admit when i'm wrong

367
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:27,513
that's not true

368
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,075
yes it is i cherish my flaws

369
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,286
ah you see that's another
thing you always do

370
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:32,433
what is?

371
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,366
whenever you're losing an argument

372
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,346
you always depict yourself
as hopelessly incompetent

373
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:39,701
as if humbly admiting
your shortcomings

374
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:42,496
somehow places you above
the argumentative hand

375
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,120
there for negating the other
person's point of view entirely

376
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:49,909
you're pretty thorough

377
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:51,024
honestly observent

378
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:53,827
- i'm pretty flattered
- i'll make a note of that

379
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,316
you haven't answer my question

380
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,686
what question is that?

381
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,715
- can i see you tonight?
- perhaps

382
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:04,762
i've gotta go call me

383
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,277
- Henry
- oh hi Jude

384
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:10,359
what are you doing here?

385
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:11,457
i work here now

386
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,230
- no kidding
- yea

387
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:14,609
great job, all these books

388
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,683
boss doesn't like
me too much but

389
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,233
i always had a problem
with authority

390
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,393
what are you doing here?

391
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:20,592
oh i came to see Sophie

392
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,652
ahh Sophie

393
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,877
Sophia that's greek you
know it's means to know

394
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:29,248
i'll keep that in mind

395
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,251
but she's got a boyfriend

396
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,011
- no she doesn't
- sure she does

397
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:36,088
lots of 'em, they're in here everyday
she flirts with them constantly

398
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:38,652
no she would've told me if she
were involved with some one

399
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,824
- why?
- why what?

400
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,639
why would she have told you?

401
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:45,245
because she would have wanted me
to know we are close you know

402
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,227
- how close?
- close

403
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,667
- do you sleep together?
- no not yet

404
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:51,820
so you're just friends

405
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,621
we're a little bit
more than friends

406
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:55,184
Jude you're deluding yourself

407
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:56,980
you don't know anything about it

408
00:23:57,011 --> 00:24:01,991
a man'll throw all his heart won wisdom
toss away years of aquired knowledge

409
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:04,648
all for what? a pretty face

410
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:09,558
well what is all your
deligent cynicism and

411
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,538
years of intellectual
inquiry gotten you huh?

412
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:14,526
a job in a bookstore

413
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,871
- piece of mind
- what?

414
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:19,777
or atleast something
approximating piece of mind

415
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:23,906
you don't live in the real
world henry you live in books

416
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:26,957
and ideas you're a victim
of theoretical abstraction

417
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,160
hey i struggle with my
demons as much as you

418
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,160
 but are they
really demons?

419
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,086
all distractions are demons

420
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,136
you know my biggest fear is this

421
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,854
that all my hard work
all my good intentions

422
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,979
all my studying have
been nothing more than

423
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:49,294
bulding of a wall
between me and life

424
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,979
- extacly
- what?

425
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,839
you must withdraw from life

426
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:56,167
don't be stupid i wanna embrace life

427
00:24:56,683 --> 00:25:00,027
to know about life sometimes
you have step away from it

428
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,840
oh yeah? listen to this

429
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:06,732
''yet, every now and then, there would pass
a young girl, slender, fair and desirable

430
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:11,561
arousing in young men a not ignoble
desire to possess her, and stirring

431
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:15,820
in old men regrets for ecstasy
not seized and now forever past''

432
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:06,269
he is quiet
yet opinionated

433
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:10,356
powerful but shy

434
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,620
i need new clothes

435
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:17,090
thoughtful and impetuous

436
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,894
- i hate this video
- i like this song

437
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:21,606
the lead singer is hot

438
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,777
he looks mean and insensitive

439
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,839
do you think i should
make my hair blonde?

440
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,215
not untill summer

441
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:34,061
i wanna lose weight

442
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,262
is Marguerite Duras a lesbian?

443
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:38,253
god i hope Mike calls me back

444
00:27:38,378 --> 00:27:44,425
he is solemn despite himself

445
00:27:45,003 --> 00:27:49,674
reckless and hell bent

446
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,503
freightened of his own carelessness

447
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,441
that's a pradox

448
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,175
- hello?
- get outta here

449
00:28:04,878 --> 00:28:06,485

450
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,316
how are you?

451
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,228
Jude?

452
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:14,258
i'm a wreck

453
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,275
excuse me?

454
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,429
i'm excited too excited to sleep

455
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,025
- where are you?
- on a street

456
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:22,145
in town?

457
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,196
i've been walking for hours

458
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,487
i had to walk, think i'm
gonna walk all night

459
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,457
why don't you come out
and walk with me?

460
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,729
what's come over you?

461
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:31,621
i can't get you out of my head

462
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:35,878
i'll drive up to campus and pick
you up we stay out all night

463
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,550
- i can't
- why not?

464
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:44,269
i've got classes tomorrow
i've gotta study

465
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:46,082
so what! i wrote a poem for you

466
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,640
a poem?

467
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:49,888
- yea
- really?

468
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,890
yea i was at a bar

469
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:56,188
i was possessed, inspired beyond
belief i grabbed a napkin

470
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,212
scrolled it out in one
huge burst of creativity

471
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,443
beautiful poem really beautiful

472
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,519
and then i spilled my bear on it and
now i don't remember how it went

473
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:10,269
meet me at the cafe in an hour

474
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,507
- Henry
- Jude

475
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:23,672
ive decided i'm joing
the priesthood

476
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:25,849
you always say that when
you've had too much to drink

477
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:27,088
yeah this time i mean it

478
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,351
what about your job
at the bookstore?

479
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,456
i got fired

480
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:35,291
jesus Henry monastery is
probably just the place for you

481
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,472
think so?

482
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,514
you are socially retarded

483
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,023
i march to the beat
of a different drum

484
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,077
you got any money?

485
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:44,172
i don't need money
i got conviction

486
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,720
well here this will help
sustain your conviction

487
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:52,742
you know Jude that's your problem
you don't believe in anything

488
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,000
that's a problem?

489
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:55,215
ofcourse it is

490
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,738
it seems to me the people who
believe in things are the problem

491
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,126
how do you mean?

492
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:06,077
people who bomb embassies usually
insist that they believe in things

493
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:10,294
rival terrorist organizations machine gun
women and children in the supermarkets

494
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,362
because they believe in things

495
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:15,096
elected officials shut down
hospitals and then vote for

496
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,822
increases in the defence budget
usually because believe in things

497
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,360
no i rather not
believe in things

498
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,329
but what's the alternative?

499
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,328
man can't live without faith

500
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:29,756
he can live without faith he can't
live without understanding

501
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:31,070
faith comes after
understanding

502
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,668
and how do you suppose
one gains understanding?

503
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,067
through exprience

504
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:38,618
ah you wanna achieve spiritual
end through materialist means

505
00:30:38,742 --> 00:30:39,838
that's your problem

506
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:41,434
Henry leave me
alone you're drunk

507
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,003
you won't listen to reason

508
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,567
no i won't listen to
reason not tonight

509
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,439
- but you must
- don't try and stop me Henry

510
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,932
you'll never survive this

511
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,189
how do you know?

512
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,564
besides i don't
know if i want to

513
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:18,074
are you okay?

514
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,628
i don't know maybe i'll
never be the same again

515
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:22,224
but who cares?

516
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,248
kiss me

517
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:39,245
why did you tell your roommate
it was your mother on the phone?

518
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:43,189
- i told you why
- but it's different now

519
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,404
how is it different?

520
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:47,651
it's understood that you're not
here in order to get a better grade

521
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:53,932
isn't?

522
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,315
well yes it is

523
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,549
between us

524
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,468
no one else matters

525
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:13,679
i'm embarrassed

526
00:32:13,704 --> 00:32:14,733
of me?

527
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,956
i don't want to seem like somebody i'm not

528
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:19,230
to who?

529
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,211
to myself

530
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:32,385
you should go

531
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,852
i don't want to

532
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:36,513
you don't know why you're here

533
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,444
people often do things
they don't understand

534
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:40,381
it doesn't make
them less genuine

535
00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:46,307
maybe

536
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,404
do you want me to go?

537
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:54,360
no

538
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,086
are you sure?

539
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:57,131
yes

540
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,964
i'm going to undress

541
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:01,516
okay

542
00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:09,824
do you think i'm very beautiful?

543
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:11,013
yes

544
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:20,987
if you never see me
again after tonight

545
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,497
will you be sad?

546
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:27,504
don't worry about it

547
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:36,641
yes but you know

548
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:40,826
will you be tortured by the
memory of having been with me?

549
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,585
of having caressed me

550
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,222
will you wonder if
i'm with other men?

551
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:50,779
will you be jealous?

552
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:52,770
will you become obssessed?

553
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,198
will you carry your disappointment
around with you forever?

554
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:04,913
will you be maudlin
and anti-social?

555
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:08,988
will you get into fights?

556
00:34:09,785 --> 00:34:15,317
will you expect other women
to be somehow more like me?

557
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:18,386
my mouth my eyes

558
00:34:19,711 --> 00:34:22,241
the way i wear my hair

559
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:26,644
will you? will you be
like that you think?

560
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,163
perhaps

561
00:34:29,788 --> 00:34:31,881
it's the nature of
things you know

562
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,020
regret

563
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,253
i'll risk it

564
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,722
hey will you marry me?

565
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,404
please

566
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,290
why do you wanna marry me?

567
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:57,539
why not?

568
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,644
i can think a lot of reasons
if i weren't so drunk

569
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:02,356
why are you so drunk?

570
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:05,129
i don't know,
nights are too long

571
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,426
the nights are too long because you
have no one to share them with

572
00:35:10,254 --> 00:35:12,966
that's a very compassion
way of putting it

573
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,485
- marry me
- but i don't know you

574
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:18,909
what does that matter? does
anyone really know anyone else?

575
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,673
ah that's a good point

576
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:24,536
i'd go a step further and ask does
anybody really know themselves?

577
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:25,762
exactly

578
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:27,661
what's your name?

579
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:28,959
Katy

580
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:35,457
- glad to meet you Katy, Henry
- how are you Henry?

581
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,020
wasted

582
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:39,512
so what do you say
will you marry me?

583
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,278
well i doubt we can get married right
here in the middle of the night

584
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:45,216
- we could if we were in Reno

585
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,135

586
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,038

- you know what i mean

589
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,504
we don't have to
sleep on it together

590
00:36:05,002 --> 00:36:07,451
why? don't you think i'm beautiful?

591
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,129
Katy you're a goddess

592
00:36:10,157 --> 00:36:13,276

593
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,024
who died trying to marry me

594
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,330
i don't doubt it

595
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,014

engaged for the time being?

00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:29,527
what about a ring?
a ring?

601
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:32,295
a ring if we're gonna get engaged
you gotta give me a ring

602
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,286
oh ring here, it's my college ring

603
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,394

610
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:53,168

611
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:55,306
of theology. almost

612
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:57,409

you get out of school?

613
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:01,533
ooh i don't know i've been in school all
my life i don't know how to do anything

614
00:37:04,394 --> 00:37:05,879
well i hope you don't
expect me to go

615
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,722
and support you for the
rest of your life?

616
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:11,707
already with the nagging

617
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:16,652
what a torturous path
i've made for myself

618
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:18,265
shackling myself to you

619
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:34,021
oh Katy now don't get so upset

620
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:38,075
all newlyweds have these
little battles we'll survive

621
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:40,890
- you think so?
- absolutely

622
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:46,660
you're a good man Henry

623
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,832
Ah Kate come on let's go
home and get some sleep

624
00:37:50,864 --> 00:37:53,682
- okay i know a place
- good

625
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,169
his weaknesses

626
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:30,285
are enduring

627
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:34,055
his strengths

628
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,541
threathen to eclipse

629
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:44,851
my own self confidence

630
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,123
he eats out

631
00:40:00,788 --> 00:40:02,241
a lot

632
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,585
- hey aren't you?
- no

633
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:27,179
- yes you are
- no i'm not

634
00:40:27,242 --> 00:40:30,023
- but last night
- what about last night?

635
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:31,921
you were with him

636
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,344
no i wasn't

637
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:36,976
i'm sorry perhaps i'm mistaking

638
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,094
perhaps

639
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:42,851
i just saw your girlfriend

640
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:43,944
 Sophia

641
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:47,242
she claims not to know you

642
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:49,648
- no
- yes

643
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:50,976
NO

644
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,296
afraid so

645
00:41:04,054 --> 00:41:06,367
i don't understand

646
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,697
there's nothing to
understand we're animals

647
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:13,663
"Eros is a bad and fickle little godhead"

648
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,422
does this thing still work?

649
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:18,365
i hate when she does that

650
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:20,818
today's the first day of spring

651
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,822
that's no consultation

652
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:26,759
boy i must've been hammered
last night i woke up in a strange apartment

653
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,103
somehow i managed to
lose my college ring

654
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:31,110
eat your toast and get out

655
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:35,289
- no love is free
- what?

656
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:36,544
freud said that

657
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:38,125
don't start with me Henry

658
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,341
heard a fascinating statement
in a movie last night

659
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:43,020
you don't seem to be aware
of the pain i'm expriencing

660
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,167
- excuse me?
- forget it

661
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:46,906
- it's biblical
- what is?

662
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:50,063
the statement, "love
does not discriminate"

663
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:51,689
i don't follow

664
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:57,215
and the people asked him saying:

665
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,382
"what shall we do then"

666
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:00,820
- that's Luke
- chapter 3 verse 10

667
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,758
- so?
- "so the apostle replies

668
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:08,079
love and cherish unquestioningly
whoever happens to be before you

669
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,991
Love does not discriminate"

670
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:14,835
I'm no apostle, Henry

671
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,523
Take it easy, it was just
something I heard in a movie

672
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:21,618
Listen pal, you can't
waltz in here, use my toaster

673
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:25,109
and start spouting universal
truths without qualification!

674
00:42:25,195 --> 00:42:27,326
what's that?

675
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:28,951
what?

676
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,367
you smell that?

677
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:34,757
oh yeah

678
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:37,684
she's left her fragrance here

679
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,539
that's it. Get out!

680
00:42:39,564 --> 00:42:41,626
- what about my toast?
- Get out!

681
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:17,087
- Scram
- what?

682
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:26,730
why did you do that?

683
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,601
i'm upset i guess

684
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:30,093
idiot

685
00:43:30,918 --> 00:43:32,909
why do you deny me?

686
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:38,215
i don't wanna get involved
with anyone right now

687
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,486
 i'm busy

688
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:44,484
studying working hard

689
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,374
and i like it

690
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:52,311
why do you need what's
between us to be seen?

691
00:43:52,336 --> 00:43:53,381
i don't

692
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:55,937
i need it to be acknowledged

693
00:43:56,624 --> 00:43:58,599
this is embarrassing

694
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,906
what are you writing?

695
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,265
it's part of a story

696
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,094
can i hear it?

697
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,455
no

698
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:21,031
read it

699
00:44:25,547 --> 00:44:27,299
read it

700
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:46,825
he is desperate and his
frustration mounts to overflowing

701
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,461
before giving way to his
final and audacious mistake

702
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,671
finaly he caves in
gives up

703
00:44:55,696 --> 00:45:01,555
and takes what is offered because he
knows he can because he knows he wants

704
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,196
he lacks faith and
therefore patience

705
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:10,759
the giving of himself has left him
empty and old before his time

706
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,688
that's very interesting

707
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:25,508
but i think it should be a woman

708
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:30,784
what do you think?

709
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,015
go on read it as a woman

710
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:51,653
she is desperate and her
frustration mounts to overflowing

711
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:54,723
before giving way to her
final and audacious mistake

712
00:45:56,848 --> 00:46:02,781
finaly she caves in, gives up
and takes what is offered

713
00:46:03,906 --> 00:46:09,419
because she knows she can
because she knows she wants

714
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,687
she lacks faith and
therefore patience

715
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:20,056
the giving of herself has left her
empty and old before her time

716
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,512
just don't

717
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,374
damn

718
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:27,275

734
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:52,920
i just wanted somebody to ask

735
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:21,889
Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky

736
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:27,674
born in moscow 1821

737
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:30,643
his father was a

738
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,593
drunken brute of an army Surgeon
who treated his sowers horribly

739
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:39,371
so he... they murdered him by pouring vodka
down his throat till he gagged

740
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:43,913
Fyodor had some success
with his first novel but

741
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:46,710
then he was arrested for
subversion against Tsar

742
00:49:48,296 --> 00:49:52,671
after 8 months in
solitary confinement

743
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,951
he was led before a firing squad

744
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:01,246
he stood there in a death shroud

745
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:05,226
facing an open and hastily dug
grave awaiting his execution

746
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:08,945
then some one decided he
didn't need to be shot

747
00:50:11,686 --> 00:50:16,232
so for the next 4 or 5 years he did hard
labour in some cold siberian prison

748
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:21,530
it was there in siberia that he
began to suffer from epilepsy

749
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:38,076
finally 10 years after being
dragged away in chains

750
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:41,292
he returned to Saint Petersburg

751
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:47,576
he converted to a conservative and
profoundly religious philosophy

752
00:50:47,905 --> 00:50:50,422
nevertheless he was
utterly destitute

753
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,063
an alcoholic and a
compulsive gambler

754
00:50:53,702 --> 00:50:55,661
he married Anna Dostoyevskaya

755
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,400
and wrote atleast 4 of the
greatest novels in history

756
00:51:25,093 --> 00:51:27,780
