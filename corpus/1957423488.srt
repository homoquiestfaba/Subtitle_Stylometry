00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,674
Can you see it?

5
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:15,329
[Chris] Uh, yeah, a little,
but it looks good.

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,898
All right,
can you slate for me?Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:22,075
All right,
whenever you'’re ready.

8
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,773
Mmm, okay.

9
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:29,996
Uh, we are here
in the beautiful Denny'’s
in Scottsdale, Arizona,

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,957
and I am about to meet my first
biological relative, Samuel.

11
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,003
Samuel.Samuel.

12
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:40,136
You gonna tell them about
all the drunken nights
here at this booth?

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,792
You do not--
You keep your mouth shut.Grand Slam.

14
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,185
I think that'’s him.

15
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:48,362
[Chris]
You think that'’s him?Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:54,890
[Chris] Yeah, he'’s trying to
pay the Uber with cash.
That'’s definitely him.

17
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,724
Samuel?Yeah, it'’s me.

18
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:03,943
Margot.

19
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:06,206
Cool.
[chuckles][laughs]

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,685
Wow.Wow.

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,646
Oh, this is crazy.
Sorry.No, no, I'’m...

22
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:14,692
uh, at a loss for words
myself.

23
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,867
[chuckles]

24
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,609
Are you hungry?Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:21,482
Is that...

26
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:24,180
Yeah, it'’s Chris.[Chris]
Hey. How you doing?

27
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:28,228
[Samuel] So, you said that
this is gonna be a documentary?

28
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:32,928
Yeah. It'’s weird.
I never thought I would ever
do anything about myself.

29
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:35,757
Feels kind of
self-indulgent,

30
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:39,108
but Chris
pushed me to do it.

31
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,023
[Chris]
Her story'’s too good.

32
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:43,852
Some waters for you.Thank you.

33
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,247
Thank you.

34
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:51,642
I'’ve actually, uh,
never, uh, been...

35
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:55,646
in front of a camera before.

36
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,519
Any camera?

37
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,782
Yeah.What?

38
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:05,526
Yeah, we'’re typically not
supposed to be, um...
photographed,

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,442
'’cause, you know,
uh, vanity is a sin.

40
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:10,052
Ah. Right, right.

41
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:13,490
But there are exceptions,
if our elders condone it.

42
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,450
Yeah, you had said
on the phone that
you left the community.

43
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:17,538
Right?Yeah.

44
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:19,757
And how long ago
has it been?

45
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,151
About...

46
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:26,329
seven months, I think.

47
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:28,636
Is this weird
for your adopted parents?

48
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,509
It is, but could I
have gone on living
the rest of my life

49
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,946
not finding out
who my real family was?

50
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,123
Yeah, it'’d be fine,

51
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:43,694
but I think for a lot
of us people who have been
given up by their parents,

52
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,435
there'’s always
something missing.

53
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:53,443
Anyway, to find out
where I come from would be
really special for me.

54
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:55,141
Absolutely.

55
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:56,707
Hopefully I can help.

56
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,711
How do you even meet
an Amish dude on 23andMe?

57
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:03,497
Isn'’t that
against the rules?He'’s on his Rumspringa.

58
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,586
What'’s that?It'’s basically like a year

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,067
where they get to
see the outside world
for themselves.

60
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:11,157
So he was
floating around, you know,
taking odd jobs.

61
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:14,595
Then he meets this woman
and builds her a pen--

62
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:15,770
[Chris]
Chicken coop.

63
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:17,859
Thank you. Chicken coop.
Correct.

64
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:21,471
Basically, she becomes
obsessed with him.More of a cat-lady type, yeah.

65
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,560
Do you wanna
tell the story?

66
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,954
[Chris] My bad, my bad.
I'’m sorry.'’Cause you can if you want.

67
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,477
[laughs]

68
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:29,740
Anyway, so basically
she'’s bragging to him

69
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:32,787
about how she'’s 25% Cherokee
or whatever

70
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,311
and tells him about
the online DNA test you can do.

71
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:39,141
So he gets one,
gets a match-- it'’s me.

72
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,317
She'’s Amish.[giggles]

73
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,537
I am not Amish.You are Amish.

74
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:44,712
Not how that works.

75
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,237
[Jeremy]
You got this from the hospital?

76
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:53,112
I can'’t believe
anyone would just abandon
their baby like that.

77
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,289
This must have been
so intense for you.

78
00:03:56,463 --> 00:04:01,294
Yeah, I'’ve probably
watched that video
over a hundred times,

79
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:03,644
and I get a new question
every time I watch it.

80
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,429
Like, why did she do it?

81
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:11,086
Why did she drive
so far away
just to abandon me?

82
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,396
Is she even still alive?
You know.

83
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,920
[people chattering, faint]

84
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:22,358
What I think is weird
about it is the way
that she'’s holding me.

85
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,796
Like, looking around
like she'’s scared.

86
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:30,888
Maybe she was just worried
she was gonna get caught.

87
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,370
Guilt, yeah?[Chris] Yeah, I mean,
that'’s what I think.

88
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,067
Maybe.

89
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,591
I don'’t know.

90
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:41,856
[Chris chuckles]

Are you okay if we...Oh, yeah, yeah.

122

All good, baby.[engine starts]

00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,124
Really?Yeah.

125
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,909
I mean, it was diagnosed once,
but I think I kept
getting it after that.

126
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,043
Yeah, I don'’t know.
My body is weird, but I'’m alive.

Seriously, thank you so much
for getting us there.

00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:27,135
Yeah, of course.
I had nothing going on,
so this is great for me.

129
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,964
[Chris]
There'’s so much more snow
up here.

130
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:32,314
Oh, yeah.
Weather changes every day.

One day you got snow,
next it'’s slush.

That'’s why you gotta do
these zip off--

I do all my pants
with zip offs, so it'’s--

134
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,236
You got pants.
Oh, it'’s too hot out?

135
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,499
Now you got shorts, baby.

I'’ll throw the legs on, dude.
It rules.

easy access for the ladies,

So you didn'’t think
to call ahead and let them
know we were coming?

173
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:13,083
[Chris]
They'’re fucking Amish, dude.
They don'’t have a phone.

174
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,345
Oh.

175
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,086
Right.Yeah.

176
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,786
[groans]Two beds.

177
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,833
Okay, we'’re gonna
have to figure that out.

178
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:26,227
Goddamn.

179
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,534
You gotta teach me
how you do this.
Do you have a system?

180
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,886
Yeah, just make a list,
account for it, make sure
you put it in the right spot.

181
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,715
That blue one
actually goes right there
in that corner.

182
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,020
There you go.Awesome.

183
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:39,327
Yeah, you know,
it'’s pretty easy.

184
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,634
Man! GoPro.

185
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,766
These rule.
Love these.

186
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,769
You can get them filthy,
you can toss them around,
you can get them wet.

187
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:50,730
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you can do...

188
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:53,820
Yeah, you can do a lot
with the GoPros.
Yeah, you'’re right.

189
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,213
[man talking on TV, faint]

190
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,741
You missed it.

191
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:05,919
I mean, like,
maybe this is gonna be
a process. You know?

192
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:11,011
Maybe Sam can go back tomorrow
and try again.

193
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:13,709
I mean, he left '’em.

194
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,581
They probably don'’t
even want him back.Shh.

195
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,191
Stop.I'’m just saying.

196
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,846
Keep your voice down.We might have to
adopt him.

197
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,848
He'’s right there.
Can you chill?

198
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,898
We'’ll figure it out.

199
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:30,378
[loud creak]

200
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,513
[creaking continues]

201
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,342
What was that?[loud scraping, thud]

202
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,181
Mm-mmm.Oh. Oh.

203
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,835
Gentlemen first, okay?

204
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,578
[wind whistling]

205
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,407
[Chris]
Did you leave that open?No.

206
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:09,722
[Margot gasping,
laughing]

207
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,856
You'’re such a scaredy-cat.

208
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,249
It'’s adorable.

209
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,252
Oh, gosh.

210
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,601
[screams]

211
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,955
Eli, what are you
doing here?

212
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:40,579
[door closes][Samuel]
Here. I got it.

213
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,326
Uh, may I?Oh, no, it'’s okay.
Thank you.

214
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:53,635
Oh, hi, puppy.

215
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,072
[snarling, barking][Jacob shouts]

216
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,074
Sorry.

217
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:59,336
[Jacob]
This way.

218
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:10,652
All right, I'’m this way.
So you guys sleep tight.

219
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,959
I'’ll be, uh, in there.

220
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,135
See you in the morning.Good night.

221
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,138
[Jacob]
Your room is over here.[Chris mutters] What the fuck?

222
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:24,797
Wow.

223
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,582
Oh, it'’s beautiful.

224
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,889
[Jacob] There'’s more wood
by the stove.

225
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,934
If you need anything,
let me know.Okay.

226
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,241
Good night.It'’s perfect.
Thank you so much.

227
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,637
Hey, Jacob, actually, um...

228
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,858
Thank you.
That means so much.Good night.

229
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,650
[Chris] Okay.
So, what'’d he say?

230
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,829
He said, "Thank you so much
for bringing Eli home,"

231
00:12:57,003 --> 00:13:00,920
and he'’s really grateful,
so we can stay
for a couple of days.

232
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:03,226
With our cameras?He said, "Okay."

233
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,315
Hey! Yes![chuckles]

234
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:08,754
It'’s so weird,
like, I was so...

235
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:13,715
I mean, it was the first
people I'’ve ever seen
who are related to me.

236
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,588
Yeah, that'’s your family.I was wondering
if we'’d look alike.

237
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,766
[Margot] Dale, you
don'’t fit on the bed.
[laughs]

238
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,724
Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

239
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:25,422
I'’m used to it.
I sleep on a full at home.

240
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,599
Why do you sleep
on a full?
You'’re, like, 6'’7".

241
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,298
I share a room with my mom,
and she takes the queen.

242
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:33,692
You sleep with your mom?Yeah, yeah.

243
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,302
She lives with me, so...

244
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:36,607
I don'’t-- Yeah.

245
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,479
[Margot, Dale laugh]

246
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,828
What?That'’s sweet.

247
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,007
[Margot whispers]
Chris?

248
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:46,617
Chris?What?

249
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,793
Look.

250
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,145
What'’s up?

251
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:03,591
[Chris] What the hell?
It'’s, like, 2:00 in the morning.

252
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,245
Are those people?

253
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,335
[dog barking, faint]

254
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,731
Yeah, I hope so.

255
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,689
I mean,
what else could it be?

256
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:17,126
It'’s like they'’re going
into the forest.

257
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,699
[dog continues barking]

258
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,440
[Margot]
What the fuck?

259
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:32,707
That was weird.

260
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:41,107
[wind whistling]

261
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:45,938
[sheep bleats]

262
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,681
[Chris]
I got some cool B-roll
this morning.

263
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:54,990
[Chris chuckles]Froot Loops.

264
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:57,384
[Dale] Did you know
that they could eat
Froot Loops?

265
00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:00,169
[Chris]
It'’s cereal, dude,
not a computer.

266
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:02,868
[Dale] Hey.[Chris]
You don'’t have to do this.

267
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:06,436
I love your dress.
It'’s so pretty.
Did you make that?

268
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,917
No. It'’s from Walmart.

269
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,876
Do you have TikTok?

270
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,357
Uh, no, not on my phone.I do. I gotta show you
this video I made.

271
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:17,056
Mary, stop ruching around.

272
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:21,582
[running footsteps]

273
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,279
Sorry, Levina.
Sorry, sorry.

274
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:24,541
Good morning.[Margot]
Good morning.

275
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,195
[foreign language]

276
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,458
Sorry.
Just trying to give you
some local flair.

277
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:29,764
It means, "How are you?"

278
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,984
Hi!Hi, Eli.

279
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:33,202
[Dale]
What'’s up, dude?

280
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:34,813
Um--

281
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:37,163
Hey, Eli. Eli.

282
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:42,211
So do you all have any plans
for the day, or...

283
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:47,129
Um, we would love to see
the rest of your home.

284
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:49,088
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

285
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:52,526
I know the elders like Jacob
can feel kind of intense,

286
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,702
but as long
as you stick with me,
you'’ll be fine.

287
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:57,270
Don'’t approach anybody
in the community without
asking their permission.

288
00:15:57,444 --> 00:16:00,751
Everybody'’s really nice,
but they can be a little shy.

289
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:05,104
Um-- Oh, the woods,
I would avoid those.
We get bears.

290
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,021
And I'’ll be with you,
but they get kind of violent
during the winter.

291
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:12,546
[Chris] Actually, we saw
some people going into the
woods last night, super late.

292
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,201
Yeah, that was
probably a hunting party.

293
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,117
Somebody'’s cow
got attacked, so...

294
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,162
Oh. Okay.Yeah.

295
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,037
I feel like everyone
seems relatively young.

296
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:28,954
So how long
has the family been here?

297
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:32,696
A long time.
About 200 years, I think.

298
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:35,482
200 years?Yeah.

299
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,440
Watch the fire here.[metal clanking]

300
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,486
So this is the workshop.

301
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,882
Fix horseshoes,
equipment, wheels.Wow.

302
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,319
[Margot]
Work '’em young.
[chuckles]

303
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,625
[Samuel]
Yeah, everyone
has a purpose.

304
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,889
He'’s not used to strangers.
Come on.

305
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,937
Where did my mom live
when she was here?

306
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:59,158
I think she was in the room
above yours, but we just
use it as storage now.

307
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,507
Oh.

308
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,075
You wanna see the barn?Yeah.

309
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:07,035
[cows mooing][gasps] Oh, my gosh,
there'’s so many cows.

310
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,910
What'’s all the bags?Uh, it'’s salt.

311
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,868
You know, for the animals
and ice.

312
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:15,435
[pigs oinking]

313
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,090
Are those pigs? Stop.Also got some pigs.

314
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,919
Come on.

315
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,529
There'’s pigs.Okay, come on over.

316
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:24,270
Guys, get in.

317
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,315
They really like...Dale, get in.

318
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,056
No, you don'’t have to
get the shot.

319
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,493
Just, you have to
experience the pigs, okay?

320
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,409
You could put
your boom mic--
Yeah.

321
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,542
Yeah, g-get his dialogue.

322
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:37,457
Stop.Hey, what'’s the scoop?

323
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:40,982
Sir, what'’s the scoop?I gotta get a shot
of these guys too.

324
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:43,332
It'’s too cute.Do they all have--

325
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:46,031
How do I say this?
Like, nice butts like that?

326
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,949
You guys wanna see the loft?[Margot]
Yes.

327
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,041
Oh, hey.Oh, my God, Sam.

328
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:58,347
It'’s pretty cool,
right?It'’s huge.

329
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:01,350
Well, we got
a lot of animals to feed,
especially during the winter.

330
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,744
It'’s beautiful.[Chris]
You'’re gonna do my job too?

331
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,051
You'’re in
the center of my frame.That'’s what we'’re doing?

332
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,053
[screams]

333
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,750
[Chris]
Shit, man.[Samuel] Okay.

334
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,578
Sorry. You okay?

335
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:13,580
Yeah.I'’m so sorry.
There'’s a bale drop there.

336
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:16,017
You gotta be careful.[Chris] That wouldn'’t have
been too good.

337
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,671
Shish kebab, you know?

338
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:19,586
I wasn'’t paying

00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:04,530
[creaking continues]

516
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,087
You gotta be kidding me.

517
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:41,523
Fuck.

518
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:45,049
How do I get out of here?

519
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:50,793
Okay.

520
00:34:58,453 --> 00:34:59,454
[screams]

521
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:01,891
Fuck.

522
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,764
[panting]

523
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,984
[sighs] God.

524
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,119
[wind whistling]

525
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:17,211
This is gonna be interesting.

526
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:30,877
What was it?[Margot]
I don'’t know.

527
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:33,575
I mean, it looks
like a face, right?

528
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,708
It'’s gotta be something else.

529
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:38,580
I mean, a lens distortion.

530
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:41,018
[Margot]
A lens distortion?[Dale] Mmm.

531
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:45,022
Fucking--
See, this is-- No.

532
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:48,242
This is why
I don'’t like creepy old farms.
They'’re always haunted.

533
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,418
[Margot]
Dale, keep your voice down.

534
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:53,247
I'’m serious.
Look at this place. Tell me
it'’s not fucking haunted.

535
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:55,293
[Chris laughing]Really.

536
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:58,861
My cousin Greg saw a ghost
in the walk-in freezer
at a Cracker Barrel.

537
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:01,821
What was he going in
the walk-in freezer for?

538
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,737
He worked there.[laughing]
Okay.

539
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:10,003
Are you really
buying this shit?

540
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:13,050
I mean, I felt
something up there with me.

541
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:16,401
Okay.

542
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,752
So, we'’re ghost hunters now.
Is that it?

543
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:22,189
'’Cause I thought I signed up
for a prestige documentary,

544
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,235
not a fringy
ghost-farm cable show.

545
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:26,324
It'’s not funny, Chris.
It'’s not.

546
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:31,372
I mean, like, the letter,
the creepy drawing.

547
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:35,115
[sighs]And then the little girl saying,
"She'’s still here."

548
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,944
I mean,
something is going on,

549
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:41,991
and it feels like
it has something to do
with my mom.

550
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,125
[Dale]
Yeah, right over there.
That'’d be great.

551
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:49,086
You'’re set. Sorry, just making
sure that-- Doesn'’t matter
if you can see it, right?

552
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:52,089
Dale,
two steps back.

553
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,178
Looks good.

554
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,745
Do I just start?

555
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:59,139
[Chris]
Yeah, when you'’re ready.Mmm.

556
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:03,187
[clears throat, sighs]

557
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,319
Sarah was, um...

558
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:09,367
Sarah was our wildflower.

559
00:37:11,456 --> 00:37:12,979
A nonconformist

560
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:17,505
growing up in a community
whose bedrock is homogeneity.

561
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,116
And, uh...

562
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:22,467
Uh-- [clears throat]

563
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,033
But the, uh...

564
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:28,342
I mean, what...

565
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:32,694
What we all saw as spunky
and free-spirited

566
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,044
when she was
a little girl, um...

567
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:42,487
i-it evolved into
something much darker.

568
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,621
There were several attempts
to take her own life.

569
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,145
What?

570
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,670
When that didn'’t work,
she got pregnant.

571
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:56,109
It was-- It was a boy from town.
She wouldn'’t tell us who.

572
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:00,200
I-- [sighs, clears throat]

573
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:06,075
I suspect she did it
purely out of spite,

574
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,385
as a way to--
to rail against our ways

575
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,821
and our rules.

576
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:15,694
And, uh, that worked.

577
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:18,436
She was shunned.

578
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,959
Shunned.

579
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,441
What, like, sent away?

580
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,530
No, no.

581
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:29,142
Shunning is being separated
from the flock.

582
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:35,061
You eat alone, you work alone,
you sleep alone.

583
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:39,674
And that'’s--
And that is painful, trust me.

584
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,113
[sighs]

585
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,726
I suppose it could be
what drove her away in the end.

586
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,779
I found this letter
in my mom'’s room.

587
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,097
You were in the attic
last night.

588
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,969
What did she mean
when she said,

589
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,189
"You can'’t have me
or my baby"?

590
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,590
We don'’t allow children
out of wedlock.

591
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:30,072
Sarah was required
to give her baby to another
wedded couple in the community.

592
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:36,035
She was forced
to give me away?That'’s right.

593
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,694
That'’s horrible.

594
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:46,959
More horrible
than leaving a newborn
on the ground,

595
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,483
on the sidewalk
like a piece of trash?

596
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:52,573
I loved Sarah.

597
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:55,750
She was my only daughter,
but she cared for nobody
but herself.

598
00:39:57,883 --> 00:39:59,363
That was her sickness.

599
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,542
[Chris]
I get it.

600
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:07,675
It'’s shitty
what they did to her.

601
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,199
Yeah.

602
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:15,988
[sniffles]

603
00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:19,905
[sighs]

604
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,256
But I mean,
she did the right thing
though, right?

605
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:28,261
'’Cause otherwise
I would have been
stuck here forever.

606
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:31,351
For sure.

607
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,006
[sniffles]

608
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:40,708
I ke-- [sighs]

609
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:42,841
I keep thinking
about that little girl.

610
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,845
What she said the other day.

611
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:53,852
[exhales]

612
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:55,593
I have this...

613
00:40:57,203 --> 00:40:59,510
weird feeling
she'’s still here,

614
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:03,209
in the pit of my stomach,
ever since I got here.

615
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:06,691
I can'’t put my finger on it.

616
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:11,652
[sniffles]

617
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:19,007
[drone whirring]

618
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:57,002
[Chris]
All right, not much further.

619
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:59,570
The drone made it seem
like it was right over here.

620
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:04,531
[Dale] I think I would do,
like, a spaghetti
with meatballs right now.

621
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:06,446
Are you that hungry?

622
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:09,101
[Dale]
Would you guys
eat human?

623
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:11,364
[Chris]
No, I would never eat a human.[Dale chuckles]

624
00:42:11,538 --> 00:42:15,542
I would eat a person
faster than I'’d like
to admit, to be honest.

625
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,544
[Chris]
Well, that'’s noted.

626
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:20,286
[Margot]
Look up though.
Look at that.

627
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,635
[Dale vocalizes]
Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh!

628
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:25,726
How far away
are we supposed to go?

629
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,513
Whoa.

630
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:32,951
[Chris] Right?
That'’s what I'’ve been
telling you about.

631
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,127
[Dale]
So it'’s a church.
Whoopee.

632
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:38,870
[Margot] Yeah, but why
would they build a church
all the way back here?

633
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:40,611
It'’s like a mile away.

634
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:42,874
[Chris]
Gotta be where they were going
the other night.

635
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:45,616
[scoffs]
Bears, my ass.

636
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,836
[Dale]
That means a lot of people
walking through here.

637
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,186
[Margot]
Be careful.Watch your step.

638
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,579
Yeah.

639
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,194
"So weit nicht weiter."

640
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,588
Anyone speak German?

641
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:03,590
Yeah, it says, um,

642
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:05,723
"Sweet, nice wiener."

643
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:08,726
[Margot, Chris chuckle]

644
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,162
Man.

645
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,211
Can you pick a lock?Of course. I'’m Black.

646
00:43:19,171 --> 00:43:21,042
Move aside,
please.

647
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,306
No way.

648
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:27,962
Yeah, cousin Greg
used to boost stuff
all the time.

649
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,138
You know, TVs,
cars, whatever.Sorry.

650
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:31,488
[Chris]
Cousin Greg'’s busy.

651
00:43:31,662 --> 00:43:34,273
Cousin Greg
is in prison.

652
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:35,753
Voilà.

653
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:40,322
No, no, stop!

654
00:43:40,497 --> 00:43:43,456
This is a house of worship.
It'’s off limits to you.
No cameras!

655
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,458
[Margot]
Sorry. Yeah.

656
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:47,852
Can we go inside
without the cameras?No, I'’m sorry.

657
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,462
It'’s not permitted.

658
00:43:51,072 --> 00:43:53,858
Lunch is ready
back at the house.
Come with me.

659
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:56,643
Yes. Thanks.

660
00:43:56,817 --> 00:44:00,473
[Dale] What are we doing?
Like a schnitzel thing,
or a sausage?

661
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:03,868
Is that offensive?
I don'’t know
if that'’s stereotyping.

662
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,399
[Dale]
Not for me, not for me.

663
00:44:13,573 --> 00:44:16,228
Thank you so much.

664
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:18,752
There seems to be
a little more.

665
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:21,146
Dale, save some
for everyone else.

666
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,496
Oh, yeah, sorry.

667
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,019
[Chris]
Dude.

668
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:33,419
[people chattering, laughing]

669
00:44:44,778 --> 00:44:47,738
[Chris]
Hey, mind if I film you
for a moment?

670
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,873
[humming softly]

671
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:58,618
[Chris groans]
Fuck.

672
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:00,054
Hey. Hey.[Margot]
Oh, my gosh.

673
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:02,230
Fetch me the first-aid kit.

674
00:45:30,476 --> 00:45:32,696
[animal shrieking]

675
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:35,742
[Chris]
What is that?

676
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,789
[Dale snoring][animal shirking, lowing]

677
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:41,356
[Chris scoffs] No way.

678
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:49,756
[snoring continues]

679
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,107
[animal groaning,
shrieking]

680
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:02,073
[moans softly]

681
00:46:04,118 --> 00:46:05,859
[moans]Shh-shh-shh.

682
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:07,905
What'’s wrong?Shh. Listen.

683
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,254
What?

684
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,387
[animal groans]

685
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,867
What is that?

686
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:16,827
I don'’t know.

687
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:22,310
[high-pitched shriek]

688
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:23,790
What is that?

689
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:28,708
Turn the light off.

690
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:31,232
They'’re gonna see it.
Turn it off.Okay, right.

691
00:46:32,407 --> 00:46:34,932
[animal groaning]

692
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:45,986
What?

693
00:46:59,696 --> 00:47:01,828
[Chris exhales]

694
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:05,397
[animal continues groaning]

695
00:47:05,571 --> 00:47:07,616
[Chris]
Hey, let'’s just go back.

696
00:47:08,748 --> 00:47:12,012
[sighs] Or get closer.

697
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:14,928
[exhales]

698
00:47:17,278 --> 00:47:19,411
[shrieking continues]

699
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,719
[Chris whispers]
I can'’t see shit.

700
00:47:23,676 --> 00:47:25,069
[Margot]
Go upstairs.

701
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,161
[animal groaning]

702
00:47:34,078 --> 00:47:36,080
[Jacob] Hold her down.[groaning continues]

703
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:42,086
[Chris]
What are they doing?

704
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,609
[Margot]
What?

705
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:46,655
[loud shriek]

706
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:51,835
[bleating]

707
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:53,184
[Margot whispers]
What? No.

708
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,450
[bleating continues]

709
00:47:59,538 --> 00:48:01,409
[gasps]

710
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,150
[Chris whispering]
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

711
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:15,119
It'’s starting
to spread.

712
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,903
I know, sister.

713
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:19,950
First the children,
and then the old.

714
00:48:20,124 --> 00:48:23,040
We have to do it now.

715
00:48:23,214 --> 00:48:25,346
[Margot whispering]
What is she talking about?

716
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:29,611
We should follow them.

717
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:53,287
[Margot]Fuck.

718
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:02,122
What are they doing?

719
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,082
[Chris]
Something fucked up.

720
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,747
Why would they put it
in a church?Definitely not to bless it.

721
00:49:24,014 --> 00:49:28,670
We hear this insane
screaming, dying noise
in the middle of the night,

722
00:49:28,845 --> 00:49:31,935
and then we go
and there'’s, like,
a goat sacrifice.

723
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:34,111
Look, animals
get sick, right?

724
00:49:34,981 --> 00:49:36,765
Some have birth defects.

725
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,159
We can'’t feed them,
take care of them.
We do what we have to.

726
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,075
Okay, then why did they
bring the goats
into your church?

727
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,469
I told you
not to go in the church.

728
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:47,428
We didn'’t go in the church,
we saw them--Hey, what'’s going on here?

729
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:49,604
What do you mean?

730
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,780
Thought this was supposed
to be a documentary
about where you'’re from.

731
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,087
And now you'’re
sneaking out at night,

732
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:58,222
and you'’re filming
all kinds of stuff that'’s
not really your business.

733
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:01,616
I'’m trying to help you.
Don'’t make me regret it.

734
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:07,709
[Margot] I don'’t know
what happened to my mom,

735
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:10,321
but I feel like the answers
are in that church.

736
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:13,324
[Chris] Well, they obviously
left Sam behind to babysit us.

737
00:50:14,716 --> 00:50:17,589
So we'’ll have to find a way
to distract him.

738
00:50:19,156 --> 00:50:21,071
All right, who'’s first?

739
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,073
You got it.

740
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,640
[chuckles]
Let'’s go, Dale.

741
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,729
Okay.

742
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:30,994
So you'’re gonna
take both of these reins
in your left hand. Good.

743
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:33,213
Right hand'’s gonna
go around that pommel.

744
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:35,476
Your left foot'’s
gonna go in the stirrup.

745
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,130
And then...

746
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:38,305
Hold that tight.

747
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:39,567
Whoa!

748
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:41,352
You'’re okay.Hey! Look at you.

749
00:50:41,526 --> 00:50:44,659
I told you he likes you.Both hands on the reins.

750
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,705
Good, good.
Both hands, both hands.

751
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:48,446
Okay.
You'’re okay, you'’re okay.

752
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,926
Have fun.[horse whinnying]

753
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,579
No, no, no.Hey!

754
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:53,016
Oh!

755
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,192
Hey, stop![Chris]
You wrong for that.

756
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:58,108
[Samuel] Just pull back
on the reins!Go, Dale.

757
00:50:58,282 --> 00:50:59,936
I'’m squeezing!

758
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,982
[screams]
Stop! Tell him to stop!

759
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:16,169
All right.

760
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:21,566
Voilà.

761
00:51:29,095 --> 00:51:30,444
[door closes]

762
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:35,014
What?

763
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:38,975
[Margot] Where are the pews?

764
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:41,194
I thought this
was supposed to be a church.

765
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,852
Chris.

766
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,942
There'’s paintings
on the ground.

767
00:51:50,116 --> 00:51:51,552
Oh, yeah.

768
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:54,991
Kind of looks like a drawing
that I saw in the attic.

769
00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:57,384
"Asmodeus."

770
00:51:57,558 --> 00:51:58,995
[exhales]

771
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:07,090
Shit.

772
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,095
What the fuck, man?

773
00:52:18,362 --> 00:52:21,234
"The young and the weak
will suffer first"?

774
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:28,372
"Lest sacrifices be made."

775
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,852
Okay.

776
00:52:34,595 --> 00:52:35,770
What is that?

777
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:41,298
Okay...

778
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:43,735
[chuckles]

779
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:47,565
Is that some, like,
Cirque du Soleil stuff?

780
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:59,229
Saw those in the barn.

781
00:53:02,014 --> 00:53:03,537
That'’s a big bell.

782
00:53:05,104 --> 00:53:06,540
Yo, Margot.

783
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:08,368
Margot?Here.

784
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:09,674
Oh.

785
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:11,067
Look.

786
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:14,331
What is that?I think it'’s blood.

787
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:23,427
Okay, hold on one second.

788
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:25,037
Just one second.

789
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:28,084
What?

790
00:53:40,096 --> 00:53:42,098
This thing slides.Don'’t break it.

791
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:44,404
Help me push it over.Why?

792
00:53:44,578 --> 00:53:46,798
One, two...[both grunting]

793
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,758
That'’s it.

794
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:53,239
No way.

795
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,855
Fuck.

796
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:03,467
Holy fuck.

797
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:05,556
Holy fuck.

798
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,087
[Chris]
Whoa.Okay, so what?

799
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:16,306
They just...

800
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,310
threw the dead goats
down there?

801
00:54:20,484 --> 00:54:21,789
But why?

802
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,966
I don'’t know,
some sort of...

803
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:27,795
religious custom?

804
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,971
Fuck.

805
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:33,061
Hey, hey, be careful.

806
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:42,462
[rock clacking]

807
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:46,553
[rock hits bottom][Chris]
Whoa, dude, that'’s--

808
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:48,294
that'’s fucking far, yo.

809
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:55,127
What?

810
00:54:56,824 --> 00:54:59,044
Fuck it.Fuck what?

811
00:54:59,218 --> 00:55:00,524
Fuck what?

812
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:02,482
What? Mm-mmm!

813
00:55:02,656 --> 00:55:05,181
Hard no this time.
We don'’t even know
if this thing is safe.

814
00:55:05,355 --> 00:55:08,096
It'’s here.
I mean, they'’re using it
for a reason.

815
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:11,839
Okay, Margot, I can'’t
just stand here and let you
do this. Come on, now.

816
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:15,016
Chris, we get one shot,
one chance.
I'’m not messing it up.

817
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:16,801
It'’s too important.

818
00:55:16,975 --> 00:55:19,107
Just give me the camera.
Man the pulley. We got this.

819
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,240
The fuck we got this.

820
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:26,245
You sure about this?

821
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:27,768
Yes.

822
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:29,205
It'’s good.

823
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:37,996
Do I look cool?

824
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,606
No, you look crazy.

825
00:55:41,826 --> 00:55:43,131
Don'’t move.

826
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,872
Thank you.

827
00:55:46,004 --> 00:55:47,658
[clears throat, sighs]

828
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:50,051
Okay.

829
00:55:52,837 --> 00:55:56,493
Okay, just...
let it out real slow.

830
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,234
Slow.
[chuckles]

831
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,194
[Margot] Okay.

832
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,762
[Margot gasping]

833
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:06,285
Are you okay?Yeah.

834
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,766
Yeah, I'’m good. Keep going.

835
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,464
[pulley ratcheting]

836
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:23,955
[Chris] You good?

837
00:56:24,129 --> 00:56:25,173
Yep.

838
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:27,872
What am I doing?

839
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,178
[Margot gasps]

840
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:37,577
Jesus, what is that?

841
00:56:38,317 --> 00:56:39,362
[Chris]
What?

842
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:42,669
There'’s a smell.

843
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:43,975
Fuck.

844
00:56:44,845 --> 00:56:46,107
[Margot]
It'’s pretty bad.

845
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:50,590
[Chris]
You okay?

846
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,462
Yeah.

847
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:53,767
I-I'’m good.

848
00:57:02,994 --> 00:57:04,561
What the fuck? What?

849
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:14,266
There'’s crosses everywhere.

850
00:57:15,006 --> 00:57:15,920
[Chris]What?

851
00:57:16,094 --> 00:57:17,748
There'’s crosses everywhere.

852
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:21,099
Do you wanna keep going?

853
00:57:22,143 --> 00:57:23,841
Yeah.

854
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:25,669
Yeah, keep going.

855
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:28,846
[pulley ratcheting]

856
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,768
Ohh.

857
00:57:46,516 --> 00:57:47,560
Okay.

858
00:57:50,476 --> 00:57:52,173
I can see the bottom!

859
00:57:57,527 --> 00:57:58,832
[pulley stops ratcheting]

860
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,270
Chr-- Chris?

861
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:06,579
Chris?

862
00:58:08,189 --> 00:58:09,713
Hey, what'’s wrong?

863
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:16,241
[Chris] It'’s stuck.

864
00:58:17,721 --> 00:58:20,114
Hold on. Hold on.
Something'’s stuck.

865
00:58:26,556 --> 00:58:28,209
So fucking close.

866
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:33,389
I think I can reach it
if I lean.

867
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:39,786
H-- Hey, there'’s something
down here!

868
00:58:41,962 --> 00:58:43,137
A room!

869
00:58:48,752 --> 00:58:49,840
Right.

870
00:58:58,196 --> 00:58:59,850
[Margot grunts]

871
00:59:00,024 --> 00:59:02,940
[water trickling]

872
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,725
[chain rattling,
faint][gasps]

873
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,860
[faint groaning]Okay.
Who was that?

874
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:12,340
Wait, go back.

875
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:14,865
Go back.

876
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:17,781
Who is it? Who...

877
00:59:19,217 --> 00:59:21,437
Hey, Chris, I'’m done.
Pull me up.

878
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:27,225
Hey, please. I'’m serious.
Pull me up.

879
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:32,317
Chris?

880
00:59:33,013 --> 00:59:34,624
Hey, pull me up!

881
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:37,540
[gasping]

882
00:59:43,023 --> 00:59:45,373
[Margot]
Look, if you just listen to it,
then you'’ll understand.

883
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,898
[Chris]
You could'’ve hurt yourself.
You scared the shit out of me.

884
00:59:48,072 --> 00:59:49,813
That'’s all I'’m saying.

885
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,598
It'’s gotta be known,
like, acknowledged at least.

886
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:54,818
I'’ll listen to it,
but it'’s like--[Margot] Okay.

887
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,254
Come on.

888
00:59:57,298 --> 00:59:58,691
I'’m listening to it.

889
00:59:58,865 --> 01:00:00,388
[pulley ratcheting]

890
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,608
[Margot]
Dale, is that booze?

891
01:00:02,782 --> 01:00:05,306
Whiskey, man.
I just fell off
a fucking horse.

892
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:09,180
[Margot]
Chris.

893
01:00:09,354 --> 01:00:10,442
Chris!Okay.

894
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:12,836
[faint growling] Pull me up!

895
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,228
Chris, pull me up!

896
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,013
Pull me up!Go back.

897
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:21,497
[faint growling]

898
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:24,891
[Margot]
You hear that?

899
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:26,545
There'’s something
down there.

900
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:29,983
An animal?

901
01:00:31,855 --> 01:00:34,510
Shit, they'’re throwing goats
down a mine shaft

902
01:00:34,684 --> 01:00:36,947
to feed an animal...

903
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:39,384
in a cave
a hundred feet
underground?

904
01:00:40,864 --> 01:00:42,561
Fuck those guys.

905
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:55,095
[Dale, Chris chattering,
faint]

906
01:01:07,673 --> 01:01:10,023
[Margot] Um, Jacob?

907
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:15,202
[Margot gasps]

908
01:02:22,008 --> 01:02:23,401
[gasps]

909
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:42,594
What?

910
01:03:00,003 --> 01:03:01,091
Fuck.

911
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:03,484
What?

912
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,363
[person talking,
muffled, faint]

913
01:03:12,537 --> 01:03:14,104
[knock on door]

914
01:03:15,235 --> 01:03:17,194
[knocking]

915
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:20,284
Whoa, whoa.

916
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,199
Battery? Totally fucking dead.

917
01:03:22,373 --> 01:03:24,984
[Margot]
They'’ve been watching me.What?

918
01:03:25,158 --> 01:03:28,727
Sam didn'’t leave the community
to find himself.
He left to find me.

919
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:32,862
This whole thing'’s
like a fucking setup.Okay, just slow down. Slow down.

920
01:03:37,257 --> 01:03:38,519
Is everything all right?

921
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:40,696
[Margot]
Yeah, I'’m good.

922
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:44,003
I was feeling a little
under the weather earlier,
but I'’m much better now.

923
01:03:45,962 --> 01:03:47,615
Good.

924
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,356
Thank you.It'’s good to hear.

925
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,624
[Chris] Okay, wait.
I thought they couldn'’t
have computers.

926
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,105
Chris, the emails went back
for over a year.

927
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:01,368
Way before Sam contacted me.

928
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,936
I mean, they knew where I live.
They have my address.

929
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,677
They fucking
have pictures of me.

930
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:08,201
They had my class schedule.What the fuck?

931
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:12,205
They were watching me.
They clearly brought us here
for a reason.

932
01:04:12,379 --> 01:04:14,555
Why would they do that?I don'’t fucking know.

933
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,688
I don'’t fucking know,
but it'’s freaking me out.

934
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:18,821
I wanna go home.

935
01:04:18,995 --> 01:04:22,389
I wanna go.Okay. Okay, okay.
But how?

936
01:04:22,563 --> 01:04:25,479
We have no car,
we have no phone,

937
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,655
and there'’s no one around
for 30 miles.

938
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,440
Fuck.

939
01:04:29,614 --> 01:04:31,181
This is so fucked.

940
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:36,664
Hey.

941
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:38,928
Tomorrow.

942
01:04:39,102 --> 01:04:41,321
Okay? It'’s all good.

943
01:04:41,495 --> 01:04:43,367
First thing in the morning,
we'’ll head into town
and get a battery for the van.

944
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,325
[whimpers]

945
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:50,243
Okay?

946
01:04:53,507 --> 01:04:55,771
[loud thumping]

947
01:05:04,518 --> 01:05:07,173
[gasping, panting]

948
01:05:08,522 --> 01:05:10,133
[hinge creaking]

949
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:12,309
[gasping, panting]

950
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:25,801
Dale, wake up.

951
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,328
Wake up.

952
01:05:31,502 --> 01:05:32,808
Wake up.

953
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:34,548
[thump][hinge creaks]

954
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,854
[Margot] Fuck.

955
01:05:37,029 --> 01:05:38,161
[loud thump]

956
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:39,640
Wake up.

957
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:42,034
[whimpering]

958
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:44,602
[chattering, faint]

959
01:05:44,776 --> 01:05:45,908
What?

960
01:05:49,694 --> 01:05:53,176
[whimpering continues]

961
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,007
Chris, wake up.

962
01:05:58,964 --> 01:06:01,184
Please, wake up!

963
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,230
[thump][footsteps running]

964
01:06:04,404 --> 01:06:06,406
[Margot shouts]
Who the fuck is that?

965
01:06:30,474 --> 01:06:32,258
[roaring]

966
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,829
[screaming, whimpering]

967
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:43,791
[screams]

968
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,229
[low growling]

969
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:49,841
[roaring]

970
01:06:51,016 --> 01:06:52,452
[roaring quiets]

971
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:55,020
[person whispering, faint]

972
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:10,557
[Chris] Margot?

973
01:07:14,387 --> 01:07:15,519
[Dale] Chris.

974
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:22,918
[Chris]
Oh, Jesus Christ.

975
01:07:23,788 --> 01:07:25,659
Hey, Margot. Margot?

976
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,922
Are you okay?

977
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:36,322
She'’s resting again.

978
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:41,371
[Chris]
What was wrong with her?

979
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:45,723
I'’d say it'’s exhaustion
coupled with an unusually
severe menstrual cycle.

980
01:07:45,897 --> 01:07:48,552
She lost a fair amount of blood,
but she'’s going to be fine.

981
01:07:48,726 --> 01:07:50,684
[Dale] Well, shouldn'’t we
take her to a hospital?

982
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,904
No, she doesn'’t need a hospital.
She needs rest.

983
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:56,386
[Chris] Okay, no offense,
but are you even
a real doctor?

984
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,388
Listen,
let her get some rest.

985
01:07:58,562 --> 01:08:01,957
If her condition worsens,
we'’ll get her to a hospital.

986
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:10,530
[Dale]
Unusually strong
menstrual cycle?

987
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:12,750
Do you believe that?

988
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:18,799
[Chris]
Man, this is so stupid.
Nobody'’s coming.

989
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:20,671
You got a better idea?

990
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:23,152
I don'’t see any
Amish auto part stores
around here.

991
01:08:25,763 --> 01:08:27,025
Look.

992
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:28,592
Oh!Ah!

993
01:08:28,766 --> 01:08:30,594
Thank God.Oh, fuck, man. Yes.

994
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:32,378
Oh, thank God.

995
01:08:32,552 --> 01:08:34,163
I think it'’s a mail truck.
Hey!

996
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,123
Hey, man.Hey there.

997
01:08:38,297 --> 01:08:40,343
Will you give us
a ride into town?
Our battery died.

998
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:41,953
Yeah. That'’s all right.Hop in?

999
01:08:42,127 --> 01:08:43,955
Come on in.Thank you.

1000
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:45,174
Thank you so much.

1001
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:47,480
That'’s a nice camera
you got.

1002
01:08:47,654 --> 01:08:49,439
Yeah, we'’re shooting
a documentary
up at the Beiler farm.

1003
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:52,529
Oh, yeah?
What'’s y'’alls documentary about?

1004
01:08:52,703 --> 01:08:54,183
[Chris]
Amish people.

1005
01:08:54,357 --> 01:08:56,141
Amish people?Yeah.

1006
01:08:57,186 --> 01:08:59,579
You guys staying
at the Beiler farm?

1007
01:08:59,753 --> 01:09:03,105
[Chris] Yeah.
Actually, we'’ve been there
for about a week now filming.

1008
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,631
[chuckles] Yeah, all right.
Well, you know the Beilers
ain'’t Amish.

1009
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:10,373
Uh, what?
Of course they are.

1010
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,418
Think they are? Right.

1011
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:15,856
Hey, I'’ve been
working this route
for over 40 years

1012
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:19,338
and I know every family
within a 50-square-mile area,

1013
01:09:19,512 --> 01:09:22,254
and most of them are Amish.

1014
01:09:22,428 --> 01:09:24,082
Now, they all will tell you...

1015
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:27,607
the Beilers ain'’t Amish.

1016
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:31,437
Can I help you?Car battery?

1017
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:33,396
Size?31C.

1018
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,093
Let me go check for you.
Be right back.

1019
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:37,443
[Chris]
Fuck, man.

1020
01:09:37,617 --> 01:09:40,925
Maybe we shouldn'’t have
left Margot, man. Why would
they pretend to be Amish?

1021
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:43,406
I don'’t know. Maybe hiding
in plain sight, right?

1022
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,582
It'’s like... I don'’t know.

1023
01:09:45,756 --> 01:09:48,933
They look like them,
they blend in,
they'’re off the grid.

1024
01:09:49,107 --> 01:09:50,848
It'’s kind of a genius idea.

1025
01:09:51,022 --> 01:09:53,068
Why would they
need to be Amish?
What'’s the point in that?

1026
01:09:53,242 --> 01:09:55,766
What size battery
was it again?Thirty-one C.

1027
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,943
Yeah, I'’m not seeing it here.
I'’m gonna go check
in the back for you.

1028
01:09:59,117 --> 01:10:01,859
[Chris] Hey, you mind
if we use your Internet
for a second?

1029
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,382
Not at all.
Have at it.Cool.

1030
01:10:03,556 --> 01:10:05,602
Just don'’t look up
anything weird.

1031
01:10:05,776 --> 01:10:07,343
Fuck, Dale.

1032
01:10:07,517 --> 01:10:10,085
What do you want me to look up?
"Fake Amish people"?

1033
01:10:10,259 --> 01:10:11,564
No, search "Asmodeus."

1034
01:10:11,738 --> 01:10:13,044
Asmodeus?Yeah.

1035
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:15,133
That'’s the name
we found at the church.

1036
01:10:21,574 --> 01:10:24,099
"The demonic prince of lust,
suffering and wrath.

1037
01:10:24,273 --> 01:10:27,928
Asmodeus, or Asmodaios,
is the overlord
of the Nine Hells.

1038
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,713
He is the prince of demons--"

1039
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,194
I fucking knew it, man.
These people
are devil worshippers.

1040
01:10:32,368 --> 01:10:34,109

01:10:36,937 --> 01:10:40,593
"The Norwegian
village of Beskytter
was beset by a pestilence.

1042
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:43,248
Crops and livestock perished,
neighbor turned against neighbor

1043
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:45,207
in abhorrent acts
of violence."

1044
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:46,860
The same stuff
you saw in the church.

1045
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:50,516
"It was believed to be
the work of the demon, Asmodeus.

1046
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:54,564
In their desperation,
the village turned to
the White Witch for help.

1047
01:10:54,738 --> 01:10:57,393
It is said the witch
trapped the demon
inside a chosen woman of God,

1048
01:10:57,567 --> 01:11:00,831
her body a holy vessel
to ensnare the powerful entity.

1049
01:11:03,094 --> 01:11:05,270
Through her bloodline,
from daughter to daughter,

1050
01:11:05,444 --> 01:11:09,448
the demon, Asmodeus, be passed,
lest it be unleashed
upon the world."

1051
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,669
Fuck, man.

1052
01:11:12,843 --> 01:11:14,540
They trapped them
inside these women'’s bodies?

Okay, come on.

1054
01:11:16,325 --> 01:11:19,719
Like, witches, demons?
Like, th-that'’s not real.

1055
01:11:19,893 --> 01:11:22,505
Even if it'’s not real,
they could still--

1056
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,768
If they believe it,
then think about it.

1057
01:11:24,942 --> 01:11:26,900
Margot'’s mom runs off,
right?

1058
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:30,382
And she hides her baby
to keep her away from
these cultish motherfuckers,

1059
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:32,254
but they still
find her somehow

1060
01:11:32,428 --> 01:11:34,952
and they lure her back to do
whatever this shit is to her.

1061
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:36,997
All right, you guys.

1062
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:38,825

Hey, hey. Mary.
Wait, wait, wait. No.

Mary.

1076
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:17,299

1086
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,505
Where the fuck
is Margot, man?

1087
01:12:52,116 --> 01:12:55,162
Women are
the most powerful creatures
on Earth.

1088
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,251
What?

1089
01:12:56,425 --> 01:12:58,035
Givers of life.

1090

That is why our sisters
bear this burden.

Don'’t try to stop this.Just put the gun down.

1105
01:14:16,722 --> 01:14:19,899
Her body is the only thing
that can hold the demon.

1106
01:14:20,073 --> 01:14:23,207
If you set him free,
he'’ll be able to
possess anyone,

1107
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:24,861
jumping from body to body.

1108
01:14:25,035 --> 01:14:26,689
What are you
doing to her?He'’ll kill us all.

1109
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:29,735
He'’ll kill
every last one of us.Wait.
