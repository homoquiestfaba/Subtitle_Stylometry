1
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,743
Heard anything
from back home?

2
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,778
No, I don't want to
talk about it.

3
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,247
I reckon
my folks gonna be okay.

4
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,651
Big gun collectors,
you know.

5
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,085
Nobody is gonna get within
half a mile of their place.

6
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,621
Can you just stop talking?

7
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,658
Hear that?

8
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,526
Yeah,
it sounds like a rabbit.

9
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,360
Should try to shoot it.

10
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,162
Rations are running low
around here.

11
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,371
Oh, crap!

12
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,744
Shit!

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,322
Sir, wish to report.

14
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,891
-What's happening?
-Sector C, sir.

15
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,458
Just got a breach
about one of those things

16
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,260
-off the news.
-How widespread?

17
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,696
I don't know, sir.
I only saw a handful.

18
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,263
Want me to do
a quick recon, sir?

19
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,632
-Affirmative.
-I'll go with you.

20
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,833
Go.

21
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,037
<i>We're barricaded</i>

22
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,805
<i>inside the officer's mess.</i>

23
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,841
<i>We're holding out,</i>
<i>but I don't know for how long.</i>

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,610
Call Camp Northolt.

25
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,478
Request immediate air cover
and evacuation.

26
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,047
- Yes, sir.
- We're not secure here, sir.

27
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,749
I'm not leaving my post,
Lieutenant.

28
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,651
I don't think we're gonna
make it to anywhere safe.

29
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,081
You hesitate again
and I will fucking shoot you.

30
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,481
Sir, yes sir.

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,452
Sir, Northolt
is under attack as well

32
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,121
and unable
to provide support.

33
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,756
-Any other bases we can call?
-Not at this time, sir.

34
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,925
Sir,
Lieutenant Jenkins calling.

35
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,928
Lieutenant, report.

36
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:15,530
<i>with four others, sir.</i>

37
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,230
<i>Prepared</i>
<i>to take back the camp.</i>

38
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,032
-Good man.
-I hope he gets here in time.

39
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,433
He will.

40
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,239
I haven't been bitten,
it's just a burn.

41
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,341
Fine, leave it.

42
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,580
We seem to be
regaining control, sir.

43
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,782
What levels casualties
have we suffered?

44
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,751
Many personnel were unable
to access weapons.

45
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,619
The enemy are moving so fast,
most never stood a chance.

46
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,755
How long
until we regain control?

47
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,389
Unsure, sir.

48
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,925
But if you'll excuse me,
I'll get back to just that.

49
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,893
Of course, Lieutenant.

50
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,544
It's clear. Come on.

51
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:04,979
Come on.

52
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,291
Oh, shit!
Go back, go back, go back!

53
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,273
Come on!

54
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,422
This just in.

55
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:24,559
All citizens
are to remain indoors.

56
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,093
The military
are on the streets.

57
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,460
But initial reports say

58
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,263
they are unable
to maintain control.

59
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,631
The military
has advised everyone

60
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,967
to barricade their home
and stay inside.

61
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,503
There's no need to go out
to try and find guns

62
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,104
or weapons
to protect yourself.

63
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:39,406
Emergency services
are doing the best they can,

64
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,808
but they are being
overwhelmed

65
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:42,510
by the sheer magnitude
of the disaster.

66
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,679
Ramifications
of this situation

67
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,982
stretched far beyond
the current instability

68
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,218
with the production
of oil at a standstill.

69
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,987
People have been setting fires
in a desperate attempt

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,256
at creating
some form of barricade.

71
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,526
This has been working,
but the fires have spread.

72
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,863
Just as the world
has recovered

73
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:03,363
from one virus,

74
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,067
we now have to
deal with another.

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,902
A virus,

76
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,237
unbelievably,

77
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,305
that seems to be
bringing the dead

78
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,940
back to life.

79
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,914
Can I have you look up?

80
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,985
- Yeah. To the side.
- Attention!

81
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,385
As you were.

82
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,890
What's the status report,
doctor?

83
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,926
Well, as of right now,
General, we're fine.

84
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,062
92% of surviving personnel
suffered scratches,

85
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:36,998
62% serious cuts.

86
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,933
Most, if not all,

87
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,369
suffered possible infection
of said wounds

88
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,537
through hostile blood
or saliva.

89
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,840
So nearly all my soldiers
could be infected?

90
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,376
Could be,
we're monitoring them.

91
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,477
How you feeling,
Corporal?

92
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,346
I'm fine, sir.

93
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,715
I wish I was back outside,
though.

94
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,450
I feel like
I'm wasting my time here.

95
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,054
Well, we need you
back outside,

96
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,222
but don't rush it.

97
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,824
You aren't feeling
any changes?

98
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,526
Let's be honest, sir,

99
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,261
I'm not sure
how I should be feeling.

100
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,765
This whole thing
has left me feeling shook up.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,567
You'll get used to it.

102
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,969
How's the burn?

103
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,039
Healing well, sir.
Nothing else, thankfully.

104
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,374
Very good.
It sounds like you'll be fine.

105
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:21,976
Yes, sir,
I'm sure I will be.

106
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,212
-Sit tight for a minute.
-Okay.

107
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,916
If anything did occur,

108
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,651
how fast
would you expect it to happen?

109
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,453
I'm not--
not entirely sure, sir.

110
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,823
It's just
new territory for us.

111
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,658
We do know
that in death...

112
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,527
it's immediate.

113
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:42,663
Deep bites,
nearly as fast.

114
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,497
However, with infection,

115
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,101
we don't offer
natural immune system

116
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,769
to fight it off.

117
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,571
And that's why I've had
Captain Wahta brought in here.

118
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,975
You think
the taser's going to work?

119
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,443
Taser will work.

120
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,445
They ain't fully turned yet,
then yes.

121
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,913
Well, maybe.

122
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,480
We got the mask
we placed over their head

123
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,149
the first sign
of any trouble.

124
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,318
Then we can place handcuffs,
try to restrain them.

125
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:05,686
Then what?

126
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,188
Then we try
to change 'em back.

127
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,656
And if we can't...

128
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,958
we may have to kill them.

129
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,060
Very good, doctor.

130
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,428
You keep me updated

131
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,629
and check
all exposed personnel

132
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,164
every two hours.

133
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:18,899
Yes, sir.

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,935
I had the guys in bayonets

135
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,670
build it
as strong as possible.

136
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,071
Very good, Captain.

137
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,940
Sir.

138
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,642
one more time.

139
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,026
What is it?

140
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,428
Sorry, sir,

141
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,763
I've got Lieutenant
Henderson's wife outside.

142
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,733
He's still the only one
unaccounted for.

143
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,503
Can't the welfare officer
deal with this?

144
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,204
The welfare officer
is out there with her.

145
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,673
Very well, send her in.

146
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,012
I'm sure you must be
very busy right now.

147
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:48,349
With everyone else, sir,
they know what happened.

148
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,017
They can now go through

149
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,553
the period of mourning
and adjustment.

150
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,721
I'm sorry to disturb you,
General,

151
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,089
but I'd like to know

152
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,490
what has happened
to my husband?

153
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,827
He remains unaccounted for
at this moment, I'm afraid.

154
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,062
The thought of him,
out there,

155
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,064
turned into
one of those things.

156
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,267
It's unlikely.

157
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,469
What little
information we have

158
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,337
tells us they don't retreat,
they just keep coming.

159
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,274
So you think
he might be alive?

160
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,176
We are trying to
ascertain his whereabouts,

161
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,778
all we know for sure
is that he hasn't turned.

162
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:26,053
Sir, I'm reporting
on camp security.

163
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,855
-How's it going?
-Good, sir.

164
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,490
The barbed wire is back up.

165
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:32,793
Every mine we have
is forming an outer perimeter.

166
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:35,496
Only clear way in
is down the main road.

167
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,765
What's to stop them
from coming that way?

168
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,133
Explosives, sir.

169
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,801
We have them
planted in the road

170
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,169
points.

171
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:44,573
They need to be
detonated manually.

172
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,173
Who's in charge
of the explosives?

173
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,075
That Norwegian civilian,
sir.

174
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,579
The one who came
to teach that course.

175
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,146
Right,
when he's finished,

176
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,181
tell him to report
to Lieutenant Whitmore.

177
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,883
-Yes, sir.
-You are dismissed.

178
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,826
Morning, sir.

179
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,328
Lieutenant Whitmore
sends his apologies.

180
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,230
-Is your team ready to leave?
-Yes, sir.

181
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:11,065
Lieutenant Whitmore
would like me to submit

182
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,800
a request for more supplies,
sir.

183
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,169
Sergeant, we gave you
what can be spared.

184
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,938
Reinforcements
will be arriving in 48 hours.

185
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,974
Thank you, sir.

186
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,749
In the midst of chaos,
there is also opportunity.

187
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,153
God help us.

188
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:15,597
We're running
really low on fuel, Sergeant.

189
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,830
Any idea
how much further?

190
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,899
Shouldn't be
too much farther.

191
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,570
Sarge, just how long
are we expected to be here?

192
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,838
You think
there's somewhere better?

193
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,609
Well, it's just not too safe
of a place, that's all.

194
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,843
What,
do you feel safer in camp?

195
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:32,846
-You know what I mean.
-No, I don't.

196
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,082
We'll be fine.

197
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,190
Should be about there.

198
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:45,492
Good. Copy that.

199
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:47,094
It's about time.

200
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,897
Shit, my ass done went numb
fucking miles ago.

201
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:51,999
enough.

202
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,834
Enough?

203
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,202
Man, you've been bitching
the entire way,

204
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,705
can we get about
five minutes?

205
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,709
Enough.
Can it, you guys.

206
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,969
What do you reckon?

207
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,507
The wooden pilings
will be no problem.

208
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,308
That doable?

209
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:49,824
Sure.

210
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,659
Right. Hernandez.

211
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,628
I want you and Eckland
to wire the bridge.

212
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:54,729
Yes, sir.

213
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:56,063
The rest of you,

214
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,499
I want sandbags,
right across here.

215
00:14:58,633 --> 00:14:59,900
There's bags and shovels

216
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:00,869
in the back
of the second Humvee.

217
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,637
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

218
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,707
All right, good.

219
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,241
What's the story
with the ring?

220
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,611
Oh.

221
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,447
Yeah,
it's the law of nature.

222
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,017
Life eats life.

223
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,220
Look,
I got your back out here...

224
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,957
but we can't be friends.

225
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,396
LT.

226
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,065
You notice that?

227
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,836
Okay, Lynn, Rudd,

228
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,370
I want you guys
to scout ahead.

229
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:40,542
If you encounter any hostiles,
do not engage.

230
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:41,709
Understood?

231
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:42,744
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:43,845
Go.

233
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,112
The rest of you,

234
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,380
I want
filling those sandbags.

235
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:49,584
I want a defensive position
by nightfall.

236
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,984
Sir.

237
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,362
Is that all we got?

238
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,566
It's what I was given.

239
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:07,134
These cables and detonators
are, like, ancient.

240
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,369
Whatever happened
to the ordinance

241
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,905
I was given for my course?

242
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,208
They are probably planted
around the camp's perimeter.

243
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,276
This is what was left.

244
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,345
Can you do this?

245
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,280
I can rig it up...

246
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,550
but I don't know
if it will work.

247
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,286
Okay.
Get to it.

248
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,957
Go on.

249
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,617
So, he's good to go?

250
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,252
Well, Colonel,
yes, he's fine.

251
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,622
Whoa, not you.
Have a seat.

252
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,189
I feel fine, sir.

253
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,658
I haven't been
within a mile of those things.

254
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,259
It doesn't matter.
I need you to have seat.

255
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,126
Get your gear,
get ready to leave.

256
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,160
Yes, sir.

257
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,563
Sir, if you're good,

258
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,464
the General would like
to see you now.

259
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,640
Colonel Cherone, sir.

260
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,751
Good to see you, Colonel.

261
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,418
General,
I just wish it was under

262
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:33,387
-better circumstances.
-Indeed.

263
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,923
How many men
have you brought with you?

264
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,356
My driver.

265
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,692
Colonel,

266
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,561
my ranks were heavily
depleted yesterday.

267
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:42,396
I need the National Guard
to assemble immediately.

268
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,399
General, I understand.
My communications are down.

269
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,268
What men I do have
are searching for what's left.

270
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,772
I'm not even sure how many men
are still alive, sir.

271
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,205
Very well.

272
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,308
What intelligence
have you gathered?

273
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,946
Little, unreliable
and prone to rapid change.

274
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,147
What's a safe zone today
could be attacked

275
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,983
-and change in an hour.
-Understood.

276
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,751
That's what happened
to Northolt.

277
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,385
24 hours ago.

278
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,789
Before that base was overrun,
they made a report

279
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:10,390
of a large number of hostiles
heading their way.

280
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,192
Sir,
if Northolt was overrun,

281
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,361
the enemy's ranks
are likely much higher now.

282
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:15,897
I'm assuming so.

283
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,098
They were last seen
heading south.

284
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,568
Providing
they don't change direction,

285
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,070
they'll soon be
hitting the river.

286
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,404
The only way across
is that bridge there.

287
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,841
I'm sending Lieutenant Whitmore
and his team

288
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,342
to defend that bridge

289
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,545
or blow
if absolutely necessary.

290
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:32,513
I'm relying on you

291
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,414
to provide
enough reinforcements.

292
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,149
All due respect, sir,

293
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,117
why not just blow the bridge
straight away?

294
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,153
Because,
after this area's cleared,

295
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,056
I plan on
taking back this country

296
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,423
piece by piece.

297
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:45,425
I need
all infrastructure intact.

298
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,494
Understood, sir.

299
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,196
Colonel,
this has to be done quickly.

300
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,304
-Godspeed.
-Thank you, sir.

301
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,813
Any update
on the fuel search, sir?

302
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,314
Nothing so far.

303
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,883
And they keep on moving
further and further out.

304
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,251
We just have to get lucky,
just one time.

305
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,621
Well, how many times
have we been unlucky, sir?

306
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,723
That is none of your concern,
Lieutenant,

307
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:17,659
when they find gas,
they'll bring it in.

308
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,662
Have they tried
siphoning it out of cars?

309
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,864
My men
have done everything

310
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,666
apart from digging for oil.

311
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,801
When they find it,
they'll bring it in.

312
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:29,704
I'm sorry, sir,
but I really need that fuel.

313
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,371
You and everybody else.

314
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:34,341
I have the National Guard
begging me for supplies.

315
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,810
The National Guard?

316
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,444
Well, then,
how are they supposed to

317
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:38,680
send reinforcements
to the bridge?

318
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,648
Then I guess
you better start

319
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,315
praying for them,
Lieutenant.

320
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:43,785
Yes, sir.

321
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,133
-You reckon we take this?
-Yeah, I guess so.

322
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,233
All right.

323
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,776
Get off, you creep!

324
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:53,955
At the end
it's always yes.

325
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,423
Hey!

326
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:58,192
Get off of her.

327
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,927
Look what we got here,
honey.

328
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:01,729
Soldier boy.

329
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:04,599
Get off of her.
Just walk away.

330
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,234
Seems to me,

331
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,335
you boys need to
wait your turn.

332
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,538
Back off, now!

333
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,242
I'll be back.

334
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,043
Hey, don't even
think about it.

335
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,979
-Back off!
-If I don't?

336
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,379
I'll put you down.

337
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:22,083
I don't think
you boys got the balls.

338
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:24,752
Don't do it.
Back up!

339
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,291
Dammit.
What did I tell those two?

340
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,392
Do you want me to go?

341
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,928
Stay here with Eckland.

342
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,696
Make sure
the bridge gets wired.

343
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:38,933
And if a hoard approaches,
blow the bridge.

344
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,535
What about you?

345
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:41,936
If a hoard of those things
makes it to the bridge,

346
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,137
we're dead already.

347
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,740
-Just worry about the bridge.
-Will do.

348
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:48,042
Sharrock,
you're on guard.

349
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,044
The rest of you, on me.

350
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,546
I can get the Humvee, sir.

351
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,514
Leave it.
We're on foot.

352
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:55,783
I wouldn't trust
driving across this bridge.

353
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,789
Hey, you okay?

354
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,726
Are you alone?

355
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:10,231
No, uh,
there's a group of us.

356
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,699
Over at Lacquerie.

357
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,935
Okay,
let's get you there.

358
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:27,882
What the hell
happened to you?

359
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,083
It's okay.

360
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,018
None of your business,
Will.

361
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:34,822
These two
do something to you?

362
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,958
Would we be here if
we had?

363
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:38,559
Was I asking you?

364
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:42,597
Les, go get Big Jim.

365
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:49,369
We got trouble.

366
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,305
Some soldiers have turned up
with Susan.

367
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,707
I'll deal with it.

368
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:59,013
What happened here?
What did you do to her?

369
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,815
This girl here
almost got raped,

370
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:04,018
-that's what happened.
-No, no, it wasn't them.

371
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,720
It was Dale Harper.

372
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,321
What's that about, Dale?

373
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:10,524
No way,
my husband wouldn't do that.

374
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,693
I'll speak with him later.

375
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:15,495
Yeah,
that's gonna be hard.

376
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:20,568
You need
to get out of here.

377
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:21,903
Put that gun down,
little girl.

378
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,571
Put down,
we don't want this.

379
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,307
Enough.
Erin, step back.

380
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,609
I'm trying to protect us.

381
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,611
I'll deal with this.
Step back.

382
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,281
- We ain't afraid to die!
- No!

383
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,916
Back off!

384
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,984
They can't shoot us all.

385
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:40,688
Back off. Back off! Back off!

386
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:42,690
We're going to
tear you apart!

387
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:45,393
Enough!
Enough, all of you!

388
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,595
Get the fuck out of here.

389
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:52,099
Now get back.
Stand down.

390
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,168
Looks like
we have enough now.

391
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,369
Lin, enough.

392
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,405
Now, what started
all of this?

393
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,640
This woman right here,
she was being attacked, sir,

394
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:00,942
and we had to step in.

395
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:03,945
That's right, Lieutenant.
We gave him a chance.

396
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,347
What do you mean,
you gave him a chance?

397
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:10,051
Sir, he tried attacking us.
I had to put him down.

398
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,420
You shot Dale?

399
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:14,322
You shot my husband,
you China--

400
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,623
- Get off of--
- Help!

401
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:17,224
Oh, hell no.

402
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:19,727
You stay down!

403
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,494
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

404
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:22,763
Nothing,
just came for a look.

405
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,265
Hey,
you drop that knife.

406
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:25,599
Think I'll hold on to it
for now.

407
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:26,834
You drop it
or I'll drop you.

408
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:29,203
Please don't.
It's true.

409
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,672
They stopped Dale.

410
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,674
You be saying anything
when they got guns on us.

411
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,043
Chet, drop the blade.

412
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,846
Susan, get back.

413
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:41,082
-But, but--
-Go on.

414
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,754
Lower your weapons.

415
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,458
I should warn you,
you're not safe here.

416
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:53,327
A large number of hostiles
is headed this way.

417
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,930
You need to pack up
and get across the river.

418
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,933
Hm, I think
we're safer off here.

419
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:01,002
Yeah, you ain't exactly
made a good first impression

420
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,170
coming in here like
a bunch of storm-troopers.

421
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,639
Let's go. Come on.

422
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,210
Yeah, like I said,
get the fuck out of here.

423
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,116
Fucking assholes.

424
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,218
All right, man,
let's all calm down.

425
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:19,286
Let's go back
to whatever you're doing.

426
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,560
What happened?

427
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,266
It was Dale,
he tried to--

428
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,371
I'm so sorry.

429
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:39,540
I should have been there.

430
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:42,143
I freaking knew
he was trouble.

431
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,879
If those soldiers
hadn't turned up...

432
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:47,581
I don't know
what would've happened.

433
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,476
She was a pretty hot kid.

434
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,546
I kinda wished
I had saved her.

435
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:18,913
Oh, knock it off,
will you?

436
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:22,116
Well, you might just be in
for a thank you later.

437
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,991
-How we doing?
-Okay.

438
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:05,860
Got one line rigged.

439
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:07,761
If it works,
it should be enough

440
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:09,363
-by itself.
-Sure.

441
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:12,133
While you're doing that,
I'll try and make contact.

442
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,001
-Sure.
-Carry on.

443
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,809
Echo-Five-Whiskey.
Calling Eagle One. Over.

444
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,313
Excuse me, General,

445
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,149
Lieutenant Whitmore
calling, sir.

446
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:32,853
Echo-Five-Whiskey,
this is Eagle One.

447
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:34,355
Is the location secure?

448
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:35,624
The bridge is secure.

449
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,858
No sign
of any hostiles here, sir.

450
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:41,929
We did encounter civilians.
A refugee camp nearby.

451
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:43,297
Did you offer them
protection?

452
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,899
<i>Yes, sir. Refused.</i>

453
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,734
Then they are not your concern.
Stay in position.

454
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,702
Any news
on the reinforcements?

455
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,204
<i>Not yet.</i>
<i>You'll be advised. Out.</i>

456
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,239
You keep trying
to raise the guard.

457
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:53,440
Yes, sir.

458
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,676
Shit.

459
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:01,215
That's-- that's that.

460
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,416
Yeah.

461
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,719
-Hey, Sanders.
-Yeah?

462
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,123
You ever wonder what's going on
with your folks?

463
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:10,958
What do you mean?

464
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,194
Mine are in Sacramento.

465
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,462
There aren't any friends
or relatives nearby.

466
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,399
-They don't even own a gun.
-Stop.

467
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,135
Stop, you have to get that
out of your mind, all right?

468
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:23,837
-My folks are in Chicago.
-Mm-hmm.

469
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,508
Even before
all this madness,

470
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:28,876
I had to force myself
to stop worrying about 'em.

471
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,344
It'll just drive you crazy.

472
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:33,781
Like Sharrock?

473
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:41,855
Hell no,
not like Sha--

474
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,791
Look, I knew Sharrock
from back in the day.

475
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,695
He was just as big
an asshole then,

476
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:49,063
than he is now,
if you can believe that.

477
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,497
, right?

478
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,669
- He's a terminal asshole.
- Yeah.

479
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,703
Lieutenant!

480
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:29,803
Shit!

481
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:42,483
What is it?

482
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,754
Something pulled the detonator
over the edge.

483
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,154
I'll get it.

484
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,266
Oh, shit!

485
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,368
Pull! Pull him up!

486
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:03,804
Pull him up!

487
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,106
Oh, what the fuck?

488
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,012
What the hell
could've done that?

489
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,350
It's heading
for the riverbank.

490
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,753
I want this animal killed.

491
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,287
Hernandez, Eckland,

492
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:21,822
stay here
and recover the detonator.

493
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,157
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

494
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:43,511
Spread out.

495
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,238
-What is that?
-I don't know.

496
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:28,355
-What are you shooting at?
-I don't know.

497
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,659
I saw something moving,
but it was so fast, I, uh--

498
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:33,160
What kind of animal was it?

499
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:34,796
It wasn't an animal.

500
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:36,865
And it wasn't one
of those things either.

501
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,932
Then what was it,
Sanders?

502
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:41,636
I don't know.

503
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:44,371
I don't know.

504
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,273
Wait.

505
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,142
Where's Frost?

506
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,077
He was behind me, LT.

507
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,847
Spread out. Find him.

508
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,682
We'll meet
back at the bridge.

509
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:12,132
Shit!

510
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:18,972
Oh, shit!

511
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:20,642
Here we go again.

512
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,611
I hate doing this shit.

513
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:26,915
Don't worry Sanders,
if you turn,

514
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,716
I'll take care of your ass.

515
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,083
Uh, thanks.

516
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:31,452
That makes me feel
a lot better.

517
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:32,953
Sure, man.
What are friends for?

518
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,261
We got lucky.

519
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,430
It's still attached
to the cables.

520
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,099
Good job.

521
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,575
Man, if you ask me,

522
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,543
you just throw him
over the side.

523
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,846
-What's wrong with you man?
-Nobody's asking you, Sharrock.

524
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:00,247
Nobody ever asks you,
Sharrock.

525
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,649
Yeah, whatever.

526
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:04,485
Did Frost show?

527
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:06,086
No.

528
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,690
Just put him
out of your mind, kid.

529
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,407
Lieutenant!

530
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,013
Sir,
something took Rudd's body.

531
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,816
Jesus, what next?

532
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:37,351
It must have been that animal
from last night.

533
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,353
What is this thing?

534
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:43,390
It doesn't matter.
I want his body found.

535
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:44,959
Start searching.

536
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,193
Sir, it took his body
this way.

537
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:47,996
All right.
Spread out.

538
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:49,998
- All right.
- Sir.

539
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,200
Shit!

540
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,341
Shit!

541
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:45,118
Oh, crap.

542
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,225
Well, at least we know
what it is now.

543
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,895
You think this thing
was underneath the bridge

544
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:55,029
last night?

545
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,397
No way. Unlikely.

546
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:00,100
Are you an expert now,
Lin?

547
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:01,869
No, ma'am.

548
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,738
Sarge, we're going to
have to deal with this.

549
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:04,939
He's gonna turn.

550
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:06,541
I'll take care of it,
Sarge.

551
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:07,909
I've been wanting to
do this anyway.

552
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,409
Not you, Sharrock.

553
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,180
I'm now in charge.

554
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:14,816
This falls on me.

555
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:38,840
Eagle One,
this is Echo-Five-Hotel.

556
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,440
Come in, over.

557
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:42,610
Sir, we have Echo-Five-Hotel
on the phone, sir.

558
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:45,212
-Hotel?
-Yes, sir.

559
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:52,553
Echo-Five-Hotel,
this is Eagle One.

560
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:54,122
Where is Echo-Five-Whiskey?

561
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:55,690
Dead.

562
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,059
With one other confirmed dead
and one missing.

563
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,861
By hostiles?

564
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,730
Echo-Five-Whiskey, yes.
The other, uncertain.

565
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:03,931
Uncertain?

566
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,934
Yes, sir.
Some sort of animal.

567
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,671
Awaiting
further instructions.

568
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:11,839
Stay on mission,
Sergeant.

569
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,342
Yes, sir.
Any news on reinforcements?

570
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:16,878
None yet.
You'll be advised. Out.

571
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:22,016
Still no news
on reinforcements?

572
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,383
No.

573
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:25,620
So, they're at least
two days out...

574
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:27,622
-Perhaps.
-...if they come at all.

575
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:28,756
They're coming.

576
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,490
Even with just
the six of us,

577
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,093
we only have
enough supplies

578
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:33,360
for no more
than two days, Sarge.

579
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:34,896
Hey, Sarge,

580
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:36,463
why don't we just pay a visit
to the families?

581
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:38,533
Requisition
whatever food they got.

582
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,434
So if they had a lot

583
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:41,836
then the lieutenant
would've taken some yesterday.

584
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,303
They probably
haven't eaten in weeks.

585
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:45,173
Shit,
if food was that short,

586
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:46,774
I'd hide it in the woods.

587
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:50,078
Okay, tomorrow we go.

588
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,478
Locklin and I
will go to camp,

589
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,147
you two
circle through the woods

590
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,150
and then Eckland will stay here
and guard the bridge.

591
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:57,985
And what about Lieutenant?

592
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,353
I think the body
would be gone by tomorrow.

593
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:02,557
We stake it out tonight.

594
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,926
Locklin,
you're on guard duty first.

595
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,426
Roger that, Sarge.

596
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:07,795
-All right, let's head out.
-Yes, ma'am.

597
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:45,166
Where's Locklin?

598
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:47,267
I think
that was him that screamed.

599
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,770
So I guess that's it, huh?

600
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,470
We can just leave.
Right, Sarge?

601
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:53,040
-Negative.
-God, you gotta be kidding me.

602
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,642
The reinforcements
will be here soon.

603
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:56,309
That's bullshit
and you know it.

604
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:57,444
Here's the deal.

605
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,180
You're gonna call this in

606
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:01,716
and if they can't give you
a definite answer, we leave.

607
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:02,984
That's it.

608
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,619
I'm not making deals
with you, Sanders.

609
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:05,920
Oh, God.

610
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:07,789
We don't have the fuel
to get back, okay?

611
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:09,456
How long do you think
survive out there?

612
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,357
- Longer than here.
- Right.

613
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,726
I know that.

614
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,194
No, Sanders,
I think we should stay.

615
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:14,061
I don't want to
go out there.

616
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,332
There's something there.

617
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,903
Hold your fire.

618
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:27,575
-It's this way.
-Okay.

619
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,477
-So what's she like man?
-She's okay.

620
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:34,015
I'll tell you what, man,
she's got a freaking heartbeat,

621
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:35,183
I'm interested.

622
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,051
Don't try
like that.

623
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:39,053
Come on, man,

624
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:40,420
Sharrock can't be too picky
these days,

625
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:41,622
you know what I'm saying?

626
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:43,257
We gotta be civilized.

627
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,358
In this?

628
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,103
Sarge, on the left.

629
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,039
More of you?

630
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:00,575
Ain't you done
enough damage already?

631
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:01,943
We're not here
to see you.

632
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,476
I know
you ain't here to see me.

633
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:06,379
I ain't some sad bitch
you can push around.

634
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,149
Hey, hey,
take it easy, tough guy.

635
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,117
Yeah, I'm a tough guy.

636
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:11,786
We all are.

637
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,353
We know
you don't want us here.

638
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:14,622
- Want you here?
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:17,058
Shit,
you'd be torn apart.

640
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,926
Why don't you give it a rest,
huh, man?

641
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,127
Calm down.

642
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:22,096
What are you doing here?

643
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:24,732
One of your men
kills my husband,

644
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:27,301
you just walk back in here,
like nothing happened?

645
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,003
I'm sorry for your loss.

646
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:30,872
It was regrettable.

647
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,573
- Regrettable?
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:34,675
You call my husband's murder
regrettable?

649
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,744
Look, it wasn't a murder.
He had no choice.

650
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:38,980
You just talk to the girl,
she'll tell you what happened.

651
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:40,548
I don't need
to speak with her.

652
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,017
I don't need
to hear her lies.

653
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,888
Maybe you should.

654
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:53,728
-How is she doing?
-Not good. Not good at all.

655
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,364
She's too scared
to come out of the tent

656
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,565
most of the time.

657
00:39:57,932 --> 00:39:59,634
I can imagine
how hard it is.

658
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,869
This has been hard
for all of us, this business.

659
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:03,037
But this...

660
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,705
this is the end.

661
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,141
-Why not leave?
-And go where?

662
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:09,543
My son's a good man,
but when his wife died--

663
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:11,379
If you come with us now,

664
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:12,780
you and the girls
will be safe.

665
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:14,315
There's nothing
he can do with us here.

666
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:15,750
I can't do that.

667
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,585
He's so good

668
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:19,053
and he's been trying
so hard for us.

669
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:21,454
And he's so tired,
we're all so tired.

670
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:22,990
I know.

671
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,126
Sarge.

672
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,300
Why are you people
back again?

673
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,634
It's just a courtesy visit.

674
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:36,704
We encountered a couple
of those things yesterday.

675
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:38,806
Bound to be more
in the area.

676
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,375
Yeah, well,
we'll be fine.

677
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:43,978
How many spare rounds you got?

678
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,613
Enough.

679
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,982
Look, if they come through,
it's gonna be fast.

680
00:40:48,382 --> 00:40:50,418
You and a couple of handguns
ain't gonna cut it.

681
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,153
You know,
you need to leave.

682
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,522
Every time you come here,
you bring trouble.

683
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:55,923
Look, man,
we're sorry about all that,

684
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:58,359
but you just talk to her,
she--

685
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,928
I don't wanna
talk about that.

686
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:03,197
How you doing for food?

687
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:05,399
Barely surviving.

688
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,535
Was hoping
maybe you guys help--

689
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:09,003
can help us out here.

690
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,204
Wish I could.

691
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:11,605
We've got nothing.

692
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:13,007
Yeah, well...

693
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:15,977
we're pretty much
near the end.

694
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,412
And soon we'll know

695
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:20,181
if we've been deemed
worthy or not.

696
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:21,382
Look...

697
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,885
whatever you do have,
start rationing.

698
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,221
Keep an eye out
for hostiles.

699
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:29,857
We'll take a look
around at the perimeter.

700
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:32,226
You can do that
if you want, but...

701
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:35,596
we're pretty much
in the hands of fate right now.

702
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,566
Let's go.

703
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:56,617
Hey, where do you think
they hid the food?

704
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:58,252
Probably a pie.

705
00:41:58,753 --> 00:41:59,987
To keep it away
from the animals.

706
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:02,023
-Yeah, that's a good idea.
-Yep.

707
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,160
Hey, apples.

708
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:07,695
Think they're edible?

709
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:09,330
Oh, yeah.
They're in season.

710
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:12,233
Take your ass up there
and get some.

711
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,102
Fine.
What are you gonna do?

712
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:17,238
Make a sweep.
Make sure everything's secure.

713
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,006
I'll meet you
right here, man.

714
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,475
-Okay.
-You're okay?

715
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:22,877
I got it.

716
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:41,662
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold up, old man.

717
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:43,597
What are you doing
out here?

718
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,534
No-- nothing.

719
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,934
Nice little stroll
through the woods.

720
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:48,769
Yeah, yeah,
that's what it is.

721
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:50,271
Where's the food stash?

722
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,973
I don't know,
I'm looking for it myself.

723
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:10,624
So there is one?

724
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:12,226
I think so, yeah.

725
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,661
-Great.
-Yeah, I think--

726
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,596
-Well, it's not for you.
-What?

727
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:25,840
Oh, fuck.

728
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:37,818
-Get outta here.
-But--

729
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:39,386
-Now! Go!
-But--

730
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:41,021
Go! Go!

731
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,694
What now, kid?
Shit.

732
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:58,072
Yeehaw, motherfucker.

733
00:43:58,205 --> 00:43:59,574
Die, bitch.

734
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,375
All right, motherfucker.

735
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,014
Oh, oh.

736
00:44:07,848 --> 00:44:09,016
Thank God.

737
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,251
Thank God?
Thanks, Sharrock.

738
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,652
Now shut the fuck up

739
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:12,887
and let's get
the fuck outta here.

740
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,055
-What about the families?
-Man, fuck the families.

741
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:17,224
You need to start thinking
about your fucking self.

742
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,099
You think we should leave?

743
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,501
I can't.

744
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,204
I need to take care of
father and grandma.

745
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,872
I hate to say this,

746
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:33,374
but don't you think
we should be a little selfish?

747
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:36,343
I can't.

748
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:41,215
That soldier
seemed to like you.

749
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,054
He may be the only one.

750
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,257
God knows
what the rest of them are like.

751
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,162
Maybe father was right.

752
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,766
Maybe it is
the end of times.

753
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:01,603
Maybe...

754
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:04,238
we're all waiting
our turn for judgment.

755
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:07,875
So how are you guys doing?

756
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,010
Okay, I guess.

757
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:13,113
If you'd like to leave,
we can escort you.

758
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,449
I guarantee
that you'll be safe.

759
00:45:16,618 --> 00:45:18,152
No, thank you.

760
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:20,254
Okay.

761
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,089
Let's go.

762
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:40,741
Sir, I have
Lieutenant Colonel Charone

763
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:43,877
-on the radio.
-Well done.

764
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,148
Colonel,
this is General Vasquez,

765
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:49,483
I hope you have
good news for me?

766
00:45:49,618 --> 00:45:50,818
Right now, General,

767
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,486
my communications
are still down.

768
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,388
I only have
a few men here.

769
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,790
Colonel, we have
a large number of hostiles

770
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,025
headed towards
that choke point.

771
00:45:58,158 --> 00:45:59,360
<i>I need your men there now.</i>

772
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,794
Understood, sir.

773
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,463
My men are proving
hard to reach.

774
00:46:02,597 --> 00:46:04,898
Then get anyone that can stand
and pull a trigger.

775
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:06,601
Most of them
are gonna want to stay

776
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:07,935
with their families, sir.

777
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,169
Tell them to bring
their families,

778
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:10,572
they'll be safer
in the camp.

779
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:13,474
Do we have the supplies
to support that, sir?

780
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:14,942
No, not at all.

781
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:15,876
But if we don't get
this area secure,

782
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,177
it won't matter.

783
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,445
Out.

784
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:53,515
hear something.

785
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:57,484
There he is. Go, now.

786
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,984
Hey, guys, come look.

787
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:05,386
Hey, let's go.

788
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,255
Wait,
I need to check the charges.

789
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:09,490
All right.

790
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:19,199
- Oh, terrific.
- It's all gone.

791
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,101
What kind of animal
eats that fast?

792
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,670
You should see the guys
in my neighborhood.

793
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:24,672
So what now, Sarge?

794
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,940
We take it,
we throw it into the river.

795
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:28,843
It's only good
for attracting flies.

796
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,010
No, no, I mean,
what the hell

797
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:32,279
do we eat now, Sarge?

798
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,716
We still got water,
we can hold out.

799
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,183
For how long?

800
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,820
-Well, a couple of days.
-Sarge, I can go out there

801
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:40,454
and get us some apples.

802
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,955
-Hey.
-Good.

803
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,525
-I got a great idea.
-What's that, Sharrock?

804
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,326
Why don't we go down
to the families and, uh,

805
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,195
take it by force
this time?

806
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:52,266
-Lin, you and I go tomorrow.
-Yes, ma'am.

807
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:53,701
Sanders,
get to cleaning this up.

808
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:55,570
Move, let's go!

809
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:02,744
Terrific.

810
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:04,579
What kind of animal
leaves a trail like this?

811
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,714
I've never seen
tracks like this before.

812
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,149
I don't know,
keep looking.

813
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:10,951
- Damn it!
- What?

814
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:13,086
Most of the charges are gone.

815
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,790
What do you mean, gone?
Did they fall off?

816
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:17,090
They were secure.

817
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:18,492
If the bridge
is still here,

818
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,160
the charges
should still be here.

819
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,931
It knows what it's doing.

820
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:25,199
-What have you got left?
-One set.

821
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,000
Okay, get it off
and up top.

822
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,570
That won't bring
the bridge down.

823
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:31,071
I don't care.
Need eyes on it at all times.

824
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,574
It will at least
blow the pilings.

825
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:33,942
Oh, okay, where then?

826
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:36,210
Okay, see that sand bag?
Go, right there.

827
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,011
<i>Jävla helvetes!</i>

828
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,682
Hold it!
Keep the cans.

829
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:42,884
I want them filled
with stones and hung by wire

830
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,218
-underneath the bridge.
-Yes, ma'am.

831
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:45,620
A bit old school,
ain't it, Sarge?

832
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:47,321
We do everything we can
to stay safe.

833
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:48,890
Well, why don't we just
blow the damn bridge

834
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:50,324
and get the hell
outta here?

835
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:52,125
I told you,
this mission's vital.

836
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:53,427
People's lives
are at stake.

837
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,095
Well,
I'm not so convinced.

838
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:56,865
It's not my job
to convince you, Sharrock.

839
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,131
It's to just
give you orders.

840
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:00,067
Yeah, orders.

841
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,102
Go, stones, now.

842
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:03,638
-You, too.
-Yes, ma'am.

843
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:30,397
It's just me, kid.

844
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:33,701
What you got?

845
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:36,403
I heard something.
I think it was that thing.

846
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:38,205
Well, maybe.

847
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,274
Look, kid,
I'm no Harvard scholar,

848
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:41,643
but I know
when I'm being played.

849
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:43,043
And right now,

850
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:44,579
we're being played.

851
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:47,649
Get what you gotta get,
and let's get outta here.

852
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,200
Looking kinda hungry,
Sarge.

853
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,469
Thinking about
going back to that camp?

854
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:12,540
If we go in,
we have to go in hard.

855
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:14,174
They won't just give it up.

856
00:51:14,642 --> 00:51:17,277
Roger that,
but there may be casualties.

857
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:19,647
Unfortunately.

858
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:22,349
We gotta do
what we have to do.

859
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:37,632
You ain't coming here.

860
00:51:37,765 --> 00:51:39,734
Big Jim!

861
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:41,035
Empty.

862
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:42,837
They're here to kill us.

863
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:49,309
You aim those guns,

864
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,778
you better be prepared
to use them.

865
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:52,479
That guy carrying
the shotgun was just

866
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:54,448
- carrying it for show.
- Hmm.

867
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:56,350
-I don't think they have shit.
-You don't wanna find out.

868
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,953
You've got the mag, tough guy.
Show us what you got.

869
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,355
It must've been
a rough road getting here.

870
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:02,890
Must've had to shoot
a lot of people.

871
00:52:03,024 --> 00:52:04,358
Yeah.

872
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:05,994
Got no problem
shooting more.

873
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:07,729
Drop it.

874
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,799
Okay, boys.
Put 'em down.

875
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:14,234
On the ground.

876
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:16,571
Go. Ground.

877
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:25,647
It's not even loaded.

878
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:35,288
All clear, Sergeant.

879
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,593
So what do you want?

880
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,030
Any supplies that you have.

881
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:43,798
They're coming with us.

882
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:46,100
Yeah, and you're just gonna
leave us here to starve, right?

883
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,102
Staying here
with no weapons...

884
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:51,806
I figure you got
about a day or two at most.

885
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:58,780
Get out!

886
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,748
Hurry up!

887
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:05,687
Oh, hell.

888
00:53:06,954 --> 00:53:08,188
I heard about you.

889
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,223
They said you was fine,
girl, but...

890
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,325
you don't smell so good.

891
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,629
What do you expect?

892
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:16,531
We're running low
on water.

893
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,132
Well, maybe
that's where I can help you.

894
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,601
We've got plenty of water
down by the river.

895
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:23,571
You wanna go?

896
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:26,574
-No, I'm okay.
-You sure?

897
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,943
Hey, you know,
you can just leave her alone.

898
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:30,044
Well, shit.

899
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:31,813
Two of y'all.

900
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,817
You gotta hygiene problem,
woman.

901
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,552
You don't smell
too fine yourself.

902
00:53:37,685 --> 00:53:39,854
-Excuse me?
-Hey, Sharrock, knock it off.

903
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,489
Came here
for supplies only.

904
00:53:42,623 --> 00:53:44,692
-Let's go.
-That is supplies, brother.

905
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,231
What did they want?

906
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:53,000
Our food.

907
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:55,169
Look, right now, everybody,
we're all out for ourselves.

908
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:58,106
If you give it to them,
they're just gonna leave you.

909
00:53:58,238 --> 00:53:59,540
They're gonna drop you flat.

910
00:54:00,273 --> 00:54:01,909
So what are we going to do?

911
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,245
Stick with family,
all right?

912
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:06,647
Shit, she's coming.

913
00:54:09,183 --> 00:54:10,450
Smells like cooking.

914
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:12,553
So, is this
the camp's kitchen?

915
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,822
When we had food,
it was.

916
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:17,125
You can't go in there.

917
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,458
Yeah, you think
you can stop me?

918
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:20,895
If you didn't have
that gun, yeah.

919
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,463
Look, I grew up
with little boys like you

920
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:25,666
getting all tough
and pushing around girls.

921
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,070
I'm sorry,
you've been misinformed.

922
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,706
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

923
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:33,908
Move.

924
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:46,419
You believe us now?

925
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:48,288
You've got something
somewhere.

926
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,657
No, we haven't.

927
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,291
It doesn't look like
you're starving.

928
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:55,096
Shit.

929
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:02,003
No, it's okay.

930
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:04,005
He's just sick.

931
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,207
He looks infected to me.

932
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:08,408
It's the fucking flu
or something.

933
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,011
You checked him for bites?

934
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:12,780
No, I haven't checked him.
Check him yourself.

935
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:14,949
Sarge,
that's not a good idea.

936
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,518
I know.
Look, if he dies, he'll turn.

937
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:18,820
He'll bring
all of you down.

938
00:55:18,953 --> 00:55:21,589
No, I'll be fine.

939
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:23,224
Deal with this.

940
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,625
If anything goes wrong,
this is on you.

941
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:33,668
So, that means

942
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,303
I want everybody
on half rations.

943
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:36,804
Sanders, Lin, listen up.

944
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:39,807
Half rations,
no full apples anymore.

945
00:55:40,675 --> 00:55:42,310
Also,
I want charges checked

946
00:55:42,442 --> 00:55:44,245
so make sure that
you check with Eckland,

947
00:55:44,377 --> 00:55:45,947
I want everything intact.

948
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:47,648
-Sanders?
-Yeah.

949
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:49,382
You'll be first
going down to the river,

950
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:51,853
collect water, bathe,
do what you need to do.

951
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:54,255
-We'll take turns doing that.
-Okay.

952
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:58,159
And then on duty tonight,
Sharrock, it's you.

953
00:55:58,292 --> 00:55:59,560
Okay.

954
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:10,805
Go, go, go!

955
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,540
Go!

956
00:56:16,577 --> 00:56:17,979
-They're coming!

957
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:20,147
Evacuate the bridge.
Get ready to blow it!

958
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:22,617
Move! Go!
Go, go, go!

959
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:25,853
-Come on, bitches.
-It's not working.

960
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:28,890
, it's two!

961
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:31,893
Everyone,
every single shot counts.

962
00:56:55,683 --> 00:56:57,318
I'm out, I'm out!

963
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,451
Shit.

964
00:56:58,586 --> 00:56:59,954
Sharrock's got this.

965
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,666
-Nice shooting, Lin.
-Nice job.

966
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:13,968
Although, that leaves us
pretty low on ammo.

967
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,704
So Lin's out.
What about the rest of you?

968
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,438
One in the breech, Sarge.

969
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:21,309
Okay, copy.
Sharrock, ammunition report?

970
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,210
Me too,
one in the chamber.

971
00:57:23,344 --> 00:57:24,712
-Okay.
-How about you?

972
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:26,981
-I got enough.
-What does that mean?

973
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:29,717
-You gonna share?
-Not right now.

974
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,018
They're staying here
with me.

975
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:32,653
Oh, come on, Sarge,

976
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:34,388
wouldn't it make more sense
if we all had ammo?

977
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:36,290
In case we get
a surprise attack?

978
00:57:36,424 --> 00:57:38,458
They're staying right here.

979
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:49,971
Hey, Sanders...

980
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:52,440
do you think
we should let Sarge,

981
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:53,908
uh, torch the Humvees?

982
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,343
No, no.

983
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,979
Hey, look,
you did good back there, kid.

984
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,814
-Pretty good shooting.
-Thanks.

985
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:01,949
-But what now?
-Well, who knows?

986
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,751
Everybody
just keep on walking

987
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:05,485
and get
the hell outta here, huh?

988
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,757
So what happened
with the charge?

989
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:12,560
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

990
00:58:12,693 --> 00:58:14,195
No,
it could be the cable,

991
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:15,596
it could be the detonator.

992
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,398
-Shit.
-They're all...

993
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:19,767
Right. Okay.

994
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:23,204
Here's what
I want you to do.

995
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:24,839
I want you to cut off
the best piece of cable

996
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:26,374
and rig it
straight to the detonator.

997
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:27,541
But...

998
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:30,544
that would mean
you would go up with it, too.

999
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:33,814
It might not come to that.

1000
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:36,917
Do it!

1001
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:16,690
Eckland!

1002
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:18,859
Oh, shit, it's got him.

1003
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:23,597
-You three, guard the bridge.
-Wait, what?

1004
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,232
Sarge,
you don't want to do this.

1005
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:27,401
He has the last detonator.
He's under my command.

1006
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:29,136
I will do the same
for any of you.

1007
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,805
If he's still alive
when you get there,

1008
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:32,373
-he won't be worth saving.
-I'm doing this.

1009
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:33,674
Sarge, we've only got
two rounds left here.

1010
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:34,909
-Take my gun...
-No!

1011
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,644
...and take my ammo,
stop it.

1012
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:38,112
- I'm going.
- This is a bad idea.

1013
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:39,947
-Sarge, no!
-Yes, yes! Out of my way.

1014
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:41,415
Sarge!

1015
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:47,321
He's definitely
on his way out.

1016
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:49,524
What are we gonna do?

1017
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:51,225
You know
what's gonna happen

1018
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:53,427
-if he dies, right?
-Want me to take care of him?

1019
00:59:54,161 --> 00:59:56,864
Won't do it here.
Take him out to the woods.

1020
00:59:56,997 --> 00:59:58,833
Yeah, just leave him
out in the woods.

1021
00:59:58,966 --> 01:00:01,001
Snap his neck.
Bury him real deep.

1022
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,537
What are you,
a serial killer?

1023
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,706
I just work in an abattoir.
You get used to it.

1024
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:07,942
What is this making us?

1025
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:09,910
It's making us survivors.

1026
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,638
- Oh, my God!
- Just go!

1027
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,079
Man, I don't know
about y'all,

1028
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:53,881
but we need to
get the fuck outta here.

1029
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,183
I hate to say it,
but I think he's right.

1030
01:01:57,084 --> 01:01:58,352
But what about Sarge?

1031
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:00,454
Well,
she ain't coming back, kid.

1032
01:02:00,589 --> 01:02:01,956
You saw
what that thing can do.

1033
01:03:03,752 --> 01:03:05,052
Get back,
you son of a bitch.

1034
01:03:05,185 --> 01:03:06,420
No!

1035
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:15,429
No!

1036
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:24,666
They're in trouble,
we've gotta go help them.

1037
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,333
Man, fuck that, Lin.

1038
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:28,969
By the time we get over there,
they'll be fucking dead.

1039
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:31,972
Sanders, please.

1040
01:04:33,006 --> 01:04:34,174
No.

1041
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,876
All right,
come on, let's go.

1042
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:37,044
Oh, hell no,
I ain't dying for your bad.

1043
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:40,582
Come on, guys.

1044
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:43,384
Hey, hey!
Hey, guys, knock it off.

1045
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:46,053
- Motherfucker!
- Come here!

1046
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:49,557
We're on the same team,
knock it off.

1047
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:54,228
Sharrock, enough!

1048
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,100
Knock it off!

1049
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:03,237
-You outta control, man.
-Oh, yeah?

1050
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:06,907
Oh, you want to do
, huh?

1051
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:10,444
You wanna die?

1052
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:20,755
Come on,
you sons of bitches!

1053
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:39,273
Oh, my God,
it's Peter Ryan.

1054
01:05:39,406 --> 01:05:40,974
Oh, no,
they've got Peter.

1055
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:42,844
Peter! Peter!

1056
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:44,411
No! Peter.

1057
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:50,984
Fuck.

1058
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:52,386
Fuck!

1059
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:56,791
- I'm sorry, man.
- Sorry?

1060
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:58,058
-I'm sorry, man.
-You stabbed me.

1061
01:05:58,192 --> 01:05:59,527
-I'm sorry.
-What the fuck--

1062
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:00,762
I didn't mean that.

1063
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:01,962
What did you fucking do,
man?

1064
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,331
He was outta control, man,
I didn't mean it.

1065
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,901
-Fuck you, Sanders!
-I didn't mean it.

1066
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,368
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

1067
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,270
I'm sorry.

1068
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:18,045
Fuck.

1069
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:21,081
No, no, no.

1070
01:06:22,182 --> 01:06:23,585
It's on me.

1071
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:39,934
Sorry, brother.

1072
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:41,068
No!

1073
01:07:40,093 --> 01:07:41,161
Oh, shit!

1074
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,315
This ends now!

1075
01:08:33,313 --> 01:08:34,616
Thank God you arrived.

1076
01:08:34,749 --> 01:08:36,183
I thought
we were going to die.

1077
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:37,986
We're still
not out of the woods yet.

1078
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,319
Oh.

1079
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:40,788
Where are the keys?

1080
01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:42,557
Oh, no.

1081
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:44,826
My dad has them.

1082
01:08:45,994 --> 01:08:47,662
Oh, crap.

1083
01:09:34,274 --> 01:09:35,943
-Thanks, kid.
-Yeah, no problem.

1084
01:09:42,215 --> 01:09:43,551
Got 'em, let's go!

Stop the car!

1096
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,379
Sanders, stop! It's Sarge.

1097
01:10:55,957 --> 01:10:57,225
Sarge,
where have you been?

1098
01:10:57,357 --> 01:10:59,627
Just drive.

1099
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:00,828
Go!

1100
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:09,904
Stop.

1101
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:11,271
Stop the car!

1102
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,474
You need to let me off
at the bridge.

1103
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:15,777
I need to detonate it.

1104
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,344
Sarge, you'll die.

1105
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:20,047
Look at me.
Look at me, Lin!

1106
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:21,816
I have to do this.

1107
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,317
Did you really think
I'd survive this?

1108
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:27,822
Go. Go.

1109
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:33,060
Go!

1110
01:11:54,749 --> 01:11:56,551
Oh, my God.
What happened?

1111
01:11:57,185 --> 01:11:58,451
Go! Go!

1112
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,021
Go around.

1113
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:01,388
I'm stuck!

1114
01:12:03,191 --> 01:12:04,457
It's over.

1115
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,830
We can't go anywhere.

1116
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:49,737
No! No!

1117
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:52,573
What?

1118
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:57,578
Oh, my God!

1119
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:03,416
Oh, my God!
Help! Help!

1120
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:05,086
- No! No!
- Oh, my God!

1121
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,457
Go!

1122
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:15,897
There's nothing I can do!

1123
01:13:46,827 --> 01:13:48,329
Sir, we've got
some live ones!

1124
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:49,496
Take 'em down!

1125
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,932
Yes, sir!

1126
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:05,746
Check our tail.

1127
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:07,982
Come on, go!

1128
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:09,617
Go! Go!

1129
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,519
Come on, watch your step,
it's a long way down.

1130
01:14:11,652 --> 01:14:13,187
Here you go, you're good.
Go, go, go!

1131
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,522
Come on, buddy,
you got it.

1132
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,190
Good. Come on.

1133
01:14:16,857 --> 01:14:19,093
here we go.

1134
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:26,901
I wasn't really sure
they could pull this off, sir.

1135
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:28,468
If the goal
is big enough,

1136
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:29,637
a calculated risk
is acceptable.

1137
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:31,839
Did you really think
they were gonna do it?

1138
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:33,473
I figured
they had a chance.

1139
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:35,076
Well, you take
enough calculated risk,

1140
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:37,477
you have enough success
to make it worthwhile.

1141
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:39,479
-Isn't that right?
-Indeed.

1142
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:41,082
All right, here we go.
Watch your step.

1143
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:44,118
Ma'am, were you bitten?

1144
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:45,786
No, he didn't get me

1145
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,455
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

1146
01:14:47,588 --> 01:14:49,090
Oh, my God, but I thought
I was gonna die.

1147
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,791
All right, Craig,
let's take care of this lady.

1148
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:52,460
Make sure
she's checked out by the doc.

1149
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:53,961
Yes, sir.
You come with me, ma'am.

1150
01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:55,296
It's gonna be all right,
ma'am.

1151
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:57,031
Shit.

1152
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:03,971
Sir,
it's good to see you.

1153
01:15:04,105 --> 01:15:05,473
Good to see you made it,
what of the rest?

1154
01:15:05,606 --> 01:15:07,742
Eckland, nobody knows.

1155
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:09,477
He's presumed dead.

1156
01:15:22,623 --> 01:15:24,291
Looks like
you've still got it, Major.

1157
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:26,260
It would appear so, sir.

1158
01:15:27,128 --> 01:15:28,596
Sir, Lieutenant Jenkins
reporting, sir.

1159
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:30,097
Sir, we just found out

1160
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:31,899
the civilians were
from a camp up ahead.

1161
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,434
Would you like us to scout
ahead for any survivors?

1162
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:34,468
Negative,
just secure the bridge.

1163
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:35,870
Copy.

1164
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:37,571
Sir,
there could still be hostiles.

1165
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:38,839
Do you want us

1166
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:40,274
to scout it out,
hunt 'em down?

1167
01:15:40,408 --> 01:15:41,642
No need,
they'll come to us.

1168
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:46,480
Got it.

1169
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:48,049
Watch out
for that one right there.

1170
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:50,851
-Doug!
-Yes, Colonel!

1171
01:15:50,985 --> 01:15:52,420
Check out
this woman in green.

1172
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,789
She's showing
signs of infection,

1173
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,457
she needs to be quarantined.

1174
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,733
Get away.

1175
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:07,802
Get away from her.
It's too late.

1176
01:16:07,935 --> 01:16:09,870
Listen to me!
It's too late!

1177
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:11,472
-No! No!
-Come on, go!

1178
01:16:11,605 --> 01:16:13,508
Let's go.
Listen to me.

1179
01:16:14,008 --> 01:16:15,476
Get her off the bridge!

1180
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:16,710
Get her off
the goddamned bridge!

1181
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:20,815
Colonel, the next time
you kill one of these things,

1182
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:22,650
do it so their heads
don't explode.

1183
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:24,118
Now we have
vaporized blood in the air,

1184
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,287
and we could all
get infected!

1185
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:29,156
-Nakamura!
-Yes, sir.

1186
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:31,692
Clear this goddamn bridge.

1187
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:39,366
At least something
went right about her.

1188
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:41,135
Sir.

1189
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:44,738
What about Hernandez?

1190
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:10,998
I'm turning.

1191
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,369
General,
we've got one of yours, sir.

1192
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:25,779
I'm turning.

1193
01:17:26,447 --> 01:17:28,415
You gotta
take care of this, General.

1194
01:17:29,518 --> 01:17:30,885
Not yet.

1195
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:33,320
She needs to know.

1196
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,897
Sergeant...

1197
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:45,699
you achieved your mission.

1198
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:49,236
You should be proud.

1199
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:00,080
You won't be forgotten.

1200
01:18:00,714 --> 01:18:02,082
So many were lost.

1201
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:08,756
But so many will survive now.

1202
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:12,760
Because of you,
they will.

1203
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:19,333
General...

1204
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:21,335
please,

1205
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:23,304
take me out of my misery.

1206
01:18:24,506 --> 01:18:25,973
Please, General.

1207
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:37,985
Please.

1208
01:18:39,486 --> 01:18:40,821
Please.

1209
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:57,438
What now, sir?

1210
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:01,543
Now we secure the bridge.

1211
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:04,745
And later, we're gonna
take back this country.

1212
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:32,373
