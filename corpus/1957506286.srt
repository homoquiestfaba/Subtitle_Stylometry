00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,759
- Hello?
- Donna, Donna.

9
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:21,181
Are you awake?
- Yes, Dennis, I'm awake.

10
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,325
- [Dennis] This is what I want.

11
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,992
Have you got cube steak?
- Mm-hm.

12
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,109
Cube steak.

13
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,364
Mm-hm, what else?

14
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,819
- [Dennis] You're gonna wear
that black dress, right?

15
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:36,652
- Right.

16
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:39,319

00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,885
(dramatic music)

20
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,240
Dennis!

21
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,073
Dennis!

22
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,624
Dennis!

23
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,912
God.

24
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,943
It seemed impossible that he could die.

25
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,810
When I saw him lying in the driveway,

26
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,980
all I could think about
was how cold he must be.

27
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,163
How angry he would be when he got up.

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,490
Then I thought about
you upstairs in bed and

29
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,203
I asked myself, how am I gonna tell Denny?

30
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,920
- I've read everything about the murder,

31
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,640
I've talked to people who knew Dad.

32
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,690
I think I understand what happened there.

33
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:55,003
- But do you understand why?

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,443
- I don't think I'll ever understand why.

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,860
Did you ever love him?

36
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,353
- Yes.

37
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,063
I loved him very much.

38
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:12,063

41
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,390
- So, have you picked one yet?
- Not yet.

42
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,403
- That's it, I'm doing it.

43
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:38,740
Oh.

44
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,690
How about this one?

45
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,130
- Too sexy.

46
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,940
- Oh, I get it, you're gonna
dazzle him with your intellect.

47
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,910
- Oh, I'm not gonna dazzle
him at all, in fact,

48
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,920
I don't even know why I'm
going out with this guy.

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,813
Cops aren't my type.
- Well, he's not just a cop.

50
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:55,770
He's a narc.

51
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,047
- A narc?

52
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,607
You set me up with narc?
- (chuckles) Oh, calm down!

53
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,950
- Look, just call him
and tell him I'm sick,

54
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,500
or I've gone back to
California, that's it.

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Call him and tell him I'm sick,

56
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,980
and I've gone back to California.

57
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,680
- Just have a good time,
you're on vacation!

58
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
- Why don't we just blow this
guy off and go to a movie?

59
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,280
(doorbell rings)

60
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,113
- That's gotta be him.

61
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:19,570
- It can't be, he's early!

62
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,279
- Maybe he can't tell time,
he used to be a weightlifter.

63
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,362
- A weight...

64
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:29,152
(sighs)

65
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:32,450
- [Dennis] If she doesn't like
me maybe you let me take you.

66
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,230
- Donna, this is Dennis.

67
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,880
Dennis, this is my sister, Donna.

68
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,543
- Hi, Donna.

69
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,143
- Hi.

70
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,970
- [Dennis] So, how do you
like living in California?

71
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,420
- It's great.

72
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,123
- You ever miss Pueblo?
- Not really, just my sister.

73
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:53,960
- Yeah, family's important.
- Do you have family here?

74
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,040
- Yeah, I sure do, I got a
step-daughter and a wife.

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,603
She died a year ago.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,930
- I'm sorry.

77
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,697
- Well, when you lose
somebody you love, you,

78
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,870
you realize what's
important in life, you know,

79
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,910
family and friends, building
a future and doing something

80
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,730
that gives you a sense
of satisfaction, pride.

81
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,563
Ah, here we are.

82
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:14,431
- Okay.

83
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,883
- So, Saturday night, we drive back.

84
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,280
Well, well, well, yabba dabba do.

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
- Stay cool, Jerry.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
- Guys, I'd like you to meet Donna.

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,300
Donna, this is Mike and Jerry.

88
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,070
- Hey, Donna.
- Hello, gentlemen.

89
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,080
- Gentlemen, you got the wrong
guys, we work with Dennis.

90
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,600
- Don't let him scare
ya, Donna, he means well.

91
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,560
- Donna, would you like
something to drink?

92
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,960
- Cola's fine.

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,250
- You don't drink?

94
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,760
- Not much.

95
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,570
Is that okay?
- Well, it's fine.

96
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,440
I don't, either.

97
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,853
Freddy, two colas, please.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,920
Cherry?
- Okay.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,753
- I'll say.

100
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,820
- Hey, Dennis.

101
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,300
Telephone.

102
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,810
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.

103
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,130
- We'll keep an eye on her for ya, Dennis.

104
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,000
- [Dennis] Yeah, don't strain yourself.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,550
- Dennis was a clever bastard.
- What do you mean?

106
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,757
- Well, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

107
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:08,660
but Dennis has this prearranged signal.

108
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,390
- What kind of prearranged signal?

109
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,800
- Well, if he thinks it might
be time to cut a date loose,

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,110
he'll have a police call come in.

111
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,980
- Oh, I see.

112
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,720
- Now, why would he wanna cut her loose?

113
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,160
- Hey, don't tell him I said anything.

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,083
I'll drive you home
when you're ready to go.

115
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:28,583
- Gee, Jerry, that sounds thrilling.

116
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,080
- [Dennis] This is my
favorite time of the day.

117
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,273
- You don't have to go back to work?

118
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:39,521
- No.

119
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:40,793
Why?

120
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,620
Oh.
- (chuckles) Just wondered.

121
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,770
- Jerry said somethin'.

122
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,103
- I guess...
- Jerry talks too much.

123
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,550
- Is everything about looks with you?

124
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,560
- No, no, there's a lot
of things to consider.

125
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,728
Intelligence, good values, charm.

126
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,136
But you gotta start somewhere.

127
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,520
- You're too much.

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,020
- Thank you.

129
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,863
Hey, you wanna see my house?

130
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,464
It's a real log cabin.

131
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:10,810
(Donna laughs)

132
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,060
- It's our first date.
- Oh, come on!

133
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,310
I'm harmless, I just
wanna show you my house.

134
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,010
- Okay, why not?

135
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,313
- [Dennis] Good, good.

136
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,010
- I can't believe how peaceful
this is, if I lived here,

137
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,740
I'd sit in that swing every single night

138
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,333
and watch the stars twinkle.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
- Yeah, I spend a lot of
time doing that myself.

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,620
Come on, let me show you the house.

141
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,358
Right in here, this is
the, well, this is the...

142
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:42,667
- Kitchen. (laughs)
- Kitchen, yeah.

143
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,100
- Oh, you built this all by yourself?

144
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,550
- I sure did, with my own two hands.

145
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,950
Would you like something to drink?

146
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,290
I don't have much, I've got
juice and I've got soft drink.

147
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,437
Cola, is that okay?
- Cola's fine.

148
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,637
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

149
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,860
Who's that?

150
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,650
- Oh, that's Patty,
that's my step-daughter.

151
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,190
She's staying with some
relatives right now

152
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,783
until I find someone to
help me take care of her.

153
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,553
- Her mother?

154
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,300
- [Dennis] Yeah, that's, that was Barbra.

155
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,760
- [Donna] Beautiful.

156
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,593
- Yeah, she was.

157
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,393
Here.

158
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,183
- Thank you.

159
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,320
Big house.

160
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,910
- [Dennis] Well, I'ma big guy.

161
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,763
- I'm impressed.

162
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,290
- [Dennis] With me or the house?

163
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,180
- I'll let you know.

164
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,130
You won all these?

165
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,230
- [Dennis] I sure did.

166
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,760
- That's you?

167
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,450
- Well, it's been a while.

168
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,713
I mean, I don't get much
chance to work out anymore.

169
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,580
- How much weight have you got there?

170
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,400
- Oh, this is about three.

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,233
- [Donna] Three?

172
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,255
- 300 pounds.

173
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,088
- Ah.

174
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,306
(Dennis grunts)

175
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,023
Wow.

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,480
- You ever, uh, trained, lifted weights?

177
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,470
- Me?

178
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,980
Ah-ah, I'm more of the ping-pong type.

179
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,490
- Oh, no, you've got the body,

180
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,763
the frame to pump some serious iron.

181
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,713
You wanna try it?
- Get outta here.

182
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,550
- I'll make it easy on ya.

183
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,383
Come on.

184
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,750
- Okay!

185
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,078
I'll give it a try.
- That a girl.

186
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:43,973
No, no, no, no, like me, lay down.

187
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,150
All right, grab the bar.

188
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,983
- Don't let go.

189
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,233
- I won't let go.

190
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,393
- Now what? Oh.

191
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,440
- How's that feel?

192
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,693
- Cold, (chuckles) hard.

193
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,300
- Now, don't tense.

194
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,500
Don't tense, it's the rhythm, remember.

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,100
- Right.
- Up.

196
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,285
(warm music)

197
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:11,118
- Down.

198
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:12,830
- Up.

199
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:15,227
- Down.

200
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,685
Up.

201
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:19,518
- Down.

202
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,902
Very good.

203
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,787
- I think I've had enough.

204
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,503
- Okay.

205
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,700
(weights clink)

206
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,660
Oh, wait, don't get up too quick.

207
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,490
You just lifted a lot of
weight, let me help you.

208
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,450
Well, that was good, see?

209
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,372
Told you you could do it.

210
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,205
- Yeah.

211
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,710
(laughs)

212
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,220
There's something about Dennis.

213
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,210
- [Sister] Good something
or a bad something?

214
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,710
- Oh, there's something
very sweet about him.

215
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,473
He's got this primitive,
sexy, dangerous quality.

216
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,924
We went to his house.

217
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,210
- On the first date?

218
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,840
- Don't worry, we didn't do anything.

219
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,530
I was tempted, though.

220
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,700
- You're nuts about him.

221
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,880
- Don't be ridiculous, we just met!

222
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,124
- I see it, I know, end of subject.

223
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:16,885
- [Donna] Oh, stop.

224
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,453
- Here comes the bride!
- Susie, stop.

225
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,367
(yelps)

226
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,665
- [Susie] What's this?

227
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:29,980
- [Donna] I don't know.

228
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,603
- Hi.
(women chuckle)

229
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:38,728
- Oh, thank you.
- Here you go.

230
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:41,031
- (laughs) Oh, it's for you!
- What?

231
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:42,617
- Sign here, please?
- You're kidding.

232
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:45,397
"Please come to dinner and
meet Patty tomorrow evening.

233
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,877
"Warm regards, Dennis!"

234
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,193
Oh, they're beautiful!

235
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,483
So, what are your favorite
subjects in school?

236
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,160
- Science.

237
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,895
My teacher, Mr. Mulvayne, he's kinda...

238
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:11,090
- Oh, no, Mr. Mulvayne is still there?

239
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,330
He was my teacher.

240
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,540
- Really?
- Huh.

241
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,920
- He's gotta be 100 years old.

242
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,630
He's probably injecting formaldehyde

243
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,327
in his arteries or something.

244
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,994
(Dennis laughs)

245
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,403
This is really good!

246
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,140
I can't believe you made this.

247
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,711
When I was your age,
I couldn't make jello!

248
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:30,830
(chuckles)

249
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,193
- It's my mom's recipe.

250
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,240
- She must've been a terrific cook.

251
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,103
- She was, yeah.

252
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,162
(mumbles) Excuse me.

253
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,750
- I'll check on her.

254
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,693
- Thank you.

255
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,190
- [Donna] You wanna talk?

256
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,043
- [Patty] I can't.

257
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,120
- Well, maybe I can sit
with you for a little while.

258
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,920
- I just miss her so much.

259
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,423
It's not fair that she died.

260
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,583
- I know.

261
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,488
- She was my best friend, too.

262
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,390
When she said bye to me that
day, it was Valentine's day

263
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,853
and she looked so sad.

264
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,477
She said something like, (chuckles)

265
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:45,997
"every time I say goodbye,

266
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:48,547
"I feel like it's the last
time I'll ever see you."

267
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:54,270
And, (sobs) I was so mad
at her 'cause I had on

268
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,590
this pretty new dress
that I was gonna wear

269
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,770
to the afterschool Valentine's dance

270
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,053
and all I could think about was the dance.

271
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,563
So mad at her, I wouldn't
even kiss her goodbye.

272
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,420
And then a couple hours later,

273
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,670
they called me out of history class,

274
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,053
and Dennis was waiting in
the Principal's office.

275
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:23,870
And he told me that she
had an allergic reaction

276
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,643
to her medication and died. (sobs)

277
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:31,470
My mom.

278
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:36,090
(door creaks)

279
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,760
- [Dennis] Is she all right?

280
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,653
- She's fine.

281
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,053
- Thank you.

282
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,720
- It's not an easy age for a girl.

283
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,200
It's tough for you, isn't it?

284
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,263
Being there for her, with your work.

285
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,220
- Especially with her mother gone.

286
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:00,586
I was wondering,

287
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:03,870
what're your immediate
plans for the future?

288
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,303
I mean, what're you gonna do?

289
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,560
- Oh, well, I don't know.

290
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,853
I'm probably gonna go back
to California, San Francisco.

291
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,123
Find work, maybe go back to school.

292
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,040
- What do you think about staying here

293
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,290
and taking care of Patty?

294
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,470
- Dennis, (chuckles) we just met.

295
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,990
- No, wait a minute, hear me out.

296
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,963
It would strictly be a business
arrangement and that's all.

297
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,803
I saw you two together tonight, Donna.

298
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,820
I mean, (chuckles) you'd be great for her.

299
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,780
You can give her something
that I can't give her.

300
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,480
- Dennis, that's a big commitment.

301
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,193
- But she seems to really like you.

302
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,640
- I couldn't say no.
(warm music)

303
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,240
Maybe it was because of Patty,

304
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,940
or maybe it was because I
didn't wanna leave Colorado.

305
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,980
Or maybe it was because I
was falling in love with him.

306
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,833
All that mattered was that I
seemed to belong in that house.

307
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,560
By the end of the summer, I was
hopelessly in love with him.

308
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,143
(both chuckle)

309
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,113
What is it?
- I don't know.

310
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:51,377
There's something beneath the bed.

311
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:52,281
- Ah.

312
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,321
- What's that?
- I don't know, what is this?

313
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:57,729
- I don't know, what is this?
(Donna giggles)

314
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:58,812
- Oh, Dennis.

315
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,777
I don't know what to say.

316
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:05,523
- It was my grandmother's.

317
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Say you'll marry me.

318
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,147
- I'll marry you.

319
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:26,663
(background chatter)

320
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,790
- Dennis.
- Hey, how you doin'?

321
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,090
- Hey, good to see you, Denny.
- How are you?

322
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:39,913
- (chuckles) Well, look
what the cat drug in!

323
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,323
Where you been, Dennis?

324
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,130
- Catchin' drug dealers, gettin' engaged.

325
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,980
- Engaged!
- Huh, can you believe it?

326
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,447
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

327
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:51,575
- [Friend] Who's the chick?

328
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:52,919
- Here, let me show you a picture.

329
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,775
- Yeah, let me see.

330
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,390
- Look at that.
- Oh yeah, man, she's pretty.

331
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,450
- Huh, she's beautiful, isn't she?

332
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,110
- Yeah, you'd be beauty
and the beast. (chuckles)

333
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,260
Hey, you been training lately?

334
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,400
- Yeah, why, can't you tell?

335
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,200
- Looks like you're shrinking to me.

336
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:13,782
(Dennis sighs)

337
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:15,960
- It's definitely not you.
- I know.

338
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,134
- Here, try this on.
- Okay.

339
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:19,467
Oh, no.

340
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,300
Mm-mm.

341
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,780
- It doesn't matter, you're still gonna be

342
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,303
the most beautiful bride in
the history of the world.

343
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,410
- Can you believe how
fast this is happening?

344
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,583
It seems like I just met Dennis.

345
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,657
- You act like you've known him forever.

346
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:35,213
(gasps) I almost forgot.

347
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,310
Something old.

348
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,230
- Grandma's bracelet?
- I want you to have it.

349
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,560
- Oh, Susie, I couldn't.
- I want you to have it.

350
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,780
Something old, something new.

351
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,813
Something borrowed, something blue.

352
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:08,181
(ominous music)

353
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:29,213
(weights clink)

354
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,130
(Dennis grunts)

355
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:43,396
- Dennis?

356
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:44,229
Dennis?

357
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,011
Are you okay?

358
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:49,353
- (groans) I'm fine.

359
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,563
Maybe you better sleep in the other room.

360
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:53,396
- Why?

361
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,779
Why?

362
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,453
- I don't wanna crush you.

363
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:00,070
- I don't mind staying.

364
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,823
- Please, just listen to me.

365
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,783
- I wanna, I wanna stay and cuddle.

366
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:07,873
- Just get out!

367
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,693
Please, Donna.

368
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,562
Please, just leave.

369
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,332
- Okay.

370
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:31,349
(melancholy music)

371
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:48,056
(clock ticks)

372
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:52,505
(ominous music)

373
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:01,882
(muffled clinks)

374
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:14,850
(Dennis grunts)

375
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,053
I need my pillow.

376
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:19,340
(Dennis grunts)

377
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,720
- Get out.

378
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,620
- Why are you talking to me like this?

379
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:24,463
- I said get out.

380
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,010
- What is wrong with you, Dennis?

381
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,901
- Get out!

382
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,568
(Donna screams)

383
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:45,354
(phone rings)

384
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,450
(phone rings)

385
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:53,466
(phone rings)

386
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,840
(phone rings)

387
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,050
- Let it ring.

388
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,518
- You think I wanna talk to that maniac?

389
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:03,037
Here, put this on you.

390
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,970
- I don't understand how he could be

391
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,620
so violent all of a sudden.

392
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,500
Maybe, maybe it was me, I don't...

393
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,690
- Donna, it's not you.

394
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,189
Once a man shows he's violent,
there's bound to be more.

395
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:18,092
(phone rings)
- Pick the phone up.

396
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,493
Pick the phone up.
(phone rings)

397
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:21,993
Pick the phone up.

398
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:27,815
(phone dings)

399
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,780
- [Susie] You're sure you
don't want me to call a doctor?

400
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,730
- [Donna] I'm fine.

401
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,270
- I'm going over there tomorrow,

402
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,226
and I'm gonna get your things.

403
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:44,722
- No, I don't know, I'm just...

404
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:45,555
- Donna.
- I'm not sure.

405
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:48,643
You don't deserve this, this is scary.

406
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:51,310
(brakes squeal)

407
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:54,829
(door slams)

408
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,243
- [Dennis] Donna!

409
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,243
(thuds)
Donna!

410
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:04,076
Donna!

411
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:07,303
(thuds)
Donna, open up!

412
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:11,501
(melancholy music)
Donna, please, Donna!

413
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:15,498
Donna, it's me, Dennis!

414
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,555
(thuds)
Donna!

415
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:19,811
(thuds)

416
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,403
Please, Donna!

417
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,236
Please!

418
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:26,860
Donna!

419
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:30,348
Please, Donna!

420
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:32,280
- He'll say anything to keep you.

421
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,053
If you open that door,
there's no turning back.

422
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,905
(door creaks)

423
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,390
- Donna. (pants)

424
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,400
Please. (pants)

425
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,233
Please.

426
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:50,901
- You hurt me.

427
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,822
(Dennis sobs)

428
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:57,822
- I'm sorry.

429
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:02,674
(door creaks)

430
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,107
I love you.

431
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,483
- Promise me you'll never
hurt me like that again.

432
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:13,982
- I promise you, please don't leave.

433
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,816
(sobs)

434
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:25,387
God, I love you so much.

435
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:26,887
- I love you, too.

436
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:36,470
When you love somebody as
much as I loved your father,

437
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,000
you tend to block out things

438
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,050
that might interfere with your happiness.

439
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,170
But Susie was right,
once I opened that door,

440
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,980
there was no turning back.
("Bridal Chorus")

441
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:31,603
(upbeat country music)
(background chatter)

442
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:38,106
- Hey, Donna!
- Hi, Phil.

443
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,186
Oh!

444
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:42,074
Watch your drink.

445
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:44,907
(Dennis chuckles)

446
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:55,931
(camera snaps)

447
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,026
- Toast, everybody!

448
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:58,530
- Toast, toast!

449
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,673
- To Donna and Dennis.

450
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,720
To loving, laughing and fun.

451
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,320
- And remember, Donna,

452
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,392
everything you love about
Dennis, he learned from me.

453
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:12,975
(guests laugh and applaud)

454
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,808
- Don't drink that champagne.

455
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:18,641
- Why not?

456
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,243
- Because I said so.

457
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,817
- Can I talk to you please?

458
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,370
- Why would you tell me not to drink

459
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,520
on our wedding day, or ever?

460
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,390
- You are my wife, the
wife of a police officer.

461
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,797
That means no drinking.

462
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,740
- What did you think I was gonna do,

463
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,573
get drunk and embarrass you?

464
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:49,410
- No, there are rules, you
have to follow those rules!

465
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,243
- Rules?

466
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:52,180
This is our wedding
day, we're celebrating.

467
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,320
I have one glass of
champagne and you get upset?

468
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,090
But your buddy out here, Phil,
who I've never seen sober,

469
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,150
is practically falling
on the floor, drunk.

470
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,716
- Leave Phil out of this.

471
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:02,010
- Ow!
(glass smashes)

472
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,153
- Don't talk about my friends that way.

473
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,560
- The photographer...

474
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:19,810
- (sighs) I'm sorry.

475
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,538
Okay?
(door thuds)

476
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:22,371
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:24,258
Sorry.

478
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,138
Come on.

479
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:30,721
(somber music)

480
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,467
(weights clink)

481
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,019
(grunts)

482
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,427
Watch.

483
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:33,622
The mirror.

484
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,508
(zipper scrapes)

485
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,883
(sighs)

486
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,758
(sniffs deeply)

487
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,034
God, you turn me on.

488
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,165
You don't understand how much I love you.

489
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:48,452
- I love you too, Dennis.

490
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,120
At night, I went to my
wedding bed with a man

491
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,383
I was beginning to fear
as much as I loved.

492
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,441
He wasn't the same man I
fell in love with, but,

493
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,320
I couldn't figure out what was wrong.

494
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,550
- Why did you stay?

495
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,080
- When the rages passed,

496
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,420
he went back to being the sweetest man.

497
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,653
He was Jekyll and Hyde.

498
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,970
At first I thought it was stress
related because of his work

499
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,253
or maybe he had some
psychological problem.

500
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,170
I didn't realize at the time
that it was the steroids.

501
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,600
- So, how did you find out?

502
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,943
- He was building a gym then, with Eddie.

503
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,133
- Eddie Greenwell helped
Dad build the gym?

504
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,140
- Man, when are you gonna work out, man?

505
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,220
- Well, I might let you train with me,

506
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,170
but you gotta promise
to take it seriously.

507
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,567
- Oh yeah, I will.

508
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,310
Yeah, chicks love guys with muscles.

509
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,160
You know, I gotta get me some muscles.

510
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,282
- Yeah, you gotta get you some muscles.

511
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:56,699
(horn honks)

512
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,353
- Hey, guys.

513
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:08,442
Dennis.

514
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,065
- What do you say, Steve?
(Steve chuckles)

515
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:12,340
- Glad to see you workin' out.

516
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,580
Beginning to think you
were dwindling on me.

517
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,180
- I'll show you dwindlin'!
(Steve chuckles)

518
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,063
- Well, well.

519
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,360
- Uh, Steve is my wife, Donna.

520
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,420
Donna, Steve.

521
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,060
- Hello, Steve.
- Hello, Donna.

522
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,600
- We used to work out together.

523
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,640
- Yeah.

524
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,120
So, how's it feel to
be married to a legend?

525
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,310
- Great, can I get you some lemonade?

526
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,523
- Oh, no, no thanks, I'm fine.

527
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,063
Here you go, my man.

528
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,120
- Donna, you got $50 here
for Steve for my medicine?

529
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,220
- Are you a doctor, Steve?

530
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,193
- Not exactly.

531
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,760
- Just get him the money.

532
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,680
- Dennis, we may have to wait on that.

533
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,133
About the end of the week?

534
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,410
- Oh, yeah, that's no problem, buddy.

535
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,580
I can just get it later.

536
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,630
Look, I gotta get goin', I gotta
be gettin' back to the gym.

537
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,110
I'm meeting some people back there.

538
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,970
It was nice to meet you, Donna.

539
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,920
- Nice meeting you.

540
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,112
(car engine starts)

541
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:13,695
- Get in the house.

542
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,453
- Uh, are we done here?

543
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:27,677
(lively rock music)

544
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:30,180
- Don't ever embarrass me like that again.

545
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,340
- I can't help it that
we're short on cash, Dennis.

546
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,720
You've been spending money like crazy

547
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,960
on your new gym, ordering more equipment.

548
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,640
- Look, I don't wanna hear that.

549
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,623
Now, when I ask you for money,
I want it and that's it.

550
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:48,370
Look at this glass.

551
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,710
Look at this glass,
look at the spots on it.

552
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,743
I'm not drinking out of this.

553
00:33:50,743 --> 00:33:51,855
- [Donna] It just came
out of the dishwasher.

554
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,580
- I don't care if it just
came out of the dishwasher.

555
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,180
I want you to clean it, by hand.

556
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,840
What did I just say?

557
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,730
- I heard you.

558
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,460
- No, no, no, what did I say?

559
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,363
Repeat it to me.

560
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,413
- "Wash it, by hand."

561
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,473
- Hurry, please.

562
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,651
- Was is that you're taking?

563
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:18,138
♪ What I want, I want ♪

564
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:21,563
♪ What you got, I need ♪

565
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:24,646
♪ And nothing can do ♪

566
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:34,187
- Patty, turn that music off.

567
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:35,333
- Sorry, Dennis.

568
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:38,414
- I told you not to play
that music in my house.

569
00:34:38,414 --> 00:34:39,747
- [Patty] Sorry.

570
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,693
- Oh, good.

571
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,843
I think you're starting to see
what marriage is all about.

572
00:34:58,194 --> 00:34:59,861
- It's the steroids.

573
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,773
They make him crazy.

574
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,120
- [Donna] I did some research
on metabolic steroids.

575
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,090
Read books, talked to doctors, pharmacist.

576
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,980
I wanted to know why things had changed,

577
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,619
physically and mentally.

578
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,320
He was having liver problems,
acne all over his back.

579
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,810
The worst were the rages.

580
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,800
- What's the situation?

581
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,930
- Two guys and a woman in there,

582
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,720
a lot of cocaine and a couple of guns.

583
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,553
- [Dennis] Who are they?

584
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:26,630
- Just some locals looking for rent money.

585
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,033
- Please!

586
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:36,623
- Are you okay?

587
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:37,706
- What? Yeah.

588
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:41,100
What kinda gun's he got?
- Small caliber handguns.

589
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,513
- Is that the only exit?
- Yeah.

590
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,760
- Cover me.

591
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,410
- Dennis, there's a kid in there!

592
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:56,116
(guns fire)
(woman yelps)

593
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:01,480
- [Woman] No, don't, stop it!

594
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,813
(guns fire)

595
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:17,571
(glass smashes)
(screams)

596
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:18,738
- Put it down!

597
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:22,619
Shut up!

598
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,660
Come on, put her down, tough guy!

599
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,493
Put her down!

600
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:32,292
(grunts)
(woman sobs)

601
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:35,037
(somber music)

602
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:37,537
(phone rings)

603
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:42,230
(phone rings)

604
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,063
- [Donna] Hello?

605
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,383
Yes, Dennis.

606
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,063
Pork chops, green corn.

607
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,753
Potato, mm-hm.

608
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,167
Yes, I'll um, I'll wear the dress.

609
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:00,960
- [Radio Host] It's 2:20 AM and
time now for the local news.

610
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,570
The Elks Club will be hosting
a fund-raiding barbecue

611
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,030
in Martin Field this
Saturday to help support

612
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,260
the new senior citizens
center in downtown Pueblo.

613
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,400
Tickets will be four dollars
for adults and three dollars...

614
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,233
- Don.

615
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,780
- I'm sorry.

616
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,530
- I've workin' all day,
the least thing you can do

617
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,703
is be decent company.

618
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,430
- It's just that it's so late, Dennis,

619
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,723
and I'm not feeling well.

620
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,863
- You're a hypochondriac.

621
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,690
- [Radio Host] Nor any member
of the Pueblo police force

622
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,440
would comment on his alleged
behavior on that drug bust

623
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,150
where it was reported that
Yaklich held a nine-year-old girl

624
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,410
by her ankle with a gun to
her head, the police would...

625
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,460
- Is that true?

626
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,960
You did that to a little girl?

627
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:44,197
Why?

628
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:45,900
How could you do that?

629
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,020
- Donna, I wouldn't do
somethin' like that.

630
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,313
The press hates me.

631
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,660
They don't get it, the
public doesn't get it.

632
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,244
Oh yeah, they want
protection, yeah. (chuckles)

633
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:58,070
But then they wanna question
the methods that I used

634
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,550
to provide that protection,
they don't care about cops.

635
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,070
They don't care about us layin' our lives

636
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,283
on the line every day.

637
00:38:06,044 --> 00:38:07,910
I've got a lot of enemies who
would like to see me hurt,

638
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,743
or worse.

639
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,340
You understand, don't you, Donna?

640
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,943
- No, Dennis, I don't understand.

641
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,800
- Watch your tone with me.

642
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,240
- I read about the steroids you take

643
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,200
for your weight lifting.

644
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,580
They've changed you, Dennis.

645
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,400
You're not the sweet man I married.

646
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,070
You've gotta stop taking the drugs.

647
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,150
- I don't take drugs, I
arrest people who take drugs.

648
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,350
- [Donna] They hurt you.

649
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,320
- What're you, deaf?

650
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,780
I said I didn't take drugs.

651
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,073
- They make you angry.

652
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,217
- Hey, if you don't like it, get out.

653
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:41,764
(somber music)

654
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,150
- I'm gonna have your baby.

655
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,186
(Dennis sighs)

656
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:04,019
- A baby.

657
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:07,330
Well, that's uh...

658
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,183
That's great.

659
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,360
- Don't let your enthusiasm
run away with you.

660
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,569
- No, really, I mean that, (chuckles)

661
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:16,819
you know, it's wonderful.

662
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,603
Denny Junior, that's wonderful.

663
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,123
Donna.

664
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,860
Try and understand about the steroids.

665
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,100
It's a deal that you make with yourself.

666
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,883
When I use them, I can do
things that normal men can't do.

667
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:37,120
- Dennis, no, no, I can't
keep living in fear of you.

668
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm gonna be a mother.

669
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,860
Please stop taking the steroids.

670
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,420
Be the man I fell in love with.

671
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,463
Please!

672
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:49,723
- All right, Donna.

673
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,343
- Do you promise me?

674
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,157
- I promise you.

675
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:00,833
I'll be a good husband.

676
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,457
And I'll be a good father.

677
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,620
- For a while, things
were good between us.

678
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,330
He was sweet and loving,

679
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,790
but his promise to stay off
steroids didn't last very long.

680
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,370
As he bought more and more equipment

681
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,950
for his new weight lifting room,

682
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:32,950
his urge to go back on
steroids became overpowering.

683
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,160
By the time you were born,
he spent every free moment he

684
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,412
wasn't working, in a gym, either
lifting or making weights.

685
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:42,380
- [Eddie] Come on, push it
now, baby, push it, push it!

686
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,400
Come on, man, one more!

687
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,553
Come on, keep it going now, keep it going.

688
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:48,856
Ride it, man, ride it!

689
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:49,773
Ride, ride!

690
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,133
- There you go.

691
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,600
- Ah!

692
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,493
- Say "Hi, Daddy."
- Come here.

693
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:57,533
Come here, boy.

694
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,343
You daddy's boy, huh?

695
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:01,176
Huh?

696
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:03,050
Who's boy, are you daddy's boy, aren't ya?

697
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:03,883
Look at this, Eddie.

698
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:05,300
You ever seen a more
handsome kid than this?

699
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,528
- He looks just like you, Dennis.

700
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:08,721
Except, he's got his
mother's beautiful eyes.

701
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:10,493
- Oh, man, you scared him.

702
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,690
Hey, I got somethin' for
ya, I got somethin' for ya.

703
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,680
Stay right here.

704
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:18,325
- What's he got?

705
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:24,510
(Dennis roars)

706
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,922
- You like that?

707
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:27,489
Do you like that?

708
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,210
You like that, huh?

709
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,350
- He does, I thought you
might like some dinner.

710
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,410
- No, not till we're done working out.

711
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,970
- That's mighty nice of you though, Donna.

712
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,900
- Cover him up.
- I got it.

713
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,010
- All right, you go.

714
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,797
- [Donna] See you later, Daddy.

715
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:42,873
- Bye bye, buddy!

716
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:44,921
- [Donna] Bye!

717
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:48,470
- Man, you sure are lucky
to have such a beautiful,

718
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,670
thoughtful wife, Dennis.

719
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,633
- Donna's a selfish, manipulating woman.

720
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,420
- She don't seem that way.

721
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,562
- You don't understand women.

722
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:04,310
They'll do anything they can
to try and shatter your dreams.

723
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,000
Try and make you something
that you can never be.

724
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,313
You know what I mean, huh?

725
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,793
- Yeah.

726
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:13,543
(peaceful music)

727
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:15,617
- Look.

728
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:18,250
Look, there's a wishing star.

729
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,280
Look out the window, let's make a wish.

730
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,780
Let's make a wish.

731
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,070
Star bright, star light,
first star I see tonight.

732
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,033
I wish that you'll only know
a gentle, peaceful life.

733
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,250
And that you'll never ever be scared.

734
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,345
(ominous tones)

735
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:38,762
- [Dennis] Donna.

736
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:43,386
- Just give me a few more minutes.

737
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:44,553
- Come to bed.

738
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:51,725
- It's okay.

739
00:42:57,397 --> 00:43:00,653
(Denny cries)

740
00:43:00,653 --> 00:43:02,403
- [Dennis] Come here.

741
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,249
(Denny cries)

742
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:15,821
- Dennis, I can't.
- Shh!

743
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:19,241
(Denny cries)

744
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,002
- Don't make me do this.
- Don't say anything.

745
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:27,252
Get on the bed.

746
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:31,655
- The baby's crying.
- Don't worry about the baby.

747
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:33,367
It's good for him, shut up.

748
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:34,723
- But Dennis, I...
- I said shut up!

749
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:37,699
(Donna sobs)
(Denny cries)

750
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,187
I'm sick of your whining.

751
00:43:39,187 --> 00:43:41,280
Remind me of my first wife.

752
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:45,359
(Denny cries)

753
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:49,537
(car approaches)

754
00:43:59,076 --> 00:44:00,364
(door slams)

755
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:01,864
What're you doing here, Susie?

756
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,820
- We're gonna stay with her for a while.

757
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,653
- Uh-huh.

758
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,200
Well, you can stay with
her as long as you like,

759
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,920
but the baby stays right here.

760
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,200
- I wish I knew what a pig you were

761
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,570
before I introduced you to my sister.

762
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,330
- Susie, if you knew
what was good for you,

763
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,190
you'd keep that smart mouth of yours shut.

764
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,840
- Don't you dare threaten my sister.

765
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,540
- We're leaving, Dennis,
she's got a right...

766
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,613
- She's got what rights I say she's got.

767
00:44:22,613 --> 00:44:25,090
Now, get off my property
and don't come back.

768
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,940
Or believe me, you're gonna be sorry.

769
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,402
(Denny cries)

770
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,540
- Donna, I...
- No, no, you better...

771
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,990
- Get outta here!
- You better go on, it's okay.

772
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,340
- This isn't over, Dennis.

773
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,720
- Oh, what're you gonna do, Susie Q?

774
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,770
Call the police, huh?

775
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:47,172
(chuckles)

776
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,913
Get inside.

777
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,294
- [Donna] Please, Dennis,
please don't hurt me.

778
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,127
Just leave me alone.

779
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:16,019
- You want a divorce, you want a divorce?

780
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:16,986
- I won't do it again!

781
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:19,230
- You're never gonna get my son!

782
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,800
You're never gonna get
my son, do you hear me?

783
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:24,111
Get back here!

784
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:26,639
(Donna screams)
You get back here!

785
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,559
(muffled screams)

786
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,758
You're never get him, do you hear me?

787
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:32,615
Never!

788
00:45:32,615 --> 00:45:37,615
(upbeat country music)
(background chatter)

789
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,850
- Hey, Donna, how you doin'?

790
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,303
Have a seat.

791
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,546
Coffee?

792
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:56,379
- No.

793
00:45:58,649 --> 00:46:00,110
- What can I do for you?

794
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,850
- I need your help.

795
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:02,900
- What's the problem?

796
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,100
- Please talk to Dennis for me.

797
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,290
- Dennis is actin' up, huh?

798
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,400
- Yes, he hurts me.

799
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,660
He scares me, you...

800
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,340
You've gotta make him stop!

801
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,340
- Come on, Donna.

802
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,297
Dennis just gets a little
carried away, that's all.

803
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:26,500
- No, no, he's taking
steroids, it makes him crazy.

804
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,750
I think he could kill me!

805
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:33,620
- Look, Donna, I would like
to help but it's not my place.

806
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,920
- Jerry, no, there must be somebody,

807
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,915
somebody who could do
something to help me.

808
00:46:38,915 --> 00:46:40,787
- Donna.

809
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:43,280
Donna, we just don't get involved

810
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,980
in each other's personal business.

811
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,903
You understand?

812
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,641
- Yeah, I understand.

813
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,103
Thanks.

814
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,770
(suspenseful music)

815
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:22,610
(ominous music)

816
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,610
(gasps)

817
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,390
- I understand you had a
visit with Jerry today.

818
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,483
- I just...

819
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,463
I didn't...

820
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:40,137
- You see, Donna, I
consider marriage sacred.

821
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,113
So...

822
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,520
When you do something like,

823
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,010
like talking to Jerry about
our married life, I...

824
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,563
It hurts me.

825
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,360
- I didn't mean to say
anything that would hurt you.

826
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,340
- You're probably wondering if
I'm going to crush your skull

827
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:18,340
or squeeze right here and watch
the life drain out of you.

828
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:21,340
I could do that.

829
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,116
- [Donna] No, no.

830
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:24,283
- Very easily.

831
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,993
- Dennis.

832
00:48:26,993 --> 00:48:28,443
- I wanna show you something.

833
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,643
I went to a lot of trouble so
you could see these pictures.

834
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,515
I wanted you to see them.

835
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:45,348
- No.

836
00:48:49,364 --> 00:48:50,197
- Look.

837
00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:53,412
You see it, no, don't look away.

838
00:48:53,412 --> 00:48:54,611
You look at me.

839
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:57,028
(Donna sobs)

840
00:48:58,107 --> 00:49:00,244
See that?
- Oh, God!

841
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:01,907
Oh, God!

842
00:49:01,907 --> 00:49:03,824
(sobs)

843
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:11,685
- Look here!
(Donna sobs)

844
00:49:12,189 --> 00:49:13,750
Look at that right there,
you just look there.

845
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,180
You see that?

846
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,640
That could be you, Donna.

847
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,022
That could be Susie.

848
00:49:20,022 --> 00:49:23,446
- Oh, please.

849
00:49:23,446 --> 00:49:25,446
- Anything could happen.

850
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:40,715
- No.

851
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,395
No, no.

852
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:53,771
No, please. (sobs)

853
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:04,759
Don't hurt me, please. (sobs)

854
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:11,410
Oh, no. (sobs)

855
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:14,850
- We'll be together, Donna.

856
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,450
Till death do us part, remember?

857
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:19,833
- No. (sobs)

858
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:20,666
Help me.

859
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,450
For the next five years,

860
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,550
I was a prisoner in a torture chamber.

861
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:26,603
He got crazier.

862
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,913
I lived in constant fear for my life.

863
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,170
Dennis spent all his free time in the gym.

864
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,700
Patty was a senior in high school.

865
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,693
She was dating Greg, a nice
guy who was so good to her.

866
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:57,591
They were so much in love and
they wanted to get married.

867
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,183
I never went anywhere or saw anyone.

868
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,750
From that point on, I
only had two thoughts.

869
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,583
Kill him.

870
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,623
Or kill myself.

871
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,000
And then I would think,

872
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,390
I can't leave my son without a mother.

873
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,230
Look, there's San Francisco.

874
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,810
It's a beautiful city
with a big golden bridge.

875
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,350
- Have you been there, Mommy?
- Mm-hm.

876
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,583
It's my favorite place.

877
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,760
- When are you gonna take me
to California to see the ocean?

878
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,283
- Someday, Denny.

879
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,903
- I wanna go swimming in it,
and I'll fish in it, too.

880
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,650
Promise you'll take me someday, Mommy?

881
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,422
- I promise, Denny.

882
00:51:43,422 --> 00:51:45,723
Now, let's go make some cookies, okay?

883
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,060
Come on, let's go!

884
00:51:50,326 --> 00:51:53,576
(dramatic organ music)

885
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:35,571
(somber music)

886
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:51,731
(Dennis sobs)

887
00:52:52,613 --> 00:52:54,530
(thud)

888
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:59,557
(Dennis sobs)

889
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:37,184
(Dennis grunts)

890
00:53:52,057 --> 00:53:57,057
(Dennis grunts)
(Weights clang)

891
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:21,640
- I need more chocolate chips, Mom.

892
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,590
- Denny, I bet you've been eating them.

893
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,210
Mm, these are going to be delicious.

894
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,043
- Little Dennis.

895
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,110
Come on, buddy, I got a prize for ya.

896
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,142
- What is it?
- Come on, I'll show ya.

897
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:36,886
- I'll be back in time to eat 'em, Mom.

898
00:54:36,886 --> 00:54:38,053
- Okay, honey.

899
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:49,380
- [Patty] Mom?

900
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,213
- Yes, Patty?

901
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,300
- I gotta talk to you.

902
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:54,699
- What is it?

903
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,623
- I'm pregnant.

904
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:08,756
- God, baby.

905
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,430
What're you gonna do?

906
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,853
- I can't tell Dennis.

907
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:16,538
- How can you hide it?

908
00:55:17,638 --> 00:55:18,966
- You tell him.

909
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:19,966
- Oh, Patty.

910
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:21,999
Oh, my.

911
00:55:24,414 --> 00:55:25,914
- What's goin' on?

912
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:30,323
What is it?

913
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,203
- It's Patty.

914
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,600
Please don't get upset, Dennis,

915
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,980
but I need to talk to you alone.

916
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,563
- No, tell me now, what is it?

917
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,713
- Patty...

918
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,133
She's pregnant.

919
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,050
(tense music)

920
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:11,525
(thuds)
(Dennis sobs)

921
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:16,221
(Dennis grunts)
(thuds)

922
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:18,721
(Dennis sobs)

923
00:56:19,954 --> 00:56:20,787
- Patty.

924
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:29,341
Get away from me.

925
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:34,447
- (sobs) I'm sorry, Dad.

926
00:56:34,447 --> 00:56:36,513
- How could you do this to me?

927
00:56:37,703 --> 00:56:40,563
How could you betray me like this?

928
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:44,590
You know how bad this is
gonna look for Dennis Yaklich

929
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,490
to have a knocked up
step-daughter, huh, do ya?

930
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,010
- Dennis, please.

931
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,640
Please stop.

932
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,240
- God, I can't even look at her.

933
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,880
I can't talk to her, you tell her for me!

934
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,713
You tell her!

935
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,638
- Please don't.
- God, help me find the words.

936
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:03,750
(pants)

937
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,900
Tell her she's no good.

938
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:07,445
Tell her!

939
00:57:07,445 --> 00:57:09,062
- You're no good.

940
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:10,382
You're no good.

941
00:57:10,382 --> 00:57:12,678
- You tell her she's disgusting.

942
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:14,134
- Dennis, please don't make say anything.

943
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:15,733
- This is your fault, this is your fault!

944
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,107
I put my trust in you and you
let me down, now you tell her!

945
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:20,940
You look at her in the eye

946
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,730
and tell her that she's disgusting!

947
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,210
Say, "Patty, you are disgusting!"

948
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,043
Enunciate!

949
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,462
- [Donna] Patty!

950
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:30,757
You are disgusting.

951
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:32,974
- And must leave this house at once!

952
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:37,974
Spit it!
(Donna sobs)

953
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:40,262
- You must leave this house at once.

954
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:41,095
- Forever!

955
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:44,382
(Donna sobs)

956
00:57:44,382 --> 00:57:45,215
Say it!

957
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:48,655
- Forever.

958
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:51,610
- Now, you listen to me.

959
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,993
I want her gone when I come
back, do you understand me?

960
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,478
Do ya?
- Yes!

961
00:57:58,478 --> 00:57:59,737
Yes.

962
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,214
Yes.

963
00:58:01,214 --> 00:58:03,446
I understand you.

964
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,363
(sobs)

965
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:11,883
- And I don't want my son making cookies.

966
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:18,441
(Donna and Patty sob)

967
00:58:20,654 --> 00:58:22,160
- Patty, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

968
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,523
It's not your fault.

969
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,540
- Where will you go?

970
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,063
- I'll stay at Greg's parents' house.

971
00:58:28,063 --> 00:58:30,480
- Listen, I'm gonna try
to get you some money.

972
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,547
So call me, promise me you'll call me.

973
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:33,630
- I'm scared.

974
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:36,130
- I'll be here for ya,
I promise you I will.

975
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,803
It's gonna be all right,
it's gonna be all right.

976
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,799
(suspenseful music)

977
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,820
- [Denny] Where are we going, Mommy?

978
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,733
- We're going on a little trip.

979
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:52,077
Everything's gonna be just
fine, I promise you, Denny.

980
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:55,756
(phone rings)

981
00:58:58,352 --> 00:58:59,630
(phone rings)

982
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,410
Come on, honey, let's go.

983
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:06,215
(phone rings)

984
00:59:06,215 --> 00:59:08,798
(Dennis sighs)

985
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:13,907
(phone dings)

986
00:59:15,615 --> 00:59:18,282
(brakes squeal)

987
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:30,796
- [Dennis] Donna?

988
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,893
Donna!

989
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,784
Donna?

990
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:53,445
Donna!

991
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:56,517
Donna!

992
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:00,355
I'll kill you.

993
01:00:05,524 --> 01:00:08,774
(dramatic organ music)

994
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,290
- So, the first time
Gary became violent was

995
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,630
when his mother came to visit?

996
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,640
- Yeah, I had a
disagreement with his mother

997
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,973
over some silly movie.

998
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:31,940
- [Woman] Mr. Yaklich.

999
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,360
- Officer Yaklich.

1000
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,280
- Officer Yaklich, Donna is
going to stay for a while.

1001
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,340
- No, she's not.

1002
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,780
- She needs counseling.

1003
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,330
For that matter, you might
consider counseling yourself.

1004
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,490
- Listen, lady, I don't wanna hear

1005
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,760
any of your psychobabble crap, all right?

1006
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,800
You find my wife and you find my son, now.

1007
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,507
- You're abusing your position, officer.

1008
01:00:49,507 --> 01:00:52,497
- All right so file a
complaint, but you get 'em

1009
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:54,370
and you get 'em out here
right now, you understand me?

1010
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,320
Or I'll turn this whorehouse
into a parking lot.

1011
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,550
- Please, we guarantee
these women protection.

1012
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,814
Don't violate that trust.

1013
01:01:01,814 --> 01:01:04,647
(Dennis chuckles)

1014
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,300
- [Woman] Sometimes, when
people feel threatened,

1015
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,310
the only way they know
how to deal with it,

1016
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,593
is to resort to violence and...

1017
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,232
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

1018
01:01:26,955 --> 01:01:29,705
(car approaches)

1019
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,537
(brakes squeal)

1020
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,119
- Come on.

1021
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,563
Go in the house.

1022
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,697
See you later, Eddie.

1023
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:12,509
(shutters rattle)

1024
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:15,009
(tense music)

1025
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,323
Do you know how bad I wanna kill you?

1026
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,213
- Yes, I do.

1027
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,440
- If you ever try and take
my son away from me again,

1028
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:34,083
I'm gonna cut your sister Susie's
throat and make you watch.

1029
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,770
Then you know what I'm
gonna do to you, huh?

1030
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:40,610
- No.

1031
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,957
What're you gonna do?

1032
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,737
- I'm gonna slice you up,

1033
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:48,693
and bury little pieces of
you all over the Rockies.

1034
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:50,680
And guess what?

1035
01:02:51,613 --> 01:02:53,453
- What?
- I'll get away with it.

1036
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,133
(Donna sobs)

1037
01:02:57,133 --> 01:02:59,083
- Wouldn't be the first time, would it?

1038
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,950
- What's that supposed to mean?

1039
01:03:07,987 --> 01:03:12,027
- You killed your first wife, didn't you?

1040
01:03:12,027 --> 01:03:13,243
You killed Barbra.

1041
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,513
I saw the death certificate.

1042
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,790
You, Patty said she was perfectly fine,

1043
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,090
two hours before she died.

1044
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,857
You killed her.

1045
01:03:26,857 --> 01:03:27,943
(Dennis chuckles)

1046
01:03:27,943 --> 01:03:31,370
- What've we got here,
is this Detective Donna

1047
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:34,049
on the case now, huh? (giggles)

1048
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:36,987
- I wanna die, (sobs) I just wanna die.

1049
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:40,660
- Oh, "I wanna die, I just wanna die."

1050
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,017
Well, do the world a favor
and pull the trigger!

1051
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:44,217
Here, take it.

1052
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:47,320
Take it, take it and put
it up to that stupid head.

1053
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,289
No, do it right, do it right.

1054
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:50,289
Put it here.

1055
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:53,369
What's the matter?

1056
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:55,233
You can't do it, huh?

1057
01:03:55,233 --> 01:03:57,769
(Donna sobs)

1058
01:03:57,769 --> 01:03:58,673
I can.

1059
01:03:58,673 --> 01:03:59,881
(gun cocks)

1060
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:00,714
- No, no.

1061
01:04:02,457 --> 01:04:03,945
- Here comes the pain.

1062
01:04:03,945 --> 01:04:06,362
(gun clicks)

1063
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:09,923
(chuckles)

1064
01:04:11,865 --> 01:04:12,698
Oh.

1065
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,390
Oops.

1066
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,281
I guess I ran outta bullets.

1067
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:19,281
- Go away!

1068
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:21,910
- I'm never goin' away, Donna, I love you!

1069
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:24,634
We're just havin' little
marital problems, that's all.

1070
01:04:24,634 --> 01:04:29,217
(giggles)
(Donna sobs)

1071
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:34,010
(somber music)

1072
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,760
(car approaches)

1073
01:04:40,761 --> 01:04:43,178
(door slams)

1074
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:46,169
- Good mornin'!

1075
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,163
Are you okay, Donna?

1076
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:03,560
- Eddie, I need you to do something.

1077
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,417
- You got it.

1078
01:05:08,203 --> 01:05:10,173
- I want you to kill Dennis for me.

1079
01:05:11,596 --> 01:05:14,960
(Eddie chuckles)

1080
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,570
- You're joking me, right?

1081
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:18,550
- No, I'm not joking.

1082
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,743
My life is in danger.

1083
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:33,920
- He beats you, don't he?

1084
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,530
- Somebody's gonna die,
it's either him or me.

1085
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:38,530
- You really believe that?
- I know it.

1086
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:42,120
- (sighs) I don't know,
that's a heavy thing.

1087
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,420
- Eddie.

1088
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,273
You can save me.

1089
01:05:45,186 --> 01:05:46,490
- I wouldn't want you to die, Donna.

1090
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,100
You're a wonderful woman,
I've always thought that.

1091
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,970
You know that, don't you?

1092
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,930
- That's why I'm asking you, Eddie.

1093
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:54,920
I don't know who to ask,
no one will help me.

1094
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,960
I'm locked up in that house
waiting for Dennis to kill me

1095
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,660
and leave my son without a mother.

1096
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,230
- I'll do it.

1097
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:13,330
- Swear you won't tell anyone.

1098
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,163
- I swear.

1099
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:18,550
Of course, it'd be nice if
you made it worth my while.

1100
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:21,973
- I'll get you the money.

1101
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,630
After I had that first talk with Eddie,

1102
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:26,943
I wondered if I was doing the right thing.

1103
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,230
I kept telling myself it was the only way.

1104
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,503
He was gonna kill me,
this was self-defense.

1105
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:35,693
But still...

1106
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:40,323
Taking his life was
the worst sin possible.

1107
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,373
I tried to remember the times
I loved him, but I couldn't.

1108
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:55,540
Eddie.

1109
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,670
What's the problem?
- Look, this ain't easy, okay?

1110
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:00,600
I've never killed anybody before.

1111
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,830
- We knew it wasn't gonna be easy.

1112
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,680
- I say we do it near the house,

1113
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,650
when he comes home from work.

1114
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:07,500
See, that way there won't
be any people around.

1115
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,060
- My son will be around,
any place but the house.

1116
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,140
- But everywhere else I go,
he's surrounded by cops!

1117
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,060
You know, what am I supposed to do?

1118
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,846
- Not near the house.

1119
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:18,790
(Eddie sighs)

1120
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,430
- I'm gonna need some help.

1121
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:21,263
- Then get some.

1122
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,880
- What about money?

1123
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,102
- All right, how much do you want?

1124
01:07:34,102 --> 01:07:36,019
- I don't know, 40,000?

1125
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:40,410
- I don't have that kind
of money, nowhere near it!

1126
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,553
- Well, I ain't gonna
do it without no money.

1127
01:07:51,393 --> 01:07:52,226
- Okay.

1128
01:07:53,577 --> 01:07:56,210
I'll get you 5,000 after you do it and uh,

1129
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,540
I'll think of some way
to get you the rest.

1130
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,520
Eddie and I would meet, talk, make plans.

1131
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,650
We were always making plans.

1132
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,450
- This is my brother, Charlie, all right?

1133
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:07,283
He's gonna help.

1134
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,150
- I don't know, let me think about it.

1135
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,620
- I'm a better shot than Eddie,

1136
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,270
and I can use some of that money.

1137
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,923
- Okay, I can't hang on much longer.

1138
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,120
- All right, now we're gonna
need some money for ammo.

1139
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,050
- And gas, too.

1140
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,883
- Okay.

1141
01:08:30,601 --> 01:08:33,390
(suspenseful music)

1142
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,033
Here, now please, just do it.

1143
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:39,473
- Oh, you got enough cash in
there for a couple of burgers?

1144
01:08:39,473 --> 01:08:40,556
I'm starvin'.

1145
01:08:55,496 --> 01:08:58,079
(somber music)

1146
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:14,890
- Mommy, is the Golden Gate
Bridge made out of real gold?

1147
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,770
- No, honey, it's not.

1148
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:20,150
- 'Cause if it was, I would
go there and get some gold

1149
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:23,030
for you so you could buy
something and it'd make you happy.

1150
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:28,030
- Oh, Denny, you make me
happy, that's all I need.

1151
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,923
- No, you're not happy, Mommy, you're sad.

1152
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:33,973
I'll do anything to make you happy.

1153
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:42,210
- Then promise me that you'll
never be cruel to anyone,

1154
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:46,518
or hurt anyone, that you'll
always be a good boy.

1155
01:09:46,518 --> 01:09:48,101
- I promise, Mommy.

1156
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,913
- I love you.

1157
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:55,155
Sweet dreams.

1158
01:09:58,614 --> 01:10:00,871
(somber music)

1159
01:10:00,871 --> 01:10:04,749
(thunder claps)
(rain splashes)

1160
01:10:04,749 --> 01:10:07,920
(phone rings)

1161
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,140
Hello?

1162
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,543
- Donna, Donna, are you awake?

1163
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,330
- [Donna] Yes, Dennis, I'm awake.

1164
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:16,840
- All right, this is what I want.

1165
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,463
Have you got cube steak?

1166
01:10:19,337 --> 01:10:20,843
- Mm-hm, cube steak.

1167
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,440
Mm-hm.

1168
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,770
What else?

1169
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:29,970
- You're gonna wear
that black dress, right?

1170
01:10:31,639 --> 01:10:32,472
- Right.

1171
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:44,537
(food sizzles)

1172
01:10:47,674 --> 01:10:50,924
(dramatic organ music)

1173
01:10:57,943 --> 01:10:59,289
(thunder claps)

1174
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:00,956
- I don't know, man.

1175
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:06,106
- Are you scared?

1176
01:11:07,153 --> 01:11:08,403
- I don't know.

1177
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,051
(gun cocks)

1178
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:23,384
(gun cocks)

1179
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:28,359
(brakes squeal)

1180
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,901
(guns fire)

1181
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:46,205
(glass smashes)
(dramatic music)

1182
01:12:46,205 --> 01:12:48,538
(gun fires)

1183
01:12:56,511 --> 01:13:01,511
(thunder claps)
(rain splashes)

1184
01:13:05,808 --> 01:13:06,944
- Dennis!

1185
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:08,527
Dennis!

1186
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:09,360
Dennis!

1187
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:12,481
Oh, God.

1188
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:17,584
(sobs)

1189
01:13:19,523 --> 01:13:24,523
(muffled chatter)
(siren wails)

1190
01:13:25,643 --> 01:13:27,493
- They sure didn't skimp on the lead.

1191
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,740
- Who do you think did it?

1192
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,244
- I don't know.

1193
01:13:33,244 --> 01:13:35,543
A lot of people would
like to see Dennis killed.

1194
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,690
Donna inside?

1195
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,980
- Yeah, her sister's with her.

1196
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:41,893
Kid's upstairs.

1197
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,223
- Honey, what're you doing up?

1198
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,283
- Mommy, are you okay?

1199
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,843
- Something has happened.

1200
01:13:59,843 --> 01:14:00,867
- Something bad?

1201
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,333
- Very bad.

1202
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,860
Denny?

1203
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,983
Denny, come away from the window, honey.

1204
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:17,603
- Where's my daddy?

1205
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:20,874
- Donna.

1206
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,930
The officers wanna talk to you now.

1207
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:28,595
- Come on, Denny, here's Mr. Bear.

1208
01:14:31,202 --> 01:14:33,386
You stay with Denny.

1209
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,219
- Have you told him yet?
- Not yet.

1210
01:14:43,352 --> 01:14:45,769
(Patty sobs)

1211
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,553
- Oh, God!

1212
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,200
- Donna, did Dennis say
where he was going tonight?

1213
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:07,393
- No, he um, he just
said he was working late.

1214
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:12,320
- Did you see anything, Donna?

1215
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,153
- No.

1216
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:16,220
I heard gunshots.

1217
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,320
- Did Dennis say anything about

1218
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,220
anybody who might've been responsible?

1219
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:24,200
- No, I uh...

1220
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,280
I didn't know his enemies.

1221
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,430
I didn't know his friends, he...

1222
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,530
We had a very, uh, private relationship.

1223
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,057
- Hurry up, man, I'm freezing my butt off.

1224
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:48,839
- Throw 'em in.

1225
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:54,496
(solemn organ music)

1226
01:16:19,768 --> 01:16:22,518
(Donna whispers)

1227
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,433
- Pueblo has lost a fine officer.

1228
01:16:40,412 --> 01:16:42,223
A fine, outstanding citizen.

1229
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:48,080
Donna, Dennis Jr. and Patty
have lost a loving father,

1230
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,180
and a devoted husband.

1231
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,963
We are here to mourn a man
and celebrate his memory.

1232
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,003
There is a young lad among us,

1233
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:04,050
who must be assured that
there is room for happiness,

1234
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,563
even in a time of deep sorrow.

1235
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,120
Denny, would you join me up here,

1236
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,920
while we offer a prayer of
eternal rest for your father?

1237
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,613
Up here, Denny.

1238
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:28,083
Let us offer up a prayer for eternal rest.

1239
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:34,370
Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,

1240
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:37,040
and let perpetual light
shine down upon him.

1241
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,140
- We're here at St. Theresa's
Roman Catholic Church

1242
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,940
where a large crowd, including
many law enforcement officers

1243
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:45,290
paid their final respects today
to Officer Dennis Yaklich.

1244
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,540
Yaklich, high decorated,

1245
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,970
was recognized as being a model policeman.

1246
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,710
He will be missed by his fellow officers.

1247
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,147
More than 500 people,

1248
01:17:54,147 --> 01:17:58,282
including 300 law enforcement
officers came to...

1249
01:17:58,282 --> 01:17:59,546
- [Woman] Thank you, sweetheart.

1250
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:04,546
Oh, did you hear about that
cop funeral, that was so sad.

1251
01:18:04,724 --> 01:18:07,890
- I'm hungry, where's my food?

1252
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,950
- What do I look like, a waiter?

1253
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,030
I don't know, okay?

1254
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:11,363
Go ask the waitress.

1255
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,000
- What is wrong with you anyway, Charlie?

1256
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,320
You've been so mean to me
the last couple of days.

1257
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,193
- I said, go ask the waitress.

1258
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,543
- You better stop being mean to me.

1259
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:24,215
(Charlie chuckles)

1260
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:26,133
- What're you gonna
do, you gonna shoot me?

1261
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:28,640
- God.

1262
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,560
Excuse me, we have some burgers over here.

1263
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:36,975
- We have got to keep it together!

1264
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:37,890
- We?

1265
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:38,790
I'm keeping it together.

1266
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,190
Look at you, you're
swigging down all the brews.

1267
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:43,910
- You just loved killin' him, didn't you?

1268
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,190
You just loved it.

1269
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:47,903
- You're the one who got me to
kill him in the first place.

1270
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,740
- Yeah, but I didn't love it.

1271
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,260
- Shut up.
- I ain't shuttin' up.

1272
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,669
- Just shut up, okay, shut up.

1273
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:55,597
- I ain't shuttin' up until I get

1274
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,870
the money that she promised, okay?

1275
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:01,870
(suspenseful music)

1276
01:19:36,093 --> 01:19:38,676
(somber music)

1277
01:19:55,548 --> 01:19:57,564
(dramatic music)

1278
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:00,231
(Dennis grunts)

1279
01:20:01,445 --> 01:20:04,112
(Dennis grunts)

1280
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,730
(Dennis grunts)

1281
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:13,977
(steel scrapes and clangs)

1282
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:16,477
(Donna gasps)

1283
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:22,662
(door clacks)

1284
01:20:22,662 --> 01:20:25,662
(suspenseful music)

1285
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,440
- Eddie Greenwell!

1286
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,072
Get your hands up!

1287
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:32,970
Get your hands up.

1288
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,000
- Couldn't keep her mouth shut.

1289
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,750
- You're under arrest for
the murder of Dennis Yaklich.

1290
01:20:39,896 --> 01:20:44,896
(background chatter)
(peaceful music)

1291
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,333
- Donna.

1292
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,963
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1293
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:54,390
It's been seven years since
I've been in a real restaurant.

1294
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,300
It's the first time we've
had any time to talk,

1295
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,100
that we haven't had to worry about...

1296
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:02,130
- I know it's terrible what
happened to Dennis, but,

1297
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:04,780
in a way, it's like you've
been released from prison.

1298
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,730
- It's more like an escape.

1299
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,280
- You have the right to remain silent.

1300
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,830
If you give up the right to
remain silent, anything you say

1301
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,890
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

1302
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:15,943
- It was Donna.

1303
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:23,220
- Okay, let's go.

1304
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,380
- You should use that money,

1305
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,370
and you should buy yourself something.

1306
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:30,590
Okay, go to California,
take Denny to California.

1307
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:33,340
I mean, he's always wanted to
go, he's never seen the ocean.

1308
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,470
- I'll drink to that.

1309
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,330
- Okay, to my sister.

1310
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:37,803
- To Denny.
- To Denny.

1311
01:21:39,205 --> 01:21:41,450
(phone rings)

1312
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,980
- [Anchor] Two brothers
were arrested tonight...

1313
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,610
- Hello?

1314
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,183
No, Donna's not here right now.

1315
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:50,098
- Dennis Yaklich, we have
just learned from the DA's...

1316
01:21:50,098 --> 01:21:52,395
- Who is this?

1317
01:21:52,395 --> 01:21:56,063
Oh, uh, she's at the Peacock Restaurant.

1318
01:21:57,004 --> 01:21:59,504
(sirens wail)

1319
01:22:01,747 --> 01:22:04,731
(background chatter)
(peaceful music)

1320
01:22:04,731 --> 01:22:07,755
(Donna and Patty giggle)

1321
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:09,750
- [Jerry] Donna.

1322
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,750
You're under arrest.

1323
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:14,458
- Arrest? What're you talking about?

1324
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:17,041
(somber music)

1325
01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:20,945
What's going on here?

1326
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,320
(background chatter)

1327
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,320
- I was charged with two counts.

1328
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,143
First degree murder and
conspiracy to commit murder.

1329
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,733
My trial was a free ring circus.

1330
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,923
I had only one thought in mind.

1331
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:48,950
If I wasn't executed, would I
now be separated from my son

1332
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,403
for the rest of my life?

1333
01:22:51,835 --> 01:22:53,385
And who would take care of him?

1334
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,240
I was a battered woman.

1335
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,930
Lenore Walker, a psychologist
who was an authority on

1336
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:09,563
the battered wife syndrome,
testified on my behalf.

1337
01:23:09,563 --> 01:23:10,663
- I've read her books.

1338
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:15,700
- [Donna] My lawyers felt that
Dr. Walker's expert testimony

1339
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,780
could do for me what she'd
done for other battered women.

1340
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,490
Get me acquitted.

1341
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:23,930
- Clearly Donna was caught in
a cycle of marital violence

1342
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:27,083
and she saw her only escape
as kill or be killed.

1343
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:31,390
I've spent many hours with
Mrs. Yaklich since her arrest

1344
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,930
and I firmly believe that
she felt she was in...

1345
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,600
- Imminent danger.

1346
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,000
- Donna believed that she
could not stop the violence.

1347
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,070
She reached a point where...

1348
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,160
- Fear turns to terror.

1349
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,770
- There was a parallel in
Donna's mind as to her situation

1350
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:49,270
and that of her husband's
first wife, Barbra Yaklich.

1351
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:52,520
She felt that Barbra
did not die by accident,

1352
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,790
and if her husband got away with it once...

1353
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:56,490
- He could get away with it again.

1354
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,010
Then the DA brought in Dr. Cassover.

1355
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:03,883
- Donna Yaklich may or may
not be a battered woman.

1356
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,630
The indication that women
are victims is a myth.

1357
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:09,943
Men get battered, too.

1358
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:14,090
They just have difficulty reporting it.

1359
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,120
And the term, "battered wife syndrome"

1360
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,200
is nothing more than a phrase
invented by Dr. Walker.

1361
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,210
I certainly don't subscribe to her methods

1362
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:26,080
of affixing that label to women.

1363
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,030
- Dr. Cassover, did
you personally evaluate

1364
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,150
or interview Mrs. Yaklich?

1365
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:30,983
- [Cassover] No.

1366
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:34,623
- [Attorney] Then upon what
do you base your evaluation?

1367
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,150
- I have reviewed Mrs.
Yaklich's previous testimony,

1368
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:41,433
and I have read Dr. Walker's books.

1369
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,410
- It was tough for Patty to testify, but,

1370
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:47,500
she insisted on being there for me.

1371
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,223
- Donna was Dennis's slave.

1372
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:55,683
At one point, she told me
she was gonna kill herself.

1373
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:01,213
That she just couldn't
go on living anymore.

1374
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,310
She said she was scared to do anything,

1375
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:07,183
in fear that Dennis might react.

1376
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:11,150
I mean, it was like walking
on egg shells in that house.

1377
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:14,033
One day, everything was
okay and then the next day,

1378
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:19,623
the TV would be up too loud
and Dennis would get so mad.

1379
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,550
And she was just tired of living that way.

1380
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,973
- Did she seem scared or frightened?

1381
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,640
- Yes, she did.

1382
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,140
- There were many who
believed there was no problem.

1383
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,630
It was all in my head.

1384
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:37,530
- Like I told you before, I
rode with Dennis for many years,

1385
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:41,200
and he never mentioned anything
about any marital problems.

1386
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,820
- There were those of us who thought that

1387
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:45,130
Dennis was a model cop.

1388
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,060
And a great role model.

1389
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:48,860
Everyone on the force respected him.

1390
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:01,810
- Has the jury arrived at its verdict?

1391
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:03,310
- [Woman] We have, Your Honor.

1392
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,160
- Please rise for the verdict.

1393
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:20,117
- "We, the jury, find Donna Yaklich

1394
01:26:20,117 --> 01:26:22,156
"not guilty of first degree murder."

1395
01:26:22,156 --> 01:26:24,151
(court murmurs)

1396
01:26:24,151 --> 01:26:26,070
(gavel clacks)

1397
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,903
- Order!

1398
01:26:29,263 --> 01:26:31,177
- "And on the charge of conspiracy

1399
01:26:31,177 --> 01:26:33,959
"to commit first degree murder, guilty."

1400
01:26:33,959 --> 01:26:35,800
(court murmurs)

1401
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,740
- Donna, now you beat the
most dangerous charge.

1402
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:39,730
Now, we'll deal with the
second charge, we'll file

1403
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,295
for a new trial based on
the inconsistent verdict.

1404
01:26:42,295 --> 01:26:44,056
- Where is my son?

1405
01:26:44,056 --> 01:26:45,856
Where's Denny, where's Denny?

1406
01:26:45,856 --> 01:26:49,111
I need to get to my son, Denny!

1407
01:26:49,111 --> 01:26:49,944
- Mommy!

1408
01:26:51,769 --> 01:26:54,215
- Let me just have a minute!

1409
01:26:54,215 --> 01:26:55,048
- Mommy!

1410
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:02,495
- Let me just have a minute, okay?

1411
01:27:02,495 --> 01:27:03,412
- Back off!

1412
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,453
- We asked the judge for leniency.

1413
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,640
I pleaded for the opportunity to raise you

1414
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,940
and start life over, but the judge said...

1415
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,530
- There are aggravating
circumstances here.

1416
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:22,060
Granting probation to a woman
who's plotted the murder

1417
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:25,380
of her husband would be
a miscarriage of justice.

1418
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,180
You started this, Mrs. Yaklich.

1419
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,550
I must give you a harsher
sentence than the two brothers

1420
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:31,200
you hired to perform the slaying.

1421
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:36,713
- The judge's sentence cut
me like a knife because

1422
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,973
I knew we'd be separated.

1423
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,060
You were the only good thing in my life.

1424
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,190
- I remember saying goodbye to you.

1425
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,373
Moving in with Aunt Susie.

1426
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:58,340
Every day, I waited for
you to come take me home.

1427
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,083
Look, I gotta go.

1428
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,010
They say if you'd have
pulled the trigger yourself,

1429
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:12,010
you would've walked.

1430
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:13,803
- Maybe.

1431
01:28:15,438 --> 01:28:16,271
But...

1432
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:19,790
I couldn't have ever pulled that trigger.

1433
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:21,090
- Okay, tell me something.

1434
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:25,493
If you could do it over again,
would you still have done it?

1435
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,183
- Yes.

1436
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:35,130
It's a terrible thing to take
another person's life, it's,

1437
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:36,803
it's terrible to take a,

1438
01:28:38,228 --> 01:28:40,083
a father away from his son, but,

1439
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,983
if I hadn't done that, I'd be dead.

1440
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,160
- [Denny] You really believe that?

1441
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,583
- Yes.

1442
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:56,524
- What about my survival?

1443
01:28:56,524 --> 01:28:59,110
You don't know what it's like
growing up in a world where

1444
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,910
everybody knows that your
mother had your father killed.

1445
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,320
Didn't you ever think of that?

1446
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,033
When I look at pictures of Dad,

1447
01:29:10,948 --> 01:29:13,548
do you know I can still
remember the way he smelled?

1448
01:29:15,190 --> 01:29:18,283
The way he laughed and messed my hair.

1449
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:23,030
How strong his arms felt
when he was holding me.

1450
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:26,273
And I remember seeing him at his funeral.

1451
01:29:28,188 --> 01:29:31,530
And this overwhelming emptiness inside me.

1452
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,283
Mom, why did you wanna
tell me all this, now?

1453
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:41,613
- You're 18.

1454
01:29:43,637 --> 01:29:46,673
And you're going away to
college, in San Francisco.

1455
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:50,840
You're finally gonna get to
see the Golden Gate Bridge.

1456
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,483
You're starting a new life
and I wanted to tell you,

1457
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:59,703
in my own words, from my heart,

1458
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,360
I wanted to look in your eyes.

1459
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,473
- Okay, fine.

1460
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:12,740
- Denny, I spent my entire
marriage to your father,

1461
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,223
afraid that he was gonna kill me.

1462
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:20,070
And I've spent every day
in prison afraid that

1463
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:24,513
that when you grew up, you
would hate me for what I did.

1464
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:31,060
- [Guard] Visitation hours are now over.

1465
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:33,043
All visitors will prepare to leave.

1466
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,990
- All right, I better go.

1467
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:45,913
- Do well in school.

1468
01:30:48,372 --> 01:30:49,290
(Denny sighs)

1469
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,783
- You take care of yourself.

1470
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:52,485
- I will.

1471
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:55,777
I love you, Denny.

1472
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,790
- I've missed you, Mom.

1473
01:31:01,851 --> 01:31:04,101
I've resented you for
so long for leaving me,

1474
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:06,403
I've been angry at you,

1475
01:31:08,612 --> 01:31:10,162
but I never stopped loving you.

1476
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,370
And when you get out of prison,

1477
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,003
I'm gonna be here to pick you up.

1478
01:31:17,244 --> 01:31:18,547
And we'll drive up to California

1479
01:31:18,547 --> 01:31:20,197
and we'll see the ocean together.

1480
01:31:33,925 --> 01:31:36,342
(door slams)

1481
01:31:45,725 --> 01:31:48,392
(buzzer buzzes)

1482
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,960
- [Donna] The average
prison sentence for a woman

1483
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,960
who kills her husband is 15 to 20 years.

1484
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,800
For a man who kills his
wife, two to six years.

1485
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,960
I was sentenced to 40 years for
conspiracy to commit murder.

1486
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,490
I have served five and a half years

1487
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:22,930
and I have filed for a
motion for reconsideration

1488
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:25,947
of my sentence, which is
currently under review.

1489
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,782
(somber music)
