1
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,934
Yeah?

2
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:33,346
Yeah, I got it.

3
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:21,183
Take it easy, Lu.
You gotta have a little faith.

4
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,510
Relax.
Have something to eat.

5
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:27,166
<i>There's some more stuff
in the fridge, if you like.</i>

6
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:31,025
- You want some coffee?
- No, I just want this to be over with.

7
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,201
<i>I'm gonna lie down.</i>

8
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:45,314
<i>- Lu, you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.</i>

9
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:55,234
<i>- Hi, baby.
- Hi.</i>

10
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,748
Thanks.
Come here, come here.

11
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:00,308
Come over here.

12
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,970
- You got to take it easy.
- I shouldn't have done this, Michael.

13
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,381
- This is insane.
- Come on, come on.

14
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:09,413
Come on, look what it's done.
I mean, look where we are.

15
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:12,421
Well, won't last forever.

16
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:16,965
Yes, it will. This is
gonna last forever.

17
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:21,945
- You don't know these people.
- Let's just get through the trial.

18
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:25,676
Then we'll get the hell out of
the country, just you and me.

19
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:32,563
- I love you.
- I love you too, kid.

20
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:47,999
<i>I had such a great time
at the party last night.</i>

21
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:51,318
<i>They always get
the best caterers.</i>

22
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,840
I don't know where they find them.
That food was great.

23
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,367
<i>What do we have here?</i>

24
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,585
<i>- McNamara, you there?
- Yeah, we're here.</i>

25
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,780
<i>We have a septic truck
right in front of the house.</i>

26
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:10,709
3-5-2-M-S-R.

27
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,364
Running the plate.

28
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:16,879
<i>"You dump it... We pump it."</i>

29
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:19,837
- Sounds like a government job.
- Yeah.

30
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,153
<i>Okay, the license plate checks out.</i>

31
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:34,133
<i>We have
a scheduled pump for today.</i>

32
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:37,321
Lucky us,
or should I say, lucky you?

33
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,320
You may unfasten your safety belts
and rhumba around the cabin.

34
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:49,793
<i>We have a pizza delivery this time.</i>

35
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:53,370
<i>Running the plate now.</i>

36
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:05,455
- What the hell, you guys didn't order pizza, did you?
- No, it's 7:00 in the morning.

37
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,586
<i>- Oh, shi...
We have a Code Red!</i>

38
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,566
Ready? Now!

39
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:31,112
- Freeze! Move!
- Turn around!

40
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,880
<i>I didn't do nothin'! I swear!</i>

41
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,283
I swear
I didn't do nothin'!

42
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,054
<i>- Hey!
- Relax!</i>

43
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:44,229
- Is it wired?
- I don't know!

44
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,487
Hey, this truck's
not pumpin' out, it's pumpin' in!

45
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:54,227
- Lu, get outta the house!
- Lu, get out!

46
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,546
Hey, go on and get
that truck outta there!

47
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,740
<i>Get that truck
outta here!</i>

48
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:15,347
Lu, get out!
Lu! Lu!

49
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,137
- Out the back!
- This way! This way!

50
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,811
Okay, get it outta here!
Get it out!

51
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,640
This way! Go!

52
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:00,077
Run, Lu, run!

53
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,784
Lu, help!
Aaah!

54
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:08,571
<i>Lu! Lu!</i>

55
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,749
Oh, my God!
Michael!

56
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:01,263
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

57
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:04,683
This is...
unbelievable!

58
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:08,771
The truck was filled with gasoline.
The guy must have had a remote.

59
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,605
Well, he detonated
his truck.

60
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,348
<i>Once they found out
where the safe house was,</i>

61
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:17,965
<i>it would have been easy
to find schedules.</i>

62
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:20,821
He probably intercepted the truck
sometime before the last stop.

63
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,757
<i>- We've uncovered another body.
- Where is it?</i>

64
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,618
Over there.
That makes number three.

65
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,930
- Is this Delano or not?
- No, I don't think so.

66
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,030
This weapon's
police issue.

67
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:46,869
Our entire case against Costanzo
is based on Delano's testimony.

68
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:49,582
So I would really like to know
if she is alive or dead...

69
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,331
<i>before I call her
to the witness stand!</i>

70
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:56,687
I can't take this goombah into court
with a bunch of circumstantial crap!

71
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,972
He'll walk, just like he
walked the last two times.

72
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:02,534
Hello! This was your responsibility,
sir, and you blew it!

73
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,452
- Don't you dare pin this on me!
- Don't talk back to me!

74
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:08,895
Hey, listen!
This whole operation was compromised!

75
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:11,955
<i>- Back off!
- What you people don't seem to be able to understand...</i>

76
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,231
is that without
this witness, I have no case!

77
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:17,638
<i>Now, can anyone tell me
if she is dead?</i>

78
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:21,966
Sir, I don't
think she's one of the bodies.

79
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,947
- You think she survived this?
- I've looked at all the bodies we found.

80
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,836
None of them match
Delano's description.

81
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,035
Are you telling me
that she's alive?

82
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:39,633
Well, she's definitely not
one of the bodies we have.

83
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:44,930
Then where the hell is she?

84
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,706
- Hey.
- Loser.

85
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:33,422
- I think it's him.
- Where?

86
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:35,356
Long hair
over by the pickup.

87
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:40,014
Hey, what do ya got?

88
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:44,690
- You sure? - Son-of-a-bitch
killed my friends. Cut me bad.

89
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:47,193
- Think I'd forget?
- We got a positive I.D.

90
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:50,057
Told you not to bother me
unless it was important.

91
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:54,032
- Hope you're wearin' sun block.
- I'm a construction worker. I need rays.

92
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,808
<i>He's coming in your direction.
Fatigues, glasses, long hair.</i>

93
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,482
- Whoo! What have we got here?
- Hey, you jerk!

94
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:05,059
I think we should arrest him
for what he's wearing.

95
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,108
Yeah, he looks like he's on page 26
of Madonna's sex book.

96
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:12,887
<i>I got him.</i>

97
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:14,690
Think it's safe to assume
he's armed and dangerous?

98
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:17,235
- Wanna yell, "Freeze"?
- I yelled "Freeze" last time.

99
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,331
<i>- Go ahead, it makes you feel better.
- No, no, no.</i>

100
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,505
Hey, stay here.
No, no, you get hurt, it's my ass.

101
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:42,288
<i>Wait, wait! Hold it!</i>

102
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,305
<i>Whoops.</i>

103
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:57,906
Yes! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

104
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:02,207
What are you lookin' at?
Go after 'im!

105
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:06,328
<i>No, I've seen this one before.
You go there. I'll take the back.</i>

106
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,662
- He's goin' upstairs!
- Got it!

107
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:27,485
<i>- Aah!
- Freeze! Oh!</i>

108
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,936
Uh, just a hunch, but I don't think
this guy's gonna go in peacefully.

109
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,186
Freeze!

110
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,516
He's not freezing!

111
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:41,946
- Try, "Stop or I'll shoot!"
- Stop or I'll shoot!

112
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,432
Nope!
Anything else?

113
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,730
Did you say,
"Simon says"?

114
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,511
Watch a pro.

115
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:53,106
- Police! You're under arrest!
- Whoa!

116
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,577
Aaah!

117
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,966
Chris!

118
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,832
Aaah!

119
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:18,088
Yuck!

120
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:20,931
So that's how
a pro does it, huh?

121
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,609
Die.

122
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:38,969
Hey, wait! Wait! Whoa, whoa!
Seattle P.D., stop that truck!

123
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:52,126
Hey! Seattle P.D.!
Stop!

124
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:54,837
Stop the truck!

125
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,125
- Stop the truck.
- What?

126
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:01,104
My partner's
in the back.

127
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,264
Da-daaaa!

128
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,434
<i>I'm hit!</i>

129
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:34,173
<i>Let's get outta here!</i>

130
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,817
Son-of-a-bitch
killed my friend.

131
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,521
Drop it!

132
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,203
Mm-hmm.

133
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:53,360
Shi...
Oh, no.

134
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:00,910
<i>Yeah, what do you want?</i>

135
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,961
- Gina Garrett for the captain.
- Okay.

136
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:07,174
Gina Garrett for you.

137
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:10,476
Hey, you two!

138
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:13,340
Stinky, Reimers!
Captain's havin' a hemorrhoid.

139
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:16,447
Wants your butts
in his office A.S.A.P.

140
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,085
- I'm sorry, Gina Garrett, was it?
- Gina Garrett, yes.

141
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,410
<i>In!</i>

142
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,544
<i>All right,
gimme a minute. I'll get back to ya.</i>

143
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,379
Oh, let me guess.

144
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:32,810
Sanitation and construction.
Two of my favorites... Uh-uh-uh-uh!

145
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:35,230
Don't you dare sit in
those chairs. Either of ya.

146
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,728
Detective Lecce, is this the weapon
involved in the assault?

147
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,633
- Yes, sir, Captain, sir.
- Do we know whose weapon it is?

148
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:43,817
- Yes, Captain, sir, it's mine.
- Okay, let's get some facts straight.

149
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:47,344
Winston and I don't want Internal
Affairs pointing a finger at us,

150
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,962
<i>saying that we didn't
do ourjob right.</i>

151
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:53,255
The gun fell out of my hand because I
happened to be falling out of a window.

152
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,154
Witness picked it up,
shot the suspect. Sue me.

153
00:16:55,138 --> 00:16:59,541
Since this is now classified
as an officer-involved shooting,

154
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:02,884
<i>- you two won't mind a quick visit with the D.A.'s office.
- What?</i>

155
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:05,343
- The guy was resisting arrest!
- It took the two of us to hold him down!

156
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:07,406
<i>- He can't file charges against me!
- Really?</i>

157
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,489
<i>- The gun was falling out of my hand!
- Hey! Hey!</i>

158
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:14,385
- Who said anything about filing charges?
- You said the D.A.'s office!

159
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:18,899
I didn't say anything. You two are
temporarily reassigned to the D.A.'s office.

160
00:17:18,785 --> 00:17:21,720
<i>- They'd like to stop by and tell you why.
- Do we get a choice?</i>

161
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:26,602
Choice?
A handcuffed suspect?

162
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:31,014
- Good afternoon.
- Phillip. Gentlemen.

163
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:34,911
<i>Gentlemen, this is Assistant
District Attorney Gina Garrett.</i>

164
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:37,249
<i>- This is Det. Chris Lecce and Det. Bill Reimers.
- Hello.</i>

165
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:41,743
- Oh, I'm really sorry about that.
- Don't use my scarf!

166
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,930
- I got some spaghetti all over...
- Everything's fine.

167
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:47,456
Gentlemen, this assignment's
confidential. Don't discuss it.

168
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:51,223
<i>Two days ago the Las Vegas D.A.
and the U.S. Department ofJustice...</i>

169
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:54,194
asked us to help find a witness
who was gonna testify...

170
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,406
against the head
of a Chicago crime family.

171
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:59,249
Luella Delano was the witness.

172
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:03,328
<i>Justice had her under protective custody
until someone blew up the safe house,</i>

173
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,028
<i>- killing several agents.
- How many are several?</i>

174
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,950
<i>Three.
Somehow she got away.</i>

175
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:13,593
She's made no attempt to contact the Department
ofJustice or the Las Vegas D.A. since then.

176
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:16,267
- What, no postcard?
- No.

177
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,155
Trial begins next week.
The Feds are all worked up.

178
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,837
Apparently, without Delano
the government has no case.

179
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:24,323
So all leads are being followed,
including one which leads here.

180
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:29,623
<i>Phone call Delano made to a number here in
Seattle belonging to a Brian and Pam O'Hara.</i>

181
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:32,062
- She may be lookin' to lay low with them.
- Anybody check the O'Haras?

182
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,622
They left for their vacation home
on Bainbridge Island two days ago...

183
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,920
which makes putting them
under surveillance a little tricky.

184
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:39,588
- Stakeout.
- We heard you're good at it.

185
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:43,847
We cannot rotate surveillance teams.
You'll be on it round the clock.

186
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:48,301
I have managed to secure the house next to
the O'Haras. It belongs toJudge Hoberman.

187
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:51,486
- Maximum Dave?
- I've had to promise on my career...

188
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,617
that nothing would happen to his house, so
gentlemen, nothing had better happen to his house.

189
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,607
- So no wipin' your boogers on the sofa.
- Don't say boogers!

190
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,528
- It's a habit ya have to break.
- What's the matter...

191
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:04,008
Your cover is you're renting the
judge's house for a month of vacation.

192
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:06,264
<i>As what, friends or lovers?</i>

193
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:09,431
We think you'll be able
to pass for father and son.

194
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,864
What, are you kidding me?

195
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,914
- Uh-uh.
- Dad?

196
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,332
- No way! Just stop it right now.
- Papa!

197
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,198
- And I'll be going with you?
- Really? As my granddaughter?

198
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:24,114
- No, your wife.
- My wife?

199
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:26,958
- Your second wife actually.
- Look, boss, this is not...

200
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:28,896
Detective!
I'm the boss.

201
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:32,551
<i>- You're the...
- Yes, Detective, I am the boss.</i>

202
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:36,135
Okay, this is a joke, right?

203
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:50,718
Okeydoke.
I'll see ya later.

204
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:54,044
- Uh, Daddy?
- Don't start with that crap.

205
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:58,036
- I'm just practicing.
- Oh, practice your prayers, pal.

206
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:00,672
Come on, come on.
Just try calling me "son"just once.

207
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,757
- You're really getting off on this one. The dad thing.
- Hello, son.

208
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:06,041
The thing with the dad and the son
thing. This is a big chuckle, right?

209
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:09,671
- We have to be able to talk.
- Eat me. How's that?

210
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,354
Does Maria let you
talk to her like that?

211
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:17,304
I'm my own man. When you're all grown
up, you'll understand what that means.

212
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,358
- Hey, Ray. What are you doin'?
- Chris.

213
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:27,012
Helpin' my sister out.
Sorry, nothin' personal.

214
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,801
"Nothing personal"?

215
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,043
Maria!

216
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:38,980
<i>- Get out!
- What the hell is going on here?</i>

217
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:41,662
<i>- I said, "Get out."
- I know what you said.</i>

218
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,453
Then do it
and take your stuff!

219
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:47,339
<i>Maria, talk to me.</i>

220
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,445
Maria.

221
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,150
- Are you throwing me out?
- Yes!

222
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:55,974
- What the hell is wrong?
- Nothing your leaving won't cure.

223
00:20:55,923 --> 00:21:00,417
<i>Did I miss a couple of pages? Exactly
what is it I'm supposed to have done?</i>

224
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:04,004
- You came home.
- I always come home. It's what I do before I go back to work.

225
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:07,585
Well, I am saving you
a trip.

226
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,633
Could we go back
a couple of steps?

227
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:12,109
<i>Not that many either.
Just like last night.</i>

228
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:16,644
<i>Remember? I came home, we had dinner,
we made love, we went to sleep.</i>

229
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,364
In the morning, I got up and went
to work. Now did I miss something?

230
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,726
<i>Ooh!</i>

231
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:27,827
I'm leaving.
When I come back, I want you gone.

232
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,663
No, not until
you tell me why.

233
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:32,447
Because I'm tired of wanting
something I'm not gonna get.

234
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:34,801
- You're happy. I'm not.
- Oh, Maria, we have been over this.

235
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,704
Don't bother, I don't want
to hear the reasons anymore.

236
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:41,710
Marriage doesn't work in my family. My
parents, my sisters, my brothers, aunts.

237
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,847
Everybody got divorc... If we got
married, that would be the end of this.

238
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:47,446
What do you think
this is?

239
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,638
- Maria. Maria, we love each other.
- Move!

240
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:53,643
Why do you want to ruin the whole
thing for a goddamn piece of paper?

241
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:56,076
Get out of my way,
you asshole!

242
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,040
I am not leaving.
Do you hear me? I am not leaving!

243
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:01,221
I'm willing to work this out.
I'm not leaving.

244
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,691
Okay, Chris.
You're right. You stay.

245
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:27,917
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

246
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:31,083
- Ha-ha-ha! Very funny.
- McGuire, Maria.

247
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:33,251
M-c-G-u-i-r-e.

248
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:36,198
Yes, I'd like to report
a domestic disturbance.

249
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:41,010
<i>That's right, isn't it? I'd hate to be
wrong after living with a cop for six years.</i>

250
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:45,370
<i>Yes, a domestic disturbance.
I'm being held against my will.</i>

251
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,579
<i>All right. All right!
I'll marry you!</i>

252
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,805
Life is too short.

253
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:16,170
I don't have much time,
so just listen.

254
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:20,406
- They don't think Delano's dead.
- Are you sure?

255
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,392
<i>- Yes, I'm sure.
- Well, then, where the hell is she?</i>

256
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:28,435
No one knows.
She hasn't contacted anybody.

257
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:32,394
Chances are, if they find her, it
won't be until after the trial anyway.

258
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:36,291
<i>- There's no guarantee.
- You're the guarantee, Hassrick.</i>

259
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:38,135
Do you understand me?

260
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:41,284
<i>It is not my fault.
It's your man.</i>

261
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:45,457
You just find her
and you call me. Got it?

262
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:48,753
Fine. I will.
If I find out.

263
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:04,701
Hey, guys. Sit tight. I'll be
with you in a second.

264
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,678
So, did she tell you why
or was it just...

265
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,790
- You know.
- Marriage.

266
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:12,006
- Mmm.
- Mmm, commitment thing.

267
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,070
- So what are you afraid of?
- Advice.

268
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:21,392
<i>Okay, guys, here it goes.
Unleaded fuel only.</i>

269
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:25,453
Check the oil when you fill it up
and don't try and use the car phone.

270
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,251
Because...
We disconnected it.

271
00:24:28,198 --> 00:24:32,225
I know you guys might feel a little
tempted to have some fun... Hey!

272
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,897
Chill! Keep your yang
in your pants.

273
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:37,947
This vehicle goes on sale
at the auction at the end of next week.

274
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:42,887
The guys upstairs expressly asked
me to ask you two not to mess it up.

275
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,419
You got that?
Okay.

276
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:50,080
- All right, guys, who gets
the keys? - Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

277
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:54,724
I'm the dad! This is a family car.
You'll have to beg.

278
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:13,530
- Hey!
- Whoo-ha!

279
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:18,076
Hey!

280
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,715
<i>Ave...</i>

281
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:26,496
So, what do you think?
Left or right?

282
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,496
<i>Well, maybe this
won't be so bad.</i>

283
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,400
We've been in worse situations
than this before, right?

284
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:37,328
Remember all that stuff
with Drooling Harry?

285
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:39,781
I told you never to mention
Drooling Harry again.

286
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:44,910
<i>This is it.
What clown painted this place?</i>

287
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:52,545
Archie, shut up!
I could use some help up here, please.

288
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:55,282
Help your mother.

289
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:01,339
Good boy, yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

290
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:05,582
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Are you nuts? Four bags?</i>

291
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,066
- Oh, please, don't give me that man thing.
- No, no, no.

292
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:11,228
- This is not a man thing. This is a woman thing.
- Well, this is what I'm taking.

293
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,432
Fine, take the bags!
We're stayin' here.

294
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:17,894
Isn't this great? Our first fight.
Feel like a family already.

295
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:21,486
Listen, Detective,
we're supposed to be well-to-do.

296
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:24,569
I cannot do well-to-do
with one change of clothes.

297
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:27,378
So this is what I'm taking.
Open the trunk.

298
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,386
<i>We could leave the bugging
equipment and recorder.</i>

299
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:37,506
<i>I suppose. Of course, we could
write down what they say.</i>

300
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:40,000
Should have taken that shorthand
course. What about the cameras?

301
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,900
- Leave 'em. You can draw pretty well.
- Yeah.

302
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:44,547
Just need to pick up some paper and
some crayons, the big thick ones.

303
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:49,276
- Don't leave the pictures on the refrigerator...
- All right. All right.

304
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:54,644
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

305
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,792
You cannot be paper
every time.

306
00:26:57,725 --> 00:27:00,888
- There are no rules in paper, rock, scissors.
- Yes, there are.

307
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,921
- No, there are not.
- Yes, there are.

308
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:07,597
- Yes, there are.
- Oh, God, don't be so childish.

309
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:14,765
Good boy, sit!

310
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:17,911
- I hope you're taking him for a walk.
- He's coming with us.

311
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,819
- Not a chance.
- No way.

312
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,704
<i>- What's the problem?
- We're on a job.</i>

313
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:24,285
What are you afraid
he's gonna tell the neighbors?

314
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,618
- Put him in a kennel.
I've never put him in a kennel.

315
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,878
And I'm not about to start now.
He is very well trained.

316
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:31,978
He'll simply lie by the fire.
I'll take him for walks.

317
00:27:31,963 --> 00:27:35,797
It doesn't get much more complicated than
that. Really. We're a family, gentlemen.

318
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,799
<i>- Families have dogs.
- Not this family.</i>

319
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,550
If he doesn't go,
I don't go.

320
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:51,887
Archie! Up!

321
00:27:54,681 --> 00:28:00,176
Don't make any sudden movements. He's
trained. He's not that well trained.

322
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:26,910
<i>So what do you think,
I should marry her?</i>

323
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,171
<i>It's only a stakeout, Chris.
It'll be over in a couple of days.</i>

324
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:31,577
<i>Maria!
I'm talking about Maria.</i>

325
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,511
<i>If you're asking me, I think you
should have married her six years ago.</i>

326
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:36,896
- Hmm, I was too young.
- How about now?

327
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:40,019
- I'm, I'm too old!
- Or maybe you're too late.

328
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:44,895
Did you ever think the reason she dumped you
was maybe because she's seein' another guy?

329
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,921
- If she was seein' somebody else, I'd know.
- Maybe!

330
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:50,387
No maybe.
I would know, all right?

331
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:53,554
If she was seein'
somebody else, I'd know.

332
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:57,327
Yeah, you're right. Beautiful girl
like her dumps you for a younger guy.

333
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,831
That could never happen.

334
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:02,994
Look at me, I've been married for
eight years. I have two wonderful kids.

335
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:06,766
I'm happy, still in love and not a
grey hair on my head. Now look at you.

336
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,610
- Have I done something to offend you?
- Do you love her?

337
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:11,793
- Yes! I love her.
- Then marry her! Commit to her.

338
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:15,668
You're not gonna find
a better woman than Maria.

339
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,506
Looks like
our time is up.

340
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:21,428
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, this stuff don't come cheap.

341
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:24,130
- Two, three bucks?
- Three. Thank you.

342
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:28,350
<i>Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt.</i>

343
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:30,871
Listen, I know that you feel
this assignment is beneath you.

344
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:34,669
Perhaps because I'm a woman, maybe because
I'm not a cop. It doesn't really matter.

345
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,104
The fact is, I'm really not
as bad as you think I am.

346
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,272
I'm hoping you're not
as bad as I think you are.

347
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,203
- He is.
- Look, you just do what you do and we'll do what we do.

348
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,520
- Okay? It really doesn't get anymore complicated than that.
- Fine.

349
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,824
That's fine. I've prepared our backgrounds in
case we come into contact with our neighbors.

350
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:53,309
We need to have a cohesive story.
I've tried to keep it simple.

351
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:56,931
Chris,
what's this word?

352
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:58,817
- "The."
- Oh, yeah.

353
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:02,397
There is one more thing. I think
that Bill should shave his mustache.

354
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,873
Excuse me?

355
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:09,140
Your mustache. It would make you look a lot
younger and you are supposed to be Chris' son.

356
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,974
- Forget it!
- I really think it would be more convincing.

357
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:14,981
I don't think you understand the
relationship a man has with his facial hair.

358
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:17,658
Oh, please! I am not asking you
to cut off your penis.

359
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,982
- Maybe you'd like to try!
- Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:24,184
I have had this mustache for 13
years! How long have you had yours?

361
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:31,869
Man's relationship
with his facial hair, eh?

362
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:00,257
- How's it goin'?
- I'm not talking to you. You took her side.

363
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,375
This is the second marriage
for you and the first for me, Chris.

364
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,074
- What happened to my first wife?
- Your first wife is dead.

365
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:09,556
- Hmm, great.
- You think this is stupid, don't you?

366
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:12,147
You have any idea what's
really goin' on here?

367
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:16,205
You know what a stakeout is all
about? You sit, you listen, you watch.

368
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:19,271
That's it.
You don't participate.

369
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:22,909
You don't go over and borrow a cup of
sugar and you don't bake them cookies.

370
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:25,524
- That about covers it.
- You know, Bill, you look a lot younger.

371
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,884
I look 12 years old!

372
00:31:43,147 --> 00:31:46,412
<i>- It's so beautiful.
- That one's ours.</i>

373
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:52,517
Not bad, Pop.

374
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,666
Archie, stay.

375
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,334
<i>Thank you, Bill.</i>

376
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:20,753
- You are unbelievable.
- I'm an innocent guy.

377
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,407
You want me
to carry you across the threshold?

378
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:27,521
No, we've been married
for five years. The thrill is gone.

379
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:36,975
Look at that view.

380
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:41,067
Oh, it's gorgeous.

381
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:44,165
Oh, look at these antiques.
My God, it must be worth a fortune!

382
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:46,094
Oh, I want to be a judge!

383
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,456
<i>Hey, it's Stickley!
Stickley's my favorite.</i>

384
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:57,049
Stickley's our favorite!

385
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:05,100
<i>This is fine-quality furniture, gentlemen.
Could you please be careful with your fingers?</i>

386
00:33:30,597 --> 00:33:33,065
<i>- Pretty good.
- Better here.</i>

387
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:35,553
<i>See everybody
comin'and goin'.</i>

388
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:45,235
Looks good to me.

389
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:57,511
Archie?
Oh, no. Archie, boy!

390
00:33:57,475 --> 00:34:00,444
Archie!

391
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,788
Oh, Lord.
Oh, no, Archie! Archie!

392
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:05,841
<i>No, boy! Archie!</i>

393
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:09,523
<i>- Mommy said, "No!"Archie!
- Oh, stop, it's gone.</i>

394
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:12,411
- Will you forget about it?
- I miss it! Okay?

395
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,853
He's headin' next door!
Archie!

396
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:20,981
<i>Archie! No, Archie!</i>

397
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,150
<i>No! Archie!</i>

398
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:28,386
<i>No!
Come back here, Archie!</i>

399
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:33,918
Archie!
No, Archie!

400
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,627
Wait for Mommy!
Archie!

401
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:40,411
Shoot the dog!

402
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:02,032
<i>No! Bad dog, Archie!
No! Mommy said, "No!"</i>

403
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,294
- Hi, is everything all right?
- Hi!

404
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,766
Oh, yes! Everything's fine.
My dog's not usually like this.

405
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:13,061
It's our dog, actually.
He's quite friendly.

406
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,289
I think, yeah, your cat's fine.
Just a little bit scared.

407
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:19,680
It's no problem. It's not even our cat. It
belongs to the Outlingers's down the road.

408
00:35:19,614 --> 00:35:21,707
<i>- Every dog in the neighborhood chases it.
- Every dog.</i>

409
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:26,256
<i>- I'm sorry about the garden.
- Don't worry about it.</i>

410
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:28,337
<i>- It's not gonna happen again.
- It's all right.</i>

411
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:31,981
- Are you staying around here?
- Yes, we've rented the house next door.

412
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:34,461
- Great!
- Oh, you know Judge Hoberman?

413
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:39,230
- Maximum Dave.
- Not, not well. We met him couple of times.

414
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,967
- Well, I'm Pam O'Hara. This is my husband, Brian.
- Hi!

415
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:45,613
Great, I'm Gina.
This is my husband...

416
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:50,231
Chris! Chris.
It's an unusual name.

417
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:54,442
Hi, I'm Chris' son, Bill.
I'm his son from his first marriage.

418
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:58,234
- My, uh, mom's dead.
- Oh.

419
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,404
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,705
I guess we'll be seeing
a lot more of you then.

421
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:06,303
Yes! That would be lovely.
We'd like that, wouldn't we?

422
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,757
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We'll have drinks...

423
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,961
and dinner maybe.

424
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:13,237
Maybe we'll even have a party.
You know, what the hell?

425
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,871
- Sure.
- That'll be great.

426
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,707
- Really like that, wouldn't you, honey?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

427
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:20,627
We're gonna leave
you guys alone here.

428
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,596
- Nice to meet you and we're
gonna go home. - Good-bye.

429
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:25,274
- So long.
- See ya. Bye-bye.

430
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:28,242
<i>- Come on, Archie.
- That's a nice mustache.</i>

431
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,350
<i>- You had that long?
- A long time. Most of my life, really.</i>

432
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:35,582
<i>- You had that for a while.
- Billy, please. Honey.</i>

433
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:39,472
Okay, so, uh, we've been
here, what, five minutes?

434
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:42,786
I usually wait two or three days before I
introduce myself to the people I'm staking out.

435
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:45,237
I'm sorry, okay?
It will not happen again.

436
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:48,440
I will keep him in the house and I'm
sorry about blanking on your name.

437
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:52,904
Blanking on my name. Hello, my name
is Gina. This is my husband, duh!

438
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,726
- That's really not nice. Do you know that?
- Mom, Dad!

439
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,408
<i>- Please don't fight in front of me. It's very upsetting.
- What, you think this is funny?</i>

440
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:59,802
It's not my dog.
This assignment gets blown,

441
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,201
it's not my butt,
it's Archie's butt.

442
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,931
Good point.

443
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:08,482
Hello, this is Chris.
Is Mari...

444
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:14,140
<i>Hola, es Chris.
Es Maria en casa?</i>

445
00:37:13,974 --> 00:37:18,206
<i>Well, would you tell...
Diga Maria se llama?</i>

446
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,731
<i>Si. No, no, no.
Momento.</i>

447
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:24,790
<i>Um, dos, uh, cero,
uh, seis,</i>

448
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:26,719
<i>uh, siete, uh...</i>

449
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,678
<i>Uno, dos, tres, quatro,
cinqo, seis, siete...</i>

450
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:30,630
<i>- Ocho.
- Ocho.</i>

451
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:33,082
<i>- Dos, cero, seis, siete, ocho, ocho.
- Okay, dos, cero, seis...</i>

452
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:37,244
<i>- Shut up!
- Dos, cero, seis, siete, ocho, ocho.</i>

453
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:40,577
<i>Dos, cero, seis,
siete, ocho, ocho.</i>

454
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,992
<i>- Gracious.
-</i>

455
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:47,833
<i>Senor. Pendejo.
Cuidado.</i>

456
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:51,432
- So what'd she say?
- She wasn't home.

457
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,318
- Yeah? Try work?
- She wasn't there either.

458
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,252
- Well, she's probably just out.
- Yeah? Where?

459
00:37:57,204 --> 00:38:00,537
- Oh, shopping or something. How do I know?
- She's with another guy.

460
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:02,936
<i>- How do you know that?
- You told me.</i>

461
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,835
- Hello, I was kidding.
- I'm gonna find out.

462
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:09,738
Wait for Mommy, honey.
Good boy.

463
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:12,211
<i>- You're acting like a madman.
- I'll be back.</i>

464
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,306
- Look, we are on a job.
- I'm just gonna ask her if she's seeing somebody.

465
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,157
- I am telling you as a friend, don't do this.
- I'm gonna tell you as a friend,

466
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:19,041
<i>don't do this.</i>

467
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,933
No-no! No!

468
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:25,662
<i>Wait, I need that car!
Wait a second!</i>

469
00:38:25,618 --> 00:38:29,679
<i>Wait, wait! Wait! Wait!</i>

470
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,912
<i>Tell me about it later?</i>

471
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:46,365
Hmm.

472
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:50,159
Sir, excuse me.

473
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:56,778
Tony, where ya goin'?

474
00:38:56,688 --> 00:39:00,055
They, uh, couldn't
identify her body.

475
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:04,444
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, without confirmation we're nervous.

476
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:06,964
- You want me to get confirmation?
- What we want is...

477
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,295
reassurance that the job
you were paid for... was done.

478
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,691
- You know she's alive?
- We don't know she isn't.

479
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:15,385
- You know the situation that puts us in.
- I'm gonna say it again.

480
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:19,439
- What are you saying? Do you want the money back?
- Tony, Tony.

481
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:24,713
You misunderstand me.
Money is not the issue here. Trust is.

482
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,222
That's why we came to you with this
very important piece of business.

483
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:33,581
And Tony, we have every confidence you'll
do the job that was entrusted to you.

484
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:37,474
Okay?

485
00:39:40,718 --> 00:39:44,654
- Oh, makin' dinner?
- Yes, I am. Love cooking.

486
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:47,048
- Mmm, looks good.
- Thank you very much.

487
00:39:48,781 --> 00:39:51,807
- It's late. Maria should be home by now.
- Maybe.

488
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,419
- Why don't you try calling her again?
- It's too late.

489
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,975
She's probably married by now.
I have to get her a gift.

490
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:01,803
<i>Did you know she asked me
to be her maid of honor?</i>

491
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,335
<i>So... when are we gonna
invite them over for drinks?</i>

492
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:11,833
- Ah, Bill?
- Yes, Chris?

493
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:14,451
Did I just hear you suggest that we
invite the neighbors over for drinks,

494
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,381
the very people that
we're here to stake out?

495
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:21,282
- Why, no, Chris. I would never do such a thing.
- Good to know, Bill!

496
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:25,359
The reason that I thought is because
it's simply a more expedient way...

497
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:27,420
of finding out whether or not
they've heard anything about Delano.

498
00:40:27,403 --> 00:40:29,871
And how do you expect us
to go about doing that? I know!

499
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:33,862
Maybe we could just ask them if they
have any friends in protective custody.

500
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,035
<i>It was not my idea. You happen to
be the one who invited them over.</i>

501
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,633
- I did not!
- You certainly did invite them!

502
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:42,384
- Not! Not!
- You went, Yes!

503
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:44,504
- Not! Not!
- Yes! Yes! Yes, you did!

504
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,220
<i>You said as clear as day, "Why
don't you come over for drinks?"</i>

505
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:50,510
<i>- Oh, now!
- "Maybe for dinner! Heck! Let's have a party!"</i>

506
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,069
- That's what you said! Yes. Is that what he said?
- No, no, no.

507
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,467
- Technically yes.
- "Technically"?

508
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,663
You should have defended me
on the mustache thing.

509
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,101
I didn't mean it, okay?
I was lying!

510
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:07,184
You know, I had no intention of inviting
them over here for drinks or anything else.

511
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,844
Let's just put it down to the fact
that I'm a bad neighbor, all right?

512
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,564
As soon as they understand that,
everyone will get along fine.

513
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,059
- That's good. What is that?
- Hummus.

514
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:20,551
- What-us?
- Hummus.

515
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,784
Some sliced vegetables,
a side of hummus. A hummus-side!

516
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,780
Oh, that's funny.

517
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:33,668
<i>Hello?</i>

518
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,542
I can't believe you've never
seen the show before.

519
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,653
All right, now,
which one is "Stimpy"?

520
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,405
Stimpy's the cat
and Ren is the Chihuahua.

521
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:44,617
- You idiot!
- And which one is "Stinky"?

522
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,713
Stinky is not a regular on the show.
Stinky just appears every now and again...

523
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,087
Oh, so the bodily functions
don't appear every day?

524
00:41:50,054 --> 00:41:53,546
No, it's like a guest-starring bodily
function. Sometimes it's rotting teeth.

525
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,775
- Sometimes it's farts.
- Where have I been?

526
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:59,810
You know this is the end of Western
civilization as we know it, don't you?

527
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,743
- I got the tap in.
- Good-bye.

528
00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:20,632
Hey, I'm not just
a piece of meat, you know.

529
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:53,402
<i>11.58 a.m.
Mrs. O'Hara goes peepee.</i>

530
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:58,935
Do you have to go peepee?
Hmm? I bet you do.

531
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:02,842
Well, you should have thought about
that before we left for the island.

532
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:07,668
No! Chris! Don't take the car.

533
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:09,514
You'll kill
your... self!

534
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:33,768
- Nice steady stream.
No penile obstructions.

535
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:43,609
<i>3.58 a.m.
Mr. O'Hara goes peepee.</i>

536
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:52,828
Two peepees in one night. You people
are gonna give me high blood pressure.

537
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:23,456
<i>What is it, Archie? What is it?</i>

538
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:34,171
<i>What is so important at...</i>

539
00:44:34,075 --> 00:44:37,169
4:41 in the morning?

540
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,243
Come on, Brian, Pam,
talk to me.

541
00:44:40,187 --> 00:44:42,747
<i>Is it Delano?</i>

542
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:49,991
No, Bill,
it's not Delano.

543
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:53,042
It's diarrhea.

544
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:58,822
- You know all about diarrhea,
don't you, Arch?

545
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:02,773
I bet you get it when someone gives
you a nice big piece of chocolate.

546
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:05,809
Come here. Come here.

547
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,323
Oooh!

548
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,606
Oooh!

549
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,291
<i>Get off Mommy's bed.</i>

550
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,301
- Hurry up, hurry up. Come on, let's go!
- What, what?

551
00:45:35,288 --> 00:45:37,552
- Do you want to be part of this stakeout or not?
- Okay.

552
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:41,486
Come on. You have got to follow him!
He might be going to meet Delano.

553
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:44,835
Let's go! And I'm injured!
Come on, take the dog!

554
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:47,159
Get the dog!
Archie!

555
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:58,282
Get up
or move over.

556
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,232
They had a lot to talk about
at 4:00 in the morning.

557
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:05,326
<i>I think we should
put in a bug.</i>

558
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:13,043
Mr. O'Hara went for a jog.
I told her to follow him.

559
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:17,475
<i>You told her to follow him?</i>

560
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:20,129
Call 9-1-1.

561
00:46:24,597 --> 00:46:27,361
Good, Archie.
Good boy.

562
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:45,911
<i>All right, doin'okay.
Slow down for Mommy, Archie.</i>

563
00:46:47,315 --> 00:46:51,945
All right.

564
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,490
Oh. Oh, God. Oh.

565
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:13,433
Archie, no.
Mommy can't go, Archie.

566
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:17,054
Archie! Archie!

567
00:47:16,977 --> 00:47:19,707
<i>Okay, good boy.
Let Mommy rest.</i>

568
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,540
No, Archie!

569
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,531
No, not the bunny,
Archie.

570
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:32,718
<i>No, no, Archie. Archie!
Leave the bunny!</i>

571
00:47:32,657 --> 00:47:37,424
<i>No! No!
Aaah!</i>

572
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:58,178
Ah!

573
00:48:00,718 --> 00:48:03,812
<i>Ah! A little
gardening action, huh?</i>

574
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:07,455
<i>Love that gardening action.
What have we got, peas and carrots?</i>

575
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,622
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah. Just...
There you go. Get those weeds.</i>

576
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:16,214
Get that... Turn around.
Turn around.

577
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,641
Yes, get that weed.
Yes!

578
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:23,474
<i>Yeah.
Brian's home.</i>

579
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:32,008
No, I'll do that for you.
Ah! Oh!

580
00:48:31,948 --> 00:48:34,815
<i>Feel better, huh?</i>

581
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:46,222
Where's Gina?

582
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,739
- All right, slowly.
- Okay.

583
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:02,021
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

584
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:06,431
- I got you.
- Okay. Ow.

585
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:09,113
Come on, Archie.

586
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:12,400
- Okay, here we go. You all right?
- Oh, yes, thank you, Frank.

587
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,130
- No problem.
- This ended up being such a joy.

588
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:19,807
- What happened?
- Oh, I sprained my ankle. I'm fine.

589
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:23,522
Hi, I'm Frank Sutter.
You must be Gina's father.

590
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:27,918
Yep! Yep!
That's exactly who I am.

591
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:31,046
<i>By cracky.
Pa, Pa Kettle!</i>

592
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:35,251
Oh, oh, my God!
I've fallen and I can't get up!

593
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:38,409
- Daddy? Stop it!
- Oh, you broke my Depends.

594
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:41,940
- Take care of that ankle. I gotta go.
- How about some lemonade?

595
00:49:41,864 --> 00:49:46,233
Frank, Frank! Don't go!
You can help me eat!

596
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,387
<i>- No, no, no, Frank. Frank!
- You can hold the utensil...</i>

597
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,538
<i>You spineless, selfish maggot!</i>

598
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:55,571
Telephone.

599
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,686
I heard it!
Geez!

600
00:49:57,671 --> 00:49:59,696
- Police work!
- Yes, I'm not deaf!

601
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:02,782
- Oh, the pain must be excruciating.
- Just shut your trap!

602
00:50:02,727 --> 00:50:04,991
- I ran my ass all over town for you!
- Shush, shush, quiet!

603
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:06,901
- Hello?
- Pam? It's Kate.

604
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:09,651
- Hi! How are ya?
- Oh, not too good.

605
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,975
- What's the matter?
- Larry and I are getting divorced.

606
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:17,730
- I needed to talk to someone.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

607
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:21,039
- Are you okay? Are you at the house?
- Yeah.

608
00:50:20,966 --> 00:50:25,767
- I'm sorry, Pam.
- Hey, don't be sorry. Where's Larry?

609
00:50:25,638 --> 00:50:28,903
He left. I don't know.
I think he went to Henry's.

610
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:33,798
<i>- Are the kids with you?
- No, they're staying with my parents for the week.</i>

611
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:38,299
<i>- Kate, are you and Larry still seeing that counselor?
- No.</i>

612
00:50:38,277 --> 00:50:41,212
<i>- Oh!
- Pam, I don't want to make it work anymore.</i>

613
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:45,150
<i>I'm sick of making it work. Larry's
a son-of-a-bitch. And I hate him.</i>

614
00:50:45,061 --> 00:50:48,758
Will Larry and Kate stay together
or will they get divorced?

615
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:52,237
Shh, shh, shh!
Please! Larry's a pig!

616
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:54,496
Oh, and Kate's
an angel, right?

617
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:59,770
Kate is a woman; Larry is a man.
Need I say more? I rest my case.

618
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:04,022
This is really fabulous. I mean this
whole thing of being able to hear.

619
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:06,467
I feel a teeny bit guilty,
but I'm really enjoying it.

620
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:08,699
<i>Don't go native on me...</i>

621
00:51:08,675 --> 00:51:10,802
- Aaah!
- Get down.

622
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:14,223
What? What?

623
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:16,945
<i>Get down.</i>

624
00:51:20,034 --> 00:51:22,264
Chris!
What happened?

625
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,711
Somebody's out there.

626
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:30,685
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I hate this part. Chris! Bill!

627
00:51:33,185 --> 00:51:36,951
<i>- What do you see?
- I don't know!</i>

628
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:46,347
I'm gonna circle
around back.

629
00:51:57,184 --> 00:52:01,018
Cover me.
I'm taking a bath.

630
00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:15,389
<i>Hello? Hello!</i>

631
00:52:15,295 --> 00:52:19,288
Hi! I just rented the house next
door. My name is Chris Lecce.

632
00:52:19,198 --> 00:52:23,760
Yeah, I saw you yesterday.
I'm Barbara Burnside.

633
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:26,171
Did you lose a baseball?

634
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,975
What did it break?

635
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:32,327
<i>- A window.
- Kitchen window?</i>

636
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:36,657
Ronnie!
Ronnie!

637
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:40,672
He always hides when he thinks he's
in for it. This is his responsibility.

638
00:52:40,573 --> 00:52:42,700
It's really no big deal.

639
00:52:42,685 --> 00:52:46,177
Do you mind
coming with me, please?

640
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:06,031
- Phone! Somebody get the...
Somebody get the phone!

641
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,148
<i>Spread a little lovin'
and we'll keep movin'on</i>

642
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:11,606
Somethin' always happens
whenever we're together

643
00:53:11,577 --> 00:53:14,603
We get a happy feelin'
when we're singing a song

644
00:53:14,553 --> 00:53:17,283
Travellin' around there's
a song that we're singin'

645
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:20,642
Uh-uh
Come on, get happy

646
00:53:20,568 --> 00:53:22,763
<i>- Danny got Reuben
to sell our songs</i>

647
00:53:26,776 --> 00:53:32,237
- Somebody get the phone!
I'm sleeping!

648
00:53:34,455 --> 00:53:37,549
- Yeah?
- Could I speak to Det. Lecce, please?

649
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:39,929
- Maria?
- Bill?

650
00:53:39,895 --> 00:53:41,863
Yeah.
Where are you?

651
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:45,408
- I'm at my mother's.
- Chris told me what happened.

652
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:47,268
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

653
00:53:47,254 --> 00:53:49,722
My partner
misses you.

654
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:52,416
Is he there?

655
00:53:52,374 --> 00:53:55,468
Yeah, um... Look, no matter
how much of a jerk he can be,

656
00:53:55,414 --> 00:54:00,044
and believe me,
he can be a jerk, I know,

657
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:04,886
he absolutely, totally
adores you and loves you.

658
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:08,921
Listen, you don't have to tell me,
but, um... is there another guy?

659
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:10,846
Did he tell you
that was the reason?

660
00:54:10,837 --> 00:54:13,271
Oh, no, no!
I just thought, maybe...

661
00:54:13,237 --> 00:54:18,106
You know, I start talking
and... Forget it.

662
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:20,873
- I'll, I'll get him, okay? I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

663
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,414
<i>Chris!</i>

664
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:37,367
I don't believe this.

665
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,993
<i>There's a song
that we're singin'</i>

666
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:45,222
<i>Come on, get happy</i>

667
00:54:47,603 --> 00:54:51,004
Hi, um...
I can't find him.

668
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:56,733
Where is he?

669
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:59,920
- I-I'll have him call you.
- Where did he go?

670
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:04,659
The funniest thing happened. This, uh,
baseball went through this window...

671
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,126
- and he had to take it next door because he thought...
- Bill. Bill.

672
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:10,943
No, don't bother,
okay?

673
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:12,863
Right.

674
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:14,817
Bye.

675
00:55:21,809 --> 00:55:23,868
I just wanna
get some sleep!

676
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:30,149
Phone!

677
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:36,062
Telephone!

678
00:55:36,048 --> 00:55:40,109
- Hi, you've reached
the O'Hara residence.

679
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:42,985
- We can't come to the phone, so please leave a message.
- They're not home.

680
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:45,555
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God, they're not home.

681
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:48,454
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know where they are! Where the hell were you?

682
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:51,766
- Where the hell were you? - I-I was
returning the baseball, that's where.

683
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:53,889
- Well, I was taking a bath. Excuse me!
- Aw, geez!

684
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:56,737
<i>What the hell is goin' on? I was tryin'
to sleep! Can't you keep from yelling...</i>

685
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,917
Here, take the equipment.
We're puttin' in a bug.

686
00:55:58,894 --> 00:56:00,953
- We're puttin' in a bug.
- Putting in a bug.

687
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,423
Fine.

688
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,698
Chris!

689
00:57:08,682 --> 00:57:11,776
<i>Chris. They're coming.</i>

690
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:15,657
Bill.
Bill!

691
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:18,291
Come on,
come on.

692
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,671
The bag!

693
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,590
They're coming.

694
00:58:11,878 --> 00:58:13,812
Hi, there.

695
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:16,232
- Hi!
- Oh, look, it's, uh...

696
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:18,132
- Gina.
- Gina!

697
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:21,382
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by...

698
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:23,582
here...
at your house...

699
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:26,652
today to...
invite you to dinner.

700
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:29,361
I was in the shower,
in fact, and I thought to myself...

701
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:31,410
those people next door are lovely,
why not some dinner?

702
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:33,330
- Can I take that for you?
- No, no.

703
00:58:33,316 --> 00:58:35,614
Please?
lt'd be my pleasure.

704
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:43,336
<i>Yes!</i>

705
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:51,363
Yes, isn't it great? And I was
thinking, perhaps, dinner sometime soon?

706
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,170
- Like, when?
- Like, uh...

707
00:58:53,156 --> 00:58:56,887
I was thinking that...
Like, tonight.

708
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:59,932
<i>- Yes.
- Yes?</i>

709
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:03,641
Yes. Thank God. All right, then.

710
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:19,088
What's happenin', Tom?

711
00:59:19,074 --> 00:59:21,907
- Do I know you?
- Not important.

712
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,951
<i>- What do you want?
- I want you to get back in the car.</i>

713
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,929
- What?
- We need to talk.

714
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:27,855
- Get lost.
- Whoa, wait a second. Hold it.

715
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:30,002
You're making my life
very difficult.

716
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:34,012
I need to know where she is
and you need to tell me.

717
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,855
You stupid
son-of-a-bitch.

718
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:39,470
What the hell are you doin' here?
Are you crazy?

719
00:59:39,393 --> 00:59:42,191
We can still
get in the car.

720
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,704
I don't know
where the hell she is.

721
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:47,573
When I find out,
I'll call.

722
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,886
Good.
Thank you.

723
00:59:52,224 --> 00:59:55,091
Keep the hell
away from me.

724
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,508
Tommy!

725
00:59:57,472 --> 01:00:00,100
Just remember,
I do know where you are.

726
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:01,998
<i>- Okay?
- Okay, uh...</i>

727
01:00:01,984 --> 01:00:05,010
<i>I have a home security business.
I started it ten years ago.</i>

728
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:07,393
<i>We broke up after two years of
living together. Her name was Louise.</i>

729
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,226
<i>I have one son, Bill, by my
first marriage. She's dead.</i>

730
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:12,108
She wanted to get married;
I didn't. We should trade.

731
01:00:12,094 --> 01:00:14,028
You shouldn't
have any problem remembering this.

732
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,380
- Ha-ha-ha. Did you know that you
were illegitimate? - Thank God.

733
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:19,478
Now, my first wife's name
was, uh...

734
01:00:19,422 --> 01:00:22,823
- Cheryl.
- Ah! Don't help me! Cheryl, it was Cheryl.

735
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,877
<i>Sometimes I really
miss Mom, don't you?</i>

736
01:00:24,862 --> 01:00:26,796
Just don't take any longer
in there than you have to.

737
01:00:26,782 --> 01:00:30,343
<i>- Put the bug in and get the hell out.
- Home before midnight, Pop.</i>

738
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,204
Forty-five minutes,
that's all you're gonna get.

739
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,590
Then I'm gonna puke on the table;
they're gonna come home.

740
01:00:34,558 --> 01:00:36,492
- Forty-five minutes, check your watch.
- Hey, hey, hey!

741
01:00:36,477 --> 01:00:39,241
- Don't you even think of touching my hors d'oeuvres.
- Hey, stop that!

742
01:00:39,197 --> 01:00:42,394
- Let me tell you something, Miss Assistant District Attorney.
- Do not use that tone with me.

743
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:45,598
If this assignment gets blown,
I want to go on record right now...

744
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:48,900
that this is the most stupid,
dim-witted, idiotic,

745
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:53,458
moronic piece of putrefied garbage that I
have ever, in my entire professional career,

746
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,774
<i>ever had the displeasure
of being involved with.</i>

747
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,470
- Really? And?
- Really.

748
01:00:58,428 --> 01:01:02,728
<i>Re... And I don't like the panties
hanging on the rod!</i>

749
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:06,521
Excuse me, Detective,
but the dryer was not working.

750
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:09,487
You pathetic
Steven Seagal wanna-be.

751
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:11,562
<i>Walkin'around all dressed in black.</i>

752
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:14,641
You think it's funny? You're even
worse than he is, do ya know that?

753
01:01:14,586 --> 01:01:16,850
You're just a flunky;
you're a sidekick.

754
01:01:16,827 --> 01:01:19,261
That's what you are.
He's Fred, you're Barney.

755
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:21,525
He's Johnny Carson,
you're Ed McMahon!

756
01:01:21,499 --> 01:01:25,435
- That's it!
Nobody calls me Ed McMahon!

757
01:01:25,338 --> 01:01:28,398
Here is my gun,
here is my badge...

758
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:30,644
<i>- and here is me quitting!
- Me too.</i>

759
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:34,019
<i>- You can't quit. Oh, yeah, right.
- Watch us.</i>

760
01:01:33,945 --> 01:01:37,176
- What are you gonna do, leave me here alone?
- Yes!

761
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:39,742
All right, I'm sorry!
I am sorry.

762
01:01:39,705 --> 01:01:42,435
- Really?
- I'm sorry about this whole thing.

763
01:01:42,393 --> 01:01:46,989
I'm sorry that you feel this assignment is
beneath you. I am sorry I brought my dog.

764
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:50,501
I am sorry that I was taking a bath when I
should have been watching the O'Hara's house.

765
01:01:50,424 --> 01:01:54,360
But most of all...
I am sorry we are not getting along!

766
01:01:54,264 --> 01:01:56,994
So if you wanna leave,
just leave!

767
01:01:56,952 --> 01:01:59,887
This is not working.

768
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:01,766
You just go
and I'll cover for you.

769
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:06,052
I'll say, maybe, that one of your alarms
went off and you had to go, okay? Just go.

770
01:02:05,944 --> 01:02:08,777
You think that we're gonna be
guilty and we're gonna stay.

771
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:11,492
I have a job
that I have to do...

772
01:02:11,447 --> 01:02:15,645
and you guys can just decide
what's right for you to do, okay?

773
01:02:15,543 --> 01:02:17,943
Oh, look at her.
She's doing the shoulder thing.

774
01:02:17,911 --> 01:02:21,677
- We're bein' had, right? We're outta here!
- Absolutely.

775
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:34,877
<i>Gina...</i>

776
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:38,134
They're here!
I knew you guys would stay.

777
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:41,005
Bill, I want you to go in there
and put in the bug. You know why?

778
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:44,612
You're the best bugger I ever met. Chris,
we have been married for five years.

779
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:46,899
I love you;
you love me.

780
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:49,633
- This is gonna be fabulous!
- Wait, wait, wait.

781
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:52,023
<i>- Be right there! Gotta freshen up.
- Where are you going?</i>

782
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:55,288
- Forty-five minutes.
- Just a... Just a minute.

783
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:58,122
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. Where are you...

784
01:02:58,068 --> 01:03:02,437
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I got myself hooked into this one.

785
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,088
- Goddamn it. Hi!
- Hi!

786
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,179
- Here. Welcome.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

787
01:03:10,164 --> 01:03:12,689
That's very nice. Thanks a lot.
Hi, glad to see you.

788
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:14,593
- Hi, good to see you.
- Thanks for having us.

789
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:17,639
Come on in. What would you, uh...
What would you like to drink?

790
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:21,023
- Cheryl will be down in just one second.
- Uh, Cheryl?

791
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:25,213
Cheryl. Cheryl, my, my, um...

792
01:03:25,107 --> 01:03:29,203
<i>Sorry. Cheryl is the name
of my first dead wife...</i>

793
01:03:29,107 --> 01:03:31,302
<i>- Ah.
- Sometimes, I call Gina Cheryl.</i>

794
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:33,443
Please, don't tell her
I said that because it's, uh...

795
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:35,724
No, not a word.

796
01:03:35,698 --> 01:03:37,962
Please.
What can I get you to drink?

797
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:40,270
- Oh, uh, scotch and water for me, thanks.
- Okeydoke.

798
01:03:40,242 --> 01:03:43,473
- I'll take a vodka if you've got it. Straight up?
- You got it.

799
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:46,811
<i>- Honey? Pam and Brian are here.
- I'll be right there.</i>

800
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:50,332
<i>- Would you like something to drink, dear?
- I'll have the usual, honey.</i>

801
01:03:50,257 --> 01:03:52,225
The usual.

802
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:56,428
His first dead wife?

803
01:03:56,401 --> 01:04:00,201
I told you I didn't wanna be here to begin
with. I hope we brought 'em cheap wine.

804
01:04:37,806 --> 01:04:39,740
Dude.

805
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:52,881
Scotch and water.

806
01:04:52,782 --> 01:04:56,081
And vodka straight up.

807
01:04:56,013 --> 01:04:59,449
And, uh...
The usual, the usual.

808
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:02,001
Oh, Jesus.

809
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:07,403
Ah!
Gin and tonic.

810
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:12,608
Okay. Gin...

811
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,395
and tonic.

812
01:05:16,972 --> 01:05:20,567
<i>- Hello, how are you? Lovely of you to...
- Hi, how are you? Fine.</i>

813
01:05:20,491 --> 01:05:22,789
- Do you like chili?
- Chili?

814
01:05:22,763 --> 01:05:24,697
- Yes?
- I love chili. Oh, yeah, I love it.

815
01:05:24,683 --> 01:05:27,447
- All right. Here we have scotch for Brian...
- Oh, thank you.

816
01:05:27,404 --> 01:05:29,668
- and a vodka straight for Pam,
- Thanks.

817
01:05:29,643 --> 01:05:31,770
<i>and a gin for Gina.</i>

818
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:34,451
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Aren't you drinking, Chris?

819
01:05:34,411 --> 01:05:36,971
No, no, not anymore.
Too many funny hats.

820
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:42,157
<i>Oh, honey, honey.</i>

821
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,650
- Oh, honey. I'm...
Did I make that too strong?

822
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:47,052
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Oh, oh, I'm really...

823
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:48,952
<i>Honey.</i>

824
01:05:48,938 --> 01:05:51,065
- Should I try again?
- Thank you. No, no, no, sweetheart.

825
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:52,983
- Okay. Okay.
- It's fine, really.

826
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:55,233
So tell me, uh...

827
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:57,439
- Where's your son, uh... Bill.
- Bill.

828
01:05:57,417 --> 01:06:00,181
<i>- Bill! Actually, he went out for a little while.
- Bill, yes.</i>

829
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:03,164
Yeah, he should be back
in about, um, 37 minutes.

830
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:12,471
How long have you two
lived here?

831
01:06:12,457 --> 01:06:14,220
- Five years.
- Yeah, about five years.

832
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:16,480
Cute, yes.

833
01:06:16,457 --> 01:06:18,925
<i>Actually, we just spend the summer
and the weekends here.</i>

834
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:22,051
- Oh, the summers here are incredible!
- You'll love it.

835
01:06:21,992 --> 01:06:23,857
You, uh, keep a place
in the city?

836
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:25,781
- Um-hmm. Lake Washington. -
Um-hmm. We love being near the water.

837
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:27,701
- We spent ten years in Las Vegas.
- Oh!

838
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:31,350
<i>- Vegas! Really? Honey, they're from Vegas.
- Yeah.</i>

839
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:33,933
- Uh, would you like another drink?
- Yes.

840
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:36,159
<i>- Pam?
- I would love one. A drink would be great.</i>

841
01:06:36,135 --> 01:06:39,036
- Honey?
- No, no. Thank you.

842
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:43,684
Bill?

843
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:48,212
Bill?

844
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,604
Bill?
God!

845
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:56,522
You know, sometimes
it is so peaceful here that...

846
01:06:56,454 --> 01:07:00,185
we... never...

847
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:07,943
Honey?

848
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:13,695
Drinks! Ha!

849
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,791
- Well, this certainly looks delicious.
- Thank you so much.

850
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:19,986
- Wonderful.
- Brian was telling us before that they're originally from Chicago.

851
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,173
<i>- Oh, Chicago.
- Chicago.</i>

852
01:08:23,104 --> 01:08:25,971
<i>- Oh, Chicago! We love Chicago.
- Oh, really?</i>

853
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,854
<i>Well, you can have it.</i>

854
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,899
<i>Gina, this all looks
absolutely delicious.</i>

855
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:31,856
<i>- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yes, honey.</i>

856
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,137
- Sure.
- Sure.

857
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,475
<i>The chili's fabulous.
Oh, I bet it is. It looks...</i>

858
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,125
- How long have you and Chris been married?
- Five years.

859
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,809
- But you know Chris was married before.
- Oh, I know.

860
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:52,362
He must have started young.
Bill's, what, about late 20s?

861
01:08:52,286 --> 01:08:54,220
- Thirty-two. Um-hmm.
- Thirty-two?

862
01:08:54,206 --> 01:08:56,140
- How old's Chris?
- Forty-five.

863
01:08:59,006 --> 01:09:01,497
Did I say 45?

864
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,701
- I meant 55. Chris is fifty...
- Oh!

865
01:09:04,638 --> 01:09:08,074
- He's the speed limit. That's
exactly what he is. - Fifty-five!

866
01:09:07,997 --> 01:09:09,931
- The big five-five.
- Yes! No kidding.

867
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:11,851
- That is amazing. I can't believe he's 55.
- Really?

868
01:09:11,837 --> 01:09:14,135
- He doesn't look 55, does he?
- No, I thought he was much younger.

869
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:18,011
- Actually, it came a surprise to me, too, at first.
- I'll bet it did.

870
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:21,080
Yes, it did.
Brian, how's the chili?

871
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:24,218
<i>- Yes, it... I'm...
- Yes?</i>

872
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:26,454
<i>- You must save room for meat loaf.
- Oh.</i>

873
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:29,660
- It's armadillo.
- Yes.

874
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:32,224
<i>- Pam? These are corn flakes.
- Yeah?</i>

875
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:34,714
<i>- Oh. Get outta here.
- Yes. They're corn flakes.</i>

876
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:37,619
<i>Not much
of an armadillo eater, but I'll try it.</i>

877
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:40,863
No, no, Brian, it's meat loaf.
It's just shaped that way.

878
01:09:49,883 --> 01:09:51,817
Bill.

879
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,416
Bill.

880
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:05,132
Bill?

881
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:17,678
Bill.

882
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,836
Oh! Oh!

883
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,751
Shit!

884
01:10:28,536 --> 01:10:31,369
<i>You know, Brian and I...</i>

885
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,312
<i>- have been married almost ten years.
- No!</i>

886
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:37,233
<i>- I can hardly believe it.
- That is just so wonderful.</i>

887
01:10:37,176 --> 01:10:40,270
<i>- Thank you.
- You know, marriage isn't always easy.</i>

888
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:42,446
Come on. Ours hasn't been
that bad, has it?

889
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:45,153
- Oh, honey, I wasn't talking about ours.
- Okay. All right.

890
01:10:45,111 --> 01:10:47,705
- We have a couple of friends who are splitting up.
- Oh.

891
01:10:47,671 --> 01:10:50,606
For the umpteenth time. I don't know
why they just don't get it over with.

892
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:52,610
I'm sure if it was that easy
they would.

893
01:10:52,599 --> 01:10:54,897
- It's never that easy when kids are involved.
- Excuse me,

894
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:59,035
but it's my opinion that it's harder on the
kids when people like that stay together.

895
01:10:58,935 --> 01:11:02,837
- But you have to try, honey.
- Well, of course, dear, you have to try.

896
01:11:02,742 --> 01:11:05,267
They should try.
But if it's not working,

897
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:07,673
nothing they do is gonna
make it right, now is it?

898
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:11,335
<i>Beside, Kate is a real bitch. I wouldn't
be married to her for ten seconds.</i>

899
01:11:11,254 --> 01:11:16,089
- Kate is not that bad.
- Kate is a friend of yours, and I'd rather not get into it.

900
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:19,894
Far be it for me to interrupt, however,
it's never just one person's fault, is it?

901
01:11:19,798 --> 01:11:23,063
I'm sure Larry bears just
as much responsibility as Kate.

902
01:11:22,997 --> 01:11:27,058
Well, excuse me, but I've known Larry
longer than the both of you.

903
01:11:31,797 --> 01:11:34,664
You know
Kate and Larry?

904
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:39,049
Well, um... I don't
know them, actually, no.

905
01:11:38,932 --> 01:11:41,765
You've met them?

906
01:11:41,716 --> 01:11:44,810
Not exactly.

907
01:11:44,756 --> 01:11:48,487
- How do you not exactly meet somebody?
- Hmm?

908
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:06,977
Oh, honey!
Ha-ha.

909
01:12:06,898 --> 01:12:11,358
Oh, uh...
The bathroom faucet got all, uh...

910
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,686
You know, spritz me and I had
to change. So what did I miss?

911
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,545
Do you know
Kate and Larry Sawyer?

912
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:20,391
Kate and Larry Sawyer.

913
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:24,296
Uh, Kate and Larry Sawyer,
Kate and Larry Sawyer. Um.

914
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:27,202
Golly, honey, do I know
Kate and Larry Sawyer?

915
01:12:27,153 --> 01:12:30,953
No, sweetheart, you do not
but I do in my own special way...

916
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:32,833
and, honey,
I've decided to tell them.

917
01:12:32,817 --> 01:12:36,275
Oh, no. I don't think that
would be a good idea, dear.

918
01:12:36,209 --> 01:12:37,301
<i>- Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- No, no, no.</i>

919
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:40,230
<i>- No. No. No. No.
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.</i>

920
01:12:40,177 --> 01:12:43,374
Yes.

921
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:46,077
Pam, Brian...

922
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:48,364
I have the ability
to see things.

923
01:12:49,872 --> 01:12:53,137
I hate to say this.
Some people even say that I'm psychic.

924
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:56,529
<i>It's strange. Ideas, images,
thoughts, names just pop in my head.</i>

925
01:12:56,463 --> 01:12:59,762
Just before I was thinking
Larry, Kate Sawyer.

926
01:12:59,695 --> 01:13:02,755
I don't know how; I don't know
where. It's frightening, isn't it?

927
01:13:02,703 --> 01:13:05,934
<i>I can't even watch Jeopardy.
I know all the answers. It's crazy!</i>

928
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:07,964
It scares Chris, actually.
It really does.

929
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,920
He doesn't like me to talk about it.
Do you, honey?

930
01:13:10,862 --> 01:13:15,959
No, knock yourself out.

931
01:13:17,646 --> 01:13:20,911
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

932
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:24,043
You know, I've never met anyone
who could actually do it.

933
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,576
<i>- Oh, I don't do it,
it just sorta happens.</i>

934
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:29,306
Well, I've gotta do it.
Go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

935
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:32,424
- Hello?
- Chris?

936
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,563
- Maria?
- You called.

937
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:38,436
Yeah.
Hold on one second.

938
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:41,646
- Are you okay?
- Fine. You?

939
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,174
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

940
01:13:44,141 --> 01:13:46,905
I'm going back
to Veracruz.

941
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:49,193
- For how long?
- I've been offered a job.

942
01:13:49,164 --> 01:13:52,031
<i>Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute.</i>

943
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,881
<i>Are you talking about
permanently moving?</i>

944
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:58,491
I'm leaving Friday.

945
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:03,940
- Are you trying to kill me?
- No, I just want a life.

946
01:14:03,788 --> 01:14:06,757
I want kids and I'm sick
of hearing myself ask for it.

947
01:14:06,699 --> 01:14:09,759
Maria, how do I tell you that I
love you and make you believe it?

948
01:14:09,707 --> 01:14:11,334
<i>What do I say?</i>

949
01:14:11,339 --> 01:14:14,775
- Don't.
- No, no, no, just listen to me.

950
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,190
Maria...

951
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:21,861
l...
I wanna marry you.

952
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:24,468
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

953
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,951
I know you think I'm only saying
something that I think you wanna hear,

954
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:28,617
- but I really mean it.
- Chris, don't do it like this.

955
01:14:28,617 --> 01:14:31,211
Chris, don't do it like this.
Not on the phone like this!

956
01:14:31,178 --> 01:14:33,146
All right, it's not on the phone.
Bad idea, bad.

957
01:14:33,129 --> 01:14:37,031
Let's, let's start again,
all right? Just...

958
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:39,771
<i>I will do anything
I have to do.</i>

959
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:44,352
Anything at all, no matter how hard it
is. Except it's very hard now to talk.

960
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:50,217
I want to marry you.
I wanna marry you...

961
01:14:50,121 --> 01:14:53,557
<i>tonight.</i>

962
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,678
I'm willing to leave here.
We'll go to a justice of the peace.

963
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,510
- I gotta go.
- No, wait!

964
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,794
No, no, no, wait!
Aw...

965
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:08,968
I'm sensing...
you have been very stressed lately.

966
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:12,528
- Oh, you're right.
- Yes, I know, very stressed.

967
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:15,215
Something concerning...

968
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:18,504
Brian and another woman.

969
01:16:18,435 --> 01:16:22,531
Yes, Pam, I feel it.
It's... a woman from his past.

970
01:16:22,435 --> 01:16:24,460
- I don't know the nature of the relationship.
- Honey.

971
01:16:24,451 --> 01:16:27,113
- One second. It could be sexual, it may not.
- Honey, honey. Could l...

972
01:16:27,075 --> 01:16:29,100
- One second, sweetheart.
- No, no, honey.

973
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:31,025
- Honey, sweetheart, darling.
- It's someone that he... Wait.

974
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,570
- Yes?
- Honey, this is the first time...

975
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:36,974
the O'Haras have been over for dinner and I
think, maybe, it's not such a good idea that,

976
01:16:36,898 --> 01:16:39,924
you know, they think this kind
of thing happens all the time.

977
01:16:39,873 --> 01:16:44,207
- You know, you're right. I'm sorry. I really am.
- It's okay.

978
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:46,362
All right. Sweetheart,
was that Bill on the phone?

979
01:16:46,337 --> 01:16:48,965
- No, just some public opinion poll.
- I knew that.

980
01:16:48,929 --> 01:16:52,228
- I knew it was a public opinion poll.
- Excuse me. Pam?

981
01:16:52,161 --> 01:16:54,891
Honey, I've developed a bit of a
headache and I think we should be going.

982
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:58,182
- Thanks for having us over.
- Oh, no, you haven't had dessert yet.

983
01:16:58,112 --> 01:17:00,046
- No, no, no, we... No.
- Would you like some aspirin?

984
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,899
- Or some Motrin? Or Tylenol or Percodan?
- No. No. No.

985
01:17:02,849 --> 01:17:06,751
- Honey, please, let's go.
- Honey, I told you. The psychic thing flips people out.

986
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:09,750
- Was that what happened, Pam? Was it the psychic thing?
- Oh, no!

987
01:17:09,696 --> 01:17:12,358
Please, could I ask you,
just give us one more half hour.

988
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,514
- She's been working all day on this dessert.
- I have.

989
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:18,192
- You won't be sorry. One half hour more, okay?
- Please.

990
01:17:18,112 --> 01:17:20,171
- Okay, fine.
- All right. Great!

991
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:24,721
Let's move into the living room.
It is such a pleasure to know you two.

992
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,075
- Shh! Shh!
- What?

993
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,600
I heard him at the phone.
- So?

994
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:32,791
He said that he loved her
and wanted to marry her.

995
01:17:32,766 --> 01:17:34,927
I even know her name. Maria!

996
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:37,970
"Maria, I love you. Maria, I wanna
marry you." Just like the song.

997
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,116
- I was waitin' for him to start singin' and dancin'.
- Oh, my God.

998
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:43,851
This guy has got balls
this big.

999
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:46,070
- She calls right here, right under her nose.
- Oh!

1000
01:17:46,046 --> 01:17:48,947
Some psychic she is. Her own husband
is in love with a woman named Maria,

1001
01:17:48,893 --> 01:17:52,351
- and she doesn't even know it!
- I feel so sorry for her.

1002
01:17:52,285 --> 01:17:54,185
They are not psychic;
they're psychotic.

1003
01:17:54,173 --> 01:17:57,609
What kind of a woman makes an armadillo meat
loaf and God knows what was in those eggs.

1004
01:17:57,533 --> 01:17:59,467
- Pam.
- What?

1005
01:17:59,452 --> 01:18:02,580
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy killed
his first wife. We gotta get outta here.

1006
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:04,651
- Let's go.
- No! No, no, no, we...

1007
01:18:04,637 --> 01:18:07,731
<i>- Be right there!
- Knowing these two, they will bring the dessert to our house.</i>

1008
01:18:07,677 --> 01:18:10,737
- Listen, we'll sit down and eat fast.
- Fast, fast! Eat fast!

1009
01:18:10,684 --> 01:18:14,814
<i>- All we got's ice cream sandwiches.
- We'll tell 'em it's homemade.</i>

1010
01:18:14,716 --> 01:18:17,685
<i>- We need somethin' else.
- Reddi-Wip.</i>

1011
01:18:17,628 --> 01:18:21,223
Very good. It was a good cover
with the psychic thing.

1012
01:18:21,148 --> 01:18:23,343
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

1013
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:25,314
Thank you.
How'd you get all wet?

1014
01:18:25,308 --> 01:18:28,368
I snuck over to their house
looking for Bill.

1015
01:18:28,315 --> 01:18:30,249
- Yeah?
- And the sprinklers went off.

1016
01:18:30,235 --> 01:18:32,169
- Oh, God. Did you find him?
- No, he wasn't there.

1017
01:18:32,155 --> 01:18:34,123
- He wasn't there?
- No.

1018
01:18:34,106 --> 01:18:36,301
Give me that.

1019
01:18:36,282 --> 01:18:38,375
I wouldn't worry too much. We're
not gonna be invited over for dinner.

1020
01:18:38,362 --> 01:18:42,025
- They already think we're nuts.
- We're a perfectly normal couple. Go.

1021
01:18:41,946 --> 01:18:45,143
"I scream, you scream.
We all scream for ice cream."

1022
01:18:45,082 --> 01:18:47,016
- Great.
- Oh, thank you.

1023
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:49,766
- You're really gonna like this. It's a specialty.
- Oh, honey,

1024
01:18:49,721 --> 01:18:51,712
- Doesn't this look great?
- Oh, yeah, looks real good.

1025
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:54,902
Oh, mmm, this is wonderful. You're
gonna have to give me the recipe.

1026
01:18:54,841 --> 01:18:56,934
<i>- I will.
- Okay.</i>

1027
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,651
Oh, it's terrific.

1028
01:19:05,049 --> 01:19:08,746
<i>Mmm. Mmm!</i>

1029
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:13,745
Oh, God.
Headache, honey?

1030
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,483
<i>Honey, honey.</i>

1031
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,414
I think we'd better...

1032
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:20,232
- I think we're gonna go home.
- I think it's time for us to go. Thank you very much.

1033
01:19:20,183 --> 01:19:22,117
<i>- No! No, no, no!
- No, no, no.</i>

1034
01:19:22,103 --> 01:19:24,037
No, no, really,
we have to go.

1035
01:19:24,023 --> 01:19:27,186
No, really, we... I have
an early tee time tomorrow morning.

1036
01:19:27,127 --> 01:19:30,392
Thanks very much
for a very interesting evening.

1037
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:32,455
If you could just... If you
could just... If you could just...

1038
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,407
Oh, the hell with this.
I'm goin' out there to find Bill.

1039
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:36,951
Get your badge.
They'll never believe you're a cop.

1040
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:44,633
- Oh, my God.
- Did you call the police?

1041
01:19:44,598 --> 01:19:46,532
- No.
- Lu, you've gotta call the police.

1042
01:19:46,518 --> 01:19:49,612
If I tell the police
they'll take me back to testify.

1043
01:19:49,558 --> 01:19:53,289
- I have to leave.
- What about him? What are you gonna do with him?

1044
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:57,567
- I'll have to kill him.
- Hmm?

1045
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:00,688
<i>Brian, talk to her.</i>

1046
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,496
<i>- Shut up.
Wait. Lu, wait a minute.</i>

1047
01:20:03,445 --> 01:20:06,039
What do you mean? You're just gonna
kill him? That's it. You kill him?

1048
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:08,940
He came here to kill me.

1049
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:12,411
Shut up! Look, if he lives,
he'll tell them that you helped me.

1050
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,275
Then they're
comin' after you.

1051
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,990
Shut up!

1052
01:20:19,124 --> 01:20:21,558
Get up. Get up.
Come on.

1053
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:32,664
He's probably
havin' a beer somewhere.

1054
01:20:43,954 --> 01:20:45,854
Shit.

1055
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,333
Aaaaaaah!

1056
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,540
Try anything,
I'll shoot you. Get out.

1057
01:22:30,508 --> 01:22:32,874
Come on, get up.

1058
01:22:36,428 --> 01:22:40,023
I don't see them.

1059
01:22:39,947 --> 01:22:42,882
Goddamn it.
Must have turned off.

1060
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:46,058
- Come on, walk!
So how much was I worth, huh?

1061
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,964
$25,000? $30,000?
Huh?

1062
01:22:48,907 --> 01:22:50,841
Keep going.

1063
01:22:50,827 --> 01:22:53,762
You shouldn't have come after me.
You just shouldn't have come.

1064
01:22:53,706 --> 01:22:56,300
I wasn't gonna testify.

1065
01:22:56,266 --> 01:23:00,669
Don't stop! You don't do
anything unless I tell you.

1066
01:23:00,555 --> 01:23:02,750
Maybe you're the guy
that killed Michael. Huh?

1067
01:23:02,730 --> 01:23:04,960
Are you? Did you kill Michael?

1068
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,532
I bet you are,
you son-of-a-bitch!

1069
01:23:07,498 --> 01:23:10,228
I just bet you are.
You killed Michael, didn't you?

1070
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:12,484
Now I'm gonna kill you.
Get down!

1071
01:23:15,785 --> 01:23:19,380
If you believe in God, you
better pray for forgiveness now.

1072
01:23:19,305 --> 01:23:21,830
Because you got no time left.

1073
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:01,014
<i>Watch out!</i>

1074
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,090
Go get Bill!

1075
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:17,946
Hang on, Bill!

1076
01:24:43,683 --> 01:24:46,049
Ah! Okay!

1077
01:24:46,019 --> 01:24:48,180
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1078
01:24:48,164 --> 01:24:50,132
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1079
01:25:02,178 --> 01:25:04,646
Get away
from the dock!

1080
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:10,450
I'll get it!
I'm gonna get the car!

1081
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:15,951
- She okay? How about you?
- Yeah.

1082
01:25:15,938 --> 01:25:18,168
- I'm fine. Where's Bill?
- Up there.

1083
01:25:30,337 --> 01:25:33,067
<i>Ah!</i>

1084
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:50,139
Okay!
I got her!

1085
01:25:59,839 --> 01:26:02,205
Oo-ha!

1086
01:26:02,175 --> 01:26:05,076
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1087
01:26:22,494 --> 01:26:26,260
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Flight 610...</i>

1088
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:40,337
- Yep.
- They found her on one of those islands near Seattle.

1089
01:26:40,285 --> 01:26:42,344
Staying with some family
named O'Hara.

1090
01:26:42,332 --> 01:26:44,926
- She's agreed to testify, am I right?
- I don't know yet.

1091
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:46,826
<i>We just got the call
from Seattle.</i>

1092
01:26:46,812 --> 01:26:49,542
Don't worry about it. I'm catching
a plane; I'm bringin' her back.

1093
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:54,267
I need to know where she is right now.
Do you follow me? That woman...

1094
01:26:56,092 --> 01:26:58,253
That woman...
will not testify.

1095
01:26:58,235 --> 01:27:02,171
Yeah. I'll call
when I get there. Hey!

1096
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:08,585
Hello, Tony?

1097
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:11,540
Yeah.
We got work to do.

1098
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:20,424
<i>- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Dr. Gold, it's about Badham.</i>

1099
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:23,345
- So she's gonna be all right?
- Okay. A broken nose. She'll be fine.

1100
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:25,815
Thank you very much.

1101
01:27:28,314 --> 01:27:32,546
Miss Delano. Am I glad to see you.
I can't tell you...

1102
01:27:32,441 --> 01:27:35,342
what an experience this has been
for all of us down in Las Vegas.

1103
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:37,223
We were so relieved...

1104
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:39,643
when we learned that they had found
you and that you were all right.

1105
01:27:39,609 --> 01:27:42,976
Listen, I know that this has been...

1106
01:27:42,905 --> 01:27:46,068
Extremely traumatic for you,
but I'm here to assure you...

1107
01:27:46,009 --> 01:27:48,239
that every precaution
has been taken.

1108
01:27:48,216 --> 01:27:51,049
- We're gonna get you home safe.
- I have to see my friends first.

1109
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,992
Oh, the O'Hara's.
You know what?

1110
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:57,072
I think it would be safer if we just
went straight from here to the airport.

1111
01:27:57,016 --> 01:27:59,177
They don't even know
what happened to me last night.

1112
01:27:59,159 --> 01:28:01,252
Well, you could
give 'em a phone call.

1113
01:28:01,239 --> 01:28:05,642
<i>No, no, I'm sorry. If I decide
to go back and testify,</i>

1114
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:07,518
I want to see my friends first.

1115
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:12,454
Well, I guess, uh,

1116
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:16,341
- a quick side trip wouldn't do too much harm.
- Not at all.

1117
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:18,807
<i>- And I'll stay with you until you're on the plane.
- Thanks, Gina.</i>

1118
01:28:52,212 --> 01:28:55,841
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
01:28:56,852 --> 01:28:59,582
I'll let the dog out.
Will you grab my bag?

1120
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:03,340
<i>- Got it.
- Whoa.</i>

1121
01:29:03,252 --> 01:29:07,746
<i>Archie! Archie! Archie!</i>

1122
01:29:10,259 --> 01:29:12,887
<i>Archie, stop!</i>

1123
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:17,137
- Archie, come back here right now!
- Archie!

1124
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:19,940
<i>- Archie! Archie!
- Stop it, Archie! Don't...</i>

1125
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:23,792
- Come back here!
- Aw, sic 'em, Archie. Eat the cat.

1126
01:29:24,787 --> 01:29:26,778
<i>So I asked her to marry me.</i>

1127
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:29,830
- Really? What'd she say?
- She hung up on me.

1128
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:33,839
- You asked her on the phone?
- Yeah, I asked her on the phone.

1129
01:29:33,746 --> 01:29:38,308
<i>Remember, I'm stuck on an island?
I'm at a dinner party, I can't get away.</i>

1130
01:29:38,193 --> 01:29:40,889
Dumb, stupid idea.
I know. Sorry.

1131
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:43,341
I'm sorry
I ruined my life.

1132
01:29:43,313 --> 01:29:45,281
I'm sorry the suspect
got shot by my gun.

1133
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:47,392
I'm sorry the Mercedes
went into the bay.

1134
01:29:47,377 --> 01:29:50,244
- What about me gettin' hit?
- Sorry about that too.

1135
01:29:50,193 --> 01:29:53,356
- And me rollin' down the stairs?
- I'm sorry about that too.

1136
01:29:53,296 --> 01:29:56,060
- And my moustache?
- All right!

1137
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:59,543
What are you gonna do,
blame the deficit on me?

1138
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:09,441
Just... really sorry
that she walked out on me.

1139
01:30:14,127 --> 01:30:17,528
Dad... we still have
each other.

1140
01:30:17,455 --> 01:30:20,788
Humph.
A reason to live.

1141
01:30:30,286 --> 01:30:33,687
<i>- Chris?
- Hmm?</i>

1142
01:30:33,614 --> 01:30:36,208
<i>They're back.</i>

1143
01:30:36,174 --> 01:30:40,304
<i>- Who?
- Gina and the woman I love.</i>

1144
01:30:41,326 --> 01:30:44,261
<i>- Cops.
- Who's the other one?</i>

1145
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:46,231
<i>- Lawyer.
- Lawyer.</i>

1146
01:30:46,222 --> 01:30:49,191
- They're going back to Vegas.
- I'm sure gonna miss her.

1147
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:52,625
<i>- Come on, let's get the hell outta here.
- Another car.</i>

1148
01:30:56,429 --> 01:30:58,590
<i>More cops,
it looks like.</i>

1149
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:03,938
- In a Mustang?
- Maybe another lawyer.

1150
01:31:09,484 --> 01:31:12,920
<i>This guy's got a gun.
Not a lawyer.</i>

1151
01:31:18,571 --> 01:31:21,870
<i>She had to constantly
smear cream on herself.</i>

1152
01:31:21,803 --> 01:31:25,000
<i>I spent a week
at the Mirage. I loved it there.</i>

1153
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:27,908
Come on in. Relax a minute.
Take a look at this, will ya?

1154
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:47,895
<i>- Get down!
- Get down!</i>

1155
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:51,612
- Get down, there's a man!
- Behind the tree! He's got a gun! Get down!

1156
01:31:51,529 --> 01:31:54,498
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's them!
- What? What?</i>

1157
01:31:54,441 --> 01:31:57,706
- Get down! Get down!
- There's a man! Get down!

1158
01:31:57,641 --> 01:32:00,166
- Brian, it's them! It's those guys that tried to kill me!
- What?

1159
01:32:00,137 --> 01:32:03,595
Everybody, get down!
No, not there! Get up here!

1160
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:05,793
<i>Do it fast!
Keep your heads down!</i>

1161
01:32:08,616 --> 01:32:11,983
Police! Freeze!

1162
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,249
The idiots are shooting at us.
Stop shooting at us, you idiots.

1163
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,696
They think we're the bad guys.
Show 'em your badge.

1164
01:32:22,599 --> 01:32:25,466
- They're never gonna believe we're cops.
- Gina's there, she'll tell 'em.

1165
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:27,906
Go on!
Hold it up!

1166
01:32:27,879 --> 01:32:30,143
Wait a minute.
Why don't you show 'em yours?

1167
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:32,178
<i>You think I'm crazy?</i>

1168
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:34,101
All right,
all right!

1169
01:32:34,087 --> 01:32:37,215
- Do it together. One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1170
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:41,095
Don't shoot! We're cops!

1171
01:32:40,998 --> 01:32:43,057
<i>Great idea.</i>

1172
01:32:43,046 --> 01:32:45,947
- Can we shoot back?
- What if we kill 'em?

1173
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,385
- What if they kill us?
- Good point.

1174
01:32:48,358 --> 01:32:51,259
Okay. You go,
I'll cover you.

1175
01:32:51,206 --> 01:32:53,140
Go!

1176
01:32:53,126 --> 01:32:56,027
Wait a minute.
Why don't you go, and I cover?

1177
01:32:55,974 --> 01:32:58,101
Because I'm already doing
the covering thing! Go on, go on!

1178
01:32:58,085 --> 01:33:01,145
But you're older.
You got less to live for.

1179
01:33:01,093 --> 01:33:03,653
- Get outta here!
- Don't shoot anybody.

1180
01:33:14,596 --> 01:33:17,156
- Who'd ya see?
- The same men.

1181
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:19,058
- The ones from last night? Oh, my God.
- Yes.

1182
01:33:19,044 --> 01:33:22,013
- Stop shooting, stop shooting! They're police!
- What?

1183
01:33:21,956 --> 01:33:24,049
They're cops.
Det. Lecce and Reimers out of Seattle.

1184
01:33:24,036 --> 01:33:26,903
They're with me.
Part of the stakeout next door.

1185
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:30,844
Bullshit! If they're cops, what the
hell are they shootin' at us for?

1186
01:33:30,755 --> 01:33:33,815
- Because you're shooting at them!
- Call for backup.

1187
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:43,329
Chris, Bill, stop!
I told 'em you're cops!

1188
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:52,784
Oh, shit.

1189
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,967
- Steve. Steve! Hang in there, buddy.
- I'm all right.

1190
01:34:07,073 --> 01:34:10,565
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on, Steve.

1191
01:34:32,672 --> 01:34:36,699
- In the basement!
- No, no! I gotta get her outta the house!

1192
01:34:36,607 --> 01:34:38,541
Go!

1193
01:34:38,527 --> 01:34:41,087
<i>Tommy.</i>

1194
01:34:41,055 --> 01:34:43,023
You?

1195
01:34:43,007 --> 01:34:46,636
Jesus Christ, am I glad to see you.
I've been goin' nuts here.

1196
01:34:46,559 --> 01:34:49,460
- Where is she?
- She's back there. Upstairs.

1197
01:34:49,406 --> 01:34:51,340
It's great
workin' with you, Tom.

1198
01:35:05,373 --> 01:35:08,467
- You bastard.
- I'm a cop.

1199
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:12,681
<i>Run to the water. Stay by the shore.</i>

1200
01:35:12,637 --> 01:35:15,731
Don't stop for anything.

1201
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:18,474
- Go!
- I can't.

1202
01:35:18,429 --> 01:35:20,863
Go!
Jump, goddamn it!

1203
01:35:47,354 --> 01:35:49,652
Ow!

1204
01:35:49,626 --> 01:35:53,187
Throw out your gun!

1205
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:56,743
Come out with your hands
above your head!

1206
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,759
This is the police.
You're completely surrounded!

1207
01:35:58,746 --> 01:36:01,476
- You got ten seconds!
- No, you got ten seconds!

1208
01:36:01,434 --> 01:36:04,232
You kill her, we kill you.
It's that simple.

1209
01:36:04,185 --> 01:36:07,518
- She's a friend of yours. Want to see her die?
- I'm sorry.

1210
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:09,645
I'm sorry!

1211
01:36:09,626 --> 01:36:13,687
You see. She's sorry.
Now back off.

1212
01:36:13,593 --> 01:36:16,289
Back the hell off!
Now!

1213
01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:20,865
Ooo, I don't like
what you're thinkin', ace.

1214
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:24,317
Cool heads, boys.
Cool heads.

1215
01:36:40,663 --> 01:36:42,597
Let's talk,
gentlemen.

1216
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:45,177
<i>- No talk.
- Let's trade here. What do you care?</i>

1217
01:36:45,144 --> 01:36:48,238
<i>You want her alive, right? I don't
care about her, you can have her.</i>

1218
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:50,276
But I get the other one.
I get who I came for.

1219
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:52,458
<i>She walks away and I walk away.
It works for me.</i>

1220
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:56,102
<i>- Shoot her. I don't care. You're not walkin' out of here.
- Nobody's gonna blame you guys.</i>

1221
01:36:56,022 --> 01:36:58,217
But somebody is gonna die,
I promise you that.

1222
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:00,689
- Oh!
- You got a shot?

1223
01:37:00,662 --> 01:37:02,095
- I got a shot.
- You got nothin'!

1224
01:37:02,102 --> 01:37:05,003
- Take it.
- I'm takin' it. I'm gonna drop this bastard!

1225
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:08,181
Listen to me. Shut up!
Let's trade here, all right?

1226
01:37:08,118 --> 01:37:10,678
We're runnin' outta time,
boys. Runnin' outta time.

1227
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:38,485
- He got me. Did you get him?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1228
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:41,355
- Am I gonna live? Excellent.
- Yeah.

1229
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:44,235
- Gina? Oh, my God. Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

1230
01:37:44,179 --> 01:37:46,113
- Are you sure?
- She'll be all right. Yeah.

1231
01:37:46,099 --> 01:37:48,294
- Good dog, Arch. Good dog.
- Oh, good dog.

1232
01:37:56,179 --> 01:37:58,272
- You havin' a good week?
- Perfect.

1233
01:37:58,258 --> 01:38:00,192
- Hey.
- You hurt bad?

1234
01:38:00,178 --> 01:38:03,773
Nah. Winged me, clipped me. Took a
hit in the shoulder. It was nothin'.

1235
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:06,259
- I'm just glad it wasn't me.
- Yeah, glad it wasn't me.

1236
01:38:06,226 --> 01:38:10,162
I cannot believe I'm about to say this,
but I'm actually gonna miss you guys.

1237
01:38:10,066 --> 01:38:12,694
- A little.
- Yeah, well, we're gonna miss you too.

1238
01:38:12,657 --> 01:38:14,591
- A little less.
- Thank you.

1239
01:38:14,577 --> 01:38:16,511
- The bad news is your dog's okay.
- I know you love him.

1240
01:38:16,497 --> 01:38:18,431
- We gotta go.
- I can feel you love him.

1241
01:38:18,417 --> 01:38:21,511
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, listen, if I get another assignment like this,</i>

1242
01:38:21,457 --> 01:38:23,687
- how about I give you guys a call?
- No.

1243
01:38:23,666 --> 01:38:26,464
No? Right.
I am gonna sue for custody.

1244
01:38:26,417 --> 01:38:30,012
<i>- For him? Take him. He irritates the hell out of me.
- Yes.</i>

1245
01:38:29,936 --> 01:38:32,370
Hey, you were right.
I do look better without it.

1246
01:38:33,744 --> 01:38:36,872
That's why I shaved mine off.
Because I look better without it.

1247
01:38:36,816 --> 01:38:39,751
<i>No. You shaved yours off
because you look old with it.</i>

1248
01:38:39,696 --> 01:38:42,529
<i>- How old do I look?
- You look like, uh, Santa Claus old.</i>

1249
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,415
<i>- What? That's ridiculous!
- You look like a little old clockmaker.</i>

1250
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,193
You're even starting to smell old.

1251
01:38:54,063 --> 01:38:56,759
- So you wanna go get somethin' to eat?
- No, go home.

1252
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,155
You got a wife and kids.
They miss you. I don't know why.

1253
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:04,523
Why don't you come over?
You got nothin' to eat here.

1254
01:39:04,494 --> 01:39:07,361
No one to eat with.
You'll get lonely, depressed.

1255
01:39:07,311 --> 01:39:09,245
You'll start wondering
what you got to live for.

1256
01:39:09,231 --> 01:39:11,495
I'll have to go downtown,
identify the body.

1257
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:14,303
Come on, do it for me.

1258
01:39:14,254 --> 01:39:19,351
It's only three stories.
I'd just hurt myself. I'll see ya.

1259
01:39:19,214 --> 01:39:21,944
- Okay, Dad.
- Enough with the dad thing.

1260
01:39:57,355 --> 01:39:59,289
<i>Hola?</i>

1261
01:39:59,275 --> 01:40:02,802
<i>Hello, uh,
puedo hablar con Maria.</i>

1262
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:04,995
<i>- Quien habla?
- It's Chris. Who do you thin...</i>

1263
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:07,302
Hello?

1264
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,957
Would you marry me?

1265
01:40:43,368 --> 01:40:45,302
Yes.

1266
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,900
Awww!

1267
01:45:11,859 --> 01:45:14,657
<i>- Oooh!
-</i>

1268
01:45:14,658 --> 01:45:18,890
<i>Well</i>

1269
01:45:18,891 --> 01:45:20,984
<i>I don't know
what happened</i>

1270
01:45:20,985 --> 01:45:23,681
<i>How I found you, girl</i>

1271
01:45:23,682 --> 01:45:28,449
<i>I guess it was
my turn to fall</i>

1272
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:33,217
<i>Thought I was strong
Had my feet on the ground</i>

1273
01:45:33,218 --> 01:45:37,484
<i>But your kiss, baby
turned my whole life around</i>

1274
01:45:37,485 --> 01:45:38,952
<i>Baby</i>

1275
01:45:38,953 --> 01:45:43,117
<i>So I guess that love
sweet love</i>

1276
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:46,417
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1277
01:45:46,418 --> 01:45:50,582
<i>I know love, sweet love</i>

1278
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:54,519
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1279
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,545
<i>Some people think</i>

1280
01:45:56,546 --> 01:45:59,538
<i>When love
comes their way</i>

1281
01:45:59,539 --> 01:46:03,976
<i>It's always
gonna stay around</i>

1282
01:46:03,977 --> 01:46:06,343
<i>They take it for granted</i>

1283
01:46:06,344 --> 01:46:08,710
<i>Until one day</i>

1284
01:46:08,711 --> 01:46:13,375
<i>That house of love
comes tumblin'down</i>

1285
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:18,473
<i>Oh, just when I thought
my life was through</i>

1286
01:46:18,474 --> 01:46:23,241
<i>Out of nowhere, baby
I found you</i>

1287
01:46:23,242 --> 01:46:28,270
<i>Yeah, to prove that love
Oh yeah, sweet love</i>

1288
01:46:28,271 --> 01:46:33,868
<i>Has a mind of its own
Uh-huh</i>

1289
01:46:33,869 --> 01:46:37,862
<i>I tell you love
sweet love</i>

1290
01:46:37,863 --> 01:46:42,926
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1291
01:46:42,927 --> 01:46:45,020
<i>It can take you to heaven</i>

1292
01:46:45,021 --> 01:46:50,982
<i>Or drive you down
on your knees</i>

1293
01:46:50,983 --> 01:46:55,750
<i>But no matter
what love puts us through</i>

1294
01:46:55,751 --> 01:47:00,188
<i>Girl, you know I wanna
share it all with you</i>

1295
01:47:00,189 --> 01:47:03,989
<i>- I wanna share it all with you, hey
- Hey, hey</i>

1296
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:07,551
<i>There's no way to control it
It's not just our own</i>

1297
01:47:07,552 --> 01:47:13,149
<i>But it's the best thing
this world's ever known</i>

1298
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:18,850
<i>Love, sweet love
Has a mind of its own</i>

1299
01:47:18,851 --> 01:47:22,412
<i>Well
I know, I know for sure</i>

1300
01:47:22,413 --> 01:47:25,382
<i>- Love, sweet love
- Love</i>

1301
01:47:25,383 --> 01:47:29,786
<i>Yes, it has a mind
of its own</i>

1302
01:47:29,787 --> 01:47:31,914
<i>Baby,
you turn my head around</i>

1303
01:47:31,915 --> 01:47:35,578
<i>- Love, sweet love
- Love, sweet love</i>

1304
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:39,538
<i>- Has a mind of its own
- Love's got a mind of its own</i>

1305
01:47:39,539 --> 01:47:41,507
<i>I can't control it, now</i>

1306
01:47:41,508 --> 01:47:44,773
<i>- Love, sweet love
- My love</i>

1307
01:47:44,774 --> 01:47:48,574
<i>Has a mind of its own</i>

1308
01:47:48,575 --> 01:47:51,009
<i>I can't believe
I found you, girl</i>

1309
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,501
<i>Love, sweet love</i>
