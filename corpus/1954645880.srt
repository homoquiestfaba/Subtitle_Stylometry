1
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,453
   Are you ready for a tale?

2
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,923
         A tale as old
    as the hills themselves?

3
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,600
They say the mountain is alive.

4
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,771
        It takes breaths
    from all that is living:

5
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,707
    the trees, the flowers,

6
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,709
           the grass.

7
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,984
        But the mountain
      is also unforgiving,

8
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,554
    and takes what it wants.

9
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,423
     It gives back nothing,

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,459
    not of its own choosing.

11
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:38,764
         It gives back
       only what escapes.

12
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,833
        But why, father?

13
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,568
           Long ago,

14
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,704
        the evil spirit
    fought the good spirit.

15
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,173
      The good spirit lost

16
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,742
         and fled west
       towards the ocean.

17
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,982
    The evil spirit hid here
        in the mountain,

18
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,284
        and never left.

19
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,919
     The white man believes

20
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:05,858
        the evil spirits
   showed themselves in 1846.

21
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,193
    The white man is wrong.

22
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:12,297
        Evil spirit came
   long before they arrived.

23
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,801
   And while the evil spirits
    quieted for many years,

24
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,270
     they did not go away;

25
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,572
          they slept.

26
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,071
We're almost there, girls.

27
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,575
    Ah, still a long winter,
            I know.

28
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,443
          We made it.

29
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,445
       Camp will be glad.

30
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,838
       You two did great.

31
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,373
           Good girl.

32
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,710
   We almost didn't make it.

33
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,579
        Blizzard's bad.

34
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,016
     Rations should last us
          the winter.

35
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,030
             Jacob?

36
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,564
           Elizabeth?

37
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,978
            Harriet?

38
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,385
      What in God's name?

39
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,737
            William!

40
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,706
      What are you doing?

41
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,631
   I have to say, I'm kind of
       digging my badge.

42
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,900
    Makes me feel important.

43
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,572
   Were you excited when you
        got your badge?

44
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,273
            Well...

45
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,908
      ...certainly gets me
        in the building,

46
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,044
     and after seven years
      of higher education,

47
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,047
 I also consider it my "get out
    of student loans card."

48
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,916
       Wow, seven years?

49
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,618
     I only went to school
         for two years,

50
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,888
  yet we have the same badge.

51
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,856
        Staff-Bright did
        give me 90 days

52
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,925
         to try you out
    and see if you're worthy

53
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,461
        of working here
     on a permanent basis.

54
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,230
I wouldn't worry about it, Eve.

55
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,666
         In actuality,
 everything constantly changes

56
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,902
     on a geologic scale...

57
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:07,172
  ...and on my bathroom scale.

58
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,340
 Maybe you should try switching

59
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,175
     to something healthier
         than burgers.

60
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,610
              Hmm.

61
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,045
 Well, that'd certainly be good
      for my cholesterol,

62
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,582
     but, I'm a carnivore,
        not a herbivore.

63
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,452
  Every now and then I need to
 eat something red and bloody.

64
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,188
   Reminds me I'm at the top
       of the food chain.

65
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,524
Yeah, well, I'm a yogurt whore.

66
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,794
  Reminds me that I don't like
        to kill animals.

67
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,497
Then why do we have incisors?

68
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,099
      I'd like to see you
          chase a deer

69
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,434
        and take it down
      with your incisors.

70
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,838
        I don't have to.
         We've evolved.

71
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,073
        I can use tools.

72
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,376
          Well, here.

73
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,579
       Why don't you use
      one of these tools.

74
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,280
      You got a little...

75
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,664
     I thought the volcano
          was dormant.

76
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,733
   It was, and now it's not.

77
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:13,138
       Looks like we have
       the potential for
     an explosive caldera.

78
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,305
           A caldera?

79
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,207
From the Latin word "calderia."

80
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,876
       Means cooking pot.

81
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,912
 Sometimes it's referred to as
  the English word "cauldron."

82
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,647
           Witchin'.

83
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,716
         What's in it?

84
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:27,552
  Ignimbrite, rhyolite, tuff,
    and other igneous rocks.

85
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,120
      That's quite a brew.

86
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,022
        When the gasses
    are under high pressure,

87
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,791
which they tend to--

88
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,927
   Yeah, a massive explosion
           of magma.

89
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,532
<i> ...so please make sure</i>
  <i> you take your pets with you</i>

90
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,068
         <i> as well as any</i>
     <i> necessary medications,</i>

91
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,403
  <i> and shut off any gas lines.</i>

92
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:49,207
      <i> The volcano eruption</i>
      <i> is expected any time</i>
       <i> from next week on.</i>

93
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,510
   <i> Again, this is not a test.</i>

94
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,680
    <i> Please stay tuned in for</i>
  <i> more news on the evacuation.</i>

95
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,983
       <i> We will now return</i>
        <i> to our regularly</i>
     <i> scheduled programming.</i>

96
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,703
           Hi, Mindy.

97
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,872
           You okay?

98
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,775
             Yeah.
         Yeah, just...

99
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,877
  ...going through everything,
            is all.

100
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,748
   Never easy just packing up
      and leaving, I know.

101
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,716
        It's just stuff.

102
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,953
   Well, most of it, anyway.

103
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,555
          That's cute.

104
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,858
      Well, look at this.

105
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,927
   Oh, hey, go Mountaineers!
        - Class of 19--

106
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,563
     Oh, don't say it, now.
   People'll think we're old.

107
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,834
 Hey, let me get that for you.

108
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,671
         Thanks, Mike.

109
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,675
       You, um- you move
      your family out yet?

110
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,145
             Uh...

111
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,746
         Rita moved out
       a few months ago.

112
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,648
           It, uh...

113
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,384
...didn't take a volcano warning
         for her to go.

114
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,320
    I'm sorry to hear that.

115
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,655
        Yeah, well, uh,

116
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,857
    at least she and Dillon
         will be safe.

117
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,492
             Yeah.

118
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,429
   You know, I'm glad to see
  you're heeding the warning.

119
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,532
  I wish I could say the same
            for Ben.

120
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,739
      My dad is how he is.

121
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,943
        Mindy, you know,
when Mount St. Helens went off,

122
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,778
  57 people lost their lives.

123
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,714
   A lot of those were people
     who refused to leave.

124
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,783
    I wish I could help you.

125
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,354
    My dad is more stubborn
      than my daughter is.

126
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,759
 At least she listens to me...

127
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,494
      ...some of the time.

128
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,996
    Well, I can imagine so,
            but I...

129
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,898
...need you to try and at least
   talk some sense into him.

130
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,168
       By staying behind,
     he endangers the lives
    of our first responders.

131
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,636
       Our rescue teams.

132
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:03,141
  You're just asking me to do
 something that can't be done.

133
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,777
 He doesn't change his mind...

134
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,447
        ...on anything.

135
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,984
  I need you to at least try.

136
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,253
      Now, I talked to him
   and he won't listen to me.

137
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,488
 I figured since you're family,
    you have a better shot.

138
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,556
           Some shot.

139
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,328
     He hasn't returned my
phone calls in ten years, Mike.

140
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,064
     Well, maybe it's time
     you paid him a visit.

141
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,108
      Maybe you're right.

142
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,278
         Thanks, Mindy.

143
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,530
  I- I could get that for you.

144
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,368
            Thanks.

145
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,346
 You know, I really appreciate
you checking up on us, and all,

146
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,349
    but don't you have some
     more important things
    you should be handling?

147
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,718
    I think Deputy Tisdale's
     got it under control.

148
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,420
        At least I hope.

149
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,356
    You and your dad are my
    last stops before I head
       down the mountain.

150
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,062
 Everybody wants the old codger
          to be safe.

151
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,530
           I got him.

152
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,968
        What is she... ?

153
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,077
             What?

154
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,114
        Sorry I couldn't
       get here earlier.

155
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,285
 Blue Betty doesn't do so well
    over 60 miles per hour.

156
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,887
    What are you doing here?

157
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:56,921
       I'm here to help.

158
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,656
You're not supposed to be here.

159
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:01,125
        You are driving
      right into disaster.

160
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,027
        It's dangerous.

161
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,300
        Not as dangerous
      as Blue Betty, huh?

162
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,969
        She's harmless.

163
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,104
  Well, maybe if you spent...

164
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,240
 ...your money on state school
     instead of art school,

165
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,076
you'd have two new cars by now.

166
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,012
   True, but now I can draw a
 really pretty picture of her.

167
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,815
       Plus, she's slow,
   so it saves me money on...

168
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,784
      ...speeding tickets.
        Right, sheriff?

169
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,120
   That sounds logical to me.

170
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,955
     Whose side are you on?

171
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,958
  Ryan, come say hi to my mom
      and Sheriff Denton.

172
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,196
     Uh, nice to meet you.

173
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,667
          You must be
    the comic book collector
   I've heard so much about.

174
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,136
     Normally, I don't like
  to reveal my true identity,

175
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,305
     but, yeah, that's me.

176
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,042
             Howdy.

177
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,978
             Howdy.

178
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,681
          As a lawman
      in these parts, son,

179
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,250
   let me give you two pieces
      of friendly advice.

180
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,219
          What's that?

181
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,087
        Don't say howdy.

182
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,856
            And two,

183
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,991
         you watch out
     for these two ladies.

184
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,761
       They are dangerous
       with a capital D.

185
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,433
      Girls, let's get off
         this mountain.

186
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,935
          Devil's Peak
     don't wait for nobody.

187
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,671
     And that includes Ben.
          You hear me?

188
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,075
        You and Grandpa
       are talking again?

189
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,291
<i>Again, the eruption is expected</i>

190
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,693
  <i> any time starting next week.</i>

191
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:46,898
   <i> All residents are urged to</i>
   <i> relocate to Prophetstown.</i>

192
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,967
       <i> Federal Emergency</i>
    <i> Management Agency, FEMA,</i>

193
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,403
        <i> will be handling</i>
        <i> the evacuation.</i>

194
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,707
     <i> For more information,</i>
 <i> please contact local offices.</i>

195
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,990
Lou, come in.

196
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,193
             Yeah?

197
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,161
      Our girl actin' up?

198
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,565
       Yeah, yeah, she is
      a little bit cranky.

199
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,567
    But then, if you ask me,
        not much more so

200
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,169
than a lot of the women in town
      at the garden club.

201
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,437
      Oh, you would know.

202
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,574
  You've been up there starin'
 at her for how many years now?

203
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:30,808
              Ah.

204
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,678
 More than I care to remember.

205
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,613
     Why don't you get down
        from there, Lou?

206
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,014
    Get over to a safe zone.

207
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,382
 Hell, got over to Prophetstown

208
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,252
  and get some of Carol Ann's
       famous apple pie.

209
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,321
    We'll take it from here.

210
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:47,758
   Ah, no, I think I'll just
 sit tight a little bit longer.

211
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,695
        Gotta stick with
       my old girl here,

212
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,830
       Mount St. Barbara.

213
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,602
 Nobody calls it that anymore,
    Lou, it's Devil's Peak.

214
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,638
        I never did like
      that touristy name.

215
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,708
  It's a lot cooler for a guy
to say he climbed Devil's Peak.

216
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,209
        Don't you think?

217
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,978
      Well, if you say so.

218
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,480
She'll always be Barbara to me.

219
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,682
 You know, lately, she's gotten
     to be a lot like you.

220
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,917
      Gettin' real ornery.

221
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,887
      Huffin' and puffin'
    for no apparent reason.

222
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,322
     There, there, Barbara.

223
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,790
    Don't you listen to him.

224
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,759
        He doesn't know
       what he's saying.

225
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,128
      He doesn't know you
        like I know you.

226
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,631
I know that sometimes you just,
              uh--

227
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,634
   Well, you just wanna take
  a little smoke, that's all.

228
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,906
       It ain't the smoke
       I'm worried about.

229
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,549
    What are your readings?

230
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,218
      This can't be right.

231
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,653
             What?

232
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,591
              Ow.

233
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,804
Let me try yours.

234
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,211
Sheriff, he--

235
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,478
            Nothing.

236
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,448
      We've gotta go, Eve.

237
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,317
        We've gotta go.
         - Okay, okay.

238
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,466
<i> Please proceed</i>
        <i> through the town</i>

239
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,735
       <i> by the designated</i>
       <i> evacuation routes.</i>

240
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,971
       <i> You will be given</i>
     <i> further instructions.</i>

241
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,772
       <i> Please proceed...</i>

242
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,277
Tisdale, come in.

243
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,185
       Go ahead, Sheriff.

244
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,255
 I checked in with the Roberts
   and they're clearin' out.

245
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,756
      Lou's keeping an eye
        on the mountain.

246
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,958
          I'll be back
      to the station soon.

247
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,293
          Sounds good.

248
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,528
   You can deal with the FEMA
    folks and the red tape.

249
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,897
     You know, you haven't
      signed my boot yet.

250
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,568
     Never heard of anybody
        signing a boot.

251
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,037
    You get a cast on there,
 and I'll break out my Sharpie.

252
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,773
         I'll write you
      a real love letter.

253
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,341
          Okay, boss.

254
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,180
 You know, maybe you shouldn't
        play rodeo clown
       in your off time.

255
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,882
             Maybe.

256
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,252
        Remember, you're
     in Northern California
         now, pilgrim.

257
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,222
        I need to get me
    one of them map things.

258
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,326
           Copy that.
          Denton out.

259
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,599
         Rodeo clown...

260
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,136
       Girls, you need to
        get out of here.

261
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,043
 Really, after all these years,
  that's all you have to say?

262
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,211
              Yep.

263
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,480
       Haven't you heard?

264
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,082
           Yes, Dad.

265
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,453
 We have at least another week
    before it's gonna blow.

266
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,222
 Well, then, I guess I got time
           for a hug.

267
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,458
       Come here, Nikki!

268
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,226
    Give your gramps a hug!

269
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:50,234
   Oh, you are just as purty
         as ever, doll.

270
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,869
             Whoo!

271
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,805
You just haven't changed a bit.

272
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,874
          Yeah, right.
    I've doubled in height.

273
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,744
    Well, I knew you'd grow.

274
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,346
      Too bad you weren't
        here to see it.

275
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,515
     Good to see you, too.

276
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,019
           You ready?
       We need to leave.

277
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,788
   Why don't you and I go in
       and have some tea

278
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,191
  and leave your mom and, uh,
      your friend out here

279
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,527
       to talk about us?

280
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,699
          You serious?

281
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:25,436
     You said I had a week
 before that damn thing blows.

282
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:29,540
I mean about leaving Ryan and I
           out here.

283
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,342
           Oh, that?

284
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,378
       Yeah, I'm serious.

285
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,528
           You know,

286
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,631
  you and Mom don't have to be
    so nasty to each other.

287
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,568
             No...

288
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,404
     ...I reckon we don't.

289
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,743
            Cheers.

290
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,923
    Mom did what she thought
           was right.

291
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,424
     She- she didn't know.

292
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,159
             Nikki.

293
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,532
   I don't wanna get into it.

294
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,406
    I remember coming here.

295
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,147
  You always had a pack of gum
        in the top shelf
       of that cabinet...

296
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,015
 ...which I could never reach.

297
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,485
 Well, not for lack of trying.

298
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,955
      You used to stack up
    everything in the place

299
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,691
    just to get at that gum.

300
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,360
     You can reach it now.
      Go on, have a piece.

301
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,895
           Just one?

302
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,397
    Nah, it's been too long.

303
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,633
   Have as many as you like.

304
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:08,706
      You used to make me
       sing or do a trick
 before you'd give me a piece.

305
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,140
             Well?

306
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,585
       You still got it.

307
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,161
      Place looks the same
         as I remember.

308
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,498
          Except this.

309
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,502
       You have an iPad?
       - I sure do, doll.

310
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:42,273
    I also tumble on Tumblr,
       Reddit, and tweet.

311
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:43,941
              Wow.

312
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,510
        I guess you can
      teach an old dog...

313
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,013
     All right, that's it.
    I'm gonna get me an app.

314
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:51,549
      I'm gonna teach you
         some manners.

315
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:58,422
     You know, I would love
 to follow "Old Ben's Friends"

316
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,424
       on one condition.

317
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,861
   What's that, Tweety Bird?

318
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,196
     You follow me and Mom
          outta here.

319
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,769
Is that the best offer you got?

320
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,238
    Or we can just sit here
            and talk

321
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,074
     until our fiery death
          by volcano.

322
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,510
  Because I'm not leaving here
          without you.

323
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,630
            Really?

324
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,831
            Really.

325
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,884
      What in the name of
 Stephen Hawking is she doing?

326
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,658
              Hey!

327
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,526
    You've got to evacuate!

328
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,963
The safe zone is ten miles out!

329
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,999
   Then you better get going.

330
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,102
           It's okay.
     I know what I'm doing.

331
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,871
I'm a professional photographer
         and a blogger.

332
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,940
          Yeah, well,
      I'm a volcanologist.

333
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,174
            A what?

334
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,145
 I'm telling you, this volcano
        is gonna erupt.

335
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,347
       He's not kidding.

336
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,816
             Right.
      Listen, don't worry.

337
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,686
     Just a few more shots
      and I'm out of here.

338
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,937
 Welcome to the Darwin Awards.

339
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,839
           And in the
   natural selection category

340
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,142
       the loser is her.

341
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,851
       Can we leave now?

342
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,987
  That's all you're bringing?

343
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,422
             No...

344
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,824
    ...personal belongings,
             no...

345
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,192
       ...family photos?

346
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,861
  It's all stored right here.

347
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:27,331
       What about Mom-- ?
        - In the cloud.

348
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,601
           Forget it.

349
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,069
           Let's go.

350
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,692
            Sheriff?

351
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,428
         Go ahead, Lou.

352
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,598
    Sheriff, I think I spoke
       a little too soon.

353
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,734
   Our old girl here, she's--
            I dunno,

354
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:07,337
     she's developing some
    black lung or something.

355
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:11,275
  She's spitting up more smoke
       than I've seen...

356
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,876
            ...ever.

357
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,512
           All right.
I'll check in with Dr. Stevens.

358
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,781
    Yeah, okay, roger that.

359
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,083
Lou, next time I hear from you,

360
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,518
       you better not be
      in that damn tower,

361
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,754
   or I'm gonna come up there
 and drag you out by your ear.

362
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,622
          You promise?

363
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,624
          I'm serious.
          You read me?

364
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,160
    Yeah, that's a big 10-4.

365
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:47,144
      How did I get stuck
      back here with you?

366
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,313
     Just ignore him, Ryan.

367
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,648
           It's okay.
        He's used to it.

368
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,886
       Ignoring people's
      what the does best.

369
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,058
   Still a wonderful driver,
             I see.

370
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,693
       Sorry about that.

371
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,595
  I saw something in the road.

372
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:06,730
     Yeah, or in your head.

373
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,899
   I think I saw a squirrel.

374
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,802
<i> ...coming shortly from</i>
     <i> FEMA representatives.</i>

375
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,337
       <i> Please stay tuned.</i>

376
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,910
          Easy, easy.
            Sheriff?

377
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:23,046
        Sheriff, this is
      Ranger Danger here.

378
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,715
  I'm getting ready to leave.

379
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,251
       Our girl is shake,
      rattle, and rollin'.

380
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,285
              Out.

381
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,932
          What the-- ?

382
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,839
     Sheriff, yeah, we got-
    We- we have this naked--

383
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,209
            Hold on!

384
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,979
      Well, look at that.

385
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,250
              Lou!

<i> We are under</i>
     <i> mandatory evacuation.</i>

387
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,061
      <i> Repeat, we are under</i>
     <i> mandatory evacuation.</i>

389

390
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,394
              Hey!

391
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,262
              Lou?

392
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,132
              Lou!

393
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,048
         Mom, reverse!
            Reverse!

394
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,885
             Shit!

395
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,528
          Go, go, go.

396
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,698
Everybody out!

397
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,666
    We'll hoof it from here!

398
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,970
    I know a safe way down.

399
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,514
           Oh, my-- !

400
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,756
            Oh, my--
          Oh, my God.

401
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,809
   Can you hold on a second?

402
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,778
 Just please hold on a second.

403
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,947
       Sheriff, go ahead.

404
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,350
 Ranger McGee was in the tower
         when it blew.

405
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:01,751
       He didn't make it.

406
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,854
          Jesus, Lou?

407
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,058
  What's goin' on down there?

408
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,859
        It's a madhouse.

409
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,195
     You seen Mindy Roberts
         or her family?

410
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,430
         Nope, not yet.

411
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,732
     What about Dr. Stevens
       and his assistant?

412
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:19,536
            Nothing.
 Are you on your way back yet?

413
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,271
           Negative.
        Not until I know
        everyone's safe.

414
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,839
     They may be somewhere
      around here already.

415
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,641
   There's no sense in going
     on a wild goose chase.

416
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,877
You just continue with the evac
    and mind the old folks.

417
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,746
       Make sure they get
         on the buses.

418
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,982
           Yes, sir.
           I'm on it.

419
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,883
  You just get back here soon.

420
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,819
          Denton out.

421
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,289
             Shit.

422
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,118
<i> FEMA is ordering all residents</i>
          <i> out of town</i>

Mother fracture!

00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,284
   We gotta get out of here.
            - What?!

431
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,954
  We gotta get out of the car
              now!

432
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,365
       You sure you know
      where you're going?

433
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,435
      I know this mountain
   better than I know myself.

434
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,440
    At least there's no sign
            of lava.

435
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:15,779
      I can say one thing.
      You were always good
         at keeping up.

436
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,213
            Careful.

437
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,048
     I might interpret that
        as a compliment.

438
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,985
 I might have meant it as one.

439
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:24,020
        I said I might.

440
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,455
             Yeah.

441
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,727
       Tisdale, come in.

442
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,629
       Sheriff, go ahead.

443
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:34,631
     You get any word from
      the Roberts family,

444
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,733
        or Dr. Stevens?

445
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,468
          Nothin' yet.

446
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,271
     How's everything going
          down there?

447
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,139
        People are just
      crowding into town,

448
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,408
 hoping this thing ends so they
 can get back to their houses.

449
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,844
     Let's hope they still
          have houses.

450
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,657
          Sheriff out.

451
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,428
You in the road, stop.

452
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,053
             Hello?

453
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,389
   You people can't be here!

454

             Hello!

456
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,989
       Tisdale, come in.

457
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,792
        Tisdale, you got
       any other reports

458
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,996
    of any hikers or campers
   up here on this mountain?

459
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,735
  There's nothing in the logs.
           What's up?

460
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,240
        I dunno, I guess
     I'm just seein' stuff.

461
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,912
     The director of FEMA's
         riding my ass.

462
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,248
        I'm not getting
       off this mountain
 'til I'm sure everyone's safe.

463
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,983
 You handle things down there.

464
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,510
   Are you getting anything?

465
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,614
The blast must have knocked out
        the cell towers.

466
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,282
   We've gotta warn the town.

467
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:08,251
   I think they already know.

468
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,887
       No, that was just
       the initial blast.

469
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,622
   There'll be more tremors,

470
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,624
         and according
     to the readings today,

471
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,693
       the next eruption
     will be much stronger.

472
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,228
     Stronger than anything
        I've ever seen.

473
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,632
    It's a Palean eruption.
       A Palean eruption!

474
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:23,566
             What?

475
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,501
       A super eruption!

476
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,703
    The gasses are trapped,

477
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:29,238
  building up an extraordinary
      amount of pressure.

478
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,308
         The next blast
     will be catastrophic.

479
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,244
    I think they're- I think
  they're evacuating already.

480
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,313
   Not where they need to be.

481
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,983
    They're going only about
         ten miles out.

482
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:43,620
  The safe zone for this blast
      will be at least 20.

483
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,755
      - Come on, come on.
            - Okay.

484
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,857
     - Come on. Come here.
            - Okay.

485
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,490
    I'm sorry I brought you
           out here.

486
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,092
   I never imagined anything
 like this was going to happen.

487
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,728
           It's okay.
   It's good you brought me,
            though.

488
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,196
             Yeah?
          Why's that?

489
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:29,198
   'Cause I have superpowers.

490
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,867
           Oh really?
            - Yeah.

491
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,201
    What kind of superpowers
          do you have?

492
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,803
         It's a secret.

493
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:36,439
    Can I at least watch you
change outfits in a phone booth
           some time?

494
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:39,275
             Sure.
    I can make that happen.

495
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,611
  Okay, well, what about now?

496
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:44,747
   Like, can you burn my name
  into a rock with your eyes?

497
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:53,156
    That's your superpower?
       A bad somersault?

498
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:56,292
       No, my superpower
      is making you laugh.

499
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,763
       Come on, you two.
            Keep up.

500
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,512
      Where are you going?

501
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,096
            Problem?

502
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,498
    I swear I saw something.

503
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,618
       You two go ahead!
         Dad, come on!

504
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,561
  Go on, I'm slowing you down!
          - Dad, move.

505
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,730
      I'm not leaving you.

506
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,699
        Climb that tree!

507
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,672
              Dad!

508
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,183
      All right, come on.

509
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:29,452
   We gotta get to the cabin.

510
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,996
        Where are they?
 - Maybe they went another way.

511
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:42,064
       - I'm going back.
          - Whoa, no!

512
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,335
          To do what?

513
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,237
        Look for a gun!

514
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,148
            Got it.

515
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,349
      Are you kidding me?

516
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,018
             Wha--

517
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,526
              Yes?
      Keep the door shut.

518
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,829
  Wait, no, you keep it shut.
           I'm going.

519
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,198
No, if your mom comes back here
      and you're not here,
         she'll freak!

520
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,867
       Then she'll freak.
     - No! It is not safe.

521
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:20,369
I know, and my mom's out there!

522
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,014
         What the hell
       were those things?

523
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,182
        God only knows.

524
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,884
     You ever seen anything
       like that before?

525
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:37,653
        In all my years
      up on the mountain,

526
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,423
   I've never been acquainted
        with anything...

527
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:43,793
     ...remotely resembling
         those things.

528
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,863
        Makes me wonder.

529
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:48,764
            Wonder?
       What do you mean?

530
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,435
       Well that volcano,
        it swallowed...

531
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:55,605
       ...a lot of people
      back in the 1800's.

532
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,041
          Some say...
        - Some say what?

533
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,645
          Never mind.
    Let's just get to the...

534
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,513
       ...get to the kids
     and get to the cabin.

535
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:06,148
     Tell me they made it,
          right, Dad?

536
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,583
         They made it.
         They're fine.

537
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,852
  It's not even that far off.

538
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:13,256
           Trust me.
They're there, and they're fine.

539
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,058
            For now.
     We gotta get the hell
          outta here.

540
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,028
         Lava's comin'
    down the mountain fast.

541
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,031
          Just relax.
      - I'll relax when we
         find the kids.

542
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:28,170
           It burns!
         God, it burns!

543
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,608
          Oh, my God!

544
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,950
          Oh, my God.

545
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,052
              Dad!

546
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,124
          Oh, my God!

547
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,773
         Mom! Grandpa!
           This way!

548
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,644
      So what happens when
   the second eruption hits?

549
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,213
    From my calculations...

550
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,848
           God, what?

551
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,084
 Only a miracle could save us?

552
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:51,320
  I don't know about miracles
           or God...

553
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,956
    But hey, hey, hey, hey.

554
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,892
      If it's your thing,
        it's your thing.

555
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:59,328
          So, uh, um,

556
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,998
      do you like working
       at the institute?

557
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,601
       You know, I think-
    I think I could get you
      hired on full time.

558
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:10,639
   You know, benefits, 401k,
 free cake on your birthday...

559
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:15,077
           Free cake?
          - Free cake.

560
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,912
           I'm sold.

561
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,384
        What are those?

562
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:23,753
           Hey! Hey!

563
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,493
    Let's pick up the pace.

564
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,161
           That way.

565
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,479
     Go away from me! Run!

566
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,580
              No!

567
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,449
              Run!

568
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,051
              No!

569
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,315
       - Those things...
           - Things?!

570
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:28,250
         Hello! People!

571
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,419
 What we have here are zombies!

572
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,755
     Walking freakin' dead!

573
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,223
        So here's a tip:

574
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:36,692
         Don't get bit,
    or you become a zombie.

575
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,462
     - But they were oozing
          orange goo.
            - Yeah.

576
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:41,630
          I've been to
      horror conventions.

577
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:45,835
 I've seen a pig get mutilated
      by Scottie McDaniels
        in freshman Bio.

578
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:49,004
      I've seen a Klingon
 and a Stormtrooper get married

579
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,673
         to each other!

580
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:51,907
          But that...

581
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,943
 That was some creepy ass shit!

582
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:55,111
        Okay, I think...

583
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,780
     I think we should just
stay here for a bit and just...

584
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,649
      wait until those...
     things clear the area.

585
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,119
        Clear the area?!
        They're zombies!

586
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,087
       They could just...
            wander!

587
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:07,423
 Well, what about the volcano?

588
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:08,524
              I--

589
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,862
      Okay, the ash cloud
      is moving that way,

590
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:14,096
     towards the other side
        of the mountain.

591
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:15,631
    What if the wind decides
      to change direction?

592
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,967
  Then we suffocate in a giant
     black cloud of death.

593
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,070
 Okay, can we just try and keep
   it positive for a minute?

594
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,271
           Positive?

595
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:25,040
     What's positive about
        being chewed on
        by lava zombies?

596
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,510
   Dad, whose cabin is this?

597
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:31,046
 This is Arnie Tramer's place.
    Skittish as a squirrel.

598
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:34,283
 He took off from the mountain
      as soon as he heard
          the warning.

599
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,418
   What-- What are you doing?

600
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,454
 Trying to tap into his wi-fi.

601
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:41,757
    And this way, I can send
      a sheriff a message
        where we're at.

602
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,265
        You, young lady.

603
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:51,033
  You shouldn't even be here.

604
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,869
    You should be at school,
         but not here!

605
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,971
And leave grandpa alone to die?

606
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,040
   He would've stayed behind
     if it weren't for me.

607
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,508
      Lord knows you can't
         convince him.

608
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,710
   Not with your sassy atti--
           - Don't...

609
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,079
         Don't sass me!
            - Fine!

610
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:06,982
           All right.

611
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,551
        Should've known.

612
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,119
     The connection's out.

613
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:12,087
     Your wi-fi's not gonna
        receive a feed.

614
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:13,989
       Where does it go?

615
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,327
         It's outside.

616
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,738
       The blast must've
       knocked this out.

617
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,777
Can we fix it?

618
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,247
              Yes.

619
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,003
          What the...?

620
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,109
       - No, no, no, no!
     - The hell's going on?

621
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,877
       - Get in the car!
          - Hey! Hey!

622
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,948
           Watch out!

623
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,817
        Get in the car!

624
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,255
          Come on! Go!

625
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,223
            Go! Go!

626
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:38,274
- What the hell was that?!
    - I don't know!

627
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,111
      Where's Dr. Stevens?

628
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,713
         They ate him.

629
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,615
             What?

630
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,494
              Hey.

631
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:03,299
       Now we're just...
            waiting.

632
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,937
       You could get off
        that thing now.

633
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,910
           Aw, shush.

634
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,646
      Or maybe you can't.

635
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,116
      Maybe you can't stop
        surfing the web.

636
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,452
          Maybe you're
      an internet addict.

637
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:30,092
   Well, why don't you stage
        an intervention?

638
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,530
          Don't start.

639
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,166
    No, that's a great idea.

640
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:40,669
You know, you can gather up all
 the family and all my friends,

641
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,406
     tell them that I have
     an internet addiction.

642
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,879
   While some soulless things
  are trying to eat us alive.

643
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,918
           And then,
    after everyone leaves...

644
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:01,557
...and I'm totally embarrassed,

645
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,592
          I move away.

646
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,930
  Forever, disowning everyone.

647
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:10,099
          Dying alone.

648
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,437
      That worked so well
         with Meredith.

649
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:18,807
           Why, hell,
    let's just try it again.

650
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,843
      I'll drink to that.

651
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,812
        She was my mom.

652
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,217
     I was trying to help.

653
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,586
       - Yeah, some help.
             - Hey!

654
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:33,922
Grandma had a drinking problem,
  and mom was trying to help.

655
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,157
             Fine!

656
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,192
  And I'm trying to help now.

657
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,531
 I'm gonna tweet my followers,
  send a word where we're at.

658
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,434
            Really?

659
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:47,770
       How many followers
          do you have?

660
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,539
              Two.

661
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,310
           Here, um,
   let me help you with that.

662
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,666
 I've never much liked croquet.

663
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,670
  Why don't you make something
           with this?

664
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,372
      I suck at whittling.

665
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:25,507
      Have Grandpa do it.

666
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,977
       You're the artist.

667
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:31,547
       Nothing I've done
       is worth anything.

668
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,750
      That's so not true.

669
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,820
  Everything you've made is...

670
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:40,155
         is worth more
     than you'll ever know.

671
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,258
           Come here.

672
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,940
            Tisdale.

673
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,708
      You should see this.

674
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,816
- Sheriff, about the volcano...
-  - <i> Sheriff, come in.</i>

675
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,485
     - ...Dr. Stevens was--
           - Hold on.

676
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,588
       Tisdale, go ahead.

677
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,891
    Sheriff, we got a Tweet
      from a Ryan Jacobs.

678
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:19,127
    Says he and the Roberts
         are held up in
     Arnie Tramer's cabin.

679
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,396
         What the hell
    are they doing up there?

680
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:24,867
     Says they're trapped.
 Says they saw some kind of...

681
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,038
       Volcano monsters.
         Yeah, I know.

682
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,407
    Well, they said zombie,
           but okay.

683
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:33,509
        How do you know?

684
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:35,277
      Well, I think I saw
          one of them.

685
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,083
   Listen, you stay put, I'll
 round everybody up down here.

686
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,384
         Wait, Sheriff.

687
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:44,353
       I could join you.
 I could lasso up a few folks,

688
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,821
     cut the time in half.

689
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:51,460
    I-- You're my point man.
   I need you to put on your
 pointy hat and start pointing.

690
00:58:51,462 --> 00:58:53,328
           - Sheriff.
     - Sheriff, but I could
           help you.

691
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,164
    Tisdale, absolutely not.
 That's an order, you stay put.

692
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,533
           - Sheriff!
         - What, what?

693
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,535
        Dr. Stevens said
  that wasn't the main blast.

694
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:01,537
  The volcano's a lot stronger
  than he originally thought.

695
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,105
   The safe zone has to be...

696
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:04,840
at least another ten miles out.

697
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,909
   - Ten miles, you're sure?
          - Ten miles.

698
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:07,976
       Tisdale, come in.

699
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,449
  Sheriff, you're breaking up.
            Repeat.

700
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,020
     Tisdale, get everyone
       out of town, now!

701
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:20,489
 Evacuate them to Prophetstown.

702
00:59:20,491 --> 00:59:21,590
          Do you copy?

703
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:23,091
   Sheriff, I can't hear you.

704
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,526
            Damn it.

705
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:28,931
      That when it blows,
 the top half of the mountain's
        gonna come off.

706
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,599
        It already blew,
     and we're still here.

707
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:35,604
  That wasn't the main blast,
       at least from what
         he was saying.

708
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,005
     Eve, I hate to put you
           in danger,

709
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:41,610
      but I'm not leaving
     this mountain without
      the Roberts family.

710
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,285
     Hey, I'm gonna head up
       to Tramer's cabin,

711
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:55,324
   - I'm right with ya, Hoss.
   - No, just keep everything
       going as planned.

712
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:57,025
  He ordered you to stay put.

713
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,461
         That's crazy,
   especially with your leg.

714
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,297
       Hey, I could still
  kick your ass with one leg.

715
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,732
         If you say so.

716
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:05,667
           I say so.

717
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,288
         Ah! Good news!
     Sheriff's on his way.

718
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,756
         Oh, thank God.

719
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,965
     Well, let's just hope
         that the curse

720
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,868
         of Donner Pass
        just isn't true.

721
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,538
       Curse? What curse?

722
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,243
      Dad, that's enough.

723
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:50,045
      N-No, I wanna know.

724
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,081
       Cherokees say that
    this mountain is cursed.

725
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,283
 Since way back before even the

726
01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:58,854
   people died at Donner Pass
        back in the, uh,

727
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:01,923
        winter of 1846.

728
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:05,360
     Oh, the Donner Party.
       I know this story.

729
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,597
        How'd they die?

730
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,300
   Well, some by starvation,
         some by cold.

731
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:19,041
         Only 45 of the
     81 pioneers survived.

732
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,643
        That's horrible.

733
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,982
       Many of them, uh,

734
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:30,118
    resorted to cannibalism,

735
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,387
    in order not to starve.

736
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:35,223
        They ate the old
      and ate the infants.

737
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,096
      And over the years,
   it's affected all the rest

738
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:43,832
        of the settlers
       that's come here,

739
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:47,636
        either the curse
        or the mountain.

740
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,044
    The mountain spit forth

741
01:01:56,046 --> 01:02:00,215
disease, despair, and insanity.

742
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:03,185
     And anything that was
        good and noble,

743
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:08,824
      the mountain twisted
      to its own evil way.

744
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,692
       It made life hard,

745
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:13,762
   not only for those people
      who tried to cross,

746
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:16,164
but for the trees, the animals.

747
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:20,235
     It let what it wished
       grow in its soil,

748
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,370
        to cover itself
         like a blanket

749
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:26,108
    against those who would
     discover its secrets.

750
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,210
          Pools boiled

751
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,947
    with the souls of those
        trapped within.

752
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,860
   And the mountain destroyed
        what it wished,

753
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:47,462
         with no mercy.

754
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,998
      They say even birds
         who flew over

755
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,869
would sometimes drop in flight.

756
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,604
    Their hearts stopped...

757
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,311
          ...in fear.

758
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,514
     Like the great shaman,

759
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:10,018
   the evil spirit could take
      possession of souls.

760
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,321
        Bring back life
     like a budding flower

761
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,624
    for those who perished.

762
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:19,161
    Loved ones who had lost
         would return,

763
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,662
        only different.

764
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:25,267
     What they brought back
        was no way good.

765
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:28,470
Some said the souls of the dead
          glowed red,

766
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:31,840
     like lava in the heart
        of the mountain,

767
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,311
       waiting to return
         to the living.

768
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:39,948
  That they only needed a push
       from the mountain.

769
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:45,053
     And whenever they got
          the calling,

770
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,957
      death would follow.

771
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,659
           It is said

772
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:52,828
     that every generation

773
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,664
        has a caretaker
        of the mountain,

774
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,333
   someone who looks over it,

775
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,836
          its watcher.

776
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:04,272
    Why doesn't the watcher
      chase the evil away?

777
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:08,276
 Only someone of great strength
   can defeat the evil forces

778
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:10,145
     and free the watcher,

779
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:14,115
so the good spirits can return.

780
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,218
      Who is the watcher?

781
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,099
             Mike.

782
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:32,500
      Everyone all right?

783
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:35,403
      Yes, but there's...
       things out there.

784
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,205
            I know,
        I saw them all.

785
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:40,609
    That lava's moving fast.
We gotta get to the fire tower.

786
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:43,411
         - Fire tower?
       - I've gotta warn
      the people in town,

787
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:45,780
I'll get better
        reception there.

788
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,262
  Step away from the vehicle.

789
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,199
        Stay behind me.

790
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,676
      You'll have to shoot
        for their heads.

791
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,729
  You've gotta be kidding me.

792
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,804
     Get back in the cabin.
  Everybody back in the cabin.

793
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,914
        Get back inside!

794
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,927
      Get-Get some towels!
      Get a first aid kit!

795
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:08,730
        I need a radio!

796
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:11,032
       Ryan, get online!
         Get some help.

797
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,968
      - Wait, wait, wait.
            - What?

798
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,036
    I have to warn the town,
 but I can't send people here.

799
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:17,605
   My daughter is here, Mike.
       Send people here!

800
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:18,974
            I can't!

801
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,742
       Why the hell not?

802
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,012
          The volcano.

803
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:26,715
  It's gone off twice already,
       but it's not done?

804
01:06:26,717 --> 01:06:28,283
    No, those were nothing.

805
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,518
Eve works with Dr. Stevens, she
knows what she's talking about.

806
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,787
   Nothing? That seemed like
        something to me!

807
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:33,855
          Oh, my God!

808
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,258
    My God, it's spreading.

809
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,460
             Mike!

810
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,396
   I'm gonna draw them away.
           When I do,

811
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:43,098
 all of you just run like hell
          to your car.

812
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,400
       That's your plan?
     That's-That's suicide!

813
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:48,436
        Mike, tell him!
     - No, no, he's right.

814
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,805
      You take my cruiser
 and get the kids back to town.
       I-I'll cover you.

815
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:56,011
        Keep them safe,
   in case you run into more
of those damn things out there.

816
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:59,848
   Besides, if my baby here's
 driving, none of us are safe.

817
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,782
             Dad...

818
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,325
         - Stay still.
            - Don't!

819
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,561
      Tisdale, behind you!

820
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:20,535
           - Come on.
    - Let's go. Go, go, go!

821
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,973
            Nicole!

822
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,081
              Run!

823
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,631
        Get in the car!

824
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,838
            Get in!

825
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,776
        Get in the car!

826
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:17,625
    Will you see if there's
        a first aid kit?

827
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,178
   Let's look at that wound.

828
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:42,484
    Mom, it's getting worse.

829
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,902
    I don't know what to do!

830
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,346
          Ryan! Ryan!

831
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:13,448
           Let's go!
          Go, go, go!

832
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,559
Stop! Stop!

833
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,532
- Is everyone all right?
-  - Yeah, yeah.

834
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,734
   Get in the fire tower now.
          Go, go, go!

835
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:33,868
            Come on!

836
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,575
       Come on, come on.

837
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,477
         Come on, Ben.

838
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:43,978
         Almost there.

839
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:51,853
  All right, stay right here.
 I'm gonna go up and check the
tower for the radio, all right?

840
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,121
       Stay right there!

841
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,272
        Shuler, come in!
        This is Denton.
          Do you copy?

842
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,107
Shuler, come in!
        This is Denton!

843
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,609
          Do you copy?

844
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:15,944
       Go ahead, Sheriff.

845
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,880
       Gotta move people
      20 miles out, okay?

846
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,516
The blast zone is now 20 miles.
          Do you copy?

847
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,384
           20 miles?

848
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:26,521
         Yes, 20 miles!
 Get those people moving, now!

849
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:28,957
       Shuler, you copy?

850
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,664
             Allen!

851
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,080
   All right, everybody, run!

852
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:53,748
      Get up in the tower
    with the sheriff. Go on!

853
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,717
          - No, Dad...
- I'll keep 'em away down here.

854
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:57,318
         Go on! Hurry!

855
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,453
            Come on.

856
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,631
  Everyone, top of the tower!
  Go, go, get up there! Move!

857
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,468
        Oh, my God, Dad!

858
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,540
         Get up there.

859
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:28,216
      Hit them with that!
  Mindy, where are you going?!

860
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,321
Dad!

861
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,390
              No!

862
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:37,292
   There's nothing we can do.

863
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,606
              No!

864
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:53,007
            Nicole!

865
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,239
      Hurry, hurry, hurry!

866
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,407
             Hurry!

867
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,083
        Wh-Where's Ryan?
         Where's Ryan?

868
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,954
         Where's Ryan?!

869
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:41,856
             - No.
             - No!

870
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,225
     You need to get down.
     Get down on the floor!

871
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:46,994
         Everyone down!
        It's gonna blow!

872
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,635
Sheriff, come in.

873
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:36,771
        Sheriff Denton,
          do you read?

874
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,514
 Is Burger Barn still standing?

875
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,184
       Sure is, Sheriff.

876
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,386
     Well, that's too bad.

877
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:53,821
      I hate Burger Barn.

878
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,957
We're glad
     you're still standing.

879
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:58,359
 Other than a few downed trees
 and a couple of wrecked cars,

880
01:14:58,361 --> 01:15:00,294
  I'd say we dodged a bullet.

881
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,132
           Copy that.

882
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:18,105
       Boy, that was one
        hell of a ride!

883
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,276
              Dad!

884
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,350
              Hi!

885
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:32,153
         Are you okay?

886
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,291
   What the hell-- How the--

887
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:38,759
        How did you...?

888
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,494
         This mountain,
         she's like me.

889
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:42,663
 She's got a few cracks in it,

890
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:44,899
       and I stuck it out
       in a narrow cave.

891
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:48,202
  Oh, Ben, you wily ol' coot,
     you know you're gonna
     outlive us all, right?

892
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:50,237
Ah, well...

893
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:54,108
    I reckon that if I ever
    have to get stuck again,

894
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,944
        I'd like to have
      some family with me.

895
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,479
          What the...?

896
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,851
  Look at that, you got the--
     hair is just the same.

897
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,256
       I had you with me
        the whole time.

898
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,065
           Let's go.

899
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:25,473
     Wait, hold it, I'm not
  totally damaged goods here.

900
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,441
   Yeah, well, you've looked
    a hell of a lot better.

901
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:29,810
   Yeah? Well, who asked ya?

902
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,758
      And that is the tale
        of the mountain.

903
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,407
       Sometimes I worry
        that Night Wolf

904
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:01,142
       takes a little bit
       too much pleasure

905
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:03,044
   from scaring the children.

906
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,148
            I never.

907
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:10,217
       It's they who like
         being scared.

908
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,385
            Besides,

909
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:13,854
       it's the only way
         I can get them

910
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,557
to listen to tales of the past.

911
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,559
Some history lesson,

912
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,561
         teaching them
         about a curse.

913
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:26,133
 Well, I suppose better a curse
       than curse words.

914
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:29,704
    There are no curse words
   in the Cherokee language.

915
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,872
        I know, but you,

916
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,275
    you've gone and adopted
    the dirty English ones.

917
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:35,876
           Shit, me?

918
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,847
            Come on.
