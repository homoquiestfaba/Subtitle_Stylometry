1
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
- Recognize this face?

2
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
- What did you say this guys name was?

3
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
- I didn't

4
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,560
His name is Andrew Kunain, he's 27 years old,
family lives near here.

5
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,360
- No, Judge de Silva, Andrew de Silva,

6
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:41,761
his father used to come in here all the time,
buy cigars... Kohibas

7
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
- Kohibas, the man's got taste.

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,960
- Well, he was supposed to be some tycoon
in the Philippines or something

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
- And he's rich too.

10
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,201
- Yea, but I heard he had to leave the country,

11
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
cause he was involved in some
embezzlement of some stocks.

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,480
- I find out his last place of residence was
some dump in San Diego.

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
We found a lot of S&M toys.

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,680
- Ahh, that was Andy.

15
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
He loved toys.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,600
- A lot of the people I talked to
knew him pretty well.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Seems like he could never tell the truth about himself
for more than 5 minutes at a stretch.

18
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
- Well, he did make up some fantastic stories.

19
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:17,000
Most of them were so pretentious,
so phony they were laughable.

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
I don't know who believed him.

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,640
He once told me that he was married to a Jewish woman,

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
and his father in law was head of Israeli Masondin.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,960
Still I found him so adorable.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
- You liked him a lot.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
- Well, he was young, attractive, entertaining,

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
what's not to like.

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Cute and a little mean,
an irresistible combination.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Any way, I just fell in
love with him.

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,320
- Seems like a lot of your people did.

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
- My people!

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
- People like you... I mean

32
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,560
- Ohh, I have nothing more to say, officer.
- Uh, I'm not...

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
- Good bye Offcer!
- ... listen, you know...

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,720
Touchy.

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,960
- Would you please tell us anything
you know about him.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
- From what I heard, as child he was never
deprived of anything.

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,720
He was the only one that the family sent
to private school.

38
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,320
Ohh, he was so flamboyant.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You should have seen the first time
that I met him.

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,440
He was beautiful, not just physically.

41
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:20,920
I mean, he was incredible charming, even when you
knew that he was bullshitting you,

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,080
it was still hard to turn yourself off of him.

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,400
You saw him in his tailored blazers,
smoking his fat Kohiba cigars.

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
He made it hard to say no.

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,840
- Forgive me for being blunt, but are you saying
you had an affair with him?

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
- You're asking me if slept with him?

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,600
- Uh huh.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
- I wish!

49
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
- Nooo.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,960
Guess who, ducky.

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Up for a little business tonight?

52
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
What kind?

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,440
Yea, I thought so...
well, I'll see you at the restaurant.

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Ciao.

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Shit!

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,760
- Good evening sir, how are you doing tonight?
- Very well.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
- I'm sorry sir, I didn't see you there.
- That's alright, you're forgiven.

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
- Thank you!

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,080
Cheers!

60
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,440
- Hey, garcon, put this all on
my house account.

61
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:30,441
- Ok, Mr. Kunanin

62
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
- Presents for later

63
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,000
Ladies and Gentleman, as well as you
not so deliciously gentle,

64
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,240
if I might interrupt the festivities for a moment,

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,320
we are gathered here to bid a heartbroken farewell
to one of the most beloved and respected confrers,

66
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,240
an individual of great wit,
a blessing to any gathering.

67
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,241
- Where are you off to, Andy?

68
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:54,120
- San Francisco. I've been invited to
the Versace show.

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
- Who invited you?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
- Gianni!
- Gianni Versace?

71
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,440
- The man himself.
Vodka cranberry, double!

72
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
- Where are you really off too, Andy?

73
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
- I think I found him.
- Found who?

74
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,520
- Double vodka and cranberry sir.

75
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,720
- Thanks. Put the tip on my tab
give yourself a fifty.

76
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,121
- Fifty dollars sir?

77
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,322
- You heard me!

78
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
- Jesus Andy, don't you think
you should take it a little easy?

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,920
- Thank you Mr. Kunanin.
- Call me Andy, love.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,800
- Think you should take it a little
easy with these too.

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,960
- Look, I'm flying back to Minnesota,
take care of some business,

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
bring me back into my millions.

83
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,400
- When did you ever touch a million?

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,640
Minnesota... more valuable antiques?

85
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,320
- Of course!
- The only antiquities you're going to find, my dear Andy,

86
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
are old gents, filled with even older money.

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
- Ahh, do I detect a note of jealousy, love?

88
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,720
- I don't even know you anymore.

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,760
- People don't know me,
they think they do, but they don't.

90
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,120
- Excuse me sir, you have an invitation?
- No, but I know Gianni.

91
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,600
- What's your name?
- Andrew.

92
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,040
- I'm sorry sir, but you're not on the list.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
- Gianni!

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't you remember me?

95
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
- Elago de Como?

96
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
- You remembered. Can I come in?

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
- Sorry sir.
- Gianni!

98
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,480
- No, no...

99
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
...NO! Versace!

100
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,800
- Hi everyone...
Mr. Versace has chosen the models for our Milano show.

101
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,560
Congratulations to those that were chosen,
everybody else better luck next time.

102
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
- Says names...

103
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,240
- Ok everybody, follow me now and
I'll give you the information

104
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,120
you'll need for your agencies, this way.
Thank you!

105
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,400
- Excuse me, Ms. Versace!
You didn't call my name!

106
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
- What is your name, young man?

107
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
- Andrew.
Andrew Kunanin!

108
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,280
- I'm sorry but your not on the list.

109
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,600
- He promised!

110
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,000
- Gianni! Could we talk about it.

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
- No, Buena Sera.

112
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,320
- The boy looks good. You don't like him?

113
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
- Not bad. K
- Why not then?

114
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
- Something in his eyes worries me.

115
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,000
- What?
- este prea disperat!

116
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,000
- Gianni!
- Areverdeci!

117
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,480
- Donatella, Donatella... he promised!

118
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,280
He promised, he promised... Fuck!

119
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
- That guy was stupid, the way he pushed himself at you.

120
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,280
- Well, Antonio, not every man is born with the genius
of Michelangelo or the brain of Galileo.

121
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,400
Some of them are rejects, desperate people.

122
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,360
Their behavior is motivated by their
own biological juices,

123
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,680
so they maybe they become not
only devils but victims too.

124
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,120
- Yes, they too could have become angels,
if not for some superior plan.

125
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,320
- We're all in the hands of God.

126
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,360
- There's our car.

127
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
So how was Italy.

128
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,080
- I barely had time to say Hello and then back to Milan.

129
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,880
How are things here?

130
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,800
- We'll be ready for the exhibition in Milan and Florence, but
we're going to have to push for Paris.

131
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
- Then push!

132
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,680
- This is my paradise. Miami.

133
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,600
- Welcome home Mr. Versace.

134
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,160
- So, what shall it be tonight? Prust?

135
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,160
- No!...

136
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,960
- Antonio, por favore, what are all those
security cameras they put everywhere?

137
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,200
Must we have them. I don't like being
spied on in my own house.

138
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,000
- Gianni, that shouldn't bother you.
Ok, ok, but I wouldn't worry about it.

139
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,560
- I never worry, except for my mother.

140
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,560
- I found it, Truman Capote.

141
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,480
- Bella... let's go to bed.

142
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
I probably not sleep

143
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,440
- You available?

144
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
- Surprise!

145
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
- What are you doing here?

146
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,400
- You don't look happy to see me.

147
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,880
- Andy, it's over.

148
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
- At least invite me in for a drink?

149
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Nice. Verrry nice.

150
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Wow, you must be doing really well for yourself.

151
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,560
- You look tired.

152
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,920
- Just came from the airport. Flying tourist with Walmart
crowd can be so exhausting.

153
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,600
Do you have some thing a little stronger
than coke and I don't mean orange juice.

154
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,920
- You kept all your bad habits or just that one.

155
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,720
Pour it yourself,
I'm getting dressed.

156
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,840
- You know I forgot something.

157
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
David, this is for you.

158
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,200
- Rolex?

159
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
- Just a thank you

160
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,040
- Thank you for what?

161
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,760
- For turning my life around.

162
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
- Did I, Andy? Did I turn your life around?

163
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
- Do you like it?

164
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
- Where'd you get it?
- I sold my Mercedes.

165
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,600
- I don't want it.

166
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,281
- Then why don't you give it to Jeffrey?

167
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,080
- Why don't you give it to him yourself?

168
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,400
- So you are still together?
- Da.

169
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,800
Andy, why do you think I left San Diego?

170
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,400
- Because you hated your life there with me and
you wanted to start a new one with Jeffrey.

171
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,320
- I couldn't stand watching your little charade, posh parties,
unpaid tabs at the expensive restaurants.

172
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,200
I just couldn't stand watching what you were doing.

173
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,640
- To you?

174
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,880
- To our friends, Andy, to yourself.

175
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,400
- Huh, well at least the sex was good.
- Come on... you know I couldn't stand that shit.

176
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
- What shit?

177
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,800
- The S&M, leather, the whips, kinky games, fits of jealous rage,
you almost choked me to death that night.

178
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,400
You're shit was out of control.

179
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,440
- So you really didn't care for me, did you.

180
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
- Andy, I did care for you.

181
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
Sky Vodka... cool.

182
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,400
- Andy, I still care about you.

183
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
- So much, that you stole Jeffrey away from me.

184
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:43,040
- I didn't steal anyone away from you.
Jeffrey couldn't stand it anymore than I could.

185
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,560
- That's not true.
- It is true.

186
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,960
The how and why it happened.

187
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,960
Andy, you don't belong here.

188
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,560
You have to go!

189
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,680
- Go where?

190
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,080
- Anywhere find your own salvation.

191
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,320
Should I even ask if you have
a place to stay in town?

192
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,120
- Well, I do now love.

193
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,120
- You haven't changed a bit have you.

194
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,520
You come waltzing in here acting the same way that
made me happy to leave you behind in San Diego.

195
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,680
What did you think you were going
to accomplish by coming in here?

196
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,400
Did you think that I was going to have missed you so much that I'd
be so grateful to have you grace me with your presence,

197
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,440
that I'd fall on my knees and thank God
we were together at last

198
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
...where are you Andy... what planet?

199
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,600
- I wish that Jeffrey was here so that both of you could nag
at me in stereo. You would like that wouldn't you?

200
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,000
- You think I'm enjoying this?

201
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,360
I cared about you. I just can't bide watching
you destroy yourself again.

202
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,080
- I guess that's as close to an I love that
I'm going to get this evening.

203
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,600
- If you have to, stay here, but,
if you're staying, stay on the sofa.

204
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
- You know the way I work, when I have an inspiration,

205
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,040
I sleep with it and, if in the morning, the thought
is still in my head, then it's worth working for it.

206
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,360
Come on, let me see.

207
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,880
What did Donatella say?
- She thinks it's fine.

208
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,600
- I think it's a little to much, Gianni!
- It is.

209
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,600
- Then it's fine. If I trust my sister, then so should you.

210
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,200
- Don't you think this is a bit too much?

211
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,640
- But Donatella... if the neckline weren't down to the ankles,
she'd think we were too conservative.

212
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,440
- What have I always told you it's never too much,
never too little, never too anything.

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
For the prices we ask, people want to buy some fun.

214
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,400
And if Madonna buys Versace, everybody buys a Versace.

215
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,440
HAl la cjnckjsv And remember it has to
be ready for the show in New York.

216
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
- Yes.

217
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,760
- Oh, and Antonio, is the cafe open?

218
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,520
- The cafe is notorious for being open 24 hours, ahh?

219
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
- Yea, right I'm still on Italian time.

220
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,600
AN, Miami

221
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,320
- Buna ziua, Gianni!
- Buna!

222
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,080
- Coriere de la serra, La repulica si Junrale.
- Here we go.

223
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Mr. Gianni, People magazine just came out and
Madonna's inside wearing your clothes.

224
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
- Bella

225
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
- Bonjourno, Sr. Versace

226
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,600
- Don't forget to roll your R's my dear.

227
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,600
- Bonjourrrrrno, Sr. Versace.
- Brava, Brava

228
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,000
- Something good?

229
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,320
- Madonna looks fantastic in a Versace.
Nu crezi?

230
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,240
- Sr. Versace it's so great to have
a star like you here with us.

231
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,200
- No, darling, I'm not a star.

232
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm just an artist who's been blessed.

233
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
A star is someone who spends half of his
life looking for success

234
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,320
...and the other half hiding behind
a pair of dark glasses.

235
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Uhhh, Shit!

236
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
- Hello.

237
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,880
<i>- Andy, un it's David. I'm going to be late tonight,
can you fend for yourself?</i>

238
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,160
- Ahh, how late?

239
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,440
<i>- Late, Late...</i>

240
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
- Jesus, David.

241
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,280
<i>- Don't get huffy, you're a guest.
We've got a lot to talk about but for now</i>

242
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
<i>let me take this at my own pace.</i>

243
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,400
- Ok, then, I guess I'll see you when I see you.

244
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,120
"La naiba omule":)))

245
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,720
<i>You've reached Jeffrey, I'm not in,
please leave a message.</i>

246
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,000
Are you still coming Jeffrey,
I REALLY want to see you.

247
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
- There he is.

248
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,840
All hands, ten but for Admiral Trail.

249
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,080
- David?

250
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,040
- And how is my admiral, hmm.

251
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
- Never quite got that far, Andy.

252
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,121
- David?

253
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Where is David?

254
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,600
- He called just a few minutes ago.
Said he was hung up at the office.

255
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,880
Is that a tired old cliche or what?
How thoughtful.

256
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,920
Let me take these off your hands.

257
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,200
Make yourself comfortable,
I know you know your way around.

258
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,800
- David?

259
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,200
...what happened to the TV?

260
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TV?

261
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,200
- Nothing serious, David just got a
little too excited last night.

262
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,320
Now tell me what have you been
doing with yourself?

263
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,080
- First, tell me what brings you to Minneapolis?

264
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,800
- What do you think?

265
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,240
Disapproval of my drinking, Jeffrey.
You were always fucking disapproving.

266
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,200
- Not disapproval, Andy, concern.

267
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,840
- You sound like David.

268
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,280
- Cause we both cared.

269
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,440
- So much that you had to leave?
- Maybe we both got sick and tired

270
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,880
...of hearing ourselves talk.

271
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,680
- Maybe you and David had more to talk
about amongst your selves.

272
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,880
- That's it! Believe what you want to believe,
about us and about yourself.

273
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
- Look, I'm sorry.

274
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,280
Please don't go.

275
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,560
Wait for David.

276
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,000
Got an idea.
Let me whip something up, spaghetti.

277
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,040
My famous spaghetti.

278
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,680
- He's not coming is he?

279
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,360
- Well, sooner or later he will.
He does live here.

280
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,720
I just wanted some time to talk.
Just the two of us.

281
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,840
You were my best friend.
Maybe the only true friend I ever had.

282
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,000
And when you left, and then when
David left, do you know how lonely felt?

283
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,360
- Not for long I'm sure.
- I deserve that.

284
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,080
Look at him. Bless by God. It's so easy for them.

285
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,400
- Don't you think you're blessed by God?

286
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,200
Andy, you have all the smarts...

287
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
- Do I have to hear this fucking lecture again?

288
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,600
- Do you know him, Versace, The King of Fashion.

289
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,280
- His clothes are shit.

290
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
- You don't like him?
- I hate him!

291
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,080
- You hate him, well I think he's great.

292
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
- I think he's shit!

293
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,200
- And you wonder why I walked out on you. This is
exactly what I'm talking about, Andy.

294
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,320
...All you want to do is hear that your
life is hunky dory.

295
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,080
You don't want a friend, just an echo.

296
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,960
You piss and moan about these people on TV having
what you don't have, but you won't work for it.

297
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,960
You'll go down on any old man with a fat wallet. Jesus,
Andy if you'd just did something with yourself.

298
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,400
You have all the gifts, you always did.
You're just too God damned lazy.

299
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,720
- Shut up!

300
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
- No, no not this time, Andy.

301
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,280
You asked me to come here,
you wanted to talk, we're going to talk.

302
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,520
You want it easy, but then you want
sympathy because life's not easy.

303
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
- Fuck you and David both!

304
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
You're two of a kind, you belong together!

305
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,560
You have your nice jobs and you're
nice places to live.

306
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:36,400
- I worked my ass to get where I am.
The naval academy and...

307
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,840
- Blah, blah, blah

308
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,440
- And so is David you want it easy don't burn
my air because you number didn't come in.

309
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,080
- Get the fuck out!

310
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,440
- Fine, but don't expect David to put up with
your crap any better than he did in San Diego.

311
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,880
You want to keep playing your poor
little me, nobody loves me.

312
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,920
You're going to be out in the cold, on your own and
I don't think you can hack it on your own.

313
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
- Oh, no!

314
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Fuck you! Fuck You! Fuck You!

315
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
...AND FUCK YOU TOO!

316
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,400
- Don't!

317
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,520
- Andy, what's going on?

318
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,120
- It's not what I wanted.
- What happened, what you do.

319
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,800
Oh my God, oh my God?

320
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,160
Cine-i ala, did you kill him?

321
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,440
- it's done you don't have to ask yourself how much you
care about me, you say you do.

322
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,920
- It's not a matter of caring, this is murder.

323
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,920
- It's a matter of killing me, David.
That's the choice.

324
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,560
- I can't kill you, that's not a choice.

325
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,920
- We all have choices, David,
and all choices have consequences.

326
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,600
...It's your decision!

327
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Breaking News Story, local residence are stunned by
the viciousness of an apparent homicide at the home of

328
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,640
prominent architect, David Madigan.

329
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,200
Sources within the police department have
revealed that as of yet they have

330
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:57,801
...not confirmed the suspect or the motive.

331
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
- Get these guys out of here!

332
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
- Everything's under control...
there's lot blood in there, go see.

333
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
- Here's my report.

334
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,320
- San Diego.
- He flew in yesterday. His name's Kunanin.

335
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,280
- Andrew Kunanin. Do we have ID reports.

336
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
- Here it is sir, his airline tickets.

337
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,600
- Long way from San Diego. Where did it happen.

338
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,000
- In the kitchen.
- Good, come on.

339
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,560
Jesus Christ,who's blood is it?

340
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,480
- There is no body, I no body was found.

341
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,880
- When we got the call, it took us
5 minutes to get here, sir.

342
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
- We know who owns the house.

343
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,240
- Well if the resident was the victim,
his name's David Madsen.

344
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
He was an architect.

345
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,960
- A resident of Minneapolis for a year and guess what

346
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,200
- He's from San Diego?
- Yup.

347
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,000
- Gay?

348
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,680
- If he is, he's still in the closet.

349
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
- Are we certain that the victim is dead?

350
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,200
- If that's his blood, he's dead!

351
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:35,401
- If he looks like this TV,
I'm sure he's dead.

352
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,400
- Question is, who was the victim...
Kunanin, Madsen, or a third party.

353
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,320
- And who called it in.

354
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,280
- A voice at a telephone from some payphone,
wouldn't identify himself

355
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,080
- Did we trace the call?

356
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,320
- We couldn't, he hung up too quick.
We couldn't get a location.

357
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,240
- This is the murder weapon sir.

358
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,840
- Jesus... violent

359
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,320
- It's Jeffrey you son of a bitch,
you killed Jeffrey!

360
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
- Now that you know how does that change things?

361
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,000
- How do you mean, how does it change things, you freak!
He was my friend, he was your friend!

362
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
- If he was my friend, he would still be alive.

363
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,880
David, do you think I could've
hurt David unless I had to.

364
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,200
- Had to, what the hell could've happened
to make you think you had to.

365
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
- David, I can't explain it to you right
now because the way you're feeling now

366
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,950
you couldn't possibly understand it.

367
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,800
All I know is that I need your help and, you have to
decide whether or not you're going to give me that help.

368
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,960
I just need a few days and then you can do
whatever you want, tell the cops anything, I don't care.

369
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Please, if we ever meant anything to each other.
- Don't pull that shit, not now.

370
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,600
- Then why don't I make it easy for you.
- No

371
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
- See you do love me... you have to help

372
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,640
The report goes on to say the police found a bag
with Kunanin's name on it and the remainder...

373
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,920
- Stupid asshole, how could you leave that behind?

374
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,800
I can't do this anymore.

375
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,600
Here are the keys, go...
I don't want to know where.

376
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,880
- Hey, David!

377
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,600
- I like fishing.
- Oh, no... Look it's a body!

378
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,600
- Let us do our job.
- Let's see what we've got.

379
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,800
- Madsen, David Madsen.

380
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
- Alright, take him away.

381
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,120
- Here's our second victim.

382
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,880
- You find him here too
- Yep

383
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,600
- Who's this? Jeffrey Gale?
- Yep that's him.

384
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,720
- So, Andrew Kunanin was in
love with David Madsen.

385
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,560
- David Madsen, 33, successful architect,
ex marine, based in SanDiego.

386
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,400
Left town about a year ago to start
his own business in Minneapolis.

387
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:50,600
- He had some kind of relationship
with Jeffrey Gale, anyway,

388
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,040
these two left San Diego and
moved to Minneapolis.

389
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Some of my investigations have led me to
believe that Kunanin may have thought

390
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,880
the relationship they were having
constituted as some sort of betrayal.

391
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,520
Anyway, the truth is we don't know what his motivation
might have been, but we're searching for one.

392
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,400
I'd like to announce now ladies and gentleman,
the beginning of anationwide manhunt for Andrew Kunanin.

393
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,200
I want to wish you all good luck.
Happy hunting.

394
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,920
Thank you.

395
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
- May I?

396
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,600
- Your tush is already in the chair... my name is Giorgio

397
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,880
...my name is Giorgio.
- Giorgio Armani?

398
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,680
- Ohh, noo, and what is your name young man?
- Gianni.

399
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,560
- Versace?
- Touche!

400
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,160
- What about AIDS, isn't that a motivation?

401
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,040
- True, we cannot discount the possibility of AIDS.

402
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,760
But there is no solid evidence
that Kunanin is HIV positive

403
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,000
and if so that that's what sparked
his revenge killing spree.

404
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:32,560
- But if that is the case, it will be easy to catch him,
we just have to find his past lovers.

405
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,800
- Even if that is the case, it doesn't
answer the question.

406
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,760
Why, why? would AIDS spark him
to be a crazed murderer.

407
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,240
I mean thousands of people have AIDS
and they don't go on killing sprees.

408
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
- Unbelievable...
here's your money.

409
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,480
Tell me when I'll see you again pal.
- In hell!

410
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,440
Only $300...
Fuck!

411
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,720
It is now certain the young man came to Minneapolis
from Southern California, probably San Diego.

412
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
The FBI is conducting a nation
wide manhunt for this man.

413
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,640
He was last seen driving through Chicago's gay
neighborhoods in a gray Jeep Cherokee

414
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,200
he allegedly stole from his previous victim.

415
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,280
This young man is known for preying on elderly,
wealthy men.

416
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,280
He is known to be ruthless and
will stop at nothing.

417
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,640
If you see this man you should call the FBI
or your local police immediately.

418
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,600
- Fuck!

419
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,640
- Stop, come back here you're stealing my car!

420
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,000
- Help, help, help

421
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,600
- You're not dead yet?

422
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
Fuck you!

423
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,720
This will shut you up!

424
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,200
Don't you know life is shit?

425
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,880
- Here you go, buddy that's one cranberry vodka,
that'll be four dollars

426
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,160
- Shit...
there's a ten.

427
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,840
- Hey buddy, don't you want change for this
- Just keep it

428
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,120
- Shit!

429
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,600
Yea, Police, this Joe from the Roadside Cafe.
I just saw that guy you were looking for.

430
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,920
Yea it was him! In a green Lexus!

431
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,760
- Hey you...

432
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,720
- Who me?

433
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,640
- Yea, is this your red truck?
- Yea, why?

434
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,080
- That's why!

435
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,800
- What can I tell you...

436
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,400
the guys got no distinguishing marks,
He can blend into any crowd.

437
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:56,401
- ... He could go anywhere,
he doesn't have any strong ties to anyone.

438
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,040
Hang on a second, that's my other phone...

439
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,400
...yea, hold on, hold on... ok,
that's my other line, I've gotta take it.

440
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,960
Yes, I got ya... go ahead.

441
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,440
Go... ok.. alright, alright,
thank you very much.

442
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
- Number 4?
- Fuckin A!

443
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,840
45 year old care taker, cemetery, William Reese,
guess what, he's not gay,

444
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,240
he's not rich... what was that word you used,
predatory...

445
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,360
- Yep... so what did he take?

446
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,240
- Just a GMC red pick up, 97

447
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,800
- The found the Lexus?

448
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,120
- Yea, outside the cemetery gate,
and he yanked out the cell phone.

449
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,200
- That's to let us know that he knows we're on to him.

450
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,720
Yea, ok, yea, I got it.

451
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,200
- What?
- The spotted a red 97 GMC truck headed south.

452
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,000
- Miami, like any big city in America
has these places...

453
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,600
...what did you call them.

454
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,920
- What, enclaves?
- Yea, enclaves!

455
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,480
- Yea, this is one the capitals of the gay
culture in the United States.

456
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,080
OH no, you have the Village in New York,
West Hollywood in Los Angeles,

457
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,840
...,
and we've got South Beach in Miami

458
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,320
- Beats the shit out of a lot of the
people you meet on 5th avenue

459
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,600
in Manhattan or Pennsylvania in D.C.

460
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
- Look at the people, they're friendly,
they're happy, they're energetic.

461
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,000
just frumos

462
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,800
I'm joining them

463
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,680
- Hey, can I get a room!
- Do you have a reservation?

464
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,240
- NO I don't have a reservation?
- What is your name?

465
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,720
- Andrew De Silva!
- How long will you stay?

466
00:49:21,721 --> 00:49:23,521
- Just one night, what's the rate?

467
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,800
- $35.73 per night, $240 a week,
you save $10 for a week.

468
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,280
- I just need it for one night!
- Ok, ok, what is your name?

469
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,800

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,680
Hello gorgeous, you do look good!

471
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,720
- Can I help you?

472
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,480
- Yea, these old coins must be worth $100
or two especially this one,

473
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,400
I think it's one of Queen Victoria's.

474
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
- Let me weigh these.

475
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,200
- Come on Can I get my fucking money?

476
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,680
- You gotta sign here, social security number...

477
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,960
...I'll be right back!

478
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,160
$200 and you've got 60days.

479
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,720
- Yea, hello police?

480
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,000
- You call the police?

481
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,440
- Yea, I did, this guy was
just in here

482
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,520
- You sure it was him?
- yea, he pawned some old coins...

483
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
- Can I see them please?
- yea...

484
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,360
...this is it right here!

485
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,240
- Don't touch it Bernie

486
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,640
Alright, I'm going to confiscate
this for evidence.

487
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,800
- I gotta receipt, that's his
signature right there

488
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,800
I'm gonna need a receipt for that.
- I'll sign your receipt!

489
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,160
- Can I help you?

490
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,080
- I'm here to see Chief Roberts

491
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Roberts, what kind of shit are you pulling?

492
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,080
We've had to wait four days for the
fingerprint report... FOUR DAYS!

493
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,320
I'm trying to conduct a nationwide
manhunt here!

494
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,360
- Gentlemen, please, calm down!

495
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,920
- You know someone could killed any moment
and you're asking us to calm down.

496
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,400
- You know what, you could be the next
fucking victim so think about it.

497
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,960
- Sir, FBI

498
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,440
- You know this man
- Yes, I know this man, De Silva

499
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,920
- De Silva?
- No, Kunanin!

500
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,920
- Whatever his name is,
he's no longer in this hotel.

501
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,400
- Can you tell us where he went?

502
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,800
- No, no I'm sorry, I don't know,
is there something else I can do for you?

503
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,600
- No nothing, we're late again

504
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,400
- Permiso?

505
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,200
- Gracias, adios

506
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,560
- Housekeeping

507
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,360
- Go away!

508
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,760
- You people are the FBI!
You're supposed to be the best!

509
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,120
I've a spree killer loose in my city and you
don't have a clue where the fucking bastard is!

510
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,160
What I really mean is, that we've got this
guy who hasn't been all that sneaky,

511
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,120
he's been walking around practically with a
sign on him that says "Me Killer, You Victim"

512
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:33,240
...still, we can't find him. You FBI honchos,
the best of best have been in town 2 weeks already

513
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,320
...and you have NOTHING, WHY, dammit, why?

514
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,920
- Why don't you tell us why, Chief?

515
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,240
- Look at this we're talking about island
that's only 7 miles long

516
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,120
with a transient population that fluctuates constantly.

517
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,880
We got tourists from all the world, we've got
a pretty high flying gay community,

518
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,960
we've got a pretty high flying straight community,
we got a large Latino immigration population

519
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,080
we're talking about a city that hasn't
looked the same two days in a row

520
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,720
- Tell me something Chief where are all the
flyers I told you to print up, huh?

521
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,520
I haven't seen a fucking flyer anywhere!

522
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
- Well, that's not exactly true, is it?
- No?

523
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,840
- Remember that it was the flyer
that alerted the Pawn Clerk.

524
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,800
- So, these fucking flyers are supposed
to be papered all over street corner,

525
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,960
warning people about this nutcase, now we
didn't even see any for at least a week

526
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,400
- There out there now!
- Good!

527
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,120
- Look, this kind of massive alarm
is just a logistical nightmare!

528
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,480
- Wait a minute...
- Oh really

529
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,320
- Law enforcement is just like every other
government agency, it's a damn bureaucracy

530
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,160
...it's what help up Kunanin's prints at the
Pawn shop, it's what help up the damn flyers

531
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,560
everything takes a long time
to get done,

532
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,000
down here in the South cause
everyone's so sun struck

533
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,440
no, everyone's so FUCKING LAZY!

534
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,600
- Listen you guys, I know the beach
like the palm of my hand and

535
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,240
I'm telling you I don't what it good it's goin
to do to paper theplace with flyers.

536
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,000
People hang out here to have
a good time gay or straight.

537
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,600
Nobody wants to hear bad news.

538
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,040
If own a club, a bar, a restaurant,

539
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,400
what the hell do you think it's going to do for your business
to hang a flyer in the window that says,

540
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:12,000
"Oh, by the way, we have a
killer lose in the neighborhood!"

541
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,600
- What can I help you with?

542
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,320
- Tuna sandwich on rye, to go

543
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,000
- Tuna sandwich? On rye? To go?
- Yea

544
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,800
- Hey, hey?

545
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,800
- Where the hell is my sandwich?
- It's coming right up

546
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
- You know what, eat it yourself,
shithead.

547
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,040
- Hey...
I know you, I seen you on TV!

548
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,720
- Carlos, I need my bill in two seconds

549
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,320
- You checking out?

550
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,480
- Yes, I'm checking out,
I'm going to Havana

551
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,880
- Sr. you don't what to go Havana,
it's a royal mess down there!

552
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,600
- Charlie, the police are here!

553
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,800
- Yea, I saw him, I saw him
- No, I saw him, I him!

554
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,920
- Who's on first?

555
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,400
- Me I saw him
- No, I did

556
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,920
- Alright, where'd he go?

557
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,200
- There's a hotel about two
blocks that way

558
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,380
- no three blocks

559
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:57,520
- Alright, thank you.

560
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,640
- I saw
- no I saw him

561
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,480
- Hurry up you stupid immigrant

562
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,600
- Ok!...

563
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,920
- This guy staying here?

564
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,600
- Yea, he just left a second ago,
and he left without paying the bill

565
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:25,120
- Where'd he go?
- To Havana!

566
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,000
- Elaine, Elaine, come over here!

567
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,760
- What is it Charlie?

568
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,480
- This young man would like to meet you

569
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,681
...this the famous Elaine

570
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,320
...and, uh,
what was your name?

571
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,120
- Andrew,
Andrew de Silva

572
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,000
- Elaine Lancaster,
Texas Lancasters, enchante

573
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,000
- It's a pleasure

574
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,600
- Set him up, Charlie!

575
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,560
- Sweetie, that figure's FIERCE

576
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,840
I know some girls that would
kill for something like that

577
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,080
RuPaul, watch out!

578
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,080
- Heellooo, try the word Goddess

579
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,960
- Honey, where are you from?

580
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Are you new here in town? You
sure look fresh

581
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,960
- Well, I'm going to the University of Miami,
Political Science.

582
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,600
I just came in to get settled before
the semester starts.

583
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,440
- OH, dorm life, don't you love it?

584
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,640
- Dorm life, oh, Ms. Thang, that's so de clase

585
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,680
I have an apartment at the Forte towers.

586
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,240
Really, I have a lot of great friends
who live at the Forte Towers,

587
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,760
...what floor are on?

588
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,440
- You know a friend set it up for
me and I really haven't been there,

589
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,640
so watch me not be able to find my own place.

590
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,880
- well listen, I've gotta go, ok

591
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,680
baby, we'll talk later or
something like that.

592
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,400
I've got things I've gotta do.

593
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,080
We can talk some other time.

594
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,600
Sure, we'll hook up.

595
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,600
This week looks bad for me, but I guarantee
you'll hear from me again.

596
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,880
- Ok, buh bye!

597
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,000
- Where'd the bitch go?

598
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,080
- Who cares! Fuckin' whore!

599
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,520
- sweetie, what took you boys so long?

600
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,240
It's been 20minutes
my God!

601
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,920
What'd you think he was going to do?

602
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Take an electric chair and wait
for you to get here?

603
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,200
- Where is he?

604
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,240
- Out killing Miami Beaches' chief
of police for all I care.

605
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,880
- I'm the fucking Chief of Police

606
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,960
- Then you'd better watch out.
- Thank you very much

607
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
- Thank you

608
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,120
- You sure it was him?

609
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,121
- Roller blades?

610
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,320
Now what would he be doing
on roller blades?

611
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,800
Come on, now do me a favor and
just stay there

612
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,280
and keep your eyes peeled, alright.

613
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,480
- Do you mind? My desk please?

614
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
- Why, of course, Chief.

615
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,680
- So, what's up?

616
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,400
- Well, we're slowly closing in on him.
- slowly?

617
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,200
What, we play low key and
hope to lure him out?

618
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,920
Or turn up the
heat and flush him out?

619
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,720
- No, now that we've got him in ou
sights I'm afraid to do anything

620
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,280
that would make him move
cause then we'll lose him again.

621
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,960
- Look this guy's desperate and he's broke
and he knows we're closing in on him.

622
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,920
I don't think he can get out of Miami.

623
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,880
I say se turn up the heat, we hit the
street and we coordinate a search

624
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,760
like Miami has never seen before.

625
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,520
- God dammit!
- What's a matter?

626
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,840
- Well, he's gotta figure we're closing in
on him and he's gotta be worried

627
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,360
- What do you mean?

628
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,600
- Kunanin loves being center stage right?

629
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,600
If he figures the show is
just about over,

630
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,160
I'm afraid he's going to plan to go out with a
big bang and makes sure the world never forgets

631
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,640
- Kunanin's room is right around the corner.

632
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,800
- Damn!

633
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,400
- We're late again!

634
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,720
Don't forget to let us know if he comes back
for his things, alright.

635
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,600
- Mario, fetch a car

636
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,240
- Mario, don't fetch a car,
we can walk to the cafe.

637
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,600
- We're going to be late
to the movies.

638
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,680
- No, we have time

639
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,600
Gianni, what is it?

640
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
-That guy on roller blades

641
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,640
... I've seen him somewhere before.

642
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,600
- You look worried.

643
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,880
- I can't explain why,
but yes,

644
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,760
I feel troubled

645
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,240
- You have no peace since you
came from Europe.

646
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,000
Gianni, I see a
constant cloud in your face.

647
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,120
-Maybe there is no peace on earth

648
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
for those who are too successful.

649
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,200
- You've seen millionsof faces
in your life...

650
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,400
- Buena sera, Gianni

651
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,880
- Welcome home

652
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
- Salud

653
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,120
It was glorious.

654
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,400
 It was like being on another planet.

655
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,000
- It is a shame you must come
back to earth.

656
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,200
- No really, earth is not that bad
...you know.

657
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,360
According to the saints and
the sages, 

658
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,600
...to belong to the earth is part of the
grand design of nature.

659
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,080
Now, don't you feel better?

660
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,200
- Here's your margarita Mr. Versace

661
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,120
- How many times have I told you
to roll your r's?

662
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,760
MARRRRGARRRITA

663
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,280
Ok, let's rush, I don't want to miss

664
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,720
the beginning of the movie.

665
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,640
- 3 for contact.

666
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,960
- $18 please

667
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,600
... thank you.

668
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,120
- Has the early show started?
- No, but it's about to.

669
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,200
- Is it crowded?
- Are you kidding?

670
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,680
On a Monday night? The three of you
could spread across six seats.

671
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,760
- Gianni!

672
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,480
- Coming

673
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,800
- Good morning, you're up early

674
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,120
- There are already people on
the beach.

675
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,000
I'm going to take my 
walk to the News Cafe.

676
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,680
Call ahead to prepare my magazines
and a couple of croissants.

677
01:11:27,681 --> 01:11:29,281
- Ok, I'll prepare breakfast.

678
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,400
- Mr. Versace!

679
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,280
I saw your Paris show on TV

680
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,800
VERY NICE!

681
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,680
I think you're out of this world,
Mr. Versace.

682
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,480
- Thank you.

683
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,640
- Bonjourno ... Mr. Versace,
here's your magazines

684
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,200
- Mr. Versace ... here's the
croissants you ordered.

685
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,880
Everything alright, you're
not smiling

686
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,680
- Ah, one of those days..

687
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,800
- You didn't walk your normal
route this morning.

688
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,200
- Maybe, I wanted to be closer
to the ocean.

689
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,400
- Ciao

690
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,520
Gianni, no

691
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:35,280
I saw him, I saw him running
that way.

692
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,400
- Where's Versace

693
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,080
- He's in number eight

694
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,200
- Somebody brought in Gianni
Versace

695
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,680
- I'm sorry, you can't be in here,

696
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:43,920
 you'll have to wait in the
waiting room.

697
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,760
I'll send out a doctor as soon as
we know anything

698
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,640
It's ok Antonio, we'll have to wait.
It'll be ok Antonio

699
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,600
- Doctor, can you tell us his
condition?

700
01:17:25,601 --> 01:17:28,120
- This is a hospital, please
quite down.

701
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,600
- Is there anybody here that's the
family of Gianni Versace?

702
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,800
- I am Antonio DeMico,
I am, I am family.

703
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
- I am Jamie Cordona,
I am family.

704
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,720
Mr. DeMico, Mr. Cordona, I am sorry
to tell you that

705
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,640
 Mr. Versace is no longer
with us.

706
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,680
- Doctor, please, can you give
us a statement?

707
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,681
- Yes, yes, I can.

708
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,960
Mr. Versace was in cardiac arrest whe
they brought him in 

709
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,920
his heart had stopped about
20 minutes before they brought him in.

710
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,400
- He was systematically brain
dead at the time

711
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,000
- Mr. DeMico, please give
us a comment.

712
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,200
- I'm sure the whole world is
waiting to hear

713
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,720
the reaction of a close 
member of the Versace family.

714
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,560
- What can I say?

715
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,240
There are no words to describe
this kind of tragedy. 

716
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,400
I am devastated.

717
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,600
My heart is bleeding.

718
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,320
I just want to die

719
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,360
- Hey, it's me Andy.

720
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,040
 I didn't know who else to call.
 I need a passport.

721
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
- <i> Andy you can't be serious.</i>

722
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,000
- It's just a passport!

723
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,720
- <i> My God Andy! Everyone in the world
is looking for you.</i>

724
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,080
- That's why I need your
fucking passport!

725
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,520
- <i> I can't Andy, I just can't!</i>

726
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,880
- Is there somebody else I can call?

727
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,480
- <i> I'm sorry Andy...</i>

728
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,360
- You don't know how sorry
you're going to be!

729
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,800
- Ladies and gentlemen, please
hold your questions.

730
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,080
The spree murderer has been identified
as Andrew Kunanin

731
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,400
...of San Diego, California.

732
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,320
Kunanin has been on the top of the FBI's most
wanted list for several weeks now.

733
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,440
I'd like to turn it over now to special
agents' John Jacoby

734
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,480
and Bernie Rogers of the FBI.

735
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,800
- Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

736
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,360
Our ballistics reports indicate
that the bullets found

737
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,880
in the body of Gianni Versace
match the ones found

738
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,480
 in the victims David Madsen of Minneapolis

739
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,800
and William Reese of New Jersey
killed earlier this month.

740
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,000
We believe that Kunanin is till on the island.

741
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,480
- How can you be so sure, Agent Jacoby?

742
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,000
- Well, for one, we have found a vehicle
in a parking garage on Collins Avenue, 

743
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:27,120
the vehicle is a red GMC pickup and belonged
to Mr. William Reese of New Jersey.

744
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:29,121
vicivsvnsdsds

745
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,000
In addition, we have been combing
Miami Int'l Airport

746
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,080
since this morning and have found nothing.

747
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,440
- WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?
WHAT IS THE FBI'S PLAN?

748
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,600
- Who's the next victim? Madonna?

749
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,680
- Very funny

750
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,080
We have a plan...

751
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,800
...a very good one.

752
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,680
Now if you'll all just be
patient,

753
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,160
we'll get information to you as
soon as it comes up.

754
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,600
Thank you.

755
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,880
- Hello...
yea, this is detective Rogers.

756
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,400
Yes mam.

757
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,800
You saw Kunanin...

758
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,480
...you saw him in, in,
in Israel.

759
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,400
I believe you.

760
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,880
Believe me, I believe you.
Would you hold on please.

761
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,880
- We don't expect to see Kunanin

762
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,200
...this guy says he saw Kunanin
 in Alaska!

763
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,400
- Hold on mam 

764
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,400
- Hey, what you doin here?

765
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,800
 GET OUT!

766
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,080
- No! You get out!

767
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,080
Shit!

768
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,600
- Yea, yea, I've got that sir.
And your phone number is?

769
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,600
- Take you time, slowly sir!

770
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,800
Speak English, please,
only English

771
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,600
- Wait, hold it sir.

772
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,160
- My name is Fernando Garrerra,

773
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,120
yes,... I am the caretaker of
the houseboat, in the beach

774
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,400
I go inside the house...

775
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,760
I walk in...
... I didn't know.

776
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,720
I look up and there's a man with a gun,
he shoots at me `Bang', I run

777
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,240
- What do you mean,
shot at you?

778
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,520
- The bullets fly over me...

779
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
- Who shot at you?
- The man in the TV

780
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,800
- Where are you?

781
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,360
- In the houseboat, in Miami Beach

782
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,880
- WHERE, WHERE!?

783
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,120
- At 5215 Collins Avenue

784
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,640
- Are you sure it was Kunanin?

785
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,600
- Alright, slow down now, please,
only English.

786
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,400
- I am telling you, he is the
man on the TV,

787
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,880
...I see all the time 2, 3
days ... he's here!

788
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,600
- Alright, alright sir.

789
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,600
We got him

790
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,840
- Fuck you...

791
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,000
...FUCK YOU ALL!

792
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,400
- I am Fernando Garrerra,
he's still inside the boat.

793
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,760
- Seems like we're late again

794
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,040
- I think you're right.

795
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,040
You guys take it in

796
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,040
...you guys stay back

797
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,120
- It's him... Andrew Kunanin

798
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,680
- God damn him!

799
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,600
- It's a Versace!

800
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,840
- You think they knew each other?

801
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,400
- I don't know.

802
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
- That's funny... I heard two shots. 

803
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
He had to be dead after the first one.

804
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,000
- Maybe somebody else killed him.

805
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
- da...Maybe ...

806
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,520
- Excuse me, I was just wondering
what you're doing here?

807
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,800
- I'm here for my Gianni.

808
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,560
- Did you know him?

809
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,920
- Yes

810
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,440
- God Bless you.

811
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,520
See what Kunanin did?

812
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,960
- Well, the way Kunanin lived,
as far as I've seen it,

813
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,960
is fuck you to people and that's
the way he died.

814
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,000
You want answers, you want to
know why, well FUCK YOU.

815
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,680
- Reason people want to know is because
you get this fear about the guy next to you,

816
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,600
right, and you wonder what could make
somebody become this kind of horror.

817
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,600
- There just looking for something, you know,
it's an omen, a danger sign, a red flag.

818
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,480
Damn!

819
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:18,200
- It's funny. It's like there
were mirror images of each other.

820
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,520
Gianni Versace was this successful,
powerful, brilliant gay man

821
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
which is everything that Kunanin wanted
to be but couldn't become,

822
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,800
so he had to do the only thing
 he knew how to do,

823
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,280
which was steal somebody else's fame.

824
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Yea!

825
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
We are people hooked on celebrity.

826
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,000
We buy supermarket
tabloids, we're addicted.

827
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,600
There's no sense to it.

828
01:28:55,601 --> 01:29:00,001
That we're more interested in movie stars,
 fashion designers

829
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,200
and tycoons than brain surgeons.

830
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:07,440
And any student of religion can tell you that
people create their own God

831
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,400
if that's kind of people we are then somebody
like Andrew Kunanin was inevitable.
