1
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:33,632
So beautiful.

2
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,508
What's that?

3
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,072
-Did you feel something?
-Yeah, I feel something.

4
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,831
Hey, get back here!

5
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,347
Turn up the music!

6
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,106
We're having a party, man.

7
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:59,672
You guys are having fun. Boat's rocking.

8
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:06,864
Stop!

9
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,946
-You're paranoid!
-Listen.

10
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,587
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,268
Listen, listen.

12
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,425
-You hear that?
-What is that?

13
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,634
Everybody, shh!

14
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,268
Stay up there.

15
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,194
What is that?

16
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:25,343
Come on!

17
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:26,026
Okay, we've had some problems
at the facility.

18
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,792
What we're attempting to achieve
has never been done.

19
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:33,510
We're this close to the reactivation
of a human brain cell.

20
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:35,030
Doctor...

21
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:39,154
...the $200 million I sunk into this company
is due in great part to your research.

22
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,112
But when the market opens Monday...

23
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,948
...despite my reputation,
I don't like heights.

24
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,191
Especially falling from them.

25
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,747
I'm sorry, honestly.

26
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:03,834
Tell me, Mr. Franklin, have you ever known
anyone with Alzheimer's?

27
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,305
Well, no.

28
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:12,787
By the end, all my father could do
was ask why my mother wasn't at home.

29
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:17,473
Each time I said she was dead,
I saw him take the loss like a car wreck.

30
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:20,752
200,000 men and women
develop Alzheimer's each year.

31
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,552
What if you could end all that suffering
with a single pill?

32
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,950
Give me till Monday morning. 48 hours.

33
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:33,674
I'll give you results
that'll skyrocket your stock price...

34
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:35,632
...or I'll help you pack the lab myself.

35
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,673
It's your call.

36
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,114
<i>That was an impressive speech</i>
<i>you gave back there.</i>

37
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:59,106
<i>I read that article on you.</i>

38
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:02,268
-<i>The thing in the Himalayas.</i>
-<i>Alps.</i>

39
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:03,784
<i>Right.</i>

40
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:09,108
<i>We were just trying</i>
<i>to do something together.</i>

41
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,868
<i>Having fun.</i>

42
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,353
<i>Things went bad.</i>

43
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,351
<i>But you saved all those people.</i>

44
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,663
<i>Not all.</i>

45
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,514
<i>Navy built it for WWII submarine loading...</i>

46
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,114
<i>...refueling.</i>

47
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:42,465
<i>When they mothballed it, we picked it up,</i>
<i>added aquatic pens, underwater labs.</i>

48
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:45,273
<i>Your dime, I guess.</i>

49
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,951
<i>Looks like Alcatraz floats.</i>

50
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:24,712
What do you think? She's a 12-footer.
She's beautiful.

51
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,990
-She wants to give you a big kiss.
-I bet.

52
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,345
She's got a license plate
jammed in her mouth.

53
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:30,908
It's a good deal, <i>amigo</i>.

54
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,354
Drop her, Billy!

55
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:49,064
Russell Franklin, Janice Higgins.

56
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,907
Marine biologist.

57
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,991
Jan will get you settled.

58
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:56,871
Welcome to our island paradise.

59
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:58,468
Where's Tattoo?

60
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,507
You know, short guy?

61
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:03,511
"The plane, Boss! The plane!"

62
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,390
Right.

63
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:08,307
I am getting old.

64
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,231
How much do you know about our facility?

65
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,748
Treat me like a tourist.

66
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:15,793
I hate tourists and I've decided
I'm going to like you.

67
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,314
"Louisiana."

68
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:36,354
I think he was bought in a pet shop
in Baton Rouge.

69
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:39,552
Ate everything in his tank,
and then ate the guy that bought him.

70
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:44,625
Next day, fills up the cab of the guy's truck
with water and drives to Baja...

71
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:48,032
...picking bones out of his teeth
with the license plate.

72
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,308
We need to talk.

73
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:53,830
Later.

74
00:09:55,355 --> 00:10:00,031
Carter Blake, Russell Franklin,
president of Chimera Pharmaceuticals.

75
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,105
That was incredible.

76
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,628
Actually, they don't like the taste
of us very much.

77
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:14,624
If they bite you, it's because
they think you're a fat little seal.

78
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:17,914
Or a rich suit.

79
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,668
Nice meeting you.

80
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,474
Friendly place.

81
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:32,945
You got full sentences.
Usually, he just kind of nods.

82
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:37,631
Word travels fast
about why you're here and all.

83
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:40,793
Was that the Gen 1 that escaped?

84
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,470
That little guy? No way.
Those are the normals.

85
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,506
These three are the test sharks.

86
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:53,544
Two first-generation
and one second-generation female.

87
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,945
Beneath its glassy surface...

88
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:04,706
...a world of gliding monsters.

89
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:10,986
It's pretty scary stuff, huh?

90
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:14,151
Yes. It is.

91
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,028
<i>Tower to water taxi.</i>

92
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:22,150
Ben, I'm picking up a nasty little bitch
of a squall about 30 miles out.

93
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,190
<i>Over.</i>

94
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,106
<i>Copy that. We'll be all right.</i>

95
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,510
Jan, stay out of the rain.

96
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,105
Where are they going? They hate me too?

97
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,346
They're going home.
We run a skeleton crew on the weekend.

98
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,790
But they probably hate you anyway.

99
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,663
There's Dr. Jim Whitlock,
the most brilliant man ever.

100
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,632
He's pissing into the wind.
How brilliant can he be?

101
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,114
You'll see.

102
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,624
What happened, deadeye?
You miss with the first shot?

103
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:11,592
It took two hits to even slow it down.

104
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:14,508
Are you kidding?
Two of these should've almost killed it.

105
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:15,948
Go tell it that, Scoggs.

106
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,664
You missed. Don't get mad at me
because you can't shoot worth a shit.

107
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:22,827
If you hadn't left the pen open,
I could've had a good sleep.

108
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:25,827
I already told the doc,
I locked the pen like I do every night.

109
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:27,871
The fish got out some other way.

110
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,554
What are you looking at me like that for?

111
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:33,347
Who are you going to trust?

112
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:36,154
Me, that's who. You trust me.

113
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,233
You know why? Because I'm trustworthy.

114
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:47,069
How high are these fences off the water?

115
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,826
Given the surface variations
and tensile strength--

116
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:54,233
Short answer, man.

117
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,544
Eight feet, give or take a centimeter.

118
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:07,431
I'm sorry. I'm making Aquatica sound
like a mental hospital.

119
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:08,994
No, not really.

120
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,872
Well, maybe a little.

121
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:13,431
The truth is, it is.

122
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,148
But almost everyone here is top
of their game.

123
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:21,712
<i>Living below is like living in space.</i>
<i>You don't get very many mistakes.</i>

124
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,673
<i>Besides the catwalks...</i>

125
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:27,828
<i>...you bought us titanium</i>-<i>based fencing</i>
<i>around all the lagoon and pens.</i>

126
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:30,953
<i>There are three sub</i>-<i>levels.</i>
<i>Sub</i>-<i>level One is living quarters.</i>

127
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,071
<i>Two: Wet lab and workshops.</i>

128
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:36,232
<i>And Three: Engineering</i>
<i>and air</i>-<i>locked wet entry.</i>

129
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,073
Welcome to Aquatica.

130
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,146
Did you dose the Gen 2 with the serum?

131
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,433
I had Carter do it as soon as you called.
It should be ready tomorrow night.

132
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,945
-But?
-We will not be ready.

133
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,746
Two months ahead of schedule.

134
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,673
We're skipping three rounds
of preliminary trials.

135
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,354
No choice.

136
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,154
You wait your whole life
for a single moment...

137
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,910
...and then one day, it's tomorrow.

138
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:56,544
So what exactly does a shark wrangler do?

139
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,994
Pretty much what it sounds like, I guess.

140
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,464
How'd you end up here at Aquatica?

141
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:04,034
I like the water.

142
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,588
Pay is good.

143
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:14,029
An AGA mask! Did some wreck diving
in one of these, off the coast of Spain.

144
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,428
Tourist thing.

145
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:20,830
Do you like wreck diving?

146
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:24,914
It's okay.

147
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:27,391
I bet you're really good at it.

148
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:33,147
We're on the water.
Whole cat-and-mouse thing don't float.

149
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,673
You're the man, right?

150
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:41,587
Yeah, I'm the man.

151
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:45,589
The man's always got a file. What's it say?

152
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,794
Two years, Leavenworth. Smuggling.

153
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,873
How'd you make your money?

154
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,714
You the first rich guy in history
who's squeaky-clean?

155
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:59,229
You do understand my concern, right?

156
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,703
Look, I got a workable deal here.

157
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:04,873
I don't make waves.

158
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,025
I meet the terms of my parole.

159
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:10,313
I'm not out to change the world,
like the doc.

160
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm not out to wreck it either.

161
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,393
Eat me, asshole!

162
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,073
Hey, you dickhead!

163
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,268
Fat butt!

164
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,073
You got a big, fat butt.

165
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:40,989
You know what, bird?

166
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:44,385
You're trying my last nerve.
Don't make me drown your feathery ass.

167
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:45,749
Get myself a cat.

168
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:49,108
That's good. Yes. That's good.

169
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:52,791
That's it.

170
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,189
You got a nasty-looking tongue,
you know that?

171
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,347
Feeding time.

172
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:14,946
<i>I'm releasing the tiger shark</i>
<i>in 30 seconds. Copy?</i>

173
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,026
<i>I hear you. I'm going in.</i>

174
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:20,827
You guys hungry?

175
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,904
Dr. McAlester, we have a situation up here.

176
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,509
Could you please come to surface level?

177
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,544
<i>Dr. McAlester, could you come</i>
<i>to surf ace level, please?</i>

178
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,905
Surprise!

179
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,190
Happy birthday!

180
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,866
Damn, I hate that song.

181
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:02,149
You like the tunes there, Preach?

182
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:10,312
Carter, join us. There's too much woman
on this deck for Scoggs to handle.

183
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:12,226
Vodka, straight.

184
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,834
And by the way,
food was excellent, brother.

185
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,392
You're that guy that got caught
in that avalanche, right?

186
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:23,824
I'm the one.

187
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,866
Black men have enough ways
to get killed...

188
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:29,425
...without climbing up some mountain
in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:32,587
You need to leave that
to the white folks, "brother."

190
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,753
Happy birthday?

191
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:43,872
I'll let you know tomorrow.

192
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,272
How's life underwater?

193
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,472
It's a lot less complicated...

194
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,906
...than it is on the surface.

195
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:54,993
That's for sure.

196
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,469
Nice work with that new tiger shark today.

197
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,115
One day, you'll have to tell me
how you learned that.

198
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:04,227
One day, you'll take me up
on that beer and maybe I will.

199
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:07,824
It's all work for me, Carter.

200
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,544
But, like you said, "One day."

201
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:15,831
Sharks never get cancer, go blind
or show loss of brain activity as they age.

202
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,227
Unlike some people I know.

203
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:22,147
Sharks are the oldest creatures
on the planet...

204
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:26,985
...from a time when the world
was just flesh and teeth.

205
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:29,588
By using a hormonal enhancer...

206
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:33,554
...we increased this female's forebrain
to five times its normal size.

207
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:35,234
To harvest more protein.

208
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,664
Exactly. A protein that may reactivate--

209
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,744
That will....

210
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:43,991
...that will reactivate human brain cells
stored in the forebrain of the shark.

211
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:48,671
I'm just amazed that we've come so far,
so fast, without genetic tampering.

212
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:53,586
Genetic engineering to increase brain mass
violates the Harvard Genetics Compact.

213
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,229
Not to mention Chimera policy.

214
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:59,791
They're hunting in packs.

215
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:02,467
Like wild dogs.

216
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:05,952
They'll only eat other sharks.

217
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,705
You're reading too much into it.

218
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,354
That Gen 1 attacked a 25-foot boat.

219
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:17,229
Am I reading too much into that too?

220
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,266
Did you tell Franklin?

221
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:24,065
I'm just a fish keeper, lady.

222
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:27,824
But bringing in that shark
ahead of schedule was a very bad idea.

223
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,632
Do you like your job?

224
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:38,271
Are you threatening me, Doc?

225
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:40,110
No.

226
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:45,388
But if we don't pull off that test tomorrow,
we're all on the street.

227
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:49,950
You're a good man, Carter.

228
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,986
But with your background....

229
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:00,063
Right.

230
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:20,546
How's Miss Smarty-Pants?

231
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:23,829
Hope she's not as dumb as she seems.

232
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,431
Raise those fences like I asked?

233
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:29,873
I took care of it. Let's go get a beer.

234
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,872
<i>US Coast Guard advisories include:</i>

235
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:45,625
<i>All</i>-<i>craft warnings for waters south</i>
<i>of the US mainland and west of CA.</i>

236
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:48,548
<i>A tropical depression is generating</i>
<i>gale</i>-<i>force winds...</i>

237
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:52,509
<i>...and is associated with heavy rains</i>
<i>and ocean swells to 30 feet or more.</i>

238
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:04,634
Any of your nonsense, and we'll have
tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight.

239
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,023
Fat butt!

240
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:08,231
That's right.

241
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:10,271
You can...all you want.

242
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,624
Welcome to my parlor, Mr. Franklin.

243
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:08,064
Wow.

244
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:14,505
<i>Wet lab, we're taking a pounding up here.</i>
<i>Can't see past my nose.</i>

245
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:17,553
<i>So I suggest you check pen monitors</i>
<i>and lagoon monitors.</i>

246
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,751
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>there's much visibility below.</i>

247
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,393
Carter, you copy?

248
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:27,635
<i>Okay, I'm approaching the tunnel.</i>

249
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,349
Bingo. Elvis has left the building.

250
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:33,148
We picked you up,
but visibility's near zero.

251
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,067
<i>No problem.</i>

252
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:19,714
How long have they been synchronized
like this?

253
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:27,991
Tell me I didn't see that.

254
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,194
They recognized that gun!

255
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:36,387
That's impossible.
Sharks can't swim backwards!

256
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:38,546
-Try to stay focused.
-What was that?

257
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,430
We lost picture in Gen 2 pen.

258
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:48,073
Okay, hold on.

259
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:27,111
Carter, do you copy?

260
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,833
Carter, do you copy?

261
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,788
Carter, talk to me, man. Do you copy?

262
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,309
Cut the crap! You're scaring everybody.

263
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:18,667
Boarding platform engaged. He's got her.

264
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,587
Did someone order the fish?

265
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:04,429
What in God's creation?

266
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:07,594
No, not His.

267
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:10,668
Ours.

268
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:23,908
Commencing scan.

269
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:29,866
Gen 2 is online.
Transferring exotics to remote terminals.

270
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,351
Vital signs to Terminal 1.

271
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:35,063
Diagnostic imaging to Terminal 2.

272
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,433
We're live and in color!

273
00:28:52,515 --> 00:28:54,585
BP, 67 over 43.

274
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:56,472
Heart rate, 50 BPM.

275
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:57,783
Within norm.

276
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,432
She's sleeping like a baby.

277
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:35,634
Bad dream?

278
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,109
In position.

279
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,233
Vitals are stable.

280
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,270
Vitals?

281
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:37,745
Holding.

282
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,554
Aspirating 4.5 cc.

283
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:19,393
Introducing 2 cc of the protein complex...

284
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:23,873
...into cultured, inactive brain neurons
of an Alzheimer's patient.

285
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,625
And what you're looking for here
is lightning in a bottle.

286
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:43,826
Protein complex is interacting
with the neurons.

287
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,750
Neurons are becoming hyperosmotic.

288
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:58,186
Membrane integrity's improving.

289
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:03,914
They're firing!

290
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,873
-They're firing!
-One second.

291
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,303
Two. Three.

292
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,545
-Still firing.
-Four. Five. Six.

293
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:13,349
6.560 seconds.

294
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,274
I'll be damned.

295
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,114
No, sir. For 6.560 seconds...

296
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:21,073
...you saw what it's like not to be damned.

297
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:23,548
Congratulations.

298
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:30,147
-Impressed?
-Overly impressed.

299
00:32:30,235 --> 00:32:31,873
6.560 seconds.

300
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:35,027
Now that you've got this...

301
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:37,993
...how long before you make
something permanent?

302
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,474
You did it, pal.

303
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:41,989
You did it.

304
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:50,944
No!

305
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:13,593
Carter, no!

306
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,068
Are you insane?

307
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,989

00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:05,434
Get to the door!

352
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,071
Come on. You can't help him.

353
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:53,907
-The door frame is bent.
-Open.

354
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:00,390
Open it!

355
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,753
Turn it! Turn it!

356
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:25,503
No!

357
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,193
Tower, can you hear me?

358
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:39,593
Anyone, hello?

359
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,195
We got to get topside, find some help.

360
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:55,225
What?

361
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:56,544
We're flooded.

362
00:41:57,355 --> 00:41:58,390
Shit!

363
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:03,105
There's no other stairway from this level.

364
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:04,630
Elevator?

365
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:07,992
It seals off automatically
to keep the shaft from filling.

366
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,108
There's no way up.

367
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:41,231
All right. Okay.

368
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:45,948
If this is a lesson about the drinking,
let's just say I've learned it.

369
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:49,312
No need to get carried away,
showing me your vengeful side.

370
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:51,232
I know Your wrath, Lord.

371
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:53,474
If Corridor B is dry...

372
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:57,668
...we go back to the maintenance ladder,
climb down to Level 3.

373
00:42:57,955 --> 00:42:59,388
We get to the wet entry.

374
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:03,184
We take the sub topside, two at a time.
We go down to get up.

375
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:07,465
All right, let's move. Come on.

376
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,108
Sounds like somebody made it.

377
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:08,629
Over here! We're over here!

378
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:15,028
Preach?

379
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:22,503
What the hell is that?

380
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:24,426
Lab equipment maybe, banging around.

381
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:25,584
Think so?

382
00:44:25,715 --> 00:44:27,034
Not a chance.

383
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:31,873
We got to get past that door.

384
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:34,392
Let's go!

385
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:45,349
Come on!

386
00:44:53,715 --> 00:44:54,989
Open the door!

387
00:44:55,115 --> 00:44:56,104
Go! Go!

388
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:28,914
Bird!

389
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,348
Come on, bird!

390
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:34,307
Where are you, bird?

391
00:45:39,995 --> 00:45:41,633
Hey, dickhead!

392
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:44,430
Bird?

393
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:47,594
Fat butt!

394
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:48,869
Bird?

395
00:45:54,555 --> 00:45:56,386
Anybody here?

396
00:45:59,035 --> 00:46:01,754
-Cowboy, let me ask you a question.
-We should keep moving.

397
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,433
I'm talking to him!

398
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:09,794
Was that a goddamn shark
that broke through that door?

399
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:10,785
I expect so.

400
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,433
You expect so?

401
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:15,034
Well, well, well.

402
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:18,664
Am I the only asshole down here
who thinks that a tad bit odd?

403
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:23,306
It can do that? Bust through a steel door?

404
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:25,987
I ain't the expert.

405
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,435
Given Gen 2's size
and some room to move...

406
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:33,144
...she could put a couple tons,
maybe more, into a hit.

407
00:46:34,275 --> 00:46:36,391
So, yeah, in my opinion.

408
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:39,149
If she wants through, she's coming.

409
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:41,067
And these sharks...

410
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:44,990
...they aren't breaking down doors
for the sheer joy of it, are they?

411
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:46,667
They're after us.

412
00:46:48,315 --> 00:46:50,909
It's obvious we don't know
what they're doing.

413
00:46:55,635 --> 00:46:58,468
What the hell did you do to those sharks?

414
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:05,991
Their brains weren't large enough to
harvest sufficient amounts of the protein.

415
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:09,429
So we violated the Harvard Compact.

416
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:15,187
Jim and I used gene therapies
to increase their brain mass.

417
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,425
Larger brain means more protein.

418
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:21,228
As a side effect, the sharks got smarter.

419
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:26,750
You stupid bitch!

420
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,665
I didn't want this to happen...

421
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:42,113
...but with this research, we could
wipe out degenerative brain disease.

422
00:47:42,795 --> 00:47:45,593
Think of the generations
that would be saved.

423
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:50,305
How much dynamite do you have to set off
in your ears before your head clears?

424
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:53,906
You wouldn't understand.

425
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:56,153
I wouldn't?

426
00:47:57,195 --> 00:48:01,108
Dumb old Carter wouldn't understand
that you used us?

427
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:05,147
That you used me?

428
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:09,673
Someone on the water
who wouldn't make waves.

429
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:12,230
Someone who wouldn't ask
too many questions.

430
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,307
Because he had something to lose.

431
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:16,067
You don't see what we've done here.

432
00:48:16,155 --> 00:48:19,545
You've taken God's oldest killing machine
and given it will and desire.

433
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:23,310
You've knocked us to the bottom
of the goddamn food chain.

434
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,589
It's not a great leap forward, in my book.

435
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:30,674
The people we'll save....

436
00:48:30,795 --> 00:48:32,751
Jim? Brenda?

437
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:35,670
Us?

438
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:39,467
All right, people.

439
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:42,547
These sharks are thinking hard and clear.

440
00:48:43,915 --> 00:48:45,712
So here's the riddle.

441
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:48,265
What does an 8,000-pound mako shark...

442
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:52,513
...with a brain the size of a V8 engine
and no natural predators, think about?

443
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:56,714
I'm not waiting around here to find out.

444
00:48:57,275 --> 00:48:59,152
Now you see how that works?

445
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:02,864
She screwed with the sharks
and now the sharks are screwing with us.

446
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,152
Please let me get out of here.

447
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:29,427
What if the sharks get through the fence
and into the ocean?

448
00:50:29,515 --> 00:50:32,393
It's okay. The fence
on the ocean side is titanium.

449
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:34,784
And it gives, so it works just like a net.

450
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:38,231
Let's get to the sub.
We'll discuss it on the way to the top.

451
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:49,753
Eat me, asshole.

452
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:55,423
Careful, now.

453
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:58,106
Come on, bird. Come on.

454
00:51:59,475 --> 00:52:00,624
Please, baby.

455
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:01,545
Dickhead.

456
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:03,626
See Daddy smiling?

457
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:05,910
Come on.

458
00:52:05,995 --> 00:52:08,190
Bring your feathery ass here. Come on.

459
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:43,790
-Explosion caused that?
-No.

460
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:48,671
Nothing in here could've blown
with enough force to move that damn sub.

461
00:52:49,755 --> 00:52:51,632
Whatever. It's junk.

462
00:52:52,195 --> 00:52:56,268
We could all just dive in
and see who makes it to the top.

463
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,593
Isn't that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie?

464
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:05,225
Just dive in.

465
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:10,065
You could go first, to lead by example.

466
00:53:10,155 --> 00:53:11,747
He was my best friend, Janice.

467
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,149
I'm not going in the water.

468
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,988
-No way, man! The sharks are in there.
-Listen!

469
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:20,348
We put these on. They help
fight hypothermia. That's a start.

470
00:53:20,515 --> 00:53:23,188
And unless someone's got a better idea...

471
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:25,106
...we're going to have to swim out of here.

472
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:46,406
This isn't happening.

473
00:54:09,657 --> 00:54:12,125
I'm not Daniel when he faced the lion!

474
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,126
So I appreciate the irony, Lord!

475
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:22,414
"Cook dies in his own oven!"

476
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:26,930
But I've got other plans!

477
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:05,135
You ate my bird.

478
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,206
Was that the surface?

479
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:21,016
No, the vibrations are too deep.
That was from inside.

480
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:32,656
I wouldn't get that close.

481
00:55:32,817 --> 00:55:34,773
Just a suggestion.

482
00:55:34,857 --> 00:55:37,291
Water's murky. We might make it.

483
00:55:37,657 --> 00:55:39,932
No way! No, we won't!

484
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:44,008
It's 230 feet...

485
00:55:44,337 --> 00:55:47,613
...from the lagoon floor
to the lagoon surface!

486
00:55:48,097 --> 00:55:50,816
The average human swims
two feet per second.

487
00:55:50,937 --> 00:55:53,770
The average shark swims
50 feet per second.

488
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:56,975
There's no way I'm getting into that pool!

489
00:55:57,377 --> 00:56:00,414
What we have here is
your basic maintenance ladder.

490
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:02,414
This leads up to the surface.

491
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:04,965
I love you, Scoggs. I really do!

492
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,090
Why do I feel a "but" coming on?

493
00:56:08,617 --> 00:56:11,450
But we don't know what shape
the surface level is in.

494
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:13,130
The shaft is air-locked.

495
00:56:13,217 --> 00:56:16,334
But if the explosion breached the shaft
at surface level...

496
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:19,056
...we won't have enough pressure
to stabilize the wet pool.

497
00:56:19,137 --> 00:56:22,891
If the pool isn't stabilized,
there's tons of ocean dying to get in.

498
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:25,687
You'll bring the whole facility down.

499
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,694
We're better off with the sharks.

500
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,206
You want to swim with your fishes?
Go ahead!

501
00:56:30,297 --> 00:56:32,686
I'm opening this door
and climbing out of here!

502
00:56:32,777 --> 00:56:35,211
-The hell you are!
-I don't work for you anymore!

503
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:37,408
-I don't have to take orders!
-Enough!

504
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:40,211
That's enough now, from all of you!

505
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:46,014
You think water's fast?

506
00:56:46,217 --> 00:56:49,573
You should see ice.
It moves like it has a mind.

507
00:56:50,777 --> 00:56:54,611
Like it knows it killed the world once.
It got a taste for murder.

508
00:56:56,137 --> 00:56:58,173
When the avalanche came...

509
00:56:58,257 --> 00:57:00,646
...it took us a week to climb out.

510
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:04,495
And somewhere we lost hope.

511
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,289
I don't know when we turned
on each other.

512
00:57:10,497 --> 00:57:11,930
I just know...

513
00:57:12,257 --> 00:57:14,851
...that seven of us survived the slide...

514
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:18,087
...and only five made it out.

515
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:23,893
Now, we took an oath
that I'm breaking now.

516
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:27,932
Swore that we'd say it was the snow
that killed the other two.

517
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:29,730
But it wasn't.

518
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:32,454
Nature can be lethal.

519
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:36,217
But it doesn't hold a candle to man.

520
00:57:38,777 --> 00:57:43,373
You've seen how bad things can get
and how quick they can get that way.

521
00:57:43,537 --> 00:57:46,005
Well, they can get a whole lot worse.

522
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:50,136
So we're not going to fight anymore!

523
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:54,655
We're going to pull together
and find a way to get out of here!

524
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,412
First, we're going to seal off this pool!

525
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,370
Oh, my God.

526
00:58:24,857 --> 00:58:26,370
It just ate him.

527
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:29,054
It just ate him. Christ!

528
00:58:30,377 --> 00:58:31,935
I'm not moving.

529
00:58:32,257 --> 00:58:34,373
I'm not moving. Someone will come.

530
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:37,255
They'll come and they'll get us,
and we'll be fine.

531
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:40,049
No. I'm not moving.

532
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:44,974
Listen, Tom, what is the precise
structural failure limit for Aquatica?

533
00:58:45,777 --> 00:58:46,892
3,200 tons.

534
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:50,970
What happens when we get more
than 3,200 tons of water in this rig?

535
00:58:54,257 --> 00:58:58,409
The support struts go first.
Their tolerance is about seven tons.

536
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:00,693
They'll crack like toothpicks.

537
00:59:00,857 --> 00:59:04,293
The walls will buckle. They can't handle
more than 10 tons of pressure.

538
00:59:11,457 --> 00:59:13,254
You want to be here for that?

539
00:59:20,497 --> 00:59:21,725
Hell, no.

540
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:28,206
The moment of truth. Again.

541
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:44,809
Go! Go! Go!

542
01:00:36,377 --> 01:00:37,492
I got you.

543
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:44,409
It's burning!

544
01:00:51,737 --> 01:00:53,329
The elevator's blocking the top.

545
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,534
If we make it to Level 1,
we can take the stairs out.

546
01:01:31,057 --> 01:01:32,456
Let's get out of here!

547
01:01:32,617 --> 01:01:34,130
Go! Go!

548
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:38,816
What are you doing?

549
01:01:38,897 --> 01:01:41,934
If they break through,
water will bring them right to us.

550
01:01:42,017 --> 01:01:45,327
Level 2 is only partially flooded.
If I can get that door open...

551
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:48,534
...the water will run off there,
buy us some time.

552
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:53,088
Big, real big.

553
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,528
-What's that?
-The size of your brass balls.

554
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:58,450
Be careful.

555
01:02:07,617 --> 01:02:08,652
Go!

556
01:03:45,737 --> 01:03:47,136
Jan, stay there!

557
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:56,290
Get me out of here, Carter!

558
01:03:56,377 --> 01:03:57,969
I don't want to die!

559
01:03:58,097 --> 01:04:00,008
Grab my hand! Come on!

560
01:04:01,577 --> 01:04:02,851
I can't!

561
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:04,411
I can't reach!

562
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:08,655
-Take it!
-I can't reach!

563
01:04:54,897 --> 01:04:56,967
Can you reach that door above you?

564
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:01,971
It's too high.

565
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:04,570
It's too high.

566
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:28,087
Sharks probably flooded that level too.

567
01:05:59,817 --> 01:06:02,729
Good thing you came to this side.
The other side's underwater.

568
01:06:02,817 --> 01:06:05,615
-We didn't exactly plan it.
-Yeah, it wasn't planned.

569
01:06:05,817 --> 01:06:07,614
Are you all that made it?

570
01:06:14,177 --> 01:06:15,496
We did it.

571
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:18,694
We're on Level 1.
We can take the stairs to the surface.

572
01:06:18,897 --> 01:06:21,013
The stairs are flooded. Trust me, I know.

573
01:06:21,097 --> 01:06:22,246
Are you sure?

574
01:06:23,697 --> 01:06:26,165
Give us a goddamn break, can't You?

575
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:38,810
He always answers.

576
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:42,854
Sometimes, the answer you get
isn't the answer you want.

577
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:49,372
We're 60 feet from the surface.

578
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:53,447
There's an emergency hatch
on this level, right?

579
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:56,411
This level has bilge pumps on it
for storm runoff.

580
01:06:56,537 --> 01:07:00,291
If we re-route the emergency generators,
we could drain a stairway.

581
01:07:01,537 --> 01:07:02,731
You sure?

582
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,535
Who you going to trust?

583
01:07:07,977 --> 01:07:09,535
-You.
-That's right.

584
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:11,130
You trust me.

585
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:22,686
We had poker here tomorrow night.

586
01:07:23,057 --> 01:07:26,527
She'd always draw to the inside straight
when she could've stuck with a pair.

587
01:07:26,617 --> 01:07:28,050
Big dreams.

588
01:07:34,937 --> 01:07:37,656
Even in death: Standards.

589
01:07:39,577 --> 01:07:43,650
Jan was a healthy girl.
Something in here has to run on batteries.

590
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:47,171
-Nice.
-Where would a girl keep her...

591
01:07:48,537 --> 01:07:49,492
...thing?

592
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:50,692
What's the matter with you?

593
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,812
My skin's starting to hemorrhage.

594
01:08:01,217 --> 01:08:03,447
The sharks smell the blood.

595
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:06,210
This'll coat it with oil.

596
01:08:06,297 --> 01:08:08,765
Look, Carter, what you said down there...

597
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:11,929
...maybe you were right.

598
01:08:13,377 --> 01:08:15,174
Everything I've done...

599
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:19,771
...I don't think I could've done it
without you.

600
01:08:20,337 --> 01:08:23,932
I know, Susan. That's the problem.

601
01:08:26,217 --> 01:08:27,616
Four a.m.

602
01:08:28,177 --> 01:08:29,405
I know.

603
01:08:29,497 --> 01:08:31,647
One night feels like a whole week.

604
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:34,011
Relativity.

605
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:35,850
What do you mean?

606
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:38,167
Einstein's theory of relativity.

607
01:08:38,737 --> 01:08:42,093
Grab hold of a hot pan,
a second can seem like an hour.

608
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:44,812
Put your hands on a hot woman...

609
01:08:45,017 --> 01:08:47,212
...an hour can seem like a second.

610
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,129
It's all relative.

611
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:57,334
I spent four years at Cal Tech. That's
the best physics explanation I've heard.

612
01:09:00,257 --> 01:09:01,485
It works.

613
01:09:03,057 --> 01:09:04,729
You stay with the doc.

614
01:09:04,817 --> 01:09:07,411
Me and Scoggs are going to try
to get to the wet lab...

615
01:09:07,537 --> 01:09:09,368
...drain that stairwell.

616
01:09:12,937 --> 01:09:14,655
-Preach?
-What?

617
01:09:16,697 --> 01:09:18,767
Would you zip me up, please?

618
01:09:48,937 --> 01:09:51,405
We got one, there's two sharks left...

619
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:54,694
...and you and the doc are doing
a little bathroom love.

620
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:57,331
They got a pill for what's wrong with you?

621
01:10:07,497 --> 01:10:11,285
I need to get some things
from my quarters. Research data.

622
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:13,534
The tests, they worked.

623
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:18,085
So much death around us,
to risk any more life for some numbers....

624
01:10:19,897 --> 01:10:24,368
Without that data, everyone dying
isn't just tragic, it's useless.

625
01:10:24,697 --> 01:10:26,927
Death is always useless, Doctor.

626
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:38,890
This is it.

627
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,368
Stay here. I'll be back before you know it.

628
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:56,170
What's going on?

629
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:58,653
What the hell's going on? What is that?

630
01:11:58,737 --> 01:12:00,011
It's okay!

631
01:12:00,337 --> 01:12:02,373
-What is that?
-We're all right!

632
01:12:02,457 --> 01:12:04,846
-What the fuck?
-It's okay.

633
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,532
I thought you were coming back for me.

634
01:12:10,817 --> 01:12:13,650
One of your monitors is blocking the panel.

635
01:12:13,857 --> 01:12:15,848
You want to help me move it?

636
01:12:15,977 --> 01:12:18,366
I say we do everything right together.

637
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:21,092
Right together.

638
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:35,813
<i>Hello.</i>

639
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:39,447
My name is Sherman Dudley...

640
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:43,891
...and if this message finds you,
I did not survive, so this is my legacy.

641
01:12:44,897 --> 01:12:48,253
<i>I have loved the pulpit</i>
<i>and I have loved the bottle.</i>

642
01:12:49,137 --> 01:12:52,607
<i>I did my best to be a good husband,</i>
<i>a f ather.</i>

643
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,329
I came up wanting.

644
01:12:56,377 --> 01:12:58,652
So what do I have to say to you?

645
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:02,366
What mark do I have to leave behind?

646
01:13:08,137 --> 01:13:11,413
<i>We'll begin with the perfect omelet,</i>
<i>made with two eggs, not three.</i>

647
01:13:11,497 --> 01:13:14,534
<i>Amateurs often add milk for density.</i>
<i>This is a mistake.</i>

648
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:45,011
Come on!

649
01:16:16,497 --> 01:16:18,294
I got you. Come on.

650
01:16:31,577 --> 01:16:33,169
Damn you, Scoggs.

651
01:16:43,657 --> 01:16:45,090
Where's Susan?

652
01:16:47,617 --> 01:16:48,606
I'm done.

653
01:16:48,697 --> 01:16:52,167
Brothers never make it out
of situations like this. Not ever!

654
01:20:44,217 --> 01:20:45,570
Did you do it?

655
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:47,056
Where's Scoggins?

656
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:52,736
I hate to interrupt this moment
of burgeoning intimacy...

657
01:20:52,817 --> 01:20:54,569
...but can we get the fuck out of here?

658
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:07,054
-Is this the only way?
-Exits are flooded.

659
01:21:07,177 --> 01:21:10,567
Whole place is sinking.
It's this way or no way at all.

660
01:21:11,497 --> 01:21:13,806
You can bring on the good news
anytime now.

661
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:17,527
Sharks are attracted to churning water,
bright colors.

662
01:21:17,857 --> 01:21:20,291
These extinguishers will be a distraction.

663
01:21:21,617 --> 01:21:23,016
What about us?

664
01:21:23,097 --> 01:21:26,692
The vest'll bring you up too fast.
Your lungs'll pop like a balloon.

665
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:30,008
You weren't the sunny kid in your class.

666
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:31,889
I never went to class.

667
01:21:32,857 --> 01:21:35,246
How far to the surface? Sixty feet?

668
01:21:35,337 --> 01:21:36,372
There's nothing to it.

669
01:21:36,457 --> 01:21:39,893
Exhale on the way up,
and get the hell out of the water.

670
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:44,294
I got to equalize the pressure
before we blow the air lock.

671
01:21:45,257 --> 01:21:47,612
I got to let the room fill up with water.

672
01:21:48,457 --> 01:21:50,732
It'll only take a few seconds.

673
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:53,050
You ready?

674
01:21:54,137 --> 01:21:55,126
No.

675
01:21:56,057 --> 01:21:57,092
Not in the least.

676
01:22:15,377 --> 01:22:18,096
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

677
01:22:18,177 --> 01:22:19,656
"...I shall fear no evil...

678
01:22:19,737 --> 01:22:21,136
"...for Thou art with me...

679
01:22:21,217 --> 01:22:23,526
"...Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

680
01:22:23,657 --> 01:22:27,809
<i>"Surely goodness and mercy shall</i>
<i>follow me all the days of my life... "</i>

681
01:22:28,097 --> 01:22:29,974
<i>...because I carry a big stick...</i>

682
01:22:30,057 --> 01:22:32,571
<i>...and I'm the meanest motherfucker</i>
<i>in the valley.</i>

683
01:22:32,657 --> 01:22:35,729
<i>Two sharks down, Lord.</i>
<i>One demon fish to go.</i>

684
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,216
Can I get an "amen"?

685
01:22:37,297 --> 01:22:38,093
Amen!

686
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:40,407
-I can't hear you!
-Amen!

687
01:22:41,297 --> 01:22:42,525
Give me an "amen"!

688
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:44,568
-Stay with us, Lord!
-Amen.

689
01:22:47,537 --> 01:22:49,767
Okay, hold on three! Ready?

690
01:22:50,017 --> 01:22:52,053
One! Two! Three!

691
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:25,451
Swim!

692
01:25:01,937 --> 01:25:03,211
Oh, my God!

693
01:25:39,537 --> 01:25:41,368
It's the devil, you know.

694
01:25:52,257 --> 01:25:54,851
He'll be okay if we can get out of here.

695
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:07,850
Son of a bitch.

696
01:26:08,257 --> 01:26:09,212
What?

697
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:13,615
Those fences are titanium underneath,
but on top, they're just plain steel.

698
01:26:15,897 --> 01:26:18,809
They've been herding us,
pushing us where they want.

699
01:26:18,897 --> 01:26:21,127
Using us to flood the facility.

700
01:26:23,257 --> 01:26:24,736
Oh, my God.

701
01:26:25,537 --> 01:26:27,255
That's the answer to the riddle.

702
01:26:27,337 --> 01:26:30,170
Because that's what
an 8,000-pound mako thinks about.

703
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:32,930
About freedom.

704
01:26:34,737 --> 01:26:36,773
About the deep blue sea.

705
01:26:39,617 --> 01:26:41,335
We have to kill her.

706
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:46,813
That's the first real smart thing
you've said all day.

707
01:26:51,177 --> 01:26:52,371
Here we go.

708
01:27:09,177 --> 01:27:10,656
Let's go.

709
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:24,252
We ought to get 2.5 sticks of dynamite
out of these flares.

710
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,137
From up here, you ought to be able
to see me spear it.

711
01:27:32,217 --> 01:27:34,811
When I do, you take this end of this cable...

712
01:27:34,897 --> 01:27:37,570
...hook it up to the positive side
of the boat battery.

713
01:27:37,697 --> 01:27:39,016
And boom!

714
01:28:14,297 --> 01:28:16,413
Damn! I can't get her!

715
01:28:16,697 --> 01:28:18,449
She's too far away!

716
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:22,208
I know how to get her.

717
01:28:22,537 --> 01:28:23,606
How?

718
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:25,932
Bait.

719
01:28:39,777 --> 01:28:42,291
She may be the smartest animal
in the world...

720
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,806
...but she's still just an animal.

721
01:28:46,297 --> 01:28:47,650
Come to Mama.

722
01:29:01,017 --> 01:29:02,166
No!

723
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:07,571
Susan, don't!

724
01:29:23,217 --> 01:29:24,809
Get out of the water!

725
01:31:14,657 --> 01:31:16,090
All right, Lord....

726
01:31:16,177 --> 01:31:17,769
Shoot it, Preach!

727
01:31:17,857 --> 01:31:19,415
This is for Scoggins.

728
01:31:19,497 --> 01:31:20,566
Shoot it!

729
01:31:27,377 --> 01:31:28,571
Damn!

730
01:31:33,857 --> 01:31:36,052
Blow it, Preach! Blow it!

731
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:37,685
The battery!

732
01:31:37,817 --> 01:31:39,045
Blow it!

733
01:31:43,017 --> 01:31:44,530
Do it!

734
01:32:44,177 --> 01:32:45,895
Bring me some sushi!

735
01:33:09,937 --> 01:33:11,529
Forty-five-foot shark...

736
01:33:11,737 --> 01:33:13,375
...and you hit me.

737
01:33:13,697 --> 01:33:14,732
Nice.

738
01:33:15,617 --> 01:33:18,609
Could've been worse.
I could've let him eat your ass.

739
01:33:25,617 --> 01:33:27,608
Carter, we're sinking, right?

740
01:33:28,137 --> 01:33:29,365
Yeah.

741
01:33:30,097 --> 01:33:32,088
Let me ask you something.

742
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:35,726
Are you sure it was just three sharks?

743
01:33:36,137 --> 01:33:37,172
Yeah.

744
01:33:47,057 --> 01:33:48,854
That's more like it.

745
01:33:56,657 --> 01:33:58,693
Here comes the next shift.

746
01:33:59,577 --> 01:34:01,169
Let me tell you, man...

747
01:34:01,457 --> 01:34:03,209
...I quit this job.

748
01:34:07,217 --> 01:34:09,412
Take me back to the ghetto.

749
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,211
Amen.

750
01:40:41,217 --> 01:40:44,209
