1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,871
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,

2
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:18,000
We wish you a merry Christmas
- Hey! Wait a minute!

3
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,733
- What?
- Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

4
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:22,954
- Yeah, I think so. - Dude, Jewish
people don't celebrate Christmas!

5
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,858
- What? - You're supposed
to sing Hanukkah songs!

6
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:28,993
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,

7
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:32,320
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
- If we had that-- stupid song.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,290
- Yeah, Hanukkah sucks.
- Don't you oppress me, fat boy.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't call me fat, buttfucker.

10
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:41,000
Then don't belittle my
people you fuckin' fatass

11
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,910
Goddammit don't call me fat
you buttfuckin' sonofabitch!

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
What the-?

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:54,412
- Behold my glory.
- Holy shit, it's Jesus!

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,625
What are you doing
in South Park, Jesus?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,258
I come seeking... retribution.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,112
He's come to kill you
cuz you're Jewish, Kyle!

17
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:05,066
Oh, fuck! I'm sorry,
Jesus. Don't kill me.

18
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,382
May, fear not.
I love all My children.

19
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:13,056
- Whew. - Tomorrow is my
birthday. Yet all is not right.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,700
Your birthday is on Christmas?
That sucks, dude.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,092
I must find a place
called "The Mall".

22
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:22,219
- Well we can take you to the mall, Jesus.
- Yeah! It's over this way.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,227
Eugh! Goddammit, you stepped
on my foot you pigfucker.

24
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,790
Dude, don't say pigfucker
in front of Jesus.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,013
Eh, fuck you.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Here we are Jesus, South Park
Mall. Who are you looking for?

27
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:42,306
- Him! - Ho ho ho.
We meet again, Jesus.

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,343
You have blemished the meaning of
Christmas for the last time, Kringle!

29
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:49,800
I bring happiness and love
to children all over the world.

30
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,139
Christmas is for
celebrating my birth!

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,297
Christmas is for giving!

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,871
I'm here to put an end
to your blasphemy!

33
00:01:56,872 --> 00:02:00,897
This time we finish it.
There can be only one!

34
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,250
Dude, this is pretty
fucked up right here.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,834
Go Santa!

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,044
Uh, go Jesus!

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,100
Chung kwang do!

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,300
Yoktuki!

39
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:40,292
Oh my god! They killed Kenny!

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,870
- Come on, you son of a bitch!
- Come on! Come on!

41
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:46,099
Boys, help me put an end
to him once and for all.

42
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,946
No, boys, help me, so that
I can put an end to him.

43
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:52,409
God is watching you, boys.
You know who to help.

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,358
Stan, remember the choo-choo
when you were three?

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,563
I died for your sins, boys.
Don't forget that.

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,952
I don't know what to do,
dude. Who should we help?

47
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,422
I say we help Santa Claus.

48
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,349
Aw, you're just saying that
because he brings you candy.

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,524
Hey! I don't need to take
that kinda shit from a Jew.

50
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,736
You're such a fat fuck, Cartman,
that when you walk down the street

51
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:15,259
people go god DAMMIT
that kid's a BIG FAT FUCK.

52
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,662
- Oh yeah? Well, at least I'm not a--!
- Shut up!

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,331
Wait, wait, wait just a second.
Now we've got to think here.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,300
Now let's see. What
would Brian Boitano do?

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,400
Yeah. What would
Brian Boitano do?

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,164
Did someone say my name?

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,916
- Brian Boitano!
- What incredible irony!

58
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,201
- Yeah, it's Brian Boitano!

59
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,486
- What's going on, kids?

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,761
Okay, Brian? Who would you help
in a fight, Jesus or Santa Claus?

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,538
Kids... you shouldn't
think of things like that.

62
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,824
This is the one time a year in
which we all try to get along,

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,728
no matter what we believe in.

64
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,348
This is the season just to be
good to each other.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Bye-eee!

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,920
- C'mon, lumberboy!
- You fuckin' pussy!

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,390
Hey, Jesus!

68
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:05,394
You have to understand that Santa is
keeping the spirit of your birthday alive

69
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:08,599
by bringing happiness and joy.
- Yeah. And Santa,

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
you need to remember that
if it weren't for Jesus,

71
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,500
this day wouldn't even exist!

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,475
You're right kids. I'm sorry Jesus.

73
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,154
No, no. It's me who should be sorry.
I've been a right bastard.

74
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,740
- I'm sorry Kringle.
- Thank you boys.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,255
Yeah, thank you boys.

76
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:27,885
Come on, Kringle, I'll buy
you an Orange Smoothie.

77
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,991
- Whew. That sucked.
- Yeah, but just think.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,338
Today we actually met-- we actually
spoke-- to the Brian Boitano.

79
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:41,527
Yeah. And you know? I think
I learned something today,

80
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,599
It doesn't matter if you're Christian
or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Christmas still is about one
very important thing:

82
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,200
- Yeah, ham.
- No not ham, you fat fuck!

83
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,000
- Fuck you!

84
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,818
...Christmas is about something
much more important!

85
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,470
- What?
- Presents

86
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,220
Don't you see
Kyle? Presents

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,500
Hey man, if you're Jewish you
get presents for eight days.

88
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,650
- Wow, really? Count me in.
- Yeah, I'll be a Jew too.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,100
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay

90
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,500
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!
