Oh, that sucks
what she did to you.

20
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,846
Um, the winery

that road right there

Have you met that new
chick in town, Caroline?
Not interested.

34
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:39,810
I'm not saying
you gotta marry her, Jake.
Just go have some fun.

35
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,248
I don't wanna be
set up, Pete.

36
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,424
My divorce isn't
even final, yet.

37

Come on,
it's one dinner.

38

she'd even go out
with me?

00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,040
<i>Because she already</i>

40
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,999

No, I look stupid.

49
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,895
You think
I should shave?

50
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:24,681
Fine, I'll shave.

Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's a long story.

00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:24,219

00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,531
No, no.
No, it's not that.

73
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,883
She cheated on me.
That was--

74
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,102
Oh, right!
I heard that.

75
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,583
They were making fun
of you on Leno.

She was a massage therapist
and a yoga instructor.

90
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,544
That is a sure thing.
What did you do wrong?
Nothing!

91
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:41,720
You talked about Amanda
all night, didn't you?

92
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:43,940
She asked me about her.
What am I supposed
to do, lie?

93
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:46,334
Yes. Yes, you're
supposed to lie.

94
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,510
Jesus!
How did you get married
in the first place?

95
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:50,991
Amanda said she liked me
because I was real.

96
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:53,428
That is so sweet.

97
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,909
What do you think?
What do I think?

98
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,172
I think you named it
after Amanda's favorite
flower.

99
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:00,522
Lots of people
like hyacinths.

100
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:03,394
People like tulips and roses.
Nobody even knows what
a hyacinth is.

101
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,007
Besides, that is

Oh, crap!

104
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:12,577

So,

110

your father left you
a rather large
inheritance.

111
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,516
Inheritance?
How much?

112
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,519
About 500,000.
<i>Oh, my.</i>

<i>Minus signs.</i>

121
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:37,592
Like <i>very</i> negative.
Your father left you
a rather large debt.

What-what do you
mean a debt?

123
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,207
This is not a debt.

You're asking people

<i>When this ad comes out,</i>

152

What do you
think, Mr. Jake?

175
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,572
I think we're taking
another picture.

176
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:14,618
Why is that funny?
Why are you laughing?

177

<i>It turns out someone</i>
<i>lives in the house.</i>

179
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,595
His name is Sullivan.
That's all I could
find out.

180
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:30,727
I managed to wrangle
an e-mail address

181
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,990
from the county clerk
there in Webster.

182
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,732
<i>How-how can he live</i>
<i>in a house that's</i>
<i>not his?</i>

183
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,821
How can he do that?

184
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:40,084
I don't know, but
it does make things
more complicated.

185
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:42,435
<i>You can't sell it</i>
<i>if he's in there.</i>

186
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,047
<i>And if he won't move,</i>
<i>you'll have to evict him.</i>

187
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,790
If you like,
I could send
a letter.

188
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,227
<i>No, you know,</i>
<i>I can handle that.</i>

189
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,144
I think I can write him
an e-mail explaining
everything.

190
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,276
He'll understand, right?

191
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,454
<i>Hey, use a little help</i>
<i>here, handyman.</i>

192
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,368
One second
there, Sheriff.

193
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:05,370
Come here,
take a look at this.

194
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:09,200
So, you think
this is the real deal?

195
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,376
<i>No, that's one</i>
<i>of those scam things.</i>

196

And he's probably
a brushing hacker
in his mum's basement.

197
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:16,469
Best thing you can do
is just ignore it.

198
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:23,476
And voila!

handy with tools?

00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:18,200
Yes, we have beds
but we're really
rough around the edges.

343
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:22,074
We come from Japan.

344
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,380
Oh, that's great.

345
00:28:24,424 --> 00:28:27,296
Sam and Tracy Okata.

346
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,733
Hi. We come
from Japan.

347
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,794
Mm, smell that
fresh clean air.

348
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,320
[gasps]

349
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:53,670
I love
this place all right.

350
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:56,325
Don't be silly.
It's supposed
to be lucky.

351
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,588
What is it
a bed and breakfast?

352
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:00,286
<i>Somewhere to stay.</i>

353
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:02,157
You think
it's a good idea?

354
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,899
It is your house,
isn't it?
Yeah.

355
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:08,120
It is our
honeymoon.

356
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,645
Oh, con--
Congratulations.

357
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:13,647
Okay, you know?
I'll tell you what.

358
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,605
Why don't you guys
take the first one

359
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:18,782
on the right side
as you get up the stairs?

360
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:20,958
Can I help you
with your luggage
or anything?

361
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:23,265
Sure?
Sayonara.

362
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,833
<i>Okay, sayonara.</i>

363
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,584
Hi.
Hey.

364
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:40,978
Um, are you here
for a room?

365
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:44,373
Well, this is a bed
and breakfast, isn't it?

366
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:49,465
Yeah, yes, sir.
Well, almost.

367
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:52,120
I guess officially
now, yeah.

368
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:56,516
I'm Victor.
Victor Garcia.

369
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,954
This is my beautiful
wife, Sonia.

370
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,477
<i>We live in Spain,</i>

371
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:04,828
and we are here
to savor the local wines.

372
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:08,658
<i>I'm Jake Sullivan.</i>
<i>This is my place.</i>

373
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:11,270
<i>And welcome.</i>
<i>Please, come on in.</i>

374
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:14,098
<i>Ah, so, you are</i>
<i>Jake Sullivan?</i>

375
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:15,970
Yes, I am. Yes.

376
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:19,713
Uh, may I ask what
is a hyacinth house?
What is it?

377
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,758
Uh, hyacinth.
A flower.

378
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:24,587
<i>So, how long will you</i>
<i>be staying with us?</i>

379
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:27,764
<i>Just one night.</i>
<i>Possibly two.</i>

380
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:31,899
Yeah, and we want
twin beds, please.

381
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:35,032
He snores.
Kills me.

382
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,512
Yeah.

383
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:41,343
You?
This man
is a <i>lunatic.</i>

384
00:30:41,387 --> 00:30:44,346
You ought
to be in jail
the way you drive.

385
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,043
You two know
each other?

386
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,132
Yes, but we got off
on rather the wrong foot.

387
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:51,962
He means he almost
ran over my foot.

388
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:56,358
This is Maria.
Maria, this is Sonia
and Victor,

389
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:58,534
and they are guests
from Spain.

390
00:30:58,578 --> 00:30:59,927
<i>[talking in Spanish]</i>

391
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:06,281
Yes. Always.

392
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:09,676
I didn't know
you were such
a <i>dynamic</i> woman.

393
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:12,244
Please.

394
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,333
I am not that
easily charmed.

395
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,424
<i>(Jake)</i>
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

396
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,382
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'm gonna get a key.</i>

397
00:31:20,426 --> 00:31:23,167
Your room will be
the third door on
the right up the stairs.

398
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:24,386
That's the one
with twin beds.

399
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,040
<i>Luggage or anything?</i>

400
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,390
No, no,
we're okay.

401
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:30,958
Is there a real estate
lawyer in town?

402
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:34,004
Uh, yes,
Hank Simmon's office,
right in the middle of town.

403
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,572
Are you interested
in buying some property
here in Webster?

404
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:38,487
We're here
just checking
the value--

405
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,533
Sonia, darling.

406
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:43,275
It's time
for my siesta.

407
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,103
Yeah. Okay.
Thank you.

408
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,236
Certainly.
Thanks.

409
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,282
Oops!
Okay.

410
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,024
We're not
completely finished.

411
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:55,287
<i>[laughter]</i>

412
00:31:58,115 --> 00:31:59,334
Maria?

413
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,683
Maria!

414
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:08,822
I think I'm going
to like it here.

415
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,478
I warned you
when you hired me.

416
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:13,653
I'm not much
of a cook.

417
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,528
Maria, till we get
this place up and running,

418
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:22,879
<i>we're all gonna have to do</i>
<i>a little bit of everything.</i>
<i>What is that smell?</i>

419
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:25,882
It's <i>menudo,</i>
the only breakfast
I know how to make.

420
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,020
As soon as I can,
I'll hire a chef.

421
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:39,156
So...what
did you think
of that couple?

422
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,724
<i>The woman's sexy,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

423
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:43,944
I didn't notice.
You noticed.

424
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:46,642
She's married, okay?
So let's not even
think about it.

425
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:49,819
The man, he seems
a little, um, what's
the saying?

426
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:53,083
Light in the loafers.
Seemed European to me.

427
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:55,651
That's another thing.
I don't think they're
from Spain.

428
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:57,610
I don't even think
he understands Spanish.

429
00:32:57,653 --> 00:33:00,613
Maria, when this place
gets up and running,

430
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:02,876
<i>we're gonna have</i>
<i>a lot of guests</i>
<i>coming through here.</i>

431
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:05,226
I don't need you
passing judgment
on everyone.

432
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:07,228
But I like
to pass judgment.

433
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:08,621
Maria, no.

434
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,929
Ugh, that's bad.

435
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,413
<i>(Ana)</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>
<i>It's closed.</i>

436
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,110
What do we do?

437
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:22,852
Take in some local color.

438
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:24,419
Oh!

439
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,335
This!
This is the store
of my dreams.

440
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,163
Let's buy
some clothes.

441
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:31,992
You're joking, right?
No way I'm getting
in there.

442
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,515
Oh, I am.

443
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,038
Victor!

444
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:36,257
Victor, please--

445
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,693
Howdy, partner?
[laughs]

446
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,397
[sighs]

447
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,095
<i>[tinkling]</i>

448
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,926
[tinkling]

449
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,518
Oh.

450
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,737
Oh, yes!

451
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,001
Phones will ring--

452
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,529
<i>[doorbell chimes]</i>

453
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:43,977
Howdy!

454
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,761
[laughs]

455
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:48,068
Ooh, where on earth
did you get those clothes?

456
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,853
Fabulous little shop
right here in Webster.

457
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:52,899
Now, maybe
you can help me.

458
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:55,205
Is there
a cowboy bar in town?

459
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:57,643
Yes, along
the highway.

460
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:02,299
But I don't know
if we have the kind
of cowboys

461
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:04,388
you're looking for.

462
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:07,696
What do you mean?
I mean, what other kind
of cowboys are there?

463
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:20,187
There's only one
channel on the TV.
Static.

464
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,624
And there's no
cold water in
the shower,

465
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:24,844
no hot water
in the sink.

466
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:28,195
There's a hole
in the floor where
the toilet should be!

467
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:31,154
Oh, I am so sorry.

468
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,982
I forgot to put
a toilet in your room.

469
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:36,682
I don't mind.
It reminds me
of Italy.

470
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:40,860
Mr. Sullivan, I don't know
what kind of operation you
think you're running--

471
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:42,644
I'm so sorry.
I apologize.

472
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:44,428
Why don't you guys
take the rest of the day,

473
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,430
<i>go tour the winery,</i>
<i>on me, of course.</i>

474
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:50,173
And when you return,
I promise everything
will be fixed.

475
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,436
That sounds wonderful.

476
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,830
<i>Listen, don't you think--</i>
<i>They probably</i>
<i>have bathrooms.</i>

477
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:56,658
<i>Yes, they have.</i>

478
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,705
I'm sorry.

479
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,230
Hello.
Hi.

480
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,845
Hey!
Hello, baby!

481
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:11,586
<i>Oh, he likes you.</i>

482
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,022
What's his name?

483
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:15,721
This is Kevin.

484
00:36:15,764 --> 00:36:18,071
I've always wanted
to have a dog like this.

485
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:21,901
Oh, no, no, no.
He doesn't know he's a dog.
He thinks he's my brother.

486
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:24,686
[laughs]
Me and my brother
were never that close.

487
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,297
Oh. Well, hey,
would you like
something to drink?

488
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:29,343
Some water perhaps?
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

489
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:31,867
<i>Thank you.</i>

490
00:36:31,911 --> 00:36:35,218
Okay, um,
can I just
ask you something?

491
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:36,698
Sure.

492
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,265
How long have
you owned this place?

493
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:39,396
Ah, a couple
of years.

494
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,573
You, you bought it?

495
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,315
No, it was given to me.
It was left to me
by a friend

496
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,535
when she passed away.

497
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,584
Oh. It seems like
an unusually generous gift
for a friend, isn't it?

498
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:57,153
Yeah, well, I was
her handyman for
a number of years.

499
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:59,765
And, well, we got
very, very close.

500
00:36:59,808 --> 00:37:01,984
You weren't, I mean--

501
00:37:02,028 --> 00:37:04,291
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

502
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,598
I'm sorry I asked.
She was 80 years old.

503
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,992
Oh!
No, absolutely not.

504
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:13,779
I don't wanna be rude,
but how did it get in such
awful shape?

505
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,911
It-it was left
for a long time.

506
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:18,261
And obviously I'm still
fixing things up.

507
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:20,742
In fact, we aren't supposed
to be open right now,

508
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:23,092
but the ad had
the wrong date on it, so.

509
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:26,748
What ad?
The advertisement
in the magazine.

510
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,184
How did you guys

00:47:55,115 --> 00:47:58,379
Put your clothes on, sister.
We dress for breakfast
in this country.

682
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:09,738
What are you
looking for, Mr. Jake?
Flo's will.

683
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:14,482
Miss Hank took all
the important papers
to keep them safe.

684
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:16,919
Safe from what?

685
00:48:16,963 --> 00:48:19,444
Safe from you.

686
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:23,099
Fine. I'll go
to her office then.

687
00:48:23,143 --> 00:48:26,102
Not without me.
I want this resolved now.

688
00:48:26,146 --> 00:48:27,974
Fine.
Right now.

689
00:48:34,197 --> 00:48:39,028

00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:43,816
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for being my friend through</i>

691
00:48:46,253 --> 00:48:47,820
May I see?

692
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:56,437
<i>This is hardly</i>
<i>a legal document.</i>

693
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:59,179
<i>It isn't even notarized.</i>

694
00:48:59,222 --> 00:49:03,314
<i>Although I must say</i>
<i>the stationery is</i>
<i>rather lovely.</i>

695
00:49:09,189 --> 00:49:11,365
Uh, this clearly
won't stand up
in a court of law.

696
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:13,672
What?

697
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:16,065
I don't know how
you do things
in Mexican court.

698
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:17,893
Brazil.

699
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:19,460
Tomato, tomato.

700
00:49:19,504 --> 00:49:21,201
<i>Jake, this is perfect.</i>

701
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:23,638
He's got you there, Jake.

702
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:27,468
<i>Without an official will,</i>
<i>property goes to the nearest</i>

703

Me.
<i>What?</i>

704
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:31,951
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

705
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:34,997
Well, it just seemed
something better left
alone at the time.

706
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:38,566
Who would think that
somebody was crawling out
of the woodwork?

707
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,787
<i>Okay, great.</i>
<i>Now we can sell the house</i>
<i>and get the hell out of here,</i>

708
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,356
if we can ever
make it presentable.
Okay, let's go.

709
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:48,620
This is ridiculous.

710
00:49:48,663 --> 00:49:51,362
<i>I'm sorry, Jake.</i>

711
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,538
We'll fix it.

712
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,020
Hey, I could kill him.

713
00:49:58,064 --> 00:49:59,674
Pete.

714
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:02,242
It's just an option.
Just saying.

715
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:05,332
[tinkling]

716
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:10,337
Well, I think now
I can buy something
for...for my house.

717
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:11,817
Ah!

718
00:51:02,868 --> 00:51:05,087
Hey.

719
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:10,615
I just wanna tell you
I did not come to America
to cause you trouble.

720
00:51:10,658 --> 00:51:14,532
And...we need
to discuss how
to proceed.

721
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:16,447
You don't have
to be out just yet.

722
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,493
Why don't you rent
the house to me?

723
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:21,452
I'll pay you
what I can upfront,

724
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,715
and then as soon
as the business
gets up and running,

725
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:25,499
you'll make your
money back quickly.

726
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:27,283
I would if I could,

727
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:31,853
but...I need a full
amount and I need it now.

728
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:34,726
Flo may have been
your grandmother,

729
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:36,902
but she was my friend.

730
00:51:36,945 --> 00:51:39,121
If she wanted you
to have the house,

731
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:42,168
she would have
left it to you,
you know.

732
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:44,300
In the whole time
that I knew her,

733
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:46,781
she never even mention
that she had a granddaughter.

734
00:51:46,825 --> 00:51:50,089
She never talked
about any family
at all, ever.

735
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:52,787
Of course, because
I never got to meet her.

736
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:54,746
She-she married
an American.

737
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:57,009
She left Brazil
before I was even born.

738
00:51:57,052 --> 00:52:00,708
Now, I know my will
is not official,

739
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:05,017
but I have no doubt
that Flo wanted <i>me</i>
to have this house.

740
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:08,847
I don't blame you
for feeling this way,

741
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,155
but...it still
doesn't change anything.

742
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,636
I you think
I'm just gonna
give up

743
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,509
and roll over,
you can forget
about it.

744
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,032
I'll fight you.

745
00:52:22,513 --> 00:52:24,036
And you will lose.

Wake up.
We found something
in the law you're gonna love.

751
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,860
Because she hasn't lived
here in years and hasn't paid
any of the property taxes,

752
00:53:05,904 --> 00:53:08,210
<i>you can have</i>
<i>this place over again.</i>

753
00:53:08,254 --> 00:53:10,038
<i>You just have to go</i>
<i>and pay the taxes</i>

754
00:53:10,082 --> 00:53:11,910
<i>and you don't even</i>
<i>have to pay them all.</i>

755
00:53:11,953 --> 00:53:14,216
<i>Just enough to get</i>
<i>your name on the books.</i>

756
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,089
Yeah, write a $20-check,
fill out a few forms,
maybe it's yours again!

757
00:53:17,132 --> 00:53:20,092
Are you sure?
So says the statute
right here.

758
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:21,615
Let's go then!

759
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:23,225
Oh, right.

760
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:25,401
Let's go!
Yeah, okay, hey,
I'll drive.

761
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:28,579
Okay. This is great.
I knew you could
do it, Pete.

762
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,930
That's perfect.
Thank you so much.
You got this whole situation--

763
00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:35,237
Jake, how many
did you have?
I had two.

764
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:36,761
That's what they tell
every cop.

765
00:53:36,804 --> 00:53:37,849
Two and a half.

00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:43,332
<i>Wait until I get</i>
<i>in the car!</i>

767
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:46,771
Jake, I swear to God,

I will shoot you.

00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:41,477
Why?
What are you
talking about?

772
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:43,784
You're not
getting the house.

773
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:46,221
I don't get it.
You didn't pay
taxes on it.

00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:49,268
I did!

No!

776
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:53,664
This is not right, okay?
And I'll take it to court.

777
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,318
Fine, take it to court.
It'll take months,
years even,

00:54:56,362 --> 00:54:58,669
<i>and I will fight you</i>
<i>every step of the way.</i>

779
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,323
Jake, the house is mine.
You know it already.
<i>It's not your house.</i>

780
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:03,499
<i>I pay taxes.</i>
<i>The house is mine.</i>

00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,927

I don't think
I would want to go
where you want to go.

799
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:05,648
Oh, all right.
I guess it was a bit
presumptuous of me.

800
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:09,174
I mean, why would you want
to go on a date with me?

801
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:11,829
You were
asking me out
on a date?

802
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:16,007
But I thought you
were for the men.

How do you think
I've been?

816
00:57:01,095 --> 00:57:04,795
You may be used to having
the whole world know your
business, but I'm not.

817
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:10,583
You know
I said I would sign
those papers, no problem,

818
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:13,281
but you need
to bring them down
to me yourself.

819
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:15,501
At least give me that
little bit of dignity.

Let's go.

825
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:40,308
Is it far?

826
00:57:40,352 --> 00:57:42,702
It's a few
hours at least.

827
00:57:42,745 --> 00:57:46,140
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>
<i>I need a minute.</i>

828
00:57:46,184 --> 00:57:49,361
Just one minute.

829
00:57:49,404 --> 00:57:50,753
I'll be back!

830
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:52,364

You're so good.
You're so good!

833
00:58:28,574 --> 00:58:30,576
You look comfortable.

834
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:31,882
<i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

835
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:53,077
There's nothing
to do here, right?

836
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,905
Nothing at all.

837
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,298
What is your problem
with Webster?

838
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,128
'Cause it's boring.

839
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:05,959
It's a dump.
Everything's so run down.
Shall I go on?

840
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:08,919
Okay, I'll give it to you.
Downtown Webster is
not much to look at,

841
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,487
but once we get out
into wine country,
it is...it's amazing.

842
00:59:12,531 --> 00:59:14,228
You'll love it.

843
00:59:14,272 --> 00:59:16,578
All the vines
are starting
to grow right now,

844
00:59:16,622 --> 00:59:19,755
and it's like
the whole valley
is coming alive.

845
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:22,715
Of course the summer's,
summer's the best time.

846
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:26,806
It's tourist season,
and...I can't even

And then the fall
comes along,

849
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:37,599
and all the vines
turn into the most
amazing colors of red,

yellow.

[chuckles]
Likewise.

855

Hardly.

It's a property

01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:32,410
Same thing.

867

my father died

968
01:07:50,962 --> 01:07:53,921

Sure, you can make
a personal question.

981
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:30,175
That's my soon

982
01:08:32,786 --> 01:08:35,006
What happened

983
01:08:35,049 --> 01:08:36,834

I think we have time.

985
01:08:41,142 --> 01:08:43,101
She's an actress.

01:08:43,144 --> 01:08:44,755

01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:47,148
Not Julia Roberts

988
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:50,325
She's well known
in television.

989
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:53,328
I moved down to L.A.
with her in a big house
in the Hollywood Hills.

990
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:55,374
It sounds exciting.

991
01:08:55,417 --> 01:08:56,984
More like humiliating.

992
01:08:57,028 --> 01:09:00,988
Everything
was about her
and her fame.

993
01:09:01,032 --> 01:09:02,642
Yeah.

994
01:09:02,686 --> 01:09:05,819
So, she gets this role
in a movie, finally,

995
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:09,388
and she hooks up
with her co-star.

996
01:09:09,431 --> 01:09:11,390
No!

997
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:14,045
And didn't even have
the guts to tell me
about herself.

998
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:16,177
Her assistant
has to tell me.

999
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:18,310
Then I got to see
all the pictures
in the tabloids.

1000
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:19,703
It was awesome.

1001
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:23,402
Wow.
That's why
you're angry.

1002
01:09:23,445 --> 01:09:25,578
You should.
I would be angry, too.

1003
01:09:25,622 --> 01:09:28,581
I'm not angry.
I'm just embarrassed.

1004
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,496
It's not--

1005
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,239
That wasn't me.
I didn't belong there.

1006
01:09:34,282 --> 01:09:35,849
What about you?

1007
01:09:35,893 --> 01:09:40,071
Do you...have
a boyfriend
or a husband?

1008
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:44,510
I have a fiancé.

1009
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,860
Yeah.

1010
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:49,341
Or maybe he's just
a boyfriend.

1011
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:52,474
Or-or maybe
he's nothing.

1012
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:56,653
I-I don't know where
we stand anymore,
you know.

1013
01:09:56,696 --> 01:09:58,959
He's like a child.

1014
01:09:59,003 --> 01:10:00,787
He only thinks
of himself.

1015
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:03,921
It's pretty much
like your, your--

1016
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:07,185
Yeah, we should get
the two of them together.

1017
01:10:07,228 --> 01:10:08,490
[hiccups]

1018
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:09,796
Sorry.
Oh!

1019
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,624
[both laugh]
I'm sorry.

1020
01:10:11,668 --> 01:10:13,887

[laughing]
I'm so sorry.

1022
01:10:15,759 --> 01:10:18,239
Happens

you want.
