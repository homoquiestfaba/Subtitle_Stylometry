00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,319
Oh, boy!

2
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,185
My first party ever...

3
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,417
and it's the best party

4
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,753
in the world!

5
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,793
[Scoffs]
This jackfest?

6
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,849
But this is

7
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,418
the "peace feast,"
celebrating

8
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,485
the end of hostilities

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,997
between Titan and Mars!

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,055
It's the most important

11
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,623
social event of...

12
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,032
step aside,
talking brochure.

13
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,035
Just looking for

14
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,036
a cocktail waitress.

15
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,094
And by cock
I mean mine,

16
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,073
and by "tail"
I mean hers.

17
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,733
Would you like a mojito?

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,742
Great.

19
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,869
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa!

20
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,344
I didn't say leave.

21
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,744
That Gibbs fellow

22
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,907
gives me the hives.

23
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:23,914
What is he planning?

24
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:24,915
Yes, well at least

25
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:25,916
he has a plan,

26
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,917
which is more
than I can say

27
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,580
for Titan Force Five.

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,588
Don't worry!

29
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:31,954
Let's just say
a little bird

30
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,652
told me that
Titan Force Five

31
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,489
has everything
under control!

32
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,494
Wink.

33
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,495
Winking.

34
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,496
Wink.

35
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,497
And for you.

36
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,658
Oh, look,
that little boy

37
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,132
from the
make-a-wish foundation

38
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,669
thinks he's one of us!

39
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,966
How cute!

40
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,529
So I told the duchess,

41
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,370
"forget the soup spoon.

42
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,875
You could use
a good forking."

43
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,876
[Laughter]

44
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,310
Your boy's
quite a celebrity,

45
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,311
Hammerschmiddtt.

46
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,540
He flies
combat fighters like

47
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,946
Chuck Yeager
with bees

48
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,608
on his balls...
and having

49
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,617
the Hammerschmiddtt
good looks

50
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,618
doesn't hurt him any.

51
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,676
Good looks must skip

52
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:02,686
a generation.

53
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,983
You should meet him,
now that

54
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,115
he's not
blowing up your

55
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,283
warships for a living.

56
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,291
Troy!

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,292
Meet Admiral Bitchface.

58
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,293
Sir.

59
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,294
The heir to Hammerschmiddtt

60
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,625
motors!
I'm honored.

61
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,630
Oh, no.

62
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,631
My son is a
crack pilot,

63
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,632
but he has the
business acumen

64
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,633
of a squirrel.

65
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:16,691
That's why
my daughter

66
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,430
Tiffany
will be taking over.

67
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,437
Enjoy sitting at a desk

68
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,438
the rest of your life, sis!

69
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,439
I'll be too busy

70
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,440
french kissing...

71
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,441
adventure itself!

72
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,442
Good thing
you've gotten

73
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,274
plenty of practice...

74
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,870
french kissing your dad's

75
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,471
butthole.

76
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,573
Sasha Caylo.

77
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,311
Troy Hamburgerschmiddtt.

78
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,317
Still flying
around in that

79
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,648
tap dancing
rust bucket?

80
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,120
Still using
dandruff shampoo

81
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,486
on your scrote?

82
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,115
If you'll excuse me.

83
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,092
This is my song.

84
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,427

85
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,897
[gasp!]

86
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,365
Oh, yeah...
it's my song too!

87
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,366
Ooh! Ooh!

88
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,367
This is the way

89
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,528
you work a room, Sasha!

90
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,571
Go Sasha!

91
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,231
Your eyes
are on my ass!

92
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,002
Your eyes
are on my face!

93
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,007
Ooh ooh!

94
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,008
WOMAN:
I don't approve

95
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,009
of that.

96
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,568
Oh my God!

97
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,444
Is Titan Force Five
really here?

98
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,073
Well, a little bird told...

99
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,208
make your bird say where

100
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,082
Palmer is!

101
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,085
Haha, ladies.

102
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,086
You know, this doesn't

103
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,087
come naturally.

104
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,088
It takes thousands

105
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,089
of butterfly presses

106
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,250
for pec
control like this!

107
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,258
Who's next?

108
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,988
[Squealing]

109
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,324
Move!!

110
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,557

spotlight while you

111
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,895
can,
Hummersplirt.

112
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,059
When I catch Gibbs,

113
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,932
you'll be
yesterday's fishwrap.

114
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:24,992
Catch him?

115
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,504
He's kicking
your ass so bad,

116
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,835
the only way
you'll catch him

117
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,135
is if he literally gets

118
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,733
his foot caught
in your rectum.

119
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,777
Is that your nose hair

120
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,074
or have you been
snorting pubes?

121
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,980
Oh!

122
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,381
And let me tell you, VD

on a submarine...

124

125
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,020
Um, no thanks...

126
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,021
Oh!

127
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,148
Perhaps you'd like a...

128
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,192
whore d'oeuvre?

129
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,317
Uh,
what the hell did you

130
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,553
just say to
my daughter?

131
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,560
Your daughter?

132
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,561
Well, I think
its safe to say

133
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,222
Sasha belongs
to the people.

134
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,230
At least the fun parts.

135
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,231
Uh, we've got a faulty

136
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,232

137
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,233

What the hell
do you want?

141
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,538
I'm here to salute you,

A-bam!!

144
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,937
You can't
beat four aces.

145
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,443
Dammit, Gibbs...!

146
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,443
Lookin' good, Jojo!

147
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,444
You got any fries

148
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,445
to go with
that shake?

149
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,446
What shake?

150
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,709
This one.

151
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,250
[Rumbling, crowd screams]

152
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,886
Aw, certain
doom sure does

153
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,894
suck, doesn't it?

154
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,895
It does!

155
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,192
It does suck!

156
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,494
You have one
chance to avoid

157
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,499
agonizing death and

158
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,500
dismemberment,

159
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,934
but you'll
have to listen to

160
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,234
every word...

161
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,240
looks like it's
Gibbs zero,

162
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,334
Titan Force... Five.

163
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,403
Congratulations,
dip shit.

164
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,108
He's killed us all.

165
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,542
We've been
torn away from

00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,812
the docking structure!

167

There's no escape!

168
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,053
So let me
get this straight,

169
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,054
you all
choose death?

170
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,055
Weird.

171
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,421
Just tell us
what you want.

172
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,424
Okay.

173
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,551
You remember
as a kid,

174
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,151
Christmas morning,
how you'd get

175
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,129
some
super-awesome toy?

176
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,664
You'd be dying to play with it

177
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,063
but Santa
forgot to give you

178
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,123
double-A batteries?

179
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,133
Oh,
I hated that!

180
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,134
Well,
that is how I feel

181
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,135
right now!

182
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,136
Because
I've got a new toy,

183
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,866
and it is
the coolest!

184
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,373
I've just stolen a cubic ton

185
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,205
of hyper-atomic
martian fuel!

186
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,369
That's a
Hammerschmiddtt

187

product, Gibbs.

188
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,478
The fuel's
inactive without

189
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,479
a molecular trigger-code.

190
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,480

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,981
So here's my proposal...

193
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:19,984
and there's

194
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,645
my counterproposal.

195
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,653
Zing!

196
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,780
My proposal is...

197
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,788
denied.

198
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,789
My propos...

199
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,790
foot got your tongue?

200
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,791
It's a play
on words.

201
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,792
Dammit, Palmer!

202
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,793
Give me
the codes or die!

203
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,794
Jeez!

204
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,795
Here's a toast...

205
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,831
to your face!

206
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,196
Mars
doesn't negotiate

207
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,199
with terrorists!

208
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,200
Oh, okay.

209
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,463
Well, I guess
I lose, then.

210
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,469
Oh, wait!

211
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,470
You've all
got about, oh,

212
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,471
five minutes

213
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,472
before you're
sucking down

214
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,473
a lava slurpee.

215
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,474
Oh, my goodness!

216
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,443
Codes or death, people.

217
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,877
My God, man,
where do you

218
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,642
store your nukes,
in a pagoda

219
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,944
guarded by
stuffed animals?

220
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,949
Oh, are we sharing

221
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,007
a blame pizza?

222
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,018
There's enough
slices for

223
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,213
everyone,
considering Gibbs

224
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,550
<i>is your rogue agent!</i>

225
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,884
Gentlemen,
gentlemen...

226
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,447
fine, fine, just relax,

227
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,457
I've got the
codes right here.

228
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,925
Prime Minister, no!

229
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,461
We're Martians, sir!

230
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,723
We'll die before
we bend over

231
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,264
for some terrorist
rump-pumping!

232
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,264
Troy and his
boyfriend make

233
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,391
a good point, but you're

234
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,368
forgetting one thing...

235
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,768
Titan Force Five
kicks ass!

236
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,136
[Cheering]

237
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,799
Oh no.

238
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,779
This one's
personal, team!

239
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:23,941
I am the sworn enemy

240
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,948
of all crabs!

241
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:25,949
Here, here!

242
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,950
You two are...

243
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:27,951
ridiculous.

244
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,952
Wait!

245
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,953
I can't get a lock!

246
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,013
This thing
has no crotch!

247
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,023
Repeat!

248
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,026
This thing
has no crotch!!!

249
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,026
Abort mission!

250
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,859
Abort mission!

251
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,863
Hope your balls like

252
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:40,864
the taste of lava.

253
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:41,900
Say,
are you sure we don't

254
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,957
deal with terrorists?

255
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,002
It's in our constitution.

256
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,002
In some
obscure subsection,

257
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,003
or...?

258
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,004
In the first paragraph.

259
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,131
Well, fuck.

260
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,174
Why don't
they just form

261
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,573
Titan Maximum?

262
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,803
Because, kids, they're led

263
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,903
by an egomaniacal
troglodyte

264
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,379
who will let you all die

265
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,779
in a fiery hell
before he shares

266
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,612
even one iota of glory.

267
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,810
Titan Force Five
is a team,

268
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,818
Gibbs.

269
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,081
And they'll beat
you as a team.

270
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,452
Make way for

271
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,854
the awesome train!

272
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,016
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-

273
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,024
awesooommmme!

274
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,025
Palmer!

275
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,120
WILLIE: His armor is
too strong! [Straining]

276
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,630
Palmer!

277
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,630
Dammit, people!

278
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,723
Start acting
like a team!

279
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,029
As a team, I think

280
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,034
that we
should form...

281
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,434
my idea first!

282
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,630
Ooh!
They're forming

283
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,502
Titan Maximum!

284
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,337
It's breathtaking!

285
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,637
I guess we'll
all just take

286
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,337
your word for it, then.

287
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,582
[Over loudspeaker]

288
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,551
Attention crab!

289
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,486
Put down the
convention center!

290
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,351
Oh, you son of a bitch!

291
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,553
You're about
to get punched

292
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,061
the fuck out!

293
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,330
I... l'm blind!

294
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,096
My God,
it took my eyes!

295
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,101
It overloaded our visual

296
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,102
systems!

297
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,103
I'm recalibrating
the main...

298
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,104
"Eh-beh-beh-beh!"

299
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,105
God, I wish the
crab had taken

300
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,334
my ears.

301
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,934
Oh, my goodness!

302
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:00,944
We're doomed!

303
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,105
Woulda been
nice to see.

304
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,614
Okay, let's
re-evaluate here.

305
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,615
You're out of heroes,

306
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,616
out of time,

307
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,617
and generally boned.

308
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,618
So, who votes

309
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,314
for giving
me the codes?

310
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,320
Sorry, old boy.

311
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,321
Not happening.

312
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,322
Some things are worth

313
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,323
dying for.

314
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,324
I'll take that gallon of

315
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,861
molten magma
up my anus!

316
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,022
Now! Please.

317
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,497
You have your answer,
Gibbs.

318
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,794
And I hope you heard it

319
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,029
loud and clear.

320
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,367
Gibbs?

321
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,736
Prime Minister!

322
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,899
Five... ten...

323
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,907
and then a slash.

324
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,908
It might be
a backslash.

325
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,909
If one
doesn't work,

326
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:32,910
try the other.

327
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,911
Prime Minister, no!

328
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,912
What?
We voted!

329
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:35,913
Show of hands.

330
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:36,914
It was this
or the volcano,

331
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:37,915
you fool!

332
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,916
Eew, yeah.
About that.

333
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,009
It's actually
gonna be this

334
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,747
<i>and the volcano,
I'm afraid.</i>

335
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,879
So...

336
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:43,887
double-cross!

337
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,890
Enjoy!

338
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,460
WILLIE:
Systems back online!

339
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,725
It was a
one-in-a-million

340
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,730
chance,
but I managed to...

341
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,731
can we just
wrap this up?

342
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,358
We're talking
buttcrack sweat at

343
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,494
rainforest magnitude,
people!

344
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,833
Push!

345
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,838
Push as if
saving the day

346
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,896
and rubbing it in Troy

347
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:02,906
Hammerschmiddtt's
ugly-ass face

348
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,907
and lording
it over him for

349
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,068
the rest of his
worthless life

350
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,408
depended on it!

351
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,971
Titan Maximum
just might...

352
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,043
PALMER:
Push!

353
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,451
Puush!!

354
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:26,864
Brilliant, Troy!

355
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,865
Hey, it's what

356
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,265
Hammerschmiddtts do.

357
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,267
Push!

358
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,268
Uhh...

359
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,305
nothing's
pushing back.

360
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,306
Did we do that?

361
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,773
Noooooooooooooooooo!!!

362
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,639
[Chanting]
Troy! Troy! Troy!

363
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,474
Me! Me! Me! Me!

364
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,013
Alright,
team effort, right?

365
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,013
Let Mars get
in on the act,

366
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,014
y'know, spirit

367
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,107
of the peace
feast and all.

368
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,173
Dumb bastard.

369
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,184
After you
belly-flopped

370
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,345
into the volcano
like a drunk

371
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,752
frat boy,
the Prime Minister

372
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,880
gave up the codes.

373
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,946
Thank God the
Hammerschmiddtt

374
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:52,991
kid stepped up.

375
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,048
Time for a career change,

376
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,058
Caylo!

377
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,059
Fighting evil...

378
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,060
not so much your thing!

379
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,061
<i>But we won!</i>

380
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,392
Not him!

381
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,023
Us! Me!

382
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,431
Virtue is its own reward,

383
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,696
Sasha.

384
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,135
Ow!

385
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,297
Ooh, ooh, excuse me.

386
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,136
A little bird tol' me that

387
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,335
you are
Titan Maximum.

388
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,741
Oh, did he?

389
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,780
Well that little
bird told me...

390
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,678
you're so hot...

391
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,943
and sexy.

392
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,783
Ooh, and you're
a good kisser.

393
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,689
[Thud!]

394
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,123
This is the
greatest night

395
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,751
of my life!

396
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,526
Timmy!

397
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,187
Good God,

398
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,130
to my sweet,
transsexual Timmy?
