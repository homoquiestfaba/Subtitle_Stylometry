00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,580
YESTERDAY'S NEWS,
OLD HAT.

171
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,632
MAYBE TONY HAS A BEEF
WITH SOMEBODY IN NEW YORK
OR LAS VEGAS.

172
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,634
LIKE WHO?

173
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,594
YOU GOT NOTHING,
GENTLEMEN.

174
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,722
YOU'RE GRASPING AT STRAWS.

175
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,100
EXCUSE ME, KEENAN,
WEREN'T YOU THE ONE THAT WANTED
O.C. SHOW-AND-TELL DAY?

176
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,811
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHY A DETECTIVE
WITH VALENTINE'S HISTORY

177
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,063
WAS TAKEN OFF A DESK
FOR SOMETHING THIS BIG.

178
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,066
ALL DUE RESPECT,
IT'S WHERE HE BELONGS.

179
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,068
JACK'S THE ONE
KNOWS THESE GUYS.

180
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,987
HE'S GOT ALL
THE RELATIONSHIPS.

181
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,322
YEAH, PLUS
HE'S A GOOD COP.

182
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,283
WELL, HE USED TO BE,
SURE,

183
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,285
BUT I NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S
HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS.

184
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,746
IF JACK MAY SPEAK
FOR HIMSELF FOR A MINUTE,

185
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,459
KEENAN,
THAT'S ALL HISTORY.

186
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,754
IT TOOK YOU
SIX GODDAMN MONTHS
TO SET UP TONY D.

187
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,964
- YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO WEEKS.
- FOR WHAT?

188
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,800
TO GET ME SOMETHING
TO ROLL THESE GUYS UP.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,011
YOU KNOW,
YOU GLIDE UP IN HERE
THREATENING PEOPLE.

190
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,680
YOU THREATEN FRANK.
AND NOW YOU START
THREATENING ME.

191
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,349
JACK.

192
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,941
I'M COOL, MAN.

193
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,861
TWO WEEKS, THAT'S IT.

194
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,738
WHAT DO YOU SAY, JACK?

195
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,992
- I SAY WE FIND THE LEAK.
<i>WHERE DO YOU START?</i>

196
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,954
TONY D'S GIRL IS
AS GOOD A PLACE AS NAY.

197
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,956
THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

198
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,877
WELL, RIGHT NOW, KEENAN,
THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

199
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,464
OKAY.

200
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,008
BUT DON'T COME BEGGING
FOR YOUR JOB BACK

201
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,093
WHEN IT DOESN'T
WORK OUT.

202
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,808
GENTLEMEN, COUNSELOR.

203
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,024
DETECTIVE VALENTINE,
COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?

204
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,653
THANK YOU,
DETECTIVE KELLY.

205
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,709
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
WAS FUN.

206
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,003
WHAT IF KEENAN COMES BACK
FOR HIS BOW TIE?

207
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,464
I DON'T CARE ABOUT KEENAN.
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

208
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,050
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE LOST
A LOT OF WEIGHT.

209
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,719
WELL, THE NICE THING ABOUT
A LITTLE ANXIETY

210
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,763
IS YOU LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT
HAVING TO DO ON A DIET.

211
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,267
AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT
GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP EITHER.

212
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,602
ARE YOU STILL HAVING
THOSE DREAMS?

213
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,146
- YOU MEAN THE NIGHTMARES?
- MM-HMM.

214
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,148
A TRIPLE FEATURE
EVERY NIGHT.

215
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,276
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
LET ME COOK YOU DINNER

216
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,987
LATER ON IN THE WEEK.

217
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,406
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
DOING THAT ANYMORE.

218
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,992
JACK, IT'S JUST DINNER,

219
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,994
NOT YOUR HAND
IN MARRIAGE.

220
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,370
THINK ABOUT IT.

221
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,547
OH, HI, SUGAR PIE.
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK DOWN HERE?

222
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,801
WELL, I MISSED YOU.
AND I WANTED TO GET
A LITTLE INFORMATION.

223
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,596
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

224
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,598
- A WOMAN NAMED ALMA ANSON.
- OKAY.

225
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,601
NOW SHE'S A WITNESS
IN THE TONY DENISIO
MURDER CASE.

226
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,603
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW?

227
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,688
ANY LITTLE TIDBIT
YOU CAN GET ME.

228
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,151

<i>THE LIGHTS OUT ♪</i>

229

<i>IN THE SHADOW... ♪</i>

230
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,572
WE'RE FINE.

231
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,574
- HEY, HO, HO.
- HEY, JACK.

232
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,828
- YOU LOOK GREAT, MAN.
- HOLY SHIT. WELL...

233
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,873
- HEY, A DRINK, COME ON.
- NO, NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.
NO, NO, I--

234
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,499
- HEY, TOMMY, TOMMY.
- WHAT?

235
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,418
LET ME TALK TO YOU A SECOND.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

236
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,045
ABOUT WHAT?

237
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,172
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT TONY.

238
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,216
OH, FUCK, IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S NUTS, MAN.

239
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,218
NO, NO, NO, NO,
TOMMY, TOMMY,

240
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,180
NOW HOW'S YOUR
BROTHER DOING?

241
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,182
GREAT.
VINCENT'S DOING GREAT.

242
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,559
THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT SEEMS MAYBE YOU FORGOT

243
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,395
- I HELPED HIM OUT
WITH HIS EARLY PAROLE.
- HEY, I AIN'T FORGOT.

244
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,814
YOU WERE GREAT, DETECTIVE.
YOU WERE A BIG HELP, OKAY?

245
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,317
OKAY, THEN HELP ME OUT.
TOMMY, GIVE ME SOMETHING.

246
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,028
I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN
THIS KIND OF SHIT BEFORE.
TELL ME ABOUT TONY.

247
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,782
YEAH, I THINK IT'S
ONE OF THOSE THINGS,
YOU KNOW--

248
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,992
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
FIND OUT WHO DID
ALL OF THIS.

249
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,703
LIKE MAYBE 20 YEARS
FROM NOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THAT--

250
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,539
TOMMY, TOMMY,
I AIN'T GOT 20 YEARS.
TELL ME SOMETHING.

251
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,042
WHAT ABOUT THAT TALL,
SKINNY BLOND GIRL
HE WAS SEEING?

252
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,795
I'M BEING
HONEST HERE, JACK.
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

253
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,421
I GOTTA GO.

254
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,675
- TOMMY.
- CALL ME, CALL ME.

MICHAEL NOCERA A VISIT.

258
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,658
YEAH, TONY D'S
NUMBER-ONE GUYS.

259
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,869
<i>HE SEEM HAPPY ABOUT IT</i>
<i>TO YOU?</i>

260
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,580
IT'S A FUNERAL, JACK.
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO
LOOK HAPPY.

261
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,208
NO, MAN, THAT'S BULLSHIT.
THEY'RE LEANING ON HIM, MAN.

262
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,422
THREE-TO-TWO IT'S 'CAUSE
NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE

263
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,424
WHO KILLED TONY D.

264
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,301
WHAT, YOU THINK NOCERA?
HE'S NOT THAT STUPID.

265
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,058
Jack:
<i>HEY, MAN, HOLD ON NOW.</i>

266
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>HEY, LOOK WHO</i>
<i>SHOWED UP.</i>

00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,943
HEY, WHATEVER YOU'RE

273
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,405
PHIL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE.
I'M JUST GONNA RATTLE
THE CAGE A LITTLE BIT.

274
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,949

275
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,910

276
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,004
SON OF A BITCH.

277
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,174
OH, SORRY,
I'M A LITTLE LATE.

278
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,344
A GUY IS DEAD.
NOW THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT.

279
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,138
YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER.

280
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,182
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
JOEY, JOEY, TECHNICALLY

281
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,809
I HAD A RELATIONSHIP
WITH TONY TOO.

<i>I CAN'T PAY</i>
<i>MY LAST RESPECTS?</i>

283

00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,898
<i>JUST LEAVE US</i>
<i>THE FUCK ALONE.</i>

285
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,777
ALL RIGHT.

286
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,321
I CAN SEE WHEN
I'M NOT WANTED.

287
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,824
OKAY.
MICHAEL, FELLOWS.

288
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,885
( sighs )

289
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,346
THE GUY GIVES ME
A LARGE PAIN.

290
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,474
YOU KNOW THAT MAN?

291
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,727
A LONG TIME AGO,

292
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,729
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

293
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,189
IS THAT ALL?

294
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,191
HE USED TO BE AROUND
ALL THE TIME,

295
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,027
ALWAYS POKING
HIS NOSE IN.

296
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,613
YEAH.

297
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,449
HOW GOOD DO YOU KNOW HIM?

298
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,162
JUST ANOTHER HUMP
WITH A BADGE, JOE.

299
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,593
YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THERE,
ANYONE YOU RECOGNIZE?

300
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,053
HUH-UH, SORRY.
IT ALL HAPPENED
TOO QUICKLY.

301
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,806
( through speaker )
I didn't get a good look.

302
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,474
Okay.

303
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,476
WHAT SCHOOL
DID YOU GO TO?

304
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,854
ST. MARY'S, BOSTON,
TILL THEY KICKED ME OUT

305
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,731
FOR TALKING BACK
TO THE NUNS.

306
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,067
MM. FAMILY?

307
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,952
DOES IT UPSET YOU IF I ASK
YOU ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

308
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,997
YOU CAN'T UPSET ME,
DETECTIVE.

309
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,750
GOOD.

310
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,085
IF YOU MUST KNOW, MY MOTHER
DIED WHEN I WAS FIVE.

311
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,962
MY FATHER DIED
WHEN I WAS EIGHT.

312
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,009
How long have you
known Tony D?

313
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,845
- ONE MONTH.
- WHERE DID YOU MEET?

314
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,348
WHERE THE GIRLS
MEET THE BOYS--
AT SOME PARTY.

315
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,602
DID IT MAYBE BOTHER YOU
WHO HE WAS?

316
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:33,273
DID IT MAYBE BOTHER YOU
THAT THAT WITNESS
GOT KILLED--

317
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,610
THAT LADY YOU WERE
SUPPOSE TO PROTECT?

318
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:44,910
DOES IT UPSET YOU
WHEN I ASK YOU ABOUT
YOUR PAST, DETECTIVE?

319
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,414
WHY DON'T WE JUST STAY
FOCUSED ON YOU?

320
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,999
YOU'RE UPSET,

321
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,877
but you can't show it.

322
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,589
JUST ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS.

323
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,968
WHY DID TONY D COME
TO YOUR HOUSE THAT NIGHT?

324
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,803
WHY DID YOUR WIFE
LEAVE YOU?

325
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,805
COUNSEL, YOU WANT
TO TELL YOUR CLIENT
TO QUIT PLAYING GAMES

326
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,807
AND ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS?

327
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,519
( whispers )

328
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,940
MEN LIKE TONY DON'T TALK
TO WOMEN LIKE ME
ABOUT BUSINESS.

329
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,859
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK
TONY'S BUSINESS WAS?

330
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,112
DO I LOOK STUPID
TO YOU, DETECTIVE?

331
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,114
I KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT TONY WAS.

332
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,533
HE WAS GOOD TO ME
AND TIMES ARE TOUGH.

333

I'M THROUGH WITH YOU FOR NOW.

336

339
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,954

340
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,582

OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

342
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,795
- HI.
- HI.

343
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,591
LET ME DO THIS
FOR YOU.

344
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,385
GO AHEAD.
WAS THERE TRAFFIC?

345
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,012
NO, IT WAS COOL.

346
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,097
GET YOUR JACKET?

347
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,522
( sighs )

348
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,691
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME WINE?

349
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,818
NO, SHIT.

350
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,909
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT A MAN IN THE KITCHEN

351
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,495
THAT REALLY
TURNS ME ON.

352
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,039
REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID?

353
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,416
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER.

354
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,968
JACK.

355
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,305

HEY.

357
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,867
JACK?

358
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,087
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BETTER
QUIT BLAMING YOURSELF.

359
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,340
OKAY, SO YOU GOT TOO CLOSE
TO A WITNESS-- NOT SMART.

360
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,926
BUT YOU DIDN'T PULL
THE TRIGGER.

361
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,304
ARE YOU GONNA SEND ME
A BILL FOR ALL THIS
FREE ANALYSIS?

362
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,600
NO, SHE KNEW IT WAS
DANGEROUS TO WEAR A WIRE.

363
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,227
SHE WANTED TO DO IT.

364
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,820
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER
IF WHEN YOU CAME HERE

365
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,531
YOU WERE READY
TO BE HERE.

366

OH, YOU DON'T NEED

THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL

389
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,833
WELL, I BELIEVE I'VE ANSWERED
ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ALREADY.

390
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,210
I HAVE ONE MORE.

391
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,132
OKAY, WELL, I'VE GOT
ONE QUESTION FOR YOU TOO.

392
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,054

393
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,891

394
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,893
PROTECTION.

395
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,313
I ALWAYS LIKE
TO BE PROTECTED.

396
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,274

397
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:35,737
WHY WOULD WHOEVER KILLED
TONY D LEAVE YOU ALIVE?

398
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,365
SO YOU THINK
I'M IN DANGER?

399
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,120
WELL, I THINK
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

400
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,122
THAT THEY'RE GONNA COME
PAY YOU A VISIT, YEAH.

401
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,376
WELL, I'M NOT
THAT WORRIED.

402
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,544
<i>WELL, I JUST THOUGHT</i>
<i>YOU MIGHT THINK</i>

403
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,922
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
TO HAVE A FRIEND
THAT WAS A COP.

404
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,758
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN
BY "FRIEND"?

405
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,011
FRIEND-- I TALK, YOU TALK,
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

406
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,055
WELL, FRIENDSHIP IS
SOMETHING YOU FEEL.

407
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,057
<i>IT'S SOMETHING</i>
<i>IN YOUR SOUL.</i>

408
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,518
IT'S NOT AN EXCHANGE

409
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,062
ARE YOU STILL WATCHING ME,
DETECTIVE?

410
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,565
I THINK YOU HAVE
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE

411
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,235
INTERESTING IN MIND
THAN JUST FRIENDS.

412
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:19,447
YOU KNOW, THIS--
THIS MIGHT COME
AS A TOTAL SURPRISE,

413
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,826
BUT I DON'T FIND
YOUR TALL, LANKY ASS
IRRESISTIBLE AT ALL.

414
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,955
LOOK, BOYS AND GIRLS
IS THE SUBJECT I'M NEVER
WRONG ABOUT.

415
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,957
<i>ME,</i>
DO YOU?

416
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,959
NO, I DON'T KNOW YOU
PERSONALLY,

417
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,671
BUT THE WORLD'S FULL OF MEN
THAT WANT TO BE MY FRIEND.

418
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,132
ALL RIGHT.

419
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,426

AND YOU DECIDE

423
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,934
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

424
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,936
OH, ONE MORE THING:

425
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,605
UH, HOW DID YOU KNOW

426
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,607
THAT PERSONAL STUFF
ABOUT ME?

427
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,610
YOU, YOUR WITNESS,
YOUR BREAKDOWN--

428
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,697
COME ON, JACK,
IT WAS ALL IN THE PAPERS.

429
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,118
OKAY.

430
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,579
WAIT, I DIDN'T GET
TO ASK YOU MY QUESTION.

431
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,000
DID IT BOTHER YOU
THAT TONY DIED?

432
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,003
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE
DIE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

433
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,005
WELL, THAT'S NOT
AN ANSWER.

434
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,966
ARE YOU HAPPY
THAT THEY SHOT HIM?

435
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,886
I THINK YOUR BOYFRIEND WAS
A LOW-ON-THE-FOOD-CHAIN
PIECE OF SHIT

436
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,888
AND THE WORLD IS PROBABLY
BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM.

437
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,306
HMM.

YEAH?

504
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,242
YEAH, I DO A VERY
GOOD JOB.

505
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,244
- YEAH.
- YEAH, YOUR INVITATION.

506
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,621
OH.

507
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,623
HERE, IT'S MY V.I.P. CARD,

508
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,209
MASTER SHIELD.
I NEVER LEAVE HOME
WITHOUT IT.

509
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,464
<i>( music continues</i>
<i>in distance )</i>

510
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,720
MM, GOD, I MISSED YOU.

511
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,575
WAIT.

512
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,203
OH, YOU GOT TIME
TO TALK TO ME?

513
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,498
- LOOK, I WANT TO EXPLAIN.
- NO, NO, THERE'S NOTHING
YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

514
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,501
- I KNOW YOUNG LOVE
WHEN I SEE IT.
- NO, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

515
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,378
WHAT?
WHAT DON'T I UNDERSTAND?

516
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,506
I WORK OUT EVERY DAY.
I LOVE MY WIFE.
I LOVE MY FAMILY.

517
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,299
MICHAEL, LOOK,
YOU ARE IN GREAT SHAPE

518
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,301
AND YOU JUST GOT AN UNUSUAL
WAY OF SHOWING YOUR LOVE.

519
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,929
NO, NO, LOOK, LOOK,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S LIKE, ALL RIGHT?

520
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,764
THE WOMAN IS OBSESSED
WITH ME.

521
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,766
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD,
BECAUSE YOU JUST BECAME

522
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,435
MY NUMBER-ONE SUSPECT
IN THE TONY D MURDER.

523
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,189
I THINK MAYBE
YOU TOOK A WRONG IDEA.

524
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,817
ALMA IS TONY'S GIRL.
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

525
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,778
MICHAEL, YOU NEED TO TAKE
YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

526
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,781
- SHE GOT YOU ACTING
KIND OF CRAZY, MAN.
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

527
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,159
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
- WELL, I'VE SEEN YOU
LOOKING AT HER TOO.

528
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,246
HERE'S THE DEAL:
YOU TURN STATE'S WITNESS,
I'LL GET YOU SOMEWHERE SAFE.

529
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,497
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

530
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,124
FUCK YOU.

531
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,126
NO, FUCK YOU.
SEE, YOU FUCKED YOURSELF.

532
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,754
YOU'D BETTER HOPE
YOU CALL ME BEFORE YOUR
UNCLE JOEY CALLS YOU.

533
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,507
YOU PAWN.
YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

534
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,635
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

535
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,637
BACK UP, BACK UP.
FIVE-OH.

536
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,390
- CARRY ON.
- THANK YOU.
GIVE ME A LITTLE SPACE.

537
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,684
<i>( car horns honking )</i>
<i>( people shouting )</i>

538
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,951
SO SHE WAS BANGING
NOCERA AND TONY D
AT THE SAME TIME?

539
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,995
I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE WAS SEEING THEM
BOTH, MAN.

540
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,164
THIS CASE IS STARTING
TO COME TOGETHER,
PARTNER.

541
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,083
YOU KNOW THOSE WEIRD
CAT STATUES SHE HAS
IN HER APARTMENT?

542
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,378
THEY'RE LIKE
CHINESE WISH DOLLS,
LIKE BIRTHDAY CANDLES,

543
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,631
LIKE WHEN YOUR
WISH COMES TRUE,
YOU PAINT THE EYE IN.

544
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,633
- SO?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SO?

545
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,177
SO HOW MANY
STATUES SHE GOT?
THREE.

546
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,721
HOW MANY HAVE THE EYES
PAINTED IN?

547
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,389
NEVER REALLY LOOKED.

548
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,016
ONE.
ONE.

549
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,102
WHAT IF THAT ONE EYE
WAS FOR TONY D?

550
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,314
I DON'T KNOW, PARTNER.
I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF
STRETCHING IT NOW.

551
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,524
NO, NO,
NO STRETCHING, PHIL.
THIS IS COMING TOGETHER.

552
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,610
NO STRETCHING, PHIL.

553
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,031
HEY, JOE, JOE,

554
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,033
- YOU WANT TO CROSS
THE STREET?
- HUH?

555
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,744
OH, KNOCK IT OFF.
YOU NEED A LITTLE
HELP HERE? COME ON.

556
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,704
- HELP I DON'T NEED.
- OH, YES, YOU DO.

557
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,290
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE STILL
RUNNING THE SHOW, JOE,

558
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,918
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE
MICHAEL NOCERA.

559
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,920
NOW THAT'S AN AMBITIOUS
YOUNG GUY, MAN.

560
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,547
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, HE WIPED OUT

561
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,384
YOUR FRIEND TONY D
RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSE.

562
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,971
JOE, THERE'S NO LOVE LOST
BETWEEN MICHAEL NOCERA
AND TONY D.

563
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,515
NOW MAYBE TONY WAS GONNA
FLIP STATE'S EVIDENCE,
MAYBE NOT.

564
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,309
MAYBE THAT JUST GAVE
MICHAEL THE EXCUSE
HE NEEDED, HUH?

565
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,186
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

566
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,480
I'M TALKING
ABOUT TONY'S GIRL.
MICHAEL'S DOING HER--

567
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,525
YOU KNOW, THE TALL
ONE AT THE FUNERAL.
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.

568
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,568
YOU DON'T FIT INTO NOCERA'S
VISION OF THE FAMILY

569
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,570
ANY MORE THAN YOUR FRIEND
TONY D DID.

570
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,572
BUT THE F.B.I.--
THEY GOT TWO PLACES.

571
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,741
THEY GOT
NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA.
YOU LIKE THE SUN?

572
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,202
HEY, BOSS,
EVERYTHING OKAY?

573
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,957
GO FUCK YOUR MOTHER
IN NEW MEXICO.

574
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:19,588
JOEY, I COULD BE
YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN.

575
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:23,592
- ( phones ringing )
- ( people chattering )

576
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,429
NOW MICHAEL NOCERA
DIDN'T ACTUALLY PULL
THE TRIGGER ON TONY D,

577
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,347
BUT HE DID
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

578
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,224
AND HE DID IT WITHOUT
UNCLE JOE'S BLESSING.

579
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,226
YOU THINK YOU CAN
SQUEEZE HIM?

580
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,812
HEY, I THINK HE'D RATHER
FLIP FOR US AND GIVE UP
HIS WHOLE DAMN CREW

581
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,690
THAN FACE A SHOWDOWN
WITH JOE BUDDHA.

582
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,696
IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS
AIRTIGHT IN EIGHT DAYS,

583
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,781
GREAT.

584
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,839
TONY AND I GO BACK
A LONG TIME.

585
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,591
UNDERSTAND?

586
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,677
THE GUY HAD PROBLEMS.

587
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,971
HE WAS TURNING
STATE'S EVIDENCE, JOE.

588
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,182
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
NOBODY'S SAYING DIFFERENT.

589
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,184
ARE YOU FUCKING
LISTENING TO ME?

590
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,603
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO ORDERED THE HIT
ON TONY D.

591
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,358
THERE'S A WAY TO DEAL
WITH PROBLEMS LIKE THIS.

592
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,527
AND NOBODY DOES ANYTHING
UNLESS I SAY SO.

593
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,237
UNDERSTOOD?

594
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:31,327
UNDERSTOOD.
TONY WAS A GOOD FRIEND.

595
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:35,790
HE'S A BACKDOOR STUGOTS,
A POTENTIAL RAT,

596
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,542
A FUCKING YELLOW DOG,

597
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,754
BUT I DEAL WITH IT,
NO ONE ELSE.

598
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,759
MAYBE IT WAS CARLUCCI
FROM VEGAS, HUH?

599
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,597
YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE THINK

600
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,474
I'M READY FOR
A PARK BENCH.

601
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,102
- ( chuckles )
- NOBODY THINKS THAT, JOE.

602
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,437
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MIKEY?

603
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,773
YOU THINK YOU'RE READY
TO DRIVE THE TRUCK?

604
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,736
NOW LET ME TELL YOU,

605
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,781
IT'S A VERY FAST
FUCKING VEHICLE.

606
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,039
ANOTHER THING
THAT BOTHERS ME--

607
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,125
THAT GIRL TONY D
WAS GOING WITH

608
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,797
GIVES ME A BAD FEELING,

609
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,800
VERY BAD.

610
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,816
( tires screech )

611
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:56,036
- ( tires screech )
<i>( horn honks )</i>

612
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,275
<i>Tony.</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

613
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,737
<i>Did I ever tell you</i>
<i>about the time I was</i>
<i>in boarding school?</i>

614
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,114
<i>Nah, you didn't.</i>

615
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,617
<i>It was 102 in the shade.</i>

616
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,622
<i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

617
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,082
<i>It was so hot...</i>
- YEAH.

618
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,085
Alma:
<i>IT'S ME.</i>

619
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,087
- ALMA?
- YEAH.

620
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,381
<i>You know how</i>
<i>I dozed off?</i>
<i>How?</i>

621
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,884
<i>I was naked</i>
<i>under the sheets.</i>

622
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,178
( turns off player )

623
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,017
COME ON IN.

624
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,686
YOU WERE RIGHT.
I DO NEED A FRIEND.

625
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,234
I DON'T KNOW, JACK.
YOU SURPRISE ME.

626
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,819
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A SUBLET.

627
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,947
HAVE A SEAT.

628
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,034
A DRINK?

629
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,869
GOT A GLASS?

630
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,871
NOT A CLEAN ONE.

631
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,832
I'LL PASS.

632
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,292
( turns on player )

633
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,294
<i>And then</i>

634
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,296
<i>a little hand</i>
<i>dropped down...</i>

635
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,506
( turns off )

636
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,466
YOU'RE A HELL OF
A STORYTELLER.

637
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,177
DID YOU MAKE THAT SHIT UP
OR DID YOU LIKE READ IT
IN A BOOK OR WHAT?

638
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,221
ACTUALLY IT WASN'T
A BOARDING SCHOOL.

639
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,390
IT WAS AN ORPHANAGE.

640
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,685
NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO PLAY ME, HUH?

641
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,687
YOU ADD SOME
VIOLINS IN THERE?

642
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,648
TRYING TO PUSH
MY BUTTONS?

643
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,650
I GOT NO BUTTONS
LEFT TO PUSH.

644
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,610
WANT TO BET?

645
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,239
SEE, NOW MICHAEL AND TONY--
THEY MAY LIKE ALL THIS,

646
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,493
BUT ME-- YOU NEED TO FIND
YOURSELF ANOTHER SUCKER.

647
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,079
WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID
OF ME?

648
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,587
YOU CAME BY HERE
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

649
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,006
WHY DON'T YOU
CUT TO THE CHASE?

650
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,678
WHAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT YOU HEAR?

651
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,056
LIKE WHAT YOU TOLD
MICHAEL NOCERA TO GET HIM
TO KILL TONY D?

652
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:25,019
YOU'RE GIVING ME
TOO MUCH CREDIT, JACK.

653
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,646
THEY'RE JUST
NATURAL PREDATORS.

654
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,614
SO WHAT WOULD MICHAEL
THE NATURAL PREDATOR

655
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,033
THINK OF YOU
WITH ME RIGHT NOW?

656
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,579
<i>IT'S OVER.</i>
<i>HE'S IN THE PAST.</i>

657
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,581
WHY DON'T I
BELIEVE YOU?

658
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,459
BECAUSE YOU'RE A COP.
IT'S YOUR JOB.

659
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,295
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

660
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,549
<i>( answering machine</i>

661
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,551
<i>Hi. This is Jack.</i>
<i>Please leave a message</i>

662

Woman:
<i>Jack, I know you're there.</i>

664
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,307
<i>Pick up, come on.</i>
<i>We need to talk.</i>

665
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,060
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU
PRETTY BAD.

666
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,812
<i>Jack, pick up.</i>
- EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

667
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,814
<i>Jack, I'm not</i>
<i>gonna hang up.</i>

668
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,317
<i>Pick up.</i>
<i>Come on, we need to talk.</i>

669
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,778
<i>Jack, pick up the phone.</i>

670
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,946
YEAH.

671
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,115
NO, NO, I JUST RAN
THE PHOTO.

672
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,788
CAN I CALL YOU BACK
IN FIVE MINUTES?

673
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,582
RIGHT, YEAH,
I'LL CALL YOU

674
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,917
RIGHT.

675
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,842
ALMA?

676

Jack:
<i>THIS GIRL'S READY</i>
<i>TO TALK.</i>

677
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,113
NOW WE'VE GOT
A BREAK HERE.
LET'S ROLL WITH IT.

678
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,782
WHAT BREAK? SHE COMES
TO YOUR HOUSE. SHE SAYS
SHE WANTS TO HAVE DINNER.

679
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,368
WHAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN
SHE FINDS YOU A WITTY
CONVERSATIONALIST?

680
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,203
<i>JESUS.</i>

681
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,330
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND THIS WITNESS

682
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,207
THAT I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT, JACK?

683
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,209
NO.

684
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,922
I'M CULTIVATING
AN INFORMANT, THAT'S IT.

685
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,007
OKAY.

686
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,762
LOOK, JACK WILL BE
WEARING A WIRE.

687
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,223
I'LL BE IN THE TRUCK.
WE'LL GET EVERY WORD
ON TAPE.

688
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,975
I MEAN, IT'S WORTH
A SHOT.

689
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,602
Keenan:
<i>ALL THIS GIRLFRIEND SHIT</i>
<i>IS MARGINAL.</i>

690
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,564
TONY WAS SERVING US JOE
ON A PLATTER. HE FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT AND ICED HIM.

691
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,899
- IT'S REAL SIMPLE.
- IT WAS MICHAEL NOCERA.

692
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,901
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

693
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,237
LOOK, ALMA ANSON
IS NOT EVEN A REAL NAME.

694
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,823
<i>SHE IS DYING</i>
<i>TO GIVE ME SOMETHING</i>

695
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,284

MICHAEL NOCERA WITH.
I FEEL IT.

696
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,411
<i>LET'S JUST GET IT</i>
<i>ON TAPE.</i>

697
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,332
NOCERA WOULD
SELL OUT HIS GRANDMOTHER
TO AVOID GOING TO JAIL.

698
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,627
WE PUT A LITTLE
PRESSURE ON HIM, I THINK
HE'D GIVE US JOE BUDDHA.

699
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,464
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I THINK I LIKED
THESE GUYS BETTER

700
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,340
WHEN THEY HAD
THE CODE OF SILENCE.
( chuckles )

701
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,676
NO SHIT.

702
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,221
OKAY, I'LL GO WITH IT,

703
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,223
BUT I WANT EVERYTHING
OFFICIAL AND ON RECORD.

704
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,226
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CUTS A DEAL.

705
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:19,485
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THIS TONY FELLOW.

706
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,528
TONY CAME INTO MY LIFE

707
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,572
AT A TIME WHEN I REALLY
NEEDED SOMEBODY.

708
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,033
<i>Tony was a very</i>
<i>controlling man.</i>

709
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,160
<i>He had to know where</i>
<i>I was all the time.</i>

710
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,787
<i>So he was</i>
<i>a control freak.</i>

711
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,747
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>He was a control freak,</i>
<i>yeah.</i>

712
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,292
SO YOU STARTED AN AFFAIR
WITH A CONTROL FREAK'S
BUSINESS PARTNER.

713
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,795
WELL, IT WASN'T SMART,

714
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,548
BUT I THINK
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

715
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,675
( chuckles )
NO, LET'S LEAVE JACK
OUT OF THIS.

716
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:47,054
I'M THE LAST ONE TO PASS
JUDGMENT ON ANYBODY.

717
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,558
MM, SOUNDS LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY I NEED.

718
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,936
WHY? YOU GOT
MORE TO HIDE?

719
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:57,231
CURIOSITY KILLED
THE CAT, JACK.

720
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,107
BUT WHO KILLED TONY D?

721
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:08,283
DID YOU TELL NOCERA
THAT HE WAS GONNA TURN
STATE'S EVIDENCE?

722
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,918
DON'T BE SUCH A COP.

723
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,784
I-- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

724

00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,878
ALMA, WAKE UP.

731
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,880
IT'S ME.

732
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,965
WHAT'S WRONG?

733
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,927
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

734
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,727
LOOK, IT WAS
AN INCREDIBLE NIGHT, OKAY?

735
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,855
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT
AT THAT.

01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:23,781
YOU WAS ASKING AROUND
ABOUT ALMA, RIGHT?

840
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:27,618
SO THIS EMMA DUCKWORTH'S
HER GRANDMOTHER.

841
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,586
APPRECIATE THAT.

842
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,550
- THANK YOU, DEAR.
- YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

843
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,887
MISS DUCKWORTH,
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS LADY RIGHT HERE?

844
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,598
OH, YES.
THIS IS MARIAN.

845
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,600
YOU KNOW,
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG

846
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,102
SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL
DOLL COLLECTION

847
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,104
AND SHE COULD PLAY
WITH IT

848
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,981
FOREVER AND EVER.
AND IT WAS REALLY--

849
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,650
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME,
NOW WHAT DID YOU SAY
HER NAME WAS?

850
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,236
MARIAN HAMILTON.

851
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,741
YES, THIS IS MARIAN.

852
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,743
I WAS RIGHT THERE
IN THE CHURCH

853
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,496
THE DAY SHE WAS
CHRISTENED.

854
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:15,208
WHAT ABOUT
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE?

855
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,376
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THAT FELLOW?

856
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:19,545
HMM, YES.

857
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,547
THIS IS FRED HAMILTON--

858
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,758
MARIAN'S FATHER,
VERY INTERESTING.

859
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:27,637
HE COULD READ
A BOOK THIS THICK
IN A DAY.

860
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,263
- PROLIFIC.
- YEAH.

861
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,265
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION:

862
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:35,061
IF THIS IS HER DAD,
DID MARIAN SPENT ANY TIME
IN AN ORPHANAGE?

863
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,897
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, NO.

864
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,734
BUT SHE SPENT TWO YEARS
IN A HOSPITAL.

865
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,320
WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL?

866
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:50,159
AND SHE STILL IS
A BIT UNSTABLE.

867
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,455
POOR MARIAN,
SUCH A LOVELY GIRL.

868
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,671
( playing piano )

869
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,391
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
REACH YOU ALL DAY SO I COULD
FIND OUT WHAT THE GIRL SAID.

870
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,603
BUT THEY SAID YOU TOOK
A FOUR-HOUR LUNCH. AND NOW
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

871
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,606
THAT $150,000 WORTH
OF HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT
JUST STOPPED WORKING?

872
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,859
YEAH, WELL, THESE THINGS HAPPEN.
IT HAPPENED TO ME AND PHIL
THE OTHER DAY IN THE VAN.

873
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,737
- IT HAPPENED LAST YEAR.
- ( phone rings )

874
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,115
VALENTINE.
YEAH.

875
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,492
SHIT.

876
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,245
<i>( siren wailing )</i>

877
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:20,082
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME,
THE POLICE ARE COMBING
THE AREA.

878
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,668
<i>THEY'RE STILL WAITING</i>
<i>TO RELEASE THE IDENTITY...</i>

879
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,173
- WHERE IS HE?
- IN THE CAR.

880
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,342
WHAT HAPPENED?

881
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:33,220
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS,
ABOUT A DOZEN,
FOR STARTERS.

882
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,311
( sighs )

883
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,772
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED,
MICHAEL.

884
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,737
IT'S A GAMBLE WE TOOK
AND WE LOST.

885
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,239
WHAT?

886
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:55,743
JOE GOT TO NOCERA
BEFORE WE COULD.

887
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,290
THE BAD NEWS IS,
WITHOUT NOCERA,

888
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,001
THE ONLY GUY LEFT
ON YOUR LIST THAT CAN
CRACK THIS FAMILY OPEN

889
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,505
IS JOE BUDDHA HIMSELF.

890
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,548
THE GOOD NEWS IS--

891
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,178
RECOGNIZE THIS?

892
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,769
<i>IT'S ALMA ANSON'S SCARF,</i>
<i>JACK.</i>

893
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:30,277
I SURE AM GLAD HER SLIPPERS
BED.

894
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,678
- YOU'RE EARLY.
- ARE YOU COMPLAINING?

895
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,097
- NOPE.
- ALL RIGHT.

896
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:01,350
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

897
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,437
- STAY WARM.
- ALL RIGHT, PARTNER.

898
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,273
<i>( door opens</i>
<i>and closes )</i>

899
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,567
<i>( receding footsteps )</i>

900
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,701
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

901
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,245
<i>( gun clicks )</i>

902
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,961
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

903
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,130
WE NEED TO TALK,
MARIAN.

904
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,299
DON'T EVER
CALL ME THAT.

905
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,178
WELL, OF THESE NICE CATS,
YOU SEE, THE SHORT ONE
MUST BE FOR TONY D.

906
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,222
THAT WOULD MAKE THIS ONE
FOR MICHAEL NOCERA.

907
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,142
YOU REALLY DID A JOB
ON THOSE GUYS, HUH?

908
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,144
I DIDN'T NEED TO.

909
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,230
THEY LIVE IN A CRUEL WORLD.
THEY DID IT TO THEMSELVES.

910
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,900
SO YOU KEEP TELLING ME.

911
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,571
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

912
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,743
LOOK, I KNOW YOUR DAD
WAS AN ACCOUNTANT
FOR SEA LARK--

913
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,745
JOE BUDDHA'S LITTLE
GAS SCAM.

914
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,539
SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW
THAT GOT THESE GUYS
TO TURN ON EACH OTHER?

915
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:08,542
JOE BUDDHA DOESN'T DESERVE
TO LIVE AND BREATHE.

916
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,089
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?

917
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:17,885
HE KILLED MY FATHER.

918
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,361
Alma:
<i>MY DAD WAS AN ACCOUNTANT,</i>

919
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,280
<i>AN HONEST ONE.</i>

920
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,574
<i>HE MADE THE MISTAKE</i>
<i>OF TAKING ON</i>

921
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:43,410
<i>THE SEA LARK BOOKS</i>
<i>FOR JOE BUDDHA,</i>

922
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,997
<i>MICHAEL NOCERA</i>
<i>AND TONY D.</i>

923
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,647
<i>BY THE TIME</i>
<i>MY DAD REALIZED</i>

924
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,649
<i>WHO HIS REAL</i>
<i>BOSSES WERE,</i>

925
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,651
<i>HE WAS IN TOO DEEP.</i>

926
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,778
<i>( gunshot )</i>

927
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,454
YOU NEVER TOLD ANYBODY
WHAT YOU SAW?

928
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,915
OF COURSE I DID.

929
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:32,334
YOU THINK
THEY BELIEVED ME?

930
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,962
THE COPS SAID
IT WAS SUICIDE.

931
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,548
SOMEBODY GOT PAID OFF.

932
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:45,097
YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS
FOR 15 YEARS.

933
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,313
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ANYMORE.

934
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,773
DO YOU REALIZE

935
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,234
YOU'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY
LIVING WITNESS

936
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:01,071
THAT'S EVER SEEN JOE BUDDHA
COMMIT A MURDER HIMSELF?

937
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,949
YOU COULD FORCE HIM
TO TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE.

938
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,076
THIS COULD BE
THE BUST OF THE CENTURY.

939
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,078
THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
COULD HAND DOWN

940
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,080
DOZENS OF INDICTMENTS
RIGHT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

941
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,416
JOE BUDDHA'S GONNA WALK?

942
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,919
THAT'S JUSTICE ALL RIGHT.

943
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,422
JOE BUDDHA
IN WITNESS PROTECTION

944
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:21,300
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR PROSECUTIONS
ON THAT SCALE.

945
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,969
ALMA, YOU WANT TO NAIL
THESE GUYS?

946
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,138
YOU FUCKING REALLY
WANT TO NAIL THEM?

947
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,891
YOU COULD ROLL UP
HIS ENTIRE FAMILY.

948
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,893
WASTING THAT
SON OF A BITCH

949
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,687
WOULD FEEL
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

950
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:37,608
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET
NEXT TO JOE WITH A GUN,

951
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:40,486
NOT NOW.

952
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,905
YOU NEED ME
TO GET TO HIM.

953
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,741
I CAN WORK IT OUT SO THAT
I'D BE THERE WITH YOU.

954
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,910
I WOULD BE THERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

955
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,287
LIKE YOU WERE THERE
WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN--

956
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:53,207
THE ONE
THAT WORE THE WIRE?

957
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,805
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

958
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,894
FORGET I ASKED.

959
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:35,958
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

960
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,423
<i>( Alma's voice )</i>
<i>Look, it was an incredible</i>
<i>night, okay?</i>

961

<i>at that.</i>

962
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,725
<i>( Jack's voice )</i>
<i>We'll have a lot</i>
<i>of nights like that.</i>

963
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,144
( turns off player )

964
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:59,189
WHAT'S THE MATTER, JACK?
IT GETS BETTER.

965
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:01,191
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH A KEY SUSPECT

966
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:04,528
IN THE MOST IMPORTANT
O.C. INVESTIGATION
IN 20 YEARS.

967
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:07,740
AND WHAT'S WORSE, I THINK
YOU'RE PROTECTING HER.

968
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,200
EVERYONE WHO GETS MIXED UP
WITH THIS WOMAN

969
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,202
ENDS UP ON A SLAB
AT THE MORGUE.

970
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:13,829
DO YOU WANT
TO BE NEXT?

971
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,958
SALLY, I--

972
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:21,128
I AM SO CLOSE
TO GETTING SOMETHING.

973
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,672
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S TRAGIC
IS THAT THERE'S A PART OF ME

974
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:28,427
THAT WANTS
TO BELIEVE YOU.

975
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,180
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO HAVE JENNINGS
TAKE YOU OFF THE CASE.

976
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,350
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CALL I.A.D.

977
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,352
THERE'S GONNA BE
AN INVESTIGATION.

978
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,145
THIS IS A MESS.

979
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:41,982
LISTEN, I CAN DELIVER
JOE BUDDHA

980
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:43,984
IN 48 HOURS,

981
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,986
READY TO TURN
STATE'S EVIDENCE.

982
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,988
IMPOSSIBLE.

983
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:50,657
IF I DON'T DO THIS,

984
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,659
I'LL GIVE YOU MY BADGE
AND MY GUN

985
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,537
WITH PLEASURE.

986
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,671
- HEY, MOTHERFUCKER, YOU GOT
SOME 'SPLAINING TO DO.
- HEY, MAN, FUCK YOU.

987
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:07,132
YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK
AND GIVE THOSE TAPES TO
SALLY CLAIRE? WHY, PHIL?

988
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:09,218
I DIDN'T TELL CLAIRE
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

989
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,178
SHE ALREADY KNEW
ABOUT YOU AND ALMA.

990
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,722
IT WAS EITHER
HAND OVER THE TAPES
OR LOSE MY FUCKING JOB.

991
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,266
SO YOU COULDN'T
TELL ME YOURSELF?

992
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,685
LOOK, JACK,

993
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,814
I'M SORRY, MAN,
BUT I NEED THIS JOB,
YOU KNOW?

994
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,608
I GOT A WIFE
THAT DEPENDS ON ME.
COME ON.

995
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:27,277
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

996
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,030
LOOK, YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT EASY, YOU KNOW?

997
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,783
YOU LOSE IT AGAIN,
THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA
GIVE YOU YOUR DESK JOB.

998
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:36,370
THEY'RE GONNA KICK YOU
OFF THE DAMN FORCE.

999
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,093
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

1000
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,387
- YEAH?
<i>IT'S ME.</i>

1001
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,980
OKAY, I'LL DO IT

1002
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,774
YOUR WAY.

1003
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,878
YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED
MY DAD.

1004
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,797
I KNOW I WOULD HAVE.

1005
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:33,802
DO YOU KNOW HOW BLUE
THE SKY IS IN MEXICO?

1006
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,221
HUH-UH.
HOW BLUE?

1007
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:39,933
IT IS BLUE LIKE
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN.

1008
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:43,479
AND I KNOW A PLACE
WHERE THE SAND ISN'T WHITE,

1009
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,481
IT'S PINK.

1010
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,900
PINK SAND?

1011
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,027
I LIKE THAT.

1012
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:03,707
Tommy:
<i>...A MINIATURE STEINWAY,</i>
<i>RIGHT?</i>

1013
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:06,043
AND THE GENIE SAYS,

1014
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,462
"I'M SORRY, LADY.
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT

1015
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,757
A 9" PIANIST."

1016
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,509
CUTE.

1017
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,260
TOMMY, LET ME SEE YOU.
COME HERE.

1018
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,887
HEY, JACK,
HOW IS IT GOING?

1019
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,514
GOOD. LET ME
SEE YOU, PLEASE.

1020
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,933
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.
SURE. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1021
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,519
LISTEN, I NEED TO GET
A WORD WITH JOEY B.

1022
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,521
CAN YOU HOOK THAT UP
FOR ME?

1023
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:29,066
JESUS, JACK, FUCK.
I'M GRATEFUL AND
EVERYTHING,

1024
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,568
BUT YOU'RE PUTTING ME
ON THE FUCKING SPOT HERE.

1025
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,570
TOMMY, ONE LITTLE
CONVERSATION.

1026
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,572
PLEASE SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

1027
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:38,867
ONE LITTLE CONVERSATION,
THAT'S ALL I NEED.
AND YOU CAN DO THAT.

1028
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,789
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
DETECTIVE.

1029
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,459
TWO BIG GUYS ARE DEAD.
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE
JOE IS EVEN.

1030
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,044
ARE YOU SAYING
HE'S SCARED?

1031
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:52,047
JOE? HE AIN'T BEEN SCARED
IN 30 YEARS.

1032
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,509
HE'S WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
CONCERNED, ALL RIGHT, BUT--

1033
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,011
I'M CONCERNED.
EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED.

1034
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,723
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
THE MAN SOME USEFUL
INFORMATION.

1035
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,725
OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL?

1036
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,394
<i>I WANT TO HAVE DINNER</i>
<i>WITH THE GUY,</i>

1037
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,396
COMPLETELY OFF THE RECORD.

1038
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,106
CAN YOU SET THAT UP?

1039
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,998
I CAN'T BELIEVE
KEENAN AGREED TO THIS.

1040
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,750
WELL, HE DIDN'T
ACTUALLY AGREE.

1041
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,879
WHAT, YOU MEAN
HE DOESN'T KNOW?

1042
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,881
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

1043
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:37,384
WAIT, WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU MEAN, NOT EXACTLY?

1044
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:40,262
KEENAN FINDS OUT THAT
WE'RE RUNNING OUR OWN
PERSONAL BLACK OPS HERE,

1045
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,681
HE'S GONNA SHITCAN
THE BOTH OF US,
GOD DAMN IT.

1046
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,601
PHIL, PHIL, LOOK,
JUST WORK WITH ME
ON THIS ONE, OKAY?

1047
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,020
NOW YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT PIMPED ME ON THE TAPES
TO SALLY CLAIRE.

1048
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,398
I PIMPED YOU?
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT GOT
INVOLVED WITH A WITNESS, JACK.

1049
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,400
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT HER
WEARING THE WIRE.

1050
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,444
DOES THIS SOUND
FAMILIAR?

1051
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,613
PHIL, ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS SIT IN THIS LITTLE VAN,

1052
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,991
PRESS "RECORD"
AND HOPE THIS SHIT WORKS.
CAN YOU PLEASE DO THAT?

1053
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,081
HOW IS THIS GIRL

1054
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,584
GONNA GET JOE B
TO TURN ANYWAY?

1055
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,669
LET ME WORRY
ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

1056
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,343
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE.

1057
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:28,185
OH, JESUS CHRIST.

1058
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,520
DETECTIVE, MY PEOPLE
TELL ME

1059
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,773
YOU'RE A VERY
COMPASSIONATE GUY,

1060
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:37,277
AN ODDBALL,
BUT VERY KIND INDIVIDUAL.
AND I LIKE THAT.

1061
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:39,279
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THAT, JOE.

1062
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,281
OF COURSE
YOU'RE COMPASSIONATE

1063
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,576
SO FUCKING MOPES TAKE YOU
INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE.
( chuckling )

1064
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,578
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK.

1065
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:48,789
WELL, PEOPLE SKILLS
CAN BE HELPFUL, YES.

1066
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,458
<i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>( door opens )</i>

1067
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:56,755
WHAT'S THIS, DETECTIVE?
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
DINE ALONE.

1068
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,715
<i>Well, Alma here</i>
<i>is a friend of mine.</i>

1069
01:17:58,715 --> 01:18:00,509
<i>She's been dying</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

1070
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,511
<i>And I think you're gonna</i>
<i>want to hear her out.</i>

1071
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,513
<i>Sit down, sweetheart.</i>

1072
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,848
<i>Now Tommy said you had</i>
<i>some information for me?</i>

1073
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:11,019
<i>Well, actually</i>
<i>Alma's the one</i>
<i>with the information.</i>

1074
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:14,064
SO WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

1075
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:18,527
I HELPED MICHAEL NOCERA
KILL YOUR PAL TONY D.

1076
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:25,492
<i>I TOLD MICHAEL</i>
<i>THAT YOU AND TONY</i>
<i>WERE SKIMMING HIM</i>

1077
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,994
<i>ON THE GAS TAX SCAM</i>
<i>THAT HE INVENTED.</i>

1078
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:30,789
<i>AND THEN I MADE YOU</i>
<i>KILL NOCERA</i>

1079
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,875
BY MAKING SURE
THAT YOU KNEW THAT
THE TWO OF US WERE TOGETHER.

1080
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,426
WHO IS THIS LADY?
SHE'S CRAZY.

1081
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,639
MARIAN HAMILTON.

1082
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,976
<i>YOU REMEMBER</i>
<i>A COMPANY CALLED</i>

1083
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,936
<i>THE SEA LARK</i>
<i>COMPANY, JOE?</i>

01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:55,397
SEA LARK?

1085
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,194
SEA LARK-- THAT'S A NAME
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF
IN A LONG TIME.

1086
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,240
<i>THAT'S BECAUSE</i>
<i>IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME</i>

1087
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,242
<i>SINCE YOU KILLED</i>
<i>FRED HAMILTON.</i>

1088
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,911
<i>HE WAS THE ACCOUNTANT</i>
<i>FOR YOUR GAS STATIONS--</i>

1089

MY FATHER.

1090
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,421
FRED HAMILTON.

1091
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:26,052
HE WAS A NICE MAN.

1092
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:28,638
HE WAS TOO HONEST.
THAT WAS HIS PROBLEM.

1093
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:32,142
<i>SO YOU KILLED HIM.</i>

1094
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,689
MARIAN HAMILTON--

1095
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:40,066
EYEWITNESS TO THE MURDER

01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,739
<i>NOW SHE SAW YOU</i>
<i>KILL HER FATHER, JOE.</i>

1097
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,160
<i>Now you can die in jail</i>
<i>serving out a life sentence</i>

1098
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,787
<i>for the murder</i>
<i>of Fred Hamilton,</i>

1099
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:54,372
OR WE CAN MAKE A DEAL.

1100
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,085
- A DEAL?
- THEY'RE GONNA GET YOU
SOONER OR LATER, MAN.

1101
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:02,088
<i>MAKE A DEAL WITH ME NOW.</i>

01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:28,323
JOE, I LIED.
IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY.
I'M SORRY.
