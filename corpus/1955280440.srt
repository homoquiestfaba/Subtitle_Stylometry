1
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,076
<i>Father...</i>

2
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,446
<i>where are you?</i>

3
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,270
<i>Father...</i>

4
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,853
<i>speak to me.</i>

5
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,665
I have water for you here, Yeshua.

6
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,149
That's what your mother
calls you, isn't it?

7
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,255
Any name that's good enough for Mary
is good enough for me.

8
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,664
And what does your father call you?

9
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,201
Yeshua.

10
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,204
Hello?

11
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:48,731
I'm looking for water. I can work for it.

12
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,739
- What can you do?
- Whatever's needed.

13
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,555
You're building up here.
I know carpentry and stone.

14
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:10,369
- Where are you headed?
- Jerusalem, but I'm a little lost.

15
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,499
Where are you coming from?

16
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,001
From spending time in the desert.

17
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,900
Why? There's nothing here.

18
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,207
What is Jerusalem like?

19
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:37,137
Dirty and corrupt.

20
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,684
But also alive. Very alive.

21
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,993
- Do you have a father?
- Yes. He's out.

22
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,597
- He'll ask me if I offered you food.
- That's not necessary.

23
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,649
Thank you.

24
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,483
Stay. Please. Rest for a while.

25
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,284
Talking to your father
is like talking to a rock.

26
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,033
He's so busy with his little things,
the shape of a drop of dew,

27
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:30,137
the sound roots make breaking
their way through the ground.

28
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,205
Everything matters more to him than you.

29
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,207
No.

30
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,673
My father loves me.

31
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,147
He is amused by you.

32
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,713
He loves himself only.

33
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,590
Are you lost?

34
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,955
No.

35
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,164
Are you one of those preachers?

36
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:01,911
Looking for something here in the desert
that you can't find anywhere else?

37
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:08,428
How long have you been out here, holy man?

38
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,212
Since the last full moon.
Maybe a little longer.

39
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,747
Alone?

40
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:17,513
No. You people are never alone.

41
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,307
Some spirit or something
is always with you, isn't it?

42
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,628
Tell me one thing you've learned out here,
and I'll offer you shelter for the night.

43
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:33,129
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Please. It would give me pleasure.

44
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,570
Man makes do anywhere.

45
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,413
Because he is man.

46
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,373
Good.

47
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,934
Give me a hand with this.

48
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,356
Thank you.

49
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:51,392
- There's no need to wait for her.
- I don't mean to offend, but I'm fasting.

50
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,354
What is it?

51
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:04,555
She thinks it's funny
that she wants to eat but can't...

52
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:08,018
and our guest, who can, won't.

53
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,233
What are you building up there?

54
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,570
A house for me to live in.

55
00:17:56,342 --> 00:18:01,014
My father wants me to stay here.
To help him make something of this place.

56
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,812
Is that what you want?

57
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,984
What is it that you want?

58
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,425
I want to go to Jerusalem.

59
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,799
And I want to see the sea.

60
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,968
And I want to see
the lighthouse at Alexandria.

61
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,766
And does your father know that?

62
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,273
No.

63
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,238
Why don't you talk to him about it?

64
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,617
I've seen Jerusalem.

65
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:44,052
<i>I've walked away without my father
knowing and I've seen it from a ridge.</i>

66
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,777
<i>It shines in the sun and I want it
so much, I could scream.</i>

67
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,237
I don't want to waste my time here.

68
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,802
Wasting life is a sin.

69
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,739
I want to leave my footprint on the world.

70
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,496
Come, holy man.

71
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,524
Oh, this isn't necessary.
I can sleep outside.

72
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,222
No. She won't bother you.

73
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,780
Rabbi?

74
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,750
Rabbi.

75
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,823
I've committed a horrible sin.

76
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,752
My son is not my husband's son.

77
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,098
I don't want to die...

78
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,935
and leave this lie behind me.

79
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,200
I don't want my son trapped here forever.

80
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,723
Help me, please.

81
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:13,326
In your holy man comings-and-goings...

82
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:16,191
have you learned any medicine?

83
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,934
Cures are the only things worth seeking.

84
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:27,069
For pain... suffering.

85
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:31,206
The rest is just...

86
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:37,415
This boy is good
at taking care of the sick.

87
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,915
He's had practice, unfortunately.

88
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:46,554
If he had come into this world somewhere
else, he could have made it his life's work.

89
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,658
And what did you want for yourself
when you were a boy?

90
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,367
I wanted to raise livestock...

91
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:58,016
and be a butcher, like my father.

92
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,409
He never taught me any of it, though.

93
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:06,812
He said it had taken him years and years

94
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,746
to master the skill on his own,
and he wasn't just going to give it away.

95
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:17,322
"Every man must make himself."
I heard that a thousand times.

96
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,854
He was a selfish man.

97
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,958
And he died alone.

98
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,834
What does your father do?

99
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,870
Ask for permission
when you address a guest, boy.

100
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,235
That's all right. We spoke some yesterday.

101
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,876
My father's a carpenter.

102
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,180
Smart man.

103
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,645
A man who is good at work like that
can always provide for his children.

104
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:51,728
And did you want to be a carpenter also
when you were a boy?

105
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,282
Your good intentions will be wasted here.

106
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:15,243
They don't need us to ruin their lives.
They'll do that all by themselves.

107
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,198
Do you know what I do
when they're finally mine?

108
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:23,217
I have them watch the life they've lived
over and over again. Forever.

109
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,825
Oh, what anger.

110
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,490
You are your father's son.

111
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,098
Very well. I'll stay out of it.
Surprise me.

112
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:37,866
- And if I do?
- A wager?

113
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,059
If you can solve
this entanglement, this knot...

114
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,424
to the satisfaction of the mother,
the father and the child,

115
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:50,989
I'll stay out of your way
for the rest of your journey home.

116
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,090
And if I fail?

117
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,855
Failure is its own punishment.

118
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,261
- That's Daddy talk.
- Enough for the day.

119
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,341
This is all just an excuse
to delay your departure, isn't it?

120
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,810
Because you're scared to go on.
Scared out of your head.

121
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,363
You're not ready and you know it.

122
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,401
Here.

123
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,194
What part of a bird doesn't fly?

124
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,686
It's a riddle.
What part of a bird doesn't fly?

125
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,106
I don't know.

126
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,238
Its shadow.

127
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,947
- Did you make that up?
- Yes.

128
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,178
It's good.

129
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,134
Yes.

130
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,099
I want the boy to learn a trade.

131
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,170
There's plenty for him
to learn right here.

132
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,179
Any trade that he wants.

133
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,312
Or that you want for him.

134
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,082
In Jerusalem, perhaps.

135
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,295
I want this very much.

136
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,700
I would need money for that.
Just to get him set up and started.

137
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,602
No one will take him
as an apprentice without payment.

138
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,735
For food, at least.

139
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,642
Impossible.

140
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,945
You are...

141
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,282
a powerful...

142
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,450
resourceful...

143
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,187
beautiful man...

144
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,019
and you will find a way.

145
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,456
I know it.

146
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,718
I cannot do my dying while he's here.

147
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:54,766
My father was 47 when he had me.
My mother was 20.

148
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,625
He had another wife before her,
but she died.

149
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,937
And now my mother will die too.

150
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,495
And my father says
a man makes his own luck.

151
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,430
No.

152
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,371
What did he do to make two wives die?

153
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:15,974
Nothing.

154
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,606
I agree with you.

155
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,283
Do you have a wife or children?

156
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,522
Do you plan to?

157
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,460
Well, you never know, right?

158
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:51,877
- Have you ever sailed on a boat?
- Yes, I have.

159
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:55,746
- Is it scary?
- It can be terrifying.

160
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,329
But mostly it's thrilling.

161
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,924
My father sailed on a boat once.

162
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,663
He said he got caught in a storm at sea.

163
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,499
He said it was a nightmare.

164
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,172
Everything outside of our world
is scary to him.

165
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,104
My father says once my mother
is buried here that we cannot leave.

166
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,210
He says a grave ties a man
to the land forever.

167
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,246
Do you think I'm selfish
because I don't want to live here?

168
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:58,828
No.

169
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,222
My father has lived here his whole life...

170
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,459
and he's lived it the way he wanted to.

171
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,463
But now it's my turn. Men take turns.

172
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,374
I am not a bad son.

173
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,806
I'm not.

174
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,052
I am not a bad son!

175
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:37,591
I am not a bad son!

176
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,628
I'm not a bad son!

177
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,040
I am not a bad son!

178
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,438
<i>Rabbi?</i>

179
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,507
Rabbi!

180
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,978
It hurts.

181
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,586
I want it to be over.

182
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,419
I'm not afraid of death.

183
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:23,924
I'm only scared of being alone
when I get there.

184
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,695
You will not be alone.

185
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:31,834
None of us is alone.

186
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,925
Find better words, Yeshua.
You must work at that.

187
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:46,684
Intention is good, but...

188
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,850
often the words are hollow and useless.

189
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,790
Or better still...

190
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,125
find an action.

191
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,091
Yes.

192
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,460
Action over words. Always.

193
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,331
Otherwise, silence.

194
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,980
You think you are his only child?

195
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:04,885
There are others.

196
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,122
No.

197
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,226
There is only me.

198
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,897
There is only me.

199
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,353
Look in on your mother.

200
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,075
Did the boy speak with you
when you went to the water?

201
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,240
A little.

202
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:09,088
I don't know how to talk to him.
The words get caught in my throat.

203
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:14,258
I fight to push them through
and they come out harsh.

204
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,018
I suppose he thinks I'm angry at him.

205
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:21,528
He doesn't know me...

206
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,932
and I don't know him.

207
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,530
Any words of advice, holy man?

208
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,597
Talk to him about something
that he's interested in.

209
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,384
What is he interested in?

210
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,894
Riddles.

211
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,879
He makes up a very good riddle.

212
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,161
I don't like riddles.

213
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,488
That shooting star last night.
You enjoyed that.

214
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,191
- It was a bore.
- Liar.

215
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,322
I am a liar. That is the truth.

216
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,367
I've seen every shooting star
since the first one.

217
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,100
Every flash of lightning.

218
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,074
I've heard the last gasp
of each thing that ever lived.

219
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,477
Nothing's interesting anymore.

220
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:43,243
Nothing surprises you? Not a thing?

221
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,654
The repetitiveness.

222
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:55,928
The obstinate, dull repetitiveness of your
father's plan is bewildering to me.

223
00:44:56,228 --> 00:45:00,964
The same lives lived over
and over and over and over again.

224
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:03,201
Is there a plan?

225
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:07,594
It all has to turn into something, it has to
pour out into something, but into what?

226
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,004
And that's my weakness...

227
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,241
curiosity.

228
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,549
But I'll stay as long
as it takes, forever...

229
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:21,685
to witness the end.

230
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,534
The final sunset. If there is one.

231
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:29,995
Maybe on that day,
late in the afternoon, seconds away,

232
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:32,896
he'll want to start it all over again...

233
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,065
from the beginning.

234
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:39,738
He's done it before. Recreated
the whole thing, retold the whole thing.

235
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:42,924
On a whim. With little differences
that must mean the world to him,

236
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:45,210
a branch that crooks
in a different direction,

237
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:49,009
one egg more or less
in the nest of a flea.

238
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,329
What a self-centered...

239
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:55,007
self-indulgent creature he is. Isn't he?

240
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:58,752
Deaf-mute. Insatiable.

241
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,593
These things he expects of you.

242
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,062
Do you think anyone will care?

243
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,061
Men of 1,000 years from now?

244
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:20,857
What's it like to be in his presence?

245
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,348
Is there a face?

246
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:30,751
No.

247
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,488
There is no face.

248
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:39,192
There is no face.

249
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,797
There's a thing that swallows you.

250
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,770
It holds you together while it's
tearing you apart and it's terrifying.

251
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,477
It makes you feel worthless...

252
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,576
and it makes you want to be worthless.

253
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:03,617
And all the while, it makes you believe
that you and he are one and the same...

254
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:08,222
That... that is...

255
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,262
Well, that can be quite confusing.

256
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:25,010
That's how I remember it, anyway.

257
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,613
It's been a million years since he
so much as looked in my direction.

258
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:33,480
- Your pride made him angry.
- I'm not proud. I am not proud.

259
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:36,750
He's the proud one.

260
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,995
- How's our little wager going?
- I do not wager.

261
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:47,126
Oh, dear me, course not.

262
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:58,275
- What?
- You already know the outcome, don't you?

263
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,380
- No. Not at all.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

264
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,716
I am able to do that generally, yes.

265
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:09,382
But when it comes to you
and your little things, not always.

266
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,955
I could tell you what would've happened if
you'd passed by this place a moment earlier.

267
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,695
Would you like to know?

268
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,266
The boy would not have met you.

269
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,143
After the mother's death,

270
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,580
his relationship
with the father deteriorates.

271
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,381
He puts up with it for several years,
expecting that the father will not live long.

272
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:48,125
Eventually, he poisons the father
and is hanged for it.

273
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:52,230
Along the way, the boy
has a son who remains here.

274
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,262
Like the grandfather, he loves the desert.

275
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,769
That's how it would have been this time.

276
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,775
In previous tellings of the world,
it was all a little different.

277
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,708
Sometimes it was nothing but love
between the father and the son.

278
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,013
That's how your father amuses himself.

279
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,723
Now it's your turn to take a hand.

280
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,222
Can you do any better?

281
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,341
Why do you live here?

282
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:41,679
Because the desert is ruthless.

283
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,517
It strips you of your vanities,
your illusions, and...

284
00:49:45,617 --> 00:49:49,487
gives you the opportunity
to see yourself for who you are.

285
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,624
Isn't that why you're here?

286
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:57,991
Because your god speaks louder here?

287
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,128
God speaks wherever a man wants to listen.

288
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,675
What I said to you about my son...

289
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:13,744
It doesn't matter that we don't talk.

290
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,880
We're not women.

291
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,045
A father talks through example.

292
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,719
He's the best boy in the world.

293
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,558
Too good, perhaps.

294
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:42,140
Do you see that?
The smooth rock jutting out.

295
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,242
- Just below the crack there.
- The reddish rock?

296
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:47,378
Yes. That's Jasper stone. I'm sure of it.

297
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,048
I need a sample to take to market.

298
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:54,218
- I would share any profits with you.
- No, that wouldn't be necessary.

299
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,956
I can't in good conscience allow you
to do more work for nothing.

300
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,489
If you don't want the money,
you give it to the poor.

301
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,558
How would you go about it?

302
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,971
It would take three people.

303
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,274
Two to lower the third.

304
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:21,100
Yes, that's right.
You and I would lower the boy.

305
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,380
Just to pick at the rock.

306
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,981
And if it's all that I think it is,
I will return with laborers and dig deep.

307
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,019
It could change the course of our lives.

308
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,322
The boy's life, anyway.

309
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:06,657
I feel better.

310
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:10,809
You do? Good. That's good.

311
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,836
My mother had this when she was my age.

312
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:26,806
And then she was fine.

313
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,964
My father, my sisters and I...

314
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,297
once spent a night in Jaffa.

315
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:53,870
Did I tell you this already?

316
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,335
Tell me again.

317
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,874
My father's cousin put us up by the port.

318
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,114
I could barely sleep...

319
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:07,246
with the sounds of the city...

320
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:10,083
dogs barking...

321
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,557
music from a wedding...

322
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,923
men quarreling...

323
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,626
a pig brought to slaughter...

324
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,697
a drunk woman laughing.

325
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,167
And the smells...

326
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,041
pepper, cedar wood...

327
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,844
garum.

328
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,029
If you're ever there...

329
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:00,100
you think of me.

330
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,770
Yes. I will.

331
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:26,450
I took her to doctors,
brought doctors to her.

332
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:31,917
Magicians, quacks. I tried them all.

333
00:54:34,387 --> 00:54:36,953
She's going to die, holy man.

334
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,807
There is nothing to be done about her.

335
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:46,205
When her eyes close for the last time...

336
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:50,991
our whole world will come
to an end forever.

337
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,718
It's stunning, isn't it?

338
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,760
That life ends.

339
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,065
You will meet again.

340
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,580
We will have been here together.

341
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,478
And we leave the boy behind.

342
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,381
That'll have to do.

343
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,963
How far can a man walk into the desert?

344
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:47,138
Only halfway.

345
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,835
After that, he's walking out.

346
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,952
When you leave,
you could take me with you.

347
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,888
I could pass for your son.

348
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:06,824
That would be believable, wouldn't it?

349
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:10,026
Believable, yes, but nevertheless a lie.

350
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,729
But a lie that wouldn't hurt anyone.

351
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:14,381
My mother and father
wouldn't be there to hear it.

352
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:17,246
A lie hurts the person who tells it.

353
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:27,578
You could adopt me.
That way it wouldn't be a lie.

354
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30,910
The Romans do it all the time,
adopt each other.

355
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,322
Have you found what you
were looking for out here?

356
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,495
Yes. Yes, I have.

357
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,999
What were you looking for?

358
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:59,972
I was looking for a place to reflect
and to pray in peace.

359
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,877
A place to look inward and to find myself.

360
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,015
I walk out there, too.

361
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,493
Sometimes when I'm out there,

362
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:18,491
I feel this thing rising inside of me,

363
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,717
that I am everything
and that everything is me.

364
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,699
That I will always be alive. Forever.

365
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,043
And it's very conceited,
I know, to feel that way.

366
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,742
I'm ashamed of that feeling.

367
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,553
Some wine, holy man?

368
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,718
No. Thank you.

369
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,929
Boy. Boy.

370
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,106
You are an easy target.

371
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,738
Because you're weak.

372
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,039
- How's your mother doing?
- She's feeling better.

373
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,729
She thinks it's passing.

374
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,806
Take your knife, boy.

375
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,117
Just in case.

376
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,759
If I had fallen behind like that,

377
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:45,624
my father would have caned me
on the soles of my feet.

378
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:05,544
Come.

379
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:27,338
I am stronger than 10 men...

380
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:31,937
and I am taller than 10 men,
but a boy can carry me.

381
01:03:32,274 --> 01:03:34,573
What am I?

382
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,078
It's a riddle.

383
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,921
I am stronger than 10 men,

384
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:47,499
I'm longer than 10 men,
and a boy can carry me.

385
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,822
What am I?

386
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,531
A rope.

387
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,328
It's a rope.

388
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,211
Come.

389
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,846
Come.

390
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,539
Do you see that piece of rock?

391
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,343
The holy man and I
will lower you with rope.

392
01:04:55,443 --> 01:04:59,975
All you have to do is chisel out a piece
and we'll pull you back up.

393
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:02,995
No.

394
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,803
No. I'm not going down there.

395
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:10,135
You will.

396
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:14,044
No. You know I'm afraid
of falling from high places.

397
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:16,775
That is precisely why you will do it.

398
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:20,334
I will not do it!
I'm not going down there!

399
01:05:20,434 --> 01:05:23,187
You will not disobey me.
You will regret it.

400
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:27,239
He knows I'm scared to death of heights.
What kind of father asks me to do this?

401
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:32,168
Please. Please, let him go.
Let him go. I can go down.

402
01:05:32,268 --> 01:05:34,993
I'll do it. I'll do it.

403
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,406
I will go down myself.

404
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:25,644
Do you think it can be done?
Just you and the boy to hold the ropes?

405
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:32,151
Yes.

406
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:25,853
Boy!

407
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:30,007
Cut yourself from the rope.
You too, holy man.

408
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,665
I'll only drag you over if I slip again.

409
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,443
No!

410
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,788
What is it?

411
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,797
What is it? What is it?

412
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,838
I don't want my mother
to see him like this.

413
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,999
He looks so much smaller now, doesn't he?

414
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,782
You are a good son.

415
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,447
Your son loves you.

416
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,784
Your son loves you.

417
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:44,616
Your son loves you.
He is your son and he loves you.

418
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,350
Am I expected to just walk away now?

419
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:23,771
As if I'd never met these people?

420
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:27,223
As if they mean nothing to me?

421
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,798
Mother!

422
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:44,069
Mother!

423
01:24:15,983 --> 01:24:17,882
Go.

424
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,152
Please, go.

425
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:38,808
If I leave here without a blessing,
I won't make it one night out there.

426
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:42,710
A boy needs his father's permission
to become a man.

427
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,976
It's perverse, isn't it?

428
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:57,189
Love God above all things.

429
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,727
Love life.

430
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,838
Show me his destiny.

431
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:45,803
- Yeshua...
- Show me now!

432
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:20,442
You could have pulled the father up
and seven heavier men if you'd wanted to.

433
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,773
That's nonsense.

434
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:32,363
No. She's mine!

435
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:28,506
No.

436
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,065
Who the hell do you think you are?

437
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:48,352
This is it for me.

438
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:53,207
You didn't think I was going
to walk you all the way, did you?

439
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,830
Why here?

440
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,529
My feet hurt.

441
01:29:17,252 --> 01:29:19,355
I'll come to you in the end.

442
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:22,452
And if you give me a sign
I'll help you down...

443
01:29:22,552 --> 01:29:24,853
and you can stay.

444
01:29:37,088 --> 01:29:39,620
Give my regards to the old man.
