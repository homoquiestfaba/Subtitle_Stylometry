Gaily digging and scattering"

673
01:46:03,156 --> 01:46:05,560
"And in answer
to their treble interjections"

674
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,696
"The sun beats lightning
on the waves"

675
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,464
"The waves fold thunder
on the sand"

676
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:15,135
"And could they hear me
I would tell them"

677
01:46:15,135 --> 01:46:19,039
"O brilliant kids,
frisk with your dog"

678
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:24,111
"Fondle your shells
and sticks, bleached
By time and the elements"

679
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:28,450
"But there is a line
You must not cross
nor ever trust beyond it"

680
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:30,552
"Spry cordage
of your bodies to caresses"

681
01:46:30,552 --> 01:46:33,654
"Too lichen-faithful
from too wide a breast."

682
01:46:35,522 --> 01:46:38,024
"The bottom of the sea
is cruel."

683
01:46:39,661 --> 01:46:40,761
(MILD APPLAUSE)

684
01:46:44,932 --> 01:46:46,100
HART: Okay. Thank you.
