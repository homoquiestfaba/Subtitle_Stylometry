we win the five million.

- Hi.
- Hm?

184
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,456
You were picked for
the beta too?

185
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,376
- Mm-hm.
- [Eason chuckles]

186
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,577
Their games are great.
I've played every single one.

187
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,657
Wow, cool.

188
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,512
[Eason]
Oh, what do you think that is?

189
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,048
I'm gonna go check it out.

190
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,960
- [Eric chuckles]
- [Eason] Oh, I recognize this.

191
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,393
- [chuckles] It's the...
- Oh!

192
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,705
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

193
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:00,696
Excuse me.

194
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,144
Um, I'm...

195
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:07,128
Whoa.

[chuckles]

197
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,408
[Eric] Uh, hi, Peter.

198
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,025
The name's Eric. I know you.

199
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,401
Yeah? Well, I don't know you.

200
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,504
- [Eason] Sorry.
- Beat it.

201
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,201
My friend must be mixed up.

is pretty realistic, huh?

[testers laughing]

207
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,929
Hello, players. Welcome.

208
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,200
- You made it.
- [testers applauding]

[Eason chuckles]

210
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,856
[Russell] This game is like nothing
you've ever experienced before.

211
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,168
There are two things
to remember.

212
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,800
First, when you enter the game,

213
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,081
there will be
backpacks scattered

214
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:50,616
throughout the starting field.

215
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:53,560
Each one will carry a variety of
equipment to aid you.

216
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,928
<i>The second is that
there are no rules.</i>

217
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,848
<i>Players still alive
after four hours</i>

218
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,345
<i>share the grand prize
pot of five million.</i>

219
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,032
<i>And if you're the last one
standing, you take it all.</i>

220
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:05,401
<i>Now get ready. Start-up can be
a bit disorienting.</i>

221
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,537
<i>Welcome to "Dinosaur World."</i>

222
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,744

- [Eason chuckles]
- This game is tougher than I expected.

240
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:20,634
You could've left me
to die back there.

241
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:24,728
- Thank me later. We still got 12 hours in here.

I know it's not real,

I've never been so scared
before.

Did you fart?

00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:47,864
Huh? It's you.

296
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,369
Huh?

297
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,512
You're covered in dinosaur spit.

302
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,545
I suppose they meant it when
they said it was real, huh?

303
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,976
- That?

If this part feels real,

307
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,728
then what would being
eaten feel like?

[raptor calling]

327
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:21,784
We should head back now and
see if there are any bags left.

[tense music]

331
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:31,929
Lily, grab that one.

332
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,168
With a little cover,

333
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,056
this place should be
safe for a while.

334
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,385
If we're lucky, the T-rex scared
away the other players

335
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,592
and, hopefully, the smaller
dinosaurs as well.

336
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:52,504
[Eason] If we're lucky?
That's not exactly a reassuring sentiment.

337
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:54,392
I can't guarantee anything.

338
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,865
We know next to nothing
about the game.

339
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,320
That said, if it's like
the others I've played,

340
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,104
hiding won't work for long.

341
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,047
Sooner or later,
it's fight or flight.

342
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,104
[chuckles]

343
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,856
- What d'you think?
- Huh?

344
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,847
It's good.

345
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,632
- Let's rest.
- Oh, yeah.

346
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:14,584
- Huh?
- My name is Eason, by the way.

347
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:16,536
Oh. Eric.

348
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,624
Nice to meet you.

349
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,865
I think we should team up
if we want to win.

350
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:21,400
I can really use that
prize money.

351
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,737
Yeah, sounds good.
Hope we make it.

352
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,680
Did you have a look
in your bag yet?

353
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:28,184
Not yet.

354
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,896
Hm.

355
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:39,097
- I got a rope, looks like.
- [Eason chuckles]

356
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,360
Rope against dinosaurs?
What good is this?

357
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:43,704
Whoa!

358
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:47,896
- [knife rasps]
- Got this knife too.

359
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,336
Mm.

360
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,216
Seriously, talk about
ineffective.

361
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,007
- Not against players.
- Huh?

362
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,249
[Eason chuckles]

363
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:01,560
[laughs]
Hey! Medicine.

364
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,471
I may live through
this after all.

365
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:07,641
When I fell during the chase,
I got scratched up.

366
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,737
Hey, help me with this?

367
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:13,625
It'll probably sting a bit.

368
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,127
[Eason chuckles]

369
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:18,585
I'm tough. I survived a Tyrannosaurus rex.
I can take anything...

370
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,177
- [Eason screams]
- Really, tough guy?

371
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,807
[both chuckling]

372
00:19:23,736 --> 00:19:25,591
- [Eason groans]
- Don't be so loud, dude.

373
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,567
- Just a bit more.
- [Eason chuckles]

374
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,487
- All right, calm down, dude.
- [Eason groans]

375
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,568
- Nearly there. Almost done.
- [Eason whimpers]

376
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,256
[Eric chuckles]
The man survived at T-rex,

377
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,144
defeated by salve.

378
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,680
[Tyrannosaurus rex roars]

379
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,233
Let's get back inside.

380
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,088
[Tyrannosaurus rex roars]

381
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,456
We need to keep
a low profile for now.

382
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,617
[group panting]

383
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,257
[Peter] Think we're good here.

384
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,409
Yeah.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,377
I hope there's something
awesome in here.

386
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,193
- [Lily chuckles]
- Hey, how about this?

387
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,920
Hm?

388
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,280
- [tense music]
- What do you think this is?

389
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:27,321
[device beeping, hums]

390
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:30,168
Whoa. Cool, man.

391
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,864
It's a smaller version
of the game map.

392
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:33,496
Hey, what are the dots for?

393
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,825
I think the green dots show
our current position.

394
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:39,256
Red dots are likely
the dinosaurs.

395
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:43,416
There's no way we can
lose with this.

396
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:44,440
[Lily laughs]

397
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:46,777
Not really. It doesn't display
the other players.

398
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,080
Antivenom?

399
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:55,128
[scoffs] What's this for?

400
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:57,784
Toxic dinosaur?

401
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:03,256
Ha!

402
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,145
- This.
- [baton crackles]

403
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,456
This is what I'm talking about.

404
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,296
- Nice. That could be fun.
- [baton crackling]

405
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:11,929
We've got to go, quick.

406
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
- [device beeps]
- [Jeremy] Okay.

407
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:21,816
[Eric] So here's my plan.
We just stay here hidden.

408
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,928
[Eason] Yeah, sure beats
running for our lives.

409
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:26,200
- We'll win this for sure.
- [Eric] Shh. Someone's here.

410
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:30,360
[Vivian scoffs] Amateurs.

411
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:33,016
- [Vivian grunts]
- [Eason] Hey!

412
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:34,681
The hell?!

413
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:36,281
Why'd she do that?

414
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:38,457
- 'Cause she's mean.
- What you did...

415
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:42,007
It's a mess.

416
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:43,545
Hey!

417
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,208
Was this your master plan,

418
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:46,297
to hide behind some sticks?

419
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:48,953
Yeah, he was almost eaten
in the first few minutes.

420
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:51,511
What? Wasn't only me.

421
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:56,344
Look, she's hurt,
and no use to us.

422
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,465
We should take her out.

423
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:00,793
She hasn't done anything to us.
She needs help.

424
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:03,096
I get that, but it'd be
one less person

425
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,056
we need to worry about.

426
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,008
If we don't work together,

427
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,281
I don't think anybody's
gonna win this game.

428
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,168
I won't do it.

429
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:12,664
- [Vivian] What are you doing?
- I'm gonna help you.

430
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:14,745
Hold on. She might just
be faking it.

431
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,488
No, I don't think so.

432
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,231
- [Eric sighs]
- Don't you dare.

433
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,800
It's okay.

434
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:26,040
Trust me.

435
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,536
[gentle music]

436
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:33,848
[winces]

437
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,544
I'm going to need your medicine.

438
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:41,881
- But we might need it.
- Hurry.

439
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:55,097
Okay. Before I begin,
could you pull your shirt down?

440
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:58,233
Ju... ju... just a little so I can
see the wound.

441
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,977
If you try to take advantage
of me, you're dead.

442
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:03,511
I won't, I promise.

443
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:09,849
[light jingling]

444
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:15,096
It feels so real.

445
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,945
Trust me, I know.

446
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:28,921
So how did someone so tough
get hurt so bad?

447
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:31,737
I was careless.

448
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,617
It didn't take long for people
to turn on each other.

449
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:40,185
I'm Vivian.

450
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,224
I'm Eric.

451
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,217
His name's Eason.

452
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:46,745
[chuckles]

453
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:52,024
Okay.

454
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:55,320
All done.

455
00:23:57,721 --> 00:23:58,681
Thank you.

456
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:00,281
No problem.

457
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,368
Hey, is this a dating app
or a game?

458
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,609
[upbeat music]

459
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,017
Whatever, dude.

469
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:06,937
Better give that back.

470
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm sorry! Sorry.

471
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:10,681

472
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:14,296

Where's she going?

488
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:32,792
I knew it was a mistake
to trust her.

489
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,104
She just left us here.

Don't just sit there! Run!

Wait, wait. We're friendly.

- Let me see.

540
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:45,817
Pterodactyl got him.

541
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:47,576
[Lily chuckles]

542
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:53,976
That building is too big for there
not to be something useful in it.

543
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:55,417
Let's go.

544
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:01,656
[pterodactyls screeching]

545
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,320
[door rumbling]

546
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,584
- Hey, hey!
- [banging]

547
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,056
- [Eric] Open the door!
- [Eason] Open up!

548
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,585
I open this door for you,
and we all die!

549
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:20,441
- Asshole.
- [Eason] Come on.

550
00:29:26,616 --> 00:29:28,472
[raptor calling]

551
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:37,817
Hey! Hey!

552
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,120
Why didn't you let us in?!

553
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,880
It's everyone for themselves,
you know that!

554
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,248
[window crashing]

555
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:45,784
- [all gasping]
- [raptor growls]

556
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:47,192
[door rumbling]

557
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,720
[raptor snarls, screeches]

558
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:51,161
[intense music]

559
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:53,944
[raptor snarling]

560
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,921
[man panting]

561
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:02,136
[raptor snarls, screeches]

562
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,960
[Eric yelps]

563
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,088
[raptor growling]

564
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,720
[raptor screeches]

565
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:13,656
[raptor snarling]

566
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:18,520
[raptor screeches]

567
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:21,336
- All right, let's go!
- [raptors growling]

568
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:23,288
[man screaming]

569
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,897
[raptor chomps]

570
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,809
[pterodactyls screeching]

571
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,601
[raptor calls]

572
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:31,577
[raptor screeches]

573
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:33,880
This is way more stressful
than I expected.

574
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,321
- [raptor calls]
- We're trapped.

575
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,848
Any idea how to get
out of this one?

576
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,832
[Eric panting]

577
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:41,400
[raptor screeches]

578
00:30:42,616 --> 00:30:43,768
- Hey.
- [Eric] Huh?

579
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,721
What are you here for?

580
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,793
[Eric sighs]
I attend a local university.

581
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:51,128
- [Eason] Uh-huh.
- Masters in paleontology.

582
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,880
It was going pretty well,

583
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,048
but a year ago,
my mother became very ill.

584
00:30:57,912 --> 00:30:59,161
The medical bills
are adding up.

585
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:03,576
On top of the tuition,
we just can't afford it.

586
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:06,520
Might have to drop out
and take care of her.

587
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:10,296
[sighs] I see. So this
competition is your best shot.

588
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,448
It is.

589
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,176
The prize money could
go a long way

590
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,545
in paying for her procedures

591
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:17,561
and giving me a chance
to stay here.

592
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,960
[raptor snarls, screeches]

593
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:21,720
- [Eric] And you?
- Me?

594
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:26,680
[sighs] My life isn't
what you'd call fulfilling.

595
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:27,864
Wanted some fun.

596
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:30,488
I'm a math teacher,
and I hate math.

597
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:32,857
- Math?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

598
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,328
That sounds awful.

599
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,216
- Right?
- [Eric laughs]

600
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,400
[raptor screeches]

601
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:40,440
I tried my best for my students,

602
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:44,248
but it just wasn't enough.

603
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,425
They still don't like me.

604
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:49,688
This test is being
streamed online,

605
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,472
so let's win the prize
to show them...

606
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,440
that they have a cool teacher.

607
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:57,688
[chuckles]

608
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:58,681
[Eason] Deal.

609
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:01,528
[raptor screeches]

610
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,545
[raptor calls]

611
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:05,080
[both laughing]

612
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,353
- [Eason groaning]
- [Eric yelps]

613
00:32:07,545 --> 00:32:10,104
- [pterodactyl screeching]
- [Eason groaning]

614
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,128
[intense music]

615
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:13,560
[Eric] Eason!

616
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,568
[Eason screaming]

617
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,768
- [glass shatters]
- [pterodactyl screeching]

618
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,537
No key.

619
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,257
- What about the machine gun?
- Help me out.

620
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,560
- Uh-huh.
- [machine gun rattling]

621
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:40,121
[sighs] It's not moving.

622
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:41,560
[sighs]

623
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:43,640
You guys know how to
hot wire a car?

624
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,424
Do I look like I know how to?
This isn't a movie.

625
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:49,176
[raptor growls]

626
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:51,736
[Eric whimpering]

627
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,944
[tense music]

628
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,840
[raptor screeches]

629
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:00,056
Oh, yeah. That's right.

630
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:02,552
The knife.

631
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:09,336
[raptor screeches]

632
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,247
- [knife rasps]
- [Eric grunts]

633
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,785
[dramatic music]

634
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:15,705
[Eric yelps]

635
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:16,984
- [raptor growls]
- [knife thuds]

636
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:19,481
[upbeat music]

637
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:51,929
[sighs]

638
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,560
[bag thuds]

639
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,344
[sighs]

640
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,336
[sighs]

641
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,336
[ominous music]

642
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,617
[raptor snarling]

643
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:28,951
[raptor screeches]

644
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,257
- [rifle fires]
- [raptor chirps]

645
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:33,529
- [rifle fires]
- [Lily gasps]

646
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:35,257
I think that was a gunshot.

647
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,249
Let's go.

648
00:34:39,736 --> 00:34:41,080
[raptor snarls]

649
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,456
[raptor screeches]

650
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:43,865
Come on, you son of a bitch!

651
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:45,336
[raptor snarls]

652
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,553
- [raptor growls]
- [rifle fires]

653
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,577
[man grunts]

654
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,104
[water splashes]

655
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:52,120
Someone has a gun,
and I want it.

656
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:53,241
They're not just gonna
give it to you.

657
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,776
I know that, idiot.
Unlike you two, I have a plan.

658
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,921
I asked you to join me because
you're supposed to be the best,

659
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:02,744
so less talk, more show.

660
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:04,889
[Peter scoffs]

661
00:35:19,032 --> 00:35:20,024
I think he's alone.

662
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,680
- [baton crackling]
- Wait, he's still armed.

663
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:24,664
Hey, I got this.

664
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:27,607
[Lily sighs]

665
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:29,209
[Lily panting]

666
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:30,456
Don't shoot!

667
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:32,407
I'm unarmed.

668
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,456
- [upbeat music]
- [man grunts]

669
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:38,489
Slowly.

670
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,064
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

671
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:49,720
I was with another player,
but a raptor killed him,

672
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,607
and I ran this way as
fast as I could.

673
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,528
Have you killed anything
with that big gun?

674
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,247
[man chuckles]

675
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:02,584
Yeah, I just got three raptors.

676
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:04,024
[Lily chuckles]

677
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:05,144
[man chuckles]

678
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:07,480
It's so big.

679
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,776
- [man chuckles]
- You're so strong.

680
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:12,345
[chuckles] It's nothing.

681
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:13,720
[both chuckling]

682
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:17,496
- [baton crackling]
- [man groaning]

683
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:19,447
Woopsie! [chuckles]

684
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,769
Hey, I think he was
shocked to see me.

685
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,144
- [Jeremy chuckles]
- Yeah. [chuckles]

686
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:26,265
Tie him up.

687
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,449
[man groaning]

688
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,273
Let's go, big boy.

689
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:30,649
- [Jeremy grunts]
- [man groaning]

690
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:31,960
[dramatic music]

691
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:33,081
[Eddie grunting]

692
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:34,937
- [raptor snarls]
- Help!

693
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:36,857
[raptor screeches]

694
00:36:36,888 --> 00:36:38,647
[Eddie grunting]

695
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,897

[raptor snarls]

699
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,256
[Eddie groans]

700
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:48,441
Help me!

701
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:50,489
[Alex] Hey!

702
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,464
- [knife rasps]
- [raptor hisses]

703
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,831
[raptor snarls]

704
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:57,369
- [raptor growls]
- [knife rasps]

705
00:36:58,872 --> 00:36:59,800
- [knife rasps]

706
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,833
[chuckles]

707
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:09,976
[gasps]

708
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,521
Come on.

709
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:15,960
I can't trust you.

710
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:24,376
Why? I could've walked away
and let that raptor eat you.

711
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:27,129
[chuckles]

712
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:29,496
Hm?

713
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:33,657
[scoffs] Okay, fine.

714
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,377
Bye.

715
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:53,848
[ominous music]

716
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,753
- [Jeremy grunting]
- [man groaning]

717
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:03,064
Seriously?

718
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,193
- Come on, guys!
- [Jeremy] Bye.

719
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,751
You can't leave me
here like this.

720
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:11,768
- Hey!
- Hm?

721
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:15,608
Look, I don't even want the gun.
You can have it.

722
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,657
Just please let me go!

723
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:21,240
Sorry, can't do that.

724
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,160
Oh, by the way,

725
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:26,297
I've seen bigger. Hm.

726
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:31,864
Help!

727
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,664
- [man in distance] Somebody help!
- Wait. Did you hear something?

728
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:39,129
- No.
- [man in distance] Help!

729
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,632
You heard it that time.

730
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:41,977
Yeah, I did.

731
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:43,897
- [man] Hey, help me!
- That way!

732
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,016
[man] Anyone!

733
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,696
Hey, someone's coming.

734
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:55,193
[ominous music]

735
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:57,337
[man groaning]

736
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,097
[screams]

737
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,665
[groaning]

738
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:03,129
Hey. Hey, over here.

739
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,431
Could you guys help me? Please.

740
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,833
- [woman] What do you think?
- [sighs] I don't know.

741
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,361
How did you manage to
get yourself in this position?

742
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,377
I was tricked by three assholes.

743
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:15,384
They took my rifle.
Would you guys just get me outta here

744
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,016
so I can go kill them?

745
00:39:17,048 --> 00:39:18,264
- He's pissed.
- [panting]

746
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:19,928
Might come in useful.

747
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:21,337
Yeah. All right.

748
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:22,905
Just hold on.

749
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,240
- [rifle fires]
- [man groans]

750
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,480

752
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:32,056
[chuckles]

753
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:33,592
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

754
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,288
- [Lily chuckles]
- Now we're playing.

755
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,281
I like it.

756
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:39,032
[man over PA]
<i>10 players remaining.</i>

757
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:41,945
<i>New equipment has been
delivered to the starting area.</i>

758
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:43,192
Everyone will be
headed that way.

759
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:45,464
Well, then, let's go back.

760
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:46,456
[rifle clicks]

761
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,304
[man groaning]

762
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:50,968
- What the hell?
- [headset clatters]

763
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:53,496
[ominous music]

764
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:56,793
- [dart gun fires]
- [Eddie gasps]

765
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,809
- Poison.
- [Eddie gasps]

766
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,304
Come on, that was so close.

767
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,065
Wait, did you seriously
catch that dart?

768
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,041
- Wait right here.
- Hm.

769
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,841
[gun clicking]

770
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:17,561
Hey, hey, man, I'm sorry!

771
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:19,864
Hold on!
It's just a game, dude!

772
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,913
[man panting]

773
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:23,160
Hey! Stop!

774
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:24,856
Keep away.

775
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,392
You crazy?!

776
00:40:27,288 --> 00:40:29,048
Why'd you shoot it at a kid for?

777
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:30,872
What's your problem, man?

778
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,504
You are, you spineless coward.

779
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,384
Picking on those who are
too weak to fight back.

780
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:38,233
- [dart gun fires]
- [dart thuds]

781
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:42,360
Seriously?

782
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,368
[chuckles]

783
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,512
How about a taste of
your own medicine?

784
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,617
- [dart clangs]
- [man yelps]

785
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:52,056
Whoa.

786
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:56,088
- All right.
- [gun thuds]

787
00:40:57,048 --> 00:40:58,137
Come on, man.

788
00:40:58,168 --> 00:40:59,257
- [kick thuds]
- [man groans]

789
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:00,856
- [hand chops]
- [man groans]

790
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,104
[neck cracks]

791
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:15,288
You take away consequences,

792
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,008
and people show their
true colors.

793
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:31,768
- [Alex chuckles]
- Where is he?

794
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,328
I killed him.

795
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:36,760
[gentle music]

796
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:38,328
I had no choice.

797
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,176
You saved my life.

798
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:43,257
Yeah, of course.

799
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,752
That's the second time
I saved you.

800
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,416
Let's not make it a habit, okay?

801
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,552
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

802
00:41:51,736 --> 00:41:52,728
Now do you trust me?

803
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:55,768
Okay.

804
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,336
Okay.

805
00:41:58,137 --> 00:41:59,577
Let's get the new supplies.
Come on.

806
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:02,424
Don't fall behind.

807
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:05,208
- [notification chimes]
- [interface buzzing]

808
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:11,896
That way.

809
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,816
Give me it.

810
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,328
How come no one has
shown up yet?

811
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:32,825
I don't like waiting.

812
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:34,968
We don't know how many
players are left.

813
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,160
Don't worry, whoever's
still alive will show up.

814
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:54,232
[Alex] Hey, why did you sign up
for this anyway?

815
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:58,008
[Eddie] Hm? Russell's a talented
game designer.

816
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:02,520
Most of my classmates
love his games.

817
00:43:02,776 --> 00:43:05,528
We all wanted to be chosen
to test "Dinosaur World."

818
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,096
You don't know how envious
my classmates are

819
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:08,312
that I got picked.

820
00:43:09,305 --> 00:43:11,225
So I tried to stay hidden.

821
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,296
I know I probably
won't win the prize,

822
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:17,241
but I didn't want to get
killed too soon.

823
00:43:17,272 --> 00:43:19,448
I have a son about
the same age as you.

824
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,848
He really loves the games
Russell makes too.

825
00:43:22,424 --> 00:43:24,056
What do you do in
the real world?

826
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:25,592
You don't look like a gamer.

827
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:27,736
I'm a bodyguard for
the rich and powerful.

828
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,392
My job usually keeps me
away from home.

829
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:32,824
I don't get to see
my son very much.

830
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,216
My son was looking
forward to this game,

831
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:37,816
so I signed up to surprise him.

832
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,608
I thought that if I won
the competition,

833
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,656
maybe I'd be a little bit
closer to him.

834
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,832
I didn't expect to be chosen.

835
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:45,976
When the game is over,
we'll have a lot to talk about.

836
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,337
Hopefully, he'll be proud of me,
you know?

837
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,160
I would be proud if
you were my dad.

838
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,048
[Alex chuckles]

839
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,000
Let's team up. Come on.

840
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:56,024
[Eddie sighs]

841
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:05,176
- [shoulders thudding]
- [both groaning]

842
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,537
[sighs]
Where were you?

843
00:44:09,368 --> 00:44:10,680
I got lost.

844
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:12,248
Huh.

845
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,217
- [ground rumbling]
- Huh?

846
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,968
What's going on?

847
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,561
- Feels like an earthquake.
- [tree cracking]

848
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,681
Let's go.

849
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:23,800

Whoa. See that?

856
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:52,952
Man, they thought of everything.

857

- [man grunting]

860

Quick. Shoot him.

861
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:12,760
Wait. Something's chasing him.

862
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,552

Oh, damn!

Shh.

872
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:42,936
One less to worry about.
Can't be many more. [chuckles]

873

[raptor screeches]

874
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:01,368
We're not the only ones here.

875
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,152
This doesn't feel right.

There.

880
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,288
They're camping the supplies,

881
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:25,208
picking off those
who come along.

[Eddie groans]

900
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,840
Eddie!

901
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:25,976
Hang on. [grunting]

902
00:47:27,608 --> 00:47:29,977
[music continues]

903
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:31,736
[Peter chuckles]

904
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,480
[sighs] Still too dangerous.
Just a bit longer.

905
00:47:40,344 --> 00:47:42,521
They ran after them.
Now's a good time to get a bag.

906
00:47:42,553 --> 00:47:43,896
- Wait.
- [Vivian grunts]

907
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:44,984
Okay, but let's be quick.

908
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:45,976
Hurry!

909
00:47:56,728 --> 00:47:58,296
Eddie, hold on.

910
00:47:59,288 --> 00:48:00,472
We have to win, remember?

911
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:02,617
Just leave me.

912
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:06,200
Why did you do that?
You could've got away.

913
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,505
You saved my life twice.

914
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:10,136
I still owe you one.

915
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:12,888
You're a good kid.

916
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:14,584
You're gonna be all right.

917
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,720
Besides, if you
still owe me one,

918
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,889
you have to hang on for me,
okay?

919
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:23,480
Go. They'll be here any moment.

920
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:27,256
[Eddie groans]

921
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:29,016
This is painful.

922
00:48:29,048 --> 00:48:30,008
[Eddie groans]

923
00:48:32,856 --> 00:48:35,321
[gentle music]

924
00:48:40,216 --> 00:48:42,360
Hey. Hey!

925
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:45,753
You're gonna wake up
safe and sound.

926
00:48:48,536 --> 00:48:52,280
Kid, I'll make them pay for
what they did to you.

927
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,096
[Alex grunts]

928
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:11,769
[monitor whirring]

929
00:49:16,729 --> 00:49:18,007
Weird.

930
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:19,576
[Lily] I think he was over here.

931
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,176
Where's the other one?

932
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,600
Poor kid.

933
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:34,841
Better luck next time.

934
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,360
[grunts]

935
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,409
- [sighs]
- [key jingles]

936
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:42,168
It's our lucky day.

937
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,281
- Look at this.
- You found the key.

938
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,968
Now the jeep is ours. Let's go.

939
00:49:48,313 --> 00:49:49,656
[bag zipping]

940
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:54,969
Someone's over there.

941
00:49:56,568 --> 00:49:57,689
[rifle clicks]

942
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,697

- [Eric gasping]

943
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,040
[Vivian gasps]

944
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:04,152
They're here! Run!

945
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,840
- [both panting]
- [dramatic music]

946
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,847
[Jeremy]
I don't think they're armed.

947
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:12,696
It'll be hard to track down
where they went,

948
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:14,169
but they need to die.

949
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:16,440
Lily and I will go after them.

950
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,720
You check the supplies.

951
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:19,608
Okay. I'll check the bags.

952
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,729
Go.

953
00:50:20,761 --> 00:50:23,287
[tense music]

954
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:31,864
[dart rasps]

955
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:42,777
Huh? [groans]

956
00:50:44,697 --> 00:50:45,785

- [kick thuds]

957

958
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:49,304
- [dart thuds]
- [Alex grunts]

959
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,577
Time to pay for what you did.

960
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:55,417
[Jeremy groaning]

961
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:02,041
Help.

962
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:04,985
[both panting]

963
00:51:05,017 --> 00:51:06,391
[Jeremy in distance] Help!

964
00:51:06,424 --> 00:51:07,512
Jeremy.

965
00:51:14,649 --> 00:51:16,473
That guy with the kid we shot.

966
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:17,465
What happened?

967
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:20,887
Poison dart.

968
00:51:22,137 --> 00:51:23,671
- [Jeremy groaning]
- [rifle fires]

969
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:24,856
[Lily groans]

970
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:25,784
Did you get him?

971
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:29,017
- He got away. How's Jeremy?
- It's poison.

972
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:31,865
[coughing]

973
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,327
[laughing]

974
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,184
I threw away the antivenom.

975
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,152
[coughing]

976
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:43,831
[groaning]

977
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,872
He also took the scope.

978
00:51:47,385 --> 00:51:48,217
Damn it!

979
00:51:49,017 --> 00:51:51,097
This guy's tough.
We need to be cautious.

980
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:52,471
What about the other two?!

981
00:51:53,496 --> 00:51:54,873
Gone.

982
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,016
Great. [groans]

983
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:03,257
- [groans] Damn it!
- [headset clatters]

984
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:07,927
[Alex grunts]

985
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,880
[footsteps rustling]

986
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,560
- [suspenseful music]
- [bugs chirping]

987
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,671
- Hey.
- [Eric gasps]

988
00:52:36,376 --> 00:52:37,336
Shh.

989
00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:42,009
I'm not a threat.

990
00:52:43,256 --> 00:52:45,753
I know who's chasing you.
They're chasing after me as well.

991
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:48,247
We saw them shoot that boy.

992
00:52:49,144 --> 00:52:50,297
- Was he your friend?
- Mm.

993
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:55,128
So we should team up and kill
those two and be done with it.

994
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:57,304
Huh? Weren't there three?

995
00:52:57,337 --> 00:53:00,217
[chuckles]
Managed to poison one. Got him!

996
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:01,336
So what should we do now?

997
00:53:06,424 --> 00:53:08,344
It won't be long before
the game's over,

998
00:53:08,376 --> 00:53:10,521
and it doesn't seem like
there are many players left.

999
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:12,856
Those two pose the only threat.

1000
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,457
They're professional gamers.

1001
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:16,024
As if that wasn't bad enough,

1002
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:16,984
they've got a sniper rifle.

1003
00:53:17,016 --> 00:53:19,384
As things are,
we can't compete against that.

1004
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:22,807
The grand prize means nothing.
I don't even want it.

1005
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,409
But I want to make sure

1006
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,551
they don't get
their hands on it either.

1007
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,937
I promised Eddie
that I will avenge him.

1008
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:32,537
Mm-hm.

1009
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:35,769
So let's assess our situation,
come up with a plan.

1010
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,689
Do you have anything in
your bag we can use?

1011
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,127
Oh.

1012
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,193
I have two hand grenades.

1013
00:53:44,887 --> 00:53:46,104
You should take one.

1014
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:51,608
Mm.

1015
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,641
Hey, I got the scope.

1016
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:57,497
I don't need it anymore.
Take it.

1017

- [dramatic music]
- [raptor screeching]

1018
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:06,616

[both panting]

1036
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:52,217
Take it.

1037
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:55,831
[device beeps, hums]

1038
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,241
Something found them.

1039
00:54:58,456 --> 00:55:00,409
Maybe the dinos will
kill them for us.

1040
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,848
We have to make sure.

1041
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,608
They didn't last this long
with only luck.

1042
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,040
- [device beeps, hums]
- All right, let's go.

1043
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:07,416
- Mm-hm.
- Clock's ticking.

00:55:17,337 --> 00:55:18,361
Not bad, you two.

1047
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:20,921
Alex, there's one
more over there!

- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1064
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:57,016
This guy doesn't give up.

1065
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:01,625
Even with a bullet in him,
he nearly took us out.

1066
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:02,968
Are you sure you can kill him?

1067
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:04,120
Yeah.

1068
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:09,880
With those wounds,
he won't be alive much longer.

1069
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,577
[gentle music]

1070
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:16,633
We made a good team.

1071
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:22,233
You have to go. Just leave me.

1072
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:24,600
But we haven't helped
you avenge Eddie.

1073
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:30,873
The longer you stay here,
the more dangerous it becomes.

1074
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,200
Live and fight on.

1075
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:38,584
Run.

1076
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:43,257
I swear, we're not gonna
let them win this game.

1077
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:47,865
[Alex] Survive till the end,

1078

1081
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,105
Don't move!

1082
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:04,088
He's still alive.

You're a lousy shot!

1085
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,888
Your aim was off!

1086
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:10,201
Then prove it!

You two won't stand
a chance against me.

1090
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:21,880
Listen, how about you step out

1091
00:58:23,288 --> 00:58:25,145
and we can talk through
a solution to this?

I've ever seen.

1096
00:59:04,696 --> 00:59:05,752
What about the other two?

1097

You're actually still alive?

1122
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,737
Yeah. Pterodactyl dropped me
in her nest and flew away.

1123
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:54,040
I found some Easter eggs.

1124

Huh. Of course they did.

1138
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,888
And it's got a machine gun.

1139

Then we're as good as dead.

1141
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:39,128

They're like scale-covered

- This is all your fault.
- My fault?!

1293
01:10:17,528 --> 01:10:20,311
It was your idea to hack the
system in the first place! [grunts]

1294

[man] <i>Peter is also banned

Hey, I was thinking
we'd share the prize money,

1307
01:10:53,304 --> 01:10:54,584
but I guess there's no need now.

1308
01:10:54,616 --> 01:10:56,536
I mean, I won't say no
to more money.
