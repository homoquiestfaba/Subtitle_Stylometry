1
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,186
The Mifulu represent
a fascinating example

2
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,096
of failed culture.
The people of the Mifulu

3
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,794
communicated
entirely in rhyme,

4
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,633
although that's actually
less impressive than it sounds,

5
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,266
because their language
only contained one vowel.

6
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,276
Also, if you've
noticed,

7
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,540
the only artifacts
we've been able to unearth

8
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,513
are primitive musical
instruments.

9
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,278
The Mifulus had
plenty of drums,

10
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,285
guitars, harmonicas
and the like,

11
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,311
but no weapons
or tools.

12
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,519
So, in essence,
they had rhythm, they had music,

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,051
but they had no
hammers and spears,

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,064
so they died.

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,033
In any case, this brings us
to the final room of the tour

16
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,695
and my personal
favorite-

17
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,364
The Hall
of Norse Mythology.

18
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,209
This is Odin,

19
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,212
chief divinity of the entire
Norse pantheon--

20
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,214
"The Allfather"
as he's called--

21
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,274
and these paintings depict
some of Odin's many sons.

22
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,377
That is Thor,
God of Thunder,

23
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,388
with his mighty hammer.

24
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,652
And this is Balder,
God of Beauty.

25
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,454
Who's that ugly guy?

26
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,620
Oh, I was just
about to get to him.

27
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,027
That's Loki,
Norse God of Mischief.

28
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,396
He was also known
as "The Trickster."

29
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,402
As the youngest
son of Odin,

30
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,337
Loki was the black sheep
of the Norse mythological family.

31
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,340
His constant
mischievous pranks

32
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,342
were an endless source
of embarrassment

33
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,344
to his father
and his siblings.

34
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,608
He was, in other words,
a bratty little brother.

35
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,209
And Loki's ultimate tool
of mischief was this,

36
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,652
the mask
which he created

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,814
and tossed down to earth
thousands of years ago

38
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,087
to create mayhem among the mortals.
For, according to legend,

39
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,926
the wearer of the mask is imbued
with the powers of Loki himself.

40
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,261
- Is that true?
- No, of course not.

41
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,824
If it were, I'd be
wearing it myself.

42
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,598
No, no, it's textbook
mythical allegory.

43
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,606
Loki represents
the "id,"

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,608
the suppressed parts
of ourselves,

45
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,837
and the mask is the tool
which unleashes the id.

46
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,369
I go into this very topic
in my critically acclaimed book.

47
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,712
Now, of all
the Aesir gods--

48
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,242
excuse me, sir.
Please don't touch the mask display.

49
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,084
Of all the Aesir gods,

50
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,181
Loki was the only one
who could shape shift--

51
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,489
change his form,
even turn himself into a woman.

52
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,462
A woman?! Man alive,
lock up your sons and daughters

53
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,694
around that twisted
piece of fruitcake, hey, Doc?

54
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,361
Well, I guess that's
one way of putting it.

55
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,964
Anyway, Loki brought nothing
but shame to Odin and his ilk.

56
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,373
In fact, Loki was
such an unruly child

57
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,469
that Odin ultimately
locked him up in chains

58
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,207
far beneath the earth.

59
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,444
He did not!

60
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,905
- Good God!
- And don't you forget it!

61
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,684
Apparently, you do not
agree with my theories.

62
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,514
Finally!

63
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,787
- This is a fake!
- Yes, but it's a good fake.

64
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,532
Ow. Sir, that
is museum property.

65
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,164
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me replace it.

66
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,504
What-- what are--
what are you doing?

67
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,840
Perhaps I should inform you
I suffer from vertigo

68
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,006
and I have a lawyer.

69
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,675
Hello?

70
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,386
Where's my body?
Come get me.

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,911
- Yeah. Oh yeah.
- Hold it right there!

72
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,228
I don't like it here.

73
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,472
Thanks for dropping by.

74
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,599
- Dropping?
- Bye.

75
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,041
Where's... my...

76
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,076
mask?!

77
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,103
Who's a happy baby?

78
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,599
Who's a happy baby?

79
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,442
Aw, Clare, he's amazing.
Honey, look at him.

80
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,915
They said he's very
alert for his age.

81
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,850
He's going to be
a genius

82
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,910
just like his brothers
and sisters.

83
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,355
Little Tommy's starting
Junior Mensa next week...

84
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,951
and Clancy just took
his first potty poop.

85
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,018
Oh, look. Honey, he just
took his first poop.

86
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,223
Good poop, Clancy!

87
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,929
Whoa, Captain Underpants,

88
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,438
watch your aim.
He's gonna need those.

89
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,963
- You okay?
- Yup.

90
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,805
Here. Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,679
So, when are you two gonna have
one for yourselves?

92
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,812
Oh...

93
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,387
It's a boy.

94
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,555
And agirl!

95
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,426
- Twins?
- And another boy!

96
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,431
- Girl.
- Boy.

97
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,433
- Girl.
- Boy.

98
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,197
Girl, boy, girl, boy...

99
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,609
Tim!

100
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,306
Whew.

101
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,644
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

102
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,479
That was flat out
embarrassing.

103
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,951
The mere mention
of the word "baby" and your throat

104
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,681
seizes up like
you swallowed Drano.

105
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,484
After seeing those kids,

106
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,582
Drano sounds like
a good option.

107
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,788
- Honey, just think...
- Yeah?

108
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,095
if we have a baby, you'll have someone
you can play video games with.

109
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,623
Mm-hmm.

110
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,634
- Hey!
- You'll have someone you can relate to.

111
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,938
Okay, honey, look.
I know you're upset, okay?

112
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,672
- But can I ask you one question?
- What?

113
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,277
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

114
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,045
Tim, stop it.
I mean it.

115
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,518
Look, babe,
who's a turkey?

116
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,521
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk!

117
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,456
- I'm serious!
- Who's a rabid dog?

118
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,685
Ow!

119
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,463
- Who's Hannibal the Cannibal?
- Stop it.

120
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,867
Jeez, babe.

121
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,700
Okay, I'm driving--
driving-- driving here!

122
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,242
- Ugh.
- Honey, slow down.

123
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,681
You know I can't run and apologize
at the same time.

124
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,982
Come on, Tonya. I'm not saying
I don't want to have a baby.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,580
I'm just saying I don't want to have
a baby right now.

126
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,059
So why not?
Why not now?

127
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,119
- Because.
- Ugh.

128
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,130
Wha-- babe!

129
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,928
Tonya!
Ton-ton--

130
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,034
Hey, Otis.

131
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,665
You got room
in your doghouse?

132
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,077
Here you go.
Here you go. Yeah!

133
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,983
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

134
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,987
Up.

135
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,184
You're good, aren't you?
Now, get in the hole.

136
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,219
Tretiak's in the net
for the Soviets.

137
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,288
Paul Henderson's out
of the penalty box.

138
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,732
He's on the break!
he shoots!

139
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,135
Oh, what a save!

140
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,232
What a comeback!
Oh! Free beef jerky for everybody!

141
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,267
And the ice is being pelted
with Kibbles 'n Bits.

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,148
What's this?

143
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:47,209
Now, Otis, how many
times have I told you?

144
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,780
If you're gonna steal something,
steal something with a little value.

145
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,621
That's what we're looking for.
Get up here, come on.

146
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,718
Come here.

147
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,554
Thanks, pal.
Your kissing is getting a lot better.

148
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,528
You don't want a baby
right now, do you?

149
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,133
He said it.

150
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,167
Mmm.

151
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,710
LOKl!

152
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,524
Dad?

153
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,291
I-I mean,
Oh, masterful Odin, is that you?

154
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,828
Have you found
your mask, Loki?

155
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,808
I found a mask,
but as it turns out,

156
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,573
- it was a fake.
- Why are you relaxing on this beach?

157
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,172
I'm just taking a few
moments reprieve from my--

158
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,149
Nonsense!
That mask

159
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,913
has caused enough mischief
and malfeasance among the mortals.

160
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,717
I curse the day
you created that thing.

161
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,156
Why don't you just use
that all-seeing eye of yours

162
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,921
- and tell me where it is?
- This is your mess

163
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,588
and you will clean it up!

164
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,063
You're a god!
Now start acting like one!

165
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,726
Now, find that mask

166
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:12,363
before I open up a can
of lightning on you!

167
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,938
Do you need anything
while I'm out?

168
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,175
I'm just gonna go make
a baby with the neighbor.

169
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,945
- Honey, come here.
- What?

170
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,977
Look! Look at all
this stuff.

171
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,791
I've been trying to do
this for 10 years

172
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,056
of my life, creating
these shows and--

173
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,622
I just need more time.

174
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,396
Okay, I get it, okay?

175
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,405
You want your own show,

176
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,669
and I want you
to have your own show.

177
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,938
You're so good!

178
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,036
But I also...

179
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,414
really, really
wanna have a baby.

180
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,152
So, what do we do?

181
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,658
I want our child
to be proud of us,

182
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,660
both of us.

183
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,822
And if somebody asks that child,
"Hey, what does your mommy do?"

184
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,061
He's gonna say, "Oh, she's the managing
director of Apt Apparel."

185
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,593
They'll say, "Cool." When they say,
"What does your daddy do?"

186
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,266
They'll say,
"He's a-- he's a--"

187
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,937
Hey, boys and girls.
I'm Torpedo Tortoise!

188
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,503
¢Ü Here at Animagine,
your dreams come true ¢Ü

189
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,313
¢Ü There's so much fun here
for me and you ¢Ü

190
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,411
¢Ü Animagine inthe morning,
Animagineatnight¢Ü

191
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,684
¢Ü If watching cartoons
is wrong ¢Ü

192
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,191
¢Ü I don't want
to be right! ¢Ü

193
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,385
And here's one for you.

194
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,890
Halloween party's
tomorrow night, homes.

195
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,299
- Got a costume?
- No.

196
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,668
Hey, maybe you could
go as a turtle.

197
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,333
Thanks, Chad.

198
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,666
I can't believe Chad
got promoted again.

199
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,481
When the executives look at me,
all they see is a tortoise.

200
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,883
Hey man, you want things
to change, you gotta make 'em change.

201
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,150
- You ever pitch to the top man himself?
- Daniel Moss? Hell no.

202
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,157
Well, then it's time
to man up, my road dog,

203
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,989
because there he is.

204
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,326
Oh my God.
He never eats lunch down here.

205
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,093
He's too busy being
an animation god!

206
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,259
Then it's fate, man.
You got to go over there

207
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,929
and say, "Yo, I am
Tim Avery and I've been slugging away

208
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,631
in this costume
for six months now

209
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,163
and I got an idea
for a show and you need to hear it."

210
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,836
Be aggressive, man.
If a bug bites you, bite him back!

211
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,573
Oh, you mean like you
have with Sylvia?

212
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,080
Shut up.

213
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,980
You know,
maybe I should.

214
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,542
- Should what?
- Just walk up to Daniel.

215
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,986
- I mean, he's just a guy, right?
- Right.

216
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,082
- What do I have to lose?
- You got nothing to lose, man!

217
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,593
- I'm gonna do it.
- Are you crazy?

218
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,731
Hey, Torpedo Tortoise.

219
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,765
Hi.

220
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,341
Something I can
do for you?

221
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,370
Uhm...

222
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,110
actually, yes.
Yes, you can.

223
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:17,612
Um, see I've been
in the turtle suit for a while now,

224
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,453
but, uh, I'm
a trained animator.

225
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,459
I went to school
and everything,

226
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,961
and, uhm, I got an idea
for a show that, uh,

227
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,793
you gotta hear.

228
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,629
Cool.
Lay it on me.

229
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,760
Now?

230
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,771
So what did he say?

231
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,433
That my ideas lacked spark,
but the door was always open.

232
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,271
Well, that's
a good thing.

233
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,769
No. It's always open so he can push
guys like me out of it.

234
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,412
Come on, Otis.

235
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,786
Otis. Come on.

236
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,121
Come on, boy.
Come on, Otis.

237
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,989
Thank you, Otis.

238
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,517
You're so sweet
and thoughtful.

239
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,984
Which is why you'd make
such a great dad.

240
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,218
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

241
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,228
Well, I was gonna go
as a werewolf victim,

242
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,196
but Otis ruined my mask.

243
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,359
Well, honey, you know,
we've got so much stuff around here.

244
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,801
I don't know, just--
wear that thing.

245
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,497
This?

246
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,167
I can't go as this.

247
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,574
Everyone at Animagine always goes
all out with their costumes.

248
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,341
This is the crappiest
piece of crap in Craptown.

249
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,440
Be a lot less crappy
if you went with me, though.

250
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,543
I know, but I can't.
I gotta finish the Orion brochure.

251
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,020
- You know what?
- Hmm?

252
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,047
Go to the party...

253
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,193
have fun,

254
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,195
and when you get home,

255
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,857
you can tell me
all about it.

256
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,541
So lame.

257
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,647
Whoa!
What the...?

258
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,107
Don't you just
love Halloween?

259
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,372
Whoa!

260
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,811
Trick or treat.

261
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,474
Hardy-har.
Let me see your work lD, please.

262
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,479
- lD?
- No lD, no party.

263
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,013
Where did the wife
put that invitation?

264
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,262
ID, not lV.

265
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,595
Excuse me.
My bad.

266
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,769
Maybe I left it in
my other pants.

267
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,470
- Crazy!
- Okay.

268
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,968
Here's your drink.

269
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,512
This party
is embarrassing.

270
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,522
Can't we stir
things up a little?

271
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,956
- I'm on it.
- Go get 'em.

272
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,366
Who's that green guy?

273
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,030
You'd better cover up,
young lady.

274
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,663
You might catch
a chest cold.

275
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,697
Ah.

276
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,103
What am I thinking?

277
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,115
Whoa! Oh!

278
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,777
Hey!
Oh!

279
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,809
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Ah.

280
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,889
- Jorge.
- Sylvia.

281
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,788
Thank you, God.

282
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:51,194
- ¢Ü You're just too good to be true. ¢Ü
- Let's go.

283
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,222
¢Ü I can't take my
eyes off of you. ¢Ü

284
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,995
Boo! Boo!

285
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,559
Now hold on.
Where is everybody going?

286
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,664
Whoo! All right.
All right!

287
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,733
- Boo! Lame!
- Whoo-hoo!

288
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,643
- ¢Ü Yeah, Fringe City in the house! ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Work it! ¢Ü

289
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,842
- ¢Ü What, what, what ¢Ü
- ¢Ü This is the part where you dance ¢Ü

290
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,579
- ¢Ü This is the part where you boogie ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Ooh, ooh, ooh ¢Ü

291
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,179
- ¢Ü This is the part where you dance ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Uh, uh, uh, uh ¢Ü

292
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,019
¢Ü Shake your booty,
shake your cans like this ¢Ü

293
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,786
¢Ü Shake your pants,
shake-a shake-a ¢Ü

294
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,021
¢Ü Shake your pants like this,
shake your pants ¢Ü

295
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,029
¢Ü Uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh ¢Ü

296
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,860
¢Ü Ladies,
let me hear you ¢Ü

297
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,459
¢Ü You're just too good
to be true, yeah, good to be true ¢Ü

298
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,901
¢Ü Can't take my eyes off of you,
I love you, baby ¢Ü

299
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,905
¢Ü You feel like heaven
to touch, mm-hmm ¢Ü

300
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,907
¢Ü I wanna hold you
so much, yeah, yeah ¢Ü

301
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,536
¢Ü At long last, love has arrived,
I thank God I'm alive ¢Ü

302
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,547
¢Ü You're too good to be true,
can't take my eyes ¢Ü

303
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,641
- ¢Ü Can't take my eyes off of you, yo ¢Ü
- ¢Ü What ¢Ü

304
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,951
¢Ü Pardon the way
that I stare ¢Ü

305
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,220
¢Ü No one else
who can compare ¢Ü

306
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,454
¢Ü The sight of you
leaves me weak ¢Ü

307
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,396
¢Ü There are no words
left to speak ¢Ü

308
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,399
¢Ü So if you feel
like I feel ¢Ü

309
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,731
¢Ü Please let me know
that it's real ¢Ü

310
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,101
¢Ü You're just too good
to be true ¢Ü

311
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,106
¢Ü Can't take my eyes
off of you. ¢Ü

312
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,079
¢Ü I love you, baby. ¢Ü

313
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,774
- Yee-haw!
- ¢Ü Don't bring me down ¢Ü

314
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,249
¢Ü I pray, oh pretty baby... ¢Ü

315
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,912
- All right!
- ¢Ü Now that I found you ¢Ü

316
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,320
¢Ü Stay and let me
love you ¢Ü

317
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,790
¢Ü Baby, let me
love you ¢Ü

318
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,793
¢Ü You're just
too good to be true ¢Ü

319
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,590
¢Ü Can't take my eyes
off you ¢Ü

320
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:34,360
¢Ü You feel like heaven to touch,
I wanna hold you so much ¢Ü

321
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,165
¢Ü Now at last long,
love has arrived ¢Ü

322
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,728
¢Ü I thank the Lord I'm alive,
you're too good to be true ¢Ü

323
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,297
¢Ü I can't stop watching you,
can't take my eyes off you ¢Ü

324
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,742
¢Ü Too... good...
to... be... ¢Ü

325
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,651
¢Ü I love you, baby,
hands in the air ¢Ü

326
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,882
¢Ü And if it's quite all right,
I need you, baby ¢Ü

327
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,788
¢Ü Even though you
don't care ¢Ü

328
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,952
¢Ü To warm those lonely nights
I love you, baby¢Ü

329
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,360
¢Ü Allthe ladiesonthe left¢Ü

330
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,364
¢Ü Trust in me
when I say ¢Ü

331
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,764
¢Ü Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it, shake it ¢Ü

332
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,530
- ¢Ü Oh pretty baby ¢Ü
- ¢Ü All the fellas on the right ¢Ü

333
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,367
¢Ü Don't bring me down,
I pray ¢Ü

334
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,339
- ¢Ü Oh, pretty baby ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Getting freaky on the side ¢Ü

335
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,638
¢Ü Now that
I found you, stay ¢Ü

336
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,611
¢Ü And let me
love you, baby. ¢Ü

337
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,877
- Jump, jump, jump, jump.
- ¢Ü Let me love you ¢Ü

338
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,981
¢Ü This is the part
where you boogie ¢Ü

339
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,011
¢Ü This is the part
where you dance! ¢Ü

340
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,729
Honey, I'm home.

341
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,370
- Babe, what's gotten into you?
- Let's find out.

342
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,142
That was off the chain
last night, guru.

343
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,912
You were a whirling dervish
of craziness, homes.

344
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,545
Hey, um, did you--
did you use holograms

345
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,748
for-- for all that--
that stuff?

346
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,451
Whoa, Avery, I didn't know
you had it in you, man!

347
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,653
Yeah, well,
me neither.

348
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,856
- Tim Avery?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,127
Daniel Moss would
like to see you in his office.

350
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,157
Do you have
a minute?

351
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,979
This has potential.

352
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,711
Come here.
Come here.

353
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,959
This has that spark
I was looking for.

354
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,964
I mean, not to be
crass about it,

355
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:23,832
but this guy-- this could be
a franchise character.

356
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,529
How'd you come up
with this?

357
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,906
M-my dog brought
it to me.

358
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,470
Oh, yeah. If we knew
where the great ones came from,

359
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,607
we'd go there
every day, right?

360
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,708
Yeah.

361
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,086
Listen,

362
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,919
I think we could
do something with this.

363
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:49,290
How would you
like to move up to the second floor?

364
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,988
Where is it?
Where is it?

365
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,198
Otis! You know that mask
you were chewing on,

366
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,208
the wooden one?
Where is it, boy?

367
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,770
Find it and I'll take
you to see Venus--

368
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,373
you know, that cute little Jack Russell
you're always trying to jump?

369
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,350
Yes, I think you guys
would make a good couple.

370
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,353
I don't know.
I don't speak Doberman.

371
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,446
Babe!
I got incredible news!

372
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,889
Really?
I think I do too!

373
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,893
- Really? What?
- Um, you go.

374
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,519
- No, you go.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

375
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,154
- Babe, let me go.
- Okay, go.

376
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,064
Guess who got moved up
to the second floor?

377
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh God, that is so great!
I am so proud of you.

378
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,167
- Oh, then it was meant to be.
- What's meant to be? What's your news?

379
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,439
I've been feeling
really funky all day

380
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,538
- and you're not gonna believe this.
- I'm not gonna believe what?

381
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,913
- Tell me! What? What?
- Okay. I think I might be...

382
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,453
- Pregnant.
- Yes!

383
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,186
Oh, but how can that be, 'cause we--
that can't be-- we just--

384
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,559
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

385
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,121
Where's there a trashcan?
Where's there a trashcan?

386
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,075
- Is that normal?
- No.

387
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,512
And what's worse,
it's not covered by insurance.

388
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,610
¢Ü Baby face ¢Ü

389
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,382
¢Ü You've got
the cutest little ¢Ü

390
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,514
- ¢Ü Baby face. ¢Ü
- Mm-hmm!

391
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,117
- He goes here, he comes running...
- ¢Ü There's not another one ¢Ü

392
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,720
- ¢Ü Could take your place ¢Ü
-...and bam, in his face.

393
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,390
¢Ü Baby face ¢Ü

394
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,229
- ¢Ü My poor heart is jumpin'. ¢Ü
- Honey, that's our baby!

395
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,963
¢Ü You sure have
started something. ¢Ü

396
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,268
¢Ü Ah, freak out! ¢Ü

397
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,673
¢Ü When I play the maracas
I go chic-chicky-boom ¢Ü

398
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,939
¢Ü Chic-chicky-boom ¢Ü

399
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,572
¢Ü Baby face ¢Ü

400
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,582
¢Ü I'm up in heaven ¢Ü

401
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,244
- ¢Ü When I'm in your fond embrace. ¢Ü
- Hello, in there.

402
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,220
- Wow.
- What?

403
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,779
- l-I think my water just broke.
- ¢Ü I didn't need a shove ¢Ü

404
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,723
- ¢Ü 'Cause I just fell in love... ¢Ü
- Really?

405
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,058
- It's a boy.
- ¢Ü With your pretty baby ¢Ü

406
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,063
¢Ü Pretty baby ¢Ü

407
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:10,431
¢Ü Face! ¢Ü

408
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,459
Oh, Alvey.

409
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,997
Say hello to your son.

410
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,135
Uh, hello there, son.

411
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,147
I've been waiting
to meet you

412
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,978
for nine months now.

413
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,653
Whoa. He's got
a killer grip.

414
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,157
But Dad counteracts
with his Pinky of Doom.

415
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,391
Hey, do you know
who I am?

416
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,126
I'm your dad.

417
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,661
Loki!

418
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,011
There was a baby

419
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,707
born of the mask!

420
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,649
Damn!
Where's my mask?!

421
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,992
Sir, y-you're gonna
have to pay for that.

422
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,464
The advertisement
said they were authentic!

423
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,473
They are authentic.

424
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,840
They're authentic Pakistani
Norse Mythology masks.

425
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,213
Okay.
Now let me think.

426
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,776
What should
I turn him into?

427
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:39,620
Loki!

428
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,391
Dad?

429
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,953
Fool!

430
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,692
What in Helveti were you
about to do to this shopkeep?

431
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,893
- Nothing, I was just--
- Fool!

432
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,902
Don't you dare
lie to me.

433
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,530
You know, Thor never gave me
this kind of trouble.

434
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,234
Okay, here we go again
with the Thor crap.

435
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,039
Thor, Thor, Thor.
You know, father, I'm not like Thor.

436
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,103
I'm never gonna
be like Thor.

437
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,047
I just wish that--
can't you just

438
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,346
Iove me for who I am

439
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,716
and not for who I'm not?

440
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,551
No! I want you to be
more like Thor!

441
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,557
Now, I've wasted
enough time here.

442
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,559
I felt a tremor.

443
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,027
A child has been
born of the mask!

444
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,327
Wow. A baby's born
of the mask,

445
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,425
so that sort of makes me
kind of like a dad, huh?

446
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,732
- Find it!
- The baby or the mask?

447
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,738
Find the baby

448
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,104
and you will
find the mask.

449
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,132
Right.

450
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,882
Tonya, have you
seen Otis?

451
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,907
He's in his
new doghouse!

452
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,087
Who's a happy baby?

453
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,816
Who's a happy baby?

454
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,015
Let's blow up
another one.

455
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,458
You like these, huh?
They're pretty!

456
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,464
Honey, honey, honey,
just a second ago,

457
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,490
he was counting the balloons.
He held up five fingers.

458
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,502
That's great, hon.
I gotta go.

459
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,266
Daniel brought in Chad
to backstab me-- oh, I mean help me--

460
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,604
and I gotta get to work
before he helps me out of a job.

461
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,609
Hey.

462
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,804
What do you think,
Double A?

463
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,872
Would you watch this, huh? Hey hon,
I know I've asked like a million times,

464
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,884
but you happen to see that mask I was
looking for, you know the wooden one--

465
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,614
Okay, a billion times, and no.
Why do you need it so badly?

466
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,555
I don't need it.
Who said I need it? Don't need it.

467
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,559
- Bye.
- Bye.

468
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,720
Bye. Say "Bye, Daddy."
Bye bye.

469
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,731
Bye bye. Here.
You want another one?

470
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,733
Okay, watch,
watch, watch.

471
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,265
"l want you to be
more like Thor."

472
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,271
Oh, what a jerk.

473
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,671
Oh hey!
It's my ear, nose and throat guy.

474
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,675
Odin thinks
he's so great.

475
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,870
Hello! No one even
worships you anymore.

476
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,709
I could have
been a doctor

477
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,840
if the SAT weren't
so culturally biased.

478
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,181
Now, let's see. Oh, "lnfectious
Diseases," that always cracks me up.

479
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,119
Maternity ward.

480
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,281
Okay, first I find
the magic baby,

481
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,156
then downstairs to the cafeteria
for some Jell-O brick.

482
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,685
Who do you have to sting to get some
answers in this place?

483
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,356
Bingo!

484
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,366
All right,
here we go.

485
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,368
Buckle up.

486
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,529
Oh, hold on tight.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

487
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,539
Okay, baby, this
is gonna hurt you

488
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,507
more than it's
gonna hurt me.

489
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,477
Ah!

490
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,685
Okay, let's start with...

491
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,989
uh, July 27th.

492
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,789
Babies born on that day.

493
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,493
Oh, my. Why are there
so many babies born?

494
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,404
- Who are you?
- You.

495
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,436
- Me?
- Who?

496
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,278
- ¢Ü I thank the Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü

497
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,619
- ¢Ü To forget the day ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Forget the day ¢Ü

498
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,626
- ¢Ü A day of up-- uptight time ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Up-- uptight time ¢Ü

499
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,628
- ¢Ü Baby, chase it away ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Chase it away ¢Ü

500
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,290
- ¢Ü I get relaxation ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü

501
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,731
- ¢Ü And it's a time to groove ¢Ü
- ¢Ü A time to groove ¢Ü

502
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,032
- ¢Ü I thank the Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü

503
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,061
¢Ü I thank the Lord
for you ¢Ü

504
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:56,578
¢Ü Talk about plans,
now, baby, I got plenty. ¢Ü

505
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,481
- It's okay.
- ¢Ü Nothing ever seems to turn out ¢Ü

506
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,883
- ¢Ü The way it should. ¢Ü
- It's okay.

507
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,617
- Bottle.
- ¢Ü Seems like just one time ¢Ü

508
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,649
¢Ü I'm feeling good ¢Ü

509
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,686
- ¢Ü I thank the Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü

510
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,221
- ¢Ü To forget the day ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Forget the day... ¢Ü

511
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,494
Huh?

512
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,060
Hmm?

513
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,299
- ¢Ü I get relaxation ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü

514
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,672
- ¢Ü And it's a time to groove ¢Ü
- ¢Ü A time to groove ¢Ü

515
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,735
- ¢Ü I thank the Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü
- ¢Ü Lord for the nighttime ¢Ü

516
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,681
- ¢Ü Baby ¢Ü
- ¢Ü I thank the Lord for you. ¢Ü

517
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,776
¢Ü Save me. ¢Ü

518
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,087
- It's okay, baby. I got him.
- Okay.

519
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,539
Tim.
Tim.

520
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,344
- Okay, it's my turn.
- No, no. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

521
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,408
- It's-- it's my turn?
- He's asleep. He's asleep.

522
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,420
But, baby, can you go in
late to work today?

523
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,981
My office just called. Um, they're
sending me to New York for a week.

524
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,163
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm-- I'm sorry, Daniel.

525
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,828
My wife's gotta go out of town
for work. It's just a week,

526
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,803
but I have to take care
of the baby.

527
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,238
Hey, you gotta do the kid
thing, I understand.

528
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:32,674
Just unfortunate timing.
The network called,

529
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,736
they want to see our green guy
thing by the end of the week,

530
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,578
but I'll just put
Chad on it.

531
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,886
- I'm on it.
- What?

532
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,888
I said I need to be home,
as in my house,

533
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,890
but I didn't say
I couldn't work.

534
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,892
Line up the pitch.
I'm on it,

535
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,917
and I won't let
you down.

536
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,326
Cool. Try to give it that spark I saw
at the Halloween party.

537
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,164
Okay.

538
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,534
I left all the phone numbers
on the refrigerator

539
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,062
and you need to give him a bath
before he goes to bed,

540
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:06,338
but don't get any water in his ears,
'cause he freaks out a little bit.

541
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,005
Um, and if he gets cranky,
you just put him in his car seat

542
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,244
and play the Baby Mozart CD, but don't
just pop him in front of the TV;,

543
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,251
it's gonna
make him stupid.

544
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,310
Um, uh, if you feel
like you're drowning,

545
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,845
just go see Betty down the
street. She has like 10 kids.

546
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,085
- Honey? Do I have to mash his bananas?
- Yeah?

547
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,752
- l-- l--
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.

548
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,193
Can I say goodbye?

549
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,030
Mommy loves you
so much.

550
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,593
Okay.

551
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,628
And Mommy loves you too.

552
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,230
- Mommy, I can't do this.
- Huh? You can.

553
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,741
- I can't.
- You can.

554
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,039
Mommy. Honey, take him.

555
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,171
- Bye.
- Honey, take him.

556
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,805
- I love you.
- Honey, take him.

557
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,782
Bye.

558
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,808
Bye.

559
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,265
Okay.
All right, Alvey.

560
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,234
Okay. All right.
We're gonna have a good time.

561
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,396
Here we go.
Come on. Yes.

562
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,303
Look at the pretty colors.

563
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,802
Oh, look! Ah, ee.

564
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,179
Fun, right?

565
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,651
Look at me!
I'm happy, I'm... happy.

566
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,790
Okay.

567
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,099
Okay, buddy,

568
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,163
it's just you
and me this morning

569
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,175
and we're gonna
have fun and gonna play.

570
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,200
You excited?
Okay.

571
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,908
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Can you get down here now?

572
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,510
- Daniel's asking for you.
- No, I can't come in right now.

573
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,317
- I'm stuck here with my kid.
- You'd better think of something.

574
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,847
He wants to see your drawings
before the pitch on Friday.

575
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,123
All right. I'll do the drawings now
and I'll fax 'em over after lunch.

576
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,153
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

577
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,064
Hey, pal.

578
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,934
Daddy's got a teensy-weensy bit
of work to do,

579
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,938
so can you be a good
boy and let him?

580
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,581
Hello?

581
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,555
- Honey, hey!
- Hey, hon, how you doin'?

582
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,388
So, how are you
and Alvey doing?

583
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,621
Oh, we're doing fine.
Yeah, we're doing great.

584
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,892
Two little peas in a pod.
How's your thing going?

585
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,489
Good. Uh, he loved
the comps,

586
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,557
so now we just gotta rush
it all into production.

587
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,569
So, how's Alvey?

588
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,571
Is he eating?
How's he sleeping?

589
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,835
Hold on, hon.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

590
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,002
Hi! How's my little
womping wompet?

591
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,945
Oh, I miss you. I just want to kiss you
and kiss you and kiss you!

592
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,448
Okay, hon.
Yeah, he loves you too.

593
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,973
- Hurry home. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

594
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,508
Aww.

595
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,987
Well, isn't it great

596
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,580
that her work
is going so well?

597
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,287
- Ma?
- Yes. Ma and her career are just--

598
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,364
- Did you say ma?
- Mama.

599
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,366
Oh my God.
You said mama!

600
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,368
Well, can you say "dad"

601
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,098
- or "da-da?"
- Mommy.

602
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,574
That's great!
You're doing great!

603
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,807
but come on,
say "da-da". Da-da

604
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,644
Mother.

605
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,688
Timmy Tyler,
are you my mask baby?

606
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,066
- Yes?
- Good afternoon!

607
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,005
- May I come in?
- Ah--

608
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,372
What a lovely abode.
Oh my, and such a lush carpet.

609
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,377
You're exactly
the kind of person

610
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,811
the Vacuummeister 3000
was invented for!

611
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,371
Well, if I don't
clean up, no one will.

612
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:08,181
That is why you need
the Vacuummeister 3000!

613
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,585
It has dual sweeps,
durable airpaths,

614
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,486
jiggle control, multi-Teflon
coated filtering

615
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,956
and it's built
with a direct-drive design

616
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,687
that is so powerful,
it sucks the dirt

617
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,285
off the dirt!

618
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,628
- Is that safe?
- Allow me to demonstrate.

619
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,634
- Oh, don't you need to plug it in?
- No.

620
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,067
This is a terrible
demonstration.

621
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,017
Hello, you little...
ugly thing.

622
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,351
Let's see if you're
the one, hmm?

623
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,559
Bend. Morph!

624
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,323
Shape shift.

625
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,354
Well, do something
for Odin's sake.

626
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,937
No!

627
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:10,777
I think it's time to introduce you
to man's best friend.

628
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,012
And I don't
mean you, Otis.

629
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,019
Okay.

630
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,021
Mommy doesn't want me
to do this,

631
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,751
but what Mommy doesn't
know won't hurt her.

632
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,191
-...sour cream and onion...
- Oh, look.

633
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,994
Hey, wait a minute.

634
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,628
We don't like
your attitude!

635
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,264
Keep an eye
on him, will ya?

636
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,839
Look at Bam Bam.

637
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,145
Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!

638
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:49,516
Bam Bam looks miserable
without Pebbles.

639
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,860
Bam.

640
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,959
Bam, bam, bam.

641
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,166
Smoking!

642
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,078
¢Ü Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey ¢Ü

643
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,246
¢Ü Hello, myragtimegal¢Ü

00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,518
¢Ü Send me a kiss

645
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,889
¢Ü Baby, my heart's

646
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,690
¢Ü If you refuse me,
honey, you'll lose me ¢Ü

647
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,698
¢Ü Then you'll be left alone,

648
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,860
¢Ü And tell me
I'm your own. ¢Ü

649
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,233
¢Ü Everybody do
the Michigan rag ¢Ü

650
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,243

¢Ü Stomp, romp,

652
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,280
¢Ü Jump, clump, pump

653
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:04,219
¢ÜThatlovin' rag!¢Ü

654
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,368
¢Ü Please don't talk
about me when I'm gone ¢Ü

655
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,372
¢Ü Oh, honey ¢Ü

656
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:25,136
¢Ü Though our friendship
ceases from now on. ¢Ü

657
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,516
I don't know how.
I don't know which end is up.

658
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,989
I'm running on fumes.

659
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,288
Yeah.
Yeah.

660
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,796
I don't know.

661
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,630
Yeah, I've still
got the kid.

662
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,193
Oh God,
you have no idea.

663
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:29,831
Man, they just suck
the life out of you.

664
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,841
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with him.

665
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,366
I think I may be on to something
for my pitch, though.

666
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,402
I don't know,
it's just--

667
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,140
¢Ü Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey ¢Ü

668
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,176
¢Ü Hello, myragtimegal¢Ü

669
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,586
¢Ü Send me a kiss
by wire ¢Ü

670
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,490
¢Ü Baby, my heart's

671
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,652
¢Ü If you refuse me,
honey, you lose me ¢Ü

672
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,822
¢Ü Then you'll be left alone,
oh, baby, telephone ¢Ü

673
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,265
¢Ü And tell me
I'm your own. ¢Ü

674
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,808
Yow! Ooh!

675
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,587
Hi, 911?
I already told you.

676
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,654
My son is bouncing
off the walls!

677
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,326
Yes, off the walls,
the couch,

678
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,530
and the ceiling.
Hello. Hello? Hello?!

679
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,198
¢Ü Everybody do
the Michigan rag ¢Ü

680
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,437
¢Ü Everybody likes

683
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,045
¢Ü Everybody do

684
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,383
¢Ü Everybody likes

¢ÜThatlovin' rag!¢Ü

686
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,053
Don't stop, little--

687
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,719
- Yeah?
- Betty!

688
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,194
I need your help.

689
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,719
Tim, what's wrong?

690
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,732
Uh, uh, well, Tonya said
if I ever needed--

691
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,291
you know-- oh, uh, well, if any--
if I saw anything weird.

692
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,963
It's Alvey. It's Alvey.
It was Alvey. See?

693
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,472
He was--
he was bouncing

694
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,531
and he-- he did the Woody laugh,
you know...

695
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,372
And he was singing.

696
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,779
Well, lots of babies
his age sing.

697
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,250
Vaudeville?

698
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,446
Okay, I'll show you.

699
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,717
Okay, okay.
Here we go.

700
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,786
Go on. Sing.

701
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,953
Go on, Alvey.

702
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,497
Do it.

703
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,469
Do it.
Sing, damn it!

704
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,472
- Sing--
- Tim!

705
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,373
- He's a baby.
- Exactly my point.

706
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,056
I'm here to unclog
your throne.

707
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,495
Oh, Jason Kemperbee,

708
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,623
be my baby.

709
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,360
Come on.

710
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,837
Hook me up.
Show me the magic.

711
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:24,647
Alvey.

712
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,342
Put that down.

713
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,817
That's Mommy
and Daddy's.

714
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,616
Please put the fax
machine down.

715
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,319
Want some juice?
Here, want some juice?

716
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,798
It's okay. Here you go, Alvey.
Have some juice.

717
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,664
Yeah, you like juice.

718
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,736
See, Alvey?
Daddy's not gonna hurt you.

719
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,797
Whoa! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

720
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,309
No! Hey! Hey! Ah!

721
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,174
Hey! Hey! Hey!

722
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,239
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam!

723
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,582
Rattle.

724
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,354
Aww, poor baby.

725
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,027
Huh? Oh!

726
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,376
Uh-oh.

727
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:28,414

00:48:28,455 --> 00:48:31,083

739
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,044
¢Ü Lord, if they could
see me now. ¢Ü

740
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,091
- Yes?
- Hi!

741
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:13,258
Would you like
some Thin Chocolate?

742
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:23,766
Yeah, you can run,
but you can't hide!

743
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:29,874
Transformers.

744
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:34,387
Alvey?

745
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,719
You-- you wouldn't do that
to Da-da, would you?

746
00:49:36,757 --> 00:49:38,725
I'm your dad.

747
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:41,057
C-can you say "dad"?

748
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:44,064
"Da-da"?

749
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,197
Madre.

750
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,205
This is too much
too handle.

751
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,207
I mean,
this is insanity.

752
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,232
Dancing?

753
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:07,177
No. No.

754
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,781
Shh.

755
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,124
Fire!

756
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:23,136
Bull's-eye!

757
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,343
Hmm?

758
00:50:34,214 --> 00:50:37,115
Here we are
by the baby.

759
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,839
Oh, yeah.
Who's the dog?

760
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,843
Who's the big dog--

761
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,155
Whoa!

762
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,771
Mommy!

763
00:52:48,048 --> 00:52:50,039
I surrender.

764
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,229
Bye-bye.

765
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,582
Oh, shoot.

766
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:29,545
Oh!

767
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,425
Stop it!

768
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,933
This is insane!

769
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,959
Point it down!

770
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:51,570
- All done?
- Hmm.

771
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,890
- Hey, I'm Rod.
- Get in here!

772
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,958
Okay.

773
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,233
Uh, take a look at this.

774
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:20,467
Hey, what a cute
little baby.

775
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,566
- Oh, of course!
- Mind if I take a look at him?

776
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,600
No, go ahead.
I don't care.

777
00:54:26,313 --> 00:54:28,144
Come on.
Do something crazy.

778
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,115
Yeah, do
something crazy!

779
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,415
Crap! Huh-uh, huh-uh.

780
00:54:33,453 --> 00:54:35,444
Damn it. This isn't
the right one either.

781
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:39,359
Hey!
What are you doing?

782
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:41,384
Uh, I left your package
in the foyer.

783
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,690
Do I have a package? Okay.

784
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,643
Oh well.

785
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,072
What happened?

786
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:07,579
You did this to me.
I know what you're doing.

787
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:11,315
You're trying
to drive me crazy.

788
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,019
You're a cunning
little mastermind

789
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,722
who will stop at
nothing until I go

790
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:17,753
completely insane.

791
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,530
Well, come on.

792
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,230
Start dancing again.

793
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,465
Start screwing
with my mind!

794
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:30,999
Start, huh?
Come on!

795
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,415
Why aren't you
screwing with my mind?

796
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:44,424
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

797
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,426
Maybe I am just
going crazy.

798
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,122
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

799
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:51,130
Maybe I am just going crazy.

800
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:54,691
Maybe I am
just going--

801
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:15,549
That's it, buddy.
First I'm taking you to a pediatrician,

802
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:17,580
then I'm taking you
to an exorcist.

803
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:30,963
Who are you?!

804
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:32,972
Oh my G--

805
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:36,237
my son is the devil.
My son is the devil.

806
00:56:36,276 --> 00:56:39,336
Oh my Odin,
it is him.

807
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:44,114
We're just going to have
a nice little drive,

808
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,142
while Daddy has
a nervous breakdown.

809
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:50,120
Please leave a message.

810
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,557
Tonya, it's Betty.
You said I should keep an eye out

811
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,526
and call you if there
are any problems?

812
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:56,290
I think there's a problem.

813
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,645
No parking there.

814
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,739
That's a handicapped zone!

815
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:17,716
Hey! Sir?

816
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:24,489
Hey, wait!

817
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:27,619
Stop! You!

818
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:30,892
Hey!

819
00:57:32,732 --> 00:57:34,700
What is it?

820
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:37,834
- Ah!
- Okay, where is the mask?

821
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,362
- What?
- The mask. My mask. Where is it?

822
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:42,034
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

823
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,736
I am Loki, God of Mischief.

824
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:46,473
Yeah, and I'm Tim, God of Crazy
Babyland. Will you get out of the way?

825
00:57:46,513 --> 00:57:48,003
That baby is born
of the mask-- my mask.

826
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,141
- Now, where is it?!
- Born of the mask-- what?

827
00:57:52,018 --> 00:57:55,112
Oh, so that explains why
he could pee like that!

828
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:58,520
But wait a minute.
This is my baby.

829
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,152
I don't care about that.
Just give me my mask!

830
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:03,162
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh really?

831
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:05,187
Maybe this will
jog your memory!

832
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:11,794
- Loki!!
- Dad?!

833
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:14,033
I've warned you! You've
left me no other choice.

834
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,736
I don't have time for this.
Look, Dad, there's Balder.

835
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,730
- Just give me the mask.
- I don't have it.

836
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:50,943
I think my dog ate it.

837
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:53,605
That is the oldest
excuse in the book,

838
00:58:53,647 --> 00:58:57,105
and I've read some really,
really old books.

839
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,813
But if you want
to do this the hard way...

840
00:59:00,854 --> 00:59:03,152
so be it.

841
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,975
Oh, you're good.

842
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,974
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

843
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,188
You really are a chip
off the old block.

844
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:41,955
But I don't have time for this.
Prepare to feel my true power!

845
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:55,868
Loki!

846
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,039
You have defied me

847
01:00:02,082 --> 01:00:04,607
for the last time.

848
01:00:04,651 --> 01:00:06,278
I've had it up
to here with you!

849
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,117
Dad, please listen to me.
You're holding the baby.

850
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:13,819
Silence!
You have left me no choice.

851
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,953
- Listen, listen--
- You are hereby stripped

852
01:00:15,996 --> 01:00:18,897
of your immortal powers
and forever banished

853
01:00:18,932 --> 01:00:21,230
to the land of mortals.

854
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:23,633
No! Please, hear me out.
That baby--

855
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:38,209
Whoa.

856
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:58,337
- Pretty.
- Whoa.

857
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:01,932
Whoa.

858
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,377
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you, homes?

859
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,506
Your pitch meeting
is starting right now.

860
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:11,312
Um, I just met Green.

861
01:01:11,351 --> 01:01:13,945
- Loki.
- Snap out of it.

862
01:01:13,987 --> 01:01:15,978
Where are you?
I'll pick you up.

863
01:01:21,327 --> 01:01:23,522
What's the deal, Tim?
I get you a network pitch,

864
01:01:23,563 --> 01:01:25,690
and you repay me by showing up
20 minutes late

865
01:01:25,732 --> 01:01:27,461
Iooking like an escaped
mental patient?

866
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,468
Andwith a kid?

867
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:31,868
Huh?

868
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:33,964
This is Tim Avery.

869
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:35,975
He created
the character,

870
01:01:36,009 --> 01:01:38,477
so why don't I just let him
tell you more about it?

871
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:40,502
Tim?

872
01:01:47,187 --> 01:01:49,178
Tim?

873
01:01:53,426 --> 01:01:55,394
Guys, I could walk.

874
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:58,124
I-I guess he didn't
like the pitch.

875
01:01:58,164 --> 01:02:01,759
I just--
I wanna get all my stuff.

876
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:05,364
Tim?

877
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:07,373
Pick up the phone!

878
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,375
Tim!

879
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:11,934
Betty just called.
She's completely freaked out!

880
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,470
Oh, God. Call me the second
you get this message.

881
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:21,554
Hey, it's me.

882
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:23,556
Uh, got your message.

883
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,956
Well, things are
really great here.

884
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,484
Uh, me and Alvey got chased
by a guy named Loki.

885
01:02:29,529 --> 01:02:31,793
Well, that's
not important.

886
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:35,631
I pitched, uh,
my show today,

887
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,636
and, um...

888
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,661
I got fired.

889
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,977
Yeah.

890
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,979
Um...

891
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,981
but Alvey pooped,

892
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,006
which is good, and, uh...

893
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,249
and Alvey saved me.

894
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:58,849
It was amazing.

895
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:00,860
But, uh, uh,
the main thing is, uh,

896
01:03:00,894 --> 01:03:03,419
we're totally fine.
Everything's great.

897
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:06,193
Um, better than fine,
actually.

898
01:03:06,232 --> 01:03:08,063
Alvey's great.

899
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:10,069
I love you.

900
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:12,094
Okay, bye.

901
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:30,485
¢Ü l, well, I see
trees of green ¢Ü

902
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:32,923
¢Ü And red roses too ¢Ü

903
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:38,226
¢Ü I'll watch them bloom
for me and you ¢Ü

904
01:03:38,264 --> 01:03:41,859
¢Ü And I think to myself ¢Ü

905
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:47,100
¢Ü What a wonderful world ¢Ü

906
01:03:49,676 --> 01:03:55,740
¢Ü I hear babies cry
and I watch them grow ¢Ü

907
01:03:55,782 --> 01:04:00,446
¢Ü They'll learn much more
than we'll know ¢Ü

908
01:04:00,486 --> 01:04:04,081
¢Ü And I think to myself ¢Ü

909
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:09,789
¢Ü What a wonderful world. ¢Ü

910
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,124
Whoa!

911
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:23,133
By Kylvie,
King of Svitjod,

912
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,661
Houthedy
and Yppor.

913
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:31,405
I summon thee,
God of Gunningap

914
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:33,435
- Nifleheim, Kvelge--
- Tim?

915
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:39,783
Tim? Is that you?

916
01:05:39,819 --> 01:05:41,480
Tim!

917
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:49,888
Kvelgemir!

918
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:01,373
Who summons Odin,

919
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:03,500
- Allfather of the gods?
- Shh!

920
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,943
- G-- Loki?!
- Shh!

921
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:08,209
- You'll wake the baby.
- Oh, sorry.

922
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:11,705
Loki, is that you?

923
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,378
Tim.

924
01:06:13,419 --> 01:06:14,818
What are you doing
in there?

925
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:17,049
You did
the conjuring ceremony

926
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,058
- by yourself?
- I pay attention.

927
01:06:19,092 --> 01:06:21,822
- Sometimes.
- But you don't have the mask.

928
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:24,887
- Well, yeah, that's why l--
- Rules are rules, Loki!!

929
01:06:24,931 --> 01:06:26,660
And I specifically-- ow!

930
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,066
Could you just stop lecturing me
for one minute and listen?!

931
01:06:31,304 --> 01:06:33,295
I found the baby.
He's right there.

932
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:36,365
- That child is strong.
- Mmm.

933
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,712
Very strong.

934
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:43,045
I had him before.
I was this close,

935
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,380
but you took my powers
and they got away.

936
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,409
So, please, father,

937
01:06:47,453 --> 01:06:49,421
give me my powers

938
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:51,753
and I will
give you the mask.

939
01:06:55,795 --> 01:06:57,763
Very well.

940
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:00,231
Your resourcefulness
pleases me,

941
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,734
and your mother says
we should be trying

942
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,737
"positive reinforcement,"

943
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,739
whatever the Helveti
that is.

944
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,708
So, as a reward,

945
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:13,200
I shall grant you
a reprieve.

946
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:16,477
You have until
the sands have fallen.

947
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:18,484
Oh, hey, hey.
Wait, wait. Hang on.

948
01:07:18,518 --> 01:07:20,213
- Hmm?
- I want to sync up.

949
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:23,017
Ready... now!

950
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:28,392
Don't disappoint me, Loki.
Use your powers wisely

951
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:31,226
and complete your task.
This truly is

952
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:33,255
your final chance!

953
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:58,152
Tim.

954
01:07:58,191 --> 01:08:00,182
What's going on
up there?

955
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:03,752
Tim Avery, what are
you doing in there?

956
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:09,560
Hmm.
Nosy neighbors.

957
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,168
Ah--ah--choo!

958
01:08:32,959 --> 01:08:34,927
- Guess who?
- No! Ah!

959
01:08:36,963 --> 01:08:38,931
Tim, snap out of it!

960
01:08:38,965 --> 01:08:41,297
Baby?

961
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:44,326
- Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

962
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,338
What are you
doing up so late?

963
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,567
- And where's Alvey?
- Seriously.

964
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:50,735
Is that really you?

965
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:52,573
No, you idiot.

966
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:56,207
Oh God.
Ah-- what-- l--

967
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:00,953
Oh Jeez.

968
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:02,955
Bro, listen.

969
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:05,981
I'm a god.
I can shape shift.

970
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:07,993
I can create stuff
out of nothingness.

971
01:09:08,027 --> 01:09:10,086
I can alter
the fabric of reality,

972
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:13,895
so, please, quit being
a knucklehead.

973
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:16,595
- What do you want from us?
- Oh, don't worry.

974
01:09:16,636 --> 01:09:19,070
I'm not gonna
hurt you...

975
01:09:19,105 --> 01:09:21,073
yet!

976
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:23,371
This baby was born
out of the mask,

977
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,570
and I want
my mask back!

978
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,943
Meet me in exactly
one hour.

979
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:36,620
So you find the mask
and meet me at-- hmm.

980
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:40,114
Where shall we meet?
Um, how about Red Lobster?

981
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,753
It's always so difficult getting a table
there, especially on Fridays

982
01:09:42,795 --> 01:09:44,558
- when they do that special.
- There's a wick burning.

983
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,656
Well, how about we meet
in an alley in the city?

984
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:48,667
- There's a wick--
- Met at one before.

985
01:09:48,701 --> 01:09:50,726
- Sure, it's a little cliche...
- Sir, your--

986
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,762
but it's not so cliche that I think
to myself, "Wow, that's too cliche!"

987
01:09:53,806 --> 01:09:56,866
- But-- it-- it--
- Meet me in that alley within the hour,

988
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:58,774
with the mask,

989
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:02,474
if you ever want to see
your little monster again.

990
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:05,507
No!

991
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:11,416
Alvey! No!

992
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,931
What--
Tim?

993
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:33,745
Tim?!

994
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:35,770
Alvey?!

995
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:39,484
Oh God. Tim!

996
01:10:39,518 --> 01:10:41,645
What are you--
what are you--

997
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,158
Tim.
What are you doing?

998
01:10:46,192 --> 01:10:48,183
What are you doing?

999
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,693
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Get off of me!

1000
01:10:54,734 --> 01:10:58,465
Get out of there, Loki!
Where's my son, you mongrel from hell?

1001
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,706
Tim! Ah!

1002
01:11:07,747 --> 01:11:09,738
Tonya?!

1003
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:15,915
Tonya!
Oh, it's really you.

1004
01:11:15,955 --> 01:11:18,617
- Oh my God.
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1005
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:21,456
Betty was right.
You have gone crazy.

1006
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:24,395
No, I haven't.
I thought I did, but I didn't.

1007
01:11:25,798 --> 01:11:27,789
Where's Alvey?

1008
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:30,969
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Where's Alvey?!

1009
01:11:31,003 --> 01:11:32,903
- You're freaking out.
- Where's my baby?!

1010
01:11:32,938 --> 01:11:34,906
- Loki t-took him.
- Took him?!

1011
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,908
Oh my God.
Did you call the police?!

1012
01:11:36,942 --> 01:11:38,933
- No, l--
- Oh my God.

1013
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,412
Tonya, listen!

1014
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:44,416
- This is an emergency!
- Tonya!!

1015
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:47,180
- My son is missing--
- No, Tonya, listen!

1016
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:50,086
The police can't help us!
He's the freaking God of Mischief.

1017
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:52,716
All he wants is his mask,
which Otis is wearing.

1018
01:11:52,758 --> 01:11:56,023
And if I can just figure
out where Otis is, I can just--

1019
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,030
of course!

1020
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,522
Our child is missing and you're worried
about the damned dog?!

1021
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,694
This is crazy!

1022
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,203
See what I'm
talking about?

1023
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,102
Now, you're gonna
have to trust me

1024
01:12:07,139 --> 01:12:10,768
and get in the car, because I know where
Alvey is and I know how to get him back,

1025
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,778
because I know the one place
Otis the moose would go.

1026
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:14,780
¢Ü And they called it ¢Ü

1027
01:12:14,814 --> 01:12:18,181
¢Ü Puppy love. ¢Ü

1028
01:12:19,852 --> 01:12:22,616
¢Ü Oh, I guess they'll
never know. ¢Ü

1029
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:28,760
See there's this really
cute pooch Venus.

1030
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:30,523
Otis?

1031
01:12:30,563 --> 01:12:32,895
Otis!

1032
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,765
That's not Otis!
That's a green critter.

1033
01:12:35,801 --> 01:12:37,769
I'm sorry, okay?

1034
01:12:37,803 --> 01:12:40,533
I've ignored you
and I've been impatient,

1035
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:43,804
but I need you, buddy.
Loki, that guy that made the mask?

1036
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:45,811
He wants it back.
He has Alvey.

1037
01:12:45,845 --> 01:12:47,813
And he's a bad guy,
Otis.

1038
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:50,315
He hates dogs.

1039
01:12:50,349 --> 01:12:52,977
He doesn't realize that dogs
are truly man's best friend.

1040
01:12:53,018 --> 01:12:54,986
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1041
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,420
You're this man's
best friend.

1042
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,947
But Alvey's my son

1043
01:12:59,992 --> 01:13:02,483
which sort of makes you
like his big brother.

1044
01:13:02,528 --> 01:13:05,861
And when he grows up,
he's gonna be your bestest friend.

1045
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,101
But right now,
he needs you

1046
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,968
and he needs that mask.

1047
01:13:15,608 --> 01:13:17,599
All right.

1048
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,445
So, I guess you're

1049
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,478
kinda cute, huh?

1050
01:13:32,358 --> 01:13:34,326
Um, can you, like,

1051
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,328
do anything you want,
like me?

1052
01:13:36,362 --> 01:13:38,353
I mean, can you
do this?

1053
01:13:43,903 --> 01:13:45,666
Wow.

1054
01:13:45,704 --> 01:13:47,672
Well, look at you!

1055
01:13:47,706 --> 01:13:49,674
You're just a little
outlaw, ain't you?

1056
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:02,051
Okay, hombre. Let's see how tough
your rawhide can be.

1057
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:22,166
Gotcha.

1058
01:14:27,413 --> 01:14:29,711
I like it!

1059
01:14:29,748 --> 01:14:32,376
So, you like games, huh?

1060
01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:34,386
Well you'd better watch out

1061
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:37,184
'cause I've got a game
that no one can beat me at.

1062
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,787
Super Twister!

1063
01:14:42,628 --> 01:14:44,596
It's just around
the corner, right here.

1064
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,598
Here we go.

1065
01:14:46,632 --> 01:14:49,465
¢Ü Come on, baby ¢Ü

1066
01:14:49,502 --> 01:14:52,494
¢Ü Let's do the twist ¢Ü

1067
01:14:52,538 --> 01:14:55,302
¢Ü Come on, baby ¢Ü

1068
01:14:55,341 --> 01:14:57,309
¢Ü Let's do the twist ¢Ü

1069
01:14:57,343 --> 01:14:59,311
¢Ü Take me
by my little hand... ¢Ü

1070
01:14:59,345 --> 01:15:01,313
Isn't this fun?

1071
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:03,338
¢Ü And go like this ¢Ü

1072
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:07,816
- ¢Ü Ee-oh, twist. ¢Ü
- Hi.

1073
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:09,616
¢Ü Baby, baby, twist ¢Ü

1074
01:15:09,655 --> 01:15:14,354
¢Ü Whoo, yeah. ¢Ü

1075
01:15:14,393 --> 01:15:16,953
- Ah!
- ¢Ü Just like this ¢Ü

1076
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:20,022
¢Ü Come on, little miss ¢Ü

1077
01:15:20,065 --> 01:15:23,865
¢Ü And do the twist. ¢Ü

1078
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:26,303
- No, that's cheating.
- ¢Ü Let's all do it. ¢Ü

1079
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:30,833
Whoa!

1080
01:15:30,876 --> 01:15:32,867
Whoa!

1081
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,948
No fair! That crash
threw me. Rematch!

1082
01:15:49,228 --> 01:15:51,253
Okay, you give me Alvey,

1083
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,128
and the mask is yours.

1084
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,840
I can't let go.
I've grown attached.

1085
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:13,852
- Alvey!
- Hey, we had a deal!

1086
01:16:13,886 --> 01:16:16,650
I'm the God of friggin' Mischief,
what did you expect?

1087
01:16:49,788 --> 01:16:51,756
- Huh.
- Hey, Loki.

1088
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,781
Honey, you look hot.

1089
01:16:54,793 --> 01:16:57,057
Give me back my son!

1090
01:16:57,096 --> 01:16:59,087
Um... no.

1091
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,294
Honey, I think
it's time we trade up.

1092
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:24,283
Buckle up, baby.

1093
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,699
Listen to Loki, kid.

1094
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:38,430
Dads are overrated
and I speak from experience.

1095
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:43,072
Ah, there's nothing
like a Sunday drive.

1096
01:17:44,943 --> 01:17:47,411
You wanna have some fun,
kid, you stick with me.

1097
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:02,584
All right. It's time
to lose them for good.

1098
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:13,403
Oh, look out,
look out, look out!

1099
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:16,468
Yahoo!

1100
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,150
Whoa!!

1101
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,821
Hey, babe, look.
No hands. I'm kidding.

1102
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:33,484
Let's just
finish this.

1103
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,658
Now, where did he go?

1104
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:42,667
- Hmm.
- Uh, honey?

1105
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:44,931
I think, maybe, there?

1106
01:19:00,085 --> 01:19:03,418
And here he is,folks,

1107
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:06,686
the failure of Fringe City,

1108
01:19:06,725 --> 01:19:11,992
Yes, it's
Tim "No-win" Avery!

1109
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,726
Tim, it's Alvey.
I'm gonna go get him.

1110
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:16,758
Kick his can, honey.

1111
01:19:30,983 --> 01:19:34,316
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1112
01:19:37,256 --> 01:19:39,315
Hi, baby.
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

1113
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,850
Oh, yeah? Well, jump
like a grasshopper

1114
01:19:42,895 --> 01:19:45,489
and stink like a skunk!

1115
01:19:46,965 --> 01:19:48,990
Caught me
with my mouth open!

1116
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,298
You can't fight me
if you're locked in a trunk.

1117
01:19:51,336 --> 01:19:52,826
Huh?

1118
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:59,542
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1119
01:20:10,155 --> 01:20:12,953
Let's get out of this dump.
Come on.

1120
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:16,154
And Loki said, "Let there
be a brick wall!"

1121
01:20:16,195 --> 01:20:18,891
And there was!

1122
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:21,996
Okay!

1123
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:24,867
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

1124
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:30,408
Say hello to my
little friend!

1125
01:20:36,849 --> 01:20:38,714
Tim! Tim!

1126
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,554
Here's Loki!

1127
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,921
Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,
T-T-T-T-T--

1128
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:08,776
Wait.

1129
01:21:08,814 --> 01:21:10,281
This is a waste
of time.

1130
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:12,545
We're evenly-matched
opponents.

1131
01:21:14,887 --> 01:21:16,878
I think we should
let the kid decide.

1132
01:21:18,023 --> 01:21:20,491
Why, that's
a swell idea.

1133
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:30,460
Alvey, this is
your decision.

1134
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,597
- Pick me, pick me!
- Alvey?

1135
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:38,576
- I'm your real dad!
- Come on, you little devil. Let's play!

1136
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:41,738
- Come on, Alvey.
- Alvey.

1137
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:49,284
Alvey?

1138
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,051
- Yeah, that's right.
- Tim!

1139
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,752
Son.

1140
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:13,268
Alvey,
look at me.

1141
01:22:13,312 --> 01:22:15,576
It's your dad.

1142
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:17,514
There's no more
superpowers.

1143
01:22:18,784 --> 01:22:20,809
I know at first
I was kind of a jerk.

1144
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,183
I didn't know
how to handle a son,

1145
01:22:25,223 --> 01:22:27,953
but you helped me
grow up.

1146
01:22:27,993 --> 01:22:30,120
And I want
to repay you

1147
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:32,153
by helping you
grow up.

1148
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:35,730
I love you.

1149
01:22:39,438 --> 01:22:41,565
Come on.

1150
01:22:45,978 --> 01:22:48,913
- Da-da.
- Oh, Alvey.

1151
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:51,438
It's my son.

1152
01:22:53,752 --> 01:22:55,720
Yes.

1153
01:22:58,757 --> 01:23:01,783
I just wanted
a friend.

1154
01:23:46,538 --> 01:23:48,597
Push! Push!

1155
01:24:03,688 --> 01:24:05,417
Huh?

1156
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:42,791
Off the throne.
He's off the throne. That's not good.

1157
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,591
Your time is up, son.

1158
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:48,121
As expected, you failed
in your promise.

1159
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:50,134
You failed in your quest.

1160
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:54,229
You are, in every sense
of the word,

1161
01:24:54,272 --> 01:24:57,002
- a failure.
- And I thought your dad was mean.

1162
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:59,010
Hey, we both knew
it would end like this, right?

1163
01:24:59,044 --> 01:25:01,604
You always set me up to fail.
At least in that respect,

1164
01:25:01,646 --> 01:25:04,206
- I'm living up to your expectations.
- Silence!

1165
01:25:04,249 --> 01:25:07,480
You've brought me
much pain, Loki.

1166
01:25:09,488 --> 01:25:12,548
Right back
at you, Dad.

1167
01:25:12,591 --> 01:25:14,354
- Hey!
- Tim, no!

1168
01:25:14,392 --> 01:25:16,724
Hang on just a minute,
Grizzly Adams.

1169
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:19,457
I don't know how things work
in the god world,

1170
01:25:19,498 --> 01:25:22,899
but you're his father,
he's your son.

1171
01:25:22,934 --> 01:25:26,131
And even if you banish him,
he's still gonna be your son.

1172
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:32,009
There is nothing more important
in this entire universe

1173
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,443
than your relationship
with your family,

1174
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:36,140
especially
if you're immortal.

1175
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:38,649
You're like 1,000,
he's like 800,

1176
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:40,412
so you might as well
get things right now

1177
01:25:40,452 --> 01:25:42,977
and enjoy the rest
of your eternal life.

1178
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:46,683
Here's the thing.
Just take it.

1179
01:25:50,595 --> 01:25:53,530
Okay?
Loosen up.

1180
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:11,679
Come on, son.
Let's go home.

1181
01:26:11,716 --> 01:26:13,650
- Okay?
- Okay.

1182
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,111
Godspeed.

1183
01:26:21,893 --> 01:26:24,862
Maybe now, I can help you
patch things up with Mom?

1184
01:26:24,896 --> 01:26:26,625
Don't push it.

1185
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:45,980
A baby and a dog competing
for Dad's attention--

1186
01:26:46,017 --> 01:26:48,315
I love it.

1187
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:52,084
Simple, but it's--
it's got--

1188
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:55,149
- Spark?
- Yes.

1189
01:26:55,193 --> 01:26:57,423
Where did you
get the idea?

1190
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:02,365
Well, I just kind of quit
trying so hard and...

1191
01:27:04,903 --> 01:27:06,996
the idea just
came to me.

1192
01:27:07,038 --> 01:27:09,336
It's great.

1193
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,362
Yay! Yay!

1194
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:43,499
Honey, oh.

1195
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:46,635
That was such
a good show!

1196
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:50,375
But I think you might
need to add another character.

1197
01:27:50,415 --> 01:27:52,076
What?

1198
01:27:55,587 --> 01:27:57,714
- Really?
- Yeah.

1199
01:28:02,394 --> 01:28:04,692
What do you think about that,
Double A?

1200
01:28:04,729 --> 01:28:06,754
A little brother
or sister?

1201
01:28:06,798 --> 01:28:08,698
How does
that sound?

1202
01:28:30,355 --> 01:28:34,223
¢Ü Life, it sails
on the ocean ¢Ü

1203
01:28:34,259 --> 01:28:38,320
¢Ü It can swallow
the hills alone ¢Ü

1204
01:28:38,363 --> 01:28:41,025
¢Ü But you don't have
to see to know ¢Ü

1205
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,934
¢Ü Time, it can fly
with the wind ¢Ü

1206
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:48,666
¢Ü I imagine
the world above ¢Ü

1207
01:28:48,707 --> 01:28:52,837
¢Ü And it's all
inside your mind ¢Ü

1208
01:28:54,646 --> 01:28:59,379
¢Ü Would you follow
me tonight? ¢Ü

1209
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:04,582
¢Ü Find what the world
has for us inside ¢Ü

1210
01:29:04,622 --> 01:29:08,752
¢Ü But one other way
is clear ¢Ü

1211
01:29:08,793 --> 01:29:13,628
¢Ü Now it's time
for you both to grow ¢Ü

1212
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:18,329
¢Ü Just close your eyes
and dream ¢Ü

1213
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:23,433
¢Ü Of the endless
possibilities ¢Ü

1214
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:28,375
¢Ü Life, it sails
on the ocean ¢Ü

1215
01:29:28,413 --> 01:29:32,372
¢Ü It can swallow
the hills alone ¢Ü

1216
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:35,113
¢Ü But you don't
have to see to know ¢Ü

1217
01:29:35,153 --> 01:29:38,884
¢Ü Time, it can fly
with the wind ¢Ü

1218
01:29:38,923 --> 01:29:42,689
¢Ü I imagine
the world above ¢Ü

1219
01:29:42,727 --> 01:29:47,562
¢Ü And it's all
inside your mind ¢Ü

1220
01:29:57,242 --> 01:30:00,575
¢Ü Many places
hiding deep inside¢Ü

1221
01:30:00,612 --> 01:30:03,080
¢Ü A world that's
right there fighting ¢Ü

1222
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:07,380
¢Ü in all ourlives¢Ü

1223
01:30:09,387 --> 01:30:13,153
¢Ü Life, it sails
on the ocean ¢Ü

1224
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:17,287
¢Ü It can swallow
the hills alone ¢Ü

1225
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,990
¢Ü But you don't
have to see to know ¢Ü

1226
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:23,967
¢Ü Time, it can fly
with the wind ¢Ü

1227
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:27,836
¢Ü I imagine
the world above ¢Ü

1228
01:30:27,872 --> 01:30:32,070
¢Ü And it's all
inside your mind ¢Ü

1229
01:30:35,413 --> 01:30:40,112
¢Ü And it's all
inside your mind. ¢Ü

1230
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,878
¢Ü Okay ¢Ü

1231
01:30:43,922 --> 01:30:45,981
¢Ü Now, on the one
now ¢Ü

1232
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,458
¢Ü One, two, three, oh! ¢Ü

1233
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:53,595
¢Ü Likethis¢Ü

1234
01:30:53,631 --> 01:30:56,532

¢Ü You know
you got it, baby ¢Ü

1239
01:31:07,145 --> 01:31:08,908
¢Ü Still, don't let it
drive you crazy ¢Ü

1240
01:31:08,947 --> 01:31:11,541
¢Ü There's no if or buts
or maybe-- you can be a star ¢Ü

1241
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:14,814
¢Ü You can reach your highest goal
if you search within your soul ¢Ü

1242
01:31:14,853 --> 01:31:17,913
¢Ü When you have control,
you know who you are ¢Ü

¢Ü 'Cause when we stick together,
we can make it, make it, make it ¢Ü

1250
01:31:35,974 --> 01:31:38,966
¢Ü Put yourself together

1251
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,602
¢Ü You can take it,
take it, take it ¢Ü

1252
01:31:40,645 --> 01:31:42,408
