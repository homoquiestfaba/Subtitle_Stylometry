[upbeat music plays]

2
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,457
Beth, I thought you were
practicing at the Lawrence's.

3
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:05,664
And you're the realtor
whose SUV is blocking
the driveway?

4
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:12,271
Um, I could get you a better
price if the windows
weren't so... old.

5
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,474
- And the insulation...
- Otherwise known as sweaters.

6
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:21,580
- She's funny, your mom.
- Yes, she is. Hilarious.

7
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,319
- Have you had the
electrical updated?
- Mm...

8
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,555
And the pipes?

9
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,759
Do not dial that phone.

10
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,102
Oh, no. No!

11
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:49,475
What? Oh, oh!

12
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:52,744
- Jo.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Holding thought.

13
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,247
You forgot your phone again.

14
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,716
What? How did you know?

15
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,618
Because your
sister just texted me.

16
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,889
God. Thank you.

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,750
Hey. Tell me she hasn't
signed anything

18
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,485
or I'm going to punch that
realtor person in the face.

19
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,522
If you're going
to carry three phones,
maybe one should be yours.

20
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,757
I shouldn't have
even said anything.

21
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,793
I cannot believe she's seriously
going to sell Orchard House.

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,702
Dry rot.
Or carpenter ants.

23
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,638
Or both.

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,239
- Very loud carpenter ants.
- [footsteps]

25
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,942
- It's not for sale.
- Your days are numbered.

26
00:02:56,944 --> 00:03:00,412
You said don't dial.
You didn't say
anything about texting.

27
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,749
Lawyer. Writer. Artist.

28
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:06,752
Well, I'm right, aren't I?
I know people.

00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,890
Oh, well, see,
that's a mother's love talking.

31
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,929
- There's no way you're...
- You can't sell the house.

32
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,531
Girls, your father and I
were going to break it to you

33
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,501
when we got back
from Afghanistan. Gently.

34
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,871
- [all shouting]
- Girls!

35
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:29,608
Whoa, that's impressive.
You should bottle that.

36
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,348
Call me when you're ready.

37
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,691
[sighs] All right, sad faces.
Who wants to help me pack?

38
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,994
- Are you insane?
- You just can't!

39
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:53,999
- Just because the house
needs a little fixing up...
- It's more than that, Jo.

40
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,835
The electrical goes on and off
at will, the plumbing leaks,

41
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,305
there's literally an arctic
breeze blowing through
this house all winter.

42
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,274
You always said that
the cold keeps you young.

43
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:07,879
Yes, well, that's
before I got old...
and your father was injured.

44
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,449
Your father needs
to focus on his recovery,

45
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,852
not spend all his time
fixing leaky pipes.

46
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,356
- You said that Dad was
going to be fine.
- He will be.

47
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,691
He just can't be the
family handyman anymore.

48
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,664
[sighs] I can see you guys
are gonna be a lot of help.

49
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,667
Look, girls, we just
can't keep putting money
into this house.

50
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,003
We can't afford it.
We need something smaller.

51
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,673
A two-bedroom condo
with reliable heat.

52
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,775
Two bedrooms?
What about us?

53
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,346
[chuckles] You didn't think
you were gonna live here
forever, did you?

54
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,716
[Margaret laughs]

55
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,453
Meg will ace the bar and get
a great job at a big firm.

56
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,958
- We don't know that, Mom.
- And Jo will win fame
and fortune with her writing.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,394
I don't know if what
I do qualifies as writing.

58
00:04:55,396 --> 00:05:00,632
And Amy will hit her expiration
date with this theater thing

59
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,369
and leave again for some
far-off corner of the earth.

60
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,038
Ouch.

61
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,341
Your father's and my future
is going to be that
of empty-nesters

62
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,910
in a smaller,
easier to maintain nest.

63
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,821
Beth... will figure out
what Beth wants.

64
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,090
I want you
to keep Orchard House.

65
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,492
All right, we'll talk about this
when we get back in January.

66
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,929
- Excuse me, when?
- You're missing Christmas?

67
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,338
This year I leave Christmas
and Orchard House to you.

68
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,075
- We can't do Christmas
without you!
- Girls, girls!

69
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,077
[sighs]

70
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,846
You are not little girls
anymore, you are
little women now.

71
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:53,085
I'm only gonna
be gone for two months.
What could possibly go wrong?

Hey, hey! [laughs]

76
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,676
It's your party!
Why aren't you partying?

77
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,512
You... Wow, you look amazing.

78
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:25,851
- Anachronistic, but amazing.
- Anachro-mazing. I like that.

79
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,954
- What is this
Is that your app?
- Uh... No, that's nothing.

80
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,956
- No, let me see!
- It's not, no...

81
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,058
You said you'd let me see it
when you launched it!

82
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,093
- Come on, please! Please!
- No!

83
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,562
- It's porn, isn't it?
- Yes, it's porn.

84
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,766
Oh, my God! I wanna see it!
Let me see!

85
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,670
Christmas countdown?

86
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:49,941
Teddy Goldenboy Lawrence!

87
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,744
I told you,
it's not finished.

88
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,882
- Oh! It's... cute.
- Shut up.

89
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:01,820
[laughs] So, what are you
gonna do? Get dressed.
Put on a costume.

90
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:06,491
You can't go as yourself...
rich and useless.

91
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,794
- Oh! Hey!
- Here you go.

92
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:13,932
- Let's party.
- Oh! Oh, my God! Wow.

93
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,936
- [music plays]
- [indistinct chatter]

94
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,706
- Hi, guys!
- What's the
thread count, Adonis?

95
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,977
You really did a number on these
decorations this year, Chicklet.

96
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,146
Teddy, I'm too old
to be called Chicklet.

97
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,849
I'm sorry, every time
I see your face,
I see that snaggle-toothed

98
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:35,086
- little girl I grew up with.
- Oh, my gosh!

99
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,995
Wait a minute. Teddy.
You know what you
should do with that app?

100
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,499
You should, um, link it to
a charity, like Toys for Tots.

101
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,702
- Make it a "be Santa" app.
- [chuckles]

102
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,706
- That's genius.
Why didn't I think of that?
- Because I thought of that.

103
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,543
Why don't I get you a drink
to celebrate your brilliance.

104
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,846
- Teddy, get me a drink.
- That would be
corrupting a minor.

105
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,014
- Feel free.
- Amy.

106
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,823
Oh! Hello!

107
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,928
Why am I looking at Meg
making out with Douche Bag Dan?

108
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,801
- Because, uh, John is here.
- You didn't.

109
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,837
What? The guy leaves January 1st
to go teach little kids

110
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,974
in an impoverished country.
What am I supposed to do? Let
him spend the holidays alone?

111
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,110
I don't want to go
through that again.
Neither do you.

112
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,246
- No, we don't.
- Love makes people stupid.

113
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,715
You cannot judge love unless
you've been in love,

114
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,850
which you,
Jo March, have never been.

115
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,052
Yeah, and I never will be.

116
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,089
Not until I'm published
and incredibly successful.

117
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,792
Uh, you are published.
Just not as yourself.

118
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,166
- [man] Hail Caesar! Oh...
- Hi!

119
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,136
- Hey! What's up?
- John! Wow!

120
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,273
Nice, nice costume.
You look, uh, like a UPS man.

121
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,742
- [laughter]
- How have you been? Good?

122
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,744
John, you knew if you were
staying here you were gonna

123
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,280
- run into Meg
sooner or later, right?
- I knew.

124
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:12,017
Look, I wasn't the biggest fan
of you and Meg together,

125
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,086
but I can't stand
this guy with her,

126
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:19,257
so let's get smashed
and dull our shared pain.

127
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,662
- Lead the way.
- I will. It's right over here.
This way.

128
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,073
Excuse me, my dear fellow,
I seemed to have lost
my favorite clown.

129
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,176
Ah! There she is.

130
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,147
Come on, you're not gonna
go all chaperone-y on me,
are you, Mr. L?

131
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,351
Elementary, my dear Amy.
Elementary.

132
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:54,259
You can hide at our house
and hand out candy with Beth

133
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:59,698
- until Dan goes.
- I'm good. I'm fine.

134
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,768
Band-Aid ripped.
I'm so ripped...

135
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,805
Excellent.

136
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,907
Mm! That's not punch.

137
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,046
- Oh, the tragedy of youth.
- Hey...

138
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,686
- I'm staying with Ted.
- Oh.

139
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,656
Meg, I gotta go. Peace.

140
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,158
- Watch out.
- Bye.

141
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,997
John, I love my sister, but
she has terrible taste in men.

142
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,770
[laughter]

143
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,005
John, go after her, will you?

144
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,072
Keep your eye on her.

145
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,908
Don't let her out
of your sight.

146
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,214
Are you going to miss me?

147
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:53,685
What's there to miss
when I can Skype-sex you?

148
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,191
Look, Meg, if I don't get going,
I'm going to miss my flight.

149
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,428
I'll give you a call
when I get to San Francisco, OK?

150
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,302
I had a good time tonight.

151
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,338
Yeah... OK.

152
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,882
Well, it's not a blown fuse.

153
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,085
Did we pay the bill?

154
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,454
Maybe it's a Halloween trick,

155
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:33,158
and tomorrow all the lights
will magically pop back on.

156
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,729
Maybe Mom was right,
and this place is totally
falling down around us.

157
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,198
[sobbing]

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,469
Beth, you can't cry every
time we talk about this.

159
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:49,708
I can too. I've only ever
wanted to live here, Jo.

160
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,043
I can! I can cry if I want to!
I'm sorry!

161
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,180
OK, Beth, but maybe you should
look at this as an opportunity

162
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:59,050
to move on and figure out
what you wanna do
with your life and...

163
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:08,860
Look, if ghost-tweeting
celebs' lives

164
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,929
earned me a living,

165
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,366
and you wouldn't have
to go anywhere.

166
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:19,804
- Yeah. I'm cold.
- I'm freezing.

167
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,473
Those fishnets aren't
keeping you warm?

168
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,042
They would have if
Mr. Lawrence hadn't interrupted.

169
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,478
- Slut!
- Frozen slut.

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,148
- Slut-sicle.
- [laughter]

171
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,751
That's a good one.

172
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,052
[sighs]

173
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,455
I can't imagine
coming home to anywhere else.

174
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,824
I know.

175
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,928
It'll all be OK, though.

176
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,099
Why Meg thinks
she needs some rich guy,

177
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,137
when we all know perfectly well
she can and will take
care of herself...

178
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,277
You're just remembering
what she told you in college.

179
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,247
Do you wanna go over there

180
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,515
and comfort poor, lonely Meg?

181
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,117
Because I will go with you.

182
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,253
In case Jo is there?

183
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:13,558
Friends with absolutely
no benefits whatsoever.

184
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,564
No balls. None.
OK? Both of you.
Just... ball-less wonders.

185
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,868
No! You got four
perfectly fine women
in that house right over there,

186
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,205
a short walk away, two of them
the loves of your lives...

187
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,441
- I don't know about that.
- Meg and I have been
over for years.

188
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:34,479
And you two sit here, alone.
Right? Complaining.

189
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,982
Moaning. Pissing. OK?
I cannot believe

190
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:44,088
Are you two gonna go fight
for these women or not?

191
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,259
Answer me!

192
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,431
We should throw a kick-ass
good-bye Orchard House party.

193
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,168
- More like a funeral.
- Kill-joys.

194
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,105
What if someone actually
wrecks the house, though?

195
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,932
Papier maching is not
remodeling, Amy.

196
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:33,438
Well, there's something called
the Internet that will tell us
how to fix everything

197
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,940
- that needs fixing.
- I don't know.

198
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:41,212
And they could afford to do
it themselves, if they
hadn't paid for our college

199
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,648
and your law school
and your piano lessons

200
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,950
and your strange battles
with the law in Thailand.

201
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,320
- I'm going to pay everybody
back someday, I swear.
- Mm-hm.

202
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:53,992
Your generation with its
tweeting and hooking.

203
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,198
That's an important distinction.

204
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,401
You're good at
talking about the girls.

205
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,337
But I don't see you
going after them.

206
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,340
[sighs] We're respecting
what they say.

207
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:14,112
No, it's not respect,
it's cowardice. You respect them
by engaging with them.

208
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,949
By showing them
what they're worth.
Make them notice you.

209
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,585
- Believe me, in my day...
- When you communicated
by cave painting?

210
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,388
- [laughs]
- OK, you can
laugh all you want

211
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,990
at the lack of technology
in my formative years,
but, I'll tell you,

212
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:29,594
we had no problem getting
women to fall for us.

213
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,364
We were respectfully relentless.
We courted.

214
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,367
- Courted?
- Yeah.

215
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,271
And that does not mean texting
in the middle of the night,
hoping for a booty call.

216
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,274
[chuckling]

217
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,677
Come on, we owe it to them.
You know that.

218
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,447
No, OK, I know.

219
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,216
But you're working three jobs,

220
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,153
and her play opens in December,
and I have to study.
It's just...

221
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,688
We don't have time.
It's too much.

222
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,323
It's not too much.

223
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,692
You know that we're going
to convince you sooner or later

224
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,561
this is the right thing to do.

225
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,430
Or we'll do the
whole thing ourselves

226
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,565
and not let you be
in control of any of it.

227
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:13,204
- Oh, wow! Nicely done, Bethy.
- You guys are evil. All of you.

228
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:20,445
Although I really have
been wanting to paint over
that nasty stain in the ceiling.

229
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:25,416
- [gasping]
- Oh, the stain! Yay!

230
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,720
John, Meg may think she
that wants financial security,

231
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,058
and all the things that
you bring to the table.

232
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,627
- Yeah, maybe, but...
- And Teddy,

233
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:42,166
you have to use that knowledge
to get her to let you in.

234
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,671
- Right, but she...
- You two guys love these girls!
Am I right?

235
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,509
Then I dare you to prove to me
that your generation

236
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:57,048
- is not a lost cause.
- You want us to prove to you
that we can get them into bed?

237
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,518
No, no. On the contrary!
No, completely on the contrary.

238
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,587
OK, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

239
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,290
You have to lead with romance,
my friends. Romance.

240
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:10,228
You have to kiss them. You have
to get them to kiss you.

241
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,697
I mean, really, really kiss you,
not when they're drunk.

242
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,502
And not under the mistletoe.
Get a March sister

243
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,772
to fall in love with you.

244
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:24,208
Restore my faith in my own kind.

245
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,712
A kiss by Christmas.

246
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,685
- What just happened?
- We got schooled.

247
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,522
[laughing]

248
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,397
OK, screwdrivers, check.
Vise grips, check.

249
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,699
Claw hammers... check.

250
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,670
Um, OK. Fix the floors in the
kitchen and hardwood throughout.

251
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,339
Replace leaky plumbing,
winterize the windows,

252
00:17:55,341 --> 00:18:02,747
remove all old lead paint,
replace the water heater
and all the electrical.

253
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,248
We can't do all this ourselves.

254
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,683
- Yeah, we can.
- Maybe Bob at the front desk

255
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,685
can recommend someone
for electrical.

256
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,420
I can take care of that too.

257
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,656
Amy, hanging Christmas lights

258
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,125
does not make you
a wiring expert.

259
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,827
I've been working with Jed
down at the theater.

260
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:19,831
Making out with the
tech director does not
make you an expert either.

261
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,533
- That's not what he says.
- Wow!

262
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:26,537
- [laughter]
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna
pretend I didn't hear that.

263
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,110
[groans]
We can't afford... this.

264
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:36,481
We can't afford any of this.
I think we have to put it back.

265
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,418
- All of it?
- Yeah. Yep.
We're gonna put it back.

266
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,786
We'll figure something out.

267
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:51,496
I miss you too. No,
I know, the time difference
is difficult.

268
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,469
Honestly, Dan, it's kind of
difficult to stay turned on
when you're texting me

269
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,339
- in between red lights.
- OK, hi, bye. Bye, Dan. Bye.

270
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:05,143
- Are you crazy?
- Girls, I thought we would
need some chocolate for this.

271
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,646
- Look!
- Another thing for the list.

272
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,882
OK, I don't think we have
any more room on the list.

273
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:14,519
- I talked to Bob
about the electrical.
- I said I was gonna do that.

274
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:20,725
You guys have no faith
that I can do anything.
You treat me like a baby.

275
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,527
- I'm 20.
- [all] We know!

276
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,297
And I'm capable of a lot more
than you think I am.

277
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,499
OK, that's really annoying.

278
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,870
OK, so, all for Bob
doing the electrical

279
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,173
and all of us doing
the rest ourselves, aye.

280
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,374
- Aye.
- Aye.

281
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,544
- Beth!
- Let's talk cash.

282
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:43,481
I'm putting the feelers out
for a new client,
but Sean, Curtis and Natalia

283
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,516
don't want me taking on someone
who might overlap.

284
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:57,328
I could postpone my trip
with Dan, though, and just stay
and be an extra pair of hands.

285
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,232
- OK.
- I have a little money
saved up, but that means

286
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,702
- no Christmas presents
this year.
- That's fine. Amy?

287
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,371
You have heard the expression
"theater doesn't pay," right?

288
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,377
[laughter]

289
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,514
- Oh, my God!
- [saw buzzing]

290
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,783
What is that?

291
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,358
- Teddy?
- Why do you have
all this stuff?

292
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,562
You guys can't fix up the house
without this stuff.
It's top of the line.

293
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,299
- You bought all this?
- You are the best. [laughs]

294
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:39,570
- Um, we can't take this.
- Jo. Yeah, we can.

295
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,608
You are the nicest guy,
Teddy Lawrence, but we
just can't take all this.

296
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,713
No, no, please, please, do not
pull that virtuous "March girls
must do it all ourselves" crap.

297
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:52,717
Don't worry, we never
put you and virtuous
in the same sentence.

298
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,288
You need tools, I got you tools.

299
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,956
Two words for that:
"thank" and "you."

300
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,627
How about, "take them back"?
All of them. Now!

301
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,663
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I just did. Deal with it.

302
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:09,000
- Oh, really?
- I hate when they fight.

303
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,636
Oh, my God! You are such a baby!

304
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,405
We've been over this
a million times before.

305
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,507
Yeah, simple fact.
I have money, you don't.

306
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,376
Why do you think it's a mortal
sin to spread the wealth?

307
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,878
You can't buy stuff
so that people will like you.

308
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,414
[laughs] Well, I kind of
thought you liked me already.

309
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,420
How many times did your mom
check in on me when I was sick?

310
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,789
How often was I included,
was I made to feel like part
of your family,

311
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,658
when I wasn't part at all?

312
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,026
You are part of our family,

313
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,361
and you should know us
well enough to know by now

314
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:42,466
that you can do what you can do.
But you can't do this.

315
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,535
God, you're a stubborn
pain in the ass, you know that?

316
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,405
- Well, that's why you love me.
- Not so much right now.

317
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,541
You're the one who said to do
something good with
my Christmas app money.

318
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:54,045
I said give it to charity.
We're not a charity!

319
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:59,083
I never said you
were a char...! God, you make it
really hard, Jo, you know that?

320
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm not trying to make it hard,
I swear. But, please, Teddy,

321
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,857
understand,
we can't just take...

322
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,460
- Borrow. Just borrow.
- No, it's "take"
if we can't pay it back,

323
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,495
I don't know how we'll ever
be able to pay it back.

324
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:15,566
I know that your heart is in
exactly the right place, but,

325
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:21,339
- please understand...
- I... it's fine. I got it. OK?

326
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:26,877
But you damn well better
say yes to me painting
and sanding floors.

327
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,747
By hand, apparently.

328
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,455
- What?
- Just the idea of you sanding.

329
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,391
- Hm... that's funny.
- It's funny.

330
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:44,795
It's just like your hands...
[laughs]

331
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,066
- No, no! [laughs]
- Yeah!

332
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:53,437
[piano plays]

333
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,899
[whispers] Don't disturb her.

334
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,503
She's gotten so good.

335
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,972
I know. I thought about
giving her the piano.

336
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:32,877
I don't play it much anymore.
But then I realized that
would be depriving myself

337
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,896
- [electrical fizzling]
- [shrieks]

338
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,099
Hey, Natalia, what's up?

339
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,571
That sounds intriguing.

340
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:41,679
Yes. Of course.
I would love to write
your autobiography.

341
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,982
[gasps, mouthing]

342
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,786
Meet with your editor?
Yes, of course.

343
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,795
OK, bye!

344
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:01,232
- [laughing]
- What's the dance party for?

345
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:06,270
I got a writing gig. A big, fat,
real book writing gig.

346
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:11,141
- Your novel?
- Natalia's autobiography!

347
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,877
That's amazing! Oh, my gosh!

348
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,815
- Dancing!
- Oh! Work it out!

349
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:21,185
[stammers] What's that smell?
Is something burning?

350
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,655
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Amy?

351
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,558
- Amy! Amy!
- [coughing]

352
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,528
[all shouting]

353
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,700
You set the house on fire.
All the water damage
in the basement!

354
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,737
- Amy, what were you thinking?
- I was thinking I was
going to replace the fuse box.

355
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:42,273
- But we agreed.
- You agreed. I didn't.

356
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,746
The important thing is not to
have something that everybody
needs to be OK about!

357
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:51,549
- It was an accident, Jo!
- An accident is a mistake.

358
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,618
It's not an accident
when you do something
that people tell you not to do.

359
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,887
Who says that you get
to tell me to do anything?

360
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,925
Clearly, I can't.
And I'm not gonna tell you
to do anything anymore.

361
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,927
I will not speak to you, OK?

362
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,162
- Jo...
- Jo!

363
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,565
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

364
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,301
You let her cool off,
and then you can suck up
to her later, OK?

365
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:14,038
I'm not sucking up to her.
She can suck up to me.

366
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,874
And you wonder why you're
not treated like an adult?

367
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:21,745
What does this have to do
with being the youngest, Amy?

368
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,281
You almost burned down
our family home.

369
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:28,686
We've got the right
to be angry right now, not you.

370
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,193
Hey, did you get
my text earlier?

371
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:40,598
Um, call me back
when you get this, please.

372
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,706
I heard what happened.

373
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,275
- You OK?
- Yeah.

374
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,949
I'm just shaken up, I guess.

375
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,086
Won't you need electricity
to hang the Christmas lights?

376
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,322
Yes.

377
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,825
I hadn't thought of that.

378
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,829
God, that could
have been really bad.

379
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,798
- Why doesn't Amy get that?
- Because...

380
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,303
...as she never hesitates
to remind any of us, she's 20.

381
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,973
- She knows everything.
- [chuckles]

382
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:28,646
- in the name of helpfulness.
- No. Not us.

383
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:33,851
- Hanging protest banners
from the roof.
- That wasn't me.

384
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,820
- Nobody can prove that was me.
- Except me. I have pictures.

385
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:40,090
- You do?
- Of course I do.

386
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:44,061
What do you think,
we broke up and I erased you?

387
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,696
Wouldn't that be
easier in some ways?

388
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,198
You know, you break up
and press delete,

389
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,101
and then everything's gone.

390
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,304
I wouldn't want that.

391
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,841
Do you want to forget?

392
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,778
Well, I would like to forget

393
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,713
some of the things
that I said to you.

394
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:07,017
- In the end, you know?
- No.

395
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:13,390
I needed to figure out what
I wanted and go after it.

396
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,994
Have you?

397
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,231
Yes.

398
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,068
[phone vibrates]

399
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,304
Dan, isn't it?

400
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,707
Yeah, but I can call him back.

401
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,844
No. Answer it.
Tell him I said hi.

402
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:40,250
Hey.

403
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,295
It works. Great.

404
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,471
This is a little
lawyer-interview-suit-y,
but it's, I don't know,

405
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:05,442
- better than what you have.
- Honestly, try to make it back
without ruining it, please.

406
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,912
You realize if we
put your closet on eBay,
we'd be covered.

407
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,949
OK, yeah, this looks a little
less masculine writer,

408
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:15,919
a little, you know,
I don't know.
But I think I'm good to go.

409
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,023
Oh, my God.
No. Take that off.

410
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,959
Is someone talking?
'Cause I don't hear anyone.

411
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:25,229
- All right.
- Jo, she's trying to help.

412
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,371
[Beth] Wow, OK. I like...

413
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:38,876
- I like that color.
- Oh, my God.
You are not wearing that.

414
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,111
This is loose.
I always wear boots.

415
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,380
- She always wears boots.
- Put these on.

416
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,249
Definitely heels...

417
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,152
...on an interview.

418
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,391
All right.

419
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:59,129
Wow! I can't believe we were
gonna let her leave the house
in that other outfit.

420
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,931
- So much better.
- Yeah.

421
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,268
- Really? Really?
- Yeah. You look amazing.

422
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:09,006
- [laughter]
- So we're good now?

423
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,008
- No.
- Jo!

424
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,445
- [Jo] House on fire!
- Unbelievable.

425
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,915
Give her time.

426
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,527
[indistinct chatter]

427
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:34,565
Yeah, no, I'm glad we're...
I'm gonna have to call you back.

428
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:38,001
My appointment's here.
Yeah. I'll call you back.

429
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,376
@Nataliaforreal?
Is that you?

430
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,313
Uh, @Seanbr91 at the moment,

431
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,182
tweeting from my work
at an orphanage in Haiti.

432
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:56,420
Natalia's on the West Coast,
so I won't be hashtagging her
for another few hours.

433
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:59,456
- She's not an early riser.
- Right.

434
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,193
- @MarchJosephine.
- The voice behind the tweeters.

435
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,363
Tweets. They're called...
They're called tweets.

436
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,132
- Really?
- Yeah.

437
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,237
You're kind of
looking at me funny.

438
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,139
I guess I'm just trying
to reconcile how the person
who wrote those tweets

439
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:19,076
is the same woman who
is writing this compelling
historical novel

440
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:24,514
about four generations
of women growing up in
an old New England house.

441
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,950
My novel?
How the hell did you get that?

442
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:31,221
You submitted your
Natalia twitter feed
and this manuscript.

443
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,357
Oh, my God.

444
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,026
That was an accident.
Oh, my God!

445
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:41,965
Yeah. Was I not
supposed to read the
writing sample you sent to me?

446
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,968
I... I didn't... I...

447
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,072
Um, I'm so...
I'm so mortified right now.

448
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:53,243
Can we just focus
on the autobiography?

449
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,117
- The paycheck makes me care.
- But it shouldn't.

450
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,154
She's a pop star. She's 19.
Arguably, probably a very nice
person, and talented, but...

451
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,628
Um, why, do you want
to publish this?

452
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,497
I don't.

453
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,265
I'm very confused right now.

454
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,534
When I first took this job
they told me I could take

455
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,202
this place in
a more literary direction.

456
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,538
But, strangely,
books that are enjoyable,

457
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,408
books that mean something,
they don't keep the doors open.

458
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,011
So here I am, editing a cash cow
of an auto-biography

459
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,682
in the hopes that, one day,
I actually get to do
something meaningful.

460
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,484
- Exactly.
- What?

461
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:38,322
Cash, Mr. Bhaer.
I need the cash.

462
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:42,125
I don't know. I guess
I just thought the person
who wrote this

463
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,561
was aspiring for something more.

464
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,033
Well, don't get on me
for selling my soul

465
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,035
when yours
has already been purchased.

466
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,538
Jo.

467
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,976
Jo... you're right.

468
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,043
And I'm sorry.

469
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,678
Those of us without souls

470
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,046
should not be so critical.

471
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,615
- I still have the job?
- Yes.

472
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,289
Normally I would turn you
down in a fit
of righteous indignation,

473
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:19,096
Well, if I have to publish crap
then you're just the woman
to write it for me.

474
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,732
Outline by next week,
manuscript by December 20th.

475
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,267
That's six weeks away.

476
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,075
You made me a vision board.

477
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,645
With your vision of what
I should be doing.

478
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,682
But... I have a special twist
on this one.

479
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:43,387
Great, special twist.
Holding my breath.

480
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,091
Another board
of things I'll never do.

481
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,360
OK. But do you see how
this one is in black and white?

482
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:56,099
- I do, I do see that.
- That's 'cause you get
to color it in, with these!

483
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:59,503
- OK.
- This is an achievement board.

484
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:02,305
It's how you make
the vision a reality.

485
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,609
So every time you accomplish
something that's on the board,

486
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:10,514
like, um, write an essay for
a grad school application,

487
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:13,116
or, you know, you apply
for a grant, then...

488
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,652
Let me guess,
you have them listed too.

489
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,254
I do. Yeah.

490
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,256
So you do it,
you color it in,

491
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,358
and then when you're done,
you're left with this

492
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,329
beautiful, swirly pattern
of accomplishments.
It feels so good.

493
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,099
- Wow.
- Yeah.

494
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:33,136
- Wow!
- Well, I'm really glad
that you're wowed, Beth,

495
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,405
because I just really
do think that it's time.

496
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,676
- Time?
- For you to move out,
move on, next steps.

497
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,181
So I will just
let you start then.

498
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:48,118
The first thing that you
would color in is
"receive board from Meg."

499
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,621
Right there.

500
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,591
Red. Red's good. OK.

501
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,494
- Yay, red! [laughs]
- Yay, red!

502
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,529
Yay, red.

503
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,341
Look, if you're just gonna be
whining the whole time

504
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,678
that you're not sitting
under palm trees, then...

505
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,180
Can you hold on?
Hold on one sec,

506
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,315
I got another call.

507
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,217
There isn't another call,

508
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,321
- is there?
- You don't get it.

509
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:28,492
No, I don't.

510
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:30,861
But Dan's coming
for Thanksgiving?

511
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:35,232
- That's great.
- You don't think that.

512
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,205
What?

513
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,474
Hey, sorry, I'm back.

514
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,577
[chuckles] That was funny.

515
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,248
[phone rings]

516
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,238
- Teddy Lawrence!
- You don't have to yell.

517
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,309
How else am I gonna get you to
get it through your thick head
that you can't buy...

518
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,511
- I did not buy.
- ...charge....

519
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,914
I did not charge.
I borrowed.

520
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,249
This is
the Simpson's power washer,

521
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:29,352
the Englert's saw,
the Lerner's sander.

All sitting in their garages
begging for us to use them.

523
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:37,794
Oh, my God. So perfect.

524
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,830
- I know.
- Why didn't I think of this?

525
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,467
Because I thought of it.
And I'm brilliant.

526
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,771
See, I'm not
completely useless.

527
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:58,915
- Where are you going?
- Getting to work. Come. Carry.

528
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,867
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

529
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,973
Natalia says
she thwarted a riot?

530
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:27,010
I'm selling my soul for this!

531
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,628
I do have
your first advance.

532
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,530
- Thank you.
- I wish it could be more.

536
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,004
Oh, my God,
what are you doing?!

537
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:31,074
- And the floors!
- I said I was going
to do the floors.

538
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,410
- Hey.
- Look at this!
Look what she's done!

539
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,778
- Let me talk.
- No!

540
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,713
You know, Jo,
I knew you were gonna do this.

541
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,882
- Do what? You're the one who...
- Who found the hardwood

542
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,951
under the crappy linoleum
and the hidden fireplace?!

543
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,425
How are we going
to fix this too? I can't.

544
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:59,369
when this is sanded
and stained and sealed,
this could look really good.

545
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:05,975
OK, I have preprogrammed all my
tweets for the next few days.

546
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:09,079
I am officially going off the

uncle's going to say.

549
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,922
No. Be a man.

I have a book to write,
and my jobs to keep up with,

565
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:40,637
and a house that's getting worse
and worse. I can't do it all.

566
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,674
- You don't have to do it
all by yourself, Jo.
- Really?

567
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:54,217
It was a great idea.
It was a fantastic idea,
like all your ideas.

- You ruined everything!
- I didn't do anything.

Don't lie on top
of everything else!
You tweeted as Natalia.

- What's going on?
- Go on, tell Beth

00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,794
how you ruined our chance
to keep our home.

Tell her why we're
losing our home!

I was angry, all right?
You weren't talking to me.

602
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:26,135
So you go and do this? You ruin
everything I've ever worked for!

603
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,204
You don't even care
about this! Why don't
you go write your book!

604
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:31,174
Well, Amy, I can't afford
to think like that!

605
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:34,978
And if you weren't such
a spoiled little brat,
maybe you'd understand that.

606
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,682
How could you do
something like that?

607
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,018
- Leave her alone, Meg.
- It's not a big deal.

608
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,687
No, Amy, it's disloyal.

609
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:48,057
And something like this
can never be un-done.

610
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,293
Ever.

00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,734

00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:02,405

have wanted this.

00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,946

00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,918
It's gonna be OK.

617
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,261
- OK, careful, careful, careful!
- We know to be careful.

618
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,896
You don't need
to tell us to be careful.

619
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,165
We shouldn't even be
doing this ourselves.

620
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,335
Well, we can't afford not
to do it ourselves,
thanks to Amy.

621
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,070
OK, so what we are
gonna we do now?

622
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,673
You're so good at figuring
everything else out,

623
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,908
Meg, I'm sure you can figure
that out all by yourself.

624
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,176
- Beth, please!
- What?

625
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,011
Guys, maybe I could rig
something and...

626
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,714
No! We are not
doing this half-assed!
We're not rigging!

627
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:48,151
Everything she touches turns
into a hazard zone.
No more rigging!

628
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,787
[Mr. Lawrence] Girls,
dinnertime!

00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:52,755
- [all] Not hungry!
- Come on in here!

630
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,291
It's Thanksgiving,
I brought dinner!

631
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:59,762
Come on, or I'm gonna
call your mother
and tell her everything!

632
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:02,231
Right this way.

633
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,436
Sit wherever you like.

634
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:09,405
It's so beautiful, Mr. L.

635
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:17,714
But we thought, you know,
if this is gonna be your last
Thanksgiving in this house,

636
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:21,451
we wanted it to
be one to remember.

637
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:25,321
Well, the plan wasn't to have
it be our last Thanksgiving,

638
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:28,157
but Amy pretty much
ruined that.

639
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,293
- That's not fair.
- She just does whatever
she wants,

640
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:33,329
without thinking about
how it's going to turn out
for anyone else.

641
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:36,933
Just, enough already.
Please, both of you, enough!

642
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,102
At least I am who I am.

643
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,938
You hide, pretending to be
other people all the time.

644
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,373
Who I am is earning a living
for you, apparently.

645
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,510
- Can you pass the croissants?
- If you're serious about
actually earning a living, Jo,

646
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,445
maybe you'd call back that
editor who keeps calling here

647
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,814
- and leaving messages
every five seconds.
- And tell him what?

648
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:55,151
My sister is a slut
who posted naked pictures
and ruined my life?

649
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:59,922
OK, that's enough.
You both have rooms,
why don't you go to them,

650
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,291
and cool off.

651
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:06,129
Come back when
you're ready to eat.

652
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,969
I know. I promise you
we will not eat without them.

653
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:20,409
I have a little
surprise for you.

654
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,913
- Close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?

655
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,486
OK.

656
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,458
Oh, Beth, this is amazing!

657
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,362
Oh, my gosh!
I don't understand...

658
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:41,964
- I want you to have it.
- [laughs]

659
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,267
Just think of it as an
early Christmas present.

660
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:48,838
I can't... I can't believe this!
Mr. L, I can't...

661
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,573
- I can't believe you did this!
- Oh...

662
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:56,279
[playing classical music]

663
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:13,456
[squeaking]

664
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,608
Hey. Uh, you want to come over?

665
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,510
I'm sulking.

666
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,946
Seriously, Teddy, you don't
want to be around me right now.

667
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:41,183
Jo, come on.
It's freezing.

668
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:44,287
This might be our last
Thanksgiving here. Please.

669
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:48,691
Hurry, I'm so cold.
Take that, yes. Thank you.

670
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,995
[piano continues]

671
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,268
Hey. Where is everybody?

672
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,437
I don't know.

673
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:10,313
[moaning]

674
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,122
No! This is my parent's room!

675
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,592
I have good college
memories of this room.

676
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,602
And voila!

677
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:38,040
You've gotta be kidding me.

678
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:41,243
What? We always decorate our
tree the day after Thanksgiving.

679
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:46,282
- What is it, 12:01?
- Yep, so I'm right on time.

680
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,520
Teddy, I don't know.

681
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:54,557
Remember these? The weird
Shrinky Dink ones we made

682
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,759
- when we got loaded
in high school?
- Please, stop.

683
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:05,601
It's so screwed up and awful.
[sighs]

684
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:11,607
Hey. Can I remind you
how much you hated Natalia?

685
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:15,578
- But I liked having a job.
- You'll have another job.

686
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:22,752
There is nothing that
you cannot do, Jo March.

687
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:26,789
- Except for earning a living.
- Except for that.

688
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,788
Oh, gosh! Teddy, Teddy, Teddy!

689
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:04,126
- Oh! No, don't!
- You kissed me...

690
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:08,264
- You did.
- I didn't mean to. I'm...

691
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:11,567
It's so late, and I think
that we should just...

692
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,203
We should go to bed
and then we can decorate

693
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:18,274
the Christmas tree in the
morning and we'll just
pretend this didn't happen.

694
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,543
I don't want to do that.

695
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:24,413
Yeah, you do.

696
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,449
I love you, Jo.

697
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,720
No. No, you don't.

698
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,358
You're the one for me.

699
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,395
OK? You've always
been the one for me.
You are my best friend.

700
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:43,365
You're my best friend,
Teddy, but...

701
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,501
...I don't...

702
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:47,436
I don't feel
that way about you.

703
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:53,676
And I just really don't think
you feel that way about me.

704
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:58,114
- I don't believe you.
- Teddy...

705
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,350
You have to.

706
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:09,859
There's someone else,
isn't there?

707
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:12,828
- Of course not.
- No.

708
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,866
There has to be.
Something has changed.

709
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:19,768
Teddy, listen to me.

710
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,173
I don't want you to be upset.

711
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,375
And this doesn't
have to ruin our friendship.

712
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:30,146
I don't want friendship.
I want more.

713
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,651
I don't.

714
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:40,189
Teddy. Teddy!

715
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,758
Teddy, where are you going?

716
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:20,329
Teddy! Teddy!

717
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,866
Let's go get drunk.

718
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,603
[music plays]

719
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,842
- How you guys doing?
- Good.

720
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,845
- Could I just see
your ID, please?
- Yeah.

721
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,714
Come on, man,
it's the holidays.

722
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,216
No, it's fine.

723
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:42,985
Happy birthday.

724
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,521
- How about a birthday shot?
- Yeah.

725
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:50,659
Everybody was
a little bit distracted

726
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,461
by how pissed off
they are at me,

727
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:54,430
so I'm not really
expecting a birthday party.

728
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:59,435
- But I'm expecting you to buy.
- Ha.

729
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,437
Of course you are.

730
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,240
Thank you.

731
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,379
Happy birthday... to me!

732
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:16,552
I sorry, I can't...
get over the fact that I
feel like I'm corrupting you.

733
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,864
What happened
to you two tonight anyway?

734
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:33,502
You didn't actually tell her
how you really feel, did you?

735
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:36,739
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, I did.

736
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:43,545
Oh, I think you already
know the answer to that one.

737
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,848
To you March sisters.
Under my skin,

738
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:50,352
part of my stupid
heart and soul.

739
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:59,061
There is nothing stupid
about love, Teddy.

740
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,731
Nothing at all.

741
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,510
You did promise.

742
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,912
I can't believe you
remember that.

743
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:19,648
I was... I was 12 years old,

744
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,318
and miserable about
the way my front teeth looked

745
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,687
and this super cute
high school senior guy

746
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:29,658
promises he's gonna kiss me?
I mean, like that's not
a pivotal moment.

747
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,528
Seriously?

748
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:39,635
Well, I mean, then you
started calling me Chicklet,

749
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:41,737
and all your friends did.

750
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:45,808
And so my crush
just went... Ooh!

751
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,682
No more Chicklet, I swear.

752
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,918
Thank you.

753
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,426
- Oh, no. We're not doing that.
- Yeah. No.

754
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:06,662
- 'Cause that's...
- Cliche.

755
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:09,865
- ...bad habit.
- And, um, yeah...

756
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,735
I think I just drunkenly...

757
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:14,470
...tried to make good
on my promise.

758
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:17,005
I mean, when you do kiss me,
I want it to be...

759
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,042
- When I...
- If.

760
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:24,480
It can't be while I'm on the
rebound from your sister?

761
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:27,883
- I really need a drink. Now.
- Yeah...

762
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:31,086
I'm gonna get you a beer
at my house. [laughs]

763
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:34,123
And you better
keep your hands off.

764
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,958
- OK. I'm good.
- I'm just...

765
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,794
- Mm! This way.
- I'm not...

766
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,804
[car approaching]

767
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,518
Oh!

768
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,963
Well, that didn't take long.

769
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:18,901
Oh, no! We didn't...
This is not what you think.

770
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:22,938
It never is. I was up
all night worried about you.

771
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,541
[moans] Good.
You should be.

772
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:28,577
- Jo, we just had a couple...
- Get out. There's someone
at the door for me.

773
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:32,614
- Someone who's important to me.
- Oh, really? Who would that be?

774
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,883
- Why do you care?
- Why wouldn't I?

775
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,718
- He's my editor.
- Oh.

776
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,822
- [doorbell rings]
- OK. I'll get it.

777
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,857
- Teddy, get out.
- No, it's really...

778
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,959
- Stop! Get out!
- It's not a big deal.

779
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,961
Why are you doing this? Stop!

780
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
- Oh, hi!
- Marcus, hi.

781
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:58,907
- Maybe kind of.
- Oh, it's a great time.
It's a wonderful time.

782
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:02,010
- Sorry, what was your name?
- Uh, Marcus. And you're...

783
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,546
Just the boy next door.
And I apologize.

784
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:06,114
We got sort of a late start
this morning. Come on in.

785
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,851
- Maybe this was a bad idea.
- Showing up
on someone's doorstep

786
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,220
at 8:45 the morning
the day after Thanksgiving?

787
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:12,888
I personally think
that it's a novel idea.

788
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,823
I just, I happened
to be at my aunt's house

789
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,793
in Concord for Thanksgiving
dinner so I thought...

790
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:20,696
Really? Really?
Do we believe that?

791
00:58:20,698 --> 00:58:22,831
Teddy, if you're not going
to be helpful, shut up.

792
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,969
Oh, I can be helpful.
And useful. I'll go make coffee.

793
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:30,138
Jo, lots of cream,
way too much sugar,
that I know. Marcus?

794
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,775
- Huh? Uh, black.
- OK, I'll be right back.

795
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:37,646
- But don't be going anywhere.
- I wouldn't dare.

796
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:42,985
I'm so sorry, he's untrained
and I'm not dressed.

797
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:45,187
- I sort of noticed that.
- [laughs]

798
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,890
I didn't need you to come all
the way over here to let me
know that I screwed up.

799
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:50,125
- I know why Natalia fired me.
- That's not why I'm here.

800
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:54,663
- It's not?
- No, it's not.
Actually, I'm here for this.

801
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,136
What are you doing?

802
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:04,973
[stammers]
Oh, I'm making coffee.

803
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:07,743
No. You are not.

804
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,916
I don't know, Teddy.

805
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:19,054
You corrected my not-novel.

806
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,290
This is like getting a "D"
in English lit all over again.

807
00:59:21,292 --> 00:59:23,992
I didn't correct it.
I edited it.

808
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,627
What?

809
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,329
I want to work
on this with you.

810
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:30,165
I wanna get a couple sample
chapters and give them
to my boss.

811
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:33,302
- Seriously?
- Yes, this is the kind of book
I wanna work on.

812
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:36,905
This is the reason I took the
job, this is what I want
to persuade them to do.

813
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,642
- I love this.
- But what about
@Nataliaforreal?

814
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:41,910
I'm not interested in her.

815
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,614
What I am interested in
is @MarchJosephine.

816
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,117
Sorry I took so long.

817
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,054
You guys go... [sighs]

818
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,659
So, what happens from here?

819
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:01,196
Well, I'm a good editor,
but I gotta tell you that
I don't pull any punches, OK?

820
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:05,334
This needs a lot of work.
Unfortunately, I don't have
any money for an advance.

821
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,703
And I really don't
deal well with tears.

822
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:11,640
[grunts] Tears?

823
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:13,075
I'm sorry,
have you met this woman?

824
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:14,276
- Teddy.
- She's heartless.

825
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:17,112
- Shut up.
- OK.

826
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:21,016
All right, why don't you
look that over, and then
if you want to work together,

827
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:24,319
- we should probably start soon.
- What about tomorrow?

828
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:28,023
Tomorrow it is.
Thanks for the coffee.

829
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:32,094
- You're welcome.
- Go home, Teddy.

830
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,099
[loud crashing]

831
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,638
Oh, my God! Amy! Oh, my God!

832
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,874
Oh, my God!
Get it off of her!

833
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,909
- Please!
- [Meg] Beth, call 911!

834
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:50,746
- Teddy, grab the other side.
- Amy, can you hear me?

835
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,048
I can't believe she tried
to move this by herself!

836
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,251
Oh, God, the phone! The phone
won't work down here!

837
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,323
Amy, if you can hear me,
squeeze my hand.
Oh, my God, Amy.

838
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:05,927
- Listen to me.
- Jo, it's all right. OK?
She's going to be fine.

839
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:09,097
Why don't...
Just go talk to her.

840
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,872
- What do we do?
- Amy.

841
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:20,242
If this is you not talking
to me because we're fighting,
you're not playing fair.

842
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:23,111
Amy, please!

843
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,459
- I can walk.
- I know you can,
just let me do this.

844
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:46,435
The doctor told us to watch over
her very closely
for the next 24 hours.

845
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:51,473
Because that's what I need,
for you guys to draw on my face
while I sleep.

846
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:55,043
No, Amy, this might be one of
the only times that it's OK
for us to treat you

847
01:01:55,045 --> 01:02:00,182
- like a baby, OK?
- Hey. Don't ever
do that to me again.

848
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:07,789
when we were
fighting like that...

849
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,193
I know you love me, Jo.

850
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:16,064
Even when you want
to kill me, I know.

851
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,941
- Should we talk about...?
- [phone vibrates]

852
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,744
Sorry.

853
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:35,217
No, it's OK, take it.
You should tell him she's OK.

854
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:38,420
- Tell who?
- Dan.

855
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:42,424
No, that wasn't Dan.
We broke up.

856
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,870
[sighs]

857
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:58,340
[all] Happy birthday, Amy!

858
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:01,777
Now you can use your real ID!

859
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:05,046
- I thought you guys forgot.
- Come on, never!

860
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:06,915
Where's Teddy?

861
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:09,951
He'll be by later.

862
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:15,056
- Give me a wish!
-   <i>♪ Amy makes</i>
<i>the world go round ♪</i>

863
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,393
[cheering, laughing]

864
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:21,163
[playing soft music]

865
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:26,101
I hate that Mom and Dad are
going to come home and we'll
have made this place worse

866
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:30,238
- than it was when they left.
- No, that's not gonna happen.

867
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,810
- Why?
- 'Cause they put me in charge.

868
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,012
Oh, Beth, that reminds me.

869
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:40,916
Where are you on that
Julliard application?

870
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,121
Just because Mom put you
in charge of the house

871
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:48,256
does not mean you're
in charge of my life.

872
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,193
Beth, if you would just
listen to me for five minutes,
all I'm trying...

873
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:56,998
- [overlapping chatter]
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

874
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,203
I know that I'm letting you down
and, trust me,

875
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:04,940
I hate that I'm
letting you down,
but I'm not Juilliard Girl.

876
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:09,978
I am not Philharmonic girl.
And I am definitely not the girl
who gets the grants!

877
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,914
- Who says?
- My teachers,
my college evaluations.

878
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,016
Basically, everyone!

879
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:25,460
- Snow!
- Are you seeing snow?
Do we need to call the doctor?

880
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,996
[Amy] No... Look at the window.

881
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,866
Wow! Look, look!

882
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:33,535
Hey, I wanna see.

883
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:38,139
- [laughing]
- I love the first snow.

884
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,075
- Mm-hm.
- It makes it seem like

885
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:42,944
- everything's going
to be all right.
- Mm-hm.

886
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:47,415
- That's what Mom always says.
- Yeah.

887
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,918
Do you guys remember
when we were little
and she would wake us up

888
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,187
in the middle of the night
so we could go outside
to drink cocoa?

889
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,190
- Yeah!
- Do you remember how
upset she would get

890
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,925
when Teddy and I would
start a snowball fight?

891
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:58,627
- Yeah.
- It was annoying.

892
01:04:58,629 --> 01:05:02,597
- No, it wasn't!
- And then she'd win.

893
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:06,167
Which she almost always did.

894
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:12,908
This can't to be our last
Christmas at Orchard House.

895
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,533
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

896
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:42,404
I just wanted to check in
and see if you needed anything.

897
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:45,941
No, I'm good.
But thanks for checking.

898
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:49,077
You're good? Come on, Meg...

899
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,446
They're cold in there
and I said I'd make them...

900
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:55,517
- Stop.
- [laughs] OK.

901
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,586
I have something
I need to say.

902
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:01,323
OK.

903
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,459
It's you and me, Meg.

904
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,262
- It's always been you and me.
- John...

905
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:13,635
And even if you tell me
to go away right now,
it'll still be you and me.

906
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,571
I love you.

907
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,974
I know this is fast.

908
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:23,078
I don't want to waste
another moment with us
not being together.

909
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,581
- John... [gasps]
- This was my grandmother's.

910
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:30,051
Maybe you want something new,
and if you do, I promise you
I'll buy that for you.

911
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:33,088
[sobbing] John, stop!
Oh, my God!

912
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:38,093
I'm... I'm not the same
person that I was in college.

913
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:41,463
I'm not even the same person
that I was two months ago.

914
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:45,633
And I don't need
a big diamond at all.

915
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:49,371
I... I just need you.

916
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:53,308
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

917
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:01,383
- Marry me, Meg March.
- I will.

918
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:12,193
Meg, what is taking so...?

919
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:17,232
Don't mind me.
You can just keep kissing.

920
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:20,668
No, Jo, don't.
Jo, wait! I have a question.

921
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,539
How do you feel about, um,

922
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,575
really ugly dresses
that you can't wear again?

923
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,078
I hate them. Why?

924
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:37,452
- [laughs]
- So I'm really happy

925
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:40,055
to see the end
of Douche Bag Dan.

926
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:48,063
What?! Welcome to the family!

927
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:07,482
- You never forget, do you?
- Never.

928
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,632
It's blank.

929
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:27,202
Do whatever you want.

930
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:30,605
Just don't leave it blank, OK?

931
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,142
OK.

932
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,453
Well, I was thinking
of cutting it. That part.

933
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:53,795
Um... it's a little
too weird maybe?

934
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:56,264
Orchard House itself
is a voice in the story.

935
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:59,534
Yes, it is a little weird,
but it's good weird.

936
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:02,337
- It's compelling weird.
- So, what's the problem?

937
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:05,273
You.
You're doubting yourself,

938
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:08,543
and it's showing through
in the writing.
So don't doubt this.

939
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,778
And don't doubt you.

940
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,414
It's kind of hard
not to doubt myself

941
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,750
when there's more red ink
on the page than black ink.

942
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:20,722
Look, Jo, this is who you
are underneath the Jo
you show the rest of the world.

943
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:24,759
It's not Natalia,
it's not Sean, it's not Curtis.

944
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,294
This is you.

945
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:29,898
And I kind of like
getting to know you.

946
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,734
I'm betting the rest
of the world will too.

947
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,804
I just...
I don't know what to say.

948
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:41,242
- I'm not done.
- I'm sure you're not.

949
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:44,779
But I have to go.
My sister's play opens tonight

950
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:49,551
and I am blood-bound
to give the props mistress's
assistant a standing ovation.

951
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,619
- What play?
-  <i>Twelfth Night.</i>

952
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:54,923
Ah, yes. "With adoration,
with fertile tears,

953
01:09:54,925 --> 01:09:58,960
with groans that thunder love,
with sighs of fire."

954
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:01,930
- You know it?
- Absolutely.

955
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:05,233
You mind if I come?

956
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,880
[indistinct chatter]

957
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,817
- Hello, Beth!
- Hello.

958
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:26,621
- Mr. Lawrence!
- The lovely Miss Meg March,
ladies and gentlemen.

959
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:29,958
Well, not "Miss"
for very much longer.

960
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,994
- [laughter]
- Wow. I'm impressed.

961
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:36,364
- Oh, thank you!
- Congratulations!

962
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:37,932
That's a very good man
you have here.

963
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,300
- Thank you.
- Yes, he is.

964
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,502
Thumbs up.

965
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,473
Poor Teddy.

966
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:47,442
- Hey.
- We're gonna go sit.

967
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,715
- Can we sit here?
- We saved these.

968
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,750
- You did? Great.
- Yes.

969
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:03,324
Uh, I wanted to see the view
from behind the scenes.

970
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:06,027
- You're spying on Jo,
aren't you?
- Yeah.

971
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:11,366
Why? You knew she'd be
here. Why'd you come?

972
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:13,735
'Cause I promised you I would.

973
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:16,904
And I've been trying to keep
all my promises these days.

974
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:20,675
Plus, I didn't realize

but I can't. I'm not ready.

1138
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:59,226
[laughs] Oh, God!

1139
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:02,362
Love is so stupid.

1140
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,366
But I think that I'm in it.

1141
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:12,573
So then what are you
doing here? Go.

1142
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,643
Go.

1143
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,189
Aren't you supposed to be
surrounded by your friends
and family,

1144
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:31,325
watching a Yule log
burn or something?

1145
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:40,601
...I suddenly got this urge
to have scallion pancakes,
with you.

1146
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:43,137
You know, I was going to
call you after the holiday.

1147
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:45,739
I'm sure you say that
to all the girls.

1148
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:49,710
I have good news.
My boss likes the chapters.

1149
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,693
What are you doing?
Don't you have anything to say?

1150
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,397
It's a lot easier
when I write it down

1151
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:11,932
and then you scribble
all over it with red pen

1152
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:14,635
and tell me what I was
really trying to say, OK?

1153
01:26:14,637 --> 01:26:16,303
Oh, right.

1154
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,585
We did.

1155
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:52,573
Let me see the chalk.

1156
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,986
I think it reads
better like that, don't you?

1157
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:10,757
What about Teddy?

1158
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,927
He's the boy next door.

1159
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:20,267
Well, then, Merry Christmas,
