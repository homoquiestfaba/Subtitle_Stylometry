1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,458
All right, you monkeys.

2
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:09,020
Today we will learn an exercise
called a squat thrust.

3
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:13,056
We will learn how to do this exercise
in the proper manner,

4
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:17,094
or I will personally chew
some asses off.

5
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:20,107
All right,
on the whistle blow.

6
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:33,214
♫ Now here's a little song
about a thing called rage ♫

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,386
♫ And you're wondering
just how it feels... ♫

8
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,622
Squat, thrust.
Squat, thrust...

9
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,335
Mr. Noland, what the hell
is going on back there?

10
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:54,000
Those were the lamest squat
thrusts I have ever seen

11
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:56,977
in my entire 10 years of high-school
gymnasium class coach.

12
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:59,980
Get your ass up
your front center, pronto.

13
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:02,039
Pronto, damn it.

14
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,677
Now you will do
a squat thrust

15
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,688
in the proper fashion,
in front of the entire class.

16
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:10,589
On the whistle blow.

17
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,321
Squat, thrust.
Squat, thrust...

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,031
♫ Don't let them get you down,
don't ever lose your glory ♫

19
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,093
♫ 'Cause the world's doped up,
and you're part of the song ♫

20
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:25,867
♫ So, let's all get in key
and we 1! all sing along ♫

21
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:30,537
♫ Yeah, we 1! all sing along ♫

22
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:33,240
♫ Yeah-ah... ♫

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,386
Squat, thrust.
Squat, thrust, squat--

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,546
(whistle blows)

25
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:43,751
Get up, you pathetic turd.

26
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,782
Get up.

27
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:51,296
Now I will demonstrate the proper
fashion in which to do this exercise.

28
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:53,732
Hold my clipboard,
if that's not too much to ask.

29
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:58,866
♫ Ain't got no daddy, my mama's
living off of government mail ♫

30
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:02,672
♫ But she is the one
that will decide ♫

31
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,941
♫ What's best for me,
while pills are keeping her high ♫

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,541
♫ Vlﬁth her and the school board
against me ♫

33
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:13,816
♫ They gave me test to see
just what they might see... ♫

34
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:15,846
Observe-- you're down,

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,155
extend, retract,
you're here.

36
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:22,560
You're down, extend,
retract, you're here.

37
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:24,588
Give me that clipboard, boy.

38
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,795
- Now do it on the whistle blow.
- Can't you give me a break?

39
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:31,032
Give you a break?
Give you a break?

40
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:34,803
Son, I never got any breaks
in life raised in Alabama.

41
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,369
12 years in the military,
I never got any breaks.

42
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:41,382
64-70 pick-up,
no breaks.

43
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,353
Now repeat after me--

44
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:59,298
I had a damn fine
gymnasium class coach.

45
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,233
I had a damn fine--

46
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:07,804
I had a damn fine
gymnasium class coach.

47
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:10,310
Now, then,
you will demonstrate

48
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:14,337
30 squat thrusts in the proper fashion,
in front of this class.

49
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:16,373
On the whistle blow.

50
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,544
(bell ringing)

51
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,949
I am the head
of the guidance department.

52
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,952
And my name...

53
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:32,697
is Mr. Korn.
Now, hold on.

54
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,669
I know what you're thinking.
You are thinking to yourselves,

55
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:39,195
“Oh, man, with a name like that,
this guy had best be down

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,401
with where my generation
is coming from, huh?

57
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,707
Otherwise, he is whack!“
( laughs )

58
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:47,112
Okay...

59
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:51,278
well, I'm gonna be taking over
this class for the next two weeks.

60
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,514
And I'll just be here to talk to you

61
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:56,990
about stuff
like college, and jobs...

62
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:00,425
and fun things like that.
Now i have an assignment for you.

63
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,894
i want you to write a paper.

64
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:03,863
it'll be due
at the end of two weeks.

65
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:06,799
But that's not your homework
for tonight. I know, I know.

66
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,860
Hold on! Let me get
a word in here, please.

67
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:13,431
Boo, grown up homework stuff.
I want you to help me out.

68
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:16,204
i want you to jot down some ideas
for tomorrow's class.

69
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:19,543
Like, where do you
see yourselves in 10 years?

70
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,310
Are you gonna be married?
Single?

71
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,682
You got kids?
What's your job like?

72
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,745
Are you gay? Straight?
Hooked on drugs? Sober?

73
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,088
Just give me the whole Iollapalooza.
( chuckles )

74
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:15,192
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:20,235
I was looking for that book.
Are you gonna check it out?

76
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:21,707
Maybe.

77
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,611
Okay.

78
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:29,779
I'm trying to find a topic
for my career paper.

79
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,409
Whatever.

80
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:36,045
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

81
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:10,219
- What the hell are you doing?
- Check this out, baby.

82
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,953
Very impressive.

83
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:14,985
Mr. Grimaldi made me do
30 squat-thrusts today.

84
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,497
That's the advantage
of being in Special Ed.

85
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:20,967
We don't have to take gym. It makes it
up for being with the retards all day.

86
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:24,460
Next year I'm gonna sign up with
the “retard" classes with you, but...

87
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:27,668
No, you don't wanna be doing that.
We got all the lame chicks.

88
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,073
You guys get all the hotties,

89
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,305
like that Sasha
you're always talking about.

90
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,074
Sasha seems like she's
into murder and stuff.

91
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:35,912
She was wearing a Charles Manson
t-shirt today in the library

92
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,578
and reading a book about killers.
So I got a bunch of them.

93
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,678
Chicks love these guys.

94
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,588
The Night Stalker, Richard Ramirez,
Ted Bundy--

95
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,455
they both married fans
while they were in prison.

96
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:48,587
I think you might be on
to something here, man.

97
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,620
(scream, explosion )

98
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:55,094
- Hi, babe.
- What are you cooking for dinner?

99
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,104
Very funny.

100
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,868
- So, how was school?
- Fine.

101
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:02,467
You got any tests or papers
coming up, Case?

102
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,570
You gotta get your grades up
if you're gonna get into a good college.

103
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:09,481
- Not this again, Mom.
- Just keep me posted, okay?

104
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:11,849
You never cared
before Dad died.

105
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:17,355
Now it's myjob to make sure
you get everything done.

106
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,586
So just give me a break, okay?

107
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,698
♫ She swam to me, yeah... ♫

108
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,401
TV host:
Hi, I'm J. D. Rock.

109
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:37,036
You may remember me as the host
of the game show Fun House.

110
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:40,479
You wanna make more money?
Heck, we all do.

111
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,482
Call now for a free brochure

112
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:46,043
and how to earn a degree in auto
mechanics, real estate, or computers--

113
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,750
Worried about not having your high-
school diploma, but you like to travel?

114
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,588
Why not call JWA Transport?

115
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:56,494
And we'll get you
driving the big rigs.

116
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,931
When I graduated from high school,
I knew college wasn't for me.

117
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,095
That's why I went to the Tech Effects
Institute for Computers.

118
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:06,698
Police this morning found the body
of a local high school student.

119
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:10,734
He was with his girlfriend,
who officials claim is still missing.

120
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,508
Police have yet to release
the names of the victims,

121
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:16,880
but our sources tell us
that authorities are now considering

122
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:20,978
the recent murders to be the work
of a single serial killer--

123
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:25,322
Narrator: Theodore Robert Bundy
considered himself to be a predator.

124
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,350
He preyed on young women.

125
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,761
He murdered
at least 30 of them.

126
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:34,201
He told me, “I decided
to take the shortcut to be...

127
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,398
powerful and well known
and to be--

128
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:39,633
to make my mark
on the world.“

129
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:42,540
- I'll meet her.
- Man: They're all my children.

130
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,511
Anybody that's ever seen me
has followed my footsteps.

131
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,537
How else could they do
anything else?

132
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:15,700
♫ Toot-toot. ♫
I know my mind.

133
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,201
And I trust the very
same person that you do.

134
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:23,943
And the very same person
that you do.

135
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:26,475
I trust the only person
left to trust--

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,454
me.

137
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,957
( dog barking )

138
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,407
( barking continues )

139
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,847
Shh!

140
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:56,840
Would you please be quiet?

141
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,986
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

142
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:09,885
♫ Hey, you,
shut the fuck up! ♫

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,431
♫ Shut the fuck up! ♫

144
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:27,805
♫ Shut the fuck up! ♫

145
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,641
Goddamn dog.

146
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,676
Hey, I got those stickers
you asked for.

147
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,781
Oh, great.
This is gonna be awesome.

148
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:38,985
Man, you look burnt out.

149
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:41,551
Old man Cruder's new dog
woke me up again last night.

150
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,586
That goddamn dog
barks every night.

151
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:46,259
I mean, I know where--
I can get you some C-4,

152
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,063
we could shove it up
that puppy's ass

153
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,297
and blow that fucking mutt
to Delaware.

154
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:54,069
- Have you gone postal?
- No, but check this out.

155
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,668
Last night, I'm watching
the Jenny Jones Show, okay?

156
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,339
They got these supermarket employee
makeovers. Are you following me?

157
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,407
They take these fat ugly chicks

158
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,045
and turn them
into fat ugly chicks with makeup.

159
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,578
I mean, fucking those are
the people you gotta kill.

160
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,955
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Somebody's gotta clean up the crap.

161
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:14,517
- Man, just kill those motherfuckers.
- I hear you.

162
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,553
Hey, check this shit out.

163
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,861
Holy shit!

164
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,836
- That's disgusting.
- Serial killers struck again.

165
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:26,704
I've got the pictures to prove it.
Show and tell, baby.

166
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,435
Having a dad
as a police photographer

167
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:31,308
must make you the coolest
kid in Special Ed.

168
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,142
Nah.

169
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,809
Actually, this one chick's dad
is a drug dealer.

170
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,818
It kind of sucks.

171
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:43,152
♫ i needed you then,
i needed you then ♫

172
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,650
♫ i bet you know
i don't need you now ♫

173
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:51,529
♫ We were good friends, yes,
you know, we were good friends ♫

174
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:55,865
♫ But you know
you lost me somehow ♫

175
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:58,064
♫ it's a beautiful life ♫

176
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:59,868
♫ it's a world of delight... ♫

177
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:03,968
Okay, now if you'll all just pass
your outlines up front,

178
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:08,107
- we can read them aloud.
- Oh my God, how embarrassing.

179
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:12,051
Thank you,
and thank you.

180
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,515
Okay. Well, let's see
what we've got.

181
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,391
- Hey, Mr. “Pekela.“
- That's “Pekala.“

182
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:23,953
Mr. “Pekala.“

183
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:26,262
“In 10 years, I see myself

184
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,064
as a gynecologist,

185
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,936
because I feel
it's important for young girls

186
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:34,839
to have someone
to help them with their...

187
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,740
vaginal problems.“

188
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,938
That's “vaginal," Mr. “Picalla.“

189
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,072
Very funny.
Very funny.

190
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:43,675
Let's see... voila. Okay.

191
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,446
“In 10 years...

192
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:49,820
I will be the CEO of Revlon.“
Marni Greenstein.

193
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:53,324
Well, that is very interesting,
Ms. Greenstein.

194
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,989
And I can see that clearly
you are off to a very good start.

195
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,261
You're so money.
You do know it.

196
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,102
Let's see what else
we have here.

197
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,539
Ah, Mr. Casey Noland.
“In 10 years,

198
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:10,407
i see myself
on death row...

199
00:13:10,444 --> 00:13:12,878
convicted...

200
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:17,213
of being the most notorious
serial killer in history.

201
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:22,518
They caught me after
i decapitated my gym teacher. "

202
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:25,457
Ew, what a psycho!

203
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:30,859
I don't find this very funny,
Mr. Noland.

204
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:33,458
And we're gonna wrap
about this after class.

205
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,799
All right.
We've read enough of these.

206
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:39,700
We 're gonna be
handing you out

207
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,573
the Life Goals Evaluations Test.

208
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:45,203
And this should give you

209
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:49,045
a pretty good idea
of the sorts of careers

210
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:53,213
and vocations
that will best suit you

211
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,222
and your personal ambitions.

212
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:58,816
You will need a #2 pencil.

213
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,226
Please don't go
outside the circles.

214
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,440
(crowd cheers, applauds)

215
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:11,454
Mr. Noland, you should know
that the use of CD players

216
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:14,262
- during school hours is forbidden.
- I was just listening to--

217
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,270
And you will excuse me
if I relieve you of this toxic--

218
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:20,137
pardon my French--
crap as well.

219
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:22,404
( bell ringing )

220
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,349
So, you like
Marilyn Manson?

221
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:42,962
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

222
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:45,989
I liked your career choice.

223
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:48,194
Thanks.

224
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,726
I'm gonna return that book
to the library this afternoon,

225
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:53,239
if you wanna check it out.
It'll be in.

226
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:57,107
- Yeah, thanks.
- That's no problem.

227
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:01,940
How cute.
Two freaks in love.

228
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,576
Thank you.
Mr. Noland...

229
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,279
I didn't find your paper
very amusing.

230
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,519
Killing people
isn't the bomb.

231
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:14,550
- It's just not funny.
- Depends on who you ask.

232
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,257
Now you listen to me.

233
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:20,357
If you want to pass this course,
you're gonna hand in another paper

234
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,801
besides this one and do it
properly this time. Do you understand?

235
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:25,737
Yes, sir.

236
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,831
And by the way...

237
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,905
thanks for the diet tip.

238
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:37,577
Oh, Marni.

239
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,984
Someone seems to have left
their jacket behind.

240
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,989
Would you do me a favor
and run it over to Lost and Found?

241
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:46,459
- But I'm gonna be late for gym class.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,342
Hello? Hello?

243
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,687
- ( screams )
- What the fuck are you doing here?

244
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:21,182
I am lost. I am trying
to find Lost and Found.

245
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,890
No, no, wait, wait.

246
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:28,095
Here, we keep that shit in here.

247
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,126
What you got there,
pretty girl?

248
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,900
Oh, it must have been expensive.

249
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,709
You are a pretty girl.

250
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:38,870
You wanna sit?

251
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:42,439
- I've got some beer in the fridge.
- No, thanks. I have to get to class.

252
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:45,042
Wait!
Where are you going?

253
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,656
The kid will learn his lesson, huh?
( spits )

254
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,467
They're ungrateful.

255
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,732
They're all ungrateful bastards
and bitches.

256
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,537
What you're gonna want
to ask yourself today,

257
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,738
is, “Can I hurl the plastic disc

258
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,509
in a fashion
that will please Mr. Grimaldi,

259
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,347
or will i hurl it
in an improper fashion

260
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,478
and displease Mr. Grimaldi,

261
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,512
thusly receiving a boot
upside my buttocks?"

262
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:25,787
I think you'll choose
the first option.

263
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:28,124
Take the disc

264
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:31,289
and hurl it to your neighbor
in the other line.

265
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:34,494
On the whistle blow.
And...

266
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,832
Good throw.
Good catch.

267
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,668
Good throw. Good catch.

268
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,697
Good throw.
Good catch.

269
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,733
Good throw. Good catch.

270
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,177
- Good--
- ( whistle blows)

271
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:50,081
Mr. Noland, what the Sam hell
is wrong with you, huh?

272
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:54,451
You can't even throw a plastic disc
like you don't squat to pee?

273
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,889
Try it again. And this time
throw it like you got a pair.

274
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:00,825
On the whistle blow.
And...

275
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,955
Did you try to hit me
with that plastic disc? Did you?

276
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,659
Did you try to express
your hatred for Mr. Grimaldi?

277
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,227
Well, if you did,
try it again.

278
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,034
And this time, throw it
like you got a pair of nuts.

279
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:16,736
Take the plastic disc.
Throw it at me. Do it.

280
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:19,439
Do it.
You pathetic turd.

281
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,970
I cannot believe
that you throw like a woman.

282
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:25,246
Well, We gotta get somebody
to teach you how to throw like a man.

283
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,277
Ms. Barman,
get your ass up here.

284
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:32,987
Take him over in the corner
and teach him how to throw like a man.

285
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,721
Do it now!

286
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:38,026
The rest of you
resume the activity.

287
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:41,626
You know, Mr. Noland,
if you continue in this fashion,

288
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:44,535
you'll be the first student
to ever fail gymnasium class

289
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:47,904
in the history of square buildings
with wooden floors.

290
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,603
The rest of you continue
on the whistle.

291
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:15,931
♫ At least the monkey
was my own I

292
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:19,496
♫ i let him go because
We grown... ♫

293
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,100
These kids are maggots. Fucking
tater tots all over the lunch room.

294
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:26,169
Goddamn kids.
Where are their fucking parents?

295
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,677
( alternative rock music playing )

296
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:36,656

you're very clever:

301
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:53,235
That's disgusting.

302
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,566
I think I'm gonna be sick.

303
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:04,478
I don't feel good.
I can't do this.

304
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:08,249
Mr. Horror Movies
is grossed out by a dead pig?

305
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:11,849
- I don't believe it.
- Can I go to the nurse?

306
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:15,123
Well, I have to fail you
if you don't complete this project.

307
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:17,494
Can I make it up
with extra credit?

308
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:21,194
Well... we'll work something out.
Yes, go. You go. Go ahead.

309
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,862
- Thanks, Mr. Rabino.
- It's the second door on the right.

310
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:26,202
No, the third door.

311
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:29,640
Mrs. Prisano.
Ah, she can handle it.

312
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,679
Keep cutting.
Very good.

313
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:00,432
♫ Let's do it. ♫

314
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,480
What you reading?

315
00:22:11,818 --> 00:22:14,150
“The Psychosis of Murder.“

316
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:17,954
So, I guess you're really
into this stuff.

317
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:21,791
You know, I never met anyone
that wanted to be a serial killer.

318
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:24,888
- It's pretty cool.
- Thanks.

319
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:28,264
If you're serious about this stuff,
you're gonna need some help.

320
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:33,063
- Help?
- Yeah, look at all these books.

321
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,836
It's gonna take you weeks
to get through all this information.

322
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:40,570
Unless you had someone
who can do the research with you.

323
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:44,214
- Like who?
- Who do you think?

324
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:48,312
Then what's in it for you?

325
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:53,258
Hmm... let's just say I share
a personal interest in this topic.

326
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:58,293
I help you become a serial killer
and you let me be your first victim.

327
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:00,799
- What?
-Yeah, you heard me.

328
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:04,235
-You wanna die?
- It's not a question of dying.

329
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:06,262
It's a matter of fame.

330
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,274
“Sasha Fitzgerald,

331
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:12,472
the first victim
of serial killer Casey Noland.“

332
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,411
Yeah, it does have
a nice ring to it.

333
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:18,178
Yeah, I wanna be
the Sharon Tate of the '90s.

334
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,686
So, do we have a deal?

335
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:31,493
- ( knock on door)
- What?

336
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:35,932
What did you do now? You and I have
a little meeting tomorrow after school,

337
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:38,267
- with your guidance counselor?
- That guy is a jerk-off.

338
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:41,297
I didn't take his stupid
aptitude test seriously.

339
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:43,901
He said something
about killing people.

340
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:47,471
I told him that I wanted to be
a serial killer when I grow up.

341
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:51,507
Very funny, Casey. Come on, you can't
kid around like that in school.

342
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,648
Come downstairs.
I got “Taco Hell“ for dinner.

343
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:06,827
- Mrs. Noland.
- Mr. Korn.

344
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:09,767
Thank you for coming by.
Casey, come on in. Have a seat.

345
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:19,478
Okay.

346
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:21,946
Well, let's get down
to the business at hand.

347
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:26,812
- Has Casey shown you this paper?
- Ah... no.

348
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:32,150
Well, evidently,
your son finds it humorous

349
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:34,251
to joke about death
and murder.

350
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:38,890
Mr. Korn, Caseyjust has
this really odd sense of humor.

351
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't find
mutilation and dismemberment

352
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:45,671
to be an appropriate topic
for a paper.

353
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:48,265
I'm gonna fail him
if he doesn't change the subject.

354
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:50,276
All right. Well, I promise

355
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,676
I will help Casey pick a new topic.

356
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,612
in addition,

357
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,480
I gave Casey
a career profile survey,

358
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:01,317
which incidentally
I had to mark by hand.

359
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:03,049
(sighs)

360
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:05,421
He is qualified to be either...

361
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:08,950
a parking meter maid,
a night security guard,

362
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:11,429
or a toll booth operator.

363
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:14,626
Not very ambitious
careers, are they?

364
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,431
Mr. Korn,
Casey's a bright kid.

365
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,802
He just hasn't
found his niche.

366
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,740
Well, Casey,
give me “the McCoy.“

367
00:25:22,776 --> 00:25:25,336
When you graduate
at the end of this year,

368
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:28,279
- what do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

369
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,110
- Toll booth operator sounds good.
- Mrs. Noland: Casey!

370
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:38,019
Casey, you're not dissing me.
You're dissing yourself.

371
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:40,856
Because in six months you will have
graduated from this high school,

372
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:43,385
and you have no plans
for your future.

373
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,660
Listen, i know
it must be very tough

374
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:49,293
for a young man to start
his senior year at a new school,

375
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:52,702
but this behavior...
is abnormal.

376
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:56,241
Incidentally, I took this from Casey.

377
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:58,744
It's a band called
Marilyn Manson

378
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:01,747
and I don't know whether or not
you are familiar with their lyrics.

379
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:05,678
No. It's not exactly
my kind of music.

380
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:12,223
Well, in this song, they are
talking about eating cake

381
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:15,819
and sodomizing
each other and...

382
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:18,387
that date rape
is a kind thing to do.

383
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:22,026
They are clearly
glorifying Satan.

384
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:27,267
They are proclaiming
themselves to be the gods of--

385
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:29,832
- the gods--
- Fuck. Gods of fuck.

386
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,901
Casey, stop it!

387
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:34,311
This is what I'm talking about,
Mrs. Noland.

388
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:37,839
Ah, Ms. Lindon. Very nice to see you.
Thank you for coming by.

389
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:42,253
Mrs. Noland, Casey, this is Ms. Sally
Lindon, the school psychologist.

390
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,383
It's nice to meet you.
Sorry I'm late.

391
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:49,794
Ms. Lindon and I have talked it over.
We feel it would be extremely helpful

392
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,195
if Casey would start
counseling twice a week.

393
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:55,224
- What?
- Excuse me.

394
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:57,395
No offense, but...

395
00:26:57,437 --> 00:26:59,302
I don't know
if I'm exactly thrilled

396
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,467
- about my son seeing a shrink.
-Yeah, me neither.

397
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:05,876
Of course Casey doesn't have to go
to counseling with Ms. Lindon,

398
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:08,244
but if he doesn't,
I'm gonna fail him on his paper.

399
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,875
- ( sighs )
- Ms. Lindon: it won't be that bad.

400
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:14,080
Instead of going to the gym,
you come spend that period with me.

401
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,418
Cool.

402
00:27:19,025 --> 00:27:23,155
Mrs. Noland, Casey shows many
of the troubling signs we associate

403
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:25,426
with... mentally disturbed adults,

404
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:27,558
but if we can nip it in the bud,

405
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,932
we can help Casey become
a respectable, responsible,

406
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,699
- contributing member of society.
- ( sighs )

407
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,934
His father passed away
a year ago and...

408
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:36,805
We're aware of that, Mrs. Noland.

409
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:39,141
But it's time for Casey
to start moving past his grief.

410
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,678
- Ray, there's been another--
- ( flatulence)

411
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:47,413
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Mexican again?!

412
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:50,320
- Another what?
- Another murder down at the park.

413
00:27:52,692 --> 00:27:55,354
You'd better hurry up.
The press is already down there.

414
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:57,386
Press? Press.

415
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:02,726
You have no idea what you're
gonna do with the rest of your life.

416
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:07,035
Well, have a look at this paper.
Look at this survey.

417
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,541
You know, quite frankly...

418
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:16,208
I think the only thing you're qualified
to be is... a serial killer.

419
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:21,478
You know what?

420
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:24,388
You're absolutely right.

421
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:35,967
This is not psychologically
normal, Casey.

422
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:42,367
Casey, will you stop
killing your teachers?

423
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,467
Honey, you are never
gonna graduate!

424
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,978
That was stupid fresh, Casey.

425
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:49,743
Maybe this is
the right career for you.

426
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:52,216
( barking )

427
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:57,212
( dog barking )

428
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,830
Casey:
Mr. Grimaldi?

429
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,525
Why aren't you dressed
for gymnasium class?

430
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:11,036
I have to meet
with the school psychiatrist.

431
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:16,606
Ms. Lindon?
What in the hell for?

432
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:19,874
Well, they say is that I don't have
enough direction in my life.

433
00:29:19,912 --> 00:29:21,903
Casey...

434
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,146
what you need in your life
is more discipline.

435
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:28,153
I think you know that.

436
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:31,020
The kind of discipline
that it can only be found

437
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:32,922
here in gymnasium class.

438
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:37,089
Casey, if you allow this class
to be something in your life,

439
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,293
it can be a warm, nurturing,

440
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,301
embracing nest.

441
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:45,361
Like chickens have
in a hen house.

442
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:48,169
You know what I mean?

443
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:52,075
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna be
late for... Ms. Lindon.

444
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:54,136
Another thing...

445
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,115
if I find out it was you who put
those bumper stickers on my van,

446
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,449
I'm gonna squash
your nuts into oblivion.

447
00:30:00,486 --> 00:30:03,819
And tell those boys from home economics
to stop calling my house.

448
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:11,122
- How about this one?
- The blob.

449
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:15,360
- What does this look like to you?
- The sequel.

450
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:18,461
- And this one?
- A vagina?

451
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:27,704
- Casey, do you remember your dreams?
- Sometimes.

452
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:31,012
- Tell me about them.
- Well, last night, I had a dream

453
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,883
that I took I really big knife
and Iopped off Mr. Korn's head

454
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,411
and then I threw
the knife in your skull.

455
00:30:36,456 --> 00:30:40,449
Then Mr. Korn's decapitated head
told me I'd be a good serial killer.

456
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:47,899
You know, Casey,
this would be

457
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:50,664
an excellent
extracurricular activity for you.

458
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:54,400
it would give you an opportunity
to be of help in the community

459
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,170
and to socialize
with kids your own age.

460
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,178
“Adopt a grandparent?“

461
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:01,203
You've seen the signs
in the school, haven't you?

462
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:03,408
Yeah, but old people?

463
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:05,974
They're so... old.

464
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:09,010
I think you'll find spending time
with the elderly

465
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:11,023
to be very rewarding.

466
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:16,820
Listen to this: “Everything serial
offenders do and think about is directed

467
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:20,822
towards assisting and fulfilling
their otherwise inadequate lives.

468
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:24,735
This book says
that the most crucial single factor

469
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:28,400
in the development of a serial killer
is the role of fantasy.

470
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:31,808
Edmund Kemper's fantasy involves
sex and death.

471
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:34,142
He had to completely
possess his partner,

472
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,274
this meant possessing her life.

473
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,841
So, what's your fantasy?

474
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:45,818
I guess I don't have one.

475
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:49,316
Well, it also says
that Kemper was like this

476
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:53,059
because he was trying to rid himself of
his domineering and abusive mother.

477
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:55,067
So, what's your mom like?
Is she cool?

478
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:57,831
Yeah. Yeah,
my mom is great.

479
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,169
Things have been kind of tough
on her since my dad died, though.

480
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:04,142
- Sorry.
- Yeah. He was a cop.

481
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:07,203
Some scumbag shot him.
We moved out here to start over.

482
00:32:07,246 --> 00:32:11,478
Your dad was a cop.
Why be a serial killer?

483
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:17,488
Sally, I wanted to talk to you
about Casey Noland.

484
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:19,218
Sorry, I meant
to send you a note.

485
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:21,226
He's gonna be
meeting with me twice a week.

486
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,093
Oh, really? Missing
more gymnasium class, will he?

487
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,155
You know,
he's failing as it is.

488
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:28,326
Casey has a number of problems
to work through.

489
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:31,996
- Oh, yeah. Like what?
- That's too complicated to get into.

490
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:35,166
Sally, I'm concerned about

491
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,904
Casey Noland's welfare
just like you are.

492
00:32:40,146 --> 00:32:42,137
Casey wants
to become a serial killer.

493
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:44,172
(laughing)

494
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:50,016
- Really?
- It's really not funny, Vince.

495
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:53,150
It's a little funny.
Listen...

496
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:56,457
I know you've got your psycho
mumbo-jumbo business going on,

497
00:32:56,496 --> 00:33:00,489
but that's not gonna give him
the proper discipline that Casey needs.

498
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:04,526
That discipline can only be found
in gymnasium class.

499
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,870
The only thing he finds
in gymnasium class are more problems.

500
00:33:10,576 --> 00:33:13,067
Serial killer, huh?

501
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:16,675
Shut up, Frank.

502
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:24,088
- How are your grades?
- Why?

503
00:33:24,123 --> 00:33:26,785
It looks like a lot of these guys
are really smart.

504
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:29,795
Like Edmund Kemper,
he had an IQ of 146.

505
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:32,229
So, how did you do
on your last English exam?

506
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:35,029
- I didn't study for it at all.
- What was your grade?

507
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,331
A D+.

508
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,395
Look, if you wanna be
like these guys,

509
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:42,202
you're really gonna have
to start doing better in school.

510
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:44,675
You're also are gonna have
to start dressing better.

511
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,235
What's wrong
with the way I dress?

512
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,579
I mean, I like it.
It's cool, but...

513
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:52,174
it's not the way
these guys dress.

514
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,709
You gotta be more conservative.
Look at this.

515
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:57,587
Ted Bundy--
he was a young Republican.

516
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:03,053
And when they catch these guys,
the neighbors always say, like,

517
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:05,222
“Oh, he was
such a nice man.

518
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:08,461
We had no idea.
He was such a quiet man.“

519
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,469
You know,
you have to blend in.

520
00:34:10,503 --> 00:34:13,028
- Blend in?
- Yeah.

521
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:15,597
- I don't even know where to start.
- I do.

522
00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:20,203
- So, what do you think?
- Very nice.

523
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:22,009
You look like J. Crew's evil twin.

524
00:34:22,048 --> 00:34:24,676
- lf anybody's got any information...
- Hey, check it out.

525
00:34:24,717 --> 00:34:28,483
...about the murder of Michael Berman
or Tara Bolasky, who is still missing,

526
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:31,285
notify your police department.

527
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:35,192
Tragic.
Here's Chuck with the weather.

528
00:34:35,227 --> 00:34:37,092
Tragic?
I'll tell you what's tragic.

529
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:40,826
I just got my new car washed
and we're expecting rain, rain, rain.

530
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:42,094
Wow.

531
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:45,365
I bet with all the information we have,
we could probably catch this killer.

532
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:48,339
- Yeah, maybe.
- I wish I could talk to him.

533
00:34:48,374 --> 00:34:51,741
You know, see what it's like,
get some pointers from him.

534
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:53,972
I don't think he'd be
too interested in chatting.

535
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:57,244
Yeah, so what's in the book?
Anything interesting?

536
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:59,547
Yeah, it says you first need
to pick a type of a victim.

537
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:01,815
Like Ted Bundy liked
to kill teenage girls.

538
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:04,084
I don't think I could
kill teenage girls.

539
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:05,886
I like 'em too much.

540
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:11,488
How about ifl kill old people?

541
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,795
Put them out of their misery.
Maybe even terminally ill patients.

542
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,165
Yeah.

543
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:20,195
You could be Casey Noland,
the Dr. Kevorkian of serial killers.

544
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:22,773
I like that.

545
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:26,471
Okay, now you need a type
of a pattern, like the Zodiac Killer.

546
00:35:27,513 --> 00:35:30,277
How about I kill every time
one of those infomercials come on

547
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:34,184
- for the Psychic Pals Network?
- No, it's on too often.

548
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,484
How about a weapon
or a special way of killing?

549
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:39,013
Okay, but I wanna be original.

550
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,253
I wanna use something
no one's ever used before,

551
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:43,318
so it guarantees me
a place in history.

552
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:46,559
- How about a baseball bat?
- That's too athletic.

553
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,536
- A chainsaw?
- That's used in too many movies.

554
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,562
Jeffrey Dahmer once drilled a hole
in a victim's head

555
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,474
while the guy was still alive
and then he poured acid inside.

556
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,307
Mrs. Noland:
Dinner!

557
00:36:03,582 --> 00:36:05,777
- Mom...
- Mmm?

558
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:08,378
- ...this is Sasha.
- Mmm.

559
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:11,982
Excuse me.
Well, hello.

560
00:36:12,024 --> 00:36:14,151
Pleased to meet you.

561
00:36:14,193 --> 00:36:16,627
( laughs )
Casey, look at you.

562
00:36:16,662 --> 00:36:18,755
Mr. Clean Cut, huh?

563
00:36:18,798 --> 00:36:20,698
Looks like you're
a good influence on him.

564
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,564
Thanks.

565
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,865
So, anyway,
you wanna stay for dinner?

566
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:26,997
No, thanks. I don't eat meat.

567
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,803
I can whip you up
a salad or... cereal?

568
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:31,503
That's all right.
I gotta go.

569
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:33,068
Okay.

570
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:34,773
It was nice
to meet you, Mrs. Noland.

571
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:35,974
You too.

572
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,814
So, I got tickets
to that Marilyn Manson concert

573
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:44,880
on Thursday night,
if you wanna go.

574
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:46,858
That concert's sold out.

575
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:51,090
Well, I know, but my dad's company
was able to get tickets, so...

576
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,727
Yeah-- no,
I'd love to go.

577
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:59,704
Cool. Great.

578
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,440
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

579
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:05,467
- Bye, Case'.
- Bye.

580
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:10,406
Case'.

581
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:12,644
( laughs )
Don't even start with me, no.

582
00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:14,778
I'm not gonna say a word.

583
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:20,449
Well, she's-- she's cute.

584
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,923
Oh, man, look at it.
Junk mail and more bills.

585
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:43,481
- Man: Maylhelp you?
- Actually, I can have a little...

586
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:45,984
help.

587
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:53,119
- Oh, but these are nice over here.
- Oh, yeah-- yeah, I like these.

588
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,788
Yeah, they're 7 1/4-inch
"dinanite carbicle" T-saw blades.

589
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:59,423
Then you're gonna have to buy
one of these big babies here.

590
00:37:59,465 --> 00:38:01,956
- No, I'll just take the blades.
- Just want the blades?

591
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,992
All right, fine.
Movin' right along.

592
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:06,903
Oh, it's here-- you're gonna need
one of these for your tools.

593
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:09,373
You've got so much stuff,
a little tool belt for you.

594
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,104
Let's see. One of these,
one of these.

595
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:15,511
One of these,
one of those, and two of these.

596
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:17,846
Good. Turn.

597
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:21,785
- Is this a good grass blower?
- Ah, yeah, yeah. That-- it blows.

598
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:25,814
It blows well, actually. The problem is,
they're not very dangerous.

599
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:27,917
What if something sharp
got stuck in it?

600
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,895
Like those giant drill bits.
What if somebody took one of those

601
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,591
and shoved it in there
and started it?

602
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:34,895
Ahh, ooh--
yeah, that would hurt.

603
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:37,767
See you later.
Toodles.

604
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:42,400
Weird guy.

605
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:45,738
- Yeah.
- Hey, can I come in?

606
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:48,941
-Yeah, come in.
- Whoa, awesome tools.

607
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:51,006
- Yeah.
- How'd you pay for all those?

608
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,984
Dad's insurance.

609
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:56,112
I couldn't decide on just one weapon.
There's just too many of 'em.

610
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:59,352
That's okay, you can be the hardware
store murderer or something.

611
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:01,825
I brought some books--
they might help you out.

612
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,261
- Cool.
- What's this?

613
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:07,094
Oh, that's my dissection program
for biology class.

614
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:08,622
Oh, cool.

615
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,635
I got this great stuff
off the internet.

616
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:13,331
The psychological profile
of a serial killer.

617
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,533
Let me see.

618
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:17,838
Let's see.

619
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:21,472
“Body disposal:
Hide the body, dismember it,

620
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:25,779
display it, throw it away
or a combination of any of the above.“

621
00:39:25,818 --> 00:39:27,547
I don't think
I have space to display it

622
00:39:27,586 --> 00:39:30,316
and I don't think my mom's gonna be
very happy with dead bodies

623
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,586
hanging on all over,
so I need to throw 'em away.

624
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,219
It would be easier if you
dismembered it and then trashed it.

625
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:37,252
I guess, but I'm not
gonna be too comfortable

626
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:40,788
with chopping up dead bodies.
I can't even dissect a fetal pig.

627
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,858
Okay...

628
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:46,201
“Take a souvenir or trophy from
the victim, like a ring or a necklace.“

629
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:48,229
Yeah, it lets you relive the kill.

630
00:39:48,274 --> 00:39:51,175
These guys would give them
to their girlfriends or their wives--

631
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,373
it would reassert
their domination and control.

632
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:57,473
I guess I'm not gonna have anybody
to give a souvenir to.

633
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,445
“Postmortem sex.“

634
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:08,352
- Sex with an old dead lady?
-Yeah, a lot of the killers do it.

635
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:10,385
I think I'm gonna pass
on that one.

636
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:12,989
Okay, so you're not
into sexual experimentation.

637
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:19,664
Okay...

638
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:22,071
the killer is a male.
Check.

639
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:25,508
The victims' race will be the same
as the killer's. Check.

640
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:27,535
- Usually single?
- Check.

641
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:29,672
And middle class.
Check.

642
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:33,549
- Resides away from the crime scene.
-You know, that's not a problem.

643
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:35,883
There's an old age home
half an hour away from here.

644
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:39,322
- What kind of car does your mom drive?
- A Taurus. Why?

645
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:41,758
According to John Douglas,
the Volkswagen Beetle

646
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:43,887
was a serial murderers'
car of choice.

647
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:48,059
That's weird. You know who has a VW?
That crazy janitor at school.

648
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,729
- Maybe he's a serial killer.
- That guy is a freak.

649
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,635
I mean, he walks around
all day at school,

650
00:40:53,672 --> 00:40:55,537
mumbling to himself,
mopping the floors.

651
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:58,805
I heard they hired him off some mental
institution program or something.

652
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,607
( barking )

653
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:03,376
That fucking dog
keeps me up all night long.

654
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:09,010
You know, Edmund Kemper once said
that the true measure of a psychopath

655
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:12,683
lies in the quality
of his animal torture.

656
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,989
Ithink you should
kill the dog.

657
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:18,190
I was thinking about that, but I thought
I'd be better off killing people.

658
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,722
You should take this one step at a time.
You don't wanna rush into anything.

659
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:24,463
I think you need to start small.

660
00:41:24,503 --> 00:41:26,630
- Kill it.
- Fine.

661
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:28,469
I'll kill a fucking dog.

662
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,702
You know what?
You should do it after the show.

663
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:32,836
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

664
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:35,506
( crowd screaming )

665
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:47,489
What's this about women in the army?
What kind of a military is that, huh?

666
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:50,393
I'll tell you what, I think
those guys are all a bunch of fags

667
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,329
and they like to put on
their little green uniforms

668
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,924
and parade around,
am I right? Ha!

669
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:57,026
You are such a dickhead.

670
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:59,799
Pull up your pants.
You're talking out your ass.

671
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:01,931
I was in the military.

672
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:05,171
And I worked with a lot of women.
And not one of them was a fag.

673
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,611
- Jesus, Vince, man--
- Hey! Can it, boy!

674
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:10,547
I didn't know
you were in the military.

675
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:13,142
Military was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

676
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:17,315
You know, I was raised up in Alabama
by a one-titted whore.

677
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:21,122
Whoring for a living,
what my momma was doing.

678
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,153
Whenever she played out on me,
my grandma and my grandpa raised me.

679
00:42:25,197 --> 00:42:28,496
They died when I was 16
and then I went to the army.

680
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:31,264
- I didn't know, I--
- Well, now you know.

681
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:35,672
- I'm sorry.
- Fighting in Granada for the US of A,

682
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:37,607
storming the medical campus,

683
00:42:37,643 --> 00:42:41,739
hand-to-hand combat
with Mexican medical students.

684
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,372
That's so shitty.

685
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,782
It's a good thing,
that army training.

686
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:50,311
I pass that on to my gymnasium
class students, too.

687
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:54,888
- I'm sorry, Vince.
- Oh, shut up.

688
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:58,920
You're not a man. You're a prancing,
little ball, a sissy thing.

689
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:01,091
Look, Vince,
I didn't know you were--

690
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:03,966
Oh, I'm just funnin' you.
I'm just funnin' you.

691
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:05,594
Casey: Oh, wow.

692
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:08,663
- Great Marilyn Manson concert.
- Casey: Yeah.

693
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:22,149
- You left your keys in the car.
- Oh, shit.

694
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:24,815
Do you have anything
we can break in with?

695
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,290
No.

696
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:30,591
We gotta call a locksmith.

697
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,895
- How are you doing, Vince?
- Hey, Ray, how are you doing?

698
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:38,926
- Good, good, good. How's work?
-You know how it is.

699
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:42,168
Little bastards don't appreciate
nothing that you do for 'em.

700
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,233
Wipin' their asses one day
and their noses the next.

701
00:43:45,277 --> 00:43:47,245
How is it going
with that serial killer?

702
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:49,213
Between you and me,

703
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:51,876
we got a few suspects.

704
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,942
We 're looking
for a younger man.

705
00:43:53,986 --> 00:43:57,581
Because lots of these psychos,
they look for victims their own age.

706
00:43:57,623 --> 00:44:00,251
Uh-huh. Well, if you're
looking for a young guy

707
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:03,921
that has the wants and desires
of a woman trapped inside a man's body,

708
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:06,192
you oughta talk
to Pessin over here.

709
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:08,859
- Jesus, I said I was sorry.
- Yeah.

710
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:12,428
You know, speaking of...
that serial killin' business,

711
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:14,962
I got this kid
in my gymnasium class

712
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:18,067
who says he wants to grow up
and be a serial killer.

713
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:22,305
-You are kidding me.
- I'm not kidding.

714
00:44:22,347 --> 00:44:24,042
He's in therapy for it.

715
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:26,346
I mean, you ask me,
he couldn't kill a housefly

716
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:28,376
if his head was shaped
like a swatter.

717
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,912
But somebody believes him.
They got him in that counseling.

718
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:33,652
All right.

719
00:44:33,692 --> 00:44:36,752
- What's this kid's name?
- Noland.

720
00:44:36,795 --> 00:44:39,855
- Casey Noland.
- All right.

721
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:42,731
- I'm on it.
- Good.

722
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:46,329
- ( pager beeps )
- Goddamn it.

723
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:49,499
All right.
I'm out of here.

724
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:54,007
Get everybody a drink on me,
except for Pessin.

725
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,114
Casey Noland.

726
00:45:00,452 --> 00:45:03,421
- Thanks for the ticket.
- No problem.

727
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:06,616
Who else was I gonna ask--
it wasn't a date.

728
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:11,586
You know what, Sasha,
I'm kind of embarrassed about this,

729
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,498
but... I really like you.

730
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:18,903
( car door shuts )

731
00:45:18,937 --> 00:45:20,928
Grimaldi:
You called for a locksmith?

732
00:45:20,973 --> 00:45:22,634
Mr. Grimaldi?

733
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:25,666
Well, corn hole me
at the Saturday dance,

734
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:29,112
Casey Noland, my favorite
gymnasium class student.

735
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:31,911
- You're a locksmith?
- I am a locksmith, Casey,

736
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,510
on weeknights and weekends.

737
00:45:34,553 --> 00:45:36,748
Gotta work a second job,
you know?

738
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:39,723
Well, with the economy
being what it is...

739
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:44,218
quite frankly, the working man's place
in the work force is always at risk,

740
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,788
being usurped
by foreign influences.

741
00:45:46,832 --> 00:45:50,268
But I don't have to tell you that.
You probably know what I mean.

742
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:58,399
Maybe not.
What do we got going on here?

743
00:45:58,443 --> 00:46:01,901
I-- I locked
my keys in the car.

744
00:46:01,947 --> 00:46:05,212
All righty, then.
I'll justjump right in,

745
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,243
have this worked out
in two shakes of a Iamb's tail,

746
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:12,519
have you and your little
pretty friend out of here, double time!

747
00:46:12,557 --> 00:46:14,991
Thanks, Mr. Grimaldi.

748
00:46:15,027 --> 00:46:16,995
Your name's... Sasha, isn't it?

749
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:19,395
Yeah, I had you
sophomore year.

750
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:21,831
( laughs )
You sure did.

751
00:46:24,403 --> 00:46:26,371
There you go, Case'.

752
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:30,341
Thanks, Mr. Grimaldi.

753
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,240
How much-- how much
do I owe you?

754
00:46:32,277 --> 00:46:34,609
You can give me Sasha
and we'll call it even.

755
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:36,341
Ha! Just funnin' ya.

756
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:39,942
No charge tonight.
You two kids run along.

757
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:43,682
- Thanks. That's really nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

758
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:45,587
Now, don't tell anybody
at high school.

759
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:48,457
I wouldn't wanna ruin
my reputation as a hard ass.

760
00:46:48,493 --> 00:46:50,859
Sure.

761
00:46:50,896 --> 00:46:52,864
Drive carefully!

762
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:00,605
Good night.

763
00:47:01,606 --> 00:47:03,665
Sleep tight.

764
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:12,475
Ah, enough of this shit.

765
00:47:14,186 --> 00:47:16,347
I'm gonna go see the real thing.

766
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:19,050
I still can't believe that dick
had to be the one to help us.

767
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:20,718
i don't know why
you hate him so much.

768
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:22,693
He seems like a really nice guy.

769
00:47:27,065 --> 00:47:29,693
- I had a good time tonight.
- Yeah, me too.

770
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:31,930
Thanks for going
with me.

771
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:36,500
Good night.

772
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,270
Good night.

773
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:44,282
I-- I'll call you tomorrow.

774
00:48:09,508 --> 00:48:11,476
( muffled screams )

775
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:15,313
- ( squeaks )
. He-.

776
00:48:15,347 --> 00:48:17,372
(grunts)

777
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:29,859
(toy laughing)

778
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:51,205
Let's get messier.

779
00:48:52,217 --> 00:48:54,208
( laughs )

780
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,221
How groovy!

781
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:59,246
No, that's too “Evil Dead.“

782
00:49:02,627 --> 00:49:04,595
Time to carve some puppy?

783
00:49:06,364 --> 00:49:08,992
Fuck it!
Let's get over with it.

784
00:49:31,556 --> 00:49:33,490
( squeals )

785
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:35,618
(engine sputters)

786
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,185
- ( engine humming)
- ( shot fires)

787
00:49:45,337 --> 00:49:47,737
(yelps)

788
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:49,763
( squeals )

789
00:49:53,712 --> 00:49:57,705
Hygiene isn't just about
“Hey, get the germs off me, man.“

790
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:00,240
But it's also very important
on a job interview...

791
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:03,482
- Did you do it?
- No, I couldn't do it.

792
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:07,754
- He was too cute.
-You couldn't even kill a dog.

793
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,692
I just--

794
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:17,030
Now, it's also very important, when
you're going on thatjob interview...

795
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:19,298
Did you hear what happened
with Marni Greenstein?

796
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:24,404
- No, what happened?
- She disappeared last night.

797
00:50:24,442 --> 00:50:27,502
There were cops swarming
around her house all morning.

798
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:32,176
- Are you through?
- Yes.

799
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:35,015
Are you sure there's nothing you'd like
to share with the class?

800
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:37,851
- No.
- Okay.

801
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:41,290
Now, teeth-- brush 'em.

802
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:44,955
You don't wanna go to that interview
with your breath smelling like “booty."

803
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:47,794
Today we're gonna play
a little word association.

804
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:50,858
I say a word and you tell me the first
word or two that comes to mind.

805
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:51,994
Gotcha.

806
00:50:52,037 --> 00:50:53,470
- Red.
- Blood.

807
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,508
- Boy.
- George.

808
00:50:57,542 --> 00:50:58,907
- Girl.
- Boy George.

809
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:00,468
- Casey!
- Me?

810
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:02,104
- ( sighs )
- What?

811
00:51:02,147 --> 00:51:05,514
You know, you've really been
improving this past week.

812
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,745
You cleaned yourself up.
You're dressing better.

813
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:10,482
Your grades are improving.
I'm really proud of you.

814
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:13,491
- But why can't you ever be serious?
- ( knocking on door)

815
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,720
Come in.

816
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,957
- Ahh, Ms. Sally Lindon?
- Yes?

817
00:51:18,997 --> 00:51:22,865
I'm Detective
Raymond Berro. I...

818
00:51:22,901 --> 00:51:26,029
I'm looking for one of your students.
Casey Noland?

819
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:28,164
- Is there a problem?
- No, ma'am.

820
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:29,969
There's no problem.
Nothing's wrong.

821
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:32,272
But I would like
to talk to him alone.

822
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:36,474
- Well, I'll be right outside.
- Fine, thank you.

823
00:51:46,424 --> 00:51:49,518
So, hot shot,

824
00:51:49,561 --> 00:51:51,791
I hear you wanna be
a serial killer.

825
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,526
Yeah, so?

826
00:51:54,566 --> 00:51:58,002
So, I have
a missing girl here

827
00:51:58,036 --> 00:52:00,869
with your name
written all over it.

828
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:02,770
You know this girl?

829
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:06,368
Yeah, it's Marni Greenstein.
She's in one of my classes.

830
00:52:06,411 --> 00:52:08,345
I understand
you don't get along very well.

831
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,610
Yeah, she was
a stuck-up bitch.

832
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:13,140
- Where were you last night?
- I went to a concert.

833
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:16,381
- Yeah, what did you do after that?
- I went home and I went to bed.

834
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:20,050
- Yeah, what did you do after that?
- Well, I--

835
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:22,685
- What did you do?
- Okay, I admit it. Ijerked off.

836
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:24,058
Hey!
( loud whistle)

837
00:52:24,095 --> 00:52:25,824
Don't become
a smart ass with me.

838
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:28,260
- Ray.
- Yeah.

839
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:31,097
Excuse me, but there's--
there's something you should see.

840
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:36,234
You don't go anywhere.

841
00:52:40,445 --> 00:52:43,005
We interviewed
a teacher named Korn.

842
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:45,312
He claims he sent the girl
to the lost and found.

843
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,318
So, we go
to the lost and found...

844
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:49,343
it's in the boiler room.

845
00:52:51,589 --> 00:52:53,181
So, we searched
the place, right?

846
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:57,388
And we find this,
Marni Greenstein's notebook.

847
00:52:57,429 --> 00:52:59,226
- Who's this guy?
- He's the janitor.

848
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:02,392
Custodian.
Head custodian.

849
00:53:02,434 --> 00:53:03,799
Custodian. Excuse me.

850
00:53:03,835 --> 00:53:06,998
Not only that, he's got a very keen
interest in young girls.

851
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,468
I think this is our guy.
I say we take him down to the station

852
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,977
and see if we get him to talk.

853
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:17,004
All right.
But in the meantime...

854
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,841
I wanna keep my eye
on this kid.

855
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,546
Brad, bring him in.

856
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,115
Wait a minute.

857
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:29,990
This thing is way
too damn loud.

858
00:53:31,096 --> 00:53:33,428
I'm surprised
you didn't get caught last night.

859
00:53:33,465 --> 00:53:36,457
You know, Frank, the janitor?
He was arrested.

860
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:39,993
Yeah, I know.
They got the wrong guy.

861
00:53:40,038 --> 00:53:42,165
He even doesn't
fit the profile.

862
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:44,107
They must know something
we don't.

863
00:53:44,142 --> 00:53:46,235
They don't know anything.
They're stupid cops.

864
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:50,043
No, they questioned you.
We gotta be careful now.

865
00:53:50,081 --> 00:53:52,948
What does it matter?
I couldn't even kill a damn dog.

866
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:55,043
- I am a failure.
- Relax.

867
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:57,350
You just need
to kill a real person.

868
00:53:57,388 --> 00:53:59,822
After your first,
it's not supposed to be that tough.

869
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:02,850
I think I'm gonna go and kill
one of those old people first.

870
00:54:02,894 --> 00:54:04,293
Just to practice.

871
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:08,231
I promise, ifl ever get caught, I'll
tell everyone you were my first kill.

872
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,858
I hope I am your first.

873
00:54:14,072 --> 00:54:17,439
We should scope out
the old age home tomorrow.

874
00:54:17,475 --> 00:54:20,638
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, sure.

875
00:54:20,678 --> 00:54:24,671
♫ in a peril-act world... ♫

876
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:28,117
- Casey, what are we looking for?
- Someone who looks senile.

877
00:54:31,723 --> 00:54:34,317
- How about that one?
- Let me see.

878
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:41,427
- Casey: oh-ho, per'lbct.
- So, what are you gonna do?

879
00:54:41,466 --> 00:54:43,263
I figure I'll find a good time
to go up there

880
00:54:43,301 --> 00:54:45,667
and grab one of these old farts
and carry 'em away.

881
00:54:45,703 --> 00:54:47,261
Do you think
that's gonna work?

882
00:54:47,305 --> 00:54:49,603
They're so dazed,
they don't know what's going on.

883
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:52,371
I'll drive her
to some secluded spot and kill her.

884
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,139
Unbelievable! That old bag's been
walking in circles for hours.

885
00:54:59,184 --> 00:55:02,813
I never wanna get old.
They look so bored and hopeless.

886
00:55:02,854 --> 00:55:04,754
Yeah, God,
I hate retirement homes.

887
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:07,656
it's like you can smell
the death inside.

888
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:09,284
Hey, wait, listen to this.

889
00:55:09,327 --> 00:55:11,261
There's more
Volkswagen stuff in this book.

890
00:55:11,296 --> 00:55:14,857
It says that a lot of the serial killers
own VW Beetles,

891
00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:18,198
but then they switch to a van.
“Because unlike a car,

892
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:21,603
in the back of the van you can do
whatever you want and not be seen.

893
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:24,073
You have in effect
a mobile murder site.“

894
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:26,702
- You know who drives one of those?
- I almost forgot...

895
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:30,236
they let Frank, the janitor, go
last night. They said he had an alibi.

896
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:34,012
And that the police think that the
killer had some kind of special tools,

897
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:37,488
so that he could sneak into these homes
so easily. They're calling him--

898
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:40,548
The locksmith killer.
Sasha, it's Grimaldi!

899
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:44,153
Oh, come on.
I agree there are a lot of similarities,

900
00:55:44,195 --> 00:55:48,427
but I refuse to believe that a high
school gym teacher is a serial killer.

901
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:51,993
He is a war vet. He's probably killed
many people. Plus, he drives a VW van.

902
00:55:52,036 --> 00:55:55,597
You're insane. Just because you don't
like the guy, it doesn't mean--

903
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,541
Look, all these victims are
young girls, high school girls.

904
00:55:58,576 --> 00:56:02,068
Have you seen “Silence of the Lambs“?
We covet what we see every day.

905
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:04,445
This guy is surrounded
by hot chicks in short shorts.

906
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:06,712
Casey, that's a movie.
It's not real.

907
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:09,481
Grimaldi is the killer.
I'm gonna prove it.

908
00:56:11,956 --> 00:56:14,254
- Hit any?
- Three for three.

909
00:56:14,292 --> 00:56:16,988
Cool.
I need a favor.

910
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:22,029
-You need some C-4?
- No, no C-4.

911
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:25,297
I need some information. Can you go
to the police station with your dad?

912
00:56:25,336 --> 00:56:27,634
Yes, I could go there.
He's going there tonight.

913
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:29,663
Can you see what you can dig up
on Mr. Grimaldi?

914
00:56:29,707 --> 00:56:32,699
Yes, I will bring a shovel.
What do you need it for?

915
00:56:32,744 --> 00:56:34,439
Ijust have a hunch.

916
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:54,354
Good to go.

917
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:00,137
Time to kill.

918
00:57:24,662 --> 00:57:27,324
- Come on, it's time to go to bed.
- Charles, is that you?

919
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:31,199
- No, my name isn't Charles. Come on.
- I know that's you, Charles.

920
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:35,228
Oprah, come meet my grandson Charles.
He just stopped by for a visit.

921
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:38,401
What a lovely surprise!
So nice to meet you...

922
00:57:38,443 --> 00:57:40,934
Charlie.
Come on, it's time to go in!

923
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:43,709
- Time to go in. Good girl.
-You know, I think-- I think...

924
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:46,148
- Charlie is gonna come with us.
- Oh, shit.

925
00:57:46,184 --> 00:57:47,947
- Aren't you, Charles?
- Yeah.

926
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:55,384
What are you doing, Amil? You're not
messing up my computers again, are you?

927
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:59,055
- No, I'm just playing some games.
- Where's your dad?

928
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:01,930
He is in the dark room.

929
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,395
Losen

930
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:10,498
Hey, everyone.
This is my grandson, Charlie.

931
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:13,374
Nice to meet you, son.

932
00:58:13,411 --> 00:58:16,141
We've heard so much about you.

933
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:19,981
Look at those dimples.
He's adorable.

934
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:23,010
- Now, what's with all those tools?
- He's a big-time carpenter.

935
00:58:23,054 --> 00:58:27,491
Just look at that punum!
He's got your looks.

936
00:58:27,525 --> 00:58:31,484
So, where's the girlfriend?
You're not one of them faggots, are you?

937
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:39,832
Holly shite!
Whoo-oo!

938
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:53,314
- Have you constructed big sky rises?
- Do you build mansions?

939
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:55,911
Now, with all those tools,

940
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:58,421
you must be a busy boy.

941
00:58:58,456 --> 00:59:01,823
Jesus Christ!
I'm not a carpenter!

942
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:09,796
I'm an undercover detective.

943
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:14,861
Yeah, I'm currently tracking a serial
killer who goes after young girls.

944
00:59:14,906 --> 00:59:17,966
Wow, how do you do that?

945
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:23,278
First, I draw a psychological
profile of the murderer.

946
00:59:23,314 --> 00:59:27,978
I figure out his motive, his weapons,
any pattern that he may be killing.

947
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:29,953
How do you know?

948
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:33,423
Many serial killers,
they fit a particular lifestyle.

949
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:36,723
They're very charismatic,
although they lack soul.

950
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:38,695
Thank you for coming
to see me, Charlie.

951
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:41,664
You know I don't
have much time.

952
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:44,600
I've been telling my friends
about you for years.

953
00:59:44,635 --> 00:59:48,901
They started to think you don't exist.
I'm so proud of you.

954
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:52,740
When you were younger,
you were such a loose cannon,

955
00:59:52,777 --> 00:59:55,905
but you've become
such a respectable young man.

956
00:59:55,947 --> 00:59:58,939
I love you, Charlie.

957
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:02,319
I love you too, Gram.

958
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:25,305
Mr. Pekla, what job experiences
do you have?

959
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:29,803
- I worked in a fast food restaurant.
- Mm-hmm.

960
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:32,748
They fired me.
I pissed in their shake machine.

961
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:42,520
Dude, please.
Try to take this seriously.

962
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,460
( bell ringing )

963
01:00:51,702 --> 01:00:53,499
What's wrong?

964
01:00:53,538 --> 01:00:56,769
I had another bad fight
with my parents last night.

965
01:00:58,776 --> 01:01:01,040
- And how'd you do?
- I bonged.

966
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,171
That old lady thought
I was her grandson.

967
01:01:03,214 --> 01:01:05,876
I'm gonna give up.
This is getting really ridiculous.

968
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:08,317
You're not giving up.

969
01:01:10,288 --> 01:01:13,416
Tonight.
You and me at the park.

970
01:01:13,457 --> 01:01:15,652
You want me
to kill you tonight?

971
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:18,253
Yes, I still wanna be
your first victim.

972
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:21,891
- Are you sure you wanna die?
- Yeah.

973
01:01:24,535 --> 01:01:26,867
Yeah, definitely.

974
01:01:26,904 --> 01:01:28,895
Tonight...
at the park.

975
01:01:36,614 --> 01:01:38,605
Yes, ma'am.
Uh-huh.

976
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:41,949
The kid was by the Palms
nursing home last night.

977
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:44,352
I want you to stop by later
and see what he was up to.

978
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:47,323
Hold on, please.
Ray, I'm following three other leads--

979
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:49,292
Do it.

980
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:53,290
Go ahead, please.

981
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:56,323
Were your parents related
before they were married?

982
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:58,164
Get your ass up that rope.

983
01:01:58,202 --> 01:02:01,262
Mr. Grimaldi,

984
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,500
I have a meeting
with Ms. Lindon today.

985
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:08,574
Another one
of those stupid meetings.

986
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:11,343
Casey, when are you
gonna learn?

987
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:13,373
The discipline
that you need,

988
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:16,045
the help that you need,
is right here in gymnasium class.

989
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:19,056
You're right.
If I could just climb that rope,

990
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,581
- my life would be wonderful.
- Listen to me,

991
01:02:21,626 --> 01:02:23,594
you pole-smoking
“Playgirl" subscriber.

992
01:02:23,628 --> 01:02:25,687
You will treat me
with respect in my class.

993
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,721
Do you understand me?
Repeat that!

994
01:02:27,765 --> 01:02:30,325
I will treat you
with respect in your class.

995
01:02:30,368 --> 01:02:32,598
Get the hell out of here!

996
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:35,230
Tell me about your childhood.

997
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,468
Well, Ms. Lindon,
it was kind of tough.

998
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:39,669
I was a bastard child.

999
01:02:40,978 --> 01:02:44,209
And my mother told me my father
was probably a sailor she met one night.

1000
01:02:44,248 --> 01:02:48,241
Then, when I was seven,
she remarried a man named Mike...

1001
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:50,846
Mike “Cock-In-You.“

1002
01:02:50,888 --> 01:02:54,051
And he used to tease me.
He used to send me to school in dresses.

1003
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:56,525
He said I wasn't manly enough.
If that wasn't bad enough,

1004
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,755
he left my mother when I was 14
and by that time,

1005
01:02:58,796 --> 01:03:00,457
I had a nine-year-old half sister.

1006
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:03,331
And my mother was afraid that I'd
rape her. So, every night, before bed,

1007
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:06,029
she'd lock me up
in the basement and I spent...

1008
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,437
many nights planning
my revenge on that bitch!

1009
01:03:09,473 --> 01:03:11,737
- Are you finished?
- No, wait.

1010
01:03:11,776 --> 01:03:14,711
I didn't tell you
about my uncle Bob, Bob Booey.

1011
01:03:14,745 --> 01:03:17,543
When are you gonna grow up
and start acting like an adult?

1012
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:20,414
You can't spend
the rest of your life goofing off.

1013
01:03:20,451 --> 01:03:23,978
I'm 17 years old. Why is everyone
in such a hurry for me to grow up?

1014
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:28,424
Everybody else your age realizes
it's time to start planning their lives.

1015
01:03:30,027 --> 01:03:32,291
You know, I don't wanna be
like everybody else.

1016
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,924
Well, if you're not,
you're gonna be left behind.

1017
01:03:34,965 --> 01:03:37,900
Everybody else will be married
and in good steadyjobs,

1018
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:40,927
while you're still trying to decide
what you want to be.

1019
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:44,965
- Do you wanna be some kind of freak?
- A freak?

1020
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:46,977
Why am I a freak?

1021
01:03:47,011 --> 01:03:49,639
Look, every time somebody
wants to do something different,

1022
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,773
you shrinks
classify them as crazy.

1023
01:03:51,816 --> 01:03:54,717
Half the kids my age say
they're gonna do something

1024
01:03:54,752 --> 01:03:56,310
and they're not gonna
end up doing it.

1025
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:58,754
The ones that are gonna do it,
they're not gonna be happy.

1026
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:01,087
- That's not necessarily true.
- Are you happy?

1027
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:06,495
We're talking about you, Casey.
And I'm not saying you're crazy.

1028
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,555
You know what?
I am crazy.

1029
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:11,090
I am a fucking psychopath
and I'm proud of it.

1030
01:04:11,135 --> 01:04:13,569
I have no ambition?
I have ambition.

1031
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:17,233
- I wanna be a serial killer.
-You're not a killer, Casey.

1032
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:20,675
- It's not something you can become.
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

1033
01:04:21,712 --> 01:04:25,648
I just wish that you could take all this
knowledge about murder and death

1034
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,878
and apply it
to something more positive.

1035
01:04:27,918 --> 01:04:29,852
Positive? Positive?!

1036
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:33,721
We live in a world where a man kills
his wife and gets off scot free.

1037
01:04:33,758 --> 01:04:36,727
Teenagers are having babies
and throwing them in dumpsters.

1038
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:39,855
My father is getting shot
by a bank robber.

1039
01:04:39,897 --> 01:04:44,231
- How positive do you want me to be?
- Casey! Casey!

1040
01:04:46,237 --> 01:04:47,829
Yo, Casey,
where have you been, man?

1041
01:04:47,872 --> 01:04:50,966
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- I got to get the hell out of here.

1042
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:53,238
I've got that information
that you asked for.

1043
01:04:53,277 --> 01:04:55,438
Vince Grimaldi lives
in a small apartment

1044
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:57,276
on Gayhouse Lane with his mother.

1045
01:04:57,314 --> 01:05:00,442
Twice he tried to become a cop,
but he failed the examination.

1046
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:02,884
Twice. You know,
that is not that unusual.

1047
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,684
A lot of people fail
that psychological stuff.

1048
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:08,157
But this,
this is unusual, man!

1049
01:05:08,192 --> 01:05:09,454
- Check this out!
- What is it?

1050
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:11,984
See, this is some information
that you did not ask for.

1051
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:15,396
You see, I dug a little deeper
and came up with this shit right here.

1052
01:05:16,634 --> 01:05:19,603
Grimaldi was in a mental institution
when he was a teenager.

1053
01:05:19,637 --> 01:05:22,071
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah.

1054
01:05:22,106 --> 01:05:24,040
This motherfucker
killed his grandparents?

1055
01:05:24,074 --> 01:05:25,063
Yeah.

1056
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:27,509
How can they let him
become a teacher? It doesn't--

1057
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:30,844
I know. His mother, she convinced them
to seal his file when he turned 18.

1058
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:32,576
I guess they thought
they cured him.

1059
01:05:34,118 --> 01:05:37,747
- How did you get this if the file was--
- Don't worry about it, man.

1060
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:42,248
I just get into the mental health
main frame using a CIA hub.

1061
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:44,124
I just hack that shit.
So, it's no big deal.

1062
01:05:44,161 --> 01:05:47,096
- I owe you one... seriously.
- I know how you can repay me.

1063
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:50,032
Take some C-4
and blow this motherfucker up.

1064
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:53,093
Fucking boom! Fuck!

1065
01:05:53,137 --> 01:05:56,265
C-4, man.
That's the shit, man.

1066
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:01,673
I've got the skill to kill.

1067
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:09,744
I've got the urge to purge?

1068
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,758
Fuck!

1069
01:06:29,874 --> 01:06:32,001
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

1070
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:35,534
- You're just sitting there.
- What do you want me to do?

1071
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,911
I don't know.

1072
01:06:37,948 --> 01:06:41,179
- Run away from me, I guess.
- Okay.

1073
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:44,337
What's wrong?

1074
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:48,374
Amil dug up info on Grimaldi.
This guy's a psycho, Sasha.

1075
01:07:48,419 --> 01:07:51,217
- He's killed people before.
- Oh, come on.

1076
01:07:51,255 --> 01:07:53,746
They wouldn't let a murderer
be a high school teacher.

1077
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:56,259
They don't know.
His files were sealed.

1078
01:07:56,293 --> 01:07:59,592
All the research we've done
points directly to him.

1079
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,793
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1080
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,996
Don't do anything
stupid, okay?

1081
01:08:06,036 --> 01:08:08,470
Why don't you call that cop?

1082
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:13,074
That guy is almost about as big
as an asshole as Grimaldi is.

1083
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:15,840
I'm kind of exposing myself.

1084
01:08:15,879 --> 01:08:18,780
If there's one person I could kill,
it would be Grimaldi.

1085
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:24,179
You know, it's getting late.
We really should go.

1086
01:08:24,221 --> 01:08:25,654
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

1087
01:08:27,324 --> 01:08:29,554
You tried
to commit suicide?

1088
01:08:29,593 --> 01:08:31,857
Why didn't you tell me?

1089
01:08:31,895 --> 01:08:34,386
It's nothing I like
to brag about, okay?

1090
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:39,024
- What-- I mean--
- I screwed it up.

1091
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:43,932
- The first time...
- The first time?

1092
01:08:43,974 --> 01:08:47,671
I swallowed a--
a bottle of pills.

1093
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,509
And then a month ago,
I slit my wrists.

1094
01:08:50,547 --> 01:08:52,276
And I screwed it up.

1095
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:54,284
Why?

1096
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,651
I just get depressed.

1097
01:08:59,356 --> 01:09:01,551
And I don't have anyone to talk to.

1098
01:09:01,592 --> 01:09:03,719
My parents are always out
making money or something.

1099
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:06,787
It's not like I have all these friends.
I'm not some pom-pom cheerleader.

1100
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,094
- So, this was all bullshit?
- No, Casey--

1101
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:12,068
You couldn't kill yourself, so you had
to get me to do the job for you?

1102
01:09:12,102 --> 01:09:13,694
All the research, the practice,

1103
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:16,331
you were just manipulating me
to get what you wanted from me.

1104
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:18,898
You lied to me, Sasha.
This whole thing was a lie!

1105
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:20,933
- Well, it was a lie at first--
- I trusted you!

1106
01:09:22,112 --> 01:09:25,206
Yeah, “Let me be your first victim
so I can become famous.“

1107
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:27,444
I can't believe
I listened to that bullshit!

1108
01:09:27,484 --> 01:09:28,644
Casey, wait!

1109
01:09:28,686 --> 01:09:31,211
- Ray, Ray...
- Yeah?

1110
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:32,813
You are not gonna
believe this.

1111
01:09:32,856 --> 01:09:36,292
Rose Wyman was found dead in her room
at the Palms nursing home this morning.

1112
01:09:36,326 --> 01:09:40,456
Okay, that's sad, but guess
who was the last person to see her?

1113
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:44,330
- I'm on it.
- Ha!

1114
01:10:01,685 --> 01:10:03,516
( knock on door)

1115
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:13,861
-You're Mrs. Noland?
- Yes.

1116
01:10:13,897 --> 01:10:15,922
Detective Raymond Berro.

1117
01:10:22,906 --> 01:10:25,704
A woman died
in an old age home last night,

1118
01:10:25,743 --> 01:10:29,736
and it seems that your son was
the last person she spoke to.

1119
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,272
You can't possibly think that Casey
could have something to do with that.

1120
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:36,411
Hey, looks like she died
of a heart failure.

1121
01:10:36,453 --> 01:10:38,785
But I still need
to question your son.

1122
01:10:43,694 --> 01:10:45,662
Grimaldi's got Sasha!
Let's go!

1123
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:49,756
- Go where?
- Where? I don't know-- his house.

1124
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,928
You think he takes girls to kill them
at his mom's crappy little apartment?

1125
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,370
Where would he go?

1126
01:10:55,405 --> 01:10:58,704
How the hell am I supposed to know?
You're the one that did the research.

1127
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:01,040
- Casey: Shit!
- He's not here.

1128
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:04,946
- He's probably at the neighbor's.
- Which neighbor?

1129
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:09,109
- The Feldmans, next door.
- Mm-hmm.

1130
01:11:09,153 --> 01:11:13,089
All right. Umm...
There was a guy named Beswick

1131
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:16,115
and he used to take his victims
to the basement of his factory.

1132
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,391
- So?
- The school! Go to the school!

1133
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:27,003
Hey, kids!

1134
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,016
I hope we're not too late.

1135
01:11:52,362 --> 01:11:54,330
Shit!
It's locked.

1136
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:57,031
Stand back.

1137
01:11:58,101 --> 01:11:59,864
What the hell is that?

1138
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,667
C-4.
I told you it'd come handy.

1139
01:12:02,706 --> 01:12:05,675
- What? You carry it around with you?
- Never leave home without it.

1140
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:07,643
You militia fuck!

1141
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:14,680
Is it “blue to red“
or “red to green“?

1142
01:12:17,654 --> 01:12:19,645
( laughs )

1143
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:26,029
- ( clock rings)
- Oh shit!

1144
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,996
Shit!

1145
01:12:39,243 --> 01:12:42,440
-Amil!
- Blue to yellow.

1146
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:44,640
It was blue to yellow.

1147
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:47,377
- It was awesome.
- Probably got to get you to a hospital.

1148
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:50,079
No, no. I'm fine.

1149
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,113
- I'm fine. Just go save Sasha.
- All right.

1150
01:12:56,593 --> 01:12:58,584
( gasping )

1151
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,834
The office.

1152
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:16,768
- What happened, kid?
- It was beautiful.

1153
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:05,687
Okay, I put about
350 pounds on here.

1154
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:08,789
- ( grunts )
-You know I'm gonna kill you later.

1155
01:14:08,832 --> 01:14:11,699
But at least you'll have
the firmest buttocks in the morgue.

1156
01:14:54,044 --> 01:14:55,375
Well, well...

1157
01:14:55,412 --> 01:15:00,509
if it isn't my favorite sissy boy,
Casey Noland.

1158
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,814
What the hell happened
to your southern accent?

1159
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:06,289
My southern accent?
I just decided...

1160
01:15:06,323 --> 01:15:07,915
to stop doing it.

1161
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:20,800
Take care now.

1162
01:15:42,025 --> 01:15:43,253
Casey?

1163
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:45,959
Casey?

1164
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:53,196
Casey, what are you doing
with all these tools?

1165
01:15:53,236 --> 01:15:56,137
This ain't “Home Improvement,“ boy!

1166
01:15:57,841 --> 01:15:59,240
Casey?

1167
01:16:07,684 --> 01:16:11,245
Casey! Casey!

1168
01:16:11,288 --> 01:16:13,552
Don't let me catch you!

1169
01:16:18,895 --> 01:16:21,989
Casey.
Did you fall down?

1170
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,991
You know, it's a shame
I'm gonna have to kill you.

1171
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:28,561
I was looking forward to you
being the first student ever

1172
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:31,039
to fail gymnasium class.

1173
01:16:31,074 --> 01:16:33,668
I dug up the papers
about your past.

1174
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:37,168
- Everybody's gonna find out about you.
- Not if you're dead.

1175
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:41,843
- Put down the knife, Vince.
- Ray!

1176
01:16:41,885 --> 01:16:44,649
I am so happy you're here.

1177
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,657
You know, I caught the kid red-handed,
and he tried to kill me.

1178
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:50,854
- He's full of shit.
- Vince...

1179
01:16:50,894 --> 01:16:52,953
I need you to put down the knife.

1180
01:16:52,996 --> 01:16:55,658
No problem, Ray.

1181
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:58,190
You know me,
law-abiding citizen, huh?

1182
01:16:59,803 --> 01:17:01,930
- Casey: Look out!
- Ah!

1183
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:10,674
Nothing personal, Ray.

1184
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:14,878
Ouch!

1185
01:17:16,987 --> 01:17:20,923
Casey, did you say goodbye
to detective Berro?

1186
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:29,125
Casey, stop.

1187
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:31,225
See, now that you've run away,

1188
01:17:31,268 --> 01:17:33,395
I'm just gonna have to cut
your heart out,

1189
01:17:33,436 --> 01:17:37,133
show it to you
and make a hand puppet, huh?

1190
01:17:40,777 --> 01:17:42,335
Casey?

1191
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:46,639
Casey,

1192
01:17:46,683 --> 01:17:50,414
you forgot to say good night
to Detective Gurgling-on-his-own-blood.

1193
01:17:50,453 --> 01:17:52,114
( laughs )

1194
01:17:52,155 --> 01:17:54,123
Casey!

1195
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:58,959
Just show yourself, you idiot.
You know I'm gonna find you.

1196
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:01,658
Case'!

1197
01:18:06,169 --> 01:18:08,797
Well, you get an “A"
for rope climbing skills,

1198
01:18:08,838 --> 01:18:11,500
but an “F" for hiding places.

1199
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:13,941
You stupid imbecile,
did you actually think

1200
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:17,913
I wouldn't see you hanging from a rope
in the middle of a big, empty room?

1201
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:20,143
Get your ass down here.

1202
01:18:22,686 --> 01:18:26,349
Casey! Get your ass
down here!

1203
01:18:27,357 --> 01:18:29,052
(coughing)

1204
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:32,153
I gotta hand it to you,
Colombo.

1205
01:18:32,195 --> 01:18:35,130
That was a pretty impressive
detective work on your part.

1206
01:18:35,165 --> 01:18:38,965
-You killed a cop. You're finished.
- Oh, I'm finished?

1207
01:18:39,002 --> 01:18:42,995
You think they actually are going
to suspect their drinking buddy?

1208
01:18:45,175 --> 01:18:48,406
You asshole! You're the one
that's been bragging for two weeks

1209
01:18:48,445 --> 01:18:52,142
that you wanna be a serial killer.
Who do you think they're gonna believe?

1210
01:18:52,182 --> 01:18:54,013
You could teach me
how to be a serial killer.

1211
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:57,717
What!?

1212
01:18:57,754 --> 01:18:59,745
Casey, you're a girl.

1213
01:18:59,789 --> 01:19:01,950
You have to be a man
to be a serial killer.

1214
01:19:06,296 --> 01:19:09,390
I know everything. The bodies,
you turn them into furniture.

1215
01:19:09,432 --> 01:19:11,923
You depersonalize them--
inanimate objects.

1216
01:19:11,968 --> 01:19:13,936
You wanna feel
like you own these girls.

1217
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,871
Like-- like they're
your possessions.

1218
01:19:16,906 --> 01:19:18,703
Possessions?

1219
01:19:18,742 --> 01:19:20,710
God damn it!

1220
01:19:20,744 --> 01:19:24,373
You have completely bought
into this touchy-feely horseshit

1221
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:26,575
that they're teaching you
in psychotherapy.

1222
01:19:26,616 --> 01:19:29,210
i don't want 'em as possessions.

1223
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:33,518
I'm just trying to rid society
of some of its filth. That's all.

1224
01:19:33,556 --> 01:19:37,652
Yeah, I took a shotgun and killed
my grandmother and grandfather,

1225
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:40,356
but! was doing them a favor.

1226
01:19:40,397 --> 01:19:42,524
And then I get sent off
to a mental hospital,

1227
01:19:42,565 --> 01:19:44,260
where they thought
they could cure me.

1228
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:46,235
They didn't do
a very good job.

1229
01:19:46,269 --> 01:19:49,261
No, they didn't,
'cause I don't have a disease.

1230
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:51,274
I'm the one who's healthy.

1231
01:19:51,308 --> 01:19:54,072
It's the rest of society
that is diseased.

1232
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:56,237
Look at these girls
in gym class...

1233
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:59,510
with their breasts bulging out
and their tight little shorts on.

1234
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:03,178
They're just gonna
grow up to be whores

1235
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:06,950
and sluts,
and real estate agents.

1236
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,322
You've been rejected
by girls your whole life.

1237
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:12,385
What teenage girl wants to be
with some lame-ass gym teacher?

1238
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:14,863
First of all, fuck you.

1239
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:18,197
Second of all,
this conversation is over,

1240
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:20,498
'cause I'm gonna
kill you now

1241
01:20:20,537 --> 01:20:22,630
and turn you
into a piece of furniture.

1242
01:20:25,642 --> 01:20:27,974
( saw whirring stops )

1243
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:30,002
( laughs )
You are so pathetic.

1244
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:32,742
You bring a power tool

1245
01:20:32,782 --> 01:20:36,149
to kill your gym coach
and you don't get good batteries?

1246
01:20:37,721 --> 01:20:40,053
What do you intend to do with that?
Scratch me to death?

1247
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:43,116
Huh? You can't throw it.

1248
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:45,957
You throw
like a fucking girl!

1249
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:49,732
Not anymore.

1250
01:20:51,801 --> 01:20:55,202
I had a damn fine
gymnasium class coach.

1251
01:21:01,845 --> 01:21:06,873
Good throw... bad catch.

1252
01:21:08,218 --> 01:21:10,186
Sasha.

1253
01:21:26,603 --> 01:21:28,867
It's over.
Grimaldi's dead.

1254
01:21:30,106 --> 01:21:32,870
Yeah. I'm all right.
How about you?

1255
01:21:32,909 --> 01:21:35,377
I'll be okay.
Did he touch you?

1256
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:37,846
No, but he said he wanted
to make me into a coffee table.

1257
01:21:37,881 --> 01:21:40,213
After this, you still don't wanna
kill yourself, do you?

1258
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,239
No.

1259
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:43,343
I don't think I'm cut off
to be a serial killer.

1260
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:45,354
It doesn't matter.

1261
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:57,262
- What do you think?
- This is so good.

1262
01:21:58,268 --> 01:22:00,862
God, I wish
your dad was here.

1263
01:22:00,904 --> 01:22:03,134
He'd be so proud of you.

1264
01:22:04,407 --> 01:22:07,103
So, ifl have a problem with Mr. Korn,
you're gonna back me up?

1265
01:22:07,143 --> 01:22:10,510
You bet. You're
on the right track now, guy.

1266
01:22:10,547 --> 01:22:13,345
Thanks, Mom.

1267
01:22:13,383 --> 01:22:15,578
I love you, honey.

1268
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:22,323
I simulated the whole fetal pig
dissection. It's totally interactive.

1269
01:22:22,358 --> 01:22:25,225
Casey, this is great!
I can use this in all my classes.

1270
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:27,252
So?

1271
01:22:27,297 --> 01:22:29,288
I'm giving you an “A.“

1272
01:22:29,332 --> 01:22:32,165
It's great to see you
take more interest in school.

1273
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:33,897
Killer.

1274
01:22:36,105 --> 01:22:40,804
I believe the next individual to go up
and speak would be Mr. Casey Noland.

1275
01:22:49,118 --> 01:22:51,450
This should prove to be
very interesting, Mr. Noland.

1276
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:54,924
Because your grade
in this class hinges on this paper.

1277
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:58,689
My paper is entitled,
“Serial Killing for Dummies.“

1278
01:23:01,531 --> 01:23:03,965
“A serial murderer
is like a hunter,

1279
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,968
he must always be
on the hunt,

1280
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:09,597
looking for the victim, the opportunity,
who is most vulnerable.

1281
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:15,567
As an agent in the FBI's national center
for analysis of violent crime,

1282
01:23:15,612 --> 01:23:17,637
I will have to put myself
in the position of a hunter

1283
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,580
of a serial offender.

1284
01:23:19,616 --> 01:23:22,847
I've got to be able to profile
my potential prey,

1285
01:23:22,886 --> 01:23:24,581
determine what
his next move is...

1286
01:23:24,621 --> 01:23:27,454
...detectives and crime scene analysts
take a number of unrelated clues

1287
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:29,685
and turn them
into a coherent narrative.

1288
01:23:29,726 --> 01:23:32,422
They're telling a story
that victims can no longer tell.

1289
01:23:32,462 --> 01:23:36,455
As John Douglas explains,
if you want to understand the artist,

1290
01:23:36,499 --> 01:23:38,467
you must look
at the paintings.“

1291
01:23:52,982 --> 01:23:56,645
That was fly, Mr. Noland.
You got yourself an “A.“

1292
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:09,828
Motherfucking kids!

1293
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:12,334
Killing the goddamned
teachers.

1294
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:15,599
( laughs )
Un-fucking-believable, yeah!

1295
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:17,833
And you know...

1296
01:24:17,874 --> 01:24:20,570
who's gonna have to clean up
this fucking shit, right?

1297
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,544
The head...

1298
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:25,673
fucking custodian,
that's who, yeah.

1299
01:24:25,715 --> 01:24:29,310
Fucking tater tots,

1300
01:24:29,352 --> 01:24:33,118
and blood,
blood, and tater tots.

1301
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:35,954
Jesus Christ!
( sighs )

1302
01:24:35,992 --> 01:24:38,290
I gotta see some titties later.

1303
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:40,421
I got titties on my mind here.

1304
01:24:40,463 --> 01:24:44,126
Yeah, what do they care?
What the fuck, huh?

1305
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,135
Sure, sure, sure.

1306
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:49,661
They just make fun
of me, right?

1307
01:24:49,706 --> 01:24:53,107
Make fun of the job.
I'm just a dummy.

1308
01:24:53,142 --> 01:24:56,441
“Look at the dummy clean it up.
The dummy will clean it up.“

1309
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,811
Yeah, well.
Fuck them, huh?

1310
01:24:58,848 --> 01:25:02,875
I'm gonna kill
all those fuckers. Yeah.

1311
01:25:02,919 --> 01:25:05,888
Yeah, serial killing, uh-huh.
(laughs)

1312
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:08,390
Yeah, that's for dummies.
( laughing )

1313
01:25:10,727 --> 01:25:13,321
It's for dummies.

1314
01:25:22,605 --> 01:25:25,199
♫ Buried my own head ♫

1315
01:25:26,576 --> 01:25:29,568
♫ Buried my own dead ♫

1316
01:25:30,613 --> 01:25:33,207
♫ Buried my own brain ♫

1317
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:38,084
♫ And met her
in there yesterday ♫

1318
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:41,613
♫ Hiding my own fears ♫

1319
01:25:41,658 --> 01:25:45,958
♫ Hiding all these years ♫

1320
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:49,089
♫ Hiding my own brain ♫

1321
01:25:49,132 --> 01:25:55,264
♫ And hiding my yesterday ♫

1322
01:25:55,304 --> 01:25:57,795
♫ Whatlknow,
