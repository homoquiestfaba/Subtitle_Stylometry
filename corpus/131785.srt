01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,388
TO START
MY POKÉMON JOURNEY,

1278
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,890
I SAW A REALLY RARE
POKÉMON,

1279
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,891
AND JUST NOW,

1280
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,893
I THOUGHT I SAW
ANOTHER ONE.

1281
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,896
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST SEEING THINGS, ASH.

1282
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:01,897
HUH?

1283
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:02,898
WELL, MAYBE HE'S NOT.

THE JOURNEY'S
JUST BEGUN.

1294
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,427
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
HOW WE GOT HERE,
