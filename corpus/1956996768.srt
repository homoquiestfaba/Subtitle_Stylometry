182
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,273
Joe Morgan.

183
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,579
Yeah.

184
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,104
Third?

185
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,540
Third.

186
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,283
Third. Uh...

187
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:51,591
Third.
I know this one. I do.

188
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:52,809
Uh...

189
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,332
[thinking]
Mike Schmidt.

190
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:57,466
Come on. Are you joking?

191
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,076
Say it.

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,338
Um...

193
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,645
Say "Mike Schmidt."

194
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,082
I had it in my head
just then.

195
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,824
Every American kid
in the world

196
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,392
knows Mike Schmidt.

197
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:13,438
Uh...
Are you kidding me?

198
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,658
Mike fucking Schmidt,
man!

199
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:17,921
Ron Cey.

200
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:23,187
No. It's not Ron Cey.

201
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,859
[James chuckles]
Shit.

202
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,469
Come on.

203
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,179
I'll get you a new ball.

204
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,010
[panting]

205
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:06,187
Did... Did you say something,
James?

206
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,406
Are you all right in there?

207
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,757
Yeah, I'm fine.

208
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,803
Lord save us.
[muttering]

209
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,239
[Mary]
Where's me paper?

210
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:18,025
I swear to God,
that gobshite paper boy

211
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:20,636
is out smoking weed
with his criminal friends

212
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,683
instead of delivering papers
to decent people.

213
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,989
I've got it in here.

214
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,774
You know I forbid that.

215
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,427
How long have you
been in there

216
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:30,733
polluting my paper?

217
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,343
Since half past 4.

218
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:35,129
Seems the constipation's
got the better of him.

219
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,696
Jesus, James.

220
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,262
Three quarters of an hour
doing your business?

221
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,264
Broccoli hasn't been
doing the trick.

222
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,136
Why, it could be
the problem.

223
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,747
I can only s-speak for meself,

224
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,880
but I'm as right as rain.

225
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,795
Ah, for God's sake,
shut up.

226
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,536
Try to breathe, James,
in and out.

227
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,061
In and out.

228
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,890
He's not giving birth,
for God's sake!

229
00:11:56,933 --> 00:12:00,720
James, you shove my newspaper
out under that door

230
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,851
and quit this nonsense.

231
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,679
It's simple truth.

232
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,638
There is no worse place
in the world to jerk off

233
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,771
than Ireland.[pounding on door]

234
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,513
James! Give me me paper!

235
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,384
Must be God's will.

236
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,303
16 times, Father.

237
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,436
[panting]11 times, Father.

238
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,438
18 times, Father.

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,964
...since your last
confession, my son?

240
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,793
Since Friday, Father.

241
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,157
Only out of respect
for my mom I still come here.

242
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,290
God has no use for me.

243
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,555
I occasionally
have a use for him.

244
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,170
[sports announcer on radio]

245
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:13,009
New York is down by 3
here in the second.

246
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,751
It's a beautiful day
here at Flushing.

247
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,666
Not a cloud in the sky.

248
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,105
Hey, Charlie.

249
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,715
How's business?

250
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,326
Oh, business ain't
too bad now.

251
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,722
What'll it be, gents?

252
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,029
Two pints.

253
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,378
That'll be a pound.

254
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:35,989
A pound?

255
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,208
Happy Hour.
Being new customers.

256
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,951
But we're the only ones here.

257
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,779
And we're always here.

258
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,607
Aye.

259
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,052
You ever notice
that nobody asks anybody

260
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,011
what they are around here?

261
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,534
No.

262
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:02,232
In America, people ask
people what they are,

263
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,105
and people say
"Oh, I'm half German"

264
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,584
or "I'm half Italian"

265
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,717
or "I'm a quarter this
or that or whatever."

266
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,372
Yeah?

267
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,417
People don't do that here.

268
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:18,248
Well, maybe because everyone
here are all Irish.

269
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,251
Not us.

270
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,036
We're not?

271
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,603
No. That's
what I'm getting at.

272
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,955
In America, we're Irish.

273
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:31,348
We're 100%...

274
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,573
Right.

275
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,272
[bell rings]

276
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,886
£2.

277
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:47,974
2?

278
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:50,454
Happy Hour's over, so...

279
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,457
We ordered
before it ended, so...

280
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,850
You just waited.

281
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,808
You can't rush a pint, boy.

282
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,071
You should order the whiskey

283
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,073
if you was
in so much of a hurry.

284
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,075
Right, Timmy?

285
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,468
I'm Irish.

286
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,777
[sigh]
We got to get out of here.

287
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,213
Okay.

288
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:19,483
How?

289
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,491
I'm 16 years old.

290
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:30,451
I quit school six months ago.

291
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,496
That's Bill. He's a bookie.

292
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,151
Bill the Bookie
is what they call him.

293
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,023
Clever.

294
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,068
I'm doing what you'd
call an internship,

295
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,113
I suppose.

296
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,679
[chatter]

297
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,116
Bill's a strong man

298
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,813
with strong opinions
about people,

299
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,641
but it's rare when you
know what they are,

300
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,034
which is why he's dangerous.

301
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,123
I have no idea
how he feels about me.

302
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,256
Obviously, I don't ever do
any of the muscle work.

303
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,867
That's what
the other Bill's for.

304
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,130
Aah!

305
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,145
He's a moron and an asshole,

306
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,451
too stupid for Bill
not to trust,

307
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,366
so he's good.

308
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,978
They call him
Bill the Breaker.

309
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,718
[crowd cheering]

310
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,209
So a fine one
you got there, James.

311
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,211
You at least
get a good shot in?

312
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,692
Not really.

313
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,741
Ah. It's the little fucker.

314
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,005
Ah, keep quiet there,
Bill. I'm busy.

315
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,746
You know, this little fellow
didn't even get a look in.

316
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,619
You don't say.
I could have told you that.

317
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:53,055
What do you mean, Billy?

318
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,101
Well, your man here
is a complete pussy.

319
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,190
It's my boy he fought.

320
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,843
But don't underestimate
him, Bill.

321
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,236
He hurt me boy, too.

322
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,325
You should have
used his hands.

323
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:04,023
Must have used his hands
a hundred times

324
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,415
against that head of his.

325
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,637
Always with the jokes.

326
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,162
[singing]Fuck off.

327
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:14,990
That's enough, boys.

328
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,689
You know, James...

329
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,563
you remind me of meself
a bit.

330
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,957
Reminds me of how I earned
a reputation worth keeping.

331
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,264
Getting your arse
kicked around all day?

332
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,701
When I left Cranny,

333
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,094
I was maybe 11.

334
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,009
I was a little shite, too.

335
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,967
And I knew Limerick
was a rough town.

336
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,361
Ah, rough town.
That weren't a rough town.

337
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:40,885
In Cranny, your worst beating
would have come from your ma.

338
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,670
Cranny, not a rough town.

339
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,367
Should never admit
that, Bill. [laughing]

340
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,890
What are you, Jerry Lewis?

341
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:46,891
Go fetch me a pint, will you?

342
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,589
Thirsty.

343
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,680
So my father says to me
before he left,

344
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:55,335
he says, "If you're
going to get into a row,

345
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,250
"which is unavoidable
in Limerick,

346
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:00,079
don't go fighting a guy
who fucked with you."

347
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,123
And I said...

348
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,691
"What you mean by that, Da?"

349
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:06,520
And he says...
for effect, I suppose,

350
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,391
so I'd remember it, you know.

351
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:09,436
Yeah.

352
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,829
Whispers in me ear,

353
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,658
then he kisses me
on the cheek,

354
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,660
and off I go.

355
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,097
What did he whisper?

356
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,272
I'm... I'm getting there.

357
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,537
Sure enough,
second day I was there,

358
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,408
I met up with a gang
of fucking toughs

359
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,149
who were out to start.

360
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,195
A lad maybe my size come up

361
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,501
and give me a box in the head
for no reason

362
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,199
other than I fucking
happened to be there.

363
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,463
He's just standing there

364
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,769
with his shit-eating grin
across his ugly mug.

365
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,903
So I get up off the path.

366
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,645
And I run.

367
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,517
But not away.

368
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,432
I raced straight past
the fucker who smacked me,

369
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,260
and I jump in the air.

370
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:54,176
So now I haven't a clue
what to do next.

371
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,397
On top of this guy,
staring right at him,

372
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,094
face to face.

373
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,966
[crunch]
Aah!

374
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,797
And you won the fight.

375
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,669
No, they beat the shit
out of me.

376
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,671
I was laid up in St. Joe's
for two weeks.

377
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,890
But they never ever
fucked with me again.

378
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:18,461
That's a fine story.

379
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,898
It's not a story.

380
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,945
But there is a lesson
in what me father told me.

381
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,817
He said real quiet,

382
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,690
"Go after the biggest,

383
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,432
and the others
will run like hell."

384
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,744
Tom.

385
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,921
Your man, Tom, by the river.

386
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:44,966
Uh-huh.

387
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,620
He owes me 3.40.

388
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,883
Overdue.

389
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,928
It's the last time
you visit.

390
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,762
In the meantime,
you go to the police,

391
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:01,200
you tell them no,

392
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:05,465
and the same goes
for the boys at the bank.

393
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,468
Got it.

394
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,821
Where are you going
to be tonight?

395
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:14,952
Mackey's with Pete.

396
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,041
How's your man Petey?

397
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,217
Fine.

398
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,092
Ah, he's a good boy,

399
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,920
just like you,

400
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:28,531
but a teeny bit happier.

401
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,186
He'll get over it.

402
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:34,233
Couple of pints on me.

403
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,124
Did you know this is
where Bill and his boys

404
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:59,127
take the guys
who can't pay?

405
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,001
The scary thing is

406
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:06,265
they don't know
what they're going to do.

407
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,314
[cough]

408
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,403
You know,
sometimes we just talk

409
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,883
about dogs and races,

410
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,320
and they get pints
from the pub,

411
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,322
and sometimes they...

412
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,150
sometimes they just...

413
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,458
rough the guy up a bit.

414
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,027
Just, you know...

415
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,856
every now and again.[cough]

416
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,383
Here.

417
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,487
Hey, look what I found.

418
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,098
the New York Mets.

419
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:09,545
When we get back,
you can trade this

420
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,374
for box seats on me.

421
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,563
[clatter]

422
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,306
See? Huh?

423
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,396
Can't you be decent
about it just this once, huh?

424
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,442
You cheap fecking Jew, ya.

425
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:40,054
You know, try... try
to be a decent Irishman
about it, huh?

426
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:41,272
You half-breed.

427
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,187
Half-breed.

428
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:45,059
My father's from Wicklow.

429
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,800
Huh? And your mam
is from where?

430
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:47,975
Tyrone.
Aha.

431
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,324
We've been over this.

432
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,761
Yeah. Here. Have a go.

433
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,069
No one likes Tom much...

434
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,593
Loosen your grip. ...except me.

435
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,203
I don't know.
Maybe it's because

436
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,118
he reminds me of my dearly
departed dad,

437
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,164
or maybe it's because no one
likes me much, either.

438
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,470
You're holding that
like a girl.

439
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:06,036
Either way, I like him.

440
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,647
You can't listen
to what he says,

441
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,040
but what he means.
No one ever gets that.

442
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,607
Anyway,
you know the rules, Tom.

443
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,479
Bill's not going to do that.

444
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:15,524
Ah, feck the rules.

445
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:19,223
That no-good Bill's
as shifty as a Chinaman.

446
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,922
Here. be careful.

447
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,837
If you lose my hook,

448
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,882
I'll stick my shoe
so far up your arse,

449
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,623
you'll taste the cow shite.

450
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,501
Ah, for feck's sake.
Here, give me that.

451
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,067
Jesus.

452
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,895
That's enough of that.

453
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,424
Look... will you?

454
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,208
Uh, do you know
the dog's name?

455
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:52,648
Yeah. I got it.

456
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,868
Tom. Heh.

457
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:55,912
But it's a...

458
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,483
...then he'll let you
next time,

459
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,833
but you can't,
so I can't.

460
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,053
You shouldn't be fucking
betting anymore, Tom.

461
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:09,796
You watch your mouth,
you little fecker.

462
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,885
You say fuck
all the time.

463
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,714
I do not. I say feck,

464
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,107
which is an entirely
different matter altogether.

465
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,936
You say "potayto,"
I say "potahto."

466
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,330
There's a potato
up your asshole.

467
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,027
Forget it.

468
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,160
Look.

469
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,162
I'm as smart as ten Bills
put together,

470
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,251
and besides,
I am a man of my word.

471
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,297
I'm just concerned.

472
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,952
Well, you leave
the concern to me.

473
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:39,956
Anyway, that Bill's
as thick as a Polack.

474
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,828
I thought he was
as cheap as a Jew.

475
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:43,525
He is.

476
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,788
How do you know so much
about these people, Tom...

477
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:48,051
Jews and Polacks
and Chinamen...

478
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,967
when you've
never left this town?

479
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:53,927
Listen, you're my friend,

480
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,624
and I think
you should quit betting.

481
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,496
Friend?

482
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,149
I'm 40 years older than you.

483
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,761
How can I be your friend,
you little scut, you.

484
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:06,679
Here.

485
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,119
Ring that number.

486
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:15,296
Tell him to come over
to see me after tea tomorrow.

487
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,690
You'll have your money
in two days.

488
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,126
Fine.

489
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,782
I'm not going to fight.

490
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:26,307
See you.

491
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,353
Fecker couldn't catch a cold
with Bill... [muttering]

493
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,449
Hey, Shane.

494
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:39,538
How are you?

495
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,322
I'm good. How are you?

496
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,453
Good.

497
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,631
Not so good anymore.

498
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,154

If I ever want to make it
back to America,

512
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:33,330
I'm not going to do it

513
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:34,854
on the shit money
I'm making now.

514
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,290
So I've constructed

515
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,639
a thoughtful
comprehensive list

516
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:38,640
of all my...

517
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,526
Any luck?

518
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,487
Uh, the boys at the bank
are square.

519
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,708
O'Connor's paid up,
footing out his kid.

520
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:06,189
Um, everyone
in Greystone's is paid.

521
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:09,236
Father O'Hara is 40 short,

522
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,500
but he offered
to make that up in novenas.

523
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,545
Hmm. That's a fine trade-off.

524
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:18,071
Better pray I don't
come back for me 40.

525
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:19,986
So that's...

526
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:21,552
480 for today

527
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,511
and no work for Bill.

528
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,863
And I have to see
Paulick by the lake.

529
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,778
And Tom by the river.

530
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,388
Yeah. I know.

531
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,958
Maybe Bill will have
some work after all.

532
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,960
I thought
you said three weeks.

533
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,658
Oh, I know what I said.

534
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,622
Something else?

535
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,016
Um...

536
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:52,801
If you're asking
for more money,

537
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,673
I've got 20 lads
lined up for your job.

538
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:55,935
No.

539
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,783
Hello.

540
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,741
Jesus.

541
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:23,745
Knock before you come in,
not as you come in, Maggie.

542
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,529
Sick, are you?

543
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:26,748
Yeah, a little.

544
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,750
Is it drink?

545
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,752
Oh, James, try and stay
off the drink.

546
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,536
You're a young boy.

547
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,973
No, it's not the drink.

548
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,584
I think I have a cramp
or a stomachache.

549
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:39,195
Oh, you're not fooling me.

550
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,677
Your Auntie Maggie isn't
as knackered as you think.

551
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,592
I know what's going on.

552
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:47,029
I've seen you
looking at the girls.

553
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,771
I know you have a thing
for that Fiona one.

554
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:50,859
Ohh.

555
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:54,210
I was young once, too.

556
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:58,780
Paulick McKinney
was his name.

557
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,827
The sweet little face
on him.

558
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,004
The big, broad shoulders.

559
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,050
And his lovely mustache.

560
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:13,186
I'd say I did
the very same thing as you...

561
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:16,145
...the only thing
on me mind.

562
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,715
Of course, I couldn't
do what you do, mind,

563
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,848
but I know the feeling.

564
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,415
There's nothing like it.

565
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,157
So let's have a look.[swat]

566
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,202
What?

567
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:31,073
Come on, shy boy.

568
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,467
Let your old Auntie Maggie
have a look.

569
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,382
I can tell you
if she'd like it.

570
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:37,036
No.

571
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,212
All right, shy boy.

572
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:42,345
I'll leave you alone to...

573
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:45,522
Oh, so upset
over a bit of poetry.

574
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,438
I've seen you writing
in this book of yours.

575
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:51,833
Oh, now, if you want help
with a rhyme, talk to Mary.

576
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:54,140
She's a whirl with a rhyme.

577
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:57,099
What rhymes with "Fiona"?

578
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,059
[chatter outside]

579
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,805
Maggie's a bit of a boob,

580
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,589
but she's right about Fiona.

581
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:21,602
Are you expecting anyone?

582
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,258
Excuse me.

583
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,303
Are you expecting anyone?

584
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,305
No.

585
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:31,655
Thanks.

586
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,619
I'm in love with her.

587
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,991
[knock knock]

588
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,952
[knocking]

589
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:09,215
Keep your goddamn
trousers on.

590
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,903
[click]

591
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,344
[click]

592
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,912
Here.

593
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:58,090
Tell your man I want
half of that on Uncle Tom.

594
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,005
Right?
Yeah.

595
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:05,097
Talk to you soon.

596
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,316
Tom would sell
anything he owns,

597
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,752
even his boat,

598
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,232
just to keep
his awe-inspiring

599
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,017
losing streak alive.

600
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,198
He's out.

601
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,636
Where is he?

602
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,725
He said just leave it here.

603
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:31,427
No. I deliver my own.

604
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:32,689
I'll call back later.

605
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,604
Suit yourself.

606
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,609
Enough is enough.

607
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,090
I'm not living
this way no more.

608
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:45,311
Sure, who'd know better
than Dr. Fitzpatrick?

609
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:48,749
It's quite a bit of money,
don't you agree?

610
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,882
he spends his days
on the toilet,
the poor creature.

611
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:54,407
The least we could do
is send him to London.

612
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,192
London is a difficult place
for a young boy.

613
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,541
How'd he get around?

614
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,631
In a red Mercedes
sports car.

615
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,329
What do you think?

616
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,635
He'll walk.

617
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,074
Anyway, Katherine
will take him.

618
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:12,077
You better start
behaving yourself,
young fella, me lad.

619
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,558
We didn't even ask the boy
if he wanted to go.

620
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:19,649
James, would you
like to go to London?

621
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,044
So I had a choice...

622
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:26,395
some doctor probing my ass
in London,

623
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:29,094
or I could just stay here.

624
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,447
[panting]

625
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,839
[knocking]

626
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,493
You all right
in there, love?

627
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:40,148
Yeah, I'm fine.

628
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,541
England.

629
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,369
The polar opposite.

630
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,371
The diametrically opposed.

631
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:48,330
The receptive yin
to Ireland's hostile yang.

632
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:51,246
Everybody here hates Ireland
as much as I do.

633
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:00,038
So this tiny window
on my sad life,

634
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:01,561
my heart lifted.

635
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:03,041
Everything
at Aunt Katherine's

636
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,085
will be different.

637
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,130
Hi.

638
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,783
From what?

639
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:09,090
You're letting in
the goddamn cold. Get in.

640
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,092
In fact,
everything is identical.

641
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,354
Did you
take your pills?

642
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,834
They're twins.

643
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,500
I thought
Aunt Mary was awful.

644
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:30,894
Then I spent some time
with her sister Katherine.

645
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:34,463
England, Ireland,
Mary, Katherine.

646
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:37,075
It made no difference.

647
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,815
There was no hope.

648
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:45,083
Then, in my darkest hour,
I met my savior.

649
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:53,221
And he had friends, too.

650
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:56,833
White girls, black girls,
skinny and fat.

651
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,835
Asian, English,
Mexican, Indian.

652
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,446
Everyone but Irish.

653
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,361
These girls didn't
exist in Ireland

654
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:05,407
because these magazines
didn't.

655
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,781
Did you have a good day?

656
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:34,958
Fine.

657
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,396
How was yours?

658
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:39,833
Grand.

659
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:43,053
Why?

660
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,928
Don't know. You asked me.

661
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,456
[phone rings]

662
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,023
I'll get that.

663
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,721
After jerking off
for five hours

664
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,593
to the finest
in English pornography,

665
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,377
I came to realize

666
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:04,249
that maybe it provided
the one ounce of pleasure

667
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,946
I could derive
in this shitty world

668
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,687
and something I could
dedicate myself to

669
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,341
fully and honestly.

670
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,517
[Katherine
hangs up phone]

671
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,173
Dr. Fitzpatrick says
you're as fit as a fiddle.

672
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,959
You can go home
to Ireland tomorrow, so.

673
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,308
I'll phone Mary.

674
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,398
[lifting phone receiver,
dialing]

675
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,625
[Woman]
James.

676
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,933
James.

677
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,547
Open me.

678
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,202
[whispering]
Where are you?

679
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,247
You know where I am.

680
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,988
Open me.

681
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,568
Page 38.

682
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,140
Thank you, James.

683
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:13,013
Now, let's get
down to business.

684
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:19,933
Not that kind of business,
dear James.

685
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,849
Do you know why I'm here
talking to you?

686
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,505
Well, I'll tell you, then.

687
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:28,942
Please, turn the page.

688
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,554
You have your goal...

689
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:36,123
a brave and beautiful goal...

690
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,994
to get back to America,

691
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,909
but you don't know
how to get there.

692
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,564
Yeah. I don't
know how the fuck
I'm gonna...

693
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:45,698
I know, James. I know.

694
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:49,267
But watch your language
around a pretty girl.

695
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,400
What you must do
is find a way.

696
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,184
[fading echo]
Find a way, find a way...

697
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,448
It's staring you
right in the face.

698
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,536
What?

699
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,059
You like me, don't you?

700
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,756
Yes.

701
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,584
You may not be the only one.

702
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,543
[fading echo]
Only one, only one...

703
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,374
I need your help.

704
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,507
I can help.

705
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,045
Pick her up!

706
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,526
Pick her up!

707
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,528
Well, there's me old boyo.

708
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,923
Good man. Welcome home.

709
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,709
What's he doing,
scratching his arse?

710
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,885
Paddy in Rath Naoi has
160 on your man there,

711
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,844
but he wants an excuse
to visit him

712
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,585
because his dog keeps
shitting in his yard.

713
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:48,456
Dark Horse is the name.

714
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,588
Really?Mm.

715
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:55,376
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

716
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,769
Bad bet there, Billy.

717
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,339
Ah.

718
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,516
So, James, how are things?

719
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,865
London good?

720
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:08,128
Yeah. London was...

721
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,391
London was good.
Hmm.

722
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:13,133
Say, did you collect any
before you went away?

723
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:14,482
No.

724

You know, your man Tom
is in arrears, too.

737
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:25,727
I didn't see him
before I left,

Hmm. That's good, so.

Of course it might have
been your aunt

747
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,098
who made you sick
in the first place.

748

No. I just like
a little privacy.

all over town about his win.

01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,283
Come here.

1441
01:23:05,806 --> 01:23:08,200
Don't go near the trains
or the docks.

1442
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:10,072
There's guards
looking for you.

1443
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:11,247
[panting]

1444
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:12,770
You know
what you have to do.

1445
01:23:12,813 --> 01:23:13,771
No!

1446
01:23:13,814 --> 01:23:16,121
Look, I'll be fine.

1447
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:19,168
No. I'm not leaving you here.

1448
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:22,301
The secret is to keep
breathing, you see.

1449
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:24,042
[coughing]

1450
01:23:24,086 --> 01:23:26,784
I'll be fine. The guards
will be here in a minute.

1451
01:23:26,827 --> 01:23:29,352
So go. Go from here.

1452
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:30,744
[sirens in distance]

1453
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:32,790
Try and be a good boy,
will you?

1454
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:35,532
Now feck off!

1455
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,057
Go! Go,
you little fecker. Go!

1456
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:49,850
All of that over
a few naked pictures.

1457
01:24:08,478 --> 01:24:10,045
It's been a long while now.

1458
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,094
Sometimes I try to remember
what it's like back there,

1459
01:24:16,138 --> 01:24:18,096
but memories
distort everything.

1460
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,359
They're... They're
subjective and cruel.

1461
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:27,366
Still,
I can't help but wonder

1462
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,455
if things turn out
for the better

1463
01:24:29,499 --> 01:24:31,327
or the worse.

1464
01:24:33,285 --> 01:24:36,462
Most likely,
they're the same.

1465
01:24:36,506 --> 01:24:39,509
It's odd, but I don't worry
so much about Pete anymore.

1466
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,641
I finally figured out
he's smarter than me.

1467
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:42,990
He'll be okay.

1468
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:49,214
And once in a while,
I think of Fiona.

1469
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:57,048
None of that matters
because I made it...

1470
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,485
America,
the land of the free,

1471
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,183
home of the brave, all that.

1472
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,402
I can't just leave
all that I started here.

1473
01:25:03,446 --> 01:25:05,187
Things are happening.

1474
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,103
And it would be
too hard anyways,

1475
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:10,148
especially with
a rap sheet like mine...

1476
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:12,150
trafficking, gambling,

1477
01:25:12,194 --> 01:25:14,674
theft, burglary, murder.

1478
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:18,591
It's probably better
to think I'm dead.

1479
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,291
Can't go back to Ireland.

1480
01:25:25,903 --> 01:25:28,993
But, you know,
I might like to one day.

1481
01:25:30,995 --> 01:25:32,431
