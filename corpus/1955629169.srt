1
00:01:09,815 --> 00:01:11,214
Gray?

2
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:22,050
Gray?

3
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,098
I'm trying to watch.

4
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,778
- Gray?
- I'm trying to watch.

5
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,390
You're late for work.

6
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:55,655
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:58,863
What were you watching?

8
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:00,793
A peep show?

9
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:06,161
- You're mean.
- You're mean.

10
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:09,431
Good comeback. Hey, let's go
get some breakfast. Come on.

11
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:12,201
No... I have an early lunch.

12
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:14,208
With who?

13
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:17,143
It's for a film.
Some director.

14
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:21,145
Little scotch and sofa?

15
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:26,915
And... cut! Yes. Great job.
Great. Everybody good?

16
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,616
That was great for me.
Gray, how're you feeling? Good?

17
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,529
Was that good for you?

18
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,755
We can go again.
It's all about you. Cause I'm great.

19
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,297
You good? Do you wanna go again?
It was good for me.

20
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,661
Was it good for you?
Great, we can go to lunch.

21
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:25,110
"O PREÇO DO SUCESSO"
- I Love Your Work -

22
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,560
Hey, Jimmy Stewart,
take your hand out of your pants.

23
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,567
Lovely.

24
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:02,852
Hi, Mia, how are you?
This is Elvis Costello calling.

25
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:08,056
How are you? Good.
I'm in town... call me.

26
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,788
I'm in town. Did I say that? I think so.
Call me, I'm at the Four Seasons.

27
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:18,100
How bizarre!
He sounded a little nervous almost.

28
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,794
- He said he was in town five times.
- I know.

29
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,506
- Don't be mad at me.
- No, I'm not mad at you, no.

30
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,543
I'm not mad at all. It's just
that he's... whatever. He's...

31
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:31,011
He's Elvis Costello.
He thinks he can just call up.

32
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:33,810
- It's just tacky.
- Okay, Jake LaMotta.

33
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,221
So, how was your meeting?

34
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:44,053
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay.

35
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,688
Repent! Repent!

36
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,302
Talk to the press, okay?

37
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,026
Mia!

38
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:56,130
- Come on, man! Fuck you!
- Well, you know...

39
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,859
it's just a cameo.
I play a heroin dealer and...

40
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,198
I did it cause I got to wear a jump suit
and give a super model a sponge bath.

41
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:05,169
- Honey, you didn't wear a jump suit.
- Well, you know what I mean.

42
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,677
- Mia, you look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

43
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:12,850
- You're a lucky man, Gray.
- Yes, I am.

44
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,032
Mr. Gray!

45
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,938
Mia, look over here!

46
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:41,273
Mia, what are you wearing?!

47
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,075
How about a smile, Gray?
How about a kiss, guys?

48
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:54,386
- Absolutely fabulous!
- What a piece doggie doodie!

49
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:57,152
Can you believe how huge
that was at Sundance?

50
00:06:57,362 --> 00:07:00,195
Of course it was. It's about gay,
heroin addicted angels!

51
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:04,266
Well, Mr. Cynical, you stole it.
And you looked fabulous!

52
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,699
- Didn't he look fabulous, Mia?
- What?

53
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:09,806
He said I looked fabulous.
Didn't I look fabulous?

54
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:14,104
- He's saying he looked fabulous!
- Gorgeous, he looked gorgeous!

55
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,141
Mr. Dangerous!

56
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:20,217
You were brilliant!

57
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:22,318
- You were brilliant!
- What?

58
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,646
Brilliant!

59
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,763
The first time I saw her
she was so gorgeous.

60
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:47,968
My God! Name! And then I said, I want
to fly you in under cover of darkness.

61
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:49,771
I want to chop you up.
I want snort you...

62
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:52,950
and then I'll represent the
fucking hell out of you.

63
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,286
- Oh my God!
- The gay mafia. Don't shoot.

64
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:59,616
- Stick 'em up!
- Put it down. Come here.

65
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:01,121
How are you, pretty?

66
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,953
- How're you doing?
- Okay, how are you?

67
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:05,459
- Hey, Stiev.
- Mia, how're you doing?

68
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:08,491
You look great!

69
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,734
- It's good to see you.
- Stiev, where did you get that suit?

70
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:15,804
I don't know. Some Italian guy.
It's hard for me to find clothes.

71
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,975
I'm circus tall.

72
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,840
You know what I mean?

73
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:22,702
Gray, on the other hand,
take him to Gap Kids one day.

74
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:24,472
He's set for the year.

75
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:31,054
I'm saying, I'm jealous. You got a
great broad. You're easy to dress.

76
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:33,522
Out of the way.

77
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:39,593
- Wow! That's a weird moment.
- I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.

78
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:41,288
Come here.

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,167
Stop it. C'mon. You're terrific.
Off screen he's better, honestly.

80
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,498
- I love you, man.
- I love you.

81
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,402
Call me when I'm in town.

82
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,807
- Charlotte!
- Mia!

83
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:03,110
- Is everybody as fucked up as I am?
- We're all fucked up. Him especially.

84
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:06,913
Could we get a drink
over here, please?

85
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,593
You didn't give her number
to Elvis Costello, did you?

86
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,386
Who?

87
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:15,161
- It's okay.
- What?

88
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,132
Come on, Gray.

89
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:20,248
Oh God!

90
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,696
Oh God!

91
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,574
I miss Sundays.

92
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,804
It is Sunday.

93
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,915
I know.

94
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:47,510
That's a little frightening.

95
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:54,550
These love letters are all
from kids or something.

96
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:57,643
Good morning, sunshine.

97
00:12:57,855 --> 00:12:59,447
Good morning.

98
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,892
Here are your invitations...

99
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:07,588
and your fan mail... cigarettes...
okay, so if you...

100
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,165
- Low fat?
- Yeah.

101
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:17,573
Tomorrow your urologist had to cancel
cause he had to see his chiropractor.

102
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:20,471
You need anything else then?
Fruit?

103
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,574
No? Okay.
Okay. Bye!

104
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:29,617
Gabriel... Camden. I think
he's British. I can't read...

105
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:32,517
- I like British guys.
- Read it.

106
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:36,285
"Dear Mia,
I'm sure you hear this a lot.

107
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:38,758
But you're a very,
very beautiful woman.

108
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:44,593
And I know you have a depth
that few movie stars possess".

109
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:47,862
Oh I feel so much better now.
I need that every morning. Thank you.

110
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,199
"I feel a genuine
connection with you...

111
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,000
and know that if you
were to meet me...

112
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,202
you would know that this is
not just another fan letter."

113
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,937
Really?

114
00:13:57,148 --> 00:14:00,117
Like you've never
heard that one before.

115
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:05,688
"I'm five ten with brown
eyes and a good build and..."

116
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:49,294
"If you're willing to have coffee
or tea, if you would prefer...

117
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,968
then you'd know
I wasn't just a fan...

118
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,832
but someone with whom
you could really relate."

119
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,434
You should call him.

120
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:34,871
- Hello?
- Jett, it's me.

121
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,344
- Cynthia?
- No, it's Gray.

122
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:42,578
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean? It's Sunday.

123
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:47,618
I tried leaving a message.
Your voice mail is full.

124
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:51,852
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry about that. I...
- You suck!

125
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:58,131
Gray, look, I can't go out today, man.
I've got a woman coming over.

126
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,127
- Who?
- You don't know her.

127
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,169
I met her on the train.
She's a waitress.

128
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,772
I like the story, Gray!

129
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:09,736
Are you sure?
The light's so beautiful right now.

130
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:13,110
She's got an ass like a twelve-year-old
boy. I've got to prepare myself.

131
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,314
See you.

132
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,956
That'll be $ 37.24.

133
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:12,398
Look, I'm sure
you hate this, but...

134
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,594
I just wanted to
tell you that your work...

135
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:18,408
it really, it really means a lot to me.
It's had an impact on my life.

136
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:20,304
Thank you.

137
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,776
This probably sounds crazy,
but I actually...

138
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:27,280
I wrote you one of those
letters a couple of weeks ago.

139
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:30,045
- You did?
- Yeah. My name is John Eckart.

140
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:32,552
- Gray.
- It's nice to meet you.

141
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:35,853
You... sign that?

142
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:41,462
You know, I've never done anything
like that before. But I'm a filmmaker.

143
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,533
Well, a grad student right now. But...

144
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:48,227
surely, you are one of the few
guys whose work actually inspires me.

145
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,808
Well, thank you, that means
a lot to me. Thank you.

146
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:55,906
- You were in film school, right?
- What?

147
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,081
You used to be in film school,
right?

148
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:03,783
Yeah, I went to film school,
and then I became an actor.

149
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,786
You know, my girlfriend actually
saw an exhibition of your photography.

150
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,791
She said it was really wonderful stuff.
She really dug it.

151
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,123
Oh she did?

152
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:26,375
- A cranberry muffin, sir.
- Thank you.

153
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:30,339
Gray Evans, I'd like to introduce
you to my girlfriend, Jane Styros.

154
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,980
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

155
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,917
John and Jane, that's...

156
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,686
- Well, I should probably...
- Well, here's your stuff.

157
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:46,954
- Do you need a bag or anything?
- Oh no, I'm fine.

158
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:49,689
Well, stop by any time. I'll give you
a discount on the movies you're in.

159
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:52,434
You'd have to pay
me to buy those.

160
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,635
It was nice meeting you!

161
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:03,003
"I'll give you a discount
on the movies you're in."

162
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:06,047
That was so smooth,
that was good.

163
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:44,812
- Gray!
- What are you wearing?

164
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,125
How about a smile, Gray?

165
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,525
Smile! Smile, Gray!

166
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:44,138
It's all right. It's probably not as
a big a deal as you feel it is cause...

167
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:45,975
you're the one going through it.

168
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:49,311
Everyone goes through
stuff in relationships.

169
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,919
- It's just... it's...
- You know what I mean?

170
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:54,750
Yeah. It's just...

171
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,750
well, to be honest, it's just
really getting ridiculous. We...

172
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:02,932
we hardly ever have sex anymore.

173
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:05,161
We don't make love anymore.

174
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:10,500
Unless we're drunk
or after some... fight.

175
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:15,872
I knew a girl who was the
most beautiful, attractive girl.

176
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:19,274
- A really beautiful, smart, wonderful...
- Which one? Which one?

177
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:21,781
I don't think you knew her.
Her name was Shelby.

178
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:25,817
And she dated this guy, and there was
nothing exceptional about the guy.

179
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:28,321
I mean, she supported him.
He didn't even have a job.

180
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:32,359
He wasn't complimenting her. He
wouldn't tell her he cared about her.

181
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:34,030
He was always telling her,
you're not doing this right...

182
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:35,926
Exactly!

183
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:39,193
Everyone would say:
"You're great, you're beautiful"...

184
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:42,201
He was always like:
"You're not pretty in that".

185
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:44,806
She showed up at my house one time.
While we were talking or whatever...

186
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,636
she had a black eye.

187
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:50,808
I said to her: "Everyone says
you're the most beautiful girl.

188
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:54,917
You're the smartest, you're the
best friend anyone could have.

189
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,180
What the fuck are you doing
with this fucking animal?".

190
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:02,987
And she said to me:

191
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:07,355
"He's the only one
that tells me the truth".

192
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:12,960
And that's when it gets... heavy.

193
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,230
Cause you're usually
so up and wonderful.

194
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,500
- Yeah.
- And you need to carry that with you.

195
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:23,112
I just don't feel like that right now.

196
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:26,977
- Stop it. Don't be that girl.
- You're being very sweet. I'm sorry.

197
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:29,846
- I'm serious.
- No.

198
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:33,785
I'm not being sweet. You've just
been going through a heavy thing.

199
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,959
I don't know.

200
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,426
But you are those things.
You know that.

201
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,467
And... cut!

202
00:23:57,815 --> 00:24:00,579
Could I get a hot towel?
Could I get a hot towel?

203
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,851
I know you were a little concerned
about that scene.

204
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:09,252
But I really think it's
going to play well.

205
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,451
No, it's just CGI.

206
00:24:11,662 --> 00:24:13,596
Fucking asshole.

207
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:18,063
Oh Jesus Christ! Yehud, you scared the
shit out of me. How'd you get in here?

208
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:20,465
Do I ask you how you do your job?

209
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:24,072
But I don't pay you
to sneak up on me.

210
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:27,267
I wouldn't go in there
for awhile if I were you.

211
00:24:27,544 --> 00:24:32,140
Say! That was a pretty nice piece of
chicken you had there in the elevator.

212
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,943
Yeah, if you want to feel like
a midget the rest of your life.

213
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:42,186
- So, how are you doing, Yehud?
- Not bad. Yourself?

214
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:46,992
- I'm a little concerned. I mean...
- Of course you are.

215
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:50,698
- What do you mean? Should I be?
- Relax, Gray.

216
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:53,266
I'm only saying,
people don't usually call me...

217
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,028
unless they are concerned.

218
00:24:57,274 --> 00:25:00,004
- Yeah?
- It's Samantha!

219
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,735
Hi. I just wanted to make sure
that you knew that Yoohude...

220
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:04,573
- Yehud.
- Yehud, sorry.

221
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:06,613
Yeah.
He scared the shit out of me.

222
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:09,745
- Right. Sorry.
- I think he's here.

223
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:11,818
- Are you here, Yehud?
- Yes. I am here.

224
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:13,011
- Yes, he's here.
- Okay!

225
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:15,416
Good. I'm gonna go then.
If you need...

226
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:18,925
Okay, so, your gastroanterologist is...

227
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:24,590
Dialect coach at three o'clock.
Okay, I'm gonna go. I'll be on my cell.

228
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:25,826
- Have a good rest of your day.
- Yeah, you too.

229
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:27,333
- Bye!
- Bye.

230
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:30,665
- Are you fucking her?
- No.

231
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,968
So look, Yehud,
I don't know if it's a big deal or not.

232
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:36,777
Gray, no one is trying to kill you!

233
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,542
Yehud, I've seen the guy twice in two
days. I'm telling you, he's fucked up.

234
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:45,085
- Yeah?
- Five minute warning, Gray!

235
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:48,986
Okay!
So, you know...

236
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:51,821
You want I should hang around
the set a little bit, huh?

237
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:54,725
- Go to a few premieres?
- Yes. Just check him out.

238
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:58,595
All right, all right.
I'll check him out. All right?

239
00:25:58,802 --> 00:25:59,894
Thank you.

240
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:03,733
I have to make a ball game.
Doing security for the playoffs.

241
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,068
- I'll start tomorrow.
- Hey...

242
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:09,302
what do you know
about Elvis Costello?

243
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,248
You think Elvis Costello
is stalking you?

244
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,144
No. No. Never mind.

245
00:26:16,386 --> 00:26:17,648
All right.

246
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:23,857
Oh by the way. That window.
Security risk.

247
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:28,127
Yehud is kidding.

248
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,027
Listen to me!

249
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:36,763
I want you to tell me the instant that
you're ready to start reading again.

250
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:39,340
Because if I start the day
with 500 calls on my sheet...

251
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:42,273
literally 499 of them
are about you. Okay?

252
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:46,540
"When is he reading?
When is he reading?"

253
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,241
I said: "First of all, he's a person.
Second of all, I'm busy.

254
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:52,621
And 3rd. Of all,
I think it's a mistake... as an actor.

255
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,120
He's not some other thing."

256
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,791
But, I'm serious.
I need you to tell me immediately.

257
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:59,520
Because, seriously.
500 calls, 499 about you.

258
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,994
I'm not kidding.
I mean, I'm kidding a little, but...

259
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:05,464
Yeah, okay. Hey, does anybody
want anything from the bathroom?

260
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,674
Hey, do you remember me?

261
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:52,443
My name's John.
You came into my video store.

262
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:55,049
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What a strange coincidence.

263
00:27:55,252 --> 00:28:00,622
Yeah, no kidding. My girl's got us
tickets to this thing. Do you want to...

264
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:02,792
Thank you.

265
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,459
Are you here alone?

266
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,106
Oh no. I brought my girl.
You met her the other day. Jane.

267
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:21,644
Yeah. So, do you wanna...

268
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:26,214
Hey, honey, look who I ran into.

269
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:30,118
- That's funny.
- Yeah. What a coincidence.

270
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,880
- How are you doing?
- Great.

271
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:35,950
- We should...
- You know... sorry.

272
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,820
We went down to the zoo today
and took some photos.

273
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:39,427
Have you ever done that?

274
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,463
- No, I haven't.
- No?

275
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,169
Don't you hate when people
come up and bug you?

276
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:49,433
Is that what you
came up to ask me?

277
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:52,268
Let's just go. He obviously
doesn't want to be bothered.

278
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:57,277
It's probably cool, right?
It means people give a shit, right?

279
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:03,749
When you were dying in that flick
with the angels, what did you say?

280
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:06,689
"Get me the fuck out of here."

281
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,882
- That's what you said?
- I've got to get back to my wife.

282
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:13,961
Mia? I'd get back to her too,
if I were you.

283
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:18,891
The guy's a lot shorter
than I expected.

284
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,461
- It's a great place.
- My God, where's it on?

285
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:26,939
- It's down by Rosarito.
- Rosarito. Have you been there?

286
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:30,545
- It's gorgeous. Right on the beach.
- But what do you do?

287
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:34,911
- You go to the beach, relax...
- Do you like the beach?

288
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:38,747
If he wants me to go to Rosarito,
fine. Have you been there?

289
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:44,894
- You have? No way!
- Gray Evans! I love your work.

290
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:47,893
How about my work?
Hello?

291
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:50,897
Lovely.

292
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,034
This is my friend, Charlotte.

293
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:59,504
- Oh my God, song!
- Nicely cap.

294
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:05,178
It's something you say.

295
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:11,243
The stuff that you did before...
Unbelievable!

296
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,350
Have you seen this crap?

297
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,048
- What?
- Listen to this.

298
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,223
"We don't expect Gray Evans
and Mia Lang's Euro marriage...

299
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:50,587
to be long for this world.
Sources report that their relationship...

300
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:54,457
is as stormy as it is steamy. With both
of them prone to fits of rage...

301
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:57,064
and a history of
tumultuous relationships."

302
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:01,234
Well, it's not very nice.

303
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:05,337
What? It's not very nice? It's fucking
slanderous. Are you kidding me?

304
00:31:08,044 --> 00:31:12,913
What? Okay. Maybe you'll find
this one amusing. Listen to this.

305
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:15,710
"Apparently, Gray Evans is
not a big Elvis Costello fan.

306
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:19,353
After repeated phone calls from the
King to Gray's wife, Mia Lang...

307
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:22,753
sources close to the couple say
Gray flew into a jealous rage.

308
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,519
Is Elvis' aim true? We know
someone doesn't seem to think so."

309
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,157
"Sources close to the couple."

310
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:29,992
Those were personal
conversations that we had.

311
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,430
Who have you been talking to?

312
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:36,000
I didn't tell anybody.
Did you, darling?

313
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:41,474
No!

314
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:44,270
I don't even know why
you read that stuff!

315
00:31:50,086 --> 00:31:52,748
I don't see how you can be
so blasé about all this shit.

316
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:55,652
It's just evil press.

317
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:08,367
How come we never cook anymore?

318
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:13,405
We never cooked.

319
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:25,050
Don't be sad.

320
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:28,889
Are you sad?
Don't be sad.

321
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:32,056
Come here.

322
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:35,254
Stop it. Hey!

323
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:44,566
- Do it again!
- I hate you.

324
00:32:56,086 --> 00:32:58,111
What's that, right there?

325
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:02,649
It's a script about
a talking bunny.

326
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,059
- Don't laugh about my work.
- I'm not laughing about your work.

327
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,672
- I'm laughing with your work.
- Okay, fine.

328
00:33:55,345 --> 00:34:00,180
Mia, hi. It's Elvis Costello.
It was great seeing you.

329
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:03,011
Let's make a dinner plan.
I'm in town.

330
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:11,186
You don't lover her,
you son of a bitch!

331
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:14,457
- You motherfucker!
- She's my wife!

332
00:34:14,664 --> 00:34:17,861
- Why don't you treat her like one?
- You're hurting me!

333
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:21,595
You're running from yourself!

334
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,432
- Jesus Christ!
- You're running from yourself...

335
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,700
you stupid son of a bitch!

336
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:30,144
That was great. Fucking brilliant.
Feel good?

337
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:31,712
Feel good, man?
That was fucking excellent.

338
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:35,813
- Method asswipe.
- You never fucking stop the scene.

339
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,978
- I fucking cut the scenes, capisci?
- He almost broke my fucking arm!

340
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,284
- What are you, a fucking idiot?
- Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot.

341
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:44,824
I'm gonna fire your ass.
I don't give a shit who your father is.

342
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,325
- Who cares?
- Fuck off.

343
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:48,224
Who wants to work with you anyway?

344
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:50,592
- Was that good? Yeah?
- I don't feel good. I need another one.

345
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,166
Come on.
Are you kidding me?

346
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:55,998
Scumbag!

347
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,736
Print that one!

348
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,178
- Hello?
- Hey, Gray. It's Felicia.

349
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:38,540
- Hi, Felicia.
- I'm good, thanks.

350
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:40,807
So you sound like you have a
little cold. Are you okay there?

351
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:45,852
No, yeah. I just ate a chili.
Some Thai food.

352
00:35:46,923 --> 00:35:49,221
I know what you're gonna say
but Swoosh, the nightclub...

353
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:52,395
is starting a magazine and they're
doing a happy couples issue...

354
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:55,462
and they want to photograph
hip couples in casual settings.

355
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:59,101
Like at home or playing tennis. And
they want you and Mia for the cover!

356
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:01,930
- We'll do it.
- Wow, that was easy.

357
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,640
No way, Gray. That's too tacky.
I can't do that.

358
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:09,077
No, it's not tacky.
We can do whatever we want.

359
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,871
They're just gonna follow us around.

360
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,412
And we can do whatever
we want to do.

361
00:36:12,615 --> 00:36:15,277
No, I'm sorry. I can't be part of it.

362
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:19,512
I don't understand you. You hate
the business. You hate the rags.

363
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:21,657
You hate that we're
a celebrity couple.

364
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:25,294
No. We are what we are. We might
as well show them what we are.

365
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:28,487
Instead of all this stormy, tempestuous
bullshit that they hear about.

366
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:31,792
- But we are stormy and tempestuous.
- No, we're not!

367
00:36:45,515 --> 00:36:48,712
It's me, Jett.
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.

368
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:54,185
Anyway, I've got to have a
colonoscopy in a couple of weeks...

369
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,488
And I met this little redhead
who said she met you.

370
00:36:57,694 --> 00:36:59,184
She's doing a piece in the same show.

371
00:36:59,395 --> 00:37:02,193
Her name's Jenny or Jane
or something.

372
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:06,300
Don't bother calling back.
I'll be soaking. I'm feeling achey.

373
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:13,874
Of all the people I've interviewed
nobody's done anything so outdoorsy.

374
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:17,672
It's really cute.
Is the zoo kind of like a thing?

375
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:20,406
- No, not really. No.
- Well...

376
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:26,522
we both really love wildlife.
And we like taking walks together.

377
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:29,487
So, it's like killing two
birds with one stone.

378
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:33,458
- Yeah. We don't love birds.
- Hi, how you doing? Hi.

379
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:39,293
- This is so organic, Gray.
- Yeah. I knew you'd love it.

380
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,361
Get a... we're just gonna
get a shot of you guys.

381
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:44,870
- Okie-dokie.
- Smile!

382
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:59,349
So, honey, what do
you want to see first?

383
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:05,091
- A marriage counselor.
- That's not an animal.

384
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:07,493
First of all, I just want to
thank you guys for doing this.

385
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:10,791
I really appreciate it.
And you just both look phenomenal.

386
00:38:13,903 --> 00:38:17,566
Jeez! Do you want water?
Do you need water?

387
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:19,036
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

388
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:20,470
- Yeah.
- Okay.

389
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:26,114
So, average day, what do you
guys do? Day off. A Sunday.

390
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:29,810
Go ahead.

391
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:35,423
Well, we... we get up around
four in the afternoon...

392
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:39,025
order pizza... fix around...

393
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:41,493
what do you say, honey?
Around five, five-thirty-ish.

394
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:45,766
- Fix?
- Yeah. Shoot up heroin.

395
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,341
- We're kidding. We're kidding.
- Right.

396
00:38:53,543 --> 00:38:57,673
You know, it's pretty normal.
It's just like anybody else.

397
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:02,181
Just wake up, have breakfast...

398
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,819
you know...

399
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,590
read the paper, you know?

400
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,957
Just read the paper.

401
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:20,192
You gave me fake tits, man.

402
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:24,070
- What?
- We agreed to be on good behavior.

403
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:25,502
They don't get your sense of humor.

404
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:29,405
Excuse me! It's not my fault
they're fucking bimbos!

405
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:32,979
Oh hey! Don't sshh me.
Don't sshh me, okay?

406
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:35,173
I am just being myself.
Isn't that the fucking point?

407
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:40,550
- Be quiet, godammit!
- But, why? This is who we really are!

408
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:44,884
Holy...

409
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:34,370
Hello, Mr. Evans.

410
00:40:52,628 --> 00:40:54,289
- Are you all right, sir?
- What are you doing?

411
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:55,657
You have the right
to remain silent.

412
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:59,665
- He's got a gun!
- You have the right to an attorney.

413
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:03,466
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What does it look like?

414
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:05,573
- Making news.
- What?

415
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:18,616
Has Gray Evans gone bonkers?

416
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,379
Or is this just another
example of a fan...

417
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,684
taking his admiration of
his favorite star too far?

418
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:27,590
Some speculate that Larry Hortense
might very well be responsible...

419
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:29,856
for several celebrity stalkings.

420
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:32,159
Others question
whether the star...

421
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:36,065
was just pulling all that kung fu
training for his upcoming film...

422
00:41:36,272 --> 00:41:38,536
abusing on an innocent fan.

423
00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:41,301
Sources close to the
couple say Gray and Mia...

424
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:44,537
are spending a quiet
evening at home together.

425
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:55,185
Gray? What were you thinking?

426
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:00,628
I was just thinking it would
be nice not to get shot.

427
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:07,026
Shot? By whom? All the guy wanted
you to do was sign a copy of his book.

428
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,966
It was "Catcher in the fucking Rye",
Louis.

429
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,675
- So creepy.
- Are you serious?

430
00:42:19,415 --> 00:42:23,681
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?

431
00:42:27,824 --> 00:42:29,849
Oh look.
It's the Wild Bunch.

432
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,029
- Have you issued a statement yet?
- No, I wanted to talk to you guys first.

433
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,925
Right. Good.
We're going to keep it simple.

434
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,791
Obviously I'm just an
entertainment attorney.

435
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,400
So until we find Gray
a criminal attorney...

436
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:42,400
I think it's best that we just say
it was an act of self-defense.

437
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:44,095
It was an act of self-defense.

438
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:47,674
Really? An act of self-defense?
Did he threaten you, Gray?

439
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,777
I've seen the guy 90 fucking times!

440
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,746
Yehud, can you please tell them that
the last thing a stalker is gonna do...

441
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:58,182
before he shoots you in the
head is explain it to you first.

442
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:03,185
It's true. You know, there does seem
to be a stalking epidemic going on.

443
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:06,259
That's fine, but this guy
is not a stalker. He's a fan.

444
00:43:06,863 --> 00:43:08,660
Yeah. And Mark Chapman
just loved the "White Album".

445
00:43:08,865 --> 00:43:09,854
Well, it was a good album.

446
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,134
Look, this guy is pressing charges,
okay? This is serious.

447
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,770
This is absurd.
Get me another drink, please.

448
00:43:16,072 --> 00:43:17,505
What do you want, Scotch?

449
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:20,232
- How are you doing?
- I'm sorry?

450
00:43:20,443 --> 00:43:22,536
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thanks.

451
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:24,872
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- I'm sorry?

452
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:29,914
All right, so we'll regroup tomorrow?
Gray, just get some rest.

453
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:32,314
- Yehud, can I talk to you for a moment?
- Yeah.

454
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,286
- Vicodin?
- Yeah.

455
00:43:40,997 --> 00:43:46,799
Remember, you have a
breakfast at ten-thirty!

456
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,299
There's something else that
I wanted to talk to you about.

457
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:52,030
And I know that you'll probably
think I'm pretty paranoid here.

458
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:58,476
But, really, at this point...

459
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:01,013
I'm at my wit's end and...

460
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:04,084
- What is the problem?
- Well, okay.

461
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,321
Last week I got a fan
letter from this guy.

462
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:17,062
- Hortense?
- No, no, no. It's a different guy.

463
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:18,255
A different guy.

464
00:44:18,868 --> 00:44:21,029
I coincidentally meet
him the same day.

465
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:22,966
Nice to meet you.

466
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,161
Okay?

467
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:28,034
Two days later...

468
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:32,844
I again, coincidentally,
run into him and his girlfriend.

469
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:39,545
Who, apparently, is a fan of
my photography. Whatever.

470
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:44,019
Then, three days ago, I get a
message from my friend, Jett.

471
00:44:44,227 --> 00:44:46,923
I tried leaving you a message.
Your voicemail's full.

472
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:51,361
Some girl is doing an art
installation with my friend.

473
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,535
I'm feeling achey.

474
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:57,432
Right?

475
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,067
Right.

476
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:07,409
I'm going to suggest...

477
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:10,415
putting a couple of guys on you.

478
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,147
- No, no, no...
- Nothing much.

479
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:17,554
Yehud, no. I'm not a freak.
I don't want...

480
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,490
You are a freak.
You're a movie star.

481
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:24,393
- I just want you to check them out.
- All right.

482
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:26,496
- What about a gun?
- What?

483
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:29,466
- That will make you feel better.
- No!

484
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:32,004
Do I look like Charlton Heston?
No, no gun!

485
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,335
All right, all right.
But, if you change your mind...

486
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:36,738
No, I'm not going to change
my mind. Just look into it.

487
00:45:36,946 --> 00:45:39,642
All right, all right. You don't have
to get snappy with me, huh?

488
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:41,373
No, I'm not getting... Yehud.

489
00:46:50,386 --> 00:46:52,980
I'm so sorry, Shana baby.
I wanted to do laundry with you.

490
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:55,089
That's all right, little man.
How did you do?

491
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,316
Well, it was good,
but I know I shouldn't get too riled.

492
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,858
You're cute when you're riled.
How about some food?

493
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:01,393
See that's why I'm really excited.

494
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:04,065
I bought these
2 big heads of ice berg.

495
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:06,166
Does someone want his favorite salad?

496
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:10,328
- Somebody maybe might.
- Because my baby needs to lose a few.

497
00:47:12,475 --> 00:47:15,410
- I missed you all day.
- I missed you more.

498
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:17,579
Let's never spend more
than 4 h apart.

499
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,247
I say okay.

500
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:28,349
Did you get some good stuff today?
The sky was so crazy blue.

501
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,388
Hey, good lookin',
let me get a shot of you.

502
00:47:35,498 --> 00:47:36,863
Perfect.

503
00:48:19,742 --> 00:48:21,869
Felicia gave me these
headshots for you to autograph...

504
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,443
for tap shoes for Toddlers.

505
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:26,706
Okay. I know. I'm sorry.
I'll hang onto them.

506
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:31,546
Also, she wanted me to show you this.
It's "The National...

507
00:48:37,092 --> 00:48:38,957
Have you seen this bullshit?

508
00:48:40,663 --> 00:48:42,290
They're probably going to use
the National Probe as evidence.

509
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:46,293
- Gray...
- Can you fucking believe this shit?

510
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:50,768
Don't worry about Hortense.
He doesn't have a case.

511
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:52,998
Yeah, okay.

512
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:59,611
Tell me. Are you really
afraid of these kids?

513
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,910
I don't know. You tell me.
Is this all them?

514
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:08,250
- I'm the best bargain in town.
- Yeah, right.

515
00:49:10,226 --> 00:49:11,215
So...

516
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:15,254
what do we have here?

517
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:22,731
John Eckart and Jane Styros.

518
00:49:23,939 --> 00:49:26,407
They live near the video store
where you first met them.

519
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:32,411
But, Gray, I'm telling you,
there's nothing to worry about here.

520
00:49:35,751 --> 00:49:39,414
- Are they in love?
- Made my stomach turn.

521
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:44,059
Do you want to see a picture of the
girl naked? She's a natural redhead.

522
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,784
No, thank you.

523
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:49,260
No fire in the hole, huh?

524
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:53,599
So, what's a normal day for them?
What do they do?

525
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:57,327
- Just couple stuff, mostly.
- Yeah? What stuff?

526
00:49:57,773 --> 00:50:01,869
- Just what normal couples do.
- Well, what do normal couples do?

527
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:05,173
For instance, what did they do
last night? Just for an example.

528
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:08,509
Last night?
Last night?

529
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:14,246
Last night, John finished
work a little later than usual.

530
00:50:14,456 --> 00:50:19,758
He picked out some DVD's.
Some French shit, I think.

531
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:24,862
He went to the hardware store,
picked up a new shower curtain.

532
00:50:25,134 --> 00:50:30,231
Then he went grocery shopping.
He got home around 7.

533
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:32,504
It's a small joint.

534
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:37,302
Studio apartment.
Lots of knick-knacks.

535
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:41,813
Art pieces on the walls.
It's kind of a beatnik deal.

536
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:44,952
Anyway, then
he heads into the kitchen...

537
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:46,985
and it looks like
he sneaked up on her.

538
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:55,797
It was as though they had not seen
each other for days. Or weeks.

539
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:59,832
But, in fact it was 9 hours
and 20 minutes.

540
00:51:00,636 --> 00:51:04,003
Then he made her dinner.

541
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:08,133
What did he make?

542
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:14,340
Sea bass with a Teriyaki glaze.
Brown rice and asparagus.

543
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:20,187
Did she like it?

544
00:51:20,923 --> 00:51:23,892
What is all this shit?
What are all these papers?

545
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:28,894
This? This is a transcript. Shotgun
mike from outside their window.

546
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:35,362
- You don't fuck around, Yehud.
- That's just what 5 grand buys you.

547
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:39,405
For ten, I can pose as
Jane's gynecologist.

548
00:51:39,608 --> 00:51:46,036
No, I'm cool. Thank you.
Look, they seem really harmless...

549
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,240
and things have been
really strange lately.

550
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:54,650
- But can I hold onto that?
- It's your copy.

551
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:59,521
- Oh good. Thank you.
- All right. I'll see you around.

552
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,422
Yeah.

553
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,524
Gray.

554
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:13,540
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Oh I know. Yeah.

555
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,170
- I'll be at Swoosh if you need me.
- Okay.

556
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:42,370
You're right. I think most of
them make those smaller films...

557
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:47,167
calling cards so they can then
make bigger studio films, you know?

558
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:51,107
I don't think they're doing
it for the love of it.

559
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:53,406
I know, Mia.
Yeah, you're right.

560
00:52:53,615 --> 00:52:56,277
In the '70's, kids did it because
they had to do it. It's like...

561
00:52:56,485 --> 00:52:59,318
with music, where kids don't
even bother to learn to play.

562
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:02,012
Now, movie cameras
are the new guitars.

563
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:05,523
- Directors are the new rock stars.
- Right, right. Yeah.

564
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:09,095
Here's your check, folks. I just
want to say, have a great night.

565
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:11,323
- You too.
- Thank you.

566
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:16,402
I'm sorry, I just have to tell you guys,
I really love both your work.

567
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:55,638
Hello, darling.

568
00:54:00,682 --> 00:54:03,082
What's all this?

569
00:54:03,485 --> 00:54:07,353
Well, we're always going out or
eating take out and I figured...

570
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:11,117
it would be nice to have a nice
homemade dinner at home.

571
00:54:13,362 --> 00:54:16,422
- You made all this?
- Can you fucking believe it?

572
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,428
- Wow. Okay.
- Have a seat.

573
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,568
How was your day?

574
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:34,943
Well, it was good.
I ran some errands...

575
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,584
and I made dinner.

576
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,545
And, you know...

577
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:49,725
- How was your day?
- Fine.

578
00:54:49,932 --> 00:54:55,063
- Yeah? Work was good?
- You know. Same old thing.

579
00:54:56,505 --> 00:55:01,807
Yeah, I hear you. First-time
filmmakers can be a doozy.

580
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,309
You never know
why they're doing it.

581
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:09,109
I always thought that...

582
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:13,345
that those guys...
they're making films...

583
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:16,652
so that they can make
big studio ones.

584
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:19,885
They're not doing it for
the love of doing it.

585
00:55:20,762 --> 00:55:22,855
So what's for dinner?

586
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:33,867
We have a nice sea
bass with Teriyaki glaze.

587
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:36,942
Brown rice.

588
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:42,574
And then we have something
that will make your pee stink.

589
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:46,050
I'm allergic to sea bass.
Remember?

590
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:50,647
I almost died that time.
Ring a bell?

591
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:03,961
- Does that ring your bell?
- No.

592
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,178
Wow. You don't remember
making that phone call.

593
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:13,410
I can play the message for you.

594
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:17,514
It was about a job, Gray.
He wants to make a musical with me.

595
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:24,420
Well I think that's the biggest crock
of bullshit I've ever heard in my life.

596
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:26,821
Really? What, exactly?

597
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:29,553
He just wants to do
a musical with you?

598
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:31,665
I was gonna tell you, but I don't
know if you've noticed...

599
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:33,858
you've been a little tense lately.

600
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,932
You're just drunk.

601
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:46,445
Why don't you just go, get sober, come
back and we eat and we talk about it.

602
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,850
Yeah, let's eat the sea bass.
Maybe you can choke to death.

603
00:56:53,588 --> 00:56:57,354
You don't talk to me like that.
What did I do wrong?

604
00:57:26,221 --> 00:57:28,212
- Hi.
- Hi.

605
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,883
Watching static?

606
00:57:32,094 --> 00:57:35,655
I was gonna watch a movie.
Do you want to watch a movie?

607
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:41,229
I had a dream.

608
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:48,070
Was it a lucid dream?

609
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:51,174
Yeah. I think I knew
I was dreaming.

610
00:57:52,047 --> 00:57:58,213
And that's what you chose to do?
I fly if I know I'm dreaming.

611
00:57:59,254 --> 00:58:01,882
Yeah, I'm afraid of heights.

612
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:06,225
So now this is what
you're choosing to do?

613
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:11,195
Dreaming about dreaming about
watching us on television?

614
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:16,301
Yeah, because I love us.

615
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:20,136
I love us too.

616
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:30,409
He just wants an autographed headshot
and he'll forget the whole thing.

617
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,143
Now he's just
gonna drop the charges?

618
00:58:32,354 --> 00:58:33,844
Yeah.

619
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,148
- You gonna send him one?
- I don't know.

620
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:37,757
I think I want
to go to trial on this baby.

621
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,061
Hey, I've got to get home, so...

622
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:45,822
Yeah. All right, I'll see you.

623
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:22,429
- Hi, John.
- Hey, Gray. How you doing?

624
00:59:22,704 --> 00:59:25,901
It's good to see you again.
Hey, are you all right?

625
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:29,043
I heard about the thing...
whatever it was.

626
00:59:29,244 --> 00:59:32,509
- What thing?
- I don't know, the incident...

627
00:59:33,014 --> 00:59:37,576
- No, everything's fine.
- Just wanted to ask.

628
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:41,715
Wow. I can't believe it.

629
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,194
- You did it anyway.
- I'm sorry, sweetie, I couldn't help it.

630
00:59:49,397 --> 00:59:53,197
- Wow, Jane. You look great.
- Did you hear that?

631
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:54,800
You love it.

632
00:59:56,238 --> 00:59:59,366
What happened to you
guys the other night?

633
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:03,135
You kind of seemed like you were
being crushed by the masses in there...

634
01:00:03,345 --> 01:00:04,209
and she didn't feel so well...

635
01:00:04,412 --> 01:00:06,676
I get anxiety attacks
at things like that.

636
01:00:06,882 --> 01:00:10,784
I have to take a horse tranquilizer
every time I go to one of those things.

637
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:13,477
Do you want anything? Cause I'm
just about to close out my drawer.

638
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:15,053
I'll give you the
employee discount.

639
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:19,591
Oh yeah. Can I look around
for a second? Okay, thanks.

640
01:00:20,328 --> 01:00:22,421
- So...
- So?

641
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,860
- You hate it.
- No, it's not that I hate it.

642
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:29,127
- I'm just surprised.
- Lie to me. Just pretend you like it.

643
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:32,033
Okay, I'll lie, then. I love it.
I think it's great.

644
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,673
That's better.

645
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,025
You're gonna leave me for
her someday, aren't you?

646
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:07,871
No, I'm not. Come on, I'd never
be able to get her phone number.

647
01:01:08,076 --> 01:01:09,976
Jerk!

648
01:01:16,651 --> 01:01:18,642
You're my baby, baby.

649
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:22,482
- I love you.
- I love you.

650
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:33,292
Do we have to rent a movie today?
Can't we go out?

651
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:36,061
- Well, let's go out and see a movie.
- No. You know what I mean.

652
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:38,666
"Singing in the Rain" is playing.

653
01:01:38,873 --> 01:01:41,467
Come on, please. It's movie day.
Please, please, please.

654
01:01:41,676 --> 01:01:45,134
No. Yesterday was movie day.
Today is living day.

655
01:01:48,016 --> 01:01:51,179
Who could resist such a
blatant act of manipulation?

656
01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:00,084
Did you find anything
you want back there?

657
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:09,232
Hey, do you guys want to
go get a drink? Or five?

658
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:15,235
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay.

659
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:23,879
Good night, Mr. Gray.

660
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:45,363
- Where have you been?
- Oh just kicking it by Jett's.

661
01:02:46,775 --> 01:02:50,768
Kicking it by Jett's or
kicking it with Jett?

662
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:55,211
Aren't we just a bunch
poking in the swill?

663
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,524
- Why are you so happy?
- Can't I be happy?

664
01:03:06,928 --> 01:03:10,455
I don't know. Can you?

665
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:13,427
Somebody had a bad day.

666
01:03:13,635 --> 01:03:18,163
Somebody lost some job
to some 19-year-old model.

667
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:23,141
I should just start sticking my finger
down my throat like the rest of them.

668
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,314
Oh God, that movie was
horseshit anyway, sweetie.

669
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:27,913
What?

670
01:03:29,984 --> 01:03:33,476
You're being all supportive, Gray.
Is it Christmas?

671
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:35,346
Sure.

672
01:03:37,092 --> 01:03:41,290
Now, you are in a good mood.

673
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:50,267
Maybe you're in a good mood
because I'm in a bad mood.

674
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:56,942
Sweetie, you're so beautiful.

675
01:03:58,146 --> 01:03:59,135
- No.
- Yes.

676
01:03:59,347 --> 01:04:01,747
- No.
- Yes.

677
01:04:05,854 --> 01:04:09,346
I'm your fat old wife.

678
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:39,720
Gray

679
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:15,781
I want to dye my hair brown.
What do you think?

680
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:19,289
No color. Just cut it.

681
01:05:27,502 --> 01:05:32,132
- I love this. So beautiful.
- You look beautiful.

682
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:36,101
Hey, you almost done?
Come to bed.

683
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:39,144
No, I haven't even started yet.

684
01:05:40,715 --> 01:05:44,947
I don't know how much
longer I can do this. Honestly.

685
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:47,917
This thing is due on Thursday.
I don't have a single idea for it.

686
01:05:48,122 --> 01:05:49,783
I have to work all day tomorrow.

687
01:05:54,295 --> 01:05:57,162
Maybe I just don't have
anything left to say.

688
01:05:57,365 --> 01:05:59,333
Of course you do.

689
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,868
What?

690
01:06:06,841 --> 01:06:10,436
Honey, you're just tired.

691
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:20,248
It was crazy seeing Gray the other
night with all those fans, huh?

692
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:23,420
It's disturbing.

693
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:30,992
- Yeah, I know, but come on. I mean...
- What?

694
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:33,064
- It would be nice to...
- To what?

695
01:06:33,268 --> 01:06:36,965
To have a bunch of frat-brat
date rapists mob you every day?

696
01:06:37,171 --> 01:06:40,197
Hey, some of my best
friends are date rapists.

697
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:45,304
No, I'm not talking about
the fame and all that, but...

698
01:06:47,982 --> 01:06:52,885
this is bullshit. Working for
minimum wage? It sucks.

699
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:57,990
Working all day surrounded by
movies other people made? It sucks.

700
01:06:58,192 --> 01:07:02,891
I can barely even afford this place.
The pipes are rusted.

701
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:08,467
Hey. But yours isn't.
That's all I care about.

702
01:07:13,207 --> 01:07:17,701
Just give it time, baby.
I mean, we're hardly old folks.

703
01:07:17,912 --> 01:07:20,676
We're as old as we've ever been.

704
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:30,250
Before I met you, all I thought
about was work and success.

705
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:38,658
But now I swear none of that
would mean shit without you.

706
01:07:40,034 --> 01:07:42,093
I love you so much.

707
01:07:53,481 --> 01:07:56,575
I love you so much.

708
01:08:16,437 --> 01:08:19,634
Welcome back to Katie's Korner.
This show is dedicated...

709
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:23,877
to people with narcissistic
personality disorders.

710
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:25,602
We're very fortunate
to have with us...

711
01:08:25,813 --> 01:08:30,273
a very, very kind decent
human being, Steve Johnson...

712
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:35,115
who happens to have the disorder.
Now Dr. Cheryl Fein here...

713
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:36,381
may have faith...

714
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:39,958
that something special's gonna
happen today in this half hour.

715
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:43,460
If you are not a religious person...

716
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:47,328
if you don't believe in God,
love can take its place.

717
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,967
But that, too,
can become a compulsion.

718
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:53,436
And you lose faith in that,
what have you got? Yourself.

719
01:08:53,641 --> 01:08:57,133
But the key is to
cultivate yourself.

720
01:08:57,979 --> 01:09:03,713
Have a strong sense of yourself,
but without being self-absorbed.

721
01:09:03,918 --> 01:09:09,720
Only then can your relationships
be healthy. Not objects of worship.

722
01:09:09,924 --> 01:09:12,552
I think it might really help
you to get out of your head.

723
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,352
To start listening to people.

724
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:17,531
Really, really listening.

725
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:22,830
I can see already you have a tendency
to get distracted and cut people off.

726
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,470
Are you a religious person?

727
01:09:24,906 --> 01:09:27,841
Not only will listening help
you get out of your head...

728
01:09:28,176 --> 01:09:31,145
but you might really learn
something about humanity.

729
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:33,870
Which is much bigger
than you or me.

730
01:10:11,385 --> 01:10:15,446
Hey, did you see this? It says Gray
Evans and Mia Lang might split up.

731
01:10:15,656 --> 01:10:18,386
That guy is an idiot if
he breaks up with her.

732
01:10:18,826 --> 01:10:22,762
- Shit, I'll rock that.
- Dude, she's like 30.

733
01:10:47,688 --> 01:10:50,020
You're gonna leave
me for her someday.

734
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:54,359
Oh, come on, I'd never be
able to get her phone number.

735
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:15,146
You fucked around on me.
You were drunk.

736
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:19,543
You cry, you apologize.
You'd do it again.

737
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:23,116
Now how can you expect
me to put up with that?

738
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:28,455
- Because we love each other.
- We used to love each other.

739
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:31,160
When you used to say things like:

740
01:11:31,465 --> 01:11:36,493
"Shana, before I met you, all I
thought about was work and success.

741
01:11:36,704 --> 01:11:38,638
But none of that means
shit without you".

742
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:45,609
I'm trying to watch.

743
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:04,857
Cathy, I can't wait until this picture
is finished. No more secrecy.

744
01:12:05,066 --> 01:12:07,762
I'm gonna let Lena know.
I'm gonna let everyone know.

745
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:10,563
Your fans will be bitterly
disappointed.

746
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:14,070
From now on, there's only
one fan I'm worried about.

747
01:12:17,912 --> 01:12:18,674
There!

748
01:12:19,113 --> 01:12:24,050
- What did I tell you, Lena?
- Thanks, you're a real friend!

749
01:12:27,989 --> 01:12:33,586
- Have you seen this movie?
- Parts of it, I think. Thank you.

750
01:12:33,794 --> 01:12:36,820
- You were kissed him!
- I was kissing her!

751
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:39,727
- I happen to be in love with her.
- That's ridiculous.

752
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:42,994
Everybody knows
you're in love with me!

753
01:12:45,706 --> 01:12:47,571
I'm gonna go get a sandwich.
Do you want anything?

754
01:12:47,775 --> 01:12:50,107
- I'll get it. What do you want?
- No, I'll get it. Do you want anything?

755
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:54,077
- No. Thanks for asking.
- I'm going to marry her.

756
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:57,080
Silly boy.
She ain't the marrying type.

757
01:12:57,285 --> 01:13:00,083
She's just trying to get
ahead by using you.

758
01:13:00,288 --> 01:13:04,452
I'll put a stop to that. I'm gonna
go up and say it right now!

759
01:13:04,659 --> 01:13:06,627
But the picture's already finished.

760
01:13:06,827 --> 01:13:08,988
If this girl weren't in the film,
you'll be finished too!

761
01:13:09,363 --> 01:13:11,331
It looks like Gray Evans
may finally be settling...

762
01:13:11,532 --> 01:13:14,262
with his may-or-may-not
be stalker, Larry Hortense.

763
01:13:14,468 --> 01:13:17,335
Evans clobbered the fan
recently at the zoo...

764
01:13:17,538 --> 01:13:20,735
when Evans mistook a copy
of "Catcher in the Rye" for a gun.

765
01:13:21,475 --> 01:13:25,377
Evans initially refused to settle, but
now the autograph is in the mail...

766
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:29,879
says the lawyer, and Hortense
has dropped the charges.

767
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:28,407
As you might recall, the heated
exchange Gray had with...

768
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:32,670
wife Mia Lang, which ended when
Mia stormed off, flashing 2 magazine...

769
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:37,982
Oh, man.

770
01:14:40,921 --> 01:14:43,082
I just wanted to be friends.

771
01:14:49,063 --> 01:14:50,997
We can be friends.

772
01:14:51,465 --> 01:14:55,196
Bull. Now that's bull.
You're just pretending.

773
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:57,803
That's what you do
for a living, isn't it?

774
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:05,278
- You've done this.
- Lf you shoot me, you've done this.

775
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:12,410
I'm not gonna shoot you. Why
would I shoot you? I love you.

776
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,258
What do you want?

777
01:15:22,463 --> 01:15:25,796
We're going to lunch now, okay?
You and I.

778
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,596
We'll hash it out, as they say.
Okay? Pals.

779
01:15:32,206 --> 01:15:34,572
Go fuck yourself!

780
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,511
There's too many of us.

781
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:17,443
Hortense could not be reached
for comment today...

782
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:21,280
as he's currently on a round-the-world
cruise with his mother.

783
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:24,925
In the studio we have an expert
on celebrity stalking...

784
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:46,371
You know, I really think
we can help each other.

785
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:51,540
There are bound to be casualties
borne out of this bullshit scene...

786
01:16:51,752 --> 01:16:54,516
that's swept me up...

787
01:16:54,722 --> 01:16:58,021
and I don't want to
be the next victim.

788
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:03,154
And I feel like you come
from a pure place...

789
01:17:03,364 --> 01:17:07,596
and I just want to be a part of
something that's meaningful.

790
01:17:07,801 --> 01:17:12,238
I think we should write
something together...

791
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:15,636
or we should work
on something together.

792
01:17:17,178 --> 01:17:21,137
- Are you serious?
- Oh, shit. Wait.

793
01:17:23,884 --> 01:17:26,944
Hello? Yeah.

794
01:17:27,821 --> 01:17:31,086
Yeah, I'm having a fucking drink.

795
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:40,699
Look, Gray, you know
that I love what you do.

796
01:17:40,901 --> 01:17:44,200
So are you serious about this?

797
01:17:44,772 --> 01:17:48,936
I'm dead fucking serious.
This is about grass roots.

798
01:17:49,143 --> 01:17:51,168
This is about fucking
the system with the system.

799
01:17:51,378 --> 01:17:53,039
Do you know what I'm saying?

800
01:17:53,247 --> 01:17:55,841
This is about telling our story.

801
01:17:57,518 --> 01:18:01,477
Yes. Yeah. Cheers.

802
01:20:02,076 --> 01:20:06,206
- Can you hand me that pen?
- Are you talking to me?

803
01:20:07,081 --> 01:20:12,075
- You're the only one here.
- I know, how can you stand it?

804
01:20:13,287 --> 01:20:15,653
What the hell has gotten in to you?

805
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:18,757
I don't know. I don't enjoy spending
all my time with another couple.

806
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,554
What?

807
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:23,525
Isn't that what you and
Gray are? A couple?

808
01:20:24,798 --> 01:20:28,199
That's funny. I was about
to ask you the same thing.

809
01:20:28,402 --> 01:20:32,236
I'm not having sex
with your boyfriend.

810
01:20:36,243 --> 01:20:41,738
I don't like this...
I'm tired!

811
01:20:46,053 --> 01:20:49,648
Are you apologizing
without apologizing?

812
01:20:54,862 --> 01:20:57,023
Gray!
Over here!

813
01:21:31,131 --> 01:21:32,530
You all set?

814
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:36,567
Yeah. I have to be at the gallery
at 9 to start setting up.

815
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:44,575
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah. I love you too.

816
01:22:09,369 --> 01:22:12,634
I think the one fucking place someone
could get a little peace and quiet...

817
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,705
would be half way up someone's ass.

818
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:16,876
We gonna film that too.

819
01:22:17,077 --> 01:22:19,204
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

820
01:22:19,713 --> 01:22:24,707
Of course it's not much...

821
01:22:48,942 --> 01:22:50,933
This is Jane.
Please leave a message.

822
01:22:53,981 --> 01:22:58,611
Jane? Are you screening?
It's Nick. I'm not wearing any pants.

823
01:23:00,554 --> 01:23:04,320
Hi... are you there?

824
01:23:04,525 --> 01:23:06,823
After spending the last 24 hours
beating myself up...

825
01:23:07,027 --> 01:23:08,392
I don't know how you...

826
01:23:08,595 --> 01:23:10,426
you have to take some
fucking responsibility, okay?

827
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,297
It's pretty interesting that you'd be so
offended by the word "pathological".

828
01:23:16,503 --> 01:23:20,769
Usually people don't get offended by
things that don't have some relevance.

829
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:24,776
Okay, yeah.
Fucking machine!

830
01:23:27,714 --> 01:23:32,242
Hi, Gray. It's Shana.
I was thinking about what you said...

831
01:23:32,452 --> 01:23:36,821
about how people just grow
out of people sometimes.

832
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:38,958
That didn't make me feel so good.

833
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:45,098
But I wanted you to know that
I really hope you do grow.

834
01:23:45,299 --> 01:23:48,735
Even if it's without me.
And maybe you're right.

835
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:53,734
Maybe with some time apart,
we can both grow.

836
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:58,009
Well, if you ever get tired
of out with your idols...

837
01:23:59,313 --> 01:24:03,306
Hey, Briannon.
This is Ellen calling.

838
01:24:03,517 --> 01:24:07,510
I don't know, I don't usually return
phone calls from strangers, but...

839
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:08,983
So what do you think?

840
01:24:15,262 --> 01:24:18,197
Well, remind me to never
call you pathological.

841
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:24,728
No, I like it, it's good.
It's upsetting, but I like upsetting.

842
01:24:25,606 --> 01:24:27,369
Why upsetting?

843
01:24:27,574 --> 01:24:31,032
I don't know. I just feel like
there's so much misery in...

844
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:37,249
The lives on my estranged lovers.

845
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:40,249
Yeah. I guess.

846
01:24:41,855 --> 01:24:47,919
- What does John think about all this?
- John is very supportive.

847
01:24:51,331 --> 01:24:57,292
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
- No. No, it's a good thing.

848
01:25:02,242 --> 01:25:04,039
Did you ever see that "Twilight Zone"
episode where the guy has...

849
01:25:04,244 --> 01:25:07,008
has a stopwatch
and he can stop time?

850
01:25:07,581 --> 01:25:10,709
Yeah, the one where he freezes
everybody and robs banks?

851
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:14,216
- Yeah.
- What made you think of that?

852
01:25:14,454 --> 01:25:16,979
Well, I'm a little tipsy,
for one thing.

853
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:23,026
Your piece sort of reminds me of that.
Like it sort of freezes everything.

854
01:25:24,698 --> 01:25:28,930
And it's kind of like movies.

855
01:25:29,136 --> 01:25:32,537
You can always go back to a film,
you know, because it never changes.

856
01:25:34,808 --> 01:25:39,006
But you remember what happened
to that guy in "The Twilight Zone"?

857
01:25:39,212 --> 01:25:42,648
He froze everything,
and then his stopwatch broke.

858
01:25:57,397 --> 01:25:58,557
Did you ever see that
"Twilight Zone" episode...

859
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:02,428
where the guy has a stopwatch
and he can stop time?

860
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:05,730
Yeah, the one where he freezes
everybody and robs banks?

861
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:07,873
Yeah.

862
01:26:09,009 --> 01:26:12,308
- What made you think of that?
- I'm a little tipsy, for one thing.

863
01:26:12,512 --> 01:26:19,008
But your piece sort of reminds me of
that. Like it sort of freezes everything.

864
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:32,021
But you remember what happened
to that guy in "The Twilight Zone"?

865
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:36,325
He froze everything,
and then his stopwatch broke.

866
01:26:46,913 --> 01:26:50,110
Hey, it's Mia. Are you still
at Jett's? Are you still writing?

867
01:26:50,317 --> 01:26:53,343
Yeah. Yeah, no.

868
01:26:53,553 --> 01:26:59,082
I'm sorry. It's gonna be late tonight.
Are you just gonna go to bed?

869
01:26:59,893 --> 01:27:02,657
It's 4 in the morning.
I've got to get up early.

870
01:27:02,996 --> 01:27:05,464
Bye.

871
01:27:15,108 --> 01:27:18,509
Gray... Gray...

872
01:27:19,446 --> 01:27:23,314
Wait. Am I doing it right?
Is it too raspy?

873
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:30,617
I'm so sorry...

874
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:53,236
Gray.

875
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:08,056
I don't want to talk about that.
Just get your shit and let's go.

876
01:28:08,261 --> 01:28:10,991
- What the hell has happened to you?
- What's happened to me?

877
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:12,529
What-the-fuck-has happened to you?!

878
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:13,994
When did you become
such a goddamn flirt?

879
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:15,998
When did you become Jake LaMotta?

880
01:28:16,203 --> 01:28:17,431
One second you're
complaining about how much time...

881
01:28:17,637 --> 01:28:19,070
we're spending on Gray
and then the next, it's:

882
01:28:19,272 --> 01:28:20,671
"Gray this, Gray that...

883
01:28:20,874 --> 01:28:22,739
Gray and I have so
much in common".

884
01:28:22,943 --> 01:28:27,676
I did nothing, nothing to warrant this.
You men are all jealous pigs!

885
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:30,406
Thank God you're not generalizing.

886
01:28:30,617 --> 01:28:34,144
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
You're a jealous pig. Is that better?

887
01:28:34,354 --> 01:28:39,986
Oh, Christ. I put up with so much
shit from you and I never complain.

888
01:28:40,193 --> 01:28:43,185
Maybe if you had
a fucking backbone...

889
01:28:43,396 --> 01:28:44,522
That's right!

890
01:28:44,798 --> 01:28:47,323
That makes me the asshole
for being supportive?

891
01:28:48,301 --> 01:28:51,099
For helping you collect those goddamn
tapes for you to parade your life...

892
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:54,501
Then don't do it! Fuck!

893
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:57,336
You created this situation.
This is what you wanted.

894
01:28:57,544 --> 01:29:00,342
You had me exactly
where you want me.

895
01:29:00,547 --> 01:29:03,948
At least I've ever had something to
show for my misery. Have you?

896
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:06,983
When did you become such a bitch?

897
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:10,748
When you lost all your self-esteem
and became a star-fucker.

898
01:29:10,957 --> 01:29:13,357
You became so excited by the idea
of hanging out with your hero...

899
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,551
that it didn't even occur to you
that he was flirting with me.

900
01:29:15,762 --> 01:29:18,959
And when you did finally notice,
it didn't even dawn on you...

901
01:29:19,165 --> 01:29:22,066
that I wouldn't cheat on you
because I actually love you.

902
01:29:22,535 --> 01:29:24,503
- I love you, I love you.
- Even though you're in love with...

903
01:29:24,704 --> 01:29:25,796
I'm not in love
with Gray fucking Evans!

904
01:29:26,006 --> 01:29:29,533
Then why, John
why do we see him almost every day?

905
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:31,233
Doesn't it strike you
as a little strange...

906
01:29:31,444 --> 01:29:33,241
that we don't know
anything about this guy?

907
01:29:38,318 --> 01:29:39,580
You guys are both bloodsuckers.

908
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:42,778
He hates his life and you
obviously don't have one.

909
01:29:43,523 --> 01:29:48,051
- Fuck you, Jane!
- What did you say to me?

910
01:29:53,266 --> 01:29:55,427
You never said that to me before.

911
01:30:02,142 --> 01:30:05,043
That's the great thing about
conversations like these, I guess.

912
01:30:05,545 --> 01:30:07,240
You get to see the other
one as they really are.

913
01:30:07,447 --> 01:30:10,712
I'm a slut.
And you're a jealous prick.

914
01:30:11,518 --> 01:30:15,420
Let's go. We're late.

915
01:30:16,122 --> 01:30:17,783
Can you put on a happy
face for a couple of hours...

916
01:30:17,991 --> 01:30:21,290
or are we gonna mortify ourselves?

917
01:30:21,594 --> 01:30:23,789
I think I can manage.

918
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,563
One last time.

919
01:30:55,965 --> 01:30:59,423
- Well, that was fun.
- Well, I had fun.

920
01:31:00,369 --> 01:31:01,961
Sylvia Plath would have had fun...

921
01:31:02,104 --> 01:31:05,369
with the amount of vodka
you had to drink tonight.

922
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:09,470
Oh, good one. A hip literary
reference and everything.

923
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:13,748
I was gonna compare you to a
famous conceptual artist...

924
01:31:13,949 --> 01:31:16,975
but there just aren't any.

925
01:31:22,057 --> 01:31:23,820
Do you want to talk about this tonight?

926
01:31:25,227 --> 01:31:27,058
- What's there to talk about?
- What are you saying?

927
01:31:28,063 --> 01:31:30,156
What are you saying?

928
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,597
- Gray?
- Gray.

929
01:31:32,802 --> 01:31:34,667
Gray, you scared me half to death.

930
01:31:39,141 --> 01:31:43,942
- Gray, what are you doing?
- Gray! Gray! Stop it!

931
01:31:47,116 --> 01:31:48,447
Stop!

932
01:31:54,523 --> 01:31:57,219
It's okay.

933
01:32:03,599 --> 01:32:05,692
Could you shut up?

934
01:32:06,335 --> 01:32:09,463
Shut up. Shut up!

935
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:26,687
What, you're such a big time singer?
You'll be a big time singer?

936
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:30,590
Well, you can't sing now,
motherfucker!

937
01:32:52,214 --> 01:32:54,808
I'm really sad right now.

938
01:33:04,727 --> 01:33:07,127
I'm cold.

939
01:33:36,926 --> 01:33:39,895
Hi, I'm afraid I've
done something terrible.

940
01:33:40,095 --> 01:33:45,590
My name is John Eckart.
I live at 611 Rialto Street.

941
01:33:45,801 --> 01:33:51,398
I've kidnapped Gray Evans.
Yeah, the actor.

942
01:33:51,607 --> 01:33:56,101
And I have a gun and I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

943
01:34:37,052 --> 01:34:42,684
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry and I love you.

944
01:34:49,999 --> 01:34:51,728
Gray?

945
01:34:55,704 --> 01:34:59,140
What is it that you want?

946
01:35:03,045 --> 01:35:05,639
You want to be with me?

947
01:35:07,316 --> 01:35:09,181
Is that it?

948
01:35:09,385 --> 01:35:13,185
No, no, no.

949
01:35:13,389 --> 01:35:19,589
This is not about sex.
Really. No.

950
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:34,434
Then what's it about, Gray?

951
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:51,288
Well...

952
01:35:55,164 --> 01:35:59,897
we don't make love anymore.

953
01:36:01,036 --> 01:36:04,369
Why do you think?

954
01:36:07,609 --> 01:36:10,373
I don't know.

955
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:13,079
Maybe...

956
01:36:14,917 --> 01:36:18,717
maybe because you...

957
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:23,984
I can't even say it. Maybe because
you don't love me anymore.

958
01:36:24,193 --> 01:36:29,028
- I don't know you anymore.
- How can you say that?

959
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:32,458
How can you say that?

960
01:36:33,102 --> 01:36:36,503
It's me. I'm right here.

961
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:42,435
Do you love me?

962
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:51,285
God, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit.

963
01:36:53,522 --> 01:36:58,983
- I'm so sorry.
- Stop it. Stop apologizing.

964
01:36:59,328 --> 01:37:03,355
And stop acting like an innocent
baby. You fucked around on me.

965
01:37:04,233 --> 01:37:10,069
You're a drunk. You cry and you
apologize, and you'd do it again.

966
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:15,042
How can you expect
me to put up with that?

967
01:37:17,446 --> 01:37:19,107
How?

968
01:37:26,788 --> 01:37:29,279
Because we love each other.

969
01:37:33,295 --> 01:37:35,855
We used to love each other.

970
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:38,294
When you used to say things like:

971
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:43,563
"Shana, before I met you, all I
cared about was work and success.

972
01:37:43,772 --> 01:37:46,798
But I swear, none of that
means shit without you".

973
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:50,743
Remember that?
One movie, Gray.

974
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:55,807
You star in one movie
and you join the ranks.

975
01:37:57,019 --> 01:37:58,611
You're your own worst nightmare.

976
01:37:59,955 --> 01:38:02,355
You're just like everyone else.

977
01:38:04,026 --> 01:38:05,789
You're obvious.

978
01:38:07,129 --> 01:38:10,121
You get a little taste
of success and...

979
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:19,798
John Eckart, this is the police
department! We've received your call!

980
01:38:20,008 --> 01:38:21,475
We're here to help you!

981
01:38:22,678 --> 01:38:24,509
We promise you,
no harm will come to you!

982
01:38:24,813 --> 01:38:29,216
Jesus, that's a little much for a
little argument. Don't you think?

983
01:38:31,553 --> 01:38:34,579
I always said you
were a 4-alarm fire.

984
01:38:35,724 --> 01:38:37,783
It's over, Gray.

985
01:38:48,904 --> 01:38:50,997
John, pick up the phone!

986
01:38:55,611 --> 01:39:01,675
One of your boyfriends? I'm kidding.
I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

987
01:39:02,684 --> 01:39:04,515
You have to let me go.

988
01:39:09,725 --> 01:39:13,525
- What?
- You have to let me go.

989
01:39:16,331 --> 01:39:18,094
No.

990
01:39:36,018 --> 01:39:38,009
We have a cut.
Gray, was that good for you?

991
01:39:56,672 --> 01:39:59,971
- It's Mia Lang. Mr. Evan's wife.
- He's my husband!

992
01:40:00,175 --> 01:40:03,303
Who are you?
Who's in charge here?

993
01:40:03,512 --> 01:40:05,480
- John Eckart!
- That's not him.

994
01:40:05,681 --> 01:40:06,978
Drop the weapon!

995
01:40:07,182 --> 01:40:09,082
John, drop the gun!

996
01:40:30,839 --> 01:40:33,467
Gray! Gray!

997
01:40:35,777 --> 01:40:38,803
- Gray!
- John! Put the gun down!

998
01:40:50,826 --> 01:40:55,229
- Drop the weapon!
- How about a smile, Gray?

999
01:40:56,331 --> 01:40:58,231
- Smile!
- Over here!

1000
01:41:11,146 --> 01:41:13,137
...was gunned down
by police late last night...

1001
01:41:13,348 --> 01:41:15,680
when they mistook him
for his own kidnapper...

1002
01:41:15,884 --> 01:41:18,648
an aspiring filmmaker whose
friendship with Evans...

1003
01:41:18,854 --> 01:41:21,823
apparently became
a fatal obsession.

1004
01:41:22,023 --> 01:41:25,254
Gray Evans, who first made a
splash only a few years ago...

1005
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:29,260
promised to be one of the
screen's brightest stars.

1006
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:55,650
My girl was the only girl.

1007
01:41:56,258 --> 01:41:58,954
We used to watch
the sunset together.

1008
01:41:59,161 --> 01:42:01,527
She used to call it "magic hour".

1009
01:42:29,524 --> 01:42:32,925
I'm so sorry, Shana, baby

1010
01:42:33,128 --> 01:42:36,962
I wanted to do laundry with you

1011
01:42:37,165 --> 01:42:40,794
That's all right, little man

1012
01:42:41,002 --> 01:42:44,130
How'd you do?

1013
01:42:44,339 --> 01:42:48,105
Well, it was good, but I know

1014
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:52,337
I shouldn't get too riled

1015
01:42:52,547 --> 01:42:56,313
You're cute when you're riled

1016
01:42:56,518 --> 01:43:00,113
How about some food?

1017
01:43:00,322 --> 01:43:03,587
See, that's why I'm really excited

1018
01:43:03,792 --> 01:43:07,888
Cause I bought these 2
big heads of iceberg

1019
01:43:08,096 --> 01:43:11,395
Does someone want
his favorite salad?

1020
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:15,397
Somebody maybe might

1021
01:43:15,604 --> 01:43:18,630
Because my baby needs

1022
01:43:19,207 --> 01:43:22,472
To lose a few

1023
01:43:23,144 --> 01:43:26,739
- I missed you all day
- I missed you more

1024
01:43:26,948 --> 01:43:32,045
Let's never spend more than
4 hours apart, what do you say?

1025
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:33,778
I say okay

1026
01:43:34,256 --> 01:43:38,317
Did you get some good stuff today?

1027
01:43:38,527 --> 01:43:42,429
The sky was so crazy blue

1028
01:43:42,631 --> 01:43:48,160
Hey, good looking,
let me get a shot of you

1029
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,072
- Perfect.
- Come on.

1030
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:50,027
You're gonna leave me for
her someday, aren't you?
