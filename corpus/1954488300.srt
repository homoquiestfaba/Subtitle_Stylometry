I'll call the air force, I guess.

1114

You can't. They hate Martians.

1115
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:40,845
- They'll shoot and drop nuciear bombs.
- I don't know about bombs...

1116

They're just stupid.

1119
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:51,289
They haven't really hurt anybody.

That's all you care
about, your stupid badge.
