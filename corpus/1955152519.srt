1
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:04,343
Every so often I dream of
my brother's face on fire.

2
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:14,550
In that darkness,
I'm eleven again.

3
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:19,720
An age before I knew
the color of money.

4
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:23,899
Before I learned to lie and cheat.

5
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:29,833
And before I learned how to win.

6
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:23,689
Back then, my life was
school, food and games.

7
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,041
Oat.

8
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,816
- Where's your brother?
- Probably outside.

9
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:52,419
Go get him.
It's time to eat.

10
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,993
After our dad died,
his sister became our new guardian.

11
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,995
To help out, my brother quit
school and started working.

12
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:16,638
- Hey, Oat.
- What's up, Jai?

13
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:18,809
What do you want?

14
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,981
Auntie said to come eat.

15
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:25,717
Damn it.

16
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,991
Don't touch my bike.

17
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,992
It's my bike, too.

18
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:32,929
It's yours when you learn to ride it.

19
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:36,032
I can't learn if you never teach me.

20
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:39,059
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

21
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,998
- Want to stay for dinner?
- Sure.

22
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,909
Jai was Ek's boyfriend.

23
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,036
They'd been together since high school.

24
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,743
Jai was richer.

25
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,557
Taller.

26
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,886
And whiter.

27
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,030
He was everything Ek wasn't.

28
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:17,532
They lived in different worlds.

29
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,639
What Ek saw as white,
Jai saw as black.

30
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,611
What Ek heard as music.

31
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:31,185
Jai felt as noise.

32
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,625
I think that's what kept
them together for so long.

33
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,532
Despite what others said.

34
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,480
- Oat, stop it.
- What?

35
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,815
- Hello, Auntie.
- Can Jai stay for dinner?

36
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:04,987
Thank you.

37
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,224
Only vegetables again?

38
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,488
You're more than welcome
to bring in your own food.

39
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,655
This arrived for you today.

40
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,741
Draft Lottery Notification

41
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,975
Ow, Kwan!

42
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:35,043
You act like you're four years old.

43
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,088
If you're gonna play with your food
then don't eat.

44
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:40,753
Oat, where are you going?

45
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:43,618
I'm not hungry.

46
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:47,126
My poor baby.
Are you hurt?

47
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,678
Our father didn't leave us much.

48
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:12,612
Just debt on this house
and the old bike.

49
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,192
Hurry up, son.

50
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,869
My mom died before
I got to know her.

51
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:40,708
Luckily, my dad was
always there for us.

52
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,128
Dad, I want to try that one.

53
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,230
Try your luck at fish scooping.

54
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:06,365
- Here you go.
- 5 tries for 20 baht.

55
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,377
Take it easy, kid.

56
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,646
That's too bad.

57
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:23,159
That's okay.
Here's a new one.

58
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,287
Let your Dad try one time.

59
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:31,064
- Catch a lot.
- Hand me that bucket.

60
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:32,964
Watch this.

61
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:41,701
The trick is to let it float first.

62
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,708
Dad, get the big one.

63
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,883
That one.

64
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,287
- The blue one.
- That's the big one.

65
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:14,336
A construction worker fell from
the 22nd floor of a construction site.

66
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:20,374
The site is a new condominium
right in the heart of Bangkok.

67
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:33,890
Hungry?

68
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,230
Not really.

69
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:39,727
Want to play checkers?

70
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,995
Okay. Where's Jai?

71
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:43,829
Went home.

72
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,411
Ek. You going out tonight?

73
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,876
- Why do you care?
- Can I go?

74
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,452
No way.

75
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:59,483
But last time you promised.

76
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:03,453
I said, I'd take you out if you beat me.
You got to win first.

77
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:17,797
Hurry up.

78
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:19,943
Hold on.

79
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:24,806
Here's good.

80
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:27,343
Thank you.

81
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,518
I win, again.

82
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,516
We never heard Kwan come or go.

83
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,091
She just appeared
and then was gone.

84
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,095
What the hell?

85
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,304
Ek didn't masturbate for weeks after that.

86
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,001
Clean this up.

87
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,538
But I didn't do it!

88
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,968
I don't care.
Clean it up.

89
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,007
Stupid chicken.

90
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,386
Ek did his best to take care of me.

91
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:44,586
For my birthday,
he knew exactly what I wanted.

92
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,060
You hungry?

93
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,061
Welcome to Big Burger.

94
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:56,402
One hamburger set, please.

95
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:57,896
Double cheese set.

96
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,600
- What?
- Double cheese set.

97
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,038
The double cheese set, please.

98
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:07,483
One double cheese set.
That'll be 169 baht.

99
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:16,889
- You're not ordering anything?
- I ate already.

100
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:19,929
Hey.

101
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,268
That's Thung.
But everyone called him Junior.

102
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:31,171
His father ran the black market.

103
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:34,203
The black market lottery,
the Muay Thai fights,

104
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:36,237
The black market everything.

105
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:44,247
Junior's dad owned everything
in the neighborhood.

106
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,217
He owned the buildings,
the restaurants, the shops.

107
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,292
He even owned our house.

108
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:01,037
Excuse me,
your double cheeseburger is ready.

109
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,302
Your double cheeseburger is ready.

110
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,178
Welcome to Big Burger.

111
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,522
Want some?
I can't eat this by myself.

112
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,464
Eat up, kid.
It's your birthday.

113
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,004
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

114
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,437
That was the first time I tasted cheese.

115
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,575
I remember it smelling like a dead fish.

116
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,445
Rotting in the garbage.

117
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,657
Oh, you pussy.

118
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,995
Dude blew some chunks.

119
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,293
- I'm sorry.
- Come on. Get up!

120
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:12,039
That's the last time I'm taking you out.

121
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:20,474
The draft is next week.

122
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:23,577
Are you ready for it?

123
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,524
Auntie, it's a lottery.
How can I prepare for a lottery?

124
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:30,493
You prepare your mind and you pray.

125
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,523
Pray for what?

126
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:35,029
Pray for black.

127
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,430
Auntie was probably
the most superstitious person I knew.

128
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:44,733
She released fish every
week for good karma.

129
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:50,406
It never really seemed to help her though.

130
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,140
Oh my God!

131
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:01,454
I'm serious.
What if you get drafted?

132
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,288
You'll be gone for two years.
Who will take care of Oat?

133
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:08,360
I can't take care of two kids myself.

134
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,498
Well, what do you want me to do?

135
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:13,703
Why don't you go talk with Junior's dad?

136
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,172
Maybe he can help you.

137
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:20,243
Why would he help me?
All I do is work at his bar.

138
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:24,112
Then show him how valuable you are.

139
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,751
You hear Jong is
volunteering for the draft?

140
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,564
Dumbass.

141
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:45,427
At least he can go home early.
It's going to be so long.

142
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,702
Think of all the guys that'll be there.

143
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,535
How many numbers do you think I'll get?

144
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,476
Hey.
Haven't you already had enough?

145
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,672
Kitty was not your average girl.

146
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:05,288
She wasn't your average boy either.

147
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:11,424
Hi, Kitty.

148
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:14,262
Hi, Kitty.

149
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:16,557
You slut.

150
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,603
You're just jealous
I get all the guys.

151
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,299
That's because you like getting fucked.

152
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:26,103
Some guys ask to be fucked, too.

153
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:31,179
Can you imagine Kitty with a rifle?

154
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:34,146
- Actually, I can.
- What's so funny?

155
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:37,480
- Jai!
- Yes?

156
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:41,154
- Can you come down here?
- Okay.

157
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,286
- Can I play?
- No.

158
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,900
Hey.

159
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:53,730
Where are you going?

160
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,867
What, I can't go to the bathroom?

161
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:01,508
We have always depended
on your good graces.

162
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:04,738
I'll take care of it.

163
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:08,542
I have a son so I know how you feel.

164
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:13,455
You have nothing to worry about.
Just have Jai show up at the lottery.

165
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,323
It's not a lot, but please accept this.

166
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,559
Your son, there are so many
other useful things he can do.

167
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,568
Okay, please excuse me.

168
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,771
At 11:40am, there was an explosion
on the road in the South.

169
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:04,440
One solider was killed in the incident.

170
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:08,343
Police found three explosive devices
at the scene.

171
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:17,779
- Ek?
- Yeah?

172
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:21,286
Did you talk to Junior's dad about the draft?

173
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:24,884
- Why do you care?
- I'm just asking.

174
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:29,421
I heard if you bribe him,
he'll help you out.

175
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,526
Well, even if it were true,

176
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:36,298
We ain't got no money
to bribe him with.

177
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,299
- Ready?
- No.

178
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,372
- Let's go.
- I'm not ready.

179
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,304
Stop it.
I'm not ready!

180
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,846
I told you I wasn't ready!

181
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,318
You want some?

182
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:57,590
A new method of making methamphetamine
is becoming more popular.

183
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,954
Hey, look who it is.

184
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,456
Come here.

185
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:39,328
Give me that.

186
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,631
- Want some?
- No.

187
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,863
Just try it.

188
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:45,373
- No!
- Your brother does it all the time.

189
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:46,568
I don't want to.

190
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:50,709
Want more?

191
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,979
Hey! Oat?

192
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,079
Junior.
Leave him alone.

193
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,012
We were just playing.

194
00:19:58,355 --> 00:19:59,754
Playing, my ass.

195
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:02,347
Come on, Oat.

196
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,651
Where're you going?

197
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:05,690
You bitch.

198
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:06,660
Fuck off!

199
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:08,822
Before you get fucked in the ass.

200
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,435
I think she likes me.

201
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,409
- Are you hurt?
- No.

202
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,807
What were you doing there anyways?

203
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,885
It's a shortcut home.

204
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,916
Shortcut?

205
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,917
Well, don't come here alone anymore.
It's dangerous.

206
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:39,925
You understand?

207
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,600
Are you going to tell Ek?

208
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,799
Not if you don't want me to.

209
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:52,374
Then I won't.

210
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:54,967
Let's go.

211
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,497
Oat.

212
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,795
Can you watch Kwan
for a couple of hours?

213
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,026
I have to go clean a house.

214
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:22,867
Why do I have to watch her?

215
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,030
Why do I have to watch you?

216
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:32,005
Kwan, be a good girl.
Mommy will be right back.

217
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,024
Bye bye.

218
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,684
Go! Go! Go!

219
00:22:46,957 --> 00:22:49,050
Oat! Kwan!

220
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:52,653
What are you doing?

221
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:54,296
We're releasing animals for...

222
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:55,964
You brat!

223
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:58,491
Look at the house!

224
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,826
I've been cleaning houses all day.

225
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,672
And now I come home
to clean another one.

226
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:06,038
Breaking that statue
will give us bad luck.

227
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,972
Get inside.
Now!

228
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:12,199
Where did you get this?

229
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,936
Do you know how dangerous drugs are?

230
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:18,037
It's not a drug.
It's just a popper.

231
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:21,082
You think I'm stupid?

232
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:23,150
Tell me where you got it.

233
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,881
It's not mine.
It's Jai's.

234
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,120
I knew it.

235
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,851
You knew what?

236
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:33,687
Ek.

237
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:37,128
You can date any guy you want.

238
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,100
But trust me.

239
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:42,772
Relationships like you
and Jai don't work out.

240
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:45,234
You're only going to get hurt.

241
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,683
Remember when we first came here?

242
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,112
Yeah, and you tried to kiss me?

243
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:03,724
No, you tried to kiss me.

244
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:09,696
That was so long ago.
We were still in school.

245
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:15,967
You think we'll still be together,
if one of us gets drafted?

246
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:20,674
Of course.
Why would that matter?

247
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,638
What if I get red?

248
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:30,048
What's going to happen to Oat?

249
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:36,316
If you pick red,
and get drafted,

250
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:38,988
I can take care of him.

251
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,731
Yeah, but what if you get red.

252
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:47,195
And get drafted, too.

253
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:41,049
How to Win at Checkers
(Every Time)

254
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,184
In the game of checkers,
every move counts.

255
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:51,361
To win, you must always be
two steps ahead of your opponent.

256
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:54,065
Let's start with the first rule of checkers.

257
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:58,004
Rule #1: Look before you leap.

258
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,941
Give it back!

259
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:09,816
Stop it!

260
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:28,537
Rule #2: The best defense
is a good offense.

261
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:55,157
You know my dad's on my back.

262
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:57,995
You better be glad I came here
instead of my dad.

263
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,290
Understand?

264
00:27:59,836 --> 00:28:02,066
Junior, you don't have to do that.

265
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,473
How long do you need then?

266
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:06,936
Just give me a few more days.

267
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,864
Rule #3: If you at first
don't succeed, try, try again.

268
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,049
Oat?
What are you doing in there?

269
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,551
Go give this to Auntie.

270
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:33,214
What's wrong?
Were you crying again?

271
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:35,291
No, dust got into my eyes.

272
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,715
Why are you so sensitive?

273
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,252
I said I wasn't crying.

274
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,002
What's that?

275
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,535
I brought it for you.

276
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:00,674
Grilled chicken?

277
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,388
Help me pass these out.

278
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:39,316
Who is it?

279
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,553
Come in.

280
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:52,063
- Afternoon, sir.
- Hey, sport.

281
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,536
What is it?

282
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:59,334
Can you help my brother?

283
00:32:01,277 --> 00:32:02,539
Who?

284
00:32:04,147 --> 00:32:07,742
Ekkachai Rattanaram.
He works for you.

285
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,319
Ekkachai?
Oh yeah.

286
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:13,646
The bartender boy?

287
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,785
How can I help him?

288
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:20,396
Can you help him in the draft?

289
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,341
Where did you get this?

290
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,337
My Aunt told me to give it to you.

291
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,448
Do you know what I do to
people who steal from me?

292
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:55,756
Do you know what I do to
people who steal from me?

293
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,332
No, please.
I only did it for Ek.

294
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,435
What do you mean
you did it for Ek?

295
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:10,637
You think saying sorry is enough?

296
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:13,146
What are you going to do about this?

297
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,210
If you were me,
what would you do?

298
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:23,188
From now on,
you go work upstairs.

299
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,684
Get out.

300
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,328
What happened?

301
00:33:37,206 --> 00:33:39,902
- It's taken care of.
- Nice work, bro.

302
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:42,335
Damn it.

303
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:44,804
Don't do that again.

304
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,871
I was doing this for you.

305
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:48,580
Who asked you?

306
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:51,376
Stealing isn't going to
get you anywhere in life.

307
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:55,213
It'll only cause more problems.
You understand?

308
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:16,434
Are you still angry at him?

309
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,679
- He's just a kid.
- Exactly.

310
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:23,408
He needs to grow up.

311
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,251
But if it you were him,
wouldn't you try to do something, too?

312
00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:35,523
No, I wouldn't.

313
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:51,970
But you said yourself,
you were worried about him.

314
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:59,721
What does that have to do with bribing?

315
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:21,908
Come back here.

316
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:26,005
What did I do wrong?

317
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:29,779
- Just come here.
- What for?

318
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,311
Try to start it up.

319
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:34,683
Really?

320
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:44,026
Look here.

321
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,867
Just like that.

322
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:51,430
Let's go for a ride.

323
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,349
Okay.

324
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,885
Now shift up to second gear.

325
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,447
Pull the clutch.

326
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:10,852
I said shift up.

327
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:13,054
Come on.

328
00:36:13,596 --> 00:36:16,497
Got it?
Now speed it up.

329
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,869
Okay, slow it down.

330
00:36:31,013 --> 00:36:32,844
That's enough, stop.

331
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:36,945
What's wrong?

332
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:40,544
You can't go out there.
Where would you go?

333
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,825
This is stupid.

334
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,027
You know what's stupid?

335
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:49,023
You can't even start the bike
and you want to go out?

336
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,031
Move.

337
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:29,461
Get up.
Jai's here already.

338
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,381
Wear these.
And this watch, too.

339
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:45,952
- What is this?
- I borrowed it from a friend.

340
00:37:46,122 --> 00:37:48,613
It's fake.
But don't tell anybody that.

341
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:52,991
Do I have to wear it?

342
00:37:53,162 --> 00:37:56,791
Today's an important day.
It's better if you look good.

343
00:38:00,703 --> 00:38:03,934
Auntie.
No one else is going to dress up.

344
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,738
Wear it.
Just listen to me.

345
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,216
Ek.

346
00:38:57,493 --> 00:38:59,154
Be sure to give this to them.

347
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:05,196
"Death certificate:
Mr. And Mrs. Rattanaram"

348
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:08,529
Stop it!
I'll do it myself.

349
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:10,869
I'll be at the temple by noon.

350
00:39:11,507 --> 00:39:13,907
And take Oat with you.

351
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,239
Oat.
Let's go.

352
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,909
Bye, Auntie.

353
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,652
Think black.
That's what we want.

354
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:30,747
Go sit over there.

355
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:34,817
Hey Ek.

356
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,189
Hey Kitty.

357
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:41,654
- Sexy.
- You, too.

358
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,729
Please stand for the national anthem.

359
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:53,768
Thailand unites its people
with flesh and blood.

360
00:40:53,976 --> 00:40:58,345
Land of Thailand belongs to the Thais.

361
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:03,613
It has long maintained its sovereignty.

362
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:08,617
For the Thais seek love and unity.

363
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:13,691
Thai are peace-loving,
but fight with courage.

364
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:18,898
No tyrant can take away their freedoms.

365
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:23,665
Sacrificing every drop of blood for the nation.

366
00:41:23,973 --> 00:41:29,070
Long last the nation's pride and victory.

367
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:39,017
Good morning, everybody.

368
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:45,151
By law, every male turning twenty-one
must participate in the draft lottery.

369
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:51,225
The registration will begin soon.
So wait for your name to be called.

370
00:41:59,675 --> 00:42:01,870
Hey. Want to go celebrate after this?

371
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:07,679
- What did Junior want?
- Nothing.

372
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,109
Let's wait over there.

373
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:31,272
Number 158.

374
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:43,679
What's this?
Just give me your ID.

375
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:55,227
Number 159.

376
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:02,235
Number 160.

377
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:17,747
95-98.
Pass.

378
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:19,715
Number 137.

379
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,417
182 cm.

380
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:28,061
99.
Pass.

381
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:31,064
Number 293.

382
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,074
178 cm.

383
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:47,972
90-93.
Pass.

384
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:50,080
Everyone take off your shirts.

385
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,814
Stand up.

386
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,225
Palms up.

387
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:02,826
Fatso!

388
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:04,764
Squat down.

389
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:07,196
Stand up.

390
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:11,467
You...

391
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:15,100
No need to draw.
You can go home.

392
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,939
Next line, take off your shirts.

393
00:44:26,822 --> 00:44:27,982
Stand up.

394
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:31,516
Take a step closer.

395
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,434
- Did you have your operation already?
- Not yet.

396
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,936
- What about hormone pills?
- Two years.

397
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:48,035
Okay, go over to line two.

398
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,968
- I don't need to draw?
- No need.

399
00:44:57,186 --> 00:44:58,483
Palms up.

400
00:45:09,398 --> 00:45:12,367
Excuse me.
Sorry, excuse me.

401
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:16,932
Where is Ek?

402
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:27,409
Today, we've been performing
our duty as individuals.

403
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:30,017
There are a total of 120 cards.

404
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,147
35 of them are red.

405
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,118
Whether you draw red or black.

406
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:40,984
Totally depends on your luck and nothing else.

407
00:45:41,563 --> 00:45:44,259
But those who pick red,
are actually the luckiest ones.

408
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:46,528
Lucky, my ass.

409
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,367
Because you can serve your country.

410
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:53,505
When I call your name,
step up to the front.

411
00:45:53,642 --> 00:45:55,322
Open your hand in the air before you pick.

412
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:59,310
Then wait until we read out the card.

413
00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:01,883
- Everyone understand?
- Yes sir.

414
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:04,451
Okay, we will now start the lottery.

415
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,892
Rattawut Lapcharoensap.

416
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,088
Red! Red! Red!

417
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,472
Black!

418
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:32,337
Siwakorn Rodcheow.

419
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,527
The Navy welcomes the new recruit.

420
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:54,465
It's red!

421
00:46:57,673 --> 00:47:00,164
Phummitad Lertrungwichien.

422
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,375
Red! Red! Red!

423
00:47:11,653 --> 00:47:12,585
Black!

424
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:18,520
Brother Atipat Kwanjan.

425
00:47:22,264 --> 00:47:23,697
Red, little buddy!

426
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:33,533
Black!

427
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:39,446
Sarawut Pitak.

428
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,647
Black!

429
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,220
Porramet Shumnuan.

430
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:06,265
Black!

431
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:14,509
Ekkachai Rattanaram.

432
00:48:36,471 --> 00:48:38,530
Red!
To the army!

433
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:58,054
The rest of the lottery was
like a dream to me now.

434
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:04,265
I don't remember much at all.

435
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:09,170
It's going to be okay.

436
00:49:27,122 --> 00:49:30,523
When the boys in the back
of the line went to the front,

437
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,791
They pulled out black card.

438
00:49:34,563 --> 00:49:36,258
After black card.

439
00:49:36,565 --> 00:49:38,760
Nuttawut Yuyingchareon.

440
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:49,368
Like magicians pulling rabbits out of a hat.

441
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,217
Black!

442
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,784
Lerd Ritkajorn Sombat.

443
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:18,900
Black!

444
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,641
Ek, wait up.

445
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,562
Ek, please.

446
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:46,862
I promise I won't bother you.
I'll sit in the corner by myself.

447
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,829
Come on, please?

448
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:03,641
Go set up the checkers board.

449
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,335
Ek, go!

450
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:29,275
Hold on.

451
00:51:37,686 --> 00:51:38,983
That was dumb.

452
00:51:42,757 --> 00:51:45,282
Did you learn anything from that book?

453
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,672
That's called the
"Stupid Buffalo" trap.

454
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:01,735
Damn.

455
00:52:02,377 --> 00:52:04,572
- Oat.
- Yes

456
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:06,840
- Come up here.
- Okay.

457
00:52:08,483 --> 00:52:11,350
- I won.
- Winning, my ass.

458
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:16,791
Oat.

459
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:20,886
While Ek is in the army,
you better not eat any meat.

460
00:52:21,363 --> 00:52:22,557
Why?

461
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:25,493
You have no respect for the gods.

462
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:28,997
Auntie.
He can eat whatever he wants.

463
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:33,653
I'm going to take him out with me tonight.

464
00:52:33,675 --> 00:52:34,767
Really?

465
00:52:34,976 --> 00:52:36,307
To where?

466
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:39,608
Ice-skating.

467
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:44,979
Oh right, ice-skating.
I love ice-skating.

468
00:52:45,654 --> 00:52:46,746
Go get ready.

469
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,424
When you get back we need to talk.

470
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:52,516
About what to do while
you're in the army.

471
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:54,752
I'll send you money, don't worry.

472
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,363
Like your army paycheck
will make a difference.

473
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,325
Oat! Stop that!

474
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,995
Give me that.
Go get ready.

475
00:53:13,948 --> 00:53:16,781
Ice-skating, I love ice-skating.

476
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:18,845
Eat shit, Ek.

477
00:53:19,954 --> 00:53:23,481
- Do you want to go or not?
- Just hurry up.

478
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,754
I can't believe I beat you!

479
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:30,020
You didn't win.
I still had one piece left.

480
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:38,865
This is where you work?

481
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,662
Feel free to go home.

482
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,634
You go home.

483
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:49,033
Then stop complaining.

484
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:18,169
Hey. You came.

485
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,437
Kitty, what are you doing here?

486
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:24,806
I work here.
What are you doing here?

487
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:27,879
Hey, what's with the babysitting?

488
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,877
I couldn't leave him home alone.

489
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,188
Hey kid. You hungry?

490
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:35,953
Want a cheeseburger?

491
00:55:36,558 --> 00:55:37,525
No, thanks.

492
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:40,016
Just pretend he's not here.

493
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,724
Can you keep your eyes to yourself?

494
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,532
Hey, little buddy.

495
00:55:56,044 --> 00:55:57,602
Tell you something.

496
00:55:58,246 --> 00:56:00,043
Be careful where you put your dick.

497
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:02,649
The AIDS might eat it up.

498
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,547
He's got no clue.

499
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:13,757
Who's the handsome boy?

500
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:16,860
My virgin brother.

501
00:56:17,031 --> 00:56:18,726
That makes two of us.

502
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,869
It's getting to that time of the night.

503
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,938
Leaving already?

504
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,767
Don't worry.
I'll be back.

505
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,975
To give you what you want.

506
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:38,980
- You stay here.
- No, I'm coming with you.

507
00:56:39,053 --> 00:56:41,248
Remember you lost.

508
00:57:16,124 --> 00:57:18,786
Who's shaking it?

509
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,025
I shook it last time.

510
00:57:23,331 --> 00:57:25,094
Want to shake it for us?

511
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:31,567
Give it to me.

512
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,804
That's enough.

513
00:57:41,115 --> 00:57:42,207
Ek.

514
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:45,249
Stop it.
It's gonna explode.

515
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,861
Stop it.
It's going to explode.

516
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,731
See, it's done.

517
00:58:07,909 --> 00:58:12,141
Out of all the desperate things
I would later learn to do,

518
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,974
I wonder why it's that dream

519
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,715
That haunts me over and over again.

520
00:58:36,404 --> 00:58:38,065
Hey there, handsome.

521
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,938
That's my brother.

522
00:58:41,743 --> 00:58:44,303
I know.
You told me already.

523
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:46,312
He's a little high.

524
00:58:46,781 --> 00:58:49,750
I can see that.
What about you?

525
00:58:50,018 --> 00:58:53,112
- Nope.
- Ever been?

526
00:58:53,254 --> 00:58:55,245
Of course.
Plenty of times.

527
00:58:56,924 --> 00:59:00,087
Hey!
Since when did you smoke?

528
00:59:00,361 --> 00:59:02,761
Back when you were still a man.

529
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,294
That was cruel.

530
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:10,200
Good evening.

531
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:12,966
Hello.

532
00:59:13,408 --> 00:59:14,841
Can we help you?

533
00:59:15,777 --> 00:59:17,039
How much for him?

534
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:22,376
He's not working today.
How about another boy?

535
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:25,185
Art.
Come over here.

536
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,789
I don't want another boy.
I saw him working here last night.

537
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,892
How much for this one?

538
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,297
I like this one.

539
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:43,231
5,000 for the kid.

540
00:59:44,005 --> 00:59:45,267
There's 5,000.

541
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:49,236
5,000?

542
00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:51,304
5,000?
Okay, let's go.

543
00:59:51,345 --> 00:59:54,337
That was just a joke.

544
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:57,782
If you aren't going to pay
then leave.

545
00:59:59,787 --> 01:00:00,845
Fine.

546
01:00:02,457 --> 01:00:03,355
Let's go.

547
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:15,858
Ek, what about Oat?

548
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:17,734
He'll be fine.

549
01:00:17,972 --> 01:00:21,169
- Right?
- Yeah. I'm not a baby anymore.

550
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:25,531
You don't have to act
so tough all the time.

551
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:29,783
Tell you what,

552
01:00:30,218 --> 01:00:32,277
I'm going to go upstairs for a bit.

553
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:35,180
Then I'll take you home.

554
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:13,490
Who's the kid?

555
01:01:13,861 --> 01:01:15,328
Ek's little brother.

556
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,190
Oh, the one who broke
into Junior's dad's car?

557
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:23,232
Nice one.
You got some balls man.

558
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,365
Isn't that why Ek
started working upstairs?

559
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:27,967
Be quiet.

560
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,435
What?
What did I say?

561
01:01:33,347 --> 01:01:34,371
Shut up.

562
01:01:39,053 --> 01:01:40,884
I'm going to the bathroom.

563
01:03:32,066 --> 01:03:33,658
What the hell you doing here?

564
01:03:33,968 --> 01:03:36,960
I should kill you for being here.
Snap your fucking head off.

565
01:03:37,038 --> 01:03:38,164
Ek! Ek!

566
01:03:39,173 --> 01:03:40,037
Hey!

567
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:45,269
Let go of him.

568
01:03:45,379 --> 01:03:47,279
Get him out of here.

569
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,943
You know he can't be up here.

570
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:51,314
Just go down!

571
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,443
You, okay?

572
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,130
Why are you doing this?

573
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:09,432
Is it because of me?

574
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:16,436
Not everything is about you, kid.

575
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:25,184
You'll understand when you grow up.

576
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,079
Alright, buddy?

577
01:04:33,594 --> 01:04:36,085
See.
I told you he was working upstairs.

578
01:04:42,136 --> 01:04:43,194
Jai.

579
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,039
What do you want?

580
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:49,776
It's not what you think.

581
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:52,705
How do you know what I'm thinking?

582
01:04:58,386 --> 01:04:59,785
You had to do what you had to do.

583
01:05:04,425 --> 01:05:06,120
So did I.

584
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,790
We live in different worlds.

585
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,574
I told you.

586
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,308
If you got drafted,

587
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,777
I'd take care of Oat.

588
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,717
No thanks.

589
01:05:47,301 --> 01:05:48,290
Come on, Oat.

590
01:05:48,602 --> 01:05:49,728
Let's go home.

591
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,792
Ek, wait up.

592
01:06:57,738 --> 01:06:59,228
Going home already?

593
01:07:00,508 --> 01:07:02,738
Let's put your kid brother in the dump.

594
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:07,171
- Maybe next time.
- What next time?

595
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,178
You drive.

596
01:07:14,522 --> 01:07:17,457
- Are you serious?
- It's yours now.

597
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,488
If you say so.

598
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:30,666
Can you even start it up?

599
01:08:02,803 --> 01:08:04,430
Are you sleeping, Ek?

600
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,441
Keep your eyes on the road.

601
01:08:15,282 --> 01:08:17,716
- Speed up.
- What?

602
01:08:18,619 --> 01:08:20,610
I said go faster.

603
01:08:31,999 --> 01:08:33,557
Good. You've got it.

604
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,609
That was the first and last time
my brother took me out.

605
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:55,484
After Ek was drafted,
he was sent to the South on patrol.

606
01:08:56,991 --> 01:09:00,893
They say that
when death comes for you,

607
01:09:01,462 --> 01:09:03,657
There's nothing you can do to stop it.

608
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:25,678
A soldier was killed this
morning in the South.

609
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:31,519
This is the 7th fatal shooting this year.

610
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:44,329
At the funeral, the general told me,

611
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:49,404
I should be proud of Ek.

612
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:54,980
That he died serving our country.

613
01:09:57,584 --> 01:10:00,849
That he had paid the ultimate sacrifice.

614
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,855
For the nation,

615
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:08,686
For religion,

616
01:10:10,531 --> 01:10:12,829
And for the monarchy.

617
01:10:30,884 --> 01:10:35,844
After Ek died, I threw
away all his things.

618
01:10:41,729 --> 01:10:46,462
They reminded me of the fate
that was to become my own.

619
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,441
You hungry?

620
01:10:58,512 --> 01:10:59,843
I told you I wasn't ready!

621
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:02,977
You want some?

622
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,680
That's called the
"Stupid Buffalo" trap.

623
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:09,147
Damn.

624
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:13,023
Take it easy.

625
01:11:15,095 --> 01:11:17,154
Not everything is about you, kid.

626
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,005
You'll understand when you grow up.

627
01:11:26,974 --> 01:11:28,908
Alright, buddy?

628
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:22,554
I learned at a very young age
how adults do business in this world.

629
01:12:24,097 --> 01:12:29,592
Rule #4: Do whatever it takes to win.

630
01:12:31,038 --> 01:12:36,499
Even if it means
someone else has to lose.

631
01:13:04,938 --> 01:13:05,666
Black!

632
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,942
Urupong Rattanaram.

633
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:33,798
Black!
