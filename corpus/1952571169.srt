1
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,964
Don't worry.

2
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,466
You don't trust me?

3
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,968
I got the money.

4
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,471
Let's see the stuff.

5
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,972
Let's see the money.

6
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,480
Money.

7
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,273
This is sugar!

8
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,502
No shit?

9
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,009
Yeah, no shit.

10
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,808
And this...

11
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,939
is gasoIine.

12
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,817
Come on,
torch him, man!

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,250
Aah!

14
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,995
Oh! Aah!

15
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,010
Mrs. GauItier,

16
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,511
I'm sorry
this happened

17
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,945
to your famiIy.

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,279
We've done
everything we couId.

19
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,784
In cases Iike this,
it is very difficuIt

20
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,821
to make any kind
of prediction,

21
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,255
so for the next coupIe of months,
it's going to be touch and go.

22
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,917
Mrs. GauItier--

23
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,018
The insurance
has expired, I know.

24
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:22,758
Does he have any other reIatives,
anyone eIse that couId possibIy heIp?

25
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,802
No.

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,465
Come on, NicoIe.
Let's go home.

27
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,137
Lyon.

28
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,035
Lyon.

29
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,081
Lyon.

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,479
Lyon!

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,812
Lyon!

32
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,388
Ha ha ha.
Aye, Lyon.

33
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,093
Wonder what's in
the goody sack for you today?

34
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,863
Heh heh.
Let's have a Iook.

35
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,531
There we go.

36
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,473
''Legionnaire
Lyon GauItier.''

37
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,979
Ooh, yes.

38
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,781
- It's very nice.
- No interest, eh?

39
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,114
OK. Back she goes.

40
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,122
Aah!

41
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,225
Aah!

42
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,288
Yeah, GauItier.
That's me.

43
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,337
This one's been out
in the sun too Iong.

44
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,614
She tried to caII me
two weeks ago.

45
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,115
Nobody toId me.

46
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,076
Why?

47
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,351
This is the Foreign
Legion, GauItier,

48
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,858
not CIub Med.

49
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,860
We're taIking about my brother.

50
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,589
He couId be dead by now.

51
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,532
And we couId be at war
with the bIoody wogs tomorrow.

52
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,093
I need your ass here.

53
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,606
Your brother
is not my probIem.

54
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,478
Or yours anymore.

55
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,245
You gave up your famiIy
when you joined the Legion.

56
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,487
I never gave up my famiIy.

57
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,491
Never.

58
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,424
Legionnaire, I don't have time
for this shiesse.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
I need to see my brother.

60
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,267
You need what
I teII you you need.

61
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,675
And right now I think
you need two weeks hard Iabor.

62
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:30,455
You onIy have six months Ieft
in the Legion, GauItier.

63
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,616
Don't make it six years.

64
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,992
You're a reaI asshoIe.

65
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,968
Is there a probIem, sir?

66
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,971
No, no, no, no.
No probIem.

67
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,974
Desert fever.
This is your reaI probIem.

68
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,978
Too many weeks
in the hot sun.

69
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,982
ShaII we try
sweatbox, sir?

70
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,918
Yes,
this might heIp.

71
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,582
Just untiI his
fever breaks.

72
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,074
Cover your head,
Iegionnaire.

73
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,649
Move!

74
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,952
Your beIt.

75
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,922
Come on.

76
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,926
Ugh!

77
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,623
Move!

78
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,632
Your hoteI room
is ready.

79
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,792
OK.

80
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,801
Hyah!

81
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,675
Aah!

82
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,412
Ugh!

83
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,759
Aah!

84
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,803
Aah!

85
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,357
Hyah!

86
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,231
Hyah!

87
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,544
Get me a fucking jeep!

88
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,209
There's no sign
of him, sir.

89
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,581
He'II never make it.

90
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,453
If the wogs don't kiII him,
then the desert wiII.

91
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,852
Just in case, head down to the docks
first thing in the morning.

92
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,125
The ocean is his onIy way
out of the country.

93
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,171
Moustafa, go this way.

94
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,988
Hey!

95
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,687
Get your ass
back down beIow!

96
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,957
Get down to those
boiIer rooms now!

97
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,089
OK.

98
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,996
This ain't no pIeasure cruise.
Move your ass!

99
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,814
The Ietter was
from his sister-in-Iaw.

100
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,654
We are fortunate our inteIIigence
section makes a habit

101
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,160
of recording
return addresses.

102
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,568
We'II contact the Americans

103
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,799
and ask them to keep her
under surveiIIance.

104
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,330
Inspector,
this man is a deserter,

105
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,742
a traitor to France,
and a goddamn terrorist.

106
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,512
Adjutant, aII I can do
is transmit the warrant.

107
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,519
If the Los AngeIes cops
aren't too busy

108
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,953
busting dope deaIers,
gang rapists,

109
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,456
and seriaI kiIIers,

110
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,255
maybe they'II have time
to bring the asshoIe in.

111
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,762
And if they don't,
tough shit.

112
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,968
If they do not,
maybe I can heIp.

113
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,944
You stay off
the top deck.

114
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,379
First Mate's orders.

115
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,051
You were toId not to come up.
Am I right?

116
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,687
Yeah.

117
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,887
And you toId me this ship
was going to Los AngeIes.

118
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,896
What difference
does it make?

119
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,898
You ain't got
no green card.

120
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,399
You ain't got no visa.

121
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,493
You ain't getting off
anywhere, Frenchy,

122
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,131
so get your ass beIow
before somebody reports you,

123
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,370
a deserter,
stowed away on their ship.

124
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,933
You keep stoking my boiIers,

125
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,502
or you'II be breaking rocks
in the hot sun.

126
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,015
Now what's it going to be?

127
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,815
It's going to be simpIe.

128
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,854
Ugh!

129
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,456
Hey, maybe we make a deaI.

130
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,459
You've been
so generous to me.

131
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,459
Huh?

132
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,039
America.

133
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,347
Los AngeIes information.

134
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,554
PIease deposit $2.40.

135
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,563
No, it's my
sister-in-Iaw.

136
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,565
She's waiting for me.

137
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,066
HeIene GauItier.

138
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,864
I don't care if she's
the mayor's sister-in-Iaw.

139
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:42,462
If I don't hear coins,
this conversation's over.

140
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,973
You got it?

141
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:16,966
Hey, come on,
get him!

142
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:26,677
Who you puIIing for,
motherfucker?

143
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,451
KiII that fucker!

144
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,249
Come on, goddamn it!

145
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:46,968
You want another fight?

146
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,973
You sure you don't
want another fight?

147
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,474
You can win.

148
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:59,683
Get your money.
I ain't got aII goddamn day.

149
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,989
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

150
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,718
Shut up, shut up.
Wh's gonna fight the next fight?

151
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,061
Who's going to fight
the next goddamn fight?

152
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:15,496
Do we even have
a next fight?

153
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,500
Do we have a next fight?

154
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:18,500
- Yay!
- Yay!

155
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,503
AII right, aII right.

156
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,505
We got a visitor.
AII right.

157
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,632
- Who might you be, man?
- Lyon.

158
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,370
- What?
- Lyon.

159
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,503
Lyon.

160
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,444
- Lyon?
- Lyon?

161
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:31,845
What the fuck is Lyon?

162
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,444
Lion! The Lion!

163
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,455
AII right, aII right.

164
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,957
Who wants
to take on the Lion?

165
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,893
Who wants
to take on the Lion?

166
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:47,453
Somebody's got
to take on the damn Lion.

167
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:50,432
Hey, there's my man now.

168
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,526
We got a fight now, baby.

169
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:55,367
Yeah, Iet's get ready
for this one.

170
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:57,873
Bets down.
Get your bets down.

171
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:01,909
I got $10.

172
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,914
$10. Which one
do you want?

173
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,858
Ain't nobody going to bet
on the Lion? Thats it!

174
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:17,018
Bets over, bets over.

175
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,790
Bets over, everybody.
Bets over.

176
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:29,371
Hey, my man. Look here.
You sure you want to do this, my man?

177
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,874
I'm the onIy one
betting on you.

178
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,375
Don't Iet me down.

179
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:35,639
This is ours
if you beat this dude.

180
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,942

Hey, wait a minute.
You didn't give me enough.

You're a good fighter,

201
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,494

Goddamn, man, don't be

00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:57,678
Eat it.
It won't hurt you.

Don't ever insuIt

360
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,585
If there's something
RusseII or I can't handIe,

361
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:52,747

Good.

365
00:29:58,395 --> 00:30:00,659
Now, what's this shit

366
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,097
I can have
another fight Iined up

367
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,599

368
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,102
Better money for everybody

369
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,070
but it's up to you, Lyon.

370
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,766
I'm going to Los AngeIes.

371
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,900
What the fuck

372
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:18,645
AII right. Can you at Ieast

373
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:20,808
- No.
- Do us a favor.

374
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,852
TaIk it over

375
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,013
My manager?

376
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:28,914
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:33,053
My man wants to go to L.A. What
he's got goin' there is his business.

378
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,530
We'II be back

379
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,499
You understand?
Right, my man?

380
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,865
Let me teII you aII
something.

381
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:42,496
What I did tonight
I did for my famiIy,

382
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:44,938
not for you...

383
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,441
not for me.

384
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,000
You made a totaI...

385
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:51,275
of $5,000.

386
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,009
That's a pretty
substantiaI amount

387
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,516
for a one-night stand.

388
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,848
Where eIse wiII you
make that much money?

389
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,013
That's my business,
not yours.

390
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,522
Stop the car.

391
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,558
What if we arrange
a fight in CaIifornia?

392
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,719
We do have a circuit
out there, too.

393
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:07,355
Arrange it
for somebody eIse...

394
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,864
and stop the car.

395
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,777
That 5,000 won't go
as far as he thinks.

396
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,871
My private number...

397
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,382
in case
he changes his mind.

398
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,817
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

399
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,319
Hey. Hey, man.

400
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:33,822
Get up off the acceIeration,

401
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,825
You know how far that damn airport
is from here?

402
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:40,158
Hey, come on, man.
It's just me and you now.

403
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,664
I Ieft them other
jive turkeys way behind.

404
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,325
AII right.
I can dig it.

405
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:45,993
My brother

406
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,299
so I'II Ieave his ass
in the street.

407
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,340
Go ahead

408
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:54,002
We'II see how far your ass

409
00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:55,874
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

410
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,208
Jive motherfucker.

411
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:00,783
Tonight
I fought for you.

412
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,843
- You didn't make enough money?
- Wait a minute, man. Shh.

413
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,218
Huh?
You want some more?

414
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,723
Don't be taIking about money
around here, man.

415
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,726
These peopIe hear

416
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:13,228
we won't make it
to that damn corner.

417
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:16,231
Just put your money
back in your pocket.

418
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:21,470
Why don't we get a cab
out of here now?

420
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:22,698
Come on.

421
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,037
Hey, Iookit there.
There it is.

00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:27,474
There's a teIephone.
That's what we need.

423
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:28,511
Yeah.

424
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:31,308
Listen to me.

425
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:33,315
I'm a survivor.
Come on, man.

OK.

472
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:00,089
Ah, shit.

473
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:03,655
$5,000 goes a Iong way
in the Iand of sunshine.

474
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:31,960
It finaIIy happened
Iate Iast week.

475
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:35,293
With the extent
of his injuries,

476
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:39,301
honestIy, I don't know how
he heId on as Iong as he did.

477
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:44,472
It's because I toId him

478
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,805
I'd aIways
be there for him.

479
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:50,478
I'm truIy sorry.

480
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,820
The guys that did this to him--
did they catch them?

481
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:07,926
Mr. GauItier...

482
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,090
he's gone,

483
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:12,601
and nothing we can do
wiII bring him back.

484
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,930
Doc, my question is,

485
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,673
did they catch them?

486
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,935
Yes, Mr. GauItier.

487

488
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:31,443

490
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,990

491
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:38,618
He Ieft them with a stack
of unpaid medicaI biIIs

492
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:41,788
and not too much
of anything eIse.

493
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:44,923
Now, I can give you

Can you show me?

533
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:33,666
My mommy toId me not

534
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,164
Your mommy, huh?

535
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,832
She's right.

Now you're not
a stranger anymore?

539
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,455
I'm not a stranger
when your mommy says I'm not a stranger.

540
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:01,051
Just give me
tiII Friday, OK?

541
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:03,495

543
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:07,760

Cash.

545
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:10,304
OK, if you don't,

547
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:17,269
I don't think this wouId be
a good time to ask my mommy.

548

552
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:48,536
NicoIe, go inside
and draw with your crayons.

553
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,100
Just for a minute,
honey.

554
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:57,445
So you finaIIy decided
to grace us with your presence.

555
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:01,913
HeIene, it was impossibIe
for me to go.

556
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,891
I put myseIf in a Iot
of troubIe to get here.

557
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,520
I've got news for you.
It wasn't worth it. You're too Iate.

558
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,063
HeIene, I tried.
I'm sorry.

559
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:11,462
I tried.

560
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:18,404
The onIy thing that he wanted
was just to see your face again.

561
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:23,471
- Maybe we shouId go inside.
- No! I don't want you inside.

562
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:26,673
I don't want you anywhere near me
or my daughter again.

563
00:41:26,748 --> 00:41:29,148
You started her father
on that shit.

564
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:32,550
- That's not true.
- Oh, yeah?

565
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,918
He took that shipment
to Amsterdam for you.

566
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,855
That's what I toId the cop.

567
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,322
He was a smart kid.
I didn't want him in jaiI.

568
00:41:41,396 --> 00:41:44,388
- He had a future. You were pregnant.
- Oh, spare me the detaiIs.

569
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:48,926
He might have been better off if you
had kept quiet and Iet him go to jaiI.

570
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:51,996
He was not enough
strong to be in jaiI.

571
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:53,768
It wouId have kiIIed him.

572
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:57,403
The streets that you Ieft him on
are what kiIIed him.

573
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,811
No, HeIene.

574

Don't you get it? I don't want
anything from you ever again!

585
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:42,723
Now get out of here

Them guys with
white hats, right?

594
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:22,463
I thought the Foreign Legion
was something you see on oId movies.

Anything eIse?

709
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:51,824
Yes.
I have to move out of here.

710
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:02,094
Do I have the right to ask
what brought these sudden changes on?

711
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:06,367
I'm going to fight for you.
I have to Iive Iike a fighter.

712
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,103
This pIace is too nice,
too soft, too easy.

Don't faII on them

that phony insurance check.
