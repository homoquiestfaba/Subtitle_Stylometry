00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,457
 <i>
I'm writing a story</i> <i>
for the</i> Chronicle

2
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,154
<i>about marriage in the '90s.</i>

3
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,026
<i>I interviewed your friend,</i>

4
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,811
<i>and she thought you might have
some valuable insights.</i>

5
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,435
Um...

6
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,568
This story is different

7
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:28,180
than what you might
have heard before.

8
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,834
Every story is a
little bit different.

9
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,706
Yeah, I imagine, but...

10
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,013
I think mine really is.

11
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,986
"He looked at her
with an inquisitive smile,

12
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,771
"and she knew they would meet
that night on the golf course,

13
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:24,209
"'on the links,'
as they called it in England.

14
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,124
"They might meet
on the seventh hole

15
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:27,430
"or maybe on the 14th,

16
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,432
for those had the sand traps."

17
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,999
Oh, God.

18
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,179
Hello? Hi.

19
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:38,789
Where are you?

20
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:41,923
Hmm. Reading.

21
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,664
<i>Links of Love.</i>

22
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,622
When are you coming home?

23
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,929
Three weeks?

24
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,540
You never stay that long.

25
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:54,762
Well, how come
you're going to stay so long?

26
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,721
Well, is it a job or a vacation?

27
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,638
Are you taking
an assistant with you?

28
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,161
Are you taking an--

29
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,295
That blonde assistant
that I met last--

30
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,992
I was just asking.

31
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,081
Fine.

32
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,917
We did over 1500 on Saturday.

33
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,793
You miss me?

34
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,490
"Just a little."

35
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,537
At least you're honest.

36
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,756
A lot.

37
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,890
I do.

38
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:38,283
Thanks for your note.

39
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,721
Yes, I love your notes.

40
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,464
Well, talk to me a little.

41
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,814
You don't have to go.

42
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,167
All right.

43
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,345
All right.

44
00:07:58,303 --> 00:07:59,522
Talk to you later.

45
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,575
"He just kept surprising her,

46
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,315
"and that was
what she loved about him.

47
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,665
"It didn't matter which hole,

48
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,059
as long
as they could be together."

49
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:04,935
Do...

50
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,155
Do you want a bite?

51
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,984
Sure. Yeah.

52
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,813
Anything to help you
finish it.

53
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,251
Mmm.

54
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,255
Um...

55
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,562
excuse me. Where
are you from?

56
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:26,174
Oh. I'm British. I'm Welsh.

57
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,871
Oh, that. Yeah.
I'm from Wales.

58
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:30,091
Ah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

59
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,313
Where are you from?

60
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,793
Me?

61
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,578
Yeah.

62
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,492
Well, I'm from here.

63
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,538
You're from--?
Well... Well, no.

64
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:45,628
I mean, I'm American.

65
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:49,023
Why? Do I have an accent?

66
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,852
No.

67
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,898
No.

68
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,078

Well, what made you think
that you had an accent?

69
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,689
I don't know. I was so nervous,

70
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:05,039
I don't know what
came out of my mouth.

71
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:07,171
Is this
the kind of thing

72
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,696
that you want to hear?
Yeah, of course.

73
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,351
Um, so should I just continue
telling you how it started,

74
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,093
or should I...

75
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,660
Just pick it up
wherever you like.

76
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,836
Okay.

77
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,683
So how were those?

78
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,990
These are a little loose,
actually.

79
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,949
Okay.

80
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,516
Why don't you try these?

81
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,431
Okay.

82
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,737
So where are you going?

83
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,783
I'm being interviewed
by a journalist.

84
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,395
What for?

85
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:00,268
You don't want to know.
Trust me.

86
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,661
You wouldn't
have told me

87
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,706
if you didn't
want me to know.

88
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,229
Hey, these
are cute, man.

89
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:10,234
What are you being
interviewed about?

90
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,977
About my affair.

91
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,678
What kind of affair?

92
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,592
An affair affair.

93
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:21,942
You know...

94
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,770
an affair.

95
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,298
Say something.

96
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:31,995
Who's the guy?

97
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,215
What was your name again?

98
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,347
Paulie.

99
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,393
You make a great cup of coffee,
Paulie.

100
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,655
Thank you.

101
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,265
There's some of me in every cup.

102
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:45,792
Why? Do you spit in it?

103
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,578
No, but sometimes I'd like to.

104
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,800
I think you did.

105
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,497
Oh, no. You caught me.

106
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,194
Mm-hmm.

107
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,242
How can I make it up to you?

108
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,640
Nah.

109
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,381
Yes.

110
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:11,643
You want that?

111
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,689
Mm-hmm.

112
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,177
Bigger.

113
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:24,831
- Bigger?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,050
<i>So I went back there</i> <i>
a couple of times</i>

115
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,878
<i>and I just kind of ignored him,</i>

116
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,011
<i>so he wouldn't think</i> <i>
I was coming to see him,</i>

117
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,578
which, of course, I was,

118
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,102
and at some point,

119
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,364
I don't remember exactly,

120
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:39,019
but, um, he asked me out,

121
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,890
and I said
I'm married,

122
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,284
and he says,
"I know you are,"

123
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,764
just like that,

124
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:48,811
and I thought, my God,
this guy is so cheeky,

125
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,596
so I said, um, yes.

126
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,382
I have no idea why. I just...

127
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,253
I don't-- I just did,

128
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,343
and he leads me
to this booth in the back,

129
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:02,346
and he starts asking me
all these questions.

130
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,307
Then he starts making
all these judgments about me.

131
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,918
Like saying that I am,
by nature, unfaithful.

132
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,180
Nice.

133
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,616
What did you say?

134
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,444
Nothing.

135
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,664
I threw my drink at him.

136
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,362
Good for you.

137
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,496
Yeah, well,
then he threw his at me.

138
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,585
Yeah.

139
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,544
I went back to the bathroom
to towel off,

140
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:30,722
and he follows me back
to apologize.

141
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,724
He did?

142
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,031
Yes, he did,

143
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,468
and, well,
I won't go into details,

144
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:41,081
but, um, one thing
led to another, and, uh...

145
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,780
In the ladies' room?

146
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,477
We locked the door.

147
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,870
Come on.

148
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,785
I know.

149
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,831
Well, you asked me.

150
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,967
Didn't you feel
really guilty or--?

151
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,316
No.

152
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,492
Why should I
feel guilty?

153
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,972
You know, if anything,

154
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:04,365
it's helping my marriage.

155
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:07,150
I'm serious.

156
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,065
What about you?

157
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,676
Haven't you ever
thought about it?

158
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh.

159
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,245
No, I...

160
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,205
I could never
handle that.

161
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,991
You'd be surprised.

162
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,561
Um, excuse me.

163
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:27,997
Sugar. You wanted.

164
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,043
Thank you.
You're welcome.

165
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,096
And?

166
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,021
God!

167
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,675
She doesn't know
how to make it right.

168
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,461
Listen to you.
Mr. Coffee.

169
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,420
Listen, she doesn't know
how to make it right.

170
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,335
You know how to make it right.
She doesn't.

171
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,163
What did I do wrong?

172
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,730
The key to making
good espresso is tamping.

173
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,080
You have to tamp.

174
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,256
I tamped.

175
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,432
Yes, but you didn't
tamp correctly.

176
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,086
I didn't tamp correctly?

177
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,697
See, if you don't
tamp the grounds right,

178
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,525
pack them down a little bit,

179
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:18,787
then the water will just go

180
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,094
drip, drip, drip, right through,

181
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,878
and it tastes runny.

182
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,967
You know, this coffee
just tastes runny.

183
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,274
Oh, God,
I've got to pee.

184
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,673
Every cup of coffee
is a work of art,

185
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,067
especially the way I make it.

186
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:43,333
What are you doing?

187
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,945
What do you
want me to do?

188
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,598
Behave.

189
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:50,558
I am. I'm behaving.

190
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,263
You let him kiss you?</i>

191
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:03,745
Well, it wasn't a real kiss.

192
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,922
Did you tell
your friend?

193
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,706
No, I was too embarrassed.

194
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,317
I think you should
tell her.

195
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,929
I know, but what difference
would it make?

196
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,762
I don't suppose you're going
to tell your husband either,

197
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,156
are you?

198
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,593
I already did.

199
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,422
Oh, yeah.

200
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,562
Um...

201
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,788
What? What?

202
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,704
I bought you a present.

203
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,974
Wow. The Grays.

204
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,410
Do you like it?

205
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,109
Oh, yes.

206
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,241
I really do.

207
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,547
Oh.

208
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,164
You try it on.

209
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:19,516
Yeah.

210
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,518
Do you like it?

211
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,651
I really do.

212
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:26,088
Thank you.

213
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,491
That's okay.

214
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:26,540
I'll drink some coffee
and I'll work.

215
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:28,585
That's okay.

216
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,631
I'll just work.

217
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,676
That's all right.

218
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,983
I'll just work.

219
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,507
That's okay.

220
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,466
I've got a lot of work to do.

221
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,120
That's all right.

222
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,904
I'll just work.

223
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,807
So how do those feel?

224
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,679
Oh, good.

225
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,290
Well, why don't you

226
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,857
try and walk
around the store?

227
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,555
Get the feel of them
a little bit.

228
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,687
That might
help you decide.

229
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,298

Oh, I don't know.

230
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:13,951
I'm not sure.

231
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,866
Well, why don't you
look around

232
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,565
and maybe something else
will grab you.

233
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,360
Can I help you?

234
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,231
Uh, yeah.

235
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:19,147
I was just looking.

236
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,498
For-- For some shoes.

237
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,239
Yeah?

238
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,156
Alrighty,

239
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,114
and, uh, what size do you wear?

240
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,986
I'm, um...

241
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,031
I'm pretty big.

242
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,340
Pretty big.

243
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:41,038
Yeah.

244
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:43,127
I'd say about a 10 and a half.

245
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,173
Oh.

246
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,349
Maybe we should measure.

247
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,549
What are you
doing here?

248
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,334
You didn't come
to the park today.

249
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:18,337
It's raining.
It didn't stop me.

250
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:21,165
How did you find me?

251
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,692
I couldn't go two days
without seeing you.

252
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,829
Do you have these
in my size?

253
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,918
Um...

254
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,703
I'll go check.

255
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:39,053
Thank you.

256
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,490
You're a 10.

257
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,194
Whew.

258
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,877
You're not supposed
to be in here.

259
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,053
Oh.

260
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:26,100
I thought
you might need some help.

261
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,498
I can't seem to find
anything today.

262
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:05,139
Everything but what I need.

263
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:08,359
I'm sure it's
up here somewhere.

264
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:36,475
I'm scared I'll fall.

265
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,173
No, you won't.

266
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:42,132
I've got you.

267
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:44,091
I've got you.

268
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,048
You may find this
hard to believe,

269
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:33,575
but, um, nothing like that
has ever happened to me.

270
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,971
I know.

271
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,280
I mean,

272
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,848
I like to think of myself
as a spontaneous person,

273
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,068
but I'm really not.

274
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm not either.

275
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:52,507
I'm really not.

276
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:00,254
What I'm trying
to say is...

277
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:01,951
I mean, what I really
want you to know

278
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,431
is that...

279
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:07,348
I've never...

280
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,093
Been unfaithful.

281
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,443
Yeah.

282
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,401
I know.

283
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:23,930
So.

284
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:26,497
So.

285
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,238
Um...

286
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,284
Let me see, we could...

287
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,503
We could just meet here.

288
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:34,244
That's all.

289
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:35,724
Just meet here.

290
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,640
No, that's not...
That's not...

291
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,294
What?

292
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,387
My husband
is only going to be away

293
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,346
for three weeks, so it...

294
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,612
It's not like
we would have that much...

295
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:57,354
time to be together anyway.

296
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,496
Um...

297
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,244
I should get back
to the shop.

298
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,036
Um...

299
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,822
I'm going to be home tonight
if you want to call.

300
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,301
I mean, I don't have any plans

301
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:34,348
or anything
like that.

302
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,092
Okay, I will.

303
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,269
You'll call?

304
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,140
Yeah.

305
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,099
I'll call you.

306
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,017
Okay.

307
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,932
Okay.

308
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:01,505
<i>I was Nina's lover.</i>

309
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,595
<i>It's a funny word, that,</i> <i>
don't you think?</i>

310
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,206
<i>"Lover."</i>

311
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,121
<i>Because most people</i> <i>
who have a lover</i>

312
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,558
<i>don't really love them.</i>

313
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,038
<i>It isn't love</i> <i>
they're looking for.</i>

314
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,302
At least,
I don't think so.

315
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,608
You don't think
Nina was looking for love?

316
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:25,268
I think Nina was looking for...

317
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,836
an experience.

318
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,539
Hello? <i>
Nina?</i>

319
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,064
<i>Hi. Where are you?</i>

320
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,762
I'm in my studio.

321
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:44,026
Well, sometimes I sleep here,
you know?

322
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,420
You should go home. It's late.

323
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:49,075
Your wife's probably wondering
where you are.

324
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,470
You want me to go?

325
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,908
No, not really.

326
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,474
<i>Well, maybe</i> <i>
I should go.</i>

327
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,259
No, no, um...

328
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,044
talk to me a little,
then you can go.

329
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,655
<i>All right.</i>

330
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:11,401
So, um,
what should we talk about?

331
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,144
Um...

332
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,625
<i>I don't know.</i>

333
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,974
Where are you?

334
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:26,025
I'm in my bedroom,
laying in my bed.

335
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,027
<i>There's a light on</i> <i>
in my room.</i>

336
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,029
<i>It's the only light on</i> <i>
in the whole apartment.</i>

337
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,033
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

338
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,383
A nightgown.

339
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,515
<i>What color?</i>

340
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:39,952
Black.

341
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,344
Silk.

342
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:44,565
A black, silk nightgown?

343
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,872
Yeah, why? You don't believe me?

344
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,788
<i>No.</i>
Why not?

345
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:53,226
You just don't seem like
the black, silk nightgown type.

346
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,531
Oh, really?

347
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,577
What type do I seem?

348
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,885
<i>Tell me.</i>

349
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,757
If you're alone... <i>
Hmm.</i>

350
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,367
I mean, if you're
going to bed alone...

351
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,021
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

352
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:09,285
then, um, I think
you're wearing sweatpants.

353
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:14,073
What color? <i>
White.</i>

354
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,422
Gray.

355
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:16,945
<i>Well, gray,</i> <i>
all right,</i>

356
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,338
<i>but I was right,</i> <i>
wasn't I?</i>

357
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,514
How did you know? <i>
I just guessed.</i>

358
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,298
What are you wearing?

359
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,083
<i>Hmm... Nothing.</i>

360
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,867
<i>I'm absolutely naked.</i>

361
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,216
Oh.

362
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,393
I don't believe you. <i>
Why not?</i>

363
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:31,612
I just don't.

364
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,396
Look, ask Phyllis, okay?

365
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,920
My assistant.

366
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:37,009
Phyllis, what am I wearing?

367
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:38,445
Nothing.

368
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:39,663
You see?

369
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,711
Let me talk to Phyllis.

370
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,452
<i>No, she can't come</i> <i>
to the phone now.</i>

371
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,062
Why not?

372
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,282
<i>She's putting</i> <i>
her clothes on.</i>

373
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:52,198
Oh, no wonder
why you're there so late.

374
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:53,982
<i>Yeah, well, Phyllis</i> <i>
has discovered,</i>

375
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,897
<i>you know,</i> <i>
that she works best</i>

376
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,594
when she's in her birthday suit.

377
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,901
<i>You know,</i> <i>
that's the name of a band.</i>

378
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,990
What is? <i>
The Birthday Suits.</i>

379
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,210
<i>I saw them once at</i> <i>
the Paradise Lounge.</i>

380
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,952
Were they really
in their birthday suits?

381
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,042
Well, they had plungers
over their...

382
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:11,652
private parts,
but other than that,

383
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:13,262
they were
in their birthday suits.

384
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,526
<i>The lead singer</i> <i>
had such a fine ass.</i>

385
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,832
Oh, yeah?

386
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:20,313
What was his singing like?

387
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,880
<i>Um...</i>

388
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,620
I don't remember.

389
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:27,059
<i>But you do remember</i> <i>
that he had a fine ass.</i>

390
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:30,453
I have a selective memory.

391
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:33,804
Well, are you
going to remember me...

392
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:37,547
when this is over?

393
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,724
<i>Depends on</i> <i>
what you do.</i>

394
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,556
Mm-hmm, yeah, I do remember.

395
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,689
Mm-hmm.

396
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,169
Right, the size seven ones

397
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,606
that you were trying on
the other day.

398
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,565
Right, in the brown.

399
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,263
Yeah.

400
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:59,352
Well, I think Thursday.

401
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,223
We could--
I'm sure we could.

402
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,312
Yeah, well, why don't you
give me a call then?

403
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:06,011
Yes, okay, thank you
so much.

404
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,708
Okay. Bye-bye.

405
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,580
Hi.
Hi.

406
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,756
You're not going home
for any reason today, are you?

407
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,541
No, I'm swamped. Why?

408
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,935
Do you think I can borrow your
apartment for a couple hours?

409
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,849
For...?

410
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,851
Oh, man!

411
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,418
Why don't you go
to his place?

412
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:25,900
He lives
with his parents.

413
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,250
I know, I know.
Stop.

414
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:30,513
Oh...
I know.

415
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,911
Wait, why don't you
go to a hotel?

416
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:39,566
A hotel? Please.
Too impersonal.

417
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,002
Impersonal?

418
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,265
Yes. Come on.

419
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,701
You've been busy
today?

420
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,703
Well, we were really quiet
this morning,

421
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:49,489
then all of a sudden,
got really busy.

422
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:50,751
Thank you.

423
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,448
You owe me.
I know.

424
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,016
And, um, you know, don't
go in my bedroom.

425
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,278
I won't.

426
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:57,627
And could you...

427
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,368
not touch anything?

428
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,892
I won't. I promise.

429
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,025
Thank you.
Thank you.

430
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:09,770

Paulie,

431
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,685
we're not supposed
to touch anything.

432
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:02,431
Mmm.

433
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,748
Why am I
standing here?

434
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:17,664
Just a second.

435
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,585
Take this foot...

436
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:27,717
Mm-hmm.
and move it this way.

437
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,198
One...
and take that foot

438
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:32,374
and move it
to the side. Two...

439
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,724
and bring this one
over here. Great. Okay.

440
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:38,641
Now take this one
and move it that way.

441
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,556
Back.

442
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,909
One, two, three.

443
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,520
One, two, three.

444
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:48,782
One, two, three.

445
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,479
One, two, three.

446
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,786
It also has, like, a down
and then an up, up.

447
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,483
Down, up, up.

448
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,790
Down, up, up. Down, up, up.

449
00:34:56,964 --> 00:35:00,272
Right, left, right.

450
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:01,664
One, two, three.

451
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,189
One, two, three.

452
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,234
One, two, three.

453
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:07,801
One, two, three.

454
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,150
That's great.

455
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:12,501
That's perfect.

456
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,682
Don't worry
about the people.

457
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,249
Yeah, well,
it's embarrassing.

458
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:24,078
I always wanted to
go ballroom dancing.

459
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:25,601
Oh, yeah?

460
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:26,994
Uh-huh.

461
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,561
Go with your husband.

462
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:31,172
No. No. I want to go
with you.

463
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,565
Why do you want
to go with me?

464
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,220
I'm clumsy,
I stand on your feet...

465
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:36,656
No, you're great.
It'll be fun.

466
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,136
We'll get
all dressed up.

467
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,615
Yeah, and then go
dancing in circles.

468
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,878
It's elegant.
It's insane.

469
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:43,402
Oh, fine.

470
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,839
I'll just find
another lover.

471
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,319
Yeah, someone
in his 80s?

472
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:48,972
Oh, come on.
Don't be like that.

473
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,236
Like what?
Just say maybe. Come on.

474
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,498
Just say
maybe you'll do it.

475
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:53,760
No, I don't
think I can.

476
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,196
Maybe you might
take me. Please?

477
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,893
All right. Maybe.

478
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,069
Thank you. When?

479
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,376
I only said maybe.

480
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,865
Ouch!
Oh!

481
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:30,057
The beginning
is exciting.

482
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,320
I was...

483
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:37,891
I was standing there,
cooking dinner for us,

484
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:42,852
and I just thought,
"God, I love this."

485
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:48,162
<i>I just really</i> <i>
liked the idea of</i>

486
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,817
<i>making dinner for my lover.</i>

487
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:54,821
<i>And it wasn't, you know,</i>

488
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,910
<i>a meal that I wouldn't make</i> <i>
any other time.</i>

489
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:58,433
<i>I mean,</i> <i>
it wasn't anything special.</i>

490
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,262
<i>It was just some salmon, but...</i>

491
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:03,873
<i>But suddenly I had some...</i>

492
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,702
<i>special purpose.</i>

493
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,098
And at that moment,

494
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,406
I understood
why people have lovers,

495
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,104
because it makes
the everyday things

496
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:21,151
all of a sudden seem sort of...

497
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,719
magical.

498
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,173
You can see the bridge
so clear tonight.

499
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:45,915
Come here.

500
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:49,832
No, I can see it
fine from here, thanks.

501
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,534
You don't like heights.

502
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,753
I love heights.

503
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:00,103
I just don't like falling.

504
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,627
Well, I'm not going to push you.

505
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:04,151
I haven't even finished
my glass of wine yet.

506
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:09,678
You know
why I don't like heights?

507
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:13,856
Because I'm frightened
I might jump.

508
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,337
Why would you jump?

509
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:19,558
Well, I could get
some self-destructive impulse,

510
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:20,863
and...

511
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:28,306
Come here.

512
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:31,483
What?

513
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,573
Come here and
give me a kiss.

514
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,575
I've got a better idea.

515
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,620
Why don't you come here?

516
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:39,969
No.

517
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:42,581
You come here
and give me a kiss.

518
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,762
All right.

519
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,726
Come on.

520
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,486
Another one.

521
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,010
Another one, huh?

522
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,448
Come on.

523
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,792
Whew.

524
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,710
 <i>
Where are</i> <i>
you taking me?</i>

525
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:10,669
<i>
I thought</i> <i>
you liked surprises.</i>

526
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,453
<i>I do,</i>

527
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:15,543
<i>but I don't like them</i> <i>
to be too surprising.</i>

528
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:18,241
<i>I mean, what if I don't bring</i> <i>
a bathing suit?</i>

529
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,852
<i>Can I still come?</i> <i>
No.</i>

530
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:22,202
<i>No, you need</i> <i>
a bathing suit,</i>

531
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,683
<i>and maybe some</i> <i>
sun block too.</i>

532
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,772
I'm fat.

533
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,172
Better, better.

534
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:39,480
Soft, comfortable.

535
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:49,969
The stomach's not bad.

536
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,980
Um, where are we going?

537
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:02,547
Barbados.
Oh, come on.

538
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,113
We're not really
going to Barbados.

539
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,334
I mean it. Barbados.

540
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:11,251
Oh.

541
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:13,471
Is that fried bananas?

542
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,864
Did you peek?

543
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:17,300
No, I can smell it.

544
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,959
What are you doing?
Nothing.

545
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,352
I'm just, um...

546
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,745
Just getting ready.

547
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,616
You know,
getting dressed.

548
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,883
So...

549
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,537
Did you forget
your swimming costume?

550
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,584
Oh, right.

551
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:41,194
Can we see it?

552
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,849
Not till we get to Barbados.

553
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,025
Uh-huh.

554
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,115
Well...

555
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,031
we're almost there.

556
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,711
Wow.

557
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:21,713
That's great.
You hired a band.

558
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:23,062
Well, they're
friends of mine.

559
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,367
I shot their
album cover,

560
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,370
so, um, they
did me a favor.

561
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,851
I'll say one thing.

562
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:33,115
This affair really got
my imagination going.

563
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:36,292
I can see that.

564
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,556
This is great.
You are great.

565
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,340
I love this.

566
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:36,483
Mmm.

567
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:38,920
I can see why
you like to travel.

568
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,402
Why's that?

569
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,404
Oh, you get to wander
around places

570
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:46,058
you've never been,

571
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:47,712
by yourself.

572
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:49,670
It's so romantic.

573
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,629
Yeah.

574
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:52,891
Do you like
being on your own

575
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,501
when you travel
for your work?

576
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:56,416
No. Yeah.

577
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,765
Sometimes.

578
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:00,202
Hmm.

579
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:02,465
Do you ever
have romances

580
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,293
while you're away?

581
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:12,258
I've had thousands.

582
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:24,444
Would you make me
another drink?

583
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:39,067
Nina wanted to know
everything about me,

584
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,460
and yet, um...

585
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,681
she didn't
want to know.

586
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,554
I was never sure up
until the end

587
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,948
how much
she really knew.

588
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:51,384
Let me tell you
something. I...

589
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:55,910
I think I have
one main weakness.

590
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:58,217
Let me ask you
something.

591
00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:00,175
What is infidelity?

592
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:02,308
I mean,
how would you define it?

593
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:05,050
I don't know.

594
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:07,356
What if you...

595
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,098
think about
another woman

596
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:13,406
while you make love
to your wife?

597
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,755
It seems to me

598
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:17,845
there's a real betrayal there.

599
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,586
Or if you fall in love
with someone else,

600
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,066
if only for a few days,

601
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,765
and never speak a word of it
to anyone?

602
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:27,507
Have you been unfaithful?

603
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,117
Probably.

604
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,598
The funny thing is,
you know,

605
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,121
I was never unfaithful...

606
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,080
until I met my wife.

607
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:36,908

How would you
explain that?

608
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:38,387
It never occurred to me

609
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:40,738
to have two girlfriends
at the same time.

610
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:42,783
Some of my girlfriends,
I later found out,

611
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,263
had two boyfriends,

612
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:45,786
but, um, that wasn't my game.

613
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,354
That's not me. You know?

614
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,748
What's the point?
Uh-huh.

615
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,620
I went along like this
for years,

616
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:58,059
then I met this girl in a cafe.

617
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,887
She was sitting at a table
by herself

618
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:01,759
when I came in.

619
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:04,936
She looked up at me and smiled,
and I just had this feeling.

620
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,546
I just thought, "That's her."

621
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,853
That's who?

622
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:10,855
That's the woman
I'm going to marry.

623
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:13,248
What happened?

624
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,076
We got married.

625
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,469
You just knew?

626
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:18,732
Yep, I just knew.

627
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:20,995
Well, if you just knew,
why would you find it--?

628
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,649
I know the question
you're going to ask,

629
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,129
It's a good question,

630
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:27,828
but, um,
I don't have an answer to it.

631
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,577
Maybe...

632
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:41,189
it's because, well...

633
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,149
now I had the fortune,

634
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,934
or the misfortune,
depending on how you look at it,

635
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:50,720
of meeting a woman
I knew I would never leave.

636
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,595
Is this totally twisted?

637
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:58,380
No. Not totally.

638
00:46:58,554 --> 00:47:00,208
Well, if it makes sense to you,

639
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:03,646
then, um,
maybe you can explain it to me.

640
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,392
Is that better?

641
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,484
No.
Come on.

642
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,791
You said you would.

643
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:20,141
I asked you
not to touch anything.

644
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:21,795
We didn't
touch anything.

645
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:24,015
There was nothing
you didn't touch.

646
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:25,625
Okay, look,
I swear to you, this is it.

647
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:27,366
This is the last time.

648
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:35,374
And you fucked up
my espresso machine.

649
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:36,984
What, it doesn't work?

650
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:38,856
No, now it works.

651
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,162
Sign this.

652
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:43,251
"The last time."

653
00:47:43,425 --> 00:47:45,340
Okay.

654
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:51,346
Don't go in my bedroom.

655
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,522
I won't even
go near it.

656
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:54,915
Thank you.

657
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:58,745
Don't break
the bed, Paulie.

658
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,052
I won't.

659
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:02,967
Here.

660
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:04,229
Actually...

661
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:05,795
I have to wear two again?

662
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,668
Only if you want to have sex.

663
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:11,018
<i>Signorina!</i>

664
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:13,151
You going to be
in there long?

665
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:14,543
Just a minute.

666
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:45,618
Aah!

667
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:50,057
Giorgio Armani! Oh!

668
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,021
 <i>
Hi. Where are you?</i>

669
00:48:57,195 --> 00:48:59,545
<i>I hope you haven't gone</i> <i>
to some far-off place,</i>

670
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,503
<i>or were you afraid</i>

671
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:03,592
<i>I was going to teach</i> <i>
you to waltz again?</i>

672
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,072
<i>Were you?</i>

673
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:07,683
<i>Um, call me, okay?</i>

674
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:10,338
<i>I want to see you.</i>

675
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,340
<i>
No, I haven't left town.</i>

676
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:15,082
<i>I'll be</i> <i>
in the studio all day</i>

677
00:49:15,256 --> 00:49:17,432
<i>if you want</i> <i>
to call me.</i>

678
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:20,218
<i>How come I miss you?</i>

679
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,139
 <i>
Hi again.</i> <i>
You said you would be there.</i>

680
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:29,575
<i>Where are you?</i>

681
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:31,359
<i>I'm home if you</i> <i>
want to call me.</i>

682
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:33,535
<i>How come I think</i> <i>
you're there</i>

683
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:35,537
<i>and you're just not</i> <i>
answering the phone?</i>

684
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,235
<i>Are you there?</i>

685
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:39,628
<i>Okay, I guess</i> <i>
you're not.</i>

686
00:49:39,802 --> 00:49:41,543
<i>Call me if you</i> <i>
get back soon.</i>

687
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:43,154
<i>I think I'm going</i> <i>
to go back to sleep,</i>

688
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:45,199
<i>and you better not</i> <i>
wake me up, okay?</i>

689
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,489
I was here
when you called before,

690
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:18,319
but I, um,
I couldn't come to the phone.

691
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:21,148
Well, I mean,
I could've come to the phone,

692
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,498
<i>but I just sort of</i> <i>
liked listening to you</i>

693
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,022
<i>leaving a message live,</i>

694
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:28,068
<i>as it was happening.</i>

695
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:31,593
<i>Maybe you're doing</i> <i>
the same thing now.</i>

696
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:33,334
<i>Are you?</i>

697
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:36,337
<i>Hello?</i>

698
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:38,513
<i>You know, you should never do</i> <i>
anything I would do.</i>

699
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:41,081
<i>You'll get</i> <i>
into trouble.</i>

700
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:44,128
<i>Anyway, when are we</i> <i>
going to meet?</i>

701
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:46,130
<i>Don't go back</i> <i>
to sleep.</i>

702
00:50:46,304 --> 00:50:47,696
<i>Come over here,</i>

703
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,134
<i>and bring a red scarf.</i>

704
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,049
<i>I'm sure</i> <i>
you've got one.</i>

705
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:55,008
<i>It's probably next to</i> <i>
your black, silk nightgown.</i>

706
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,488
What's the red scarf for?

707
00:50:56,662 --> 00:50:57,837
<i>You were there.</i>

708
00:50:58,011 --> 00:50:59,708
You knew I was.

709
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,623
What's the scarf for?

710
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:03,582
<i>Um, what do you think?</i>

711
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:05,714
I don't know.

712
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:08,935
There's a lot you can do
with a scarf.

713
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,024
Oh, yeah?

714
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:15,202
Well, um, maybe you could
show me some of them.

715
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:16,986
<i>Why does it</i> <i>
have to be red?</i>

716
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,945
Oh, I don't know.

717
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,904
I just like red,
and it, uh...

718
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,428
It suits you.

719
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:25,212
Oh, so I'm going to wear it?

720
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,214
<i>Maybe.</i>

721
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:32,480
I'd love to know
where you get your ideas.

722
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:34,221
I don't have any ideas.

723
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:35,570
You're the one with the ideas.

724
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,009
I've got to go. <i>
Wait.</i>

725
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,402
<i>You'll come over,</i> <i>
right?</i>

726
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:42,838
Maybe.

727
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:44,362
<i>I think you will.</i>

728
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,015
Don't say that,
because then I won't.

729
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,148
<i>All right. I think you won't.</i>

730
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,629
That's better.

731
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,960
I once kissed a guy
for six hours.

732
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:23,270
That's a long time.

733
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:26,795
My face was chapped,
but I loved it.

734
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,770
What are you
looking at?

735
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,425
You.

736
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,991
Why?

737
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,343
Because I want to.

738
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:20,197
Am I a good lover?

739
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,376
Not bad.

740
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,770
And what would make me
a better lover?

741
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,561
If you kissed
my chest.

742
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,396
Now am I
a good lover?

743
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,226
You're getting better.

744
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,098
What else do I have to do?

745
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,753
Use your imagination.

746
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,537
What does that mean?

747
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:11,944
Why do you think

748
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:14,251
people close their eyes
when they kiss?

749
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:22,737
I think it...

750
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:25,958
It heightens
the sensation.

751
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:32,269
You think so?

752
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:36,098
Yeah.

753
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,449
I don't think so.

754
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,670
What do you think?

755
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:45,673
I think

756
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:48,676
so you can pretend
you're with someone else.

757
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:45,733
Nina challenged me.

758
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:49,781
It was like
she was saying, you know

759
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:52,871
"I'm capable
of what you're capable of."

760
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:55,482
So we, uh...

761
00:55:55,656 --> 00:56:00,792
We both kept our eyes open
while we made love.

762
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:05,536
We were both stopping each other
from drifting away.

763
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,845
Like two thieves,
you know?

764
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,543
Staying up all night

765
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:15,197
so the other one
won't run off with the gold.

766
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:31,605
Stay with me.

767
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,914
I'm with you.

768
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:24,223
I loved making love to him.

769
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:29,794
I remember

770
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,709
lying next to him afterwards,
thinking,

771
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:35,364
and this is
going to sound weird,

772
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:40,979
but I wished that I could
share him with someone,

773
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:45,462
because I wanted someone else
to feel what I felt.

774
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:46,767
But, of course,

775
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:48,203
I didn't really
want to share him.

776
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:49,553
I wanted him all to myself.

777
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,468
We just...

778
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:52,860
connected.

779
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:57,474
I felt like I learned
more about my lover

780
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:59,040
in three weeks

781
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:01,042
than I learned about my husband
in three years.

782
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,566
How do you explain that?

783
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,219
It happens.

784
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:06,308
I mean, most of what I learn
about my husband

785
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,702
is from listening to him
have conversations

786
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:10,399
with other people,
like on the phone,

787
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,967
or when we're out
with another couple,

788
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:15,274
but my lover told me things.

789
00:58:15,448 --> 00:58:17,624
He told me things.

790
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:25,632
Well, not everything.

791
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,416
He kept some things from me,

792
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:31,029
and I kept some things
from him too.

793
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:34,075
It's good to
have secrets.

794
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:36,948
Some secrets.

795
00:58:37,122 --> 00:58:39,951
What are your secrets?

796
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,736
What?

797
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,216
If I told you,

798
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,610
they wouldn't be secrets,
would they?

799
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:53,921
Okay. Thank you very much.

800
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:55,183

Thanks.

801
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:56,750
Hi.

802
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:59,318
You can take
your shoes back.

803
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:01,102
Um,
what's wrong with them?

804
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:03,583
I don't want them.
Honey, you wore them.

805
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:05,716
So? What does that mean?

806
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,544
You're not going to
give me my money back?

807
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:10,721
You didn't pay for them.

808
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:12,331
Take them back anyway.

809
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,509
Okay.

810
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:18,163
What happened?

811
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:21,732
Why don't you tell me?

812
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:23,647
Come here.

813
00:59:26,084 --> 00:59:28,521
What?
You're fucking him.

814
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:30,044
Uh! Paulie?

815
00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:31,698
Oh, God, Nina,

816
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:33,700
you're an even better
actress than I am.

817
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,615
You could've
at least told me.

818
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:37,617
No, it never came
anywhere near that.

819
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,358
That's just him
shooting off at the mouth.

820
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:41,186
Hmm.

821
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,796
What are these?

822
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,189
I found them
in his car,

823
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:45,582
and he said
they were yours.

824
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:47,932
In his car,
for chrissakes.

825
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,325
"Why don't you two go to a
motel?" You're such a fucking--

826
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,153
That is not what happened.
He took them.

827
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:54,460
He took them the first time
you guys were at my apartment.

828
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:55,722
I'm supposed
to believe that?

829
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:57,463
Yeah, you're supposed
to believe that.

830
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,421
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Come on!

831
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,728
Look who's talking,
Miss Credibility.

832
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:04,035
At least I'm honest.
Yeah? To who?

833
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:05,558
To myself.
No, honey,

834
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:06,951
least of all
to yourself.

835
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,822
Mm-hmm.
What is that supposed to mean?

836
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:11,651
Forget it.
What is that supposed to mean?

837
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:13,174
Oh, man,
look at you.

838
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:14,785
Okay, look at me.

839
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,961
Look at you!
Your life is a mess.

840
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:18,266
I don't know
what you're doing

841
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,094
with this pseudo-
Italian slime bag,

842
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:22,531
but you're letting your marriage
slip through your hands.

843
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,403
What about you?
What's going on with you?

844
01:00:24,577 --> 01:00:27,101
You never tell me shit anymore,
and I know something's going on,

845
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:28,929
because every time I ask
how you're doing,

846
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,062
you say, "Oh, we're fine.
No, everything's fine."

847
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:34,152
Everything's always fine
with you. So, what is it?

848
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,373
Talk to me.

849
01:00:40,027 --> 01:00:41,855
Nothing.

850
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:45,642
"Nothing." Oh, God. Okay.

851
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:48,035
Everything is fine, right?

852
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:49,907
Great.

853
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:14,453
Yes.

854
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:19,284
Do you think
I'm beautiful?

855
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,329
Yes.

856
01:01:21,503 --> 01:01:22,722
I think you're
beautiful.

857
01:01:22,896 --> 01:01:24,724
Come on, be honest.

858
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,119
No.

859
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:31,035
You're not.

860
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:32,384
I said, "Be honest."

861
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:34,342
I didn't say, "Be candid."

862
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,087
Do you think I'm sexy?

863
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,872
Sometimes.

864
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,787
When?

865
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:46,615
When you don't
try to be.

866
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:57,061
Yes.

867
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:12,163
Where were you
yesterday?

868
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:14,121
I was out
buying a present

869
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:17,298
for a woman I used
to live with.

870
01:02:17,472 --> 01:02:19,083
Does this woman
have a name?

871
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:20,301
Yes, she does,

872
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:22,651
but, um,

873
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,089
I usually call her
"Mother."

874
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,572
Have you ever
been curious...

875
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,139
Um, have you ever...

876
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:34,315
thought about, um,

877
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:35,621
living with
another woman

878
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,188
besides your wife?

879
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:39,886
Is that a suggestion?

880
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,106
Oh, maybe.

881
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,890
Maybe.

882
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:47,981
Would you
want to live

883
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:50,636
with someone other
than your husband?

884
01:02:52,594 --> 01:02:55,249
I might.

885
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,558
And what would
he be like?

886
01:02:59,732 --> 01:03:03,257
Um, I don't know.

887
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:04,781
He would, uh...

888
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:07,653
He would ask me questions
about myself,

889
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,611
and, and,
and I would...

890
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,222
I would talk
about things

891
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:14,007
that I'd never
thought about before.

892
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:26,063
<i>I know the kind of person</i>

893
01:03:26,237 --> 01:03:28,108
Nina would want
to live with.

894
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,198
Well, it's not really
a person at all.

895
01:03:31,372 --> 01:03:32,460
It's more like...

896
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:34,811
an angel, you know?

897
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,203
Someone who
has the patience

898
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:37,988
to sit and listen
for...

899
01:03:38,162 --> 01:03:40,120
hours.

900
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:41,687
Not like me.

901
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:44,342
Uh-huh.

902
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:45,909
I tried to be
like that,

903
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,825
but, uh, there's
a limit, you know?

904
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:50,783
Why is that?

905
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:54,134
I don't know.

906
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:55,919
Maybe it's because the...

907
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:58,008
the better
you get to know someone,

908
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:00,097
the harder it is to listen.

909
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:04,014
I don't know.

910
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:11,543
Uh, so, what happened?

911
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:14,111
Did you leave or did he
throw you out or what?

912
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,939
A little of both.

913
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,202
Oh, baby.

914
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:21,988
I don't know.
It was bound to happen.

915
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:25,731
Maybe I even
wanted it to happen.

916
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:29,169
What do you mean?

917
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:31,606
I was with Paulie
till, like, 1.00 in the morning.

918
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,956
Give me a break.

919
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,045
I went to tell him it was over,
but...

920
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:36,960
you know Paulie.

921
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:39,353
He has this way of making you do
things you don't want to do.

922
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:40,964
Hmm.

923
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,704
I kept thinking,
"Shit, it's getting late.

924
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,619
I have got to get out of here."

925
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:46,534
So I finally got home.

926
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,188
I snuck upstairs,

927
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:49,624
trying to be as quiet
as I could be,

928
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:50,930
and I get into bed.

929
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:53,585
He's not even home, thank God.

930
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,674
I was laying there
for about 10 minutes,

931
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,416
not even,
and the front door opens.

932
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,331
It's him.

933
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:03,203
I've got my eyes closed
so he'll think I'm asleep.

934
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:06,511
He goes into the kitchen
and he, um...

935
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:08,687
I hear the refrigerator
door open,

936
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:10,123
and he takes out
a beer,

937
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,212
and he throws
the metal top

938
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:14,780
in the sink,
like he always does,

939
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:16,608
then he comes
upstairs.

940
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:18,784
I've still got my eyes closed,
of course.

941
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,830
I was even breathing
real steady and regular,

942
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:23,745
like I'd been asleep
for a while.

943
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,748
I know, such an actress.

944
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,228
Then he comes over,

945
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:30,100
and he turns the light on
by the bed.

946
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:33,755
He lays down next to me,
and he says, "Hello."

947
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,975
I didn't answer.

948
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:37,237
I kind of stirred

949
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:38,935
like I'd been
in a deep sleep,

950
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:41,372
and I said, um,
"Oh, hi."

951
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:43,504
He says, "When did
you get home?"

952
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:46,420
"A while ago."

953
01:05:46,594 --> 01:05:49,293
"How did you get home?"

954
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:52,861
I told him I took a cab.

955
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,907
"Oh, really?"

956
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:58,998
Then he takes
a long drink of his beer

957
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:02,045
like he has something to say.

958
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:04,612
"I saw you come home
with another man.

959
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:08,138
Why are you lying to me?"

960
01:06:08,312 --> 01:06:11,271
Well, at that point,
we both just sort of lost it.

961
01:06:11,445 --> 01:06:13,708
I started crying,
he started crying.

962
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:15,928
It was just, um...

963
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:20,367
So I told him
what happened.

964
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,065
I told him...

965
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,328
everything.

966
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:25,764
The next night,

967
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:27,635
I just
didn't come home.

968
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,942
I couldn't face him.

969
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:32,205
And that's when you
spent the night at Nina's?

970
01:06:32,379 --> 01:06:33,859
Uh, yeah.

971
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,383
I just...

972
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:38,864
couldn't face him.

973
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:16,032
I was wondering once

974
01:07:16,206 --> 01:07:18,686
how many days there are
in a lifetime,

975
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,906
and this number
popped into my head.

976
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,603
28,000.

977
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:25,563

How many years is that?

978
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:27,521
Almost 77.

979
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:29,045
Well, maybe
that's how long

980
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:30,568
you're going to live.

981
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:33,962
Oh, God, I hope not.
I don't want to be old.

982
01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:42,536
Should we go to sleep?

983
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,192
Do you want me
to shut up?

984
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:49,065
Uh-huh.

985
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:56,594
Mmm.

986
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:06,038
Good night.

987
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:08,475
Good night.

988
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:12,218
Nina?

989
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:15,352
Hmm?

990
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:19,269
How many days have we
been together?

991
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:22,794
Tomorrow will be 18.

992
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,455
Uh, Nina?

993
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:34,458
Mmm?

994
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:40,159
I love you.

995
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:47,226
Who's she?

996
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,105
Just someone
I worked with.

997
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,020
Is she a model?

998
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,502
No, she's a...

999
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:04,591
She's a makeup artist.

1000
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:08,247
Oh. She looks
like a model.

1001
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,601
What's her name?

1002
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:18,866
Alicia.

1003
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,218
Looks like you guys
were pretty close.

1004
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,222
Yeah.

1005
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,713
Did you sleep with her?

1006
01:10:43,282 --> 01:10:44,501
What?

1007
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:49,027
You heard me.

1008
01:10:53,945 --> 01:10:55,773
What makes you think
I slept with her?

1009
01:10:55,947 --> 01:10:57,775
Well, there was something

1010
01:10:57,949 --> 01:10:59,559
about the way
you were holding each other.

1011
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:01,822
Sort of looks like you did.

1012
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:13,094
You're not going to answer me,
are you?

1013
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:21,364
Are you?

1014
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:35,334
Why are you
so interested?

1015
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:38,990
I'm interested
in everything about you.

1016
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,351
What was
the question?

1017
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,794
Did...

1018
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,187
you...

1019
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:03,536
sleep...

1020
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,364
with...

1021
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:07,366
her?

1022
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:20,771
Yes.

1023
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:30,476
You did?

1024
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,609
Well, that's what
you want me to say, isn't it?

1025
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:35,176
No. Did you?

1026
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,442
What difference
does it make?

1027
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:41,748
Then just say it.

1028
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,538
I slept with her.

1029
01:12:48,712 --> 01:12:50,801
Okay?

1030
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,374
Did she come on to you?

1031
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:07,687
It just sort of happened.

1032
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:10,908
Just happened?

1033
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:20,047
I didn't expect...

1034
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:23,790
What?

1035
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:26,576
Nothing. Nothing.

1036
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,622
You didn't expect...

1037
01:13:31,015 --> 01:13:35,541
I would care?
I knew you would care.

1038
01:13:35,715 --> 01:13:38,022
I didn't expect
you would ask.

1039
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,433
Do you still...

1040
01:13:57,607 --> 01:13:58,999
see her sometimes?

1041
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:07,225
Nina...

1042
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:08,879
why do you want to know this?

1043
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:11,882
Were there
any others?

1044
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:18,323
There were
two others.

1045
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,468
There were?

1046
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:34,600
Yeah.

1047
01:14:40,998 --> 01:14:42,129
Wait.

1048
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,435
Do you have
pictures of them?

1049
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:44,654
I'd love to see
them too.

1050
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:47,352
I don't have
pictures!

1051
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,354
What do you
think I am?

1052
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:56,317
All right.

1053
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:06,502
Okay. Who were the other two?

1054
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,944
One was, um...

1055
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:16,337
a waitress I met in Martinique.

1056
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,904
And the other?

1057
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:21,168
The other one
was a photographer.

1058
01:15:21,342 --> 01:15:24,041
Where did you meet her?

1059
01:15:24,215 --> 01:15:26,696
At a show in London.

1060
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:34,355
Are you still in touch with her?

1061
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,010
No, not very often.

1062
01:15:41,014 --> 01:15:42,146
Do you love her?

1063
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,540
No. Not at all.

1064
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:52,069
What is
this photographer's name?

1065
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:53,940
Her name is Simone.

1066
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:57,553
And the waitress?

1067
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:08,433
I don't remember.

1068
01:16:20,532 --> 01:16:23,622
You don't remember.

1069
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,157
Wait.
Please, don't!

1070
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:38,506
Nina...

1071
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:55,219
And you go, and you go.

1072
01:17:07,797 --> 01:17:09,146
God.

1073
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:15,674
Go. Go. Go.

1074
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:16,980
Yes. Yes.

1075
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:19,678
You go.

1076
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:24,640
These go.

1077
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:39,480
 <i>
I don't get it.</i> <i>
Why were you so hurt?</i>

1078
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:54,887
He's my husband.

1079
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:57,890
He's your husband?

1080
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,774
He's...

1081
01:18:11,948 --> 01:18:14,428
uh...

1082
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,910
my husband.

1083
01:18:41,978 --> 01:18:44,154
Nina?

1084
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:48,419
Nina?

1085
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:40,340
I had told you it was different.

1086
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,215
Sorry.

1087
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:46,912
Um...

1088
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:52,526
what have other people told you?

1089
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,528
Every story is unique.

1090
01:19:54,702 --> 01:19:57,096
Hmm.

1091
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,446
There must be some...

1092
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,927
patterns, or...

1093
01:20:02,101 --> 01:20:03,537
Yeah.

1094
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:05,017
There's basically
two arguments

1095
01:20:05,191 --> 01:20:06,758
about infidelity.

1096
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:08,716
One is that...

1097
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:12,068
you're either born monogamous
or you're not.

1098
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:13,460
And the other...

1099
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:15,898
is that we're all capable.

1100
01:20:16,072 --> 01:20:18,857
Certain conditions in a marriage
provoke it.

1101
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:23,166
What do you think?

1102
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,690
I think it's
a little of both.

1103
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:53,500
So how does
your story end?

1104
01:20:53,674 --> 01:20:56,025
You want to tell me?

1105
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:58,027
Yeah.

1106
01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:02,074
You were in his studio?

1107
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:04,468
Yeah. Um...

1108
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:07,427
I was just in shock.

1109
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:10,039
I didn't go home.
I didn't go to work.

1110
01:21:10,213 --> 01:21:12,345
I went to go visit my sister.

1111
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:14,130
Of course,
I didn't tell her anything.

1112
01:21:14,304 --> 01:21:17,611
I was too embarrassed.

1113
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:20,527
Why was I embarrassed?

1114
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:22,878
How long
were you away?

1115
01:21:23,052 --> 01:21:25,184
Um...

1116
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:27,099
couple of days.

1117
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,145
It was like...

1118
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:32,931
It was like I was floating,

1119
01:21:33,105 --> 01:21:36,282
and then
something snapped.

1120
01:21:36,456 --> 01:21:38,415
And that's when
you called Paulie.

1121
01:21:38,589 --> 01:21:39,720
Uh-huh.

1122
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:51,384
Hi.

1123
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:54,083
You want
some coffee?

1124
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:55,998
Sure.

1125
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:01,264
I've been practicing
my tamping.

1126
01:22:01,438 --> 01:22:03,614
Good.

1127
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:19,804
Oh.

1128
01:22:19,978 --> 01:22:21,240
That is an old
machine, huh?

1129
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:24,200
Yeah.

1130
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:26,028
It looks much better.

1131
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,770
I hope.

1132
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:37,343
Much better.

1133
01:22:37,517 --> 01:22:39,955
Great.

1134
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:47,614
Ahh.

1135
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,098
You look great.

1136
01:22:53,272 --> 01:22:54,578
Thanks.

1137
01:23:05,371 --> 01:23:07,156
Okay.

1138
01:23:09,245 --> 01:23:11,943
Uh, wait. Coffee.

1139
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,508
What?

1140
01:23:55,682 --> 01:23:57,293
I don't know.

1141
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:00,644
Um, Nina...

1142
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:03,647
I, um...

1143
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:09,392
I've got to go.

1144
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:12,438
What?

1145
01:24:12,612 --> 01:24:15,224
I've got to go.

1146
01:24:21,882 --> 01:24:24,885
What?

1147
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,627
You all right?

1148
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:30,239
What?

1149
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:47,212
Are you a faithful husband?

1150
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:49,084
I am.

1151
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,483
And your wife?

1152
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:05,317
Not exactly.

1153
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,365
We've been married
about seven years.

1154
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:11,889
A few years ago...

1155
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:15,284
our love life
became so predictable,

1156
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,155
you could set your watch

1157
01:25:17,329 --> 01:25:19,592
by the time
that we would make love.

1158
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,987
And rather than do
anything about it,

1159
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,336
I allowed her to think

1160
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:27,644
that that's the way
I wanted it.

1161
01:25:27,818 --> 01:25:30,516
So she took a lover.

1162
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:35,739
Took me about six months

1163
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:38,481
to get up the courage
to say anything about it.

1164
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:45,836
I'm sorry.

1165
01:25:48,621 --> 01:25:51,146
So the question is,

1166
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,539
which is
the greater sin?

1167
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:55,585
Taking a lover,

1168
01:25:55,759 --> 01:25:57,326
or putting your lover
in a position

1169
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,892
where they need another?

1170
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:30,375
Hi, Nina. It's me.

1171
01:27:30,549 --> 01:27:31,985
Um...

1172
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,727
have you seen my hat?

1173
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:40,298
Uh, I don't know where it is,
and, um...

1174
01:27:40,472 --> 01:27:43,475
if you've seen it,
maybe you can call,

1175
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:45,651
but you...
you don't have to speak to me.

1176
01:27:45,825 --> 01:27:48,045
Just...

1177
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:50,395
leave a message or something.

1178
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:52,397
All right?

1179
01:27:52,571 --> 01:27:54,225
Bye.

1180
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:50,673
Hi.

1181
01:28:50,847 --> 01:28:52,718
Hi.

1182
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:50,401
So...

1183
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:57,364
do you want to dance?

1184
01:33:09,845 --> 01:33:12,456
You've gotten better.

1185
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:15,720
I practiced.

1186
01:33:15,894 --> 01:33:17,156
You didn't really.

1187
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:20,290
I did. Really.

1188
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:26,644
You like it?

1189
01:33:26,818 --> 01:33:29,212
I'm beginning to.

1190
01:33:35,131 --> 01:33:38,743
Who taught you
to dance so well?

1191
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:41,137
A woman.

1192
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,621
Was she your lover?

1193
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:50,929
Yes, she was.
