90
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
Edelhayn, how is security?

91
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,880

93
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040

... and a young woman.

105
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,440
Are the list of those
who went to Palestine?

106
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,440
Our records show that they actually ...

107
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,080
... are not Jews!

108
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,480
They are Aryan.

109
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320

110
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,360

Are you sure?

113
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,360
I realized that they were
previously studied in Berlin.

114
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,960
Take care not to
any traces.

115
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,280
They must disappear
Krauzenberg when you leave.

116
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
And this is a personal order!

117
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,280
So it will be.

118
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160

136
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
Not after all ...

137
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
We just want to go
home after 2 thousand years.

138
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,840
Now it's time!

139

You must wait here!

150

Do you know how long will it take?

151
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,600
As needed.

Yes, Joseph Krauzenberg.

160
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,080
And a Jew, right?

Wife and the whole family?

162
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,760
Yeah, right.

163
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,520
Today is not good to be Jewish, right?

164
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
Maybe not.

165
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,520
But tomorrow, maybe ...

166
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,120
Tomorrow may be worse.

167
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,000

You donate your
Reichsfuhrer collection?

172

173
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Depends ...

Oh yes, "Europe Plan"!

176
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,560
Yes, "Europe Plan".

177
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,960
You know my Reichsfuhrer

178
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,200
What? You ...

179
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
No matter when, just a fact.

- Do not advise.

185
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,440
Can be very emotional.

186
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,840
But I must see them!

187
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,360

Actually ... yet no one was hurt.

189
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,240
I will fulfill my
Part of the agreement.

190
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,600
Then, what they so worried?

191
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,320
Take this Jew to the east tower.

192
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
Thanks, I will tell you later bye.

193
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,120
Of course, you will
look for coffee that evening.

194
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
Incidentally ...

195
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Let your family to stop whining.

196
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,760
This does not help!

197
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,000
Please listen to me carefully.

198
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
I came to tell you to stay calm.

199
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,800
and do exactly what
Germans have commanded you.

200
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,000
Do not ask questions.

201
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,320
Joseph, they will kill you?

202
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,680
Not if I can help you succeed.

203
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,200
Please, trust me
and you will be safe.

204
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,760
You must be willing to
go at any time.

205
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,840
To travel where?
- Uncle Joseph, where will we go?

206
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,320
Tell us the truth, leave us here.

207
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,080
All I can tell you is ..

208
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,720
Our lives depend on
meeting, which will have to Himmler.

209
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,480
I can not say more, but ...

210
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,480
Please trust me.

211
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I do not know when I'll see you again.

212
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,520
Could be tonight or tomorrow.

213
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,120
But I'll see you again, I promise you!

214
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,520
Trust me.

215
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,080
Do everything in his power
to save us all.

216
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Joseph luck, good luck!

217
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,880
Thank you, Max.

218
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,800
I will do whatever I can.

219
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,520
Take care of them.

220
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,680
Check those emergency f.

221
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,200
I need the information immediately.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
Good morning!

223
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,800
Good morning, Gerhard!
- Good morning, Ingrid!

224
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,120
Sorry for being late!

225
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,920
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

226
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,920
Joseph?
- Yes?

227
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,840
Did you by Himmler?
- No.

228
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,680
No, I was at the police ...

229
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,800
I was at the headquarters of the Gestapo.

230
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,800
At headquarters of the Gestapo?

231
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,440
Yes, it had to be met with Eichmann.

232
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Eichmann?
- Yes!

233
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,200
Where is your family?

234
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,280
They will not come.
- Why?

235
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,600
All are closed there!

236
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,920
At headquarters of the Gestapo?
- Gathered them there like cattle!

237
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,560
But they are not hurt!

238
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,800
Children there?
- They are good!

239
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,440
Go see them!
- No, do not go there.

240
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,360
Not hurt!

241
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
I talked to them, reassured them.

242
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,360
What can we do?
- I give them anything you want!

243
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
You already gave them.
- Maybe not enough.

244
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,240
Now, when we negotiate with Eichmann.

245
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,040
What more can I ask?

246
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,560
I do not know!

247
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,920
But we need
something that is in them ...

248
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,640
Something that is irreplaceable ...

249
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,440
Our family!

250
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Reichsfuhrer is here!

251
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,160
Himmler!

252
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,640
Here! Wonderful!
Why did not you say?

253
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,920
Like you, I execute commands ...

254
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Heil Hitler!

255
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,880
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

256
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,280
Reichsfuhrer very pleasant surprise!

257
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,960
Should discuss the important
Eichmann matter with you.

258
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,880
This is a matter of life or death.

259
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,800
I am at your disposal!

260
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,720
Warning!
Heil Hitler!

261
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,320
It is my pleasure to you
show progress.

262
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,280
Yes, yes, obershturmbanfyurer.

263
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,760
I informed the good work ...

264
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,840
But we need to talk privately.

265
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,440
As you wish.

266
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,040
F. ..
Krauzenberg Know?

267
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,880
In fact, I know everything you need
Krauzenberg for Joseph and his family.

268
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,520
And Hauptsturmfuhrer Dressler tells you to
perception of the Jews in the palace tonight?

269
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
Right at 9:50!

270
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,080
Yeah, you know that his
family is here under guard?

271
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,320
Yeah, I was informed.

272
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,640
Eichmann, probably wondering why
your presence is required.

273
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,480
Curious to me f.

274
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,200
It's like a guarantee of Krauzenberg,
they will be safe.

275
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,800
Safe?
- Can I ask why?

276
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,760
They are mostly Jews.

277
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,920
Yes ... safe.

278
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,360
And tonight will refrain
to use the word "Jew".

279
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,560
or talking about your work.

280
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,320
Instead, you must
to be patient ...

281
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,280
polite ... polite.

282
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,280
I guess this is an order Reichsfuhrer?

283
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,160
Eichmann Yes, this is a commandment.

284
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,080
Maybe a change of
policy towards the Jews?

285
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,880
No, no, no change of policy.

286
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,960
But when I command
to kill Jews

287
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,480
will kill Jews!

288
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,120
And when I command you to protected
Jews, you will be protected Jews!

289
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,320
Understood?

290
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,480
Of course!

291
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,200
The reason for my
personal presence here

292
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,280
is because the industry "Krauzenberg"

293
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,160
controlled and funded
from international banks.

294
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,520
And tonight we will
obtain these industries

295
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,840
in exchange for safe travel
Krauzenberg family to Palestine.

296
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
I understand ...

297
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,240
If you give everything

298
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,160
will allow them to go to Palestine.

299
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
And if I do that?

300
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,280
Go to Auschwitz!

301
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
Vasman?

302
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,840
Small bread.

303
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,640
Did you get the money?

304
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,920
Mr. Krauzenberg, sorry!

305
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,880
More coming soon
than you expected.

306
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,560
Hi Ingrid.
Vasman.

307
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,280
Congratulations Vasman,
I knew it would become a mother!

308
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,080
Yes, thank you sir,
so excited.

309
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,840
This is great.

310
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,960
With your permission, you
to do a lot of things.

311
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,840
They will remove and destroy
everything is germansko.

312
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Who, sir?

313
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,120
Your Reichsfuhrer, Heinrich Himmler.

314
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,800
"Reichsfuhrer Himmler" you say sir?

315
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,800
Vasman Yes, it will be
Our guest tonight.

316
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,400
He sends his personal chef and
assistants to prepare dinner.

317
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,520
You can imagine
How important is tonight.

318
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,120
Of course, sir.

319
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,320
You and Ingrid will serve us at the table

320
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,800
and if necessary will serve Himmler.

321
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,800
Must serve Himmler you, sir?

322
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,480
Yes.

323
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,800
I should warn you,
that nothing ...

324
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,240
Nothing of what I will discuss this
evening should not leave this house.

325
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,360
Mr. Krauzenberg, never
since you serve ...

326
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Yes, yes, I told them that
Both are reliable.

327
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,400
However, only you
suspect that it will reveal that

328
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,680
you see and hear, SS will
taken away and executed immediately.

329
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,280
Certainly sir, perhaps
would be better not to have it here.

330
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
We are scared.
- Too late!

331
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,240
But I gave them copies of your documents
I explained to them that both are Aryan.

332
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,240
So there is nothing to fear.

333
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,360
Exactly!
Thank you sir!

334
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Himmler decided that the meeting
here will be more secluded.

335
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Also wants to see better my
collection of works of art.

336
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,640
Certainly, sir.
To get you all covered?

337
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,880
Yes, yes, I have nothing to hide.

338
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,280
Besides ...

339
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,320
everything will be theirs,
after tonight.

340
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,440
Very generous, sir.
- Yes, Vasman

341
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,800
Very generous.

342
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,360
Better to go ...

343
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,320
Thank Vasman.

344
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,960
Mr. Krauzenberg, go now?

345
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,160
Yes, dear, I have explained
All of your husband.

346
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,520
So I'll see you for dinner, then?

347
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,240
Yes ...
Later, for dinner.

348
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,960
We have orders to be vigilant
this evening. You know why?

349
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,080
No, but my orders are orders.

350
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,560
Anything is better than
they send to the Russian front.

351
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,800
Yes, anything is better than that.

352
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,000
It seems no one returned alive from there.

353
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,000
This is the last place of
I would like to send me.

354
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
There is no way to send me.

355
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,480
I told you that my wife is pregnant?

356
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,720
No, that first child you know?
- Yes.

357
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,640
She says it would be a girl.

358
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Ingrid?

359
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,320
Ingrid?

360
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,920
Here I am.

361
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,920
Tell you who will be coming for dinner?

362
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,720
Himmler and Eichmann!

363
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,960
Himmler and Eichmann?

364
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,640
What do we do?
- Will it poison!

365
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,560
We have a chance to eliminate two of
the biggest monsters of the earth.

366
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,560
Our duty is to kill them!

367
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,040
Are you crazy?

368
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,760
No, Hans, no!

369
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,480
We must do something.
- Have to travel.

370
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,200
We can not ...
- We need to leave immediately!

371
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,280
SS will do security checks.
- What?

372
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,920
Mr. Krauzenberg told me
probably already on their way.

373
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,520
Then let go!
- Please do not panic!

374
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,640
Do not panic!

375
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Remove all equipment, immediately!

376
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,560
We can do it!
- Why?

377
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,160
Mr. and Krauzenberg
his family will be killed!

378
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,520
There will be retaliation, Hans.

379
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,840
Will there be retaliation against innocent people!

380
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
And I will come to us.

381
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Things have changed, we will have a baby!

382
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,640
I know Mr. Krauzenberg said
that probably go tomorrow.

383
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,760
Really? So you say?

384
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,000
Something ...

385
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,960
She said if everything goes according to plan

386
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,120
he and his family will be
free to go to Palestine!

387
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
He said he wants to give us
some money before leaving.

388
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,400
Why not go to Palestine?

389
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,040
We can ask,
Mr Krauzenberg to take us with him.

390
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,840
Impossible!

391
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,200
Why is it impossible?

392
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,320
For we to him
tell the truth, dear.

393
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
And he will undoubtedly bring
two Aryan for Palestine.

394
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
We tell him the truth.

395
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,440
If you tell him

396
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,560
he will explain everything
and we understand.

397
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,680
If you tell him
that work for the Resistance.

398
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,160
If you tell him
that we Jews like him.

399
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,160
Honey ...
Too dangerous!

400
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,840
We can do it!

401
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,640
Are not you ready to try it?
For me, Hans?

402
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,280
Because baby, Hans?
- Not what we have to try.

403
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
We have two cyanide pills.

404
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,480
Or for us, look at me ...

405
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,400
Or Himmler and Eichmann.

406
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,760
That is what we need to solve.

407
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,280
Heil Hitler!

408
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,480
Heil Hitler!

409
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,880
You must be Hans and Ingrid Vasman.

410
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,840
The two Germans
working for the Jews, right?

411
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,160
Yes, sir.
Hans and Ingrid Vasman.

412
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,600
Edelhayn.
Obersturmführer Edelhayn.

413
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,800
Sir, my wife is pregnant
and not feeling well

414
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,680
can you retire?

415
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,000
Later!

416
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,120
First, we will open kitchen closet
To display all of the cook. Right?

417
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,600
Yes, of course.

418
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,200
With your permission, sir.

419
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,160
You ...

420
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,760
Do not look pregnant yet.

421
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,600
Someone else came to
check the security here?

422
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,880
No, you first.

423
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,760
I live here Jews
without being registered?

424
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
No, sir.

425
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,560
I understand that you two are Aryan.

426
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,040
Yes, sir. We are Germans.

427
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,440
Tell me ...

428
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,560
How is it?
To work for Jews?

429
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,320
Relate well with us.

430
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,920
What fun for you!

431
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,600
Probably quite know secrets?

432
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,640
No, sir.

433
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,080
Just doing my job.

434
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,320
And we, too!

435
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,240
Chef in the kitchen closet.

436
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,400
Are you aware of
Our guests tonight?

437
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,040
Yes, sir.

438
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,120
It must remain
strictly confidential.

439
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,680
Of course.

440
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,080
You have our word.

441
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,320
Really?

442
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,400
How generous!

443
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,920
Surely you are familiar with our SS.

444
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,440
And their separation
attention to every detail.

445
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,960
Hitler requires submission of
absolutely all Germans!

446
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,560
You'll see that we are good Aryan,
know how to fulfill orders.

447
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
Yeah.

448
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,040
How interesting!

449
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,600
We are lucky that all
we are such good Aryan!

450
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,120
Right?
- Yes, sir.

451
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,160
Your rooms upstairs are you?

452
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,080
Yes, sir.

453
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,640
Maybe ...

454
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,080
Mrs. Vasman,

455
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,840
you will bring me there?

456
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,520
Of course.

457
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,760
Please let me
clean them before.

458
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,760
Not necessary.

459
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,560
Arrived at our security service.

460
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,720
Mrs. Vasman?

461
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,560
Will thoroughly check each room.

462
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,760
This here first.

463
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
Mrs. Vasman!

464
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,360
Mrs. Vasman!

465
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
Sir?
Excuse me.

466
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,760
Sir. Let me show you the other rooms
which will be used tonight?

467
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
You'll stay down here with my people.

468
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,840
Mrs. Vasman!

469
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,840
Mrs. Vasman!

470
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,240
Mrs. Vasman!

471
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,280
You look beautiful in your bedroom!

472
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,800
Yes, this is our bedroom.

473
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,280
Would you like to search everywhere?

474
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,800
Yes?

475
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,440
Yes. Everywhere.

476
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,400
How old are you, Ingrid?
- At 23, sir.

477
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,280
And I will sleep here?

478
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,080
Tonight?

479
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,280
Yes, I will sleep here tonight.

480
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,680
What we have here?

481
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,440
Is this yours?

482
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,120
Yes.

483
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,640
I always wanted to marry.

484
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,960
I believe you will find
what you want, sir.

485
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,320
Maybe ...

486
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,240
Perhaps I have found him.

487
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,080
This is your first child you will be?

488
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,840
Yes.

489
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,880
Germany, will need many children.

490
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,280
Will need to.

491
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,640
You can be a volunteer and to have a child

492
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,080
with some of the best
our young officers.

493
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,280
Marriage does not disqualify
perfect Aryan woman.

494
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,280
Personally, I ...

495
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,560
contributed to several
Children Program.

496
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,120
Young volunteers from
League of Germanic women.

497
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,920
Some were young widows

498
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,720
and some even married ...

499
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,560
Can ...

500
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,000
I can imagine you with me, Ingrid.

501
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,480
I can imagine you naked.

502
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,880
Come on ...

503
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,760
With that pretty face.

504
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,400
Sir ...

505
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,080
As far as I remember

506
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,200
program is not
compulsory and voluntary.

507
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,160
I'm not going to be a volunteer.

508
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,360
Maybe we can convince them.

509
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,240
I do not think so.

510
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,680
Vasman What do you think?

511
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,400
For this your wife to join
Our program "Lebensborn" (Source of Life)?

512
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,480
Great idea!

513
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,120
Something you would think
in the future, maybe.

514
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,920
Tell me Vasman

515
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,680
I have called them
serve your country?

516
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Yes.

517
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,720
So what?

518
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,400
I was rejected.

519
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,040
I suffer from epilepsy.

520
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,800
Do not they adopted?

521
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,440
You're unfit to serve.

522
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,960
And your wife must have Aryan baby!

523
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,280
This is its debt.

524
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,640
Sir ...

525
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,280
I have a lot of work below!

526
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,120
Ingrid!

527
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,600
Ingrid!

528
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,360
Vasman, stop!

529
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,200
Know that Aryan women
encouraged to procreate

530
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,080
our best men for
to create a superior race.

531
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,600
Right, Vasman?

532
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,440
I know.

533
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,880
Do you approve it?

534
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,760
Will you permit me a beautiful woman
can be attributed to Hitler?

535
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,160
I am ready to do anything about Hitler.

536
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,200
I'll try to withhold
the word, Vasman!

537
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,400
In Reichsfuhrer you?
- No.

538
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,200
Take me to
obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann.

539
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,960
Yes, Obersturmführer.

540
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,240
Some are beautiful.

541
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,320
Too bad they are Jews.

542
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,400
Orders are orders.

543
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,040
Maid in the palace of Krauzenberg.

544
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,160
Ingrid Vasman.

545
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
Do you know anything about it?

546
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,320
Not everything, why?

547
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,240
Tomorrow, when do the job.

548
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,960
I would be grateful ...

549
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,240
If this young woman be raised here

550
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,680
and retained in a separate room for me.

551
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,760
A room ...

552
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,800
which is well Soundproofed.

553
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Is it beautiful?

554
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,400
Yes.

555
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
Very beautiful.

556
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,680
And ariyka.

557
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,600
I do not know why not rethink
talking with Mr. Krauzenberg.

558
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,280
I told you, very dangerous f.

559
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,520
Once you give us some money and maybe we
we can buy transit documents.

560
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,920
Do not panic.

561
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,160
Ms. Krauzenberg!

562
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,360
What a pleasant surprise!

563
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Ingrid.

564
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,560
Mr. Krauzenberg told me you were pregnant.

565
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,720
Yes.
- Congratulations.

566
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,080
Vasman how are you, my little Nazi?

567
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,080
Very good, madam.

568
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,520
Just wanted to see whether
everything is okay for dinner nowadays.

569
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,240
Mr. Krauzenberg was here

570
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,080
and informed us of your guests.
- Just check.

571
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,840
I know that Germans love everything clean.

572
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,800
And so ...

573
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,920
You two are certainly glad

574
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,640
that your Reichsfuhrer
personally came to dinner.

575
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,680
Yes, madam, very exciting.

576
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,320
I am very nervous, ma'am.
Himmler's staff.

577
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,920
Butchers More ...

578
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,800
Staff Reichsfuhrer
will serve meat tonight.

579
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,720
They told me that Himmler loves food

580
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,680
but not Jews, actually ...

581
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,680
Do not know how to drive the Jews suffer.

582
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,360
We know some things, ma'am.

583
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,520
Yes ...
I'm sure you know.

584
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,280
But Himmler and Eichmann were not
Germans threaten you.

585
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,760
No, not for us, ma'am.

586
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,640
Just to know what you're lucky!

587
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,200
Mme.

588
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,000
We want you to come to Palestine.

589
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,400
Palestine?
- Yes.

590
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,840
Impossible.

591
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,320
This is not just a matter of
crossing the street, my dear.

592
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,880
Have to risk life
during the whole trip.

593
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,800
Yes, I understand.
- Is it?

594
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,680
Hope.

595
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,360
Because you are Germans, but I am a Jew.

596
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,880
But above all we are humans.

597
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,160
Well, at least some of us ...

598
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,760
We do not agree with
everything they do.

599
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,000
Hope Ingrid.

600
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,840
But for now ...
To hell!

601
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,520
Send me to the garden.

602
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,240
Gizi Flayshman was that
which proposed the concept

603
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,840
be paid to the Nazis
the lives of Jews.

604
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,400
The so-called "Plan Europe.

605
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,840
But one day her Eichmann arrest
then killed her.

606
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,160
It was my very close friend.

607
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,480
Must have been so brave.

608
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,920
Under this "Plan Europe 'what is the minimum
had to pay to save?

609
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,440
Oh, very!

610
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,880
In what world we live in!

611
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,320
Far as I am interested in
can you keep it.

612
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,200
We heard you tonight and
your family go.

613
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,440
Is this true?

614
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,240
Hope!

615
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,960
But if Himmler did not think
you can earn more money

616
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
which is tonight already
we would be in the gas chambers.

617
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,680
How can you make this?

618
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,400
What we know is that we
to buy our lives,

619
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,480
but not the life of someone
less fortunate than us.

620
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,760
Enough on this topic.

621
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,920
Come, sit less.

622
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,360
I have a gift for you two.

623
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,040
This is something personal to me than money.

624
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,840
So I would like to say
"auf wiedersehen" (goodbye)

625
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,360
my 'Aryan couple.

626
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,320
Here ...

627
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,640
Ingrid ...

628
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,360
This gave it to us
king family of Russia.

629
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,880
It gives you a reason ...

630
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,280
To remember the Jews
miles have been with you.

631
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,840
Beautiful!

632
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,320
Diamonds are very special.

633
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,240
Everyone is very rare yellow,

634
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,000
cost much money.

635
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,200
You can buy a house with one of them.

636
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,400
Vasman behold, my little Nazi!

637
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,600
Thank you!

638
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,520
This course is a separate
what Mr. Krauzenberg

639
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,560
will give birth to.

640
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,600
Ingrid,

641
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,280
cry, cry.

642
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,040
Sorry, Ms. Krauzenberg.

643
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,680
Thank you!

644
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,360
Thank you very much!

645
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,800
I am so grateful for
Your attitude towards me.

646
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,280
I never felt any,

647
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,200
Nazi hostility or

648
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,360
envy you, my dear.

649
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,160
Just something like ...
love you both.

650
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,000
This is my humble
way to say thanks.

651
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,120
If I had children I would like
they are like you.

652
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,320
But, of course, Jews!

653
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,240
I'll see you tonight.

654
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,160
And will keep cold and businesslike,

655
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,640
SS as required to be
between Jews and neevrei, right?

656
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,840
As you wish, ma'am.

657
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,160
And you will be good Aryan

658
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,160
and will help us
be saved by these ...

659
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,800
Madmen!

660
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,640
Of course, you can trust us.

661
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,560
Is everything ready?
- Yes, Reichsfuhrer.

662
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,520
The car is waiting.

663
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,360
Do you have contracts where they are.
- Yes, sir.

664
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,120
Let's go.

665
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,200
Be brave, sweetheart.

666
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,240
Soon everything will be done.

667
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,280
Please do not make any nonsense.

668
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,480
Come on ...

669
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,000
Hans!
- Time f.

670
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,680
Oh my God! Is it dinner
or regrouping of forces?

671
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,520
I will try not to throw up!

672
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,880
At least not on Himmler, please!

673
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,000
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, ma'am.

674
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,280
Good evening, Ingrid.
You look flawless.

675
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,640
Thank you.

676
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,640
To prepare a drink, sir?
- No, thanks.

677
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,560
Yes, please, Ingrid.

678
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,480
A great drink, Ingrid.

679
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,520
Warning!
- Heil Hitler!

680
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,720
Heil Hitler.

681
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,720
Mr. Krauzenberg.
- Mrs Krauzenberg.

682
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,720
It is a pleasure to meet you!

683
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Have a magnificent house.

684
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,080
Had!

685
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,120
Thank you, will
Do you drink or ...

686
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,040
Or dinner?

687
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,800
We are both very busy.

688
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,560
Dinner.

689
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,040
Here.
- No.

690
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,720
After you, ma'am.
Please.

691
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,600
Would you like wine?

692
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,520
Maybe Germany Moselle.

693
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,280
I'm afraid not.

694
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,520
But we have a good French wine.

695
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,800
Tell me Mr. Krauzenberg,

696
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,440
how long it takes to acquire
This vast collection of art?

697
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,800
Much more than
will cost to you.

698
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,200
I never interested
of art before.

699
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,800
But now I find it ...

700
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,440
income statement.

701
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,600
Reichsfuhrer ...

702
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,560
Please do not be affected.

703
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,680
Someone asked, Are you ever wonder why?

704
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,760
Why what?

705
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,520
Why are the camps?

706
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,200
Why Jews?

707
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,520
Maybe you should ask
Eichmann, when the arrive.

708
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,400
He is the specialist.

709
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,080
But I will say this ...

710
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,760
No other country wants you.

711
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,960
Palestine can not even
take all of you!

712
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,080
So there is no alternative.

713
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,120
Furthermore, to kill us?

714
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,120
Not all of you.

715
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,480
Or have forgotten.

716
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,240
Oh no, Reichsfuhrer will never forget.

717
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,840
and you'll never be forgotten.

718
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,120
I would like to propose a toast to Krauzenberg

719
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,320
and to thank them for their generosity.

720
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,000
Krauzenberg!
- Krauzenberg!

721
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,320
Let us move to the library for coffee?

722
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,200
Can I smoke Reichsfuhrer?

723
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,600
Yes, but it prevents me
breathing smoke further.

724
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,560
Mr. Krauzenberg.

725
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,240
Commanded obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann

726
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,840
to come here this evening and
join us for coffee.

727
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,000
Understand.

728
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,120
Not invited him for dinner.

729
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,920
Thank God!

730
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,320
But while he is engaged
with the Jewish problem

731
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,360
it determines that your flight
will be performed tonight.

732
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,600
We transport aircraft
ready, Reichsfuhrer.

733
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,960
Wonderful!

734
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,280
I suggest you to put on warm clothes.

735
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,640
It is cold at this altitude.

736
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,120
How kind of you!

737
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,880
Thank you.

738
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,160
You'll see everything written
as agreed.

739
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,480
Only your missing signatures.

740
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,480
Yes. Yes, of course.

741
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,640
But first you must read the documents.

742
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,040
Here, dear.

743
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,640
In addition to these contracts Reichsfuhrer

744
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,200
What guarantees do we have
that will now sign

745
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,120
and will get on the plane
for Switzerland tomorrow?

746
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,640
Suggests that you do not trust me, madam?

747
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,440
Maybe mistrust
obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann.

748
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,000
Once you sign, it
can we get on a freight train.

749
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,840
For somewhere like Auschwitz or Treblinka.

750
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,920
Impossible!

751
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,960
Even Hitler could not
jumping my commandments.

752
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,760
Sign and stay safe.

753
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,280
You have my word and that is enough.

754
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,040
I propose to begin, right?

755
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,240
Gizi Flayshman ...

756
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,640
It was your personal guarantee

757
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,720
during discussions
"Europe Plan" Reichsfuhrer.

758
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,160
Yes, that was different
situation, Ms. Krauzenberg.

759
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,080
Other than that!
- Rachel, please!

760
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,560
Unfortunately I do not bother,

761
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,080
was a obershturmbanfyurera that ...

762
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,360
Killed her?

763
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,720
Surely he knew that she
was crucial to your plans ...

764
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,880
Live now and pay later!

765
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,920
That was in the past.

766
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,200
Today, you are under my protection.

767
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,400
So you say.

768
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,560
But I am sure
understand my concerns.

769
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,480
Yes.

770
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,840
Therefore commanded to come
obershturmbanfyurera here.

771
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,680
To relax.

772
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,600
Nothing will happen in
the time between your signature

773
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,720
and your departure with your whole family.

774
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,960
Swiss banks will not
begin the process of transfer

775
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,080
while you and your family
you are not safe in Switzerland.

776
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,160
Is not it so, Mr. Krauzenberg?

777
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,400
Yes, we agree, Rachel.

778
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,920
Vasman, please serve coffee.

779
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,480
Yes, sir.

780
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,720
Everything okay?

781
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,680
Contract? Surname?

782
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,320
Yes.

783
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
Mrs. Krauzenberg?

784
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,480
Yes, it seems fine.

785
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,920
Then sign.

786
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,480
Yes.

787
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,480
But I have one last request.

788
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,040
Yes?

789
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,600
I want your word that
all my staff ...

790
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,680
are safe.

791
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,400
You have nearly 3000 employees, right?

792
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,600
Yes.

793
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,640
Some Jews Are?

794
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,960
No.

795
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,800
No longer.

796
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,920
Then you have my word
as i have yours.

797
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,920
They will not be happen.

798
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,360
Thank Reichsfuhrer.

799
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,400
Rachel will sign the documents.

800
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,520
No.

801
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,640
No.

802
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,200
Obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann
arrived, Reichsfuhrer ...

803
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,880
Let us wait outside.

804
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,000
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

805
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,880
Lord, may I serve you coffee?

806
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,640
Yes.
- A glass of whiskey.

807
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,040
Want.

808
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,800
All signed and in order?

809
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,360
Do you have filled the orders.

810
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,600
Today at midnight, leaving a plane ...

811
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,600
"Please do not make any nonsense."

Hauptsturmfuhrer Dressler and will receive

813
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:24,280
any assistance from your staff
to escort Krauzenberg to aerodromes.

814
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,720
Yes Reichsfuhrer.
- Fine.

815
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,840
Reichsfuhrer!

816
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,840
Good f.

817
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,600
Let me introduce myself.

01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,680
Obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann.

819
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,080
This is Joseph Krauzenberg.
- I met with him.

820
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,360
and his wife, Madame Rachel Krauzenberg.

821
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,720
Heil Hitler!

822
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,440
Come on ... come on ...

Where are your manners?

824
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,720

827
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,480
I gave my word to Mrs. Krauzenberg!

828
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,440
Madam, my duty is ..

829
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,880
I will do everything possible
to hasten the evacuation.

830
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,840
Very good!

01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,440
Obershturmbanfyurera ensure ...

833
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,440
Our part here is already accomplished!

You have to say goodbye now.

Mr. Krauzenberg, to
shook hands on our agreement.

838
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:11,000
Now we are former business partners, right?

839
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,640
And you madam ...

840
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,600
You were most kind hostess.

841
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,000
Goodnight and goodbye, Reichsfuhrer.

842
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,760
I hope that it will not meet again!

843
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,680
Goodbye.

844
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,040

Heil Hitler

848
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,080
Thank you, darling.

849
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,680
Call you me sir?
- Yes, Vasman

850
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,080
Leaving tonight.

851
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,800
Wondering what will make you and Ingrid?

852
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,680
We have plans, sir.

853
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,680
I'm worried Mrs. Krauzenberg.

854
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,840
Ingrid!

855
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,520
We'll be fine.
- Hans no!

856
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,920
We will not be ...
We will not be good!

857
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,560
Sir.
Mme.

858
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,080
I must tell you a secret.

859
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,760
We are Jews!

860
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,640
Like you.

861
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,120
What?

862
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,920
You're Jewish?
- Yes, ma'am!

863
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,240
Born and raised in Germany.

864
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,760
Our names are David and Layla Staynberg.

865
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
We joined the Resistance.

866
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,960
They changed our names
Hans and Ingrid Vasman.

867
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,800
Perfect Aryan couple.

868
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,640
Oh my God!

869
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,640
I had no idea!

870
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,000
So I hate Nazis.

871
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Hans wanted tonight
to poison Himmler and

872
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,280
Eichmann cyanide pills.

873
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,600
What?

874
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,440
To poison Himmler and Eichmann?

875
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,520
This is it true Vasman?

876
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,720
What a mess!

877
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,040
What do you think?

878
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,480
Why can not we say that you are Jews?

879
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,840
We wanted to tell you sir.
We wanted ...

880
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,120
But we were not allowed.

881
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,640
SS now probably already knows
What is our identity.

882
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,480
Oh, my God!

883
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,760
I do not know what to do
what to say ...

884
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,920
Take us with you!

885
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,240
Too late!
It is impossible!

886
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,480
If we knew before, maybe ...

887
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,120
What we wanted to do was

888
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,920
to broadcast information about the camps

889
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,680
and what the Nazis
make our people.

890
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,360
Yes, yes, I know.

891
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,680
And what happens now?
Have a Plan?

892
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,680
Might flee to England.

893
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,920
Oh, Mr. Krauzenberg,
please ... please.

894
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,720
Take us with you, please!

895
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,360
Honey, you know?
We counted all!

896
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,880
This is the conclusion of the debates months

897
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,720
and negotiating for our lives.

898
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,040
Short in my heart when I see
everything that happens.

899
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,440
Madam, please!
Please!

900
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,160
I beg you, madam!

901
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,800
Please, please!
- Oh, my child!

902
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,520
Joseph will come up with something.

903
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,960
Eh, Joseph?

904
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,840
Will think about what can be done.

905
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,640
Thank you.

906
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:47,920
Ma'am?

907
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,920
Vasman.

908
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,480
These coins are very valuable.

909
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,600
Use them wisely and try
to buy your freedom.

910
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,520
Thank you.

911
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,640
Thank you, sir.

912
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,920
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

913
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,360
I hope that Eichmann
will not reveal.

914
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,360
While the need to go here.

915
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,880
Come on honey, gotta go.

916
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,200
Dressler, right?

917
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,200
I want to say something to you.

918
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,800
We'll talk in the car.

919
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:45,880
Well!

920
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,560
Goodbye and good luck!

921
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,200
Goodbye, sir.
- Bye.

922
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,080
Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

923
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,240
Are you mad at me?

924
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,640
Sorry.

925
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,360
No, I'm not angry.

926
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,360
I love you!

927
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,160
Get out!

928
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,800
Come on! Go! Go!

929
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,280
Keep going!
Keep going!

930
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,360
Go! Go!

931
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,200
Rachel!

932
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,080
Faster!? Faster!
Keep going!

933
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,040
Will look for confirmation
your safe arrival.

934
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:55,880
Yes.

935
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,400
And the last payment, of course.

936
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,960
Goodbye.

937
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,680
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

938
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,880
Well!

939
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,960
Edelhayn, Becker.
Come with me.

940
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,840
Obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann.

941
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,680
Good job.

942
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,120
Excuse Reichsfuhrer.

943
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,440
You should know something about
servants in the residence.

944
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,360
Edelhayn, we have many
more important things to do.

945
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,680
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

946
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,360
Report about the couple arrived Vasman.

947
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,600
It is confirmed that they are Jews.
- Hebrews?

948
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,440
Would not be prudent to say
Reichsfuhrer of truth to them.

949
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
They should be executed.

950
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,000
Yeah, maybe you're right.

951
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,360
You'll save all this problems.

952
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,480
Leave it to me.

953
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,400
I will take care of them.

954
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,600
As you Dressler.

955
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,080
I need their
admissions to the file.

956
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,880
It will not be disappointed.

957
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,240
Properties of Krauzenberg.
Vasman speak.

958
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,120
Want to talk to the keeper.

959
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:41,960
Hello!

960
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,320
There is a call for you.

961
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,640
Say?

962
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,400
Stop!

963
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Come on!

964
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,400
How long have you been quartered here?

965
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,160
3 months Hauptsturmfuhrer,

966
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,720
but leaving tomorrow for the Russian Front

967
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,040
with the rest of my regiment

968
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,800
On the Russian front.

969
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,640
Interesting.

970
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,760
What is your name?
- Vahtmayster Schmidt, Hauptsturmfuhrer.

971
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,960
Follow me.

972
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,840
Wait here.

973
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,680
You either move back to the barracks.

974
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,320
Tell my driver to go with you.

975
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,040
Yes, Hauptsturmfuhrer.

976
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,440
No! No!

977
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,360
Please!
I beg you.

978
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,320
Please do not.
Please.

979
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:59,560
Gerhard ... Gerhard ...
Help us!

980
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,680
Gerhard, please!

981
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,720
What is wrong?

982
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,600
Buck up!

983
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,800
Come with me.

984
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,440
Come on!

985
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,320
Come here!

986
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,080
Stay here and keep.

987
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,640
Go!

988
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,960
Go!

989
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,960
Quick!

990
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,480
Left!
Left!

991
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,080
On your knees!

992
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,840
Flight of Krauzenberg passed without problems.

993
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,600
And we must be killed!

994
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,120
Such is the commandment.

995
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,560
Will die because you are Jewish.

996
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,040
Do not deny it.

997
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,480
Shut up!

998
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,120
Krauzenberg and his wife gave you.

999
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,400
They asked me to arrange your
travel documents.

1000
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,640
I also said Krauzenberg
Gold, which has given you.

1001
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,320
Where is the gold?

1002
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,520
Take it.

1003
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,280
Take it.

1004
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,200
Spare my wife.

1005
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,080
Impossible.

1006
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,000
Do you love to kill Jews.
- Exactly.

1007
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,680
God help you!

1008
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,280
Already helped me!

1009
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,600
Already have the gold.

1010
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,920
Let my wife.

1011
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,280
My orders are to
telephoned Eichmann

1012
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,000
and make you confess
real names.

1013
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,360
Wants to hear how you executed.

1014
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,160
Obershturmbanfyurer,
This is Dressler.

1015
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,480
Yes, both are here.

1016
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,920
Talk.

1017
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,040
Tell your real names.

1018
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,920
My name ...

1019
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,360
My name is David Staynberg.

1020
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,720
You!

1021
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,320
My name is .. Leila Staynberg.

1022
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,200
Yes obershturmbanfyurer

1023
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,480
lie like pigs.

1024
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,200
You must kill him first

1025
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,840
and then her.

1026
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,600
The woman is still alive.

1027
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,400
Both are dead.

1028
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,840
Heil Hitler.

1029
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,760
Get up!

1030
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:35,960
Get up!

1031
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,600
Change.

1032
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,760
Going to Switzerland.

1033
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,520
To meet Krauzenberg.

1034
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,520
Hurry.

1035
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,160
Move quickly!

1036
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,120
In the car.

1037
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,320
And your wife?

1038
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,440
Comes.

1039
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,160
Here are the transit documents
and tickets for the train.

1040
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,160
This will come to Switzerland.

1041
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,480
Are you sure?

1042
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:08,520
These are individually stamped by Himmler.

1043
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,840
You will not ask questions.

1044
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,840
If we ask why go to Switzerland?

1045
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,080
On a visit in brain
specialist in epilepsy

1046
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,600
Dr. Heinrich Shtarman, remember the name.

1047
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,240
And if you ask us why we carry documents
stamped by Reichsfuhrer?

1048
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,320
Nobody will ask,
if you behave properly,

1049
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,800
but if you ask, you are his
personal music assistant.

1050
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,280
I will contact you with
obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann, please?

1051
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,160
Understand.

1052
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,880
Maybe you will help me.

1053
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,720
Can you tell me,
whether the two civilians

1054
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,160
Hans and Ingrid Vasman

1055
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,800
are brought in for questioning today?

1056
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,720
Nobody has brought.

1057
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,680
Understand.

1058
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,840
Are you sure?

1059
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,800
Thank you.

1060
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,160
They will escape!

1061
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,920
Who?

1062
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,840
Servants of Krauzenberg.
- Impossible.

1063
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,280
Were killed by Dressler.

1064
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,320
Who told you that?

1065
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,960
Call me from the palace.
I heard it.

1066
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,960
Where are the bodies?
- Buried.

1067
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,400
I was there ...

1068
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,360
I found it.

1069
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,400
Look!

1070
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,840
I saw the grave.

1071
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,160
There was the corpse of the Germanic warrior.

1072
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,480
They lied!

1073
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,800
I was told to be polite with them.

1074
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,720
My job is not to ask questions.

1075
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,720
Yes.

1076
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,240
Will find and execute them individually.

1077
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,720
Raise the alarm of two young Jews

1078
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,160
heading to the Swiss border.

1079
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,480
My staff will give you
complete description of them.

1080
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,480
She is a Jew?

1081
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,480
When you arrive at
Austrian-Swiss border

1082
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,320
will be your last
check before freedom.

1083
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,840
Krauzenberg will wait for the second station.

1084
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,840
His name is Reynau.

1085
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,680
Beware.
Do not trust anyone.

1086
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,200
Here.

1087
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,000
Here is some money.

1088
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,120
Not as good as your gold,

1089
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,440
but enough to get.

1090
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,080
I advise you to go.

1091
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,640
Thanks for everything.

1092
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,760
While passing through
personnel of the Gestapo.

1093
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,760
Remain calm.

1094
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,400
And if you ask us,

1095
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,640
why we carry documents
stamped by Reichsfuhrer?

1096
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,640
You are his personal
musical assistants.

1097
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,520
What are you doing Edelhayn?

1098
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,720
Where are they?

1099
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,240
Travel.

1100
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,840
How much you paid,

1101
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,840
to join Krauzenberg?

1102
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:33,600
I suggest you to discuss
Reichsfuhrer with this.

1103
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,080
No.

1104
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,800
With someone else.

1105
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,360
Get his gun.

1106
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,760
Now I officially arrested.

1107
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,680
Makes a big mistake.

1108
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,320
They have official documents.

1109
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,320
Impossible.

1110
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,560
Unless you falsified them.

1111
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,880
Shoot him if moved.

1112
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,880
Yes, Obersturmführer.

1113
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,120
Say goodbye to your family.

1114
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,400
Everything will be fine.

1115
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,320
Yes, Sturmbannführer?

1116
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,280
I just received information

1117
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,720
that a young Jewish couple
trying to escape

1118
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,120
to Switzerland with false documents.

1119
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,920
We know their description?
- Everything.

1120
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:52,200
They also wanted to
murder of a Germanic warrior.

1121
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,400
Log.

1122
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,360
You shouted me Reichsfuhrer?

1123
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,960
Yes. Sit.

1124
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,280
Eichmann woke me up to my
said about the Aryan couple.

1125
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:23,440
Looks like they are actually Jews.

1126
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:28,360
And Dressler was captured,
as some their accomplice.

1127
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,920
Sorry to hear it.

1128
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,560
We need to talk with Dressler.

1129
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,760
He was the last man
Krauzenberg talked to.

1130
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,760
Yes.

1131
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,920
There is no doubt that they will meet
with Krauzenberg in Switzerland.

1132
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,120
What do you suggest?

1133
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,120
You still need to get ...

1134
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,040
large quantity of gold.

1135
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,920
And the signatures on bank transfers.

1136
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,400
And of course Krauzenberg

1137
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,680
do not want to happen is nothing wrong

1138
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,200
of its 3000 employees.

1139
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:58,920
Offer.

1140
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:02,080
Do not do anything at this point.

1141
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,040
Well.

1142
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,680
The one who cares for
Both Jews fleeing Eichmann.

1143
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,360
And it seems Edelhayn.

1144
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,160
Embark is to stop them.

1145
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,040
Send order.

1146
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,920
Germany, my Germany, we are coming!

1147
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,760
Germany, they freed us!

1148
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,160
Manning, Manning next stop!

1149
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,400
Everybody get down!

1150
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,720
Next stop Manning.

1151
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,000
Border control!

1152
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,400
Control of the Swiss border.

1153
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,720
All disembarking from the train!

1154
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,520
Honey.

1155
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,160
Whatever happened to us.

1156
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,880
Remember that I have always loved you.

1157
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:04,320
Ready?

1158
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,560
Come on.

1159
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,360
These two meet
the description of Eichmann.

1160
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,520
Yeah, right ...

1161
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,160
Tell the guard.

1162
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,520
Sturmbannführer, there is an urgent call for you.

1163
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,080
Take care.

1164
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,080
Prepare documents.

1165
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:01,920
Prepare documents.

1166
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,440
Hallo!

1167
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,880
Yes.

1168
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,120
Yes, I can assure you ...

1169
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,440
... I already got this information.

1170
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,720
We are already in motion.

1171
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,880
Everything is under control.

1172
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,160
In all due respect.

1173
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,760
Information which
received came directly

1174
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,600
from the office of
obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann

1175
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,200
Understand.

1176
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:46,240
Can I ask what power
represent?

1177
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,160
Mr. and Mrs. Vasman.

1178
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,600
I think I will want Sturmbannführer
To view your personal documents.

1179
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,320
Of course, there a problem?

1180
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,920
Not routine practice.

1181
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,400
Please.

1182
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,840
Log.

1183
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,400
Understand.

1184
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,200
Will assure that it is done.

1185
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,240
I understand perfectly.

1186
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:55,280
Mr. and Mrs. Vasman.

1187
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:04,280
Sorry for the delay.

1188
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:10,160
Your documents are in order.

1189
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,280
You can go.
- Thanks.

1190
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,320
Thank you, sir.
Good night.

1191
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:49,960
Stop!

1192
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,000
Good morning, Ingrid.

1193
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,840
Good morning, Hans.

1194
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,920
I think we need to
answer some questions.

1195
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,160
Have to come with me.

1196
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,400
No!
- No.

1197
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,480
They'll shoot.

1198
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,840
Come on. Fast.

1199
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,360
Are you Edelhayn?

1200
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:29,880
I am.

1201
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,880
Who gave you authority to do this?

1202
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,000
Obershturmbanfyurer Eichmann.

1203
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,480
But not, Reichsfuhrer Himmler!

1204
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,520
No, but they are Jews and
traveling with false documents.

1205
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,600
I was so informed.

1206
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:45,360
But now I understand that delays departure

1207
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,000
personal music
Advisers Reichsfuhrer.

1208
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,600
Personal advisers music?

1209
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,240
They are Jews!

1210
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:55,640
And try to escape!

1211
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:59,160
I just talked personally with Reichsfuhrer.

1212
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,120
Were wrongly classified as Jews.

1213
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,080
Now let them go.

1214
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,600
The train departs. Suggest
you do not release.

1215
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,280
They are Jews!

1216
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:13,640
Do not, repeat orders Obersturmführer!

1217
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,000
Mr. and Mrs. Vasman, go.

1218
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,600
Dismissed.

1219
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,200
Quick, do not miss the train.

1220
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:22,400
Stop them!

1221
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:24,160
They are Jews!

1222
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,720
Stop them, Ingrid Vasman!

1223
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:47,960
Is not it beautiful?

1224
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:52,600
Next stop: Reynau.

1225
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:55,920
Next stop: Reynau.

1226
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,360
Next stop: Reynau.

1227
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:01,360
Arrived.

1228

Glad to see you, sir.

A new life?

1230
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,240
Yes.
- Yes!

1231
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,280
Ten years later
