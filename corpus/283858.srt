1
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:49,587
As a doctor ...

2
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:53,898
The most regretful thing could be
when the one you care for most

3
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,195
Has physical problems ...

4
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:01,669
And there's nothing you can do about it

5
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:09,409
This experience can be very terrible

6
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:12,818
S he once said

7
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,918
S he wished l would be a brilliant doctor

8
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:20,320
lf l weren't in the past, l must be in future

9
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:25,264
Now this is the thing ...

10
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,000
That l can still do for her

11
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,269
S he left all of a sudden

12
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,935
So sudden ... when you think of it later ...

13
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,336
You can still feel the pain

14
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,678
lf anyone wants to know ...

15
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,077
How the pain feels

16
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,384
l can tell them

17
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:52,949
lt's best you don't ever have a chance
to know

18
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:14,839
One more round?

19
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:15,946
That's enough for tonight

20
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,181
You are on dirty jokes every time

21
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:22,045
S he's been staring at you all night

22
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:25,353
Did you really not notice
or are you just pretending?

23
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,291
Okay?

24
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,224
May be l'm not

25
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,064
Please give me a glass of water

26
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,069
ls the pager yours?

27
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:45,808
Yes, thank you

28
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,245
Thanks

29
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:01,821
You really don't want another glass?

30
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:02,962
No

31
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:04,696
Bye Bye

32
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,141
Are you okay?

33
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,850
My neck got hurt

34
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,988
l am a doctor. l'll sent you to the hospital
right now

35
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:40,760
What's up in the ER?

36
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:43,093
Police-gangster gun fight, serious

37
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,395
There's a cop upstairs waiting for you
to do surgery

38
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,299
There are two cops in there
we're trying to save

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,769
Thank you

40
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,568
He always thought

41
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:54,440
l was responsible for ...

42
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,212
The death of his brother

43
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,479
Up till now, l still couldn't make him
understand

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,889
Sometimes what a doctor can do
is very limited

45
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,261
l've found the bullet

46
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,709
l heard you were in a car accident
just now

47
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:37,680
Again it's heavy rain

48
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,092
And a driver who is hit-and-run

49
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,559
What's different is that this time
l did not die

50
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,487
The most important thing is
that you are safe

51
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,625
What about the car? Need to replace it?

52
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,795
What's the fun about it?

53
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:51,031
l don't understand what's so exciting

54
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,803
lt's human life!

55
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:58,538
lt's your own business if you want
to kill yourself

56
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:00,777
Why get others into trouble too?

57
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:18,494
Everything in life seems to
remain unchanged

58
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,801
The books and magazines she ordered

59
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,770
Are still delivered at the right time

60
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,976
The cat she took care of

61
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:36,949
Although it had run away

62
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,347
lt still appear before me sometimes

63
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,819
The most incomprehensible difference
could be ...

64
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,926
When she was beside me in the past,
l would dream of her

65
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:51,791
After she's gone

66
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,730
She never appeared in my dream

67
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,074
Mandy?

68
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,479
Are you looking for Tse Yuen-han?

69
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,710
You must have long ...

70
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,955
The phone call the other night

71
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,656
May be she wanted me to know

72
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,159
l could have understood her a bit more

73
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,127
Dr Ching

74
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,027
Tak

75
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,665
lt was such big trouble last night,
if you weren't around

76
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,059
We'd have a headache

77
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:30,425
Did you see Dr Fong?

78
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,203
He's left, didn't he tell you?

79
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:33,836
No

80
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,497
Right, Dr Fong asked me to tell you

81
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:38,939
lf it's convenient for you, can you
lend me a thousand dollars

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,104
Bye

83
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,522
Yes

84
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,221
l'm at the bank now

85
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,894
You call me when you are done

86
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,530
Okay, bye

87
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,660
What a coincidence!

88
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:04,699
Excuse me ...

89
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,428
The bank is closed

90
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:07,630
Are you busy?

91
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:09,169
Not too busy

92
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,473
lt's happy even if it is busy
in the delivery room

93
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:14,571
Yes

94
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,183
S ir, please queue up here

95
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,011
What? Do l have to queue up to rob?

96
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:22,347
Freeze!

97
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,979
lf you shoot, l'll kill her!

98
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,554
Put the gun down! Put it down!

99
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,051
Put the gun down! Put it down!

100
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,293
Come here! Come here quick!

101
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,430
Give me all the money!

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,397
Who is it? Who pressed the alarm?
Come out!

103
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:36,567
Come out!

104
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,034
Go over! Go over!

105
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:39,535
Who? Who ...

106
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,140
Buddy, it's like this, don't be nervous ...

107
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,502
lf you rob, someone would press
the alarm

108
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:45,768
l'm not afraid of them!

109
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:46,736
You just shut up

110
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:47,902
l'll finish all of you!

111
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,682
The thinner is very dangerous,
don't do anything silly!

112
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:55,847
You can't light it!

113
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,864
Please stay calm!

114
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,068
Everyone stay calm! Don't run around!

115
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,071
The door is locked, what shall we do?

116
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:20,040
Everyone move away!

117
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,872
S lowly, don't be nervous

118
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,939
Hold on, l'll ask my colleague to help

119
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,504
Thank you

Karen

122
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,141
Are you okay?

123
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,341
l'm fine

124
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:01,713
Can you come here to help

125
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,349
Don't worry, my colleague will help you

126
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,758
You are hurt too

127
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:09,360
l'm fine

128
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,596
You take care of her

129
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,629
Relax your feet, right

130
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,935
Give way ...

131
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,381
Don't worry, it'll be fine, hold on

132
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,074
Paul!

133
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:33,649
Are you okay?

134
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,809
Why are you here?

135
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,780
l heard there was trouble at the bank
you went to

136
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,049
l was worried you might be sent to ER

137
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:39,282
So l came over to see

138
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,152

139
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,094
S ince you are here, why don't you help

140
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,455
Do you need to tell me?

141
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,560
The people here are all conscious?

142
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,026
Everyone don't panic

143
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:59,675
Miss ...

144
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,782
Someone here has crashed! Help!

145
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,688
Take to Room 3!

146
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:20,861
You're here too?

147
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,058
Don't ask now

148
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:30,666

Be careful, mister!

151
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:39,815
Go away! Give way ...

152
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:43,746
Sandy, drip!

153
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,188
Miss, hold out!

154
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,326
Need help?

155
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,125
Cut the crap, move!

156
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:54,962
Doctor, the one just sent in is a suspect

157
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,190
We need to keep custody of him

158
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,233
We don't care who he is,
our duty is to save people

159
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,099
We don't care what you do,
just don't interfere with our work

160
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,265
What's the BP? How is he doing?

161
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,104
BP 90/50, pulse 1 42, SAO2 76

162
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,839
Traver 8.5, get the machine ready

163
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,345
TlDE volume 500cc, Peep 6, Rate 1 2

164
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,825
The larynx is swelling,
tracheotomy needed

165
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,324
Scalpel

166
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,561
Trachea-dilator

167
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,668
Trachea-tube

168
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:44,106
Okay, connect to machine

Send to lCU

00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,424
How's he doing?

172
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,424
Just did an ultrasound. The baby's gone

173
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:57,253
Her family is outside,
we haven't told them yet

174
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,055
Take her to the lCU

175
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:04,459
Checked with lCU, they have only one
bedspace left

176
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:05,862
Who shall we send first?

177
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:07,931
This woman

178
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,310
How about taking a bath first?

179
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:14,904
S ure

180
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,345
Thereafter would you drive me home?

181
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,810
No problem

182
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:20,749
Give me some time

183
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:22,346
What do you want?

184
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,347
So much has happened, l need to talk to
a friend

185
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,525
A girl friend is a girl friend, friend?

186
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,022
Get to the point

187
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,989
Just a little while, it'll be quick

188
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,641
Wait and see. A few days later

189
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:50,279
l'll show you some of my childhood
photos

190
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,051
And you'll know how l different
look now

191
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,346
You plan to chat with your girl friend
through to dawn, right?

192
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:58,387
l'm leaving

193
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,582
No, we're almost through

194
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:01,953
l don't want to disturb your rest

195
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,686
lt's you who needs a rest, you still
need to come back for surgery

196
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:05,761
lt's morning

197
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,154
Yes

198
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:09,962
l'd better go

199
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:29,882
What are you up to?

200
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,886
Don't you get bored listening to the
same song over and over?

201
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,628
Everyone who sits in my car say that

202
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,364
lt must be your problem,
or people wouldn't say that

203
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:40,892
What's my problem?

204
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,159
lt's no different from playing with
the same toy

205
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,160
Please pay a little respect

206
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,873
Human feelings need to be exchanged,
do you understand?

207
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,473
We do interchange feelings!

208
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:52,370
l don't understand what you are up to

209
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,474
Wasting your time and effort doing
something which leads to nowhere

210
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,148
So long as l am happy

211
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:58,714
who cares if it leads to nowhere

212
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:00,645
Only you are happy now

213
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:01,945
Do you think she is happy?

214
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,622
S he will be, we exchange feelings

215
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,157
l also hope she can live like a
normal person

216
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,038
There are lots of things which we don't
get even if we want to

217
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,399
Dr Ching, you're here to visit
Mrs Cheung again?

218
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:25,635
Yes

219
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:27,940
Her things are still here

220
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:29,739
Yes, we have looked everywhere

221
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,251
What should we do?

222
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,648
What happened to Mrs Cheung?

223
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,946
Dr Ching, can we talk outside?

224
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,691
Do you know where Mrs Cheung is now?

225
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,090
Of course l don't, haven't you been
looking for her?

226
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,166
S he had been very depressed earlier

227
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,470
S he even goes around saying she wants
to commit suicide

228
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:54,805
S hould we consider calling the police?

229
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,306
S he is depressed because of you,
Dr Ching

230
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,439
What has it got to do with me?

231
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,445
Because you told her that she has
a tumor in her brain

232
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:05,106
and only has two more years to live

233
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,545
l did say that

234
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,381
But as a doctor, l have a duty ...

235
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:12,784
to let a patient know of her situation

236
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,526
Doesn't your conscience feel bad?

237
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,024
What if she commits suicide because of
what you said?

238
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,564
l think you should call the police first

239
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:23,827
Nurse S hek, Dr Ching, they found
Mrs Cheung

240
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:25,196
She is on the roof-top

241
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,111
What shall we do now?

242
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,313
You talk to her first

243
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:47,915
Mrs Cheung

244
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:52,988
Don't come over

245
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,832
l am going to die, why are you still
bothering me?

246
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,093
Don't be so agitated

247
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,268
Everyone in the hospital wants to
help you

248
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:01,503
There's nothing that can't be resolved,
right?

249
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:03,672
How can it be resolved?

250
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,608
l have cancer

251
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,839
And see how my husband treats me now

252
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,908
There's no one to look after the child
after he's born

253
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,377
What's there left to live for?

254
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,016
Nowadays cancer is not incurable

255
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,187
Why lose hope so soon?

256
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,553
lt's you doctors who told me that!

257
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,094
Don't bother me!

258
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:25,723
You come closer and l'll jump!

259
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,590
Don't!

260
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,564
Go away!

261
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,201
Okay ...

262
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,496
Don't be agitated

263
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:34,100
We'll move away

264
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:41,739
Don't come over!

265
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:43,373
Don't come over ...

266
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:45,277
You come over and l'll jump!

267
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,884
Calm down ...

268
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,752
Don't come over!

269
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,788
Don't be so tense, l just want to train
my guts in this good weather

270
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,115
l'm more scared than you are

271
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:53,953
Don't come over!

272
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:56,227
Okay ... don't move ...

273
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,597
l'm not moving

274
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,763
Normally l wouldn't choose a place
like this to chat

275
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,567
l'll give in to you today

276
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,568
You told me l have brain cancer ...

277
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,637
and l only have two more years at most

278
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,377
Now you tell me that l can be cured?

279
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,476
You just say whatever you like!

280
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,180
We are not driveling

281
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,116
We are telling the truth

282
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:23,985
Do you still remember?

283
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,421
The other day l told you the worst result

284
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:29,460
but it may not happen

285
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:31,930
My husband is afraid l might get cancer

286
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,723
He left with another woman

287
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,495
He will know about your illness sooner
or later

288
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,204
lf he doesn't support you

289
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,871
he doesn't deserve to be your husband

290
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,539
Why should you do such a silly thing
because of him?

291
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:46,944
What about my child then?

292
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,213
Who would take care of him after
he's born?

293
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,047
lf you have recovered, you can
take care of him

294
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:53,246
You told me l would die

295
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,750
Do you believe so much in what l say?

296
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,519
What if l tell you that the tumor
in your brain ...

297
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,526
may not be that desperate?

298
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:10,032
What l said the other day, is so that you
would not be like other people ...

299
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:14,633
Who die before they have time to do
something for the people they care

300
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,699
Can l really be cured?

301
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:22,847
My legs really feel a bit weak chatting
like this

302
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,850
Why don't we go inside first?

303
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,585
Come escort Mrs Cheung to her room
quick

304
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,760
Count yourself lucky this time

305
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:39,487
As a doctor, please be careful with
what you say to your patients

306
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:43,024
Just now it was me who persuaded her
to come back

307
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,035
Talking to you is a waste of my time!

308
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:55,803
Kelvin is coming up to find me

309
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,341
You must remember

310
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,982
You haven't seen me

311
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,518
Where's Dr Ching?

312
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,388
We haven't seen him

313
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:19,063
Then call him immediately!

314
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,602
This is crazy! What does he think
he is doing?

315
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:45,257
Sorry for interrupting

316
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:46,795
l'll be leaving soon

317
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,394
Paul often tell me ...

318
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,494
That you can hear what he says

319
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,204
And can communicate with him

320
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:57,039
l have some reservations about this

321
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,298
l know, what doctors can do ...

322
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,934
can be very limited sometimes

323
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:28,066
We have all worked hard during this time

324
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:30,433
Still she hasn't improved

325
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,338
So l pray for her everyday

326
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,776
May be that's the only thing
we can do for her

327
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:41,052
Don't laugh, miracles sometimes
happen that way

328
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:58,933
l won't disturb your sleep

329
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:26,958
Paul!

330
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:28,591
Your girl friend just woke up!

331
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:29,730
What?

332
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,699
Your girl friend is awake,
she regained consciousness

333
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:32,496
How could that happen?

334
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,229
l don't know. May be it's a miracle

335
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,668
Let's not talk, and go to see her

336
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:42,807
Congratulations!

337
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,106
This time you waited till she wakes

338
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,607
You should buy us a meal

339
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,580
Right, we should celebrate

340
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,117
We need to have a few tables

341
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:50,845
Everyone in the hospital is happy for you

342
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,819
lf won't be enough if you don't have
a few tables

343
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,923
This time girlfriend really becomes
your girlfriend

344
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:57,028
You have to treat her well in future

345
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,455
ls it my turn yet?

346
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:00,894
What else have you to say?

347
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,133
l'll look for a place

348
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,333
l'll arrange the menu

349
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:04,332
That's settled

350
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:05,667
Where shall we go?

351
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:09,301
You're coming too?

352
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:10,442
What about your girlfriend?

353
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:11,870
ln good condition

354
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,679
l don't mean physically, l mean
emotionally

355
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:17,406
Well ... not bad

356
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,089
Wake up, press the button

357
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,087
You won't get up by tomorrow
if you just stand here

358
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:28,451
l was just about to press

359
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,522
People who are easily satisfied are
the most happy

360
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:33,932
S uch kind of relationship, which starts
from wishful thinking

361
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,962
Could have such a happy ending

362
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:38,000
Hello. Hi

363
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,569
Busy? Haven't seen you all day

364
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:42,270
You have to take care of someone,
so l took over your place

365
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,869
lt's lunch

366
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:48,044
l went to visit her in physiotherapy
and then drove her here

367
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,506
Did you wake me up?

368
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:52,614
l don't think l need to introduce

369
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,082
Can you tell me honestly

370
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:59,424
what did you do to me the other day
in my room?

371
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,455
Paul know me very well

372
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:05,196
l ...

373
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,298
l can do anything, so ...

374
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:10,495
Think yourself

375
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:14,605
Lawrence loves to make jokes in front of
old friends

376
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:17,239
Gotta get back to work

377
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,142
Bye

378
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,151
Why are you here?

379
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,226
Don't ask

380
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:39,795
You can't just run away like this

381
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,226
Paul will be worried

382
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,457
Please, l'll have these

383
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,129
You listen to me first

384
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:46,665
You listen to me ...

385
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:48,566
Did you drive?

386
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:50,606
Can you drive me to the cemetery?

387
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,849
l feel comfortable here at the cemetery

388
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:01,649
l have a friend buried here too

389
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,687
Why didn't you go and say hello to him
just now?

390
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,020
Can we go back now?

391
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,893
Today is the anniversary of
my grandma's death

392
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,724
l thought l should come and see her

393
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,462
Who are you calling?

394
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,329
l am calling Paul to tell him
what happened

395
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,835
l know you care about me

396
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,035
But l need some privacy too

397
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:29,976
Can you give me a little time ...

398
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,309
So l can do what l want?

399
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,245
lt's not that l don't let you have
your private time

400
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,080
lt's not right to sneak out

401
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:37,783
Can you give me back my mobile phone?

402
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:39,858
Let's go

403
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:51,264
Health is really very important

404
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,395
To be honest, the food in your hospital ...

405
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:54,731
ls terrible

406
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:01,106
That's about all for today?

407
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:03,845
Have l given you trouble?

408
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,444
Someone is worried about you

409
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:11,414
Did you regret waking me?

410
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:13,556
You really think it has to do with me?

411
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,089
l presume it has

412
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,189
Without you, l wouldn't have today

413
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,227
l'm not the one who's helped the most

414
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:28,266
Let's go

415
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:34,904
Tell me honestly

416
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:37,511
did you do anything to my brain?

417
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,343
What do you mean?

418
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,785
lt's very complicated, l can't get it right

419
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:46,184
l just feel that l wasn't like that before

420
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:48,851
But if l really am different from my past

421
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,557
l shouldn't feel like l have changed myself

422
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:54,764
Do you understand what l'm saying?

423
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,230
To make it simpler ...

424
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,134
What were you like before?

425
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,770
See that girl over there?

426
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:10,309
l was like her in the past

427
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:27,463
Where are we going?

428
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,325
l only know l have to take you back
to the hospital

429
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,848
How can someone drive like that?

430
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:00,289
What are you doing?

431
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,500
That driver could be my buddy

432
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:04,959
l don't get it

433
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,507
Stop playing!

434
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:16,813
l'm not playing with him

435
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,482
l want to see who kill my girl friend

436
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:51,410
Take a rest

437
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,623
l said it before

438
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,188
That's the end of your car

439
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,461
l'm sorry

440
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:11,901
lt's lucky l am not marred

441
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,662
Or l won't let you get away with it

442
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,937
They are arranging for you to do
a CT-brain

443
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,905
Not again?

444
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,072
Only Paul knows how to handle you

445
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:25,374
You take a rest first

446
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:32,390
This time l brought you good luck

447
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,649
Next time don't act on impulse again

448
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,392
Dr Ching, l heard you hit your car again

449
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,695
l'm not in a good mood today!

450
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,300
Don't make me angry of l won't be
easy on you!

451
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:47,227
You hear that?

452
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,270
Doctors can be in a bad mood too

453
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:51,702
Learn from others when you have time

454
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,181
l believe in retribution, it's just that
the time hasn't come

455
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:04,612
Don't stretch yourself too much, it's hard

456
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,065
What are you doing here?

457
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:15,356
Working

458
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:17,894
Can you disclose?

459
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,799
A relative of one of our patients here ...

460
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,529
#NAME?

461
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,367
You think they have a case?

462
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:26,938
The deceased is the robber in the bank
arson case

463
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,737
They want to sue the doctors here
for discriminating against him

464
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,710
S uch that he did not receive
proper treatment ...

465
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:33,684
#NAME?

466
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,485
Would we?

467
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:37,815
l won't interrupt you,
l'll call later for lunch

468
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:38,921
Okay

469
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,223
You know each other?

470
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,551
Yes, bye

471
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:44,992
Miss Tsien, please come to my office
to talk

472
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,221
Okay

473
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,062
Kelvin is looking for you, he wants to
see you

474
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:55,106
He must want to talk about
the suicide incident

475
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,067
Tell him l don't have time

476
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,537
l told him already, but he is coming up
now

477
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,073
Then say l am not here

478
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,176
How can l say that? You are here

479
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,849
Can't l just not be here immediately!
Christina!

480
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,109
As you wish

481
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,561
Kelvin!

482
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:22,824
Just want to find you,
you're looking for me?

483
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:23,896
Please come in

484
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:25,032
Okay

485
00:30:25,437 --> 00:30:27,132
l want to talk to you about something

486
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:32,807
That fire at the bank, you helped
saving people, didn't you?

487
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,843
Not only me, a lot of people helped

488
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:40,216
S .Y. ... he is in trouble this time

489
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:42,116
What trouble?

490
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,854
One of the patients died and wants to
affix responsibility

491
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,485
How can l help?

492
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,289
l want to know more about
the situation that day

493
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,531
Will you help him?

494
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:02,671
Anyway l believe him,
l'm sure he can pay

495
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,342
He's a friend

496
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:05,532
Okay

497
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:08,412
Worst come to worst, you just pay

498
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:09,839
lt's nothing

499
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,549
Doctors can be a high risk business

500
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,913
lt seems that the risk of a patient is higher?

501
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:18,684
How can you say that?

502
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:21,882
l won't argue with you, l'll be more
worried if l win

503
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,126
Hi, haven't seen you for a long time

504
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,234
Hello

505
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:34,427
You know Anthony?

506
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:35,940
Hello

507
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:37,108
Hello

508
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,469
We haven't been formally introduced

509
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,571
l won't disturb you, let's have lunch
when we have time

510
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,346
Okay

511
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,179
He is not a good guy

512
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,478
That Anthony is a triad member

513
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:53,515
Really can't tell from his looks

514
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,592
So you can also be very hypocritical

515
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,401
Look!

516
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:13,811
Are you fishing or feeding the fish?

517
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:16,208
That's not where the fun is

518
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:19,111
The most important thing is to enjoy
the process

519
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,384
lt's like drinking and not be drunk

520
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,254
Playing mahjong and not winning

521
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,286
Courting a girl and not having sex
with her?

522
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,823
You really know how to console yourself

523
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:35,356
What else can l do?

524
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,330
S he said to me

525
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,634
Thanked me for taking care of her
these days

526
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:42,300
But ...

527
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:45,941
That nothing can happen between us

528
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,579
S he's right

529
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:50,504
lt's just my wild fantasy

530
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,495
What are you doing here early
in the morning?

531
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,196
Looking for a place to live

532
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,133
Here?

533
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:19,401
lt can't be

534
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:21,673
S houldn't be a problem, right?

535
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:28,813
Would it be inconvenient?

536
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,682
There's no other way, the rent is cheap

537
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:33,682
How long are you planning to stay?

538
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:35,584
Until l find a job

539
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,885
l think l can still survive a week

540
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:41,027
Why don't l help you look for
a decent hotel?

541
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,756
Would you pay for me first?

542
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,864
No problem, you can pay me back
when you find a job

543
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:47,265
Thanks in advance

544
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,838
But l'm not used to borrowing money
from someone l don't know too well

545
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:53,636
So what do you want?

546
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:54,709
l am okay

547
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,641
Bye

548
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:12,523
Now what?

549
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:15,425
You're right, it's really not that
convenient here

550
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,531
Well, if you really want to help me

551
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:19,704
can you find me a place which is
free of charge?

552
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,431
l just need a place to take a bath
and sleep

553
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:32,872
Dr Ching

554
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,681
Jessinta

555
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,716
S he comes here a few times a week
to help

556
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:39,824
Hello

557
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,258
Okay, l'm leaving

558
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:42,448
Why are you leaving?

559
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,485
l don't want to disturb you

560
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:45,754
No problem

561
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,225
Miss Kong is my friend. S he is
staying here for a few days

562
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,798
Then should l come here these few days?

563
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:50,899
Why not?

564
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:52,091
l thought ...

565
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,265
Okay, l understand

566
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:57,366
S it over there

567
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:01,337
There's no place to walk around,
it's all in front of you

568
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,473
This is a special place

569
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,578
You collect old books and magazines?

570
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:09,613
l didn't collect them on purpose

571
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:12,150
This is my study room

572
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,052
This is a sofa bed, you can sleep here for
the time being

573
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,652
Your study room?

574
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:18,362
Would l be interrupting with your work?

575
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,789
My job is very simple, l just need to
cut people up

576
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:25,264
Thanks, it's really for the time being only

577
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,698
l won't interrupt you too long

578
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:29,268
Jessinta!

579
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,031
Yes, Dr Ching?

580
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,204
Please open up this sofa bed for me

581
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:34,775
And see what else Miss Kong needs

582
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:36,002
Yes

583
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,745
Sorry to trouble you

584
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,442
Never mind. lt's alright

585
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:43,677
But this thing hasn't been opened
for a long time

586
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:45,715
l guess it is not that difficult to open

587
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,521
By the way, how did you meet Dr Ching?

588
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,090
We met at the hospital

589
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:52,795
So you are a doctor too

590
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:53,893
No

591
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,195
Nurse?

592
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:57,166
No

593
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,265
Pharmacist?

594
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,630
No

595
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:02,004
Jessinta

596
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,332
Dr Ching?

597
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:05,370
What is it?

598
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,142
l only asked you to help

599
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:09,442
l didn't ask you to play Q & A with her

600
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:11,205
We were just chatting

601
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,550
Have you picked up the suit
from the laundry?

602
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:15,218
Okay, l'll get it in a minute

603
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:23,016
Miss Kong, did you see that?

604
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,485
See what?

605
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:26,027
He was so sarcastic at me

606
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:28,758
l think he must be in a good mood today

607
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,865
Usually he doesn't talk to me

608
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:32,697
ls he that funny?

609
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:34,698
l have worked for him so long

610
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,498
This is the first time he brings
a woman home

611
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:37,806
Really

612
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,641
And you are staying here too

613
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:43,770
You don't worry, Dr Ching is a gentleman

614
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,049
lt's only me and him in the house all day

615
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:47,445
and he was never impolite to me

616
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:50,216
Okay. l'll get you the blankets

617
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,127
l don't understand why you won't let me
clean the table

618
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,133
l just don't want you to mess up
my things

619
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,270
What's wrong with this?

620
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,428
Nothing?

621
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,335
Don't you have any manners

622
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:12,907
facing me with your back?

623
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:15,306
So what do you want me to do?

624
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:17,841
lf l sit like this, my feet hits the table

625
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,914
This way l have to hold up the noodles
and face you

626
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,550
lt's unnatural and my hands are tired

627
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,813
So the dining table solves the problem,
doesn't it?

628
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:27,123
Actually it won't take more than
1 0 minutes to fill the stomach

629
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:28,754
Why bother with so many things?

630
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:32,224
You have to be conscious about your
mood too when you eat

631
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,490
lf the atmosphere is not good,
it affects the appetite

632
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:37,995
Most importantly

633
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:40,397
l never faced anything with my back

634
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:58,418
Did l wake you?

635
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,483
You take so many books to the room?

636
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,555
Can you finish them?

637
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:05,954
That's none of your business

638
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,155
You've to go back to the hospital
tomorrow, go to sleep quick

639
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,194
Did you clean up for me?

640
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,596
l have to count on you for my food
and lodging now

641
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,431
l ought to help you clean up a bit

642
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:17,504
You won't be able to help me that way

643
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:20,072
Trust me, when you wake up
tomorrow morning

644
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:22,678
you would find the world more orderly

645
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:26,076
lf you're not satisfied, l'll revert
everything to its usual position

646
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:27,449
You don't have to

647
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:28,482
l do

648
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:29,585
l really said no

649
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:31,311
l really must

650
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:34,990
Okay

651
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:46,719
You are a bit late today

652
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,967
lf your girl friend needs some place
to stay

653
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:52,767
Would you let her stay at your place?

654
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:58,035
Even if l would she may not be willing
to stay at my place

655
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,276
So ... l guess l probably wouldn't

656
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,602
That's what l think too

657
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:03,574
That's why l let her stay

658
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:06,580
How come?

659
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,581
You say you understand people

660
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:12,848
l am sure you don't realize she is that ...

661
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:16,755
That ...

662
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,523
That what?

663
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,661
That interesting

664
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,594
Forget it, she hasn't many friends anyway

665
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,532
Help her as much as you can

666
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:29,432
That's true

667
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,871
l think she won't trouble you too long

668
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,278
That's true

669
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:38,545
l need not worry if you help her

670
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:43,313
Do you know that she loves to sing?

671
00:40:44,255 --> 00:40:45,483
l don't know

672
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,453
And she sings everyday, l'm sure you
don't know that

673
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,189
You understand people?

674
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,067
Thanks

675
00:40:58,569 --> 00:40:59,661
Dr Ching

676
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:03,238
That thing is not over yet, l still need
your help

677
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,509
But there is nothing else l can say

678
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,768
l have said what l have to say

679
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:09,003
Not you, l want to kook for
Yeung Ying-ming

680
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:11,175
He's not back, has he got to do with it?

681
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,450
That day at the ER

682
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:15,982
He was the one who took
the pregnant lady to lCU

683
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,278
So his opinion ...

684
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:20,480
#NAME?
the whole thing

685
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:21,555
Don't you fear scaring him?

686
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,816
l am more scared than he is

687
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,895
Sorry, l'm late

688
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:32,700
Never mind, there's still time

689
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,871
Caught by Kelvin to chat?

690
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:38,907
Yes

691
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:40,904
Big trouble?

692
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,639
Anyway l don't want anyone to be
in trouble because of me

693
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,784
More so, l don't want anyone to be hurt
because of me

694
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,878
Don't think too much

695
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:51,378
Just tell them clearly what you know
about the facts

696
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:55,851
You can't control who would be
in trouble or get hurt

697
00:41:57,895 --> 00:41:59,362
What would you do if you were l?

698
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:03,327
Why not ask what would l want
from you if l were S .Y.?

699
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,200
l want you to tell the truth

700
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:07,498
What would be the result?
Everyone would blame you

701
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:11,367
You don't trust S .Y.?

702
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,741
No, why wouldn't l?

703
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,269
Why not trust me?

704
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:18,607
lf one feels no shame

705
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:21,478
He wouldn't care what others have to say

706
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,590
Give you five minutes to get to work

707
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:34,829
To be honest, how much are you
drinking tonight?

708
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,633
Ask yourself, how much do you
want to drink?

709
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:39,793
l'll want to drink as much as you do

710
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,006
Why isn't Crystal here yet?

711
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:45,741
May be she is enjoying herself elsewhere

712
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,900
S he is cruel to herself

713
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,945
Last time she told me she had an affair
with the photographer

714
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:52,649
And now she can only drink alone

715
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,349
There are good and bad times

716
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:56,519
What do you want to tell me?

717
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:59,479
Nothing, you should be happy when
you come out to have fun

718
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:04,155
ls men's happiness always sex related?

719
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:05,662
What about you?

720
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:09,855
Do you mean we as women or just me?

721
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:12,625
l am only interested in you tonight

722
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:14,970
l want to go to the washroom

723
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:20,139
Just now ...

724
00:43:20,344 --> 00:43:21,504
Okay ... don't mention it

725
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:22,874
You must be out of luck tonight

726
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,069
What are you talking about?

727
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:27,812
l just saw a girl sitting on the floor
in the washroom

728
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,776
Looks like she's in the same field as you

729
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,689
What? You feeling sick?

730
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,193
l'm okay ...

731
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,995
ls my face alright?

732
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,093
What happened?

733
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,527
Nothing

734
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,101
lf l were you, l'd take a rest

735
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:53,400
Why did you follow me?

736
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:55,744
Are you happy today?

737
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,637
Can you leave me alone?

738
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,228
l never thought you could get that wild

739
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:15,264
Don't think that just because l smoked
your cigarette ...

740
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:16,695
#NAME?

741
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:19,228
l tell you now, definitely not

742
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:21,536
So what happened?

743
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:25,040
Why do you men ...

744
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,805
Think so easily that a woman ...

745
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:30,175
S itting with a man drinking and
chatting ...

746
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:32,343
Could then sleep with him?

747
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:35,185
l don't know about other men

748
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:37,854
The women l met, sometimes don't
even need a drink

749
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,820
Did someone hit you?

750
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:47,260
You want me to accompany
to call the police?

751
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,367
That's right, that's not your first time

752
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:52,862
You still think it's very funny

753
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:54,628
Do you know your are very disgusting?

754
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,067
More disgusting than the one
who hit you?

755
00:44:56,874 --> 00:44:58,671
Please stop following me, can you?

756
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,434
Can you drive?

757
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:01,805
None of your business!

758
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,409
The food is ready

759
00:45:09,987 --> 00:45:11,978
What food? Did you cook?

760
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:14,118
lt's my turn

761
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:22,859
Have you ever stayed in a hotel?

762
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:24,592
Are you being sarcastic again?

763
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:29,632
You must be a person who likes to move
the hotel furniture around

764
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:33,267
Be honest, don't you feel more
comfortable?

765
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:34,637
l am correct

766
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:37,279
After such a big operation, you still end
up having instant noodles

767
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:39,114
l will have a good appetite

768
00:45:41,986 --> 00:45:43,681
l can cook well

769
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,219
There's just nothing for me to cook here

770
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,617
But don't worry, l'll solve this problem
for you

771
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,894
Please inform me first next time
you think of anything

772
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,290
Because there is not much food to eat ...

773
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:56,129
#NAME?

774
00:46:17,154 --> 00:46:18,815
ls it your habit to shout at people?

775
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,516
Look what you've done?

776
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:28,287
What have l done?

777
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:32,030
Please. Be good

778
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:34,602
l had such a hard time cleaning up

779
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:36,466
lt's not like the past now

780
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:41,871
You must understand

781
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,047
everyone has his own living habits

782
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:47,778
What you think is messy to me may be ...

783
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:49,784
Another kind of order

784
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:53,114
l have been used to this kind of order
you call mess a long time

785
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,384
lt's difficult to cope with your kind of '''
order in a short time

786
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:58,224
l want you to understand too

787
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,760
Let's forget about messy or not first

788
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,259
l don't think your place is particularly
orderly now

789
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,228
l still think it a bit messy

790
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:08,432
Just like this sofa

791
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:11,200
if l may l would not put it here

792
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,141
So how long do you plan to stay here?

793
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:20,374
That's not important

794
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:22,380
l think that you, as a doctor

795
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,679
S hould have an orderly life

796
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,885
You should live in a clean place

797
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:32,353
l understand that it is difficult for you to
adapt in a short time

798
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,127
l'll give you time, don't worry

799
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:06,253
Hello!

800
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:07,724
You didn't think it would be me?

801
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:09,723
What do you want?

802
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:11,925
l have been busy this morning, l don't
have breakfast to serve you

803
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:15,002
You eat two eggs before you go out

804
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:18,968
Why don't you speak?

805
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:31,916
How come you have so much time?

806
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,887
l did a lot of things today

807
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,222
You don't have do so much for me

808
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:40,255
l sit in it too

809
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:42,793
l feel happier if it looks more handsome

810
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:49,765
You don't have to do that

811
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:52,175
lt's for you

812
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,044
You know, you always hit your car

813
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:57,243
That can secure your safety

814
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:00,109
And see how pretty this essence looks

815
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:01,512
lf you put it there, you would feel happier

816
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,921
What are you doing?

817
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:09,819
lt took me a lot of trouble to find it

818
00:49:09,994 --> 00:49:11,291
Please show some due respect

819
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:19,930
l think we both got it wrong

820
00:49:20,204 --> 00:49:22,229
lt's not Jackie who needs to be
taken care of

821
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:23,903
lt's my car

822
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:28,244
l just want to tell you, your car
looks cool

823
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:30,243
lf not for your previous relationship
with her

824
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:31,711
l wouldn't have ended up like this

825
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:33,575
Don't say such things

826
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,719
Good friends can become enemies too

827
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,414
l find that you still lack a bit of sense
of humour

828
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,818
lf you get along with her more

829
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:42,185
l'm sure you would progress

830
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:44,952
Just right, time for a fight

831
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,187
Go away!

832
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:52,800
ls it really locked?

833
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,272
Jessinta can't do anything else

834
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:58,998
her best dish is fried crab

835
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:04,008
That's really nice

836
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:10,213
What are you up to now?

837
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:13,185
Jessinta saw me for less than 4 hours
today

838
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:14,255
and she already knows l am not well

839
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:16,584
You're a doctor, can't you feel
l am not well?

840
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:19,195
l only know you look angry

841
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:21,731
l have a toothache, it's been bothering
me for a whole day

842
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,024
And you ask me to eat crab?

843
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:24,393
Why don't you go to the dentist then?

844
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:26,963
lt's no use losing your temper,
l can't help you

845
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,938
lt's so late now, where can l find
a dentist?

846
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:30,539
l am hungry and l can't eat this

847
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:31,697
What should l do?

848
00:50:32,009 --> 00:50:33,499
You go to the dentist tomorrow
morning then

849
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,301
l'll fry two eggs for you now

850
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,007
Now what?

851
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:40,813
l'll fry the eggs myself

852
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:42,416
You eat your fried crab

853
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:50,725
lf you can't bite, you cook some
crab congee

854
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:52,327
Are you crazy?

855
00:50:57,234 --> 00:50:59,361
So you are really crazy

856
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:01,970
You are crazy, laughing in front
of the fridge

857
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:03,639
You can be quite humorous

858
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:04,999
l don't know what you are talking about

859
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:09,205
Can you eat the crab now?

860
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,407
lt's not hurting now, is that okay?

861
00:51:12,015 --> 00:51:13,482
l have been infected lately

862
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:15,376
l love to draw on round objects

863
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:17,781
Say that again

864
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:19,818
l just found your two kneecaps as
my new objects

865
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:27,220
What did you do to my toothpaste?

866
00:51:27,865 --> 00:51:28,957
To scrub the pan

867
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:32,532
Do you know how much dirt
your pan has?

868
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:34,261
l scrubbed for half a day

869
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:36,036
Really?

870
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,774
You bet, l don't know what your
toothpaste is

871
00:51:38,909 --> 00:51:40,069
lt can't clean the dirt

872
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:42,212
My hand still hurts from the scrubbing

873
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:44,444
The toothpaste is used for brushing teeth

874
00:51:44,782 --> 00:51:47,649
Who told you to use the toothpaste
to scrub a pan?

875
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:49,808
Do you know that l don't have any
toothpaste to use now?

876
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:52,817
l have half, you can use it

877
00:51:53,891 --> 00:51:55,256
l have nothing to say

878
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,386
You're so fierce, l'll buy one for you

879
00:51:58,562 --> 00:51:59,722
l'll buy it myself

880
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:14,042
l've been watching you for a long time

881
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,404
You don't do that when you buy things
from the supermarket

882
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:22,044
See, it's a fleeting pleasure

883
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:24,286
You don't have to buy that much if even
gives you a fleeting pleasure

884
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:25,649
You won't finish it in a year

885
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:27,251
Come on, watch over for me

886
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,483
l still have something to buy

887
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:32,762
Buy toothpaste

888
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:46,606
The toothpaste is over there

889
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:48,972
Would you consider?

890
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,075
ls that your business?

891
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,245
l think you would look nice wearing this

892
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,283
l don't think l will wear it for you to see

893
00:52:58,388 --> 00:52:59,412
Forget it

894
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:02,118
You would be grateful in future

895
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:25,306
Where's my toothpaste

896
00:53:25,682 --> 00:53:27,673
lt's there, look for it

897
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,550
No

898
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,090
lt's here

899
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:42,097
This is yours, where's mine?

900
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:44,126
Don't you like this one?

901
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,301
Don't tell me you only bought this one

902
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,871
No, l have this one

903
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:56,342
l said my gums are sensitive,
l can't use normal toothpaste

904
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:58,014
You're a doctor

905
00:53:58,181 --> 00:53:59,842
Can't you take some medicine?

906
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:03,782
You're insensitive to everything,
except your gums are sensitive

907
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:05,886
l have no time to discuss the medication
issue with you

908
00:54:06,056 --> 00:54:07,546
l only want to know
where my toothpaste is

909
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:09,792
Then ... we'll go buy it again

910
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:11,017
We again?

911
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:14,153
l fear l might get it wrong

912
00:54:27,578 --> 00:54:28,772
What are you doing?

913
00:54:29,112 --> 00:54:30,272
Come in

914
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:34,981
You are in a bigger hurry than me,
you want to try it now?

915
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,015
No rush yet, come out and see

916
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,248
Haven't l seen it just now?
What's there left to see?

917
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:44,684
Cup noodles and instant noodles are here

918
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:49,295
Here are the snacks, biscuits and
canned food

919
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,427
Here are the spices

920
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:53,259
Here are the spring water

921
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,201
Your personal stuff, you put it yourself

922
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:04,170
This looks more like a real home now

923
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:08,117
Not only like a home, it's become
your home already

924
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:11,319
That's exaggerating

925
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:13,453
Later the security manager will call you
Mrs Ching

926
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:16,486
l warn you, don't tease me

927
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:19,126
l'll take a bath

928
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:52,523
Turn around

929
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:53,985
What are you doing?

930
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:56,495
l said you would look nice wearing this

931
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,668
Don't you have manners?
Coming in without knocking?

932
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,766
You look great

933
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:02,201
Get out! Get out!

934
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:03,566
Why do you have to be so fierce!

935
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:12,379
Great?

936
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:15,214
Almost forgot ...

937
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:16,283
You're here again?

938
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,885
l want to borrow some shampoo

939
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:19,579
Wait, l'll get it for you in a minute

940
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:21,315
No need to look

941
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,459
Add a tie, you can go to a banquet

942
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:38,569
There's nothing to feel troubled about

943
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:42,844
Either you tell the truth or you lie

944
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:44,843
Do you still have another way
to handle this?

945
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,049
l said it

946
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:49,913
What did you say?

947
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:54,624
l think the fact that S .Y. is suspected of
being prejudiced against the robber ...

948
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:56,523
#NAME?

949
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:00,760
lf you really suspect S .Y.

950
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:02,228
Even if we don't agree ...

951
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,134
l believe they would respect your opinion

952
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:09,369
Lately a lot of people do think S .Y.
has a problem

953
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:12,907
So you said what everyone felt
was the truth

954
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:14,604
l didn't

955
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:16,740
Even you don't trust me?

956
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,245
lt's not that l don't believe you

957
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:23,816
Trust is based on understanding

958
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:26,688
And understanding takes a long time

959
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,019
Although we've only been together
for 2 months

960
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:31,386
l feel you are quite ...

961
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:33,457
... interesting ...

962
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,025
#NAME?

963
00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:36,663
But l don't really understand you

964
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:40,800
Would you feel ...

965
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:44,268
... feel that l ...

966
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,303
Don't have my own views?

967
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,707
lf you don't you wouldn't ask

968
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:52,008
Anyway ...

969
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,077
We will respect your views

970
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:20,340
Waiting for your ex-girlfriend's secret
call again?

971
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,904
l remembered something

972
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:24,347
lt might help me find that secret guy

973
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:26,881
How? l don't have any information

974
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,280
l don't even know who called

975
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,316
l have heard that telephone message ...

976
00:58:32,622 --> 00:58:33,987
How can you do that?

977
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,250
You listen to me first

978
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:39,256
Do you realize that every time he calls ...

979
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:41,396
The background is noisy and
there is music

980
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:43,559
l know

981
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:45,667
That must be a disco or a pub

982
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:47,593
Do you know which one then?

983
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:49,664
You know?

984
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,239
Yes, l know

985
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,905
May be you have not noticed

986
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,812
The two times he called

987
00:58:57,214 --> 00:58:59,614
The DJ was talking

988
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,884
l am familiar with that voice

989
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:03,713
l think l know where l can find him

990
00:59:04,554 --> 00:59:06,886
Hope you guys enjoy the music

991
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:09,182
So, should you be thankful to me?

992
00:59:10,493 --> 00:59:11,482
What do we do now?

993
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,291
Find a place first

994
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:17,124
May l help you two?

995
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:20,032
Please ask a male to come over

996
00:59:21,638 --> 00:59:22,969
Just a minute

997
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,605
l am afraid they might call the police

998
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,342
Of course not

999
00:59:28,612 --> 00:59:29,636
What would you like to order?

1000
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:31,905
Can you say that again?

1001
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:33,273
What would you like to order?

1002
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,984
Can you ask another male to come over?

1003
00:59:36,453 --> 00:59:38,421
S he is joking, 2 glasses of red
wine please

1004
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:39,579
Yes

1005
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:42,083
You are really scared?

1006
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:44,292
Let's find out ourselves

1007
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,652
We can't just stand here

1008
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:50,731
Could it be that one?

1009
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,372
ls this called a man's pride?

1010
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,670
You have to look for the most
handsome one here

1011
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,038
Red wine for you two

1012
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:08,241
Thank you

1013
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:09,816
Look

1014
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:50,222
What are you doing here?

1015
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,462
Who's that lady you are getting along
so well with?

1016
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:57,060
Don't you have any place to go?

1017
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:58,691
Can we go now?

1018
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:04,135
You don't want to know what happened
to your girlfriend?

1019
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:08,343
You are great, it's half bent

1020
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:09,906
l really don't want to know now

1021
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:13,248
Sometimes there are a lot of things ...

1022
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:15,709
Which you don't want your closest
friend to know

1023
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:17,876
lt may not be because we have
betrayed them

1024
01:01:19,356 --> 01:01:21,790
May be we are just afraid it would hurt
them more if they know

1025
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:25,588
Anyway, we can have a lot of reasons ...

1026
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:27,794
for hiding so many things

1027
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,294
Do you understand what l am saying?

1028
01:01:31,768 --> 01:01:33,736
l do, but ...

1029
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:35,336
lf she does not want me to know

1030
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:38,764
S he must have her reasons,
l shouldn't ask so much

1031
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:42,243
l should let you know what l did

1032
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,447
That guy just now is called Ronald

1033
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:46,814
He also knows your ex-girlfriend

1034
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,985
But it is Kenneth who is dating
your girlfriend

1035
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,921
Ronald gave me Kenneth's number

1036
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:54,718
lt's here

1037
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:56,590
lf you want to know ...

1038
01:01:57,027 --> 01:01:58,324
Give him a call

1039
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,536
What are you doing?

1040
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:13,809
What do you mean?

1041
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:20,477
You can really let go?

1042
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:25,183
After all this effort ...

1043
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:27,619
lt's a pity to burn it

1044
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:30,415
Not really, l have straightened out
my thinking

1045
01:02:31,728 --> 01:02:33,958
But it doesn't matter if you regret it

1046
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:36,126
l remember the number

1047
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:40,362
You are great

1048
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:41,865
l was just away for a while

1049
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:44,370
And you have women chasing after you

1050
01:02:44,908 --> 01:02:47,172
l'm used to it, it's been like that
since l was small

1051
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,248
You come all the way in the middle
of the night just to scare me?

1052
01:02:56,853 --> 01:02:58,411
You are so late too?

1053
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:00,482
What did you say?

1054
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:05,352
They are all saying, you and Jackie ...

1055
01:03:05,995 --> 01:03:07,758
Sounds funny

1056
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:10,024
You testing me?

1057
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:12,458
Just regard me as being curious

1058
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:14,196
Come on

1059
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:15,961
Don't be curious about this

1060
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:17,163
You are telling everyone

1061
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,566
you still feel for Jackie

1062
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:20,241
just depends on whether l have
anything to do with her

1063
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,204
So do you?

1064
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:24,871
l am disappointed with you

1065
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:30,814
Not now, but may be in future

1066
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:32,984
Future? l may have something to do
with you in future

1067
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,355
Actually, l just want to tell you

1068
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,188
l don't care whether what the people
say is true or not

1069
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:41,489
l don't mind

1070
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:44,057
Don't talk to me about this, buddy

1071
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:45,666
Go tell everyone

1072
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:47,200
What can there be between Jackie
and me?

1073
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:49,502
Things are never absolute

1074
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,134
You're early

1075
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:57,173
l'm used to it, it's not that early

1076
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:05,479
You seemed to be back quite late
last night

1077
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:09,582
What time were you back?

1078
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,857
l don't remember

1079
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:13,894
May be 1 :00 a.m

1080
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,660
l thought you didn't have any friends
except Paul

1081
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:21,666
They were all ex-colleagues

1082
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:24,332
Thanks

1083
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:27,307
You're not eating?

1084
01:04:27,544 --> 01:04:28,511
l have eaten already

1085
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:30,875
They even found a job for me

1086
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:32,111
Really?

1087
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:34,307
Where are you going?

1088
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:37,042
l don't know how to use knife and fork
to eat macaroni

1089
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:39,781
Sorry, wait a second

1090
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:46,186
What kind of job?

1091
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:48,890
ln an accountants' firm

1092
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:51,465
Thanks

1093
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:54,329
When do you start work?

1094
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:55,697
Next week

1095
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:58,437
l have good news for you

1096
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:00,302
What?

1097
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,568
l found a place to move at last

1098
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:05,605
Really?

1099
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:07,473
When will?

1100
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:09,582
Soon

1101
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:14,422
l thought you would laugh

1102
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:16,353
l will

1103
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:18,493
l'll laugh when you are really gone

1104
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:22,125
So l think l should buy you a meal

1105
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,124
Breakfast doesn't count?

1106
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:29,198
We have to go to a high-class restaurant
with good food ...

1107
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:30,633
Where you pay a lot of tips

1108
01:05:31,975 --> 01:05:34,136
S ince you have been Jessinta, you
haven't broken my underpants

1109
01:05:34,744 --> 01:05:36,177
l should buy you a meal

1110
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,313
That's alright too, where do you
want to go?

1111
01:05:39,682 --> 01:05:41,172
Are you dating me?

1112
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:44,551
Just a meal, does that count as a date?

1113
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:46,680
lf that's not a date, what is?

1114
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:51,516
Dating should be done by men

1115
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:54,760
lf you are good, you don't need me

1116
01:06:03,573 --> 01:06:04,505
You're leaving?

1117
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:05,503
How about dinner together?

1118
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:06,831
l am having dinner with a friend

1119
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:08,975
Next time then

1120
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:19,846
l am seeing Jackie

1121
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:21,781
You aren't off yet?

1122
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:29,857
You don't have to tell me who you are
going out with

1123
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:40,965
Have you anything to say to me?

1124
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:46,310
Actually, l ...

1125
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:51,548
l don't want you to leave

1126
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:53,820
l want you to stay

1127
01:06:56,392 --> 01:06:57,950
lf l don't see you when l come home

1128
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:01,420
l think l will be very depressed

1129
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:09,803
How does that sound?

1130
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:17,974
l know there will be other people
saying these things to me

1131
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:21,149
But they will be more sincere

1132
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:22,810
You wait and see

1133
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:30,887
Having lived here for so long

1134
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:32,919
l have never taken anyone for
a walk here

1135
01:07:36,232 --> 01:07:38,097
l really miss this

1136
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:43,038
What do you think l miss?

1137
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,566
Probably me

1138
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,568
A little bit

1139
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:52,779
But l miss the place here more

1140
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:02,286
lf you miss it, do something.

1141
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,527
That's why ... l want to take a walk here

1142
01:08:10,933 --> 01:08:12,059
What about me?

1143
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:20,767
l only miss you a bit

1144
01:08:21,778 --> 01:08:23,837
What do you think l should do?

1145
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:31,578
Do you think l am troublesome?

1146
01:08:33,022 --> 01:08:34,421
You used to be

1147
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:39,923
Would you treat me as your
good friend now?

1148
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:42,823
You don't treat someone as a good friend

1149
01:08:43,099 --> 01:08:44,532
Either you are or you are not

1150
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:46,430
So, am l or am l not?

1151
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:50,433
Yes or no?

1152
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,550
Still awake?

1153
01:09:01,751 --> 01:09:02,945
l have to pack

1154
01:09:03,186 --> 01:09:04,175
What are you looking for?

1155
01:09:04,387 --> 01:09:05,513
Do you know where the needle
and thread is?

1156
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:07,447
l have them, what do you want it for?

1157
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,150
Nothing

1158
01:09:09,692 --> 01:09:11,683
l cut myself while fixing
the cabinet door

1159
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:13,618
You're so careless

1160
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:18,900
Found it?

1161
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:25,568
Can You manage?

1162
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:28,710
Looks like the cut is very deep

1163
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:37,018
Look, you know how to do
a brain surgery

1164
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,154
and you can't even pick a thorn out

1165
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:41,983
Let me help you

1166
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:08,342
Sorry

1167
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:10,811
l'm okay

1168
01:10:16,559 --> 01:10:17,719
Okay

1169
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:19,855
Thanks

1170
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:29,400
Need to put some medication on?

1171
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:32,736
No

1172
01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:35,004
lt seems l still haven't told you

1173
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:36,337
whether we are good friends

1174
01:10:37,013 --> 01:10:38,173
Yes

1175
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:40,441
Of course we are

1176
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,178
But there are many kinds of good friends

1177
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:45,277
Which kind are we?

1178
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:48,323
l think it is ...

1179
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:50,852
The kind which, if you can't be my friend

1180
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:53,684
l would regret it

1181
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,896
l get it

1182
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:38,063
You can get even with this,
you are wonderful

1183
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:40,292
l have done my best

1184
01:12:41,037 --> 01:12:42,197
Yours?

1185
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:44,904
l haven't noticed in the past

1186
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:47,341
Can't l have a look?

1187
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:48,340
No

1188
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:49,739
You should say that earlier

1189
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:51,543
What's there to hide?

1190
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:52,840
Everyone has privacy, okay?

1191
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:56,277
You just have that much?

1192
01:12:56,652 --> 01:12:58,279
Yes, l just need to call a cab

1193
01:12:58,554 --> 01:12:59,885
You don't have to drive me there

1194
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:04,416
l didn't sleep well last night

1195
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:06,822
You have company

1196
01:13:07,663 --> 01:13:08,925
Don't you want to know why?

1197
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:12,659
l have heard too many insincere words

1198
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:15,101
Then shouldn't you do some
self-criticism?

1199
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:18,370
You insist on escorting me

1200
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:21,042
So that you can have some more time
to drive me mad?

1201
01:13:26,282 --> 01:13:28,182
lf you suddenly remember the
surroundings here in future

1202
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:32,177
and you miss it, would you ...

1203
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,455
come back and take a walk?

1204
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:39,121
l think ...

1205
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:41,388
l wouldn't

1206
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:48,364
There's a kind of people with
a strange charm

1207
01:13:48,938 --> 01:13:51,133
lt can influence you gradually

1208
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:58,704
Though l still cannot feel ...

1209
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:01,981
That kind of fleeting pleasure when
one buys unnecessary stuff

1210
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:04,652
l would even try it

1211
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:08,589
The conclusion is that it is irrelevant
to the charm

1212
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:10,915
Because something's has happened

1213
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:13,318
The problem is ...

1214
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:15,453
When can we convince ourselves
to accept it

1215
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:36,471
Still awake?

1216
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:39,338
Am l your youngest patient?

1217
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,640
You have been thinking about this
all night?

1218
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:46,620
l am young, and energetic

1219
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:48,219
l'm even studying medicine

1220
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:52,052
May be l'll be a good doctor in future

1221
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:55,558
Now l have AVM, would you feel sorry
for me?

1222
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,400
Every patient has his own story

1223
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:04,635
You can't say who shouldn't have
what kind of disease

1224
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:08,970
So that's not a question of being sorry,
understand?

1225
01:16:10,512 --> 01:16:13,413
My family loves me and l love them

1226
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:17,710
They can give up anything to cure
my disease

1227
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,284
l don't want to see them take
so much pain

1228
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:22,155
lf you know they love you

1229
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:24,784
you should take good care of yourself

1230
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:30,860
Go to sleep

1231
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:21,273
You're off today?

1232
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:24,284
You don't look well, you're okay?

1233
01:17:24,586 --> 01:17:26,178
l'm fine, just a toothache

1234
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:28,216
Did you go to the dentist?

1235
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:30,149
lt's okay

1236
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:32,551
lf someone can make me laugh ...

1237
01:17:32,828 --> 01:17:34,159
l'll be fine

1238
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,320
Mom, l dropped my ball

1239
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:38,229
No! lt's dangerous!

1240
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,692
l'm going

1241
01:17:42,972 --> 01:17:44,599
Look out! Be careful!

1242
01:17:53,182 --> 01:17:55,116
The miss picked up the ball for you

1243
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:56,751
Thank you, miss

1244
01:17:56,986 --> 01:17:58,112
Thank you. Are you okay?

1245
01:17:58,287 --> 01:17:59,584
l'm fine

1246
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:00,984
Okay, bye

1247
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:19,600
Jackie!

1248
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:20,866
S it down first

1249
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,210
Somebody, help!

1250
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,403
Help!

1251
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:35,250
Please, call the ambulance

1252
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:37,750
Yan Ping Road, Causeway Bay ...

1253
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:49,336
What do you want?

1254
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,801
l can still manage to get a glass of water

1255
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:54,505
Let me help you

1256
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,942
By the way, when can l leave?

1257
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:05,679
lsn't it comfortable here?

1258
01:19:05,921 --> 01:19:07,513
l have stayed here for so long

1259
01:19:07,756 --> 01:19:09,883
Even if l have to live in the streets

1260
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:11,117
l wouldn't want to come back

1261
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:14,620
You can go after the CT-brain

1262
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:17,564
l just shed two drops of nose blood,
it's nothing

1263
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,789
Two drops?

1264
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:20,801
You bled all over

1265
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:24,403
l have been suffering from toothache

1266
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,176
And didn't sleep well, it's because
my internal heat is rising

1267
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:29,569
l'm fine really

1268
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,006
We won't keep you too long

1269
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:34,181
You understand?

1270
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,348
God would not be too cruel to me

1271
01:19:37,586 --> 01:19:39,178
l wouldn't be that out of luck

1272
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:42,891
lf l didn't die last time, l'll be okay
this time

1273
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:47,822
You don't believe it? Take a bet

1274
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,055
Don't make fun of your own health

1275
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:51,929
What if l win?

1276
01:19:55,904 --> 01:19:57,064
You'd better be careful

1277
01:19:57,306 --> 01:20:00,503
l would if l am sick, but l am not

1278
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:02,243
Don't think as if you are a doctor

1279
01:20:03,078 --> 01:20:04,545
lf anything happens it would be
dangerous

1280
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:08,248
Anyway, l don't want to do the CT-brain

1281
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:39,906
You still haven't left at this hour?

1282
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,319
lt's Jackie's

1283
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:01,563
lt's AVM

1284
01:21:05,507 --> 01:21:06,906
lt's too unfair for her

1285
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:12,974
A criminal can start a new life after
serving his sentence

1286
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:17,678
Why can't she have one more chance?

1287
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:22,022
There is still something we can do

1288
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,056
Look carefully

1289
01:21:26,361 --> 01:21:27,760
Even if l do this surgery

1290
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,460
l am not sure if l can help her

1291
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:35,660
Have you thought about how to tell her?

1292
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:39,935
Tell the truth

1293
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:44,939
Tell her she could die any moment

1294
01:21:45,581 --> 01:21:47,105
no one can help her?

1295
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,077
Sometimes l really admire you

1296
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:54,446
There are a lot of things which you can
do and l can't

1297
01:21:55,023 --> 01:21:56,217
What if l can?

1298
01:21:59,061 --> 01:22:00,585
lt doesn't make a difference how l tell her

1299
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,927
The truth is the truth

1300
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:07,434
Everyone is the same

1301
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:09,499
You can also tell me that l may die
any moment

1302
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:11,800
Who knows what will happen in
the next minute?

1303
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:15,541
May be a van hits over and we will
all be dead

1304
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,081
How long since you have been
that troubled?

1305
01:22:27,556 --> 01:22:28,682
Remember the last time ...

1306
01:22:28,924 --> 01:22:31,620
Who and what are you troubled with?

1307
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:34,722
Good, looks like it's a person

1308
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:38,088
lt's a good thing

1309
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,406
So ...

1310
01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:54,681
Even l couldn't do this ...

1311
01:22:55,484 --> 01:22:56,849
Telling the one we love

1312
01:22:57,419 --> 01:22:59,284
about such a cruel fact

1313
01:23:01,256 --> 01:23:02,848
needs great courage

1314
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:08,562
May be more than telling her ...

1315
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:11,755
How much l need her

1316
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:35,256
Where are you?

1317
01:23:37,693 --> 01:23:38,955
Can you do me a favour?

1318
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:44,955
l drank too much and can't drive

1319
01:23:45,334 --> 01:23:47,666
Can you come out and take me home?

1320
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,686
You can't drink, so don't drink so much

1321
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:15,454
How's it? Where's the car key?

1322
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:17,925
How are you doing?

1323
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:20,664
You seem to have drunk more than l have

1324
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:22,297
How can you drive?

1325
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:24,328
l can

1326
01:24:24,973 --> 01:24:27,168
l really can

1327
01:24:28,076 --> 01:24:29,839
Give me the key

1328
01:24:30,412 --> 01:24:31,538
Don't

1329
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:35,180
Take a rest in the car

1330
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:38,809
No need to look after me

1331
01:24:39,087 --> 01:24:40,987
l'm really okay

1332
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:54,800
What's so happy about tonight?

1333
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:56,728
You drank so much?

1334
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:01,175
A lot happened

1335
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:04,375
l don't know if it's happy ...

1336
01:25:04,613 --> 01:25:06,376
or unhappy ...

1337
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:10,375
What about you?

1338
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,280
Why did you drink so much too?

1339
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:21,594
l lied to a good friend

1340
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,331
What kind of good friend?

1341
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:29,236
Like you and me ...

1342
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:32,332
or another kind?

1343
01:25:36,745 --> 01:25:38,110
You are honest

1344
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,743
At least you admit you lied

1345
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:47,582
What's up?

1346
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:52,526
Why did you lie to your good friend?

1347
01:25:54,062 --> 01:25:55,222
l said it before

1348
01:25:56,665 --> 01:25:57,927
there must be a reason ...

1349
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:00,328
for hiding things

1350
01:26:03,905 --> 01:26:06,669
You never treated your patients like
this in the past

1351
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:14,147
Patients are another matter

1352
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:20,644
Why do you do this to me?

1353
01:26:24,426 --> 01:26:25,723
What do you know?

1354
01:26:29,364 --> 01:26:30,626
l think ...

1355
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:32,967
everything which l ought not know ...

1356
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:34,396
l know already

1357
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:40,768
You are afraid l would be unhappy
if l knew

1358
01:26:42,811 --> 01:26:44,108
so you lied to me

1359
01:26:46,114 --> 01:26:47,342
l would be happy

1360
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:56,917
lt's not worth it

1361
01:27:05,901 --> 01:27:07,198
l lost

1362
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:15,673
The heavens ...

1363
01:27:16,878 --> 01:27:18,470
can really be very cruel

1364
01:27:19,047 --> 01:27:20,742
Time and time again ...

1365
01:27:49,678 --> 01:27:52,545
l thought l would be lucky

1366
01:28:23,945 --> 01:28:26,641
So it may not be a good thing to have
another chance

1367
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:32,310
the result would only hurt you one
more time

1368
01:28:37,092 --> 01:28:38,719
The problem l have to face ...

1369
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:41,256
is the same as yours

1370
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,172
Why are you so late?

1371
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:28,001
This came so sudden, l have things
to do too

1372
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:29,040
What do we do now?

1373
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:30,541
The deceased's family are all over there

1374
01:29:30,812 --> 01:29:31,870
They have decided not to proceed

1375
01:29:32,213 --> 01:29:32,907
Let's talk inside

1376
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:33,979
Okay

1377
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,611
Sorry for interrupting at this hour

1378
01:29:37,919 --> 01:29:38,749
Never mind

1379
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:40,085
What's the position now?

1380
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:44,153
They are very reasonable

1381
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,656
so the problem has been solved

1382
01:29:47,195 --> 01:29:48,890
l wanted to get back justice

1383
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:51,531
But my husband is dead already, it's no
use how much you pay me

1384
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:53,825
S ince you have apologized, l don't want
any more trouble

1385
01:29:54,135 --> 01:29:56,501
Mrs Wong is very understanding

1386
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:58,939
Excuse me, l have some important
things to do

1387
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:01,232
l won't see you out

1388
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:02,634
Let's go

1389
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:07,438
We may not lose this case

1390
01:30:08,249 --> 01:30:09,682
Some people ...

1391
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:12,546
choose to use the simplest method
to solve their problems

1392
01:30:13,521 --> 01:30:14,852
What about dignity?

1393
01:30:15,523 --> 01:30:17,889
This may not be important to
a lot of people

1394
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:20,194
l am very sorry this time

1395
01:30:20,595 --> 01:30:21,960
Never mind, l'm going

1396
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:23,722
Thank you

1397
01:30:31,906 --> 01:30:32,964
Forget it, sister

1398
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:34,800
so long as we have accounted for
this with brother, that's it

1399
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:36,808
You so back first

1400
01:30:37,011 --> 01:30:37,807
Thank you

1401
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:39,669
Thanks, goodbye

1402
01:30:43,084 --> 01:30:44,642
You have a lot of friends

1403
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:46,381
They need to discuss something with me

1404
01:30:47,021 --> 01:30:48,545
l have no reason not to let them have
my views

1405
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:51,248
Are you helping me then?

1406
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:53,354
What psychological problem
do you have?

1407
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:55,118
You like to put on acts so much

1408
01:30:55,663 --> 01:30:57,130
You don't seem to need help

1409
01:30:57,999 --> 01:31:00,024
lf you think that one can put on an act
whether it's for good or bad

1410
01:31:00,268 --> 01:31:01,997
then it's you who has a psychological
problem

1411
01:31:13,414 --> 01:31:14,381
lt's me

1412
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:16,680
Sorry, l was busy just now and
couldn't call

1413
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:19,779
Okay, l'll wait for you here

1414
01:31:20,455 --> 01:31:21,752
Call me when you are here

1415
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:44,856
Jackie!

1416
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:46,122
S ir, you know her?

1417
01:33:46,367 --> 01:33:47,561
S he is my friend, what happened?

1418
01:33:48,803 --> 01:33:50,361
l don't know, she suddenly fainted

1419
01:33:50,571 --> 01:33:51,663
l called the police for you

1420
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,372
Don't worry, you'll be fine

1421
01:34:00,548 --> 01:34:02,243
Don't be scared, it will be alright

1422
01:34:05,486 --> 01:34:09,217
Jackie ...

1423
01:34:11,192 --> 01:34:12,454
Do you know where you are?

1424
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:16,123
Am l in the hospital?

1425
01:34:16,564 --> 01:34:17,496
Right

1426
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:20,800
Can you move your hands and legs?
Any pain in the neck?

1427
01:34:24,072 --> 01:34:25,232
l can move

1428
01:34:48,629 --> 01:34:49,789
Can't l leave?

1429
01:34:52,467 --> 01:34:55,163
l want to give you something,
hope you like it

1430
01:34:57,171 --> 01:35:00,402
lf it is a ring, the box seems a bit too big

1431
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:05,611
lf you would take our advice and do
the surgery

1432
01:35:08,016 --> 01:35:09,415
This present would be most suitable

1433
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:11,813
So if l take your present

1434
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:14,051
l'll have to let you open up my brain

1435
01:35:14,822 --> 01:35:16,517
What's so precious you have?

1436
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:19,521
Open it

1437
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:33,870
My hair is much more beautiful than this

1438
01:35:35,209 --> 01:35:36,574
lf you can get back your life

1439
01:35:39,013 --> 01:35:40,446
Just put up with this for the time being

1440
01:35:44,986 --> 01:35:47,284
Actually, l feel happy about something

1441
01:35:48,089 --> 01:35:49,215
Which is ...

1442
01:35:49,824 --> 01:35:52,418
You never had a chance to see my ugly
looks before

1443
01:35:53,828 --> 01:35:56,319
So if you want me to become bald
headed ...

1444
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,121
You can open up my brain

1445
01:35:58,599 --> 01:36:00,396
l think there's a problem here

1446
01:36:05,973 --> 01:36:07,133
How about this?

1447
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:09,306
lf you would do the surgery ...

1448
01:36:10,545 --> 01:36:11,876
l'll wear this wig

1449
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:14,578
And let you see my ugly looks

1450
01:37:01,095 --> 01:37:03,290
Quit this mediocre talk

1451
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:06,696
Just one line

1452
01:37:07,802 --> 01:37:10,168
lmagine everything will be fine
when you wake up

1453
01:37:11,906 --> 01:37:13,168
Don't worry

1454
01:37:14,242 --> 01:37:16,369
l'll try to help you too

1455
01:37:21,482 --> 01:37:22,710
Now we'll inject the anesthetics

1456
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:55,467
Let's begin

1457
01:39:45,626 --> 01:39:48,117
Pulse 79, BP 90/1 40

1458
01:39:58,172 --> 01:39:59,196
Hemorrhage

1459
01:39:59,974 --> 01:40:01,532
S uction

1460
01:40:09,016 --> 01:40:11,644
Pulse 1 35, BP 30/70

1461
01:40:11,852 --> 01:40:12,978
More pressure, transfusion

1462
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,759
Continue

1463
01:40:30,771 --> 01:40:31,829
lf this continues

1464
01:40:32,139 --> 01:40:36,337
Her problem would become more
and more serious

1465
01:40:47,755 --> 01:40:50,485
Wrap the head, l couldn't do the surgery

1466
01:41:35,269 --> 01:41:36,668
Anything you want to tell me?

1467
01:41:40,207 --> 01:41:42,198
Seeing you being tortured by this disease

1468
01:41:44,311 --> 01:41:45,505
l feel hurt

1469
01:41:47,415 --> 01:41:49,042
You talk to me like that

1470
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:51,817
You know l am easily touched?

1471
01:41:57,224 --> 01:41:58,748
l have tried my best

1472
01:42:02,196 --> 01:42:03,493
But couldn't help you

1473
01:42:09,937 --> 01:42:11,336
Never mind

1474
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:14,936
Before the surgery ...

1475
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:19,076
l had thought l may never wake up
and see you.

1476
01:42:20,514 --> 01:42:24,712
Now l can see you and even chat
with you

1477
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:27,978
l should be happy

1478
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:31,086
Trust me, l'll never give up

1479
01:42:32,593 --> 01:42:34,117
Trust me too

1480
01:42:35,996 --> 01:42:37,987
lf l don't become too ugly ...

1481
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,300
l really don't mind

1482
01:42:49,243 --> 01:42:50,938
Whey isn't Dr Ching here?

1483
01:42:51,412 --> 01:42:53,471
Never mind, we can come back to
visit him later

1484
01:42:53,848 --> 01:42:54,780
Let's get a cab

1485
01:42:55,182 --> 01:42:57,480
We don't need to take a cab, a bus is fine

1486
01:43:11,098 --> 01:43:12,326
Has Ms Kong been looking for me?

1487
01:43:12,566 --> 01:43:14,557
Yes, l said you were not around

1488
01:43:14,969 --> 01:43:16,630
S he's waiting for you in the office

1489
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:18,065
Anything wrong?

1490
01:43:18,539 --> 01:43:19,665
S he has been discharged

1491
01:43:28,682 --> 01:43:30,206
lt also happened in a sudden

1492
01:43:31,185 --> 01:43:33,653
l don't know why, she decided to leave

1493
01:43:34,421 --> 01:43:36,616
Because she never gave me the chance
to find the answer

1494
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:11,884
l want to let you know, l have decided
to leave

1495
01:44:12,293 --> 01:44:14,420
Because l know that you have
no other solution

1496
01:44:19,767 --> 01:44:21,826
Nothing else you can do for me

1497
01:44:24,104 --> 01:44:25,765
Except for staying with me ...

1498
01:44:26,407 --> 01:44:27,738
And waiting for that day

1499
01:44:34,748 --> 01:44:35,908
You are different from me

1500
01:44:36,317 --> 01:44:38,751
You see the people you care
leave one by one

1501
01:44:39,353 --> 01:44:41,082
And you have to continue with your life

1502
01:44:42,222 --> 01:44:45,157
l can imagine it is a sad thing

1503
01:44:48,462 --> 01:44:50,828
Sometimes l think you are more
unfortunate than l am

1504
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,491
lf God wants me to leave this world

1505
01:44:56,437 --> 01:44:58,632
l know there is nothing l can do

1506
01:45:00,074 --> 01:45:01,632
But l wouldn't just give up

1507
01:45:02,876 --> 01:45:05,538
There was once a miracle that woke me

1508
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:10,381
l have confidence there would be
a second miracle

1509
01:45:20,327 --> 01:45:21,794
l don't know where she is now

1510
01:45:22,696 --> 01:45:23,856
But ...

1511
01:45:24,365 --> 01:45:26,162
l know if there is this day ...

1512
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,925
When she remembers all that has
happened here

1513
01:45:29,737 --> 01:45:31,068
Remembers ...

1514
01:45:31,972 --> 01:45:33,303
The surroundings she missed

1515
01:45:34,174 --> 01:45:36,768
l'm sure l'd still have a chance to see
her here
