1
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,272
( Hitler giving speech
in the distance )

2
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,240
( crowd cheering )

3
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,826
( speaking German )

4
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,740
( crowd cheers )

5
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,999
Before us
lies Germany,

6
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,635
within us
marches Germany,

7
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,576
and after us

8
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,580
comes Germany!

9
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,682
Hitler: At the extreme,
one becomes a symbol.

10
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,587
Every man
who desires adulation

11
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,927
will recognize in me
the pure manifestation

12
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,627
of that dark part
of himself.

13
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,967
l am the perfect reflection

14
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,098
of every man
with the lust to dominate,

15
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,609
who has some bias
or prejudice--

16
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,669
some unsatisfied craving.

17
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,615
Some will condemn me morally,
but they cannot escape

18
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,812
the power of my image.

19
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,619
Their self-righteousness
will dissolve,

20
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,387
as their hearts beat

21
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,895
with the rhythm of my essence.

22
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,124
Even those poor souls

23
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,633
who hate me
will privately envy me,

24
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,000
because l've fulfilled
my dreams,

25
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,801
whilst others repress

26
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,035
their true desires.

27
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,844
Thus, have l guaranteed
my immortality.

28
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,475
The essential Hitler
has a hold

29
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,678
over every human heart.

30
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,547
Does that sound
clichéd?

31
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:44,861
Anyway, let's end this
on a poetic note.

32
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,228
Will to power.

33
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,494
Will to form.

34
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,628
Will to beauty.

35
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,950
Look at the men, Goebbels.

36
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,145
Geometry.
Classic lines.

37
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,094
Nothing is more
important to me

38
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,926
than the preservation
of these images.

39
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,194
Power. Order.

40
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,293
Solemnity.

41
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,838
You know what l like most?

42
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,431
Your decision to break
the formation

43
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,534
here and here.

44
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,546
Not only does it
serve the composition,

45
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,812
but it gives the impression
of the Cross.

46
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,013
Hmmm. The Messiah theme.

47
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,825
Here it is.

48
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,294
Do you think l should have
walked down the aisle alone?

49
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,699
That's an interesting question.

50
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,531
My instinct was that
a loner would be viewed

51
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,231
- as less trustworthy.
- Goebbels: Hmmm.

52
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,434
Hitler: Better to be surrounded
by faithful lieutenants.

53
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,171
Goebbels:
Yes... l think so.

54
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,009
Those men, Goebbels,

55
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,312
what are they thinking?

56
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,344
A person wants to be a part
of something beyond his...

57
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,515
small self.

58
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,252
To escape.

59
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,294
To be lost

60
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,659
in a historic moment.

61
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,164
l wonder if their feet hurt.

62
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,168
You organized the people
on a whole new basis.

63
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,229
By invoking
Aryan superiority,

64
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,798
you enabled us
to transcend regional

65
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,673
and religious rivalries,

66
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,373
even trivial issues
of gender,

67
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,882
age, class distinctions.

68
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,182
l created a great
circulation of energy,

69
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,712
self-replicating,
self-reaffirming.

70
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,658
My God!

71
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,839
ln the First World War,

72
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,876
the Jews and the Bolsheviks

73
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,605
stabbed Germany
in the back.

74
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,807
Even as German blood spilled
in our just and noble cause,

75
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,613
the enemy within sought
to destroy us by treachery!

76
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,780
The bad within
must be extracted.

77
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,347
We must protect Germany!

78
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,689
l must save the motherland

79
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,922
from this defilement!

80
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,591
( coughing )

81
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,482
You could never understand
a man of will.

82
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,095
The problem with you Jews

83
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,825
is you think
you know so much--

84
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,164
the inside of a man,

85
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,069
this nonsense about

86
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,073
the ''id'' and ''superego.''

87
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,575
A man is the sum total
of his acts.

88
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,874
Success justifies all.

89
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,179
So, what can we learn
from your actions?

90
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:29,017
That a man is his own creation,
his own artwork.

91
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,353
To use only reason
is to close the door

92
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,222
to the power of an idea

93
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,818
like blood and soil.

94
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,955
Freud:
What of your inner world?

95
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,529
l know myself completely,
l know my personal myths.

96
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,832
That is enough.

97
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,542
With the answers
to 1,000 questions,

98
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,238
you and your kind
could not begin

99
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,281
to understand me.

100
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,085
Only a poet

101
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,086
could touch the edge

102
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,123
of the Führer mystery.

103
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,109
Where was l?

104
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,806
Ah, l remember now.

105
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,009
One power alone
makes a great leader--

106
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,485
imagination, divine vision.

107
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,649
l took those words
from someone.

108
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,216
l can't remember whom.

109
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,759
lt's good to be
writing again.

110
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,602
Film is the magician's mirror...

111
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,610
the first art form
which allows the artist

112
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,117
to project his dreams
and fantasies,

113
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,847
into the inner life
of the viewer,

114
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,186
to reshape
and capture his soul,

115
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,885
to create
a perfect reality

116
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,023
indelibly inscribed
on the minds of billions.

117
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,263
My works of destruction
and grandeur will live on.

118
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,702
l am the artist.

119
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,570
l am the artwork.

120
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,977
l was Homer.

121
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,609
l was Ulysses.

122
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,746
l was the Odyssey.

123
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,761
l enlisted powerful men,
courageous men,

124
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,229
to the task of fulfilling

125
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,597
my artistic destiny.

126
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,929
Your fairness cleanses me.

127
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,903
To make love to you,

128
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,601
is to make love
to all of Germany.

129
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,511
Eva: My Führer.

130
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,708
( Hitler whispers )
My angel.

131
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,317
Eva: Wolfie?

132
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,931
Eva: What?

133
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,057
l represented
the rejection of the modern.

134
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,999
What is it, Adolf?

135
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,833
A return to the world
of Homer,

136
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,533
in which war isn't

137
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,439
about massive destruction,

138
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,340
but remains
first and foremost...

139
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,883
an instrument--
( coughs )

140
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,322
to enhance
a hero's personal glory.

141
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,885
Hitler:
Modern art

142
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,625
is the enfevered fantasies

143
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,429
of an incurably sick people.

144
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,569
The fact that nine-tenths

145
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,133
of artistic rubbish--

146
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,736
literary filth,

147
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,339
theatrical idiocy--

148
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,478
can be traced to the account
of one people,

149
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,721
of all the country's
inhabitants

150
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:46,697
can simply not be
talked away.

151
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,061
lt is the plain truth.

152
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,635
The Jewish-Christian creed,
with its effeminate ethics

153
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,700
undermines our vitality.

154
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,746
Morality is a decay,

155
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,250
a blemish like
the Hebrew circumcision.

156
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,582
The German people must
learn to distrust reason,

157
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,919
the dirty and degrading
idea of conscience.

158
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,152
What number
was the last footnote?

159
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,095
28, mein Führer.

160
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,827
Footnote 29.

161
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,836
The Führer
wrote these words

162
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,736
for the first draft
of Mein Kampf,

163
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,639
the morning of May 2, 1924,

164
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,040
in Landsberg Prison.

165
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,151
ln other countries,

166
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:52,061
why do they keep
the German title Mein Kampf,

167
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,895
instead of translating it to...

168
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,425
My struggle?

169
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,276
Hitler: The sun...

170
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,281
is uncontrollable...

171
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,806
unforgiving.

172
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,013
With the sun,

173
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,147
you can't...

174
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:23,388
shape and sculpt reality.

175
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,624
l hate the sun.

176
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,856
There is magic
in enormity, my doctor--

177
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,290
overwhelming,
like a dominant father.

178
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,299
Yes, but...

179
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,999
the art is in disguising

180
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,807
the technique.

181
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,676
Brutality must be wrapped

182
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,511
in velvet.

183
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,813
That is what
distinguishes us

184
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,479
from say...

185
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,819
a thug like Stalin.

186
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,799
Hitler: Wagner made
the exorbitant demand

187
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,994
that the stage become
an hypnotic instrument

188
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,299
under the power
of the artist.

189
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,234
l impose the same demand
on Germany.

190
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,383
History is an error
to be rewritten

191
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,718
be the visionary
playwright.

192
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,928
While Wagner brought
the German myths

193
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,694
to the operatic stage,

194
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,669
l brought them
to the world.

195
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,907
l am the superman,

196
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,413
the Teutonic knight

197
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,473
on the quest
for the Holy Grail.

198
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,544
Compared to you,

199
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,988
Wagner was a minimalist.

200
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,899
Let's enter one more
into the record.

201
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,373
This is from April, 1935.

202
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,209
A woman from Berlin.

203
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,148
''My fervently adored Führer,

204
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,549
you have a birthday,

205
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,417
and we know
only two ardent wishes:

206
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,686
that everything
in our fatherland be,

207
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,523
now and in the future,
just as you want it to be,

208
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,758
and may God provide
that you be preserved

209
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,800
for us forever.

210
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,461
Your loyal, E.E.''

211
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,349
Just a minute.

212
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,624
l thought you said
our count was 5,700,000.

213
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,996
They're using
the 6-million figure.

214
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,762
( Hitler mumbles )
Typical.

215
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,360
A clever exaggeration.

216
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,702
Well, all right, Goering,
let's use those figures.

217
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,676
Suits us. History likes
round numbers.

218
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,872
Now, the war total

219
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,316
was 55 million.

220
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,219
Out of that,

221
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,019
the camps and death squads
were responsible for only

222
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,458
11 or 12 million.

223
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,927
Goering: 12.

224
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,161
Could we say
that half of those

225
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,360
were non-Jews?

226
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,129
were Christians,
atheists and pagans.

227
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,175
Hitler:
Awkward language.

228
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,306
What term covers Gypsies,
Polish intelligentsia,

229
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,714
Russian upper strata,
prisoners of war,

230
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,947
French and Yugoslavian partisans,
political opponents?

231
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,455
Well, should we say
''gentiles''?

232
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,891
But if 12 million
were liquidated

233
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,951
and only six million
were Jews--

234
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,156
or is it 5.7?

235
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,858
Why can't l get
accurate figures?!

236
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,958
Where's Himmler?!

237
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,196
l would stand behind
this wording.

238
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,261
Almost half the dead

239
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,035
were from the Christian world.

240
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,000
( Hitler mutters )
Yes.

241
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,211
And yet the Jews
take their removal

242
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,808
so personally.

243
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,683
( Goering laughs )

244
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,881
What strikes me is

245
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,221
that little notice
is taken of the fact

246
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,954
that the first
biological cleansing

247
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,326
eliminated
German nationals--

248
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,161
the disabled, the retarded,

249
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,601
- the mentally ill--
- And the bedwetters.

250
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,332
The useless eaters.

251
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:13,275
Commenced the 1st
of September, 1939.

252
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,370
Actually, mein Führer,

253
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,177
it was October 1st.

254
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,678
You backdated the decree

255
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,745
one month to correspond
with the first day of the war.

256
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,654
- Tidier.
- Yes.

257
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,158
- War for living space.
- Yes.

258
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,194
- War for race purification.
- Yes.

259
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,230
- All began on the same day.
- Yes.

260
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,787
Yes.

261
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,760
Yes.

262
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,370
From Latvia to Lithuania,

263
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,239
from Estonia to Slovakia,

264
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,376
from Russia,

265
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,845
from Poland to the Ukraine--

266
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,910
wherever we found them.

267
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:59,047
250,000

268
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,649
blonde-haired,

269
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,127
blue-eyed nuggets...

270
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,859
harvested
for the Third Reich.

271
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,062
Nordic nuggets,

272
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:16,039
to lighten up
the dark Bavarians.

273
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,246
They took children
from their parents?

274
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,520
They were misplaced Germans.
We brought them home.

275
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,252
( rhythmical resounding sound )

276
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,075
Eva: Look at you,
posing for my camera,

277
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,577
as if you didn't know
l was there.

278
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,841
Hitler: Do l look more
mysterious in a hat?

279
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,646
( Eva giggles )

280
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,156
Eva: Why did you never wear
an official army

281
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,961
- SA or SS uniform?
- Better to remain undefined.

282
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,526
Suggestive indefiniteness.

283
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,774
There are so few public
pictures of you smiling.

284
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,248
There were none
before l was chancellor--

285
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,877
nor any with children

286
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,080
or small animals.

287
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,486
The holiday in lceland
was a joyous time

288
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,430
for my sisters and me.
You should have come with us.

289
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,595
You were always inspired
by the Viking sagas.

290
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,002
The only flaw in the trip

291
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,477
was a delay before
we departed from Hamburg.

292
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,014
l had no time
for holiday trips.

293
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,016
The police came just before
we were to leave.

294
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,520
A family was removed
from the ship.

295
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,782
- l'll never forget the cries--
- Quiet!

296
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,517
Never mention that again!

297
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,138
( softly )
Look.

298
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,076
Did you like me better
when l was blonde,

299
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,080
with baby-fat?

300
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,208
Or later when l was
brunette and thin?

301
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,276
l liked you when you were
blonde and thin.

302
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,691
Hitler: ...fulfillment
of a mysterious longing.

303
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,224
My need to control

304
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,201
will fill others' need
to be controlled.

305
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,433
That was my euphoric
discovery:

306
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,475
the union of my urges

307
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,340
with the German
people's desires!

308
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,075
lf you unite
a powerful people,

309
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,549
whose first duty

310
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,916
is obedience,

311
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,556
you can do

312
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,389
anything.

313
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,996
( whispers )
God...

314
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,665
l love to order.

315
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,300
Every woman a potential
source of solace,

316
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,211
warmth, love.

317
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,418
Every man, a rival.

318
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:04,384
Hitler:
''l am the German spirit.

319
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:09,695
Consider the incomparable
magic of my works...''

320
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:10,927
Did you write that?

321
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,402
''...the incomparable

322
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,939
magic of my works.''

323
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,204
lt's Wagner.

324
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,179
''Man is a beast of prey,

325
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,045
developing through
constant progress.

326
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,415
The beast conquers,
founds great realms

327
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,886
by the subjugation

328
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,889
of other subjugators,

329
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,515
forms states

330
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,288
and organizes civilizations,

331
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,990
in order to enjoy his booty

332
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,793
in peace.

333
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,629
Attack and defense,

334
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,828
suffering and struggle,

335
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:51,103
domination and servitude.''

336
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,270
Are those Wagner's words?

337
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,411
We were both illusionists
and showmen.

338
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,454
l made my life so different,

339
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,183
so vibrant, so extreme.

340
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,892
That was how...

341
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,555
l accumulated power.

342
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,224
l wrapped

343
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,532
iron and blood

344
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,164
in a cloud

345
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,936
of mystic communion

346
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,944
with the German Volk.

347
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,175
Whoever wants
to understand Hitler,

348
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:36,016
must first learn Wagner.

349
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,428
Write this!

350
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,730
Fire.

351
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,567
Fire fascinates Hitler.

352
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,540
lt consumes without
accepting or rejecting.

353
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,455
Hitler: Read the last sentence
back to me.

354
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,360
Typist: ''We made the sound
so overwhelming,

355
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,522
the attitude so certain,

356
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,259
the level of force so high,

357
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,301
the spectacle so grand,

358
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,361
that no one could see
anything at the center

359
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,372
but the symbolism.''

360
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,533
Yes. Good.

361
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,339
The symbolism
at the center.

362
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,382
Like the sun,

363
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,281
nobody could look at me
without the pain

364
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,684
and punishment of blindness.

365
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,891
Number two!
The receptivity of the masses

366
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,519
is unlimited,
yet their understanding

367
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,894
is feeble.
They quickly forget.

368
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,455
Three!

369
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,991
The masses tell each other
small lies.

370
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,038
lt could never come
into their heads

371
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,938
to create colossal tales.

372
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,808
Thus, bold myths work best.

373
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,813
Four.

374
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,816
Effective propaganda must be
confined to stereotypes.

375
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,718
Always focus people's
attention on a single foe.

376
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,747
To have multiple enemies
confuses people.

377
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,254
My genius was the combining

378
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,627
of two enemies--

379
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:31,759
Jews and Marxism--

380
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,929
into one.

381
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,698
Jewish Marxism...

382
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,903
the synthesis

383
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,744
that was the key
to my success.

384
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,579
Weave this in:

385
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,182
Crude simplifications
endlessly repeated

386
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,523
will influence the supple.

387
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,299
Goebbel's realm.

388
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,891
For the non-supple,

389
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,335
the stubborn...

390
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,976
terror is necessary--

391
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,310
Himmler's responsibility.

392
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,830
When l was a small boy
in Linz,

393
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,460
l frequently played alone.

394
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,437
l would walk
to the top of the hill

395
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,599
overlooking the city.

396
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,345
ln dark solitude,

397
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:53,372
l imagined l had absolute
command of those heights

398
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:57,751
and all the lands below.

399
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,190
Only the trees on the hillside
heard my cry.

400
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,161
Heil Hitler!

401
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,600
( under his breath )
Heil Hitler.

402
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,133
Those private moments
stayed with me

403
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,237
through the darkest days.

404
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:40,163
The tragedy of every
charismatic leader

405
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,224
is to be imprisoned
by his fate.

406
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,134
His triumphs are finite,

407
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,869
his needs...

408
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,708
infinite.

409
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,787
( stringed instruments plays )

410
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,959
( choir sings )

411
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,082
- ( choir fades )
- ( overlapping whispers )

412
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,798
This was to have
been built... for you.

413
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,516
Hitler: What will they
think of us?

414
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,824
History...

415
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,026
those who study our lives?

416
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,765
Will we be judged
by what we say,

417
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,807
by our deeds,

418
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,335
by the monuments and images
we leave behind...

419
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,809
or...

420
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,581
by something else?

421
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,316
Something...

422
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,018
we can't control?

423
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,196
Eva: They adored you.

424
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,068
They were stupefied
by the Führer cult...

425
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,274
so hungry for me,

426
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,335
as if l could fill
their emptiness.

427
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,179
By feeding them hope,
you stimulated their craving.

428
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,083
Yes...

429
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:00,920
the desire to be
the desired object.

430
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:05,052
Eva: For women,
you were the ideal lover,

431
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,496
- the perfect father.
- Hitler: Fleeting.

432
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,729
The thrill quickly loses
its impact.

433
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,741
You were the one thing...

434
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,074
that brought me peace.

435
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,781
l told you to destroy
that footage!

436
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:19,461
Hitler: When l was homeless
during a cold Vienna winter,

437
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,904
a Jewish art dealer
gave me an overcoat.

438
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,669
l even had a Jewish friend
at the men's shelter

439
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:31,340
with whom l spent
many pleasant afternoons.

440
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:37,417
Maybe, there would have been
an advantage

441
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:42,892
in not exterminating
the Jews.

442
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,394
Well, for a long time,
we considered a territorial solution.

443
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,060
We would put them
in reservations

444
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,037
or ship them to...

445
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,097
Madagascar.

446
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:02,612
ln fact, we encouraged
mass emigration.

447
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,648
Eichmann's assignment
during the '30s

448
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,310
was to find places
to move them to.

449
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,579
But...

450
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:16,683
few countries would take
more than a handful.

451
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:23,232
Someone even proposed...

452
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:28,270
a mass sterilization plan.

453
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,574
An ugly necessity.

454
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,781
ln every society,
there are pent up hatreds.

455
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,383
For example,
in the United States

456
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,862
it's against the blacks;
in Russia, the successful.

457
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,661
A politician must mobilize

458
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,464
these hatreds.

459
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,474
Reason must be
trained to think

460
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,443
in historical dimensions.

461
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,726
Get out!
Get out!

462
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,632
You'll get nothing from me!
No mercy!

463
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,398
Tell them Hitler has ice
in his veins!

464
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,405
lce!

465
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,211
l'm the greatest actor
in Europe.

466
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,018
l am...

467
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,151
the greatest actor
in Europe.

468
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,400
Hitler: What a thrill
to play the Führer--

469
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,367
for 12 years,

470
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,666
the supreme Father figure.

471
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,103
On to surpass
even Lord Grimm.

472
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,939
They made me
''Man of the Year.''

473
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,813
They made you what?

474
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,546
Time Magazine,
they made me ''Man of the Year.''

475
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,521
l was on the cover
for six issues.

476
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,457
l conquered Poland, Norway,
Denmark, France.

477
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,017
Americans love a winner.

478
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,224
Of course, it doesn't
mean a thing.

479
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,233
They made Roosevelt

480
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,269
''Man of the Year''
three times!

481
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,100
And he was a cripple.

482
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,810
Goebbels:
Look at Himmler.

483
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,250
Hitler: You're not exactly
Clark Gable yourself,

484
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,686
my little doctor.

485
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,781
Himmler looks like a weasel.

486
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,792
Goebbels:
Making our enemies look bad

487
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,987
was often easier
than making us--

488
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,963
Hitler:
The perfect Aryan Superman.

489
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,727
A weak stomach
in the presence of violence.

490
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,965
Woo!
Heinrich Himmler.

491
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,165
Didn't anyone notice?

492
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,175
He was ruthless,

493
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,006
but not careless.

494
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,012
And Hitler-loyal.

495
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,207
Who better to run the SS?

496
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,341
Art must be plausible.

497
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,284
lf you wrote a script
about Aryan superiority

498
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,686
and cast Himmler,
people would laugh,

499
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,724
walk out of the theatre.

500
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,124
On the political stage,

501
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,287
you can do anything.

502
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,895
Let's put up another reel.

503
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,459
lmages to blur facts.

504
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,207
Hitler: ln World War l,
l was a messenger.

505
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,368
l never killed anyone.

506
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,502
l am a vegetarian.

507
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,513
l never eat dead animals.

508
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,879
l loathe big game hunters--

509
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,111
a gruesome bloodbath.

510
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,347
l would not allow smoking
in my presence.

511
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,083
We discouraged
tobacco consumption.

512
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,853
l insisted on the humane
treatment of pets

513
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,861
and farm animals.

514
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,796
l even issued a decree
regulating the cooking

515
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,766
of lobsters to minimize
their suffering.

516
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,236
l reduced chemicals
in fruits and vegetables.

517
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,638
The SS planted
organic gardens.

518
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,404
l am not a brutal man
by nature.

519
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,638
l am not a brutal man
by nature.

520
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,045
l am not a brutal man
by nature.

521
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,573
l'm not a brutal man
by nature.

522
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,485
l am not a brutal man.

523
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,358
Hitler: Only a charismatic
leader could heal the wounds

524
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,730
of the great war inflicted on us
by the November criminals.

525
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,826
Hitler's charisma was
as much created

526
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,768
by the German masses
as it was

527
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,329
imposed upon them.
ln peacetime,

528
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,968
stability and routine
undermine charisma.

529
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,104
ln wartime,
the great threat

530
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,308
is defeat.

531
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,351
lt was the failure
of the will

532
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,579
of the German people

533
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:14,681
that fatally undermined
my charisma!

534
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,415
You take...

535
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,958
an ordinary man,

536
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:29,092
dress him in a uniform...

537
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,262
and that man...

538
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:37,603
will commit acts

539
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,701
he never before...

540
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,746
imagined.

541
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,463
You can turn
a runny-nosed, bedwetter...

542
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,402
into a ruthless warrior.

543
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,945
lf l'd stopped with
the conquest of France,

544
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,456
l would have gone
down in history

545
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,118
as the greatest conqueror
since Alexander The Great.

546
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,684
No! No, no.

547
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:38,261
''Greatest military
genius in history.''

548
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,634
Wait--
what do you think?

549
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,673
Well, no...

550
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,103
Ah... here it is.

551
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,405
''Greatest empire
since Caesar.''

552
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,676
That-- that's it.

553
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,911
Let's make it...

554
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:59,183
lf l had stopped
with the conquest of France,

555
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,190
l would have built

556
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,283
the greatest sustained empire

557
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,227
since Caesar Augustus.

558
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,266
What l hated most
about the war

559
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,307
was fighting the English.

560
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,606
The fair Brits...

561
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,203
our racial brothers,

562
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,545
our natural allies--

563
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,981
Saxons.

564
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,784
Anglos.

565
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,485
The very word means angels,
doesn't it?

566
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,462
Eva: Mmm...

567
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,725
lt's a tranquil image.

568
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,700
All the Germanic peoples

569
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,169
coming together.

570
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,638
The traitor Churchill...

571
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,905
never told his countrymen
that l offered an alliance,

572
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,373
a union of racial brothers...

573
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:03,718
and protection
of the British Empire.

574
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,829
Eva: Wolfie?

575
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,071
Wolfie?

576
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,714
ln a different era,
parts of me that were

577
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,018
compassionate and sensitive

578
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,582
might have developed
but, in my era,

579
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,390
there were forces
and attractions

580
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,489
that led me to become
the founder

581
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,627
and perfect leader
of the new religion.

582
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:04,640
Think of Volk and Reich!

583
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,677
Our great nation!

584
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,991
We prefer the spoken
to the written word.

585
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:31,591
More so, symbols
to any kind of words.

586
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,295
And above all,

587
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,271
pageantry, spectacle,
and music.

588
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,466
People thought
l choreographed

589
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,907
the Nuremberg Rally
to make the film

590
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,275
''Triumph of the Will.''

591
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,712
The critics lack
the imagination to see

592
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,618
that l orchestrated
World War ll,

593
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,713
for the same reasons...

594
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,516
the invasion of countries.

595
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,495
Mobilization of millions
of extras

596
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,861
to produce the most magnificent

597
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,867
and historic film footage,

598
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,732
footage delivered nightly

599
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,238
from the front by courier

600
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,765
for my personal review.

601
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,609
So, my sons and daughters,

602
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:21,674
take guidance from the arts...

603
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,011
to write a bestseller

604
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,989
or to stir a nation!

605
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,322
Simplify.

606
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,055
Your hero must have no fears

607
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,222
and you villain no need
of affection.

608
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,528
The fair maiden

609
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,966
must be blonde,

610
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:45,440
and the villain
must wear dark clothing

611
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,567
and a mustache.

612
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,844
Life is ambiguous.

613
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,386
None of us
can stand ambiguity.

614
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,989
Me, least of all.

615
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,201
lf you told the truth,

616
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,464
both the teller
and the listener

617
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,529
would go insane.

618
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,587
Tell me.
For you, what redeems life?

619
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,589
The purely artistic.

620
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,791
Read Nietzsche.

621
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,961
But what of the spiritual
dimension?

622
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,129
To be a creative artist,

623
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:52,902
one inevitably
walks the spiritual path.

624
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,809
ln fact,
they are the same path.

625
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:58,040
Hmm.

626
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,344
Good. Good.

627
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,316
But, there is so much more
to understand, Adolf.

628
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,883
- So many died--
- Stop!

629
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,522
Conscience is
the Jewish invention.

630
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,930
For us National Socialists,

631
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,561
action follows thought
as quickly as...

632
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:22,628
thunder follows lightning.

633
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,684
Hitler: Let's finish
this section.

634
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,552
Typist: ''Enigma,
carefully manipulated

635
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,183
enhances one's power
and fame.''

636
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,956
Hitler: Make that,
''Fame, power and immortality.''

637
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,797
Obfuscation keeps
people guessing--

638
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:54,894
the little feints,
the ambiguities,

639
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,962
contradictions...

640
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:01,634
ln my first four years,
as head of the Nazi party,

641
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,441
l forbade photos
to be taken of me.

642
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:08,415
To my surprise,

643
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,283
the efforts to keep
these things hidden

644
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:14,551
created a cloak of enigma.

645
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,853
People want to know.
They talk.

646
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:24,298
They were kept on edge.

647
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,699
Yeah, better delete
that last section.

648
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,135
Typist: You mean,
starting with the line

649
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,799
- ''obfuscations''?
- No, no.

650
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,174
From ''There were things about me

651
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,372
that l was not
comfortable with.''

652
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,670
The horrors
of the First World War,

653
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,368
the turmoil
of the post-war years.

654
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,808
By the 1930s,

655
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,473
Germany was
an abused child.

656
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,914
From her wounds, grew...

657
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,382
National Socialism,

658
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,558
''the great healer.''

659
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,562
''The great healer.''

660
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,831
l can remember the first time
l spoke publicly.

661
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,496
ln 1919.

662
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,836
Or was it 1920?

663
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,876
Crowd of veterans...

664
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:45,108
disheartened, broken men

665
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:49,709
who'd spent four agonized years
in the trenches,

666
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,586
only to return
unappreciated.

667
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:57,217
Civilians could never know.

668
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,958
They were moved
by my words,

669
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,965
my fervor.

670
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,128
l could speak.

671
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,241
l remember...

672
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,300
one young man
in a wheelchair

673
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,142
who'd lost his legs--

674
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,978
there was an ecstasy
on his face.

675
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,382
l knew joy.

676
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:27,354
l had the power

677
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,891
to heal the sick.

678
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,763
As with Wagner's music,

679
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,061
people could
lose themselves

680
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,227
in the totality
of my voice.

681
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,066
One must be cautious, Adolf.

682
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,405
All people want
to be gods.

683
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,707
Unfortunately,
some do not recognize

684
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,804
the impossibility of it.

685
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,241
You're wrong.

686
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,411
Every man
has God within him.

687
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,149
Fortunately,

688
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,885
most people
don't recognize this.

689
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:08,330
There is no essence
beneath appearance,

690
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,730
only a series
of appearances,

691
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,734
each rising
out of the one before

692
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,736
and giving birth
to the next.

693
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,705
l merely fulfilled
the plans and programs

694
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,969
of my original sponsors.
