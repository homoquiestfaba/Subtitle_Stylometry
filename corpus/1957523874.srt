00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:45,845
Hey, stop it, get out of here.

189
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,045
Leave me alone!

190
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,784
Spend some time
alone with the statue.

191
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,084
Yes, ma'am. We'll
be on our way.

192
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:53,720
It's just that we
know he's in this park

193
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,020
and we're still looking for him

194
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:56,388
and I know that if
you come across him,

195
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,157
you're gonna like him
less than you like us,

196
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,260
because he's a true buffoon
and a rapscallion to boot.

197
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,096
I am not going
to ask you again!

198
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,636

00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:16,375
Ah!

[upbeat music]

203
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:20,145
Oh, it's a little dog!

204
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:22,981
Ah!

205
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,286
That dog is a...

206
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:29,823
Oh!

207
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:41,233
I'm sorry, excuse
me, accident.

208
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,335
I'm gonna put everything back.

209
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:44,303
Here.

210
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:47,774
Oh! Something's missing.

211
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:54,647
Oops. I'm sorry.

212
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,316
This goes here.

213
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:58,183
Now there.

214
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:02,988
Ta-da!

No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

217
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:17,537
Ah!

218
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,140
Taxi, taxi!

00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,428
This dingus, get
out of the way.

222
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,197
No, just pick a lane.

223
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:46,966
Get out of the...

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,901
Oh my gosh.

225
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:51,503
Gimme a break.

226
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,006
Well, well, well.

227
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:02,414
[Popovich yelling]

[dog barking]

229
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,528
[Officer] I lost him again!

00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:23,402
[upbeat music]

232
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,056
It was horrible!

233
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,389
He's a monster!

234
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:48,493
You!

235
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:51,664
I'll destroy you!

236
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:03,108
Ah, gotcha!

237
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,592
You're free, get out of here!

238
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,687
[Officer] Get him!

239
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,628
[people yelling]

240
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:12,945
- How'd you lose 'em again?
- How did I lose 'em?!

241
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,014
- Smoke and mirrors.
- Idiots, are you kidding me?

242
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,583
Sorry, I'm so
sorry. We'll find him.

243
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,351
- He was right here!
- We'll get him,

244
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:20,620
I promise you.

245
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:24,824
[Officer] He's been
doing this all day.

[Susan] Morons!

00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:27,325
Shh, shh.

248
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,861
Who's a good doggy?

249
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,630
Who's a good doggy?

250
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:31,631
Where are you?

251
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,666
Where is that dog!

[car door opens]

253
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,336
[engine starts]

254
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,679
Hi.

255
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:47,747
[gavel bangs]

256
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,015
Listen up.

257
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:52,652
I'm gonna cut right to
the chase, Mr. Popovich,

258
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:54,687
you are in big trouble.

259
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,756
You've done a sizeable
amount of damage in this town

260
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:59,025
and you're not going anywhere

261
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,561
until you've paid
to have it fixed.

262
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:05,031
Now I know you're penniless,
just passing through,

263
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:08,067
don't have a place to
live, but around here,

264
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:12,538
a man works until he's
righted what he's done wrong.

265
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:17,577
So I'm gonna set you up with
a job and a place to stay

266
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,213
until you've paid for
all of the damages,

267
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,582
especially the statue.

268
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,151
Now there's a shack by an
old man Miller's house,

269
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,418
nobody's using it right now,

270
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:28,353
so you can stay
there for a while.

271
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:29,889
And first thing
tomorrow morning,

272
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,758
you're gonna go to this address

273
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,292
and start your brand new job.

274
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:38,030
It's not much, but it's
better than a jail cell.

275
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,533
He deserves a jail cell!

276
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:44,203
What kind of backwoods
justice is this?

277
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:46,205
He destroyed my statue.

278
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,708
And he's going to work until
he's paid to have it fixed.

279
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:51,110
I could have it
fixed tomorrow myself!

280
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,345
That's not the point.

281
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,480
I want him punished.

282
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:59,384
I'm still the judge in this
town and I've made up my mind.

283
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:03,256
He's gonna work until his debt
is paid off and that's final.

284
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:05,725
Without a time limit even?

285
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:06,626
Look at him.

286
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,227
Okay, Susan. Okay.

287
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:12,899
Mr. Popovich, I'm gonna
give you two weeks to prove

288
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:14,567
that you can keep a job

289
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,969
and be a functioning
member of society.

290
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:20,807
And if that broken statue is
not fixed in those two weeks,

291
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,575
you will go to jail.

292
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,878
Satisfied, Mrs. Meglopolos?

293
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:27,814
Fine.

[dramatic music]

295
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:35,188
Make sure everything that
can go wrong for him,

296
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,722
does go wrong.

297
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:39,926
Gather evidence that
we can use against him.

298
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:43,196
I will see him in a jail cell.

299
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:44,630
And Keep an eye on your dog.

300
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:46,632
If he gets into
any more trouble,

301
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,433
you'll be the one
that pays for it.

302
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:50,102
- But this is not my dog.
- Dismissed!

Hi, neighbor.

- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

I do hope you're not
expecting a table for two.

315
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,818
Oh, no, no.

316
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:40,853
I'm here about the job.

317
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:47,960
Hey, sorry buddy. You
have to wait outside.

318
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:49,962
Stay out of trouble.

319
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:51,597
So the judge has sent you here

to work off a debt to the city.

321
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:54,166
Yes.

322
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,535
Marvelous.

323
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:58,638

Okay, listen up, everybody.

330
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:00,800
I need to make sure that
you're very familiar

331
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,902
with today's specials.

332
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:06,504
Clean Carl, will you
go get the sample tray?

333
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,841
And we have a new employee,

334
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,912
a criminal who was assigned
to us against my will

335
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,114
by a judge I lost a bet to.

336
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:17,817
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't
know how to do anything.

337
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,985
Oh wait, wait.

338
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:21,320
We've seen them juggle, right?

339
00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:23,856
But can you do anything useful?

To the kitchen.

348
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,845

What is wrong with you?

00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:03,429
I'm sorry. It was accident.

354
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,830
I can't work like this.

I'm Clean Carl.

And I certainly don't
mean for my nickname

to become one of those
ironic nicknames.

00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:13,906
I'm going home to change.

Oh, well, how's
your day going?

Okay.

365
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:31,724
Excuse me, uh,

this can for the soup.

367
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,228
Yeah, that's a can of soup.

Oh, one more question,
uh, this plate dirty?

wouldn't let you do
the act you wanted

1043

so you sabotaged him
in front of everyone,

which accidentally caused
the circus to be blacklisted

1045

of bullies in your life

a jerk to you.

jerk in your life?

Try thinking about what
is making them so angry

1060
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:52,178
and see if you can think
of a way to help them.
