1
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:26,900
[explosions, then rumbling]

2
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,600
[gunfire]

3
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,167
[explosions]

4
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,600
[man over radio] Acknowledge
when in position, Sergeant Davis.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,967
[whispering]
Dagger Team 1, copy. I keep losing you.

6
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,633
- How long till my backup's here?
- Working on it. Stand by.

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,700
[explosion, then rumbling]

8
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,867
Say eight to ten minutes.
Advise you stay put.

9
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,633
I can't wait for backup.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Send them in behind me.

11
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,267
Davis, maintain your position.
They're on their way.

12
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,633
[whirring]

13
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,633
[tinkling]

14
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:18,633
[whirring]

15
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,133
Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?
There's some kind of disturbance here.

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,233
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?

17
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,600
What the hell?

18
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,167
Davis.

19
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,967
Davis, what's your status?

20
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,600
[radio static]

21
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,267
Davis, come in!

22
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,900
[whirring]

23
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,167
[man] Got you.

24
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,333
[man 1]... gonna get a late start.

25
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
[man 2]
Right, well, it's a closed session.

26
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,667
[woman]
Most of the specs stayed the same...

27
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,600
[man over PA]
Dr. Osbourne, call 204. Dr. Osbourne, 204.

28
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,033
[indistinct chattering]

29
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,967
[man 1] They're issuing temporaries
for that R and D, as far as I know.

30
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,833
[man 2]
Is that part of the same badge or...?

31
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
[man 3] I'm pretty sure.

32
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,100
- [man 2] All right.
- [man 4] How's it going?

33
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,333
- [man 5] Hey.
- [man 6] Hi.

34
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
- [man 7] We'll get everything.
- [man 8] Marty was already in?

35
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:04,833
[man 9] Yeah.

36
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,700
[man 10]
And she's working on that project?

37
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:09,167
[man 11] They'll be done in about a week.
I was gonna say...

38
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,133
[man over PA] Don Taylor, report
to Laser Laboratory Building B, Laser Lab.

39
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,667
[man 1] Okay, I'll take a look.

40
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,627
- Where have you been?
- [Clyne] Solving problems.

41
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,233
You look... dusty.

42
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,633
Sometimes you gotta get dusty, Efrem.

43
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
- Test the pulse?
- Yeah.

44
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,867
Went down to the vault,
asked Johnson for some tetracene,

45
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,800
but apparently, we don't store it.

46
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,267
It's outdated and expensive as shit.

47
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,033
It got expensive.
Back in the '90s, it used to be cheap.

48
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,967
So, if you look hard enough...
you can still find some lying around.

49
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,300
You find a street gang
that slings tetracene?

50
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,833
Industrial printer cartridge,
$14.99 back in the day.

51
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,833
- Get me a mount, would you?
- Here you go.

52
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,033
Thank you.

53
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,933
[Efrem] You gonna tell the suits
you're running this on a 20-year-old part?

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
I'll show them it works and say:

55
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,833
"That's the difference between a prototype
and a production model."

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Okay.

57
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,200
Concavity is spun to zero.

58
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,733
Lens track is hot.

59
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,933
Alignment is keyed in.

60
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,633
You are good to go.

61
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,633
I'll let you call it.

62
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
[whirring, then beeping]

63
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,267
[powering up]

64
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,933
If you think about the applications on
other materials, it could be significant.

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,033
Metals, for instance, can be shattered
with very little effort or noise.

66
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:42,000
Concrete, rubber... they're all vulnerable
to violent temperature changes.

67
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:46,767
Yeah, this project started
as a request from SEAL Team 6.

68
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,200
After the siege in Rwanda,

69
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:51,333
they came to us
asking for the capability...

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,367
to flash freeze or boil
the enemy's water supply.

71
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:58,200
Now, this device could have
driven the enemy out.

72
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,933
And you... tried this on living things?

73
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:07,667
That wasn't our intent here, initially.

74
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:09,967
We'd like you test it.

75
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,367
Any volunteers?

76
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,367
[chuckling]

77
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,000
[chuckles] Well... we'll give it a try.

78
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:20,800
Gentlemen, why don't we go sit down?
We'll talk over the next steps. All right?

79
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,833
Yeah. Right this way.

80
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,200
[indistinct chattering]

81
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,033
[Mindala] What do you want,
a clean conscience?

82
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,667
Test it with a slab of beef
for all I care.

83
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,833
What I want is to use it
for what we originally designed it as.

84
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
A deterrent.

85
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,267
Nobody said anything
about microwaving people's lungs.

86
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,333
It's war.

87
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,967
It's the business we're in.

88
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,367
Remember what you sold it to me as
when you hired me?

89
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,733
Defense.

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
[chuckles]
And that's still partially true.

91
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,267
But war is good business.

92
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,300
So is human trafficking.

93
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:59,000
We work for DARPA, Mark.
We work for the government.

94
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,267
"I don't know what weapons
we'll use in World War III,

95
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,233
- but World War IV will be fought with..."
- "Sticks and stones." Albert Einstein.

96
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,633
- He worked for the government.
- Mm-hm. That's right.

97
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:12,733
And if you ask him, I don't think
he thought that was his finest hour.

98
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm sure he has feelings about
flash-boiling human flesh.

99
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,600
Ever think about prosthetic limbs
with full sensory feedback?

100
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,367
Ah. Prosthetics... don't win wars.

101
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,933
Did you hear that?

102
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
That is the empathetic scientist
in you dying.

103
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Hmm.

104
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,600
Did you brief your guys
on how to operate the ray?

105
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:31,967
- I did.
- Good.

106
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,733
Then you can start packing.

107
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,000
Can you be more specific?

108
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,067
Mm-hm.

109
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,667
About these goggles.

110
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,067
Your... hyperspectral goggles

111
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:48,033
being deployed by Special Forces
in Eastern Europe in the Moldovan War.

112
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,133
- I'm aware. I read the field reports.
- No, you have not read this report.

113
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,800
Orland called me personally.
General Orland.

114
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,267
He said things are very...
sensitive down there.

115
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,833
And they're... seeing things.

116
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,600
Okay. Like what?

117
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
They won't tell me.

118
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,667
They won't share the video feed.
They won't discuss what they're seeing.

119
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,767
They just want the lead engineer
down there to advise and consult.

120
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:21,100
Look, you invented these goggles
to keep our guys safe.

121
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,067
Well, now they need your help.

122
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,167
Think of it as defense.

123
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,480
[man 1] Let me reboot the guidance system.

124
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,561
[man 2] It's locked tight.
We have to pull it out.

125
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,440
[man 3] All right, let's go. Move it out.

126
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,300
[indistinct chattering]

127
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,300
- Mark Clyne?
- What?

128
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,833
You the guy that designed the helmet cam?

129
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,600
- Yes. Mark Clyne.
- James Orland. Come with me.

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
[Clyne]
A lot of new boots on the ground here.

131
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,633
[Orland] The country's in chaos.

132
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,267
The insurgency is mostly remnants
of the military dictatorship

133
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,667
that ran this place
until about two months ago.

134
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:32,700
And their popular support is primarily
in the north part of the country...

135
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,333
near the Russian border,
and here in the capital.

136
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,167
The problem is
their forces are well-trained.

137
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,667
They're threatening to turn
this whole thing into a civil war.

138
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:47,067
[indistinct chattering]

139
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,967
Moldova. Russians had it, lost it.

140
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,667
It became independent,
but it's struggling internally.

141
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,700
On the one hand, you have an insurgency,

142
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,700
made up of the regime's
former elite soldiers.

143
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,600
They're well-trained and dangerous.

144
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
On the other,
you have most of the population,

145
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,300
who are tearing down the regime's flags
and demanding a new government.

146
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:11,967
Civil unrest, as complicated as it is,
is a business we're familiar with.

147
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,700
We like to think we're good at it.

148
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,733
But this thing your camera found...

149
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,300
it's a whole new piece of business.

150
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,233
I can't send this video to EUCOM.
I'm just afraid they'd think it's a joke.

151
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,940
[Clyne]
DOD doesn't have a sense of humor.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,033
[Orland] Typically not. Hook us up.

153
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,967
I'm sure there's a scientific explanation
for what's on these,

154
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,033
but until you tell me,

155
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,067
I'm not sending it
up the chain of command.

156
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,133
- You done?
- [man] Yes, sir.

157
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
- Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside.
- Sir.

158
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,200
[door closes]

159
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,267
Nobody here has been able
to make heads or tails of this.

160
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,167
It's thrown a wrench
into our entire operation

161
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,833
for reasons I'm not at liberty
to discuss with you.

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,733
I can tell you we need answers fast.

163
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,200
- Do you mind?
- You spotted that quick.

164
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,367
Five different helmet cams picked up
something similar in the last three weeks.

165
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,367
At first, our signals intelligence tech
wrote it off as interference.

166
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,333
That's not interference.

167
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,667
I don't think you'd fly me
all the way here for interference.

168
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,133
Wanna tell me what you're thinking?

169
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,167
I want you to tell me
what you're thinking.

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
I don't know what I'm thinking... yet.

171
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,633
But there is an explanation.

172
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,733
[Orland] That was the first sighting.
Three others just like it.

173
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,133
The last was different.
It involved a member of Delta Force,

174
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,967
that makes it particularly sensitive.

175
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,100
This is Fran Madison with CIA.

176
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,700
What Special Ops does here
is done under CIA covert operations.

177
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,000
You need to sign this
before we go any further.

178
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,333
- What is this?
- It's an SCI oath.

179
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,333
You're acknowledging it's life in prison
if you reveal anything you're told.

180
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
[door buzzing and clanging]

181
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,267
[beeping]

182
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,033
[door buzzing]

183
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,700
- [Fran] Cue up the Davis file, please.
- [man] Yes, ma'am.

184
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,967
Three days ago
we conducted a raid in mid-city.

185
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,267
Our communications were intermittent,
and a guy got separated from the group...

186
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,000
where he ended up killed in action.

187
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,300
He got closer than anybody.

188
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Too close.

189
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,033
[radio static]

190
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,333
[whirring]

191
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,633
[Davis] Dagger Team 1, you seeing this?
There's some kind of disturbance here.

192
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,633
[man over radio]
Davis, what is that? What are you seeing?

193
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,000
[Davis] What the hell?

194
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
[radio static]

195
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,933
Sergeant Chris Davis.

196
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,267
Three-tour combat vet. Best of the best.

197
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,800
In the last few weeks
we've been finding bodies around the city

198
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,300
that were killed in the same way.

199
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
The autopsies defied all explanation.

200
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,733
Their internal organs were frozen

201
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,833
and yet, their skin was burned
and corroded.

202
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:34,667
The only response from the allied Moldovan
military contact is shock, confusion.

203
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,933
And there's anger.

204
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:40,333
There's teenagers spray-painting
"genocide aratare" at kill sites.

205
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,733
- Genocide...?
- "Aratare."

206
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,333
It's a local myth. The ghosts of war.

207
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,300
"As nightmarish as."
That's the literal translation.

208
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,167
- That's very poetic.
- [Fran] Well, they're superstitious.

209
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,033
They somehow think...

210
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,767
the horrors of the war have
kicked up something unnatural.

211
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,367
- We hope you have an alternate theory.
- What do you think?

212
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,900
- Think you need a new name for them.
- Beyond that.

213
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,700
- Give me a copy of the data, some time...
- That's not possible.

214
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,800
You want me to figure this out right now?

215
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,107
- [Orland] We want your assessment.
- I don't have one yet.

216
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:16,600
Then, I think we have to send our
working theory up the chain of command.

217
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,233
- I don't wanna do that.
- Okay. What is your working theory?

218
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,667
The agency thinks
this is some kind of cloaking technology.

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,233
Insurgent soldiers wearing
active camouflage.

220
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,233
In this country? Something that advanced?

221
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,800
CIA knows a few groups in Europe and Asia
could be working on active camouflage.

222
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:36,000
DARPA's worked on cloaking technology.
We're years away from a prototype.

223
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,333
- Maybe somebody beat you to it.
- DARPA is the leader in the field.

224
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Are you certain of that?

225
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,800
The regime spent heavily
on weapons research.

226
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:47,267
Corruption, loose legislation.
You're a military lab and want obscurity?

227
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,833
- This is a great place to work and hide.
- Okay.

228
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:56,267
Let's say it is cloaking technology.

229
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,267
- How do you account for cause of death?
- A shock delivered to the victim.

230
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,300
I think you're reaching.

231
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,667
Our business requires us
to make suppositions.

232
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,600
My business requires us to prove them.

233
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,767
Your technician's job is to find glitches,
so, he sees glitches.

234
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,300
Your job is to find the enemy,
so, you see the enemy.

235
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,367
Locals believe in spirits,
so they see spirits.

236
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,033
Everyone is biased, in one way or another.

237
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:25,667
So, my answer to you right now is that
we lack data to support any theory.

238
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:27,267
Okay.

239
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,933
What do you need
to make a more definitive statement?

240
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,300
First, you need a better shot.

241
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,633
That's what I'm looking for,
a better shot.

242
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,267
How?

243
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,233
- Right here, sir.
- That's it.

244
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,233
I brought this from DARPA.
A hyperspectral camera.

245
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,267
A more powerful version of the helmet cams
your guys are using.

246
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,333
It sees deeper into the spectrum of light.

247
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Visible or invisible,
if something's there, this'll pick it up.

248
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:07,267
Can you mount this thing...
on a Delta vehicle?

249
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,300
- I don't see why not.
- [Orland] All right, good.

250
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,367
We run missions into the city every day.

251
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:14,633
I'll put you with our field tech,
tell him how to operate it.

252
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,167
I wouldn't put a tech in between
this camera and myself.

253
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,067
So, you wanna operate it?

254
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:26,600
If you want that kill shot... you'll need
a fast reaction time out there.

255
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,700
Next mission, you ride with Delta.

256
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,100
They're gonna get you close to this thing.
You get me the kill shot...

257
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,067
you can go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

258
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,633
[man 1]
Got a bad rotor, you gotta swap that out.

259
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
[man 2] Weld it onto the front panel.

260
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,333
[indistinct chattering]

261
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,200
Well, well, well. Toll, check that out.

262
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,200
- [man 1] What's this guy up to, man?
- [man 2] I don't know.

263
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,600
[man 3] Believe this guy?

264
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,333
- [man 4] If it works.
- [man 5] For real.

265
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
[whistles]

266
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,133
Heard you're installing a camera
on our truck.

267
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Which was fine
until you ripped out that 50 cal.

268
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,667
You're taking down a gun
to put up a camera?

269
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,200
It's the only place large enough
to mount it.

270
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,133
[Toll] You guys get that, right?
I know it sounds like a terrible idea.

271
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,933
We prefer to dance with who brung us...
Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,233
"Dance with who brung you"?
No, actually, I don't.

273
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,600
This truck has saved our lives,
many times.

274
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,867
I understand.

275
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
[Cabrera] You guys know Dr. Clyne's team
built that truck?

276
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,700
Clyne works over at DARPA.

277
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:41,200
I've worked closely with his group.
Been to their facilities in Virginia.

278
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,667
- Good to see you, Dr. Clyne.
- Good to see you, Captain Cabrera.

279
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:47,967
They retrofitted these trucks
with tougher, lighter weight armor.

280
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,967
They designed the mechanical loaders
that do the heavy lifting,

281
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:53,200
so you boys don't strain yourselves
too hard.

282
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,333
Matter of fact, Dr. Clyne himself

283
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,667
developed the thin weight Kevlar
body stocking that literally...

284
00:19:58,733 --> 00:19:59,894
[Toll grunts] [soldiers groan]

285
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:00,933
Protects your balls.

286
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,000
So, I would think there'd be nothing
but goodwill in this group for Dr. Clyne.

287
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,200
- Major Sessions.
- Captain, have your men fall back.

288
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,367
- [man 1] Get back to it.
- [man 2] Get her done.

289
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,333
This is Dr. Clyne.

290
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,300
He's worked with us eight or ten times
over the last five years.

291
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,067
You ever go out with the assault team?

292
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,067
No, sir.

293
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:24,767
He's a good man, major.

294
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,100
That's great. I'm just not a fan
of taking tourists on combat missions.

295
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,600
Sir, I'm not a tourist.

296
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,233
If you're not carrying an M4,
you're a tourist.

297
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
I'll carry one, if you'd like.

298
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,600
We gotta get Dr. Clyne out in the field

299
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,900
to track the target force
and get a kill shot.

300
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,000
How long before
this equipment's operational?

301
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,367
A few hours.

302
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,700
- Is it gonna work?
- If we get close enough.

303
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,600
Let me tell you something.
Sergeant Davis... he got close enough.

304
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,733
That's the best Delta that we had.

305
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:56,100
Make sure your equipment
is top-notch this time.

306
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,067
- They were like brothers.
- I get it.

307
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

308
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,033
Evening, doc.

309
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
[indistinct chattering]

310
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,867
[Cabrera] Hear you two hit it off bigtime.

311
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:30,933
[chuckles]

312
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:37,767
- She can come off a bit intense.
- Yeah. So can you.

313
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,633
I'm just here to find this thing.

314
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,900
You're willing to go on
a combat mission to find it.

315
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,833
She is, too.

316
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,167
She's under a lot of pressure from D.C.

317
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,833
They want an answer
and it's her job to give them one.

318
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,767
Saw your names on a mission roster.

319
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,867
I knew this was a top priority...

320
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,000
but for them to embed you both...

321
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,100
Well, you don't have to worry about me.

322
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,933
I'm not worried about you, doc.
I'm worried about it.

323
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,067
She's hoping it's cloaking technology.

324
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,867
What do you think it is?

325
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,367
Something no one's thought of yet.

326
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,333
Gentlemen, yesterday at 1800 hours,

327
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,333
Utah Team left here on a recon mission
to Durlesti,

328
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
when they were engaged by insurgents.

329
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,233
We managed to hear most
of their chatter during the firefight,

330
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
but come were unreliable.

331
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,900
Target is a five-story
apartment building here.

332
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,033
We think what's left of Utah Team
is being held on the fourth floor,

333
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,867
in the northwest corner apartment.

334
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,267
We're gonna be knee-deep
in an insurgent-held area.

335
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,333
So, we should expect a fight.

336
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,133
One last thing.

337
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,600
Before our guys were grabbed,
they radioed in that they saw

338
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,667
what we're calling
hyperspectral anomalies.

339
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:01,700
Your mission is a quick extraction.
You get our guys and you get out.

340
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,167
However, if engaged,
neutralize the anomalies in the area.

341
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,233
[Toll] Neutralize them?

342
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,200
- How?
- Yeah, what are we dealing with here?

343
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,833
We believe these are enemy soldiers
in advanced electronic camouflage.

344
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,167
- So, be surgical when you fire.
- If we don't really know what they are...

345
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,867
Excuse me?
Would you like to add something?

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,867
If they are wearing cloaking technology,

347
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,733
you need to bring it back
as intact as possible.

348
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
Dr. Clyne and Agent Madison
will be on mission with you.

349
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,767
Dr. Clyne will be monitoring
your helmet-cam feeds

350
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,800
from the second MRAP vehicle
in the convoy.

351
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Major Sessions will lead Dagger Team 1
to do the extraction.

352
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,800
Stay on come. Get your gear.

353
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,233
- [man 1] Partner, let's go.
- [man 2] AJ, front and center.

354
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,867
[man 3] Weapons check, Billy.

355
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,867
[man 4] You got it.

356
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,167
[man 1]
Our ride not smooth enough for you?

357
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,000
[man 2]
And you call yourself hard-ass.

358
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,333
[man 3] They really need
to repave these roads, man.

359
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,133
All right, guys,
we're coming into the abandoned zone.

360
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,633
Expect a heavy insurgent presence.

361
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,461
[indistinct chattering over radio]

362
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
[man] Okay.

363
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,347
[Sessions]
I've got an insurgent body here.

364
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:39,100
I got Agopia from Utah Team.
Confirmed KIA.

365
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,100
None of these guys appear to have taken
any rounds. No entry or exit wounds.

366
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:47,167
Alessio here. Moving to the fifth floor.

367
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,600
- We got movement.
- Toll, check your 2 o'clock.

368
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,100
Where? We don't see anything.

369
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,667
- That's it. Right there.
- You're right on top of it.

370
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,667
[Clyne] It's a motion signature.
There's something under that tub.

371
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,933
[Sessions] Lewis, the tub.
I want you to flip over the tub.

372
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,367
- Toll, I want you on what's underneath.
- I'm on it.

373
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:44,000
One, two, three.

374
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,800
We have Comstock alive and conscious.

375
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:55,900
Repeat. We have Sergeant Comstock
from Utah Team.

376
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,967
[grunts]

377
00:28:57,867 --> 00:28:59,100
[grunting]

378
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,167
Hey, buddy.

379
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
- Where's the rest of your team?
- They're upstairs.

380
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,800
But they're all gone.
Got under their skin.

381
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,933
- What got under their skin...?
- I saw it.

382
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,300
- But...?
- Blanket.

383
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,867
Like a frozen blanket.

384
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:22,133
- Okay, where is the rest of Utah?
- Oh, they're dead.

385
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,633
Yeah, they're all dead.

386
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,333
We're all dead.

387
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,100
- Where are the bodies?
- I told you, they're on the top floor.

388
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,300
Oh, you haven't seen it.

389
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
I've seen it.
You know I believe in God, John.

390
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:15,733
This is the opposite of God.

391
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,867
Wait. Who's this?
Can you tell him to turn back?

392
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:32,267
McFadden, turn back.
Give us a view of that room.

393
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,173
[McFadden] Nothing's there.
I'm standing right here.

394
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,767
Mac, we're both staring right at it.
It's in the middle of your view port.

395
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,600
What? That? It's a smear.

396
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,867
Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.

397
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,900
- No, no, no. Tell him to put them back on.
- Mac, put the goggles back on.

398
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,967
Mac, do it now.

399
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
- What the...?
- Take the shot.

400
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:03,267
They went right through it.

401
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,900
- Did he miss?
- He doesn't miss.

402
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,700
[whirring]

403
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Major Sessions, we have a KIA.
McFadden.

404
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:18,000
A hyperspectral target is
on the fifth floor, northwest corner.

405
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,700
Switch to heavy rounds or 203s.

406
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:22,000
Whatever you have to do
to bring this thing down.

407
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,067
[grunting]

408
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:36,867
[thudding]

409
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:38,867
Tell them to pull out.

410
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:43,933
[thudding]

411
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,833
There!

412
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,633
[grunts]

413
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,333
[man] Get everyone out now!

414
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
- Tell them to pull out now.
- No, we're not leaving empty-handed.

415
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,367
I guarantee you're leaving empty-handed.

416
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Come on!

417
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,833
[man 1] Grenade!

418
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,033
- We need support!
- [Cabrera] Get out.

419
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,033
All units evacuate now.
Let's go. Get back to the truck.

420
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:24,633
[grunting]

421
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:29,267
[man 1] This room right here.
We can still grab him. Let's go! Move!

422
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,333
[man 2] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

423
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,767
[man 3] Go!

424
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,967
[man 4] Here. Here, Jim.
Hold on. Here.

425
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:40,667
Evacuating via south face!
I got Talbot, Comstock, Riedel and Shaire.

426
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:41,900
Five men down!

427
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,033
[whirring]

428
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,633
We gotta travel together
and we gotta stay tight. Can you do that?

429
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,700
[grunting] Oh, Jesus. Go!

430
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,367
[Clyne] Come on. Come on.

431
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,633
Move. Move, move.

432
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,600
[screeching]

433
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:15,633
[grunts]

434
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:18,867
[gasps]

435
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,900
[grunts]

436
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,667
[grunts]

437
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:27,933
[man] You got him? Let's go.

438
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,800
[grunting]

439
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Get out of the way.

440
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,267
Where?

441
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,067
- Right there!
- Where is it?

442
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,333
In front.

443
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,600
We gotta get in. Move.

444
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,100
- Help him in.
- Come on!

445
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,300
- Get in here!
- In you go.

446
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:23,367
No.

447
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,200
No.

448
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:44,900
[man 1] Go, go!

449
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,333
- [man 2] Move!
- [man 3] Get in.

450
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,700
- Hey!
- [man 4] Go, go!

451
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:49,967
We're in! Go!

452
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,933
Hold on, where's Cabrera?
Where's the captain?

453
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,333
Talk to me. Did you see him?

454
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,767
- Come on, talk to me, man.
- I saw him die.

455
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,633
- What?
- I saw him die.

456
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,267
- I'm going home.
- [Fran] Yeah.

457
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,300
- I'm going home.
- Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

458
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,600
Look at me. Look at me.

459
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:18,900
- Did you see it?
- Yeah.

460
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:24,200
- You saw it. How close did you get?
- I was in a room with it for hours.

461
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,000
That tub saved my life.

462
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I could feel it.

463
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,167
[whimpers]

464
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,667
- Okay.
- I could feel it.

465
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Land mines! Hold on!

466
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:43,233
[grunting]

467
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:51,767
[grunting]

468
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,900
[grunting]

469
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,967
[coughing]

470
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,933
[coughing continues]

471
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
Hey, buddy, look at me. No, no, no.

472
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,167
Shit.

473
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,633
[man 1] Open the door.

474
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,167
[man 2] Yeah.

475
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,767
- [man 1] Come on. Now, move.
- [man 3] Come on.

476
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,100
Both drivers are dead.

477
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:53,000
Archer Lima 2. Hit a land mine.

478
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,700
Both vehicles destroyed.

479
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,167
[radio static]

480
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:57,233
We are...

481
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,700
three clicks southeast of target building.

482
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,521
[man over radio]
We are losing your transmission.

483
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:06,867
Your transponders are down.

484
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,267
No shit.
Our vehicles were just blown to hell.

485
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,600
We need to find cover.

486
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,200
- I can't hear what you're saying.
- Clyne, leave the camera.

487
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,033
[man 1] Come on, Clyne.

488
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:25,967
[man 2] Go, go, go.

489
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
[man 3] Move, move.

490
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
[man 4] Cover.

491
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,700
- Let's go.
- [man 5] Get up, get up.

492
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,133
[man 1] Come on.

493
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,733
[man 2] Go, go, go.

494
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,200
[man 4] Where you been?

495
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,333
[Sessions shouts]

496
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:47,900
Clear.

497
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,367
[Sessions] Who's injured?

498
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,733
- Diaz?
- [Diaz] I think my ankle's broke.

499
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:56,100
We need an airlift.
I can't get a signal to base. Keep trying.

500
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,900
[Talbot] Com.
Get over here. Get over here.

501
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:58,967
[man] Yeah.

502
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,200
[Talbot] Archer Lima 2. Archer Lima 2.

503
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,100
This is Dagger Team 1, over.

504
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,167
[man 1] I'm good. I'm good.

505
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,933
[man 2] Can they get in that way?

506
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:13,933
[man 3] You all right?

507
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
[Talbot]
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.

508
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,233
Do you copy? Over.

509
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:23,900
Archer Lima 2, this is Dagger Team 1.
Do you copy? Over.

510
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:26,967
Hey.

511
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,267
- How you doing? You're bleeding.
- Hmm?

512
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:37,267
Okay.

513
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,333
You hit your head.

514
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
You hit your head.

515
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,367
Did you black out?

516
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,900
Yeah, I guess so.

517
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:51,933
Major.

518
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,300
- She hit her head pretty bad.
- Let me see.

519
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:00,633
Pupils are huge.

520
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,667
Sir, I'm sending
but they're not receiving.

521
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:05,667
I'm hearing a click back
as soon as I sign over, but no answer.

522
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:06,600
Keep trying.

523
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,600
She's in shock. Keep an eye on her.

524
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,700
[Talbot] Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team 1. Do you copy? Over.

525
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,833
[man 1]... over there.

526
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,233
- Thanks.
- [man 2] Yeah.

527
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,967
Where's everyone else?
Where's the rest of Utah?

528
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm Sergeant Chen. I was with Utah.

529
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:25,367
We were the second team in last night.
There was eight of us.

530
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,833
- Do you have confirmed KIAs for Utah?
- Well, I can tell you this much.

531
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,167
Sergeant Comstock won't be
on your Christmas card this year.

532
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,267
- You saw insurgents kill Comstock?
- [Alessio] Insurgents?

533
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:39,733
Is this guy for real?

534
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:44,133
- What rock were you under?
- I was the radio operator.

535
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:47,033
We lost come.
I was stuck in the truck the whole night.

536
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,833
- I never saw the active camouflage.
- Active camouflage?

537
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,233
Even if there was a such thing,
and there's not...

538
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,767
how does a human wearing active camouflage
walk through walls?

539
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,267
[Alessio] Or through three mags
of armor-piercing ammo?

540
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,733
I saw Pat pump 150 rounds at one of them.

541
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,067
This thing's killed
at least 19 of our men.

542
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,600
And we have no idea what it is.

543
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:15,767
Clyne.

544
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
You saw it.

545
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:21,733
What was it?

546
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,233
Human.

547
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,933
Had a human form.

548
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,167
It looked at me, it was conscious.

549
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,233
Like a person.

550
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:38,767
[scoffs]

551
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,767
Is there anything that explains
what you saw?

552
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:46,033
No.

553
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Let's pull together
all the functional goggles that we have.

554
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:55,167
- My goggles were wasted in the crash, sir.
- Yeah. Mine, too. They're trashed.

555
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,733
[man] Forget the goggles.
We can't recharge them anyway.

556
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,367
So, what do we do?

557
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:01,967
How are we supposed to see them?

558
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,933
Maybe that camera can still help us.

559
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,733
If we get to an elevated position,
we'd have a better vantage point.

560
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Help me with this?

561
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,600
[Sessions] Let's go. Let's move out. Move.

562
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,667
[whirring]

563
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:36,867
[whirring]

564
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,633
[Sessions] They're everywhere.

565
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,033
[Alessio] Something's stopping them.

566
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,933
Some sort of black sand.

567
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,333
[Comstock] I fell in that sand.

568
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,933
- I had to... pick it out of my hand.
- Let me see it.

569
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,700
- Little, sharp pieces of metal.
- They're iron filings.

570
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:15,633
- It's pure iron.
- [man] Yeah.

571
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,667
And there's a trail of it...
all the way around the building.

572
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:28,367
It's a barrier. Someone put it there.

573
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:32,867
I don't think we're alone.

574
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,233
Let's stack up and sweep upstairs.

575
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Point and shoot?

576
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:42,767
Point and shoot.

577
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:21,600
[indistinct chattering]

578
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,333
Breach! Breach!

579
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,233
[screaming]

580
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:03,100
[girl speaking in foreign language]

581
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,700
- [Sessions] I've got kids.
- [man 1] Clear.

582
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,033
- [man 2] Clear.
- All clear.

583
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,100
Tell them to take the long wall.

584
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,767
Ask them where they got this,
and who else is here.

585
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,867
[speaking in foreign language]

586
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:30,733
Ask them if there's anyone else
in the factory, and do they have guns.

587
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,233
[speaking in foreign language]

588
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,200
[in English] She says they're here alone.

589
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,067
Only that one gun. No soldiers are here.

590
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,300
- No one at all.
- [man] Major Sessions.

591
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,700
- What's the problem?
- This factory has a transmission tower.

592
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:01,133
It puts out a huge signal.

593
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,033
So, what's the problem?

594
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,200
Everyone within 20 miles will hear
our conversation with base.

595
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:09,300
Any insurgent radio will pick up
our transmission.

596
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:13,700
Insurgents are the least of your worries.

597
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:15,967
Connect me to General Orland
as soon as possible.

598
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,633
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?

599
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:25,900
[radio static]

600
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:28,933
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?

601
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,633
Archer Lima 2, Archer Lima 2,
this is Dagger Team. Do you copy?

602
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,181
[Toll] You guys are our new recruits.

603
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,700
And believe me... we could use the help.

604
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,133
[both chuckling]

605
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Come on, tough guy. Show me what you got.

606
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:08,933
[grunting, then chuckling]

607
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,633
[Clyne] Hey, I need to ask you something.

608
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:17,867
Was it your idea...
to put the barrier... outside?

609
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:20,633
[speaking in foreign language]

610
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,033
[in English]
Their father. Their father knew.

611
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,200
Their father rolled open barrels
of the iron shavings around the building.

612
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:30,333
He saved their lives.

613
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:34,367
What happened to your father?

614
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,167
[Toll] You're a little scrapper,
aren't you? [Chuckling]

615
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:40,333
[grunting]

616
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,267
[Toll] Hey, buddy, you all right?
Come on, get up.

617
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
What are you doing?

618
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,167
[mimics swooshing]

619
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,333
[mimics roaring]

620
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:01,867
Are you a ghost?

621
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,000
Mm.

622
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,000
Aratare.

623
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,733
[speaks in foreign language]

624
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:08,833
- He says, "Don't say that word."
- Ask him what they are.

625
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,100
[Fran & Bogdan speaking
in foreign language]

626
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,167
[in English] Lost souls.

627
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:14,067
Souls of the dead.

628
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,233
They're trapped between life and death,
and they can't find peace.

629
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,300
How's that happen?

630
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:27,867
He says, "War."

631
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
Come on.

632
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,933
If their father put down
the iron shavings,

633
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,267
he knows more about these things
than any of us do.

634
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:49,700
Ask her where her father is.

635
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:52,267
[speaking in foreign language]

636
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,800
[speaking in foreign language]

637
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,333
[in English]
Her brother, Bogdan, doesn't know.

638
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
He thinks he went to get help.

639
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,333
He died outside,
when he was making the barrier.

640
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,700
She had to bring him in here.

641
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:37,667
I'm so sorry.

642
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,767
- Okay?
- Yeah.

643
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,067
Ceramic tile.

644
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,867
Ask her how her father knew about
the iron filings stopping the Aratare.

645
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:00,767
- What else did he know about them?
- [Fran] She doesn't know.

646
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,900
[Clyne] "Masarov."

647
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,900
- What is Masarov?
- [Fran] It's a place.

648
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:11,333
It's a district up the river.

649
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:13,167
[speaking in foreign language]

650
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,200
It's where it all began.

651
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:20,633
It's where the Aratare killings started.

652
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:22,267
Aratare.

653
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,133
I'm saying we land the helos right here.

654
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,933
Extract us from this roof
and get us the hell out of here.

655
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,767
There are power lines everywhere.
The helos would have to fly low and slow.

656
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,967
Easy pickings
for a teenager with a rocket.

657
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,767
Can you get me up to speed?
You spoke with base?

658
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,733
Yeah. The general's sending in helos
to come get us,

659
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,333
and tanks to secure the landing zone
in an open plaza

660
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,300
- about half a mile from here, at dawn.
- That's a long way on foot.

661
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,900
You think we can make it a half a mile?
With kids?

662
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:56,267
We don't have an option. Okay?
All the roads are either blocked or mined.

663
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,333
And since we used the tower
to talk to base,

664
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,867
everyone knows where we are.
We gotta move out.

665
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,167
[Alessio] You wanna go running around
with those things roaming the streets?

666
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,133
Even though we have no way to fight them?

667
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,600
[man 1] Better than waiting for them
to find a way in.

668
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,507
[Alessio] The only reason we're
still alive is that barricade out there.

669
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,233
Eventually they're gonna get through.
It's just a matter of time.

670
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,767
- [man 2] Wait.
- [Sessions] We have to take our chances.

671
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,933
- This is the best plan that we have.
- Major.

672
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:22,600
What if I said I can improve our chances
of making that plaza?

673
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,667
- I'm listening.
- Take a look around you.

674
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:28,867
Everything in this building...
is filled with this.

675
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:30,733
Iron dust.

676
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,600
And the iron stops the hyperspectrals.

677
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,700
Exactly. Weaponize it.

678
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,300
- Dirty bombs.
- Best idea I've heard all night.

679
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:41,367
Let's collect the grenades.

680
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,233
[Sessions] Clyne.

681
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:21,333
I need you to be our eyes out there.

682
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,167
- Can you haul that camera on foot?
- I've got a better idea.

683
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:28,300
This camera already projects
the right wavelength of UV light.

684
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:33,267
If I can turn it inside out, by reversing
the polarity of some of the components,

685
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:36,333
I might be able to turn it from a camera
into a searchlight.

686
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:39,067
We'll be able to see them
with our own eyes.

687
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,833
- That'd be a game-changer.
- Think I can talk to the convoy?

688
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,267
I'll them how to do the same
with their equipment.

689
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,867
When they come get us,
they're gonna need eyes, too.

690
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,767
I'll connect you
to the main engineer back at base.

691
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,167
Copy that.

692
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:12,900
They're ready to equip their vehicles
with whatever you need.

693
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,800
Can you repeat
the whole request back to me, please?

694
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,333
Okay, yes. That's correct.

695
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,967
What you need is a device that emits
a very short wavelength of light.

696
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,233
I can tell you exactly how to rewire that.

697
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:26,000
Do you have anything
you can mount on a tank?

698
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:57,100
[girl speaking in foreign language]

699
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,767
[Alessio]
We got movement across the alleyway.

700
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,700
Guys, we got movement.
Can we get eyes on it?

701
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,200
[man]
Hey, guys, stand clear for a second.

702
00:53:28,133 --> 00:53:31,200
- What's the word on the convoy?
- Last contact was 50 minutes ago.

703
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:34,000
They're on their way
to the extraction point.

704
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:04,167
Here they come! Get your gear.
We're leaving this building in 15 seconds.

705
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,800
[man] Okay, come on. Let's go.

706
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:08,667
That was the fastest way
to the extraction point.

707
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:09,967
- [girl] Yeah.
- Hey.

708
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:11,267
She says she can show us another way.

709
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:14,133
Talbot, you're with Clyne.
Diaz, you're on point.

710
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:21,800
[man] Let's go.

711
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,100
[Sessions] Yup. Moving.

712
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,067
[creatures screeching nearby]

713
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Okay, let's go.

714
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,367
Come on.

715
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Come here.

716
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:52,833
[man 1] Everybody's accounted for.

717
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,667
- [man 2] It looks clear.
- Let's move. Come here.

718
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:58,033
Okay. [Speaks in foreign language]

719
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,867
[in English] She says, "Go right, here."

720
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,867
[man 1] Hey. Heads up, 6 o'clock.

721
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:13,600
- [man 2] Move!
- Move!

722
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:14,733
Move!

723
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,200
[man 3] They're coming.

724
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:21,367
[man 4] Come on.

725
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:23,833
Come on.

726
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:35,667
Watch out!

727

[man 1] Oh, shit.

731

- [man 2] Come on, Lewis! Let's go!
- [man 3] I think it's working!

732
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:56,733
- [Sessions] In here!
- [man 1] This way.

733
00:55:58,067 --> 00:55:59,367
[man 2] Move, move.

734
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
[man 3] Go!

735
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:05,167
[grunting]

736
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,100
Go!

[screeching]

738

741
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:36,600
[Sessions] Steady your gun!

742
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,667
- [man 1] Get down!
- [man 2] Take cover, man.

743
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,000
Come on, doctor. Come on.

744
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,033

[man] I got a man down! Man down!

747
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,133
Run!

748
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:07,333
- [man 1] Moving it up!
- [man 2] More on that side!

749
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,133

"Straight ahead, under the archway."

752
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:21,733

754

- [man]Hold it.
- [Fran] She says this is the place.

755
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,033
[Sessions] Go, go.

756
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:36,233

- Get on the bus. Go.

00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,333

Come on. Come on, come on.
Work. Work. Work.

[in English] Come on. It's okay.

766
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:06,300
- [Sessions] You sure this is the place?
- [speaking in foreign language]

767
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,167
- Yeah.
- Ask them if they're sure.

768

Major.

771
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,167
This thing is dead. We can't see them.

772
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,667
We're blind.

773
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:32,167

774
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:53,600

General, go for Sessions.

01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,767
[Orland] Base has been lost!

834
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:03,200
- We're sending you to our refugee bunker!
- [Sessions] Yes, sir.

Hey, where are we going?
Base is that way.

836
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:10,767
- We're not going to base.
- Why not?

837

It's been compromised.

01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,967
[man 1] Get back!

847
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:17,600
[Sessions] Put your weapons down.

848
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:21,100
[soldiers speaking in foreign language]

849
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,867
[Sessions]
Put your weapons down! Do it now!

850
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:32,700
[Fran speaking in foreign language]

851
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:36,967
[speaking in foreign language]

852
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:41,067
He's saying, "Safe inside."

853
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,833
Hey.

854
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,067
Okay. It's okay.

855
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:00,967
[man speaking indistinctly]

856
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:03,767
Stay close.

857
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,967
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.

858
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:12,000
She's not okay. Come here.

859
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,333
I'm gonna need some room.
It's okay. It's okay.

860
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,800
[chattering in foreign language]

861
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,000
- [man] What the hell happened to base?
- Base got overrun.

862
01:07:27,067 --> 01:07:29,767
- The general is meeting us here.
- So, what is this place?

863
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,300
We're in a civilian refugee shelter.

864
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:36,000
This bunker has 20 feet
of concrete and steel.

865
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:38,933
Are we safe here? I have no idea.
But there's food and water.

866
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,067
Talbot, gather what you can.
Toll, Chen, head back to the entrance.

867
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:44,133
There's a com center.
See who you can reach.

868
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,900
Alessio, you're with me. Let's go.

869
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,200
- [Fran] There.
- Where?

870
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:50,767
- There.
- [man] Right over there.

871
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,873
- Okay.
- [man] On the bed.

872
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,933
You're okay. Shh. You're gonna be okay.

873
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,067
- [man] What happened?
- It's her shoulder.

874
01:07:57,133 --> 01:08:00,267
- Her shoulder has shrapnel in it.
- [man] We're gonna cut open her sleeve.

875
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,767
[man speaking in foreign language]

876
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,240
[woman speaking in foreign language]

877
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:11,033
[man in English] Get the IV line ready.

878
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:15,933
[Clyne] This is yours.

879
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,233
Now, I need your help, Sari,
to stop the Aratare.

880
01:08:20,733 --> 01:08:22,600
I need to know what your father knew.

881
01:08:23,067 --> 01:08:24,267
What did your father do?

882
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,133
- [speaks in foreign language]
- He worked with ceramics.

883
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,133
What did he make?

884
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,267
[Fran & Sari speaking in foreign language]

885
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:35,300
[in English] He made containers.

886
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:41,367
He made containers for Masarov.

887
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:45,333
The power plant
where the Aratare came from.

888
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,313
[man] Let's get the mask on her.

889
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:50,367
Okay, we have to take her now.

890
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,900
[rumbling]

891
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:55,267
[indistinct chattering]

892
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,667
[siren wailing]

893
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,333
- [man] This is the U.S. Armed Forces!
- Open it.

894
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,800
Lower your weapons.

895
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,967
- How many are you?
- Not many.

896
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:52,600
Let's give them a hand.

897
01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:54,967
[man 1] Let's go.

898
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,700
[man 2] Bring as much as you can.

899
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,167
[Orland] The base was overrun.

900
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:01,767
It was like a wave.

901
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,067
Invisible.

902
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:06,733
Men just started falling.

903
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,800
Our conventional weapons were useless.

904
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,667
I requested an order
to evacuate the base...

905
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,100
but our long-range come
are completely scrambled.

906
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:18,900
So, I took all the gear I could.

907
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:22,033
I started sending units north
out of the area of operation.

908
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,933
Kept five aircraft
with the least amount of fuel,

909
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,367
stayed behind with one platoon.

910
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:33,333
Out of the 240 of us,
we have 19 remaining.

911
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:38,967
[Sessions] Did you get a message
to higher command?

912
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
[Orland] No.

913
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,633
- Is there a rescue mission planned?
- No. We intercepted radio chatter

914
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,800
from Moldovan friendlies
to find this place.

915
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,167
We sent that bird to pick you up
and bring you here.

916
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,700
If you'd even tried to return to base,
you'd be dead.

917
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:56,200
We're the last U.S. forces in the country?

918
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,167
I hope so.

919
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,667
So, what's the plan, sir?

920
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,600
Came here to regroup, major.

921
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,333
There's no plan.

922
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,800
- I recommend we fortify the entrance.
- Fortify with what?

923
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:17,700
- We wait till a rescue mission...
- Fortify with what?

924
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:19,667
They'll come through whatever you use.

925
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:23,600
- We need to take our chances on a helo...
- There's 20 minutes of flight time!

926
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:26,100
Twenty minutes of flight time
in those birds. Not more!

927
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,333
There's not enough room
for all of us anyway.

928
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,033
We need to form teams
and take the aircraft.

929
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,000
But where you gonna go, major?

930
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:35,600
You can't run from them.

931
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,067
You can't stop them.
Your weapons are useless.

932
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,900
We have no idea what they are!

933
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:45,167
[man 1] If they come through
that door, we're sitting ducks.

934
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:47,233
[man 2] We can't stop them!
We can't stop them!

935
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,833
[indistinct chattering]

936
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,233
[man 3] Take what we can and go.

937
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:58,833
I know what they are.

938
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:04,133
I know what they are.

939
01:12:05,967 --> 01:12:07,067
I know what they are.

940
01:12:07,767 --> 01:12:08,967
[chattering stops]

941
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,367
We think we're seeing things.

942
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:15,800
We think it can't be real, but it kills.
So, it is real.

943
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:17,367
It's something.

944
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,300
It's not light, it's not shadow,

945
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:21,900
or some trick of the mind.
Pass through walls, check.

946
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:24,967
Outside the visible spectrum, check.

947
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,700
Kills to the touch, check.

948
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:32,800
Comstock. He was under a ceramic bathtub,
is that right?

949
01:12:34,133 --> 01:12:36,333
Tank armor.
It couldn't pass through tank armor.

950
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,367
M1 Abrams tank armor,
that's ceramic plating everywhere.

951
01:12:39,633 --> 01:12:42,600
It cannot pass through ceramic.
You know what that means?

952
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,200
It means this stuff isn't natural.

953
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:47,767
Someone made it.

954
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,633
It's man-made.

955
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,000
Man-made how?

956
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,933
Okay. You have solid, liquid, gas.
Lava can turn into rock.

957
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,067
Ice can turn into water. Metals can melt.
These are natural states.

958
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:05,200
But there are unnatural states.
Artificial states, man-made states.

959
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:07,767
Condensate.

960
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:10,100
Bose-Einstein condensate.

961
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:13,933
A state of matter that was predicted
by Nath Bose and Albert Einstein.

962
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,833
It has some very unusual properties.
It can be slowed down by iron filings.

963
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,033
It cannot pass through ceramic,
but it can pass through walls.

964
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,600
It's so cold it will kill you instantly
on contact.

965
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,700
It can do everything
we've been seeing here.

966
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:29,333
To create Bose-Einstein condensate,
you need power, and you need a lot of it.

967
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,233
Masarov. The power plant.

968
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,233
Yes, Masarov. Where they were made.

969
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,300
You said this country was pouring billions
into weapons research.

970
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:38,067
This is a weapon.

971
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,033
- And it was set loose, or it broke loose.
- All right, but these things climb.

972
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
They're like humans.
It looks like a person.

973
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:47,200
So can marble and clay in the right hands.

974
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:48,333
And I wanna know why.

975
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,333
Why they look like people.
I can't tell you how they did this.

976
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,633
What I can tell you...
is that someone made them.

977
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,700
If someone made them, they don't escape
the laws of the world. Nothing does.

978
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,800
It shines light on new laws,
and that's what we have to learn.

979
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:04,600
- They have order and structure.
- They can be broken down.

980
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,300
Anything can be. It's just energy.
And since I know what they are,

981
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,333
- I can build the right weapons.
- What kind of weapons?

982
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,133
Plasmic-discharge.
They can tear apart the condensate.

983
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:18,133
- Where will we find weapons like that?
- We're gonna build them.

984
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,100
- Build them with what?
- Anything we can find in this bunker.

985
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:23,700
Anything with electronics.
Optics, ballistic casings.

986
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,667
All the gear you brought from base.

987
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:28,233
We can take it all apart,
and I can build an arsenal.

988
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,900
And then we can go to Masarov
and stop this before it goes any further.

989
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,633
Because if we don't, the condensate
will feed on all the energy in its path.

990
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:37,067
It'll grow exponentially.

991
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,900
There's no limit
to how far they can spread.

992
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,667
Unless we stop them.

993
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,633
[man 1]
Let's get this gear inside, guys. Come on.

994
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,833
[man 2] Let's move!

995
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,267
[man 1] Same number each side.

996
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,833
[man 2] All right, let's go, boys!

997
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,100
[indistinct yelling]

998
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,000
[man 1] Any med patches in there?

999
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:27,800
[man 2]
We got three of them over here.

1000
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:31,667
It's a ground-to-air tracking scope.
We can use this. They have good optics.

1001
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
- Good. This is good.
- [man 1] Two more over there.

1002
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:36,767
[man 2] See that 305?

1003
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,933
Half of these are labeled "defective."
We need a voltage counter.

1004
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,600
I want you to start testing these.

1005
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,233
[man 1] All right, open it up.

1006
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,767
[man 2] Get that one open. Pop it.

1007
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:55,233
Is that what I think it is?

1008
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,933
[man 1] We got the lotus from base.

1009
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
[Alessio] That's badass.

1010
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,133
- Looks like a mechanical Rottweiler.
- Look at that.

1011
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,067
Clyne's making a few changes.

1012
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:07,067
[Alessio] They're taking down a chain
hoist and putting up a searchlight.

1013
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:08,967
Dj vu.

1014
01:17:14,867 --> 01:17:18,000
- What does it fire?
- It's a focused energy pulse.

1015
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:20,033
If my math is right...

1016
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,600
[whirring]

1017
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:23,967
It should break down condensate.

1018
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,300
[Orland] Masarov.

1019
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,733
The single largest power plant
in the region.

1020
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:41,200
It's where the killings started.
If they're man-made, they were made here.

1021
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:43,067
It's less than ten clicks from here.

1022
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:47,367
Our birds can make that,
but... it's probably one way.

1023
01:17:48,067 --> 01:17:51,833
I've been digging for clues with
the civilians. I found intel on Masarov.

1024
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,167
It's been retrofitted several times
over the last decade

1025
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,667
by the central regime.

1026
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,967
It's got "weapons research"
written all over it.

1027
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:01,733
Okay, you and Clyne need to be
embedded to infiltrate.

1028
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,333
It's up to the both of you
to figure out how to stop this.

1029
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
We have to create a diversion.

1030
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:10,267
We'll draw them out here
so you can infiltrate the structure

1031
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,000
and try to find the source.

1032
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,133
Clyne's predicting the charge from these
will be extremely hot.

1033
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,967
Enough to destroy condensate.

1034
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,933
We'll find out soon enough.

1035
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,833
All right, boys.

1036
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:30,733
This is it.

1037
01:18:32,267 --> 01:18:33,767
If you have any last words...

1038
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:35,633
now's the time.

1039
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
[guns cocking]

1040
01:19:03,733 --> 01:19:05,000
[Orland] All right, listen up.

1041
01:19:05,933 --> 01:19:07,967
You are using untested weapons...

1042
01:19:09,267 --> 01:19:12,867
against an enemy that, to this point,
has been unstoppable.

1043
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,867
Now, you are heading
into unknown territory.

1044
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:19,300
And hear me when I say you're gonna
see things you will not understand.

1045
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,733
Our enemy has spread through the city
in a matter of days.

1046
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:25,633
There's no telling
how far they will spread...

1047
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:27,333
unless we fight back.

1048
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:33,933
Most men never even come close...
to changing the future.

1049
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,167
This is the place.

1050
01:19:40,267 --> 01:19:41,867
And now is the time.

1051
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:46,600
Make no mistake,
you're the last line of defense.

1052
01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:51,833
Let's go do what we came here to do.

1053
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:54,933
[guns cocking, then powering up]

1054
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:08,167
[man] Let's go, let's go!

1055
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:11,967

1056
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:53,767
[sighs]

1057
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,900
One minute.

1058
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,167
[Sessions] Thirty seconds.

1059
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:14,833
[man] Spearhead 1, proceed with descent.

1060
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:26,367
[man] All right, let's go.

1061
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,100
[man] Here we go.

1062
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,733
[whirring]

1063
01:22:07,733 --> 01:22:09,200
[powering up]

1064
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
Let's move!

1065
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,667
[man over radio] We have a visual.

1066
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:22,767
Hostile target gathering at 12 o'clock
on east end of platform.

1067
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:25,667
[man] Move, move!

1068
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:32,667
[whirring]

1069
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,967
[man over radio] We are a go.

1070
01:22:37,133 --> 01:22:38,800
[powering up]

1071
01:23:29,633 --> 01:23:31,067
I have a confirmed spectral kill.

1072
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:34,767
We're a go. I say again, all units go.

1073
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:37,333
- Let's show them what we've got.
- Come on.

1074
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,767
- [man 1] This is it!
- [man 2] Let's do it!

1075
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:39,933
[man 3] Let's go. Drop.

1076
01:23:41,133 --> 01:23:43,767
[man 1 over radio] Copy, Spearhead 1.
All units engage.

1077
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:46,387
[man 2 over radio]
Spearhead 2 taking north peninsula.

1078
01:23:47,867 --> 01:23:50,667
[man 3 over radio] Spearhead 3 beginning
descent over south peninsula.

1079
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,667
[man 4 over radio]
At least a dozen targets coming out.

1080
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:56,000
- [man 1] Go! Go!
- [man 2] Let's move!

1081
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:58,900
- [man 3] On me!
- [man] All units, you are clear to engage.

1082
01:23:59,933 --> 01:24:01,133
- [man 4] Move in!
- Move it!

1083
01:24:02,233 --> 01:24:03,367
[indistinct yelling]

1084
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:04,800
[man 5] Lock and load.

1085
01:24:04,867 --> 01:24:06,147
- [man 6] Move out.
- Let's move.

1086
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,733
[man 7] Right behind you!

1087
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,521
[man over radio]
Weapons free! Weapons free!

1088
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:12,167
[man 8] Let's go. Move up!

1089
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:15,233
- [man 9] Move!
- [man 10] Come on!

1090
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,733
- [man 11] I said go, go, go!
- [man 12] Move!

1091
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:26,067
[man over radio] Spearhead 2, you're go
for infield. Proceed to insertion point.

1092
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:32,133
Go, go, go!

1093
01:25:27,867 --> 01:25:28,867
[gasps]

1094
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,900
[man] Get down!

1095
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:33,833
[roaring]

1096
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
Right there.

1097
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:57,300
- Toll!
- Go! Go!

1098
01:25:58,667 --> 01:25:59,933
Go, go, go!

1099
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,600
[man 1] Go, go, go!

1100
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,000
- [man 2] Somebody get on top!
- [man 3] Down right there!

1101
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,367
- [man 4] We got more incoming!
- Keep formation!

1102
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:15,633
[man 5] Let's move it!

1103
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,267
[man 6] Fight! Fight!

1104
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
[man 7] Move!

1105
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:30,067
- [man 8] Let's go, go, go!
- [man 9] Go, John!

1106
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,833
[man]
Do we have a sit-rep? Right now.

1107
01:26:36,133 --> 01:26:38,600
[Sessions]
Clyne, what's the situation down there?

1108
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,733
Sessions, we got split up.

1109
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,600
- We're still looking for the lab.
- We're holding. Don't know how long.

1110
01:26:45,067 --> 01:26:47,833
- Do you copy?
- Can you hear me? Sessions?

1111
01:26:51,267 --> 01:26:52,267
We gotta keep going.

1112
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,067
[Fran] We gotta be close now.

1113
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,800
[beeping]

1114
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,033

1115
01:27:31,933 --> 01:27:33,067
[Fran] God.

1116
01:27:47,867 --> 01:27:48,900
Look over here.

1117
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,667
[Clyne] Bose-Einstein condensate.

1118
01:28:06,033 --> 01:28:07,200
Look at these x-rays.

1119
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,333
They were scanning people.
On a molecular level.

1120
01:28:17,233 --> 01:28:22,300
[whirring]

1121
01:28:22,967 --> 01:28:24,800
And printing them out of condensate.

1122
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,033
It's an assembly line.

1123
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,267
Like some kind of...

1124
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:38,000
industrial process.

1125
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:39,767
You're right.

1126
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,800
It's a weapon.

1127
01:29:02,867 --> 01:29:04,367
[all whimpering]

1128
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,000
[whimpering continues]

1129
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,133
What happened here?

1130
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,100
It looks like a catastrophic failure.

1131
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,633
Half the cells are broken and empty.

1132
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,067
Some structural failure
must have set them free.

1133
01:29:27,133 --> 01:29:28,600
Opened up Pandora's Box.

1134
01:29:29,733 --> 01:29:30,733
Now what?

1135
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,800
[man 1] Incoming!

1136
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,100

[whimpering]

1138
01:29:48,267 --> 01:29:49,633
Hey!

1139
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,767
Hey, 12 o'clock!

1140
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,933
- [man 1] Do it!
- [man 2] They're coming back!

1141
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
- [man 3] They're moving!
- [man 1 over radio] All eyes on target.

1142
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:06,767
- One of them is reforming.
- [man 2 over radio] Bring it down!

"Top research advisers
of the central regime."

1145
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:34,367
This man was trying to stop it.
They did lose control.

1146
01:30:36,233 --> 01:30:37,633
Can you translate this?

1147
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:44,133
[whirring]

1148
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,633
It's an emergency shutdown procedure.
Half these words I've never seen.

1149
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,867
What about the other half?

Disconnect the umbilicals to, uh...
interrupt the... neural activity."

1154
01:31:08,267 --> 01:31:11,667
- Okay.
- So, you gotta unlock all these ports.

1155
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:15,200
And then you gotta pull this bracket here
to release all the cables.

1156
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,000
And then?

1157
01:31:17,767 --> 01:31:18,900
That should stop them.

01:34:34,233 --> 01:34:35,367
[grunts]

1185
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:38,933
[Clyne mumbles]

1186
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,833
[Fran panting]

1187
01:35:43,733 --> 01:35:46,067
- Is it over?
- I don't know.

1188
01:36:24,267 --> 01:36:25,300
Can you walk?

1189
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:29,633
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

1190
01:36:30,233 --> 01:36:31,700
We have to find a way out.

1191
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:34,100
[whirring]

1192
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,333
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

1193
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
[Clyne] This is it.

1194
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,600
They weren't just scanning people.

1195
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,033
They're not just printouts.

1196
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,900
This is what's controlling them.

1197
01:37:09,933 --> 01:37:11,334
[Fran] These are from real corpses.

1198
01:37:12,367 --> 01:37:14,633
[Clyne]
Each one is made from a real person.

1199
01:37:16,667 --> 01:37:17,700
They're alive?

1200
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:19,833
They're not alive.

1201
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:23,967
They're not dead.

1202
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,700
They're just trapped somewhere in between.

1203
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:34,367
But they are in pain.

1204
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,200
How do you know?

1205
01:37:38,267 --> 01:37:39,633
This is pain.

1206
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,267
But how do you know they can feel?

1207
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:46,867
I can't prove it.

1208
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:49,700
I can't.

1209
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:58,033
So, maybe there are things
science can't answer.

1210
01:37:59,867 --> 01:38:00,933
[powering down]

1211
01:38:12,633 --> 01:38:13,633
No.

1212
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:15,100
Wait, no.

1213
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,167
This is why we came here.

1214
01:38:19,167 --> 01:38:22,100
This is the evidence.
This is why you came, remember?

1215
01:38:23,033 --> 01:38:25,833
Remember?
So many people have died. You said it.

1216
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,233
- You said, "I wanna know why."
- I know enough.

1217
01:38:29,967 --> 01:38:31,967
You have to think about
the bigger picture.

1218
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:35,900
I am.

1219
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,100
[powering down]

1220
01:39:30,233 --> 01:39:31,700
[man 1] Help them off single file.

1221
01:39:32,867 --> 01:39:33,947
[man 2] Got more coming in!

1222
01:39:34,933 --> 01:39:36,233
[man 3] Put them in Unit 5.

1223
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:39,327
- [man 4] Over here. Over here.
- [man 5] Watch his neck.

1224
01:39:39,367 --> 01:39:42,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1225
01:39:50,633 --> 01:39:51,674
[man 6] Give me your hand.

1226
01:39:56,133 --> 01:39:57,133
[man 7] Right there, sir.

1227
01:39:57,967 --> 01:39:58,967
[man 8] Welcome back.

1228
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,300
[man 9] You okay?

1229
01:40:18,633 --> 01:40:20,233
[indistinct chattering]

1230
01:40:37,633 --> 01:40:38,633
New survey teams.

1231
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:41,767
They're gonna take Masarov apart
piece by piece.

1232
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,700
Measure everything.

1233
01:40:45,267 --> 01:40:46,933
Try to reverse-engineer it.

1234
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:48,967
Fight over ownership.

1235
01:40:50,267 --> 01:40:53,767
I've been asked if you wanna
go back out there. I said I'd ask, but...

1236
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:56,100
I've seen what I came to see.

1237
01:41:01,933 --> 01:41:03,700
[indistinct chattering]

1238
01:41:14,133 --> 01:41:15,633
They don't stop, do they?

1239
01:41:16,633 --> 01:41:17,900
I don't think they know how.

1240
01:41:34,633 --> 01:41:36,167
[indistinct chattering]

1241
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:45,300
I told you you'd go home to Virginia
without unpacking.

1242
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,700
[man] Delta Unit, move out.

1243
01:41:49,867 --> 01:41:50,987
[speaks in foreign language]

1244
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:52,800
[in English] Thank you.
