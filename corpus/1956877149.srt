00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:25,341
Colonel Joll?

10
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,955
It's an honor to have you here.

11
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,934
Well, you... you must
be exhausted. Please.

[horse neighs]

13
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:08,317
Tell me, i-if you
don't mind me asking,

14
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,320
what... what are they for?

15
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,855
They protect one's eyes

16
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,458
against the glare of the sun.

17
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,194
They save one from squinting.

18
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,030
- Ah.
- Do you see?

19
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,332
No wrinkles.

20
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,866
[chuckles]

21
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,335
Fewer headaches.

22
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,838
Yes, at home,
everyone is wearing them.

23
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,942
You would find them useful

24
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,143
out here in the desert.

25
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,411
Hmm.

26
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:43,818
Are you familiar with
these parts of the frontier?

27
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:45,820
No.

28
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,924
Not with this part, no.

29
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:53,996
With the south,
but not with this part, not yet.

30
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,798
Well, it's not a good time
of the year to visit.

31
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,901
You must feel the heat.

32
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,203
I'm quite used to it, the heat.

33
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,241
I have leave due to me,

34
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:09,245
but I-I find myself
reluctant to take it.

35
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,447
One grows to be
a part of a place.

36
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:17,987
I'd feel like a foreigner
if I went back to the capital.

37
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,356
And the capital,
too, has changed,

38
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,126
I'm sure, since my time.

39
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:27,129
I need to make an early start
of my inspection.

40
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,465
Breakfast early, please,
first thing.

41
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,832
Yes, sir.

42
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:33,102
So if you will excuse me,

43
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,137
I need to get some rest.

44
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:39,008
I'll come by in the morning
and fetch you.

45
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,885

[rooster crows]

49
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,550
[baker] But a soldier?

50
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,218
They... They don't
usually send soldiers

51
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:24,420
on inspections, do they?

52
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,588
Mm, who's the inspector now?

53
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:27,990
[both laugh]

54
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,325
You're far too inquisitive,
my friend.

55
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,626
No, he's not a soldier.

56
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,860
He wears a uniform,
but he's not a soldier.

57
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,064
He's a policeman,
a colonel of the police,

58
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:39,335
very important person from
the Bureau of State Security.

59
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:42,371
Once in every generation,

60
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:45,307
without fail,
along the frontier,

61
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:50,879
there is an episode of hysteria
about the barbarians.

62
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:54,249
It's the consequence
of too much ease.

63
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,318
Why don't they leave us alone?

64
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:59,188
They have their own territories,
don't they?

65
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,457
We have to protect ourselves.

66
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,025
Protect ourselves, my dear?

67
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:05,327
Against what? Against whom?

68
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,628
Against them.

69
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,897
We protect ourselves
against wild animals,

70
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,499
against snakes.

71
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,435
If an angry bear
approaches you,

72
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,137
you'd kill it, Magistrate,
wouldn't you?

73
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,106
[laughs] No, my friends.

74
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,241
I-I will be quite content

75
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:22,344
to pass quietly away
and merit no more

76
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,447
than three lines
in the imperial gazette

77
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:28,317
that with nudge here
and a touch there,

78
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,153
I kept the world
on its course.

79
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,923
[insects chirping]

80
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,254
We ready to go?

81
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:18,133
I must tell you
that we don't have

82
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,169
proper facilities
for prisoners.

83
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,603
There's no need.

84
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:24,573
There's not much...
There's not much crime here,

85
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:29,211
and the penalty's usually
a fine or compulsory labor,

86
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:31,346
so we simply use
the old barracks.

87
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,450
[chuckles] Where we
also store provisions.

88
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,057
Just a minute.

89
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,493
Let me speak with them.

90
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,995
I know a little of the language.

91
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,609
[speaking local language]

92
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,424
I think it must be your glasses.

93
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:19,228
He's probably never
seen anything like them before.

94
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,997
[chuckles]
He may think that you're blind.

95
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:30,372
[speaking local language]

96
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,614
Hmm?

97
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,148
Do you understand?

98
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,253
Show the Excellency.

99
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,195
- [raspy breath]
- Hmm.

100
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,597
It's his sister's boy.

101
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,166
They've come to get medicine.

102
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,440
...Excellency.

103
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,310
All right.

104
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:42,311
Thank you.

105
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,114
- [speaking local language]
- Whatever you call it,

106
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,850
banditry, sheep stealing,

107
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:52,387
it really...
it doesn't amount to much.

108
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,324
These nomads,
barbarians, if you will,

109
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,793
will be gone in a month
back up into the mountains.

110
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:01,196
They migrate.
They're always on the move.

111
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:02,831
He says he came for medicine.

112
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:05,902
He may be telling the truth.
Who knows?

113
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:09,504
Who would have brought
an old man and a sick boy

114
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:11,206
along on a raiding party?

115
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,609
Nevertheless,
I will question them.

116
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,779
You can learn surprising things.

117
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:20,816
I'll bring one of my men along,

118
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,485
and I will need someone
to assist with the language.

119
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,621
Well, let me.
I-I'd be glad to help.

120
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,622
No, no.

121
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:28,590
You would find it tedious.

122
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:32,527
We have set procedures.

123
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:38,467
Uh, tell me,
wh-what are your procedures?

124
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,738
Patience...

125
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:45,574
and pressure.

126
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:50,412
That is the only way
to get to the truth.

127
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:52,614
But how do you know

128
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,416
you are hearing the truth?

129
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,354
There is a certain tone.

130
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,292
A certain tone enters the voice.

131
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,767
You come to recognize it
with training and experience.

132
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:17,839
Can you tell
whether I am telling the truth?

133
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:22,778
You misunderstand.

134
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,681
I am speaking
of particular situations,

135
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:29,184
situations where I
am probing for the truth.

136
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,523
First you get lies.

137
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:37,994
First lies,

138
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,828
then pressure,

139
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,830
then more lies,

140
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,532
then more pressure...

141
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:48,637
then more lies, more pressure...

142
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:52,641
and then comes the break.

143
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,212
After the break,
more pressure...

144
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:03,852
and then at last the truth.

145
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,224
That is how you get it.

146
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,861
Pain is truth.

147
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,264
All else is subject to doubt.

148
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:22,504
No, that one says
that the very same pig

149
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:24,773
keeps breaking in to his garden
and damaging the produce,

150
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:26,641
and now he's not going
to give it back

151
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:27,676
until he's paid compensation.

152
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:34,316
Excellency, the pig
is worth a lot of money.

153
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,285
His garden is worth nothing,
nothing.

154
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,654
It's a nothing
that has no proper fence.

155
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,790
- Be quiet. Be quiet.
- [door opens]

156
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:44,793
Everybody knows that he
doesn't have a proper title.

157
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,062
He can't put up a fence,

158
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,363
because he doesn't have
a proper title.

159
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,299
- Come on. Show him your title.
- Just be quiet, please.

160
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,335
- [boots echoing]
- Sir...

161
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:56,005
if I can speak
to the Excellency?

162
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:59,307
I have warned him many times
about his pig,

163
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,510
and he pays no attention.

164
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,645
Why must I suffer for his pig?

165
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,749
"His pig." You have his pig.

166
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,417
I have his pig,

167
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,320
and I am keeping it
until he pays for the damages.

168
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,589
Why should I pay?
Who says I should pay?

169
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,458
Give him back his pig.

170
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,727
And?

171
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:23,799
And that is all.

172
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:48,390
[sifter shakes]

173
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,330
Sir.

174
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,347
[brushing]

175
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,551
- Your bed's ready, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,955
- Anything more?
- No, thank you.

177
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:23,558
What is that?

178
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:27,462
This is... It's a child's shoe
from long ago.

179
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:28,965
- Shoe?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,867
You're gonna keep it?

181
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:34,636
Mm-hmm.

182
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,906
[sighs]

What does it say?

185
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,987
I have no idea.

186
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,090
It's old writing...

187
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,825
from the old days.

188
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,963
No one writes like this anymore.

[flies buzzing]

199
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,100
Close it.

200
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,936
Close it. Close it.

201
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:26,641
Tie it shut.

202
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,084
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

- What have they done to him?

205
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,019
A knife.

206
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,022
Just a little knife like this.

Ah. He wants water.
Give it to him.

And...

212
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:36,778
have that removed,
taken out of here immediately.

213
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,986
And what does this mean?

214
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,720
It means...

215
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:49,225
that we have
our first confession,

216
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:52,727
means that I am doing
what I was sent here to do.

217
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,197
It means that we are
beginning to understand

218
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,199
what is going on
on the border.

219
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,436
Today we have
the beginnings of information

220
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,073
and now are in the position
to go out and gather more.

221

- First thing tomorrow morning,

I shall be taking out

yes, that same boy...
as my guide.

224
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,317
I think he will be a good guide.

225
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,652
He knows by now what I want.

226
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,791
As for you, it would be helpful

227
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,827
if you would put together
some pack animals

228
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,863
and some provisions
for a week or so

229
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:29,965

good men
familiar with the country.

231
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,740
What kind of information,
sheep stealing? Smuggling?

232
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:41,977
Are you killing old men
for sheep now?

233
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,789

Come away. Come away.

235
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:23,419
Did you really tell the officer
that your clan is arming itself?

236
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,255
Did you really say
that there will be

237
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:29,225
a great war against the Empire?

238
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:30,926
It's stupid.

239
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,028

[Magistrate]
W-With no disrespect, Colonel,

244
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,378
you've never campaigned on this
inhospitable frontier before

245
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,415
You have no guide except a child
who's terrified of you.

246
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:55,117
As for them,
you cannot rely on them.

247
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,952
They're conscripts.
Most of them have never been

248
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:58,954
more than five miles
from this settlement.

249
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:01,190
The barbarians
whom you are chasing will...

250
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,825
will vanish into the desert
before you catch sight of them.

251
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,494
They live here.
This is their land.

252
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:08,097
They know every inch of it.
You do not.

253
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,864
I have orders to obey.

254
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:14,136
May I remind you, Colonel,
that if you get lost,

255
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,139
it will be up to me to find you

256
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:20,142
and bring you back
to civilization.

257
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:21,210
Of course.

258
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,948
Don't stake your life
on my maps, sir.

259
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:27,349
I'm not a surveyor.

260
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:28,816
I patched them together

261
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,919

by travelers.

262

I've never been
where you're going.

not to go.

Why can't you just...

Why can't you just leave, um...

00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,527

Yes, we have completed

Now I must hurry back
and make my report.

to facilita...

among the nomad peoples...

319
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:57,699
have they been successful?

320
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,035
Yes.

321
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:02,871
I think I can say
we've had some success,

322
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,673
particularly when you consider

323
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:07,442
that this is only part
of a great enterprise.

324
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,913
Similar investigations
are being carried out

in a very coordinated fashion

with the cooperation

327
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:19,354
of the various
frontier administrators.

328
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,591
Well, that is good.

329
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:28,830
And is it too early to reveal

330
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:34,803
whether we have anything to fear
from these barbarians this year?

331
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:42,677
May we still sleep securely
in our beds?

of the imagination

334

of the frontier...

will be taken.

out of here!

00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:42,178
This is how I look.

368
00:36:46,648 --> 00:36:49,218
[wind blowing]

369
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,598
Where do you live?

370
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:07,169
I live.

371
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:12,740
We do not permit vagrants
in the town.

372
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:16,412
You must have somewhere to live.

373
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,813
Otherwise, you must go
back to your own people.

374
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:19,882
Do you understand?

375
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,621
Well...

376
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:32,128
I offer that you should...

377
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:36,631
come and work here.

378
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:46,008
Um, either that
or go back to your people.

379
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:49,811
You cannot beg in the street.

380
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,213
I cannot permit that.

381
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:54,383
You must have a place to live.

382
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:58,254
If you work here...

383
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,824
you can sleep here, too.

384
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:14,904
I can go?

385
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:18,740
Yes, go if you want to.

386
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:30,152
[breathing heavily]

387
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,707
[soft chatter]

388
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,836
Come. Come inside.

389
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,345
[fire crackling]

390
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:33,949
Let me see.

391
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:58,240
They broke it.

392
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,945
My, um...

393
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:05,014
[speaks local word]

394
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:06,148
Your ankle.

395
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:07,349
My ankle.

396
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,387
Other one, too.

397
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:20,356
[water splashes]

398
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:32,935
[water splashes]

399
00:41:56,358 --> 00:41:57,292
[Magistrate gasps]

400
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:07,903
[murmurs]

401
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,654
[girl sighs]

402
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,190
[chuckles]

403
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:32,161
[chuckling]

404
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:39,635
[birds chirping]

405
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,939
[embers crackling]

406
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,376
Welcome, sir.

407
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,478
The Magistrate's waiting.

408
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:23,979
- Thank you.
- Company, halt.

409
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:27,983
Cheers.

410
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:35,557
So no trouble
on the way here, then?

411
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:36,725
Nothing.

412
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:38,260
Nothing worth mentioning.

413
00:43:38,293 --> 00:43:41,230
I think we were followed
for a while by barbarians,

414
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:42,331
but that was all.

415
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:46,401
Are you sure
they were barbarians?

416
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:49,004
[chuckles]
What else could they have been?

417
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:53,442
At brigade headquarters,
they're saying

418
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:54,776
there is to be
a general offensive

419
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,778
against the barbarians
in the spring.

420
00:43:56,812 --> 00:44:00,716
The plan is to move them back
all along the frontier,

421
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:02,484
back into the mountains.

422
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:05,454
[laughs] They can't be serious.

423
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:08,790
The people who... whom you
call barbarians are nomads.

424
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,726
They will never
permit themselves

425
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,794
to be bottled up
in the mountains.

426
00:44:12,828 --> 00:44:15,764
Well, sorry to be frank.

427
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:18,100
Isn't that what war is about?

428
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:22,404
Compelling a choice on someone
who would not otherwise make it?

429
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:32,614
Ah.

430
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:37,085
Mm-hmm.

431
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:43,792
Tell me, sir, as someone
who knows the region...

432
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:47,796
why are these barbarians
so dissatisfied?

433
00:44:49,364 --> 00:44:51,133
What is all the trouble about?

434
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:57,272
Well, what is the trouble about?

435
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:02,644
Ahem. Well, there was no trouble
that... that I know of...

436
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,648
until outsiders
started interfering.

437
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,751
We had peace.

438
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:12,454
We kept to ourselves.
They kept to themselves.

439
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:16,358
But it's... it's all changed now.

440
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:21,463
It will take years
to patch up the damage

441
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:25,133
that Colonel Joll did
in the space of a week.

442
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:27,803
[chuckles]

443
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:28,905
[laughs] You smile,

444
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:31,106
but, uh,
I'll tell you something.

445
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,576
We, you and I,

446
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,915
think of this country as ours,
as part of the Empire.

447
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:42,851
We say to ourselves we reclaimed
the land from the desert,

448
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:45,354
we planted it,
we built our homes here,

449
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:47,189
but that's not how they see it.

450
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:52,327
They still see us
as visitors, transients.

451
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:55,731
They say to one another,
"Be patient.

452
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:59,301
One day, these foreigners
will pack up and leave."

453
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:01,870
[chuckles] "They will
never last in the desert."

454
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,440
But we're not going to leave.

455
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,645
No?

456
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:13,682
Are you sure?

457
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:16,785
The frontier towns are the first
line of defense of the Empire,

458
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:20,489
so th-there's no question
of abandoning them.

459
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:26,862
- [spoon scraping]
- [chewing]

460
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,813
[water splashing]

461
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:24,653
[soft crying]

462
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:01,256
[Magistrate sighs]

463
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:18,975
What do you think
they're doing up there?

464
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:21,276
What do you think? The usual.

465
00:48:23,545 --> 00:48:25,747
Doesn't usually
bring girls up there.

466
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,951
He's strict about that.

467
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:30,485
Well, he's getting old.

468
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,756
Ah, he's still
a very good-looking man.

469
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,292
Have you got your eye on him?

470
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,096
Have you got your eye on him,
Grandma?

471
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:41,563
- [laughs]
- That's enough now.

472
00:48:41,596 --> 00:48:43,431
Come on. Bed.

473
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:44,699
Oh! [laughs]

474
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:46,501
That's it. Bedtime.

475
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,745
[scrubbing]

476
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,817
[tub clangs]

477
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:08,757
- Towel.
- Huh? Towl.

478
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,358
- Towel.
- Tow... Towel.

479
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:11,961
- Towel.
- Towel.

480
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,029
Tow-el.

481
00:49:13,062 --> 00:49:14,030
Towel?

482
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:15,530
- Towel.
- Towel.

483
00:49:15,564 --> 00:49:17,332
[laughing]

484
00:49:21,403 --> 00:49:22,871
Can you come up, please?

485
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:26,541
Now?

486
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:28,810
Yes. Yes, now, in a minute.

487
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:02,377
Wh-What is that?

488
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,814
It's where they touch me.

489
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:08,717
Where they touched you?

490
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:14,823
D-Does it hurt?

491
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,097
What did they do to you?

492
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:25,734
Tell me.

493
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:48,723
[humming a melody]

494
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:10,445
[humming ends]

495
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,256
In his report,
Colonel Joll wrote

496
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:24,894
that one of the prisoners
died afterwards.

497
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:27,762
Do you remember that prisoner?

498
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:33,035
Do you know what they
did to him, who he was?

499
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:35,804
We heard he went crazy

500
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:36,871
and attacked them.

501
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,176
And?

502
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:44,479
He attacked them.

503
00:51:46,781 --> 00:51:48,683
We had to take him out
afterwards.

504
00:51:49,718 --> 00:51:51,020
He was breathing strangely,

505
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:53,555
very deep and very fast.

506
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:56,858
Then he died the next day.

507
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:01,730
He was the one they questioned
the longest, sir.

508
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,867
He had someone with him?

509
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:08,904
His daughter.

510
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:14,877
His daughter.

511
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:19,315
What happened to her?

512
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,883
She was questioned, too.

513
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:23,252
I heard her crying.

514
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:25,854
She was in pain.

515
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:29,524
They broke her feet, I think.

516
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:34,096
Did they do that
in... in front of him,

517
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,764
in front of her father?

518
00:52:35,797 --> 00:52:37,166
Yes, sir.

519
00:52:40,036 --> 00:52:42,804
They did something
to her eyes, didn't they?

520
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:47,043
Sir, there were a lot
of prisoners to take care of.

521
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,779
I-I know she had
a bad time with her feet,

522
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:52,281
but the eyes...

523
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:55,717
we didn't know about that
'til later.

524
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:02,291
[water splashing]

525
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:05,294
You should have told me.

526
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,533
You should tell me everything.

527
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,178
[water sloshes]

528
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:26,916
[taps]

529
00:53:32,787 --> 00:53:33,855
[sighs]

530
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:58,314
[breathing heavily]

531
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,210
And this...

532
00:54:37,887 --> 00:54:39,155
It was a fork.

533
00:54:40,456 --> 00:54:42,057
Kind of fork.

534
00:54:45,094 --> 00:54:49,965
They put it in a fire
until it was hot.

535
00:54:53,402 --> 00:54:55,504
Then they touch me with it.

536
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,210
They held my eyes open.

537
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:07,883
They said they'd
burn my eyes out.

538
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:12,955
After that,
I could not see anymore.

539
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,426
I can see
around the edges, yes...

540
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:21,096
but not in middle.

541
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:24,166
There is blur.

542
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:51,759
What do you feel

543
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:54,129
towards the men
who did this to you?

544
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:02,204
I'm tired of talking.

545
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:12,214
[sniffling]

546
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:41,944
You aren't happy
with me here, are you?

547
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:58,826
You only have to say the word,
and I will take you back.

548
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:01,530
Is that what you want?

549
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:09,938
I can't promise to take you
back to your family.

Yes, sir.

559

You must speak with them.

623
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:39,128
Tell them why we're here.

624
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,262
Tell them your story.

625
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:43,132
I want you
to tell them the truth.

626
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:48,603
You really want me to tell them?

627
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:53,675
Well...

628
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:56,745

Let me say what I...

what I want.

What I want from my heart...

633
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,532
is for you to come
to return to the town with me.

634
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:22,670
Of your own choice.

635
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:25,840
I want you to come back with me.

I have... I have brought some...

645
01:10:17,659 --> 01:10:21,696
gifts that I would
like you to have.

646
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:36,879
Ask them if we may buy
one of their horses.

647
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:38,713
Say I will pay in silver.

648
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:54,290
Silver is the... for horse he
does not take away from you.

649
01:11:54,323 --> 01:11:58,360
He does not take away my horse.

650

What have you done with my men?

660
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:29,338
Is there anything
I can help you with?

661
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:37,312
May I speak with Colonel Joll?

662
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,283
Where have you been?

663
01:15:41,316 --> 01:15:43,685
I've been on a journey.

664
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:47,222
It pains me that I was not here
when you arrived

665
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,391
to offer you hospitality.

666
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,161
You've been treasonously
consorting with the enemy.

667
01:15:53,996 --> 01:15:55,030
Do you deny it?

668
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:59,201
We have no enemy
that I know of,

669
01:15:59,234 --> 01:16:01,503
unless we ourselves
are the enemy.

670
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:06,175
Who gave you permission
to leave your post?

671
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:11,013
That is a private matter.

672
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:13,015
You will have to take
my word for it.

673
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:16,251
I do not intend to discuss it.

674
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,620
I would like to speak
with Colonel Joll.

675
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:20,556
Colonel Joll's not here.

676
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:25,060
Colonel Joll is out
conducting operations

677
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:27,729
to correct the situation
that you've allowed to develop.

678
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:29,398
Fine.

since I arrived in this town...

683
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:41,577
so you have some idea

684

[blows landing]

740

[prisoners grunting]

741
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:11,606
- Beat them!
- Come on! Beat the animals!

742
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,841
Beat the animals!

743
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:15,644
[crowd chattering]

744
01:22:15,677 --> 01:22:16,611
Beat him!

745
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:26,088
[crowd murmuring]

746
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:28,657
- [clapping]
- [chattering]

747
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,791
That's the way.

748
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:40,502
[clapping and cheering]

749
01:22:47,143 --> 01:22:48,343
No.

750
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:51,413
No!

751
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:54,382
No! No! No! No!

752
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:58,054
You! You are
depraving these people!

753
01:22:58,087 --> 01:22:59,387
You... [groans]

754
01:23:01,157 --> 01:23:02,657
[groans] No!

755
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:04,726
[wincing]

756
01:23:04,759 --> 01:23:05,928
No! No!

757
01:23:05,962 --> 01:23:06,996
Wait! Wait!

758
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:08,130
You broke...

759
01:23:08,164 --> 01:23:09,531
Wait! Wait. Wait.

760
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:11,833
You've broken my arm.

761
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:16,072
Just wait.

762
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,910
No, not with that,
not with that hammer.

763
01:23:20,943 --> 01:23:22,912
You would not use
a hammer on a beast.

764
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:25,081
Look. These are men!

765
01:23:25,114 --> 01:23:26,448
Men!

766
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:27,449
[groans]

767
01:23:29,886 --> 01:23:30,819
[blow strikes]

768
01:23:31,888 --> 01:23:33,588
[gurgling]

769
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:37,792
[door clangs]

770
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:39,761
[lock clicking]

771
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,666
[panting]

772
01:23:52,008 --> 01:23:53,742
[chuckles]

773
01:23:56,811 --> 01:24:00,582
[girl humming a melody]

774
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:03,685
[metal clinking]

775
01:24:23,272 --> 01:24:24,439
[stops humming]

776
01:24:26,075 --> 01:24:28,044
[Magistrate breathing raggedly]

777
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:54,003
Among the items
found in your apartment

778
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:56,705
was this wooden chest.

779
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:58,640
Its contents are unusual.

780
01:25:00,176 --> 01:25:05,613
It contains approximately
300 slips of white poplar wood.

781
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:08,250
The surfaces are written on

782
01:25:08,284 --> 01:25:10,920
in an unfamiliar script.

783
01:25:10,953 --> 01:25:14,723
Now, a reasonable inference

784
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:17,226
is that these slips
contain messages

785
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:19,962
passed between yourself
and other parties.

786
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:24,100
It remains for you to explain

787
01:25:24,133 --> 01:25:27,869
from whom are the messages,

788
01:25:27,903 --> 01:25:30,805
to whom are the messages.

789
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:32,908
Permit me.

790
01:25:43,152 --> 01:25:47,522
I am sorry
I have to send bad news.

791
01:25:49,892 --> 01:25:54,596
The soldiers came
and took your brother away.

792
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:57,066
I have been to the fort
every day

793
01:25:57,099 --> 01:26:00,036
to plead for his return.

794
01:26:02,338 --> 01:26:06,275
Yesterday, they sent out
a man to speak with me.

795
01:26:06,308 --> 01:26:09,278
He says your brother
is no longer here.

796
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:11,679
He says he has been ta...

797
01:26:13,349 --> 01:26:15,084
he has been taken away.

798
01:26:16,952 --> 01:26:19,055
Do not tell your mother,

799
01:26:19,088 --> 01:26:22,224
but join me in praying for him.

800
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:26,062
Now, let... let's see...

801
01:26:26,095 --> 01:26:29,065
what this one says.

802
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,271
Um, I went to fetch your...

803
01:26:35,304 --> 01:26:38,573
Ah. I went to fetch
your brother.

804
01:26:39,874 --> 01:26:44,180
They showed me into a room
where he lay

805
01:26:44,213 --> 01:26:47,183
sewn up in a sheet.

806
01:26:47,216 --> 01:26:48,984
He...

807
01:26:49,018 --> 01:26:53,655
Th-There were bruises
all over his body,

808
01:26:53,688 --> 01:26:57,625
and his feet were broken
and swollen.

809
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:03,232
"What's happened to him?"
I asked the soldier.

810
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,667
"I don't know," he said.

811
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:23,319
As you see,
it contains a single character.

812
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:25,820
It is the...
It is the character...

813
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:29,091
barbarian character for "war."

814
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:33,162
Although it can also stand
for "vengeance,"

815
01:27:33,195 --> 01:27:38,234
and if... if you turn it
upside down like this,

816
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:39,801
it can mean...

817
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,104
"justice."

818
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:48,010
There's no way of knowing
in what sense it is intended.

819
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:52,214
That is a part
of barbarian c-cunning.

820
01:27:53,781 --> 01:27:56,418
It's the same
with the rest of these.

821
01:27:56,452 --> 01:27:59,821
Slips, they can be read
in many ways.

822
01:27:59,854 --> 01:28:02,424
They can be read
as a plan of war,

823
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:09,031
or they can read as a history
of the last years of the Empire.

824
01:28:09,064 --> 01:28:10,966
There's no knowing.

825
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,101
Thank you.

826
01:28:20,376 --> 01:28:22,144
I'm finished.

827
01:28:24,746 --> 01:28:29,418
You have no idea how tiresome
your behavior is.

828
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:32,054
You are the only official
on the frontier

829
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:35,324
from whom we have not had
the fullest cooperation.

830
01:28:37,059 --> 01:28:38,494
When I arrived back,

831
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:42,965
I had decided that as soon
as I had the answers from you

832
01:28:42,998 --> 01:28:44,967
to a simple few questions...

833
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:49,238
you would be free
to go back to your old life

834
01:28:49,271 --> 01:28:51,773
and your concubines.

835
01:28:54,176 --> 01:28:58,214
However, you seem
to have a new ambition.

836
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:02,484
You want to make
a name for yourself

837
01:29:02,518 --> 01:29:05,154
as the one just man.

838
01:29:05,187 --> 01:29:07,990
You are simply a clown.

839
01:29:08,023 --> 01:29:10,292
You are dirty.

840
01:29:10,326 --> 01:29:12,294
You stink.

841
01:29:12,328 --> 01:29:14,829
They can smell you a mile away.

842
01:29:16,232 --> 01:29:19,101
You want to get your name
into the history books,

843
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:20,336
history.

844
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:23,939
This is the border.

845
01:29:23,973 --> 01:29:26,242
This is nowhere.

846
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:27,842
There is no history here.

847
01:29:30,546 --> 01:29:32,314
People are not interested

848
01:29:32,348 --> 01:29:36,485
in the history
of the back of beyond.

849
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:38,087
We will end these troubles,

850
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,022
we will put down the enemy,

851
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:42,191
and that will be the end of it.

852
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:43,292
The enemy?

853
01:29:45,027 --> 01:29:48,163
These pitiable creatures
of yours,

854
01:29:48,197 --> 01:29:51,500
are they the enemy
that I must fear, Colonel?

855
01:29:51,533 --> 01:29:54,903
No, you... you are
the enemy, Colonel.

856
01:29:54,937 --> 01:29:56,171
Nonsense.

857
01:29:56,205 --> 01:29:58,907
You are an obscene torturer.

858
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:05,281
You... You deserve to be hanged.

859
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:11,920
Now to business.

860
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:16,458
I would like
a statement from you

861
01:30:16,492 --> 01:30:19,395
on everything that passed
between you and the barbarians

862
01:30:19,428 --> 01:30:23,432
on your recent
and unauthorized visit.

863
01:30:29,338 --> 01:30:30,906
We are waiting.

864
01:30:46,221 --> 01:30:48,057
I refuse.

865
01:30:50,926 --> 01:30:52,394
You refuse?

866
01:30:54,997 --> 01:30:56,598
Very well.

867
01:30:56,632 --> 01:30:58,934
Then our interview is over.

868
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:02,438
He is yours.

[gasps]

877
01:32:28,424 --> 01:32:29,358
Pull him up.

[gasping]

879
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:33,929
Climb.

880
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:39,401
Climb.

881
01:32:39,435 --> 01:32:41,370
[gasping]

882
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:51,680
And what do you
want to say to me?

883
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:54,349
That... That nothing passed

884
01:32:54,383 --> 01:32:57,986
between the barbarians
and myself

885
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,489
of a military nature.

886
01:33:00,522 --> 01:33:03,058
It was a private affair.

887
01:33:03,091 --> 01:33:06,228
I returned the girl
to her people...

888
01:33:07,563 --> 01:33:08,697
nothing more.

889
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:12,334

No chance of going in
to my apartments

just for a minute,

894
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:09,391
get a few of my things?

895
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:14,162
Sir, I can't.

896
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:16,231
[chuckles]

897
01:34:16,265 --> 01:34:17,266
I really can't.

898
01:34:17,299 --> 01:34:18,567
It's fine.

899
01:34:21,803 --> 01:34:24,773
Colonel Joll
and his expeditionary force

900
01:34:24,806 --> 01:34:30,245
have been out in the desert
for a long time, haven't they?

901
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:31,647
Since when?

902
01:34:33,315 --> 01:34:34,416
Since August, sir.

903
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:35,717
August?

904
01:34:39,788 --> 01:34:41,623
You must be worried.

[chuckles]

907
01:34:49,598 --> 01:34:54,536
Well, one mustn't take
the barbarians lightly.

908
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,505
[sweeping]

909
01:35:04,646 --> 01:35:06,582
[scraping]

Your... Your daughter's gone,

911

leaving you with the boy?

912
01:35:29,638 --> 01:35:32,307
Ah, he's no trouble.

913
01:35:34,276 --> 01:35:37,746
[sighs]
So many people have left,

914
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:39,615
- all my girls...
- [coins jingle]

915
01:35:39,648 --> 01:35:41,583
your clerk, Naim.

916
01:35:42,618 --> 01:35:45,454
They took the east road.

917
01:35:45,487 --> 01:35:47,689
Just 'til it settles down,
they say.

918
01:35:51,894 --> 01:35:53,128
[chuckles]

919
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,435
My rooms are empty.

920

[chuckles]

921
01:36:02,504 --> 01:36:04,806
But they won't let me in.

922
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:13,215
I'll find room for you.

923
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,622
You're an angel.

924
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:23,191
[chuckles]

925
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,498
You're always somewhere else.

926
01:36:34,003 --> 01:36:36,238
She would say the same thing...

927
01:36:38,306 --> 01:36:40,208
your barbarian girl.

928
01:36:42,811 --> 01:36:44,881
She said you were
always somewhere else.

929
01:36:44,914 --> 01:36:47,349
She couldn't understand you.

930
01:36:47,382 --> 01:36:49,685
She didn't know
what you wanted from her.

931
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:58,460
I didn't know
the two of you were intimate.

932
01:36:58,493 --> 01:37:00,195
Oh, we talked.

933
01:37:01,596 --> 01:37:06,936
Sometimes she used to cry
and cry and cry.

934
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:13,408
What bird
has the heart to sing...

935
01:37:14,643 --> 01:37:16,678
in a thicket of thorns?

936
01:37:18,647 --> 01:37:21,416
Oh, no, it wasn't
what they did to her.

937
01:37:22,651 --> 01:37:23,819
It was you.

938
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:27,890
You made her very unhappy.

939
01:37:33,795 --> 01:37:35,363
Grandma.

940
01:37:36,865 --> 01:37:40,235
I-I did?

941
01:37:44,339 --> 01:37:45,741
Yeah, didn't you know that?

942
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,578
Grandma.

943
01:38:01,924 --> 01:38:03,425
[door opens]

944
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,026
- Ah.
- Yeah.

945
01:38:37,059 --> 01:38:39,028
- Why not?
- That's what I said to him.

946
01:38:43,532 --> 01:38:44,766
- [sighs]
- Your move.

947
01:38:45,834 --> 01:38:46,835
- Drawing.
- Ah.

948
01:38:49,906 --> 01:38:51,007
[chuckles] So...

949
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:54,409
Magistrate.

950
01:38:57,379 --> 01:38:59,681
You're growing fat again.

951
01:39:01,683 --> 01:39:03,552
What happened to your work?

952
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:11,626
I am a prisoner awaiting trial.

953
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:16,065
Prisoners awaiting trial

954
01:39:16,098 --> 01:39:18,968
are not required
to work for their feed.

955
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:23,772
That is the law.

956
01:39:24,806 --> 01:39:27,109
We have no record of you.

957
01:39:27,143 --> 01:39:28,510
H-How could you be a prisoner?

958
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:30,046
Do we have a record of this man?

959
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:31,914
No, sir, we don't.

960
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:35,417
Then you must be a free man.

961
01:39:36,618 --> 01:39:37,920
The gates are open.

962
01:39:39,088 --> 01:39:40,856
Go on. Leave if you wish.

963
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:48,030
Just... Just a minute.

964
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:56,005
There's something that I would
like to know before I leave.

965
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,509
Forgive me if the question
seems impudent.

966
01:40:02,744 --> 01:40:04,546
But I would like to ask...

967
01:40:08,117 --> 01:40:10,920
how do you eat afterwards?

968
01:40:13,122 --> 01:40:14,556
After you've been...

969
01:40:16,758 --> 01:40:18,860
working with people?

970
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:27,003
[laughing]

971
01:40:30,505 --> 01:40:31,773
I'm sincere.

972
01:40:34,043 --> 01:40:36,078
- [sighs]
- Do you...

973
01:40:36,112 --> 01:40:40,548
Do you find it easy
to take food afterwards?

974
01:40:40,582 --> 01:40:44,053
I would imagine
one wants to wash one's hands,

975
01:40:44,086 --> 01:40:45,854
to... to clean off the blood,

976
01:40:45,888 --> 01:40:48,190
but to sit with one's
family and friends,

977
01:40:48,224 --> 01:40:49,491
eat...

978
01:40:49,524 --> 01:40:51,127
Get out of here.

979
01:40:52,794 --> 01:40:55,064
Get out of here,
you fucking old lunatic.

980
01:40:55,097 --> 01:40:56,531
Get out!

981
01:40:57,967 --> 01:41:01,103
Go and die somewhere,
you fucking traitor.

982
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:04,941
[horn blowing]

983
01:41:10,246 --> 01:41:12,181
[crowd murmuring]

984
01:41:44,981 --> 01:41:47,049
- [flies buzzing]
- [crowd gasping]

985
01:41:50,219 --> 01:41:52,154
[crowd murmuring]

986
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,829
[flies buzzing]

987
01:42:08,037 --> 01:42:12,241
"This withdrawal will be
only a temporary measure.

988
01:42:13,943 --> 01:42:16,745
Caretaker force will remain

989
01:42:16,778 --> 01:42:19,882
which will be adequate
for all routine duties.

990
01:42:22,018 --> 01:42:24,853
Relevant orders are given
on imperial authority

991
01:42:24,887 --> 01:42:28,290
and are part of a general
scaling down of operations

992
01:42:28,324 --> 01:42:31,526
along the frontier
for the duration of the winter."

993
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:35,064
Thank you all...

994
01:42:36,698 --> 01:42:39,801
for your unforgettable
hospitality.

995
01:43:10,066 --> 01:43:12,034
- [gunfire]
- [screaming]

996
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:19,909
Okay, let's go!

997
01:43:19,942 --> 01:43:21,676
That's the last of the grain!

998
01:43:21,709 --> 01:43:22,677
[gunshot]

999
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:25,680
[bleating]

1000
01:43:27,183 --> 01:43:29,051
Bring her! Come on!

1001
01:43:29,085 --> 01:43:30,652
This way!

1002
01:43:30,685 --> 01:43:32,121
- Get back!
- Get in here.

1003
01:43:32,154 --> 01:43:35,224
- Get back, or I'll shoot!
- [horse neighs]

1004
01:43:35,257 --> 01:43:36,325
Hah! Hah!

1005
01:43:37,393 --> 01:43:39,328
[bleating]

1006
01:43:41,696 --> 01:43:43,099

[running footsteps]

1011
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:46,295
Where is Officer Mandel?

1012
01:44:47,363 --> 01:44:49,198
We must have fresh horses.

1013
01:44:49,231 --> 01:44:50,966
Who needs horses?

1014
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,269
The Colonel.
We... We need fresh horses.

1015
01:44:54,802 --> 01:44:56,738
Is he here?

1016
01:44:56,771 --> 01:44:58,908
We need fresh horses.

1017
01:45:00,742 --> 01:45:03,179
There are no horses.

1018
01:45:03,212 --> 01:45:04,846
There's nothing.

1019
01:45:07,016 --> 01:45:08,450
Oh.

1020
01:45:08,484 --> 01:45:10,386
- Ch-Check that way.
- Okay.

1021
01:45:12,888 --> 01:45:14,856

1022
01:45:50,492 --> 01:45:52,428

01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:05,207
We need to hurry, sir!

1025

[rocks thumping]
