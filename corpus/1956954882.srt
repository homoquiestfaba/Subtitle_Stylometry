'You know,

00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,884
'last night...

3
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,679
'I had this incredible pain.

4
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,024
'The pain was so strong that I took...

5
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,861
'every pill in the goddamn house.

6
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,491
'But... the pills wouldn't do anything.

7
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,494
'The pain wouldn't go away.

8
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,082
'I... I tried to find an image,

9
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,958
'one worthwhile image...

10
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,961
'that would get me through it.

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,965
'And all I could find was shit.

12
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:37,973
'I couldn't find one worthwhile
goddamn thing.'

13
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,448
'9-1-1 emergency.'

14
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,618
'Well, this is regarding
disturbances on our street.

15
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,080
'I don't know, we've had noise...'

16
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,542
No...

00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,990
'How much of that coke did you do?

18
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,658
'Huh? How much? Talk to me.

19
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,869
'727. Roll paramedics.'

00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,239
'...this morning.

00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,784
'Very combative.
Rule out drug overdose.

'We found cocaine, alcohol, barbiturates,
everything but a needle on scene.'

'He's not moving air.

00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,339
'Take it easy, buddy. Take it easy.
What's your name?'

25
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,070
'Good morning, Media Talent Agency.
How can I help you?'

26
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,532
Yes, may I speak to someone
in Ivan Beckman's office, please?

27
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,743
'Hi!
You've reached the office of Ivan Beckman.

28
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,329
'If you'd like to skip this message,
press pound.

29
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,498
'If you'd like to leave a message
for Ivan Beckman

30
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,375
'or his assistant Lucy Lawrence,
leave a message after the tone.'

31
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,462
Yes, hello,
this is Rosemary Kramer calling.

32
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,964
I'm calling about Ivan Beckman.

33
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,734
Hey! You'd better hurry it up.
Come on.

34
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,778
Guys, wait!

35
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:51,949
Hi!

36
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,121
Ivan Beckman's office.

37
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,456
OK.

38
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,464
'Yeah, look,
this is Lloyd Hall calling.

39
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,717
'I've called several times.
Nobody's called me back.

40
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,804
'Tell Ivan to call me.
Tell him to call me right now.'

41
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,850
Why did he...
Why did he deny it in the first place?

42
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,812
Well, my guess is
that his wife didn't know.

43
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,864
- What's up?
- Hey.

44
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,742
Um, Naomi,
Ivan is totally fucking up.

45
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,595
I think Lloyd's gonna dump him.
Look at this.

46
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,037
Oh, my God,
he called eight times.

47
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,498
Eight times, and I can't get hold of Ivan
to call him back.

48
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,418
'...Rosemary Kramer calling.'

49
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,752
- Wait.
- What?

50
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,338
- 'I have a message...'
- Is it Lloyd again?

51
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,466
Luce, what's wrong?

52
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,890
- You got a buck slip?
- Yes.

53
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,244
I wouldn't go in there today.
I had to get Mary out. I got yelled at.

54
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,519
This is an emergency.

55
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,895
Alright.

56
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:12,863
What do you want?

57
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,675
- This better be fucking important.
- We ought to have at least a consensus.

58
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,284
That's what I'm saying!

59
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,077
Our first choice...

60
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,038
My facts are not on the list.

61
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,957
Is that consensus from everybody?
Everybody buy into that?

62
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,792
Judy?

63
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,839
What's wrong, boss?

64
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,261
This says Ivan died this morning.

65
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,055
What?

66
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,807
Judy... Judy, let me go call
and check it out.

67
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,771
- So, what's it say?
- Says he was in the hospital.

68
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,315
I saw him the other day.
He wasn't in the hospital.

69
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,818
How did he die?

70
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,111
What, OD...?

71
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,404
- What?
- What?

72
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,157
Well, he was doing a lot of drugs.

73
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,950
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

74
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,079
- Wait a minute, let's not speculate!
- He wrecked his Jag one week ago

75
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,498
and drove it in
with a huge gash in the side.

76
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,043
Listen! Listen, everybody!

77
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,670
Has anybody seen him lately?

78
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,799
- I saw him doing drugs at a party.
- I saw him last week.

79
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,724
Joe, I don't want to hear
any more about that.

80
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,011
Let's wait and see. Let's wait and see.

81
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,638
- Barry.
- OK.

82
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,684
I spoke to Cedars. The body is there.

83
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,102
- The body?
- Oh, my God!

84
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,854
Nobody had any idea, not his parents...

85
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,731
Not his dad, not his friends.

86
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,900
- What happened?
- How did he die?

87
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,610
They said that he died of cancer.

88
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,735
Cancer?

89
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,548
Well, I mean, that's what they said.
Who knows, it could've been anything.

90
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,217
What do you mean, "anything"?
What do you mean?

91
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,493
Well, I mean, it could've been drugs,
I don't know.

92
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,222
I think that if he were sick,
some people here would've probably known.

93
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,248
Let's have a moment of silence.

94
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,526
Now, listen, here's the other thing.
I looked at his phone sheet.

95
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,301
He hasn't returned a phone call for days.

96
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,863
It could be we'll have a major problem
with a number of our clients.

97
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,056
- Who?
- Don West for one.

98
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,101
Then we start damage control right now.

99
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,896
I saw Don West having lunch
with some UTA agents yesterday.

100
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,440
OK, who's gonna talk...?

101
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,317
- I'll talk to Don.
- You're dealing with the family.

102
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,570
I know Don.
I'll talk to Don, it's easier.

103
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,796
Hey, Brad.

104
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,983
- Hey. Hey, Barry. How are you?
- Good to see you, man.

105
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,633
Good to see you.
Come in, come in.

106
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,052
Let me get rid of Brutus here.

107
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,804
Get down there.

108
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,598
Shut that door.

109
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,477
So, uh...

110
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,145
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

111
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,897
Heavy about Ivan.

112
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,315
Yeah, I know, it's too bad.

113
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,151
- Quite the clam-opener here.
- Oh, well, you know...

114
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,445
Don, you know, lives the life here.

115
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,239
So, uh... I hear it was drugs.

116
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,618
No, actually, he...
It was cancer, he died of lung cancer.

117
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,828
That's not what Don thinks.

118
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,163
Yeah, it's unfortunate,

119
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,433
- but he died of lung cancer.
- I mean, you know, all that blow...

120
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,710
I mean, I always wondered
where he got all that energy from.

121
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,063
Well, Brad, you know,
Ivan was a good friend of all of ours.

122
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,131
He was a very, very close friend
to a lot of people,

123
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,068
and he died a tragic death, I don't
think there's anything funny about it.

124
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,219
Oh, alright.

125
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,655
- So, can I get you something?
- No, it's OK. I'll just wait.

126
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,722
- OK.
- Yeah, thanks.

127
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,950
- Don will be right down in five minutes.
- Great, thanks.

128
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,100
OK.

129
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,050
Stick 'em up,
or I'll blow your head off.

130
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,972
...not the Dodgers...

131
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,390
Marco, wipe your feet.

132
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,850
And shut the door!

133
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,852
I left my car keys in the car.

134
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,272
Yolanda, I thought we handled
this direct marketing stuff.

135
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,607
I thought you told them... Yolanda!

136
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,443
Who is that?

137
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,571
I'm going to get the gun!

138
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,035
I'm going to get the big gun!

139
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,371
Hey, Don.
How are you doing, man?

140
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,789
How are you? Good to see you.

141
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,083
- I've had better days.
- I know, it's, uh...

142
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,208
- It's a tragedy.
- Sad.

143
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,373
Really, it's just terrible.

144
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,297
- He's dead.
- Don! I know, it's terrible.

145
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,007
What'd he do?
Freebase his face off?

146
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,510
Imagine, Ivan running down the street,
his head on fire,

147
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,905
- script in his hand, one he hadn't even read.
- "Help me, help me."

148
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,848
Nobody'd even piss on an agent
to save him.

149
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,057
Thanks.

150
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,852
- No offence, Fernando.
- I'm sure, none taken.

151
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,606
He died of a massive lung tumor.
He had cancer.

152
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,399
So that's the cover story, cancer?

153
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,151
He had cancer.

154
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,156
Alright, I've known you a long time.
You know, that's what they say.

155
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,327
He was a drug addict and a pussy freak,
and you're telling me he died of cancer?

156
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,014
You know what? He was a friend,
he was a good guy, that's the line.

157
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,664
What can I tell you? I have no idea.

158
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,416
Who's that over there?

159
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,793
Who's that running down the stairs?

160
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,545
- Johnny!
- Don...

161
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,548
Bradsky, I'm overrun by children here.
Handle this.

162
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,485
I wanna tell you something else.
I don't want Danny McTeague on the movie.

163
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,113
I know he wrote it, he's a good kid,
but I don't want him directing the movie.

164
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,782
You know, I think Danny did
a really, really good job with the script.

165
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,166
That's his problem. He's a writer.

166
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,102
We need some objectivity.
I want Constanza Vero to do it.

167
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,897
I want Constanza Vero to do it.

168
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,791
Constanza's a really, really good director,
I like her.

169
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,317
She knows her way around a camera.

170
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,602
I wanna tell you something
about my problem with Danny.

171
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,697
Hang on a second, hang on a second.
I wanna tell you my problem with Danny.

172
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,285
I kinda had it with these young punks
coming out of UCLA film school.

173
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,638
- Understand me?
- Let me ask you this...

174
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,432
- I'm not doing a sitcom here, baby!
- That's why I'm here. Let me ask you...

175
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,501
I'm gonna lock, load,
stand up and shoot and move on.

176
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,420
All I need to hear from a director is
"yes", "no", and "move it".

177
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,922
I completely understand.

178
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,883
Constanza Vero knows her way
around a camera. Listen to me!

179
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,027
Will you commit to making it?

180
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,637
What am I, farting the
"Star-Spangled Banner" here, Fernando?

181
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,763
It's Barry.

182
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,265
I said I want to make the movie
with Constanza Vero.

183
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,600
Let me tell you why.

184
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,936
She knows her way around a camera,
and she's gay,

185
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,289
- and I got a problem on that front right now.
- I've read about all that.

186
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,482
That's right! You ought to see
what I've been reading.

187
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,276
You ought to check out the mail
I've been getting about my family.

188
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,028
It just doesn't end...

189
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,155
- See this? Let me show you something.
- OK.

190
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,466
I'm gonna show you something,
Fernando.

191
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,075
Bradsky, share the facts
with Fernando,

192
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,245
just a couple of the samples of the shit
we've been getting at the office,

193
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,570
the stuff coming to the house.

194
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,416
I tell you something, Fernando,
anybody comes into this house...

195
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,251
Brad, we're gonna show him the goods.

196
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,671
Yolanda! Keep the kids
out of the bedroom, Yolanda!

197
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:45,880
Yolanda!

198
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,717
Bradsky, pull out the goods.
Show him the goods.

199
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,653
Well, I tell you this, you know,
I got no problem at all.

200
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,429
All I say is, in my opinion, you know,

201
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,532
an asshole's for shitting,
an asshole's an exit wound.

202
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,659
- I've always felt the same.
- You follow me, Fernando?

203
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,060
I tell you something,
anybody comes through this house, man,

204
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,062
any kind of riot happens around me,

205
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,582
they're gonna get to party,
they're gonna get a very warm welcome.

206
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,750
I don't think anyone's coming round here.

207
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,334
It ain't gonna be Rome with Nero fiddling,
you hear me, Fernando?

208
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,321
Barry! It's Barry.

209
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,411
Let me just say something.
I want Constanza Vero directing this movie.

210
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,512
So, Brad, thank you so much
for your help.

211
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,560
I really, really appreciate it.
It was good seeing you again.

212
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,418
And, you know what?

213
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,229
If you could do anything
to put in a good word for us,

214
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,690
we're going to kick ass for the guy,
and we really want to be working with him.

215
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,383
- Well, I'm with you guys on this one.
- I know you are.

216
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,268
So, anything to help,
I really appreciate it.

217
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,155
- Good seeing you.
- You know, these movie stars...

218
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,765
I know, but no one's gonna do
a better job.

219
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,433
- OK.
- OK, thanks a lot.

220
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,851
- See you.
- Good seeing you.

221
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,507
- Hello. Who's this?
- 'It's Danny.'

222
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,111
The guy that's been trying
to call you all day, yes.

223
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,423
Yeah, I know you're on your cell phone.

224
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,865
Listen...

225
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,634
Yeah, I know.
I heard about Ivan. It's terrible.

226
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,411
I feel really terrible about that.
Really... yeah.

227
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:03,458
Uh... look, Lloyd is firing me
from "Weeds" from what I understand.

228
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,584
Is that what's happening?

229
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,629
I'm being fired?
I've never been fired in my life.

230
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,673
It's my script.
How can I be fired from my own script?

231
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,568
You're my agent.
I'd hoped you would take care...

232
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,177
You hear what I said?

233
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,863
- Did you hear me?
- 'Yes, I can hear you.'

234
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:16,887
Hello?

235
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,931
'Hello?'

236
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,696
- Danny are you there?
- 'Yeah, I'm here.'

237
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,976
Barry? Barry!

238
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,311
Goddammit!

239
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,230
Get him on the phone, please.
Please!

240
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,732
Barry! My agent! Thank you. Yes.

241
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,276
Man is like a breath.

242
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,113
His days are as a fleeting shadow.

243
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,282
In the morning, he flourishes
and grows up like grass.

244
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,244
In the evening,
he is cut down and withers.

245
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,831
So teach us to number our days,

246
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,375
that we may get us a heart of wisdom.

247
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,754
Mark the men of integrity
and behold the upright,

248
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,173
for there is a future
for the men of peace.

249
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,139
And who is better to give
the sad words of parting

250
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,016
than the beloved sister of our departed?

251
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,104
Marcia Beckman.

252
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,189
Marcia, please come forward.

253
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,281
Thank you for coming.

254
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,075
It really means a lot to me and my family.

255
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,202
And it would've meant the world to Ivan

256
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,955
to see how loved he really was.

257
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,642
It doesn't look good.
He's more than fashionably late.

258
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,376
I know, but you know...

259
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,545
He said he'd be here.

260
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,088
You see Charlotte?

261
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,275
Yeah, she looks pretty good
for someone who's grieving.

262
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,217
She's got some nice titties on her.

263
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,594
You're so vulgar.

264
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,096
He was destined for greatness.

265
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,433
He was a good friend,
a great family member.

266
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,393
He was always there for me.

267
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,971
I remember when I was little.

268
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,355
Fuck!

269
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,107
Danny doesn't look very happy.

270
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,109
Danny's not gonna be very happy.

271
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,753
- Just pretend.
- What happened?

272
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,487
Maybe he won't see us.

273
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,742
He was amazing, he was so nice.

274
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,160
Barry! Enjoying the funeral?

275
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,039
Shut the fuck up!
This is not the time.

276
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,058
- I know what you did, Barry.
- It's not a good time.

277
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,082
You sold me out.

278
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,711
- Danny, I'm fucking helping your script.
- Helping my script?

279
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,316
Thanks for the help, I appreciate it!

280
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,007
Shut the fuck up at the funeral.

281
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,681
I think Don's come in.

282
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,934
...so many ways
I wanted to say goodbye,

283
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,727
and now I don't get to.

284
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:32,440
And I know it's never easy
when we lose people in our lives,

285
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,901
but I'm going to have to make do.

286
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,861
I suppose we all are.

287
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,947
We didn't really get
to say goodbye to Ivan.

288
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,576
- I think he genuinely, truly will be missed.
- Thank you for coming.

289
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,662
Don West!

290
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,497
Oh, God, what's he doing?

291
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,875
- Don West, the big actor, big shot.
- Shh!

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,170
- Big time actor!
- Shut the fuck up!

293
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,297
- Leave!
- Barry, keep your mouth shut, pal.

294
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,901
- That is between me and him.
- Danny, this is a funeral.

295
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,677
Fuck the funeral, pal!

296
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,846
- I swear to God...
- Get up!

297
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,824
- Danny come on, let's go.
- Get the fuck out of here.

298
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,434
You can't do my movie...
take my movie...!

299
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,576
Amen!

300
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,661
Ivan Beckman's office.

301
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,998
He... He just...

302
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,459
OK. Wait a minute,
let me see if I can put you through.

303
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,254
Ivan?

304
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,006
Hi, it's Lucy.

305
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,716
Danny McTeague.

306
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,052
Danny boy, how are you?

307
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,554
Good! Good, good, good!

308
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,974
Danny boy, the pipes are calling
from studio to studio.

309
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,770
I can see your name in lights right now.

310
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,356
"Weeds" is a fantastic project.

311
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,483
Yeah, I like it, too.
Well, I mean, I wrote it.

312
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,902
Your blood pressure's normal.

313
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,322
'Danny boy,
I think your script is deeply profound,

314
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,240
'and I think you should be making it

315
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:49,452
'instead of making a lousy
goddamn motherfucking sequel.'

316
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,411
Uh-huh?

317
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,580
- Hold on a second.
- You lost a couple of pounds.

318
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,833
- Yeah. I've been working out.
- Good.

319
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,586
- Look good?
- You're still too skinny for me. Come on.

320
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,922
But listen, um...

321
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,983
Can you do me a favor?
Can we keep this between ourselves?

322
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,110
I don't want Bonnie knowing
that we're talking like this,

323
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,719
so, you know,
if we say it's just...

324
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,305
Don't worry about Bonnie.

325
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,141
No, let's not mention anything to her,
that's all, OK?

326
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,643
We'll keep this between you and I,

327
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,871
- and we'll take care of her.
- I said, "Get off the phone." Say goodbye.

328
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,022
Alright, Danny boy, I gotta go.

329
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,440
OK, big, big kiss.

330
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,151
I'm really excited for you, Danny,
I really am.

331
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,987
- Hang up the phone, Ivan.
- OK, bye-bye.

332
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,113
- Give it here.
- Lucy?

333
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,076
- Put my calls on hold for a while, OK?
- Hang up the phone. Hang up!

334
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,536
- Give it here.
- Jesus.

335
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,746
Give it here.

336
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,623
I'm not playing with you, Ivan.

337
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,000
- Why are you so...?
- Four, three...

338
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,919
I'm gonna knock you over.

339
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,337
Here.

340
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,549
- Yeah!
- Yeah, your temperature is normal. Fine.

341
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,110
Come on, let's get your chest X-ray.

342
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,218
X-ray? What X-ray?

343
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,946
You have to have a chest X-ray
for the insurance.

344
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,096
I gotta go, Jackie.

345
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,223
Come on, you have a chest X-ray.
It's on the form.

346
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,182
Why?

347
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,910
Because the insurance company
asks for it.

348
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,254
Have you ever smoked a cigarette?

349
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,956
- I've smoked, but I don't smoke.
- Then you're gonna have a chest X-ray.

350
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,481
Let's go.

351
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,366
♪ Lovely, sweet and warm... ♪

352
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,368
And we're in.

353
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,257
Let's see the dick.

354
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,925
Well, well, well.

355
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,760
Good God!

356
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:32,722
Uh-huh-huh!

357
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,521
Good evening, ladies...

358
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,525
Hi!

359
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,070
I'm very excited.
Nervous, but excited.

360
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,158
I don't understand
this Lolita Complex in LA.

361
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,678
I don't want to kiss a moustache
or go down on something bald.

362
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,245
I want a bush.

363
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,080
My wife Bea,

364
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,583
a beautiful Italian woman,
has a bush.

365
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,126
I like to go down on a bush.

366
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,337
You like the...
You like the tropical flavor.

367
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,088
Where is she anyway?

368
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,300
Yolanda? Yolanda hasn't been
to a premiere with me in ten years.

369
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,678
Wisely, she stays at home
and stays out of this bullshit.

370
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,013
She doesn't care.

371
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:17,892
She stays with the kids and leaves me
out with the boys... and a girl.

372
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,854
- And she trusts you? Amazing.
- She does, because Bradsky's with me.

373
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,815
Have you ever been unfaithful
to your wife, Don?

374
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,528
To Yolanda? No, never.

375
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,488
That's not what I've heard.

376
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,893
Not compared to the opportunity.

377
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,158
I heard that you heard in a beauty parlor
I was kinky.

378
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,869
- That's exactly what I heard.
- Well, let me ask you something.

379
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,747
Does snorting cocaine
two millimeters from your pussy

380
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,415
make me kinky?

381
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,792
I don't consider that kinky.

382
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,213
Gorgeous.

383
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,632
Absolutely lovely.

384
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,053
I don't want to get this on your dress.

385
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,138
OK, we'll just try to avoid it.

386
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,186
Uh, that's coffee.

387
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,563
Alright.

388
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,399
Brad, put your eyes back in your face.

389
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,375
Yes, indeed.

390
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,295
Good to see you again.

391
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,855
- How have you been?
- I'm doing great.

392
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:29,714
Have you seen it?

393
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,275
- Yeah, it's a great movie.
- Thank you very much.

394
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,360
You seem unstoppable in this movie.
It's a really good movie.

395
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,224
I appreciate it.
It think it's for these times.

396
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,599
I don't care if you're blowing him,

397
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,852
but what the fuck are you doing
in the back of his limo?

398
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,146
I'm just paid to say the words,
my brother.

399
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,064
Have a good night, sir. Thank you.

400
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,657
- Oh, my God!
- So, that's my agent.

401
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,243
Oh, my God, look at that!
I can't believe he's doing it.

402
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,954
Man, he acts like he hasn't been
greased up in a week.

403
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,458
For God's sakes, not in public.
Can you imagine those two humping?

404
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,836
That motherfucker is trying
to steal my fucking client here

405
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,339
- at the evening of my premiere.
- Let's go get you a drink.

406
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,507
Oh, don't forget
I take it up the ass all the time.

407
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,926
Yes, I know, but you don't like it.

408
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,803
Well, no, I don't know about that.

409
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,805
- What?
- Oh!

410
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,645
It's going to be great.

411
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,369
I could feel you standing there,
looking at the back of my head,

412
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,162
seeing inside.

413
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,792
You seem so quiet.

414
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,088
What's the matter?

415
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,132
You're a murderer, Madeleine.

416
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,594
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,806
It's all my fault.

418
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,200
- You were wonderful in the film.
- You really mean that?

419
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,828
- Of course I do.
- Thanks.

420
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,889
- Can I meet with you next week?
- Of course you can.

421
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,331
OK.

422
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,874
I'll call you.

423
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:29,999
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

424
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,293
Take care.

425
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,170
Goodbye, gentlemen. Bye-bye.

426
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,723
- Hey, Ivan.
- How are you?

427
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,350
What the fuck
you been up to over there?

428
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,602
- Reeling in fish.
- Hey, Margaret.

429
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,062
You haven't met Margaret.

430
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,856
Hello, Margaret.

431
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,149
You haven't met Ivan.

432
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,483
Hello.

433
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,610
- Hi.
- Margaret and Joe.

434
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:57,903
Ivan, how are you?

435
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,488
- Not bad.
- And Geoff!

436
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,658
- Ivan, you making us money?
- Believe me, I'm trying.

437
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,952
- Bye-bye. Good night.
- Good night, Ivan.

438
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:11,834
Ivan!

439
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,044
- Well, Lloyd!
- What, are you avoiding me?

440
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,464
Of course not!
My God, it's so good to see you.

441
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,816
What did you think of the picture?

442
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,526
I thought it was wonderful.
I thought it was great.

443
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,944
- You thought it was wonderful?
- Yeah.

444
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,470
- Really?
- Yeah.

445
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,781
- I thought it sucked.
- You should be proud of it anyway.

446
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:25,848
- I'm not.
- But...

447
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,743
I'm the producer of the movie,
I'm not proud of it.

448
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,395
You know, there's this wonderful director
called Danny McTeague.

449
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:35,274
- Who's that?
- Um, he directed "Angelic Convulsions".

450
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,610
- Never heard of him.
- He got nominated.

451
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,379
- Do you remember he got nominated?
- Yeah, I do.

452
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,280
- Both for writer and director.
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,740
And he's just...

454
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:46,535
He's written a screenplay of late
called "Weeds".

455
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,996
- "Weeds"?
- Yeah, it's a little dark, a little edgy.

456
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,416
- That might be good for Don, a little edgy.
- Perhaps. Perhaps.

457
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,919
Why don't you, uh...
Why don't you give us the script?

458
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,086
For us to look at it.

459
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,714
Yeah... I can't.
I can't send you the script.

460
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,839
Why?

461
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:03,385
Well, his agent is Bonnie,
and I don't want to step on her toes.

462
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:06,889
Oh, you can step on her toes.
Why don't you send me the script?

463
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,433
- Lloyd, ask her to get it to you.
- OK.

464
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,519
- It'd be better.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

465
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,187
Bye, Lloyd. Take care.

466
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,522
Bonnie!

467
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,900
Ah!

468
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,197
- Now, are you gonna thank me?
- Whatever for?

469
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,241
I believe Don wants to do "Weeds".

470
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,700
- Ivan...
- Speak to Lloyd.

471
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,412
- He's a pig.
- No, no, no, he's perfect.

472
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,374
Darling...
Darling, trust me on this.

473
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,835
- What are you talking about?
- OK. OK.

474
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,128
- Do me a favor.
- I'll be right back.

475
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,383
Jesus Christ! I don't understand!

476
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,402
- Don't worry about it.
- I've been with her for a long time.

477
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,029
- Don't worry about it.
- She's a dead weight.

478
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,471
Don't worry about it.

479
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,850
The important thing is that
Don wants to do "Weeds".

480
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,203
- Doesn't he think it's too dark?
- Are you ready to meet him?

481
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,228
- What, now?
- Now.

482
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,563
Do I have to pitch?

483
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,274
I'm not gonna be...
I'm a social...

484
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,109
You can do it, Danny boy,
you can do it.

485
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,111
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Alright, alright.

486
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,113
You'll be brilliant.

487
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,865
Ready?

488
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,449
Come on.

489
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,619
Are you sure he read it?
I mean, did he tell you that he liked it?

490
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,461
<i>Che bello, bello, bello!</i>

491
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,006
<i>Che bello sei tu!</i>

492
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,924
- Can I introduce you...
- What?

493
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,217
...to Danny McTeague?

494
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,888
Danny McTeague?
Not <i>the</i> Danny McTeague?

495
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,015
I gotta say I'm a really big fan of yours.

496
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,808
Unzip and show us.

497
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,060
Not that big!

498
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,812
What's the first rule?

499
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,105
First rule of what?

500
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,732
What's the first rule?

501
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,318
No bloody poofters!

502
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,945
I know this!
Ask me the second rule.

503
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,447
What's the second rule?

504
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,950
- Um... no poofters!
- No bloody poofters!

505
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,470
- What's the third rule?
- The third rule is, "There's no third rule."

506
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,495
Sit down.

507
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:56,540
Ah! Well done! Have a seat.

508
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,169
Now, he's written a beautiful screenplay
called "Weeds",

509
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,379
and I suggest you guys
have a little chat about it.

510
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,714
<i>Ciao,</i> Ivan.

511
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,591
- Don't get into any trouble.
- Bye, Ivan.

512
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,301
Ivan!

513
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,387
Charlotte?

514
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,972
- Problems?
- No.

515
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,891
Danny.

516
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,684
It's this script. It's terrible.

517
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,854
I mean, listen to this.
Listen to this, though.

518
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,320
I mean, I can write
ten times better than this.

519
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,192
I don't know why you're pushing this.

520
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,819
"Her innocence making her fearless,

521
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,322
"she simply bends
and retrieves the ball.

522
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,866
"The man:

523
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,451
"'Get out, I said!'

524
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,370
"She doesn't budge.

525
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,498
"Her eyes scanning up
his tattered clothes

526
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,124
"and muscular form,

527
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,460
"to settle on the single slit
in the sack

528
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,754
"which frames his one eye,

529
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,632
"scared, angered, and tear-filled."

530
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,968
It's pretty bad.

531
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,761
Pretty bad.

532
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,889
Oh, that's terrible.

533
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,641
This is some terrible writing.

534
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,268
What the fuck is this crap?

535
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,690
Ivan, why are you pushing this?
I don't understand.

536
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,316
Tell me what you don't like.

537
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,902
Have you even read this?

538
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,529
You go first.

539
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,155
You've not read it, have you?

540
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,200
You don't have a clue.

541
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,869
What is the script about, Ivan?

542
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,515
- Well, it's about this little weed...
- You're so full of shit!

543
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,000
...that scrambles up this vine,
a deadly weed.

544
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,722
A little bit like
"Jack And The Beanstalk".

545
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:27,131
I mean, I can write something
ten times better than that, you know?

546
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,093
It just pisses me off.

547
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,057
I mean, seriously.

548
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,527
Please don't worry, darling.

549
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,575
It just makes me mad
that you're pushing that piece of shit.

550
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,120
Look, if it's not on the page,
it'll be on the screen.

551
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,207
Danny McTeague knows
how to make a lot of money.

552
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,627
Please believe me.

553
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,357
You know,
just because I'm young and pretty,

554
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,508
it doesn't mean I'm a stupid bimbo.

555
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,302
Whoever said that?

556
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:18,515
You know what? I have to go
and print out a script for Don.

557
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,320
I mean, I pitched him
at the table tonight.

558
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,728
He's seriously interested
in "Me, Myself And I".

559
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,689
- Oh, I'm sure he is.
- He is! I tell you.

560
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,483
I'm sure he is.

561
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,821
Oh, please stay, darling.

562
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,782
No, I have a lot of work to do.

563
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,460
Oh, sweetheart...

564
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,045
Come on, baby.

565
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,255
Please stay.

566
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,174
I'm just not in a sexy mood tonight.

567
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,178
What is it? Is it Don?
Are you thinking about Don?

568
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,347
Jesus Christ, Ivan!

569
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,432
You're so fucking paranoid.

570
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,619
If I was thinking about Don,
I'd stay here and fuck you

571
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,763
and think about Don while I'm fucking you,
how's that?

572
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,565
I'm not even mad,
I just have a lot of work to do.

573
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,473
I mean, it's just overwhelming.

574
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,736
I have so much to do.
You understand.

575
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,740
You don't believe me, I know.

576
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,171
Bye, sweet thing.

577
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,775
Hey, Mr. Dog.

578
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,528
How you doing?

579
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,475
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Ivan.

580
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,728
Hi, Lucy.

581
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,439
- Let's go. Bring the trades, you got 'em?
- Yeah.

582
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,275
You're really burning up the wires.

583
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,776
So, who's been fired today?

584
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,113
- Ivan, everyone's pissed at you.
- Where are the trades?

585
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,329
- Have "Verité" called you?
- No.

586
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,706
- Lloyd Hall is on three.
- Yeah.

587
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,292
'Yeah, I'm calling you
about that script you sent us.'

588
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,586
Fucking unbelievably bad coverage.

589
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,962
I've had great coverage here.

590
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:57,216
And, I mean, I've got good coverage
at a couple of studios as well, goddammit.

591
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,381
Send me the good coverage.

592
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,760
Danny McTeague's on two.

593
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,430
- Yeah.
- Ivan! Let me tell you something.

594
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,098
OK? Let me explain something to you.

595
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,061
D'you hear that?
That's what I think of Don West.

596
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,605
Yeah, he's a jerk.
He's a fucking jerk. I don't want him.

597
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,358
Don West will get your picture green-lit.

598
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:17,569
I don't care. I can get
Larry Barton to do it for free.

599
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,156
That's just about what he's worth.
One big fucking fat zero!

600
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,367
Just break the deal with Don West.

601
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,245
I'm sure it's not that hard.
The guy's impossible to close anyway.

602
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,455
Tell him that that lesbian...

603
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,082
- What's her name?
- Constanza.

604
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,709
Constanza whatever...
the Italian thing.

605
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,062
Tell him that she's gonna do the movie,

606
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,646
and he's such a homophobe, he'll freak out.
He won't wanna do it.

607
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:37,923
Constanza Vero?

608
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,675
'Constanza Vero!'

609
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,385
Huh!

610
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,470
- You know what, Danny?
- 'What's that?'

611
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,915
- You're brilliant.
- 'Thank you.'

612
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,223
Ivan, they all hate it.

613
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,600
Mm.

614
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,662
You've written covers before, haven't you?

615
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,813
Yeah, but I haven't read "Weeds".

616
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:56,316
I know you haven't, but all you have to do
is say that you think it's good,

617
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,735
that Danny McTeague's directing it...
OK?

618
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,463
...and that you recommend it
for any A-list client.

619
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,572
- Whatever you say.
- OK.

620
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,533
I will have a little chat with Barry.

621
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,161
Jan is on five if you want him.

622
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,579
Hey, Phil baby.

623
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,457
- What's Barry up to?
- He's on a call.

624
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,792
OK, um...

625
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,003
I'm just gonna poke my head in, OK?

626
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,213
Here's the deal.
I spoke to the studio...

627
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,548
...this afternoon.

628
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,509
OK, I agree.
It's exactly what I said to them.

629
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,196
It's exactly what I said. That should be
the interest on what they're paying you.

630
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
OK, bye.

631
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,806
Hey.

632
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,058
How are you doing?

633
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,561
Oh! I'm having one of those days.

634
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,146
You've got some good clients, Barry.

635
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,064
My biggest client's Constanza.

636
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,191
She's... you know,
she's an Oscar winner.

637
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:41,862
But she's either too old, or she's too dyky,
and now she tells me she wants to direct.

638
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,863
Is she available?

639
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,782
There's a couple of independent projects
I have with her, but, um...

640
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,285
Danny McTeague is interested in her
for "Weeds".

641
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,162
Oh, "Weeds". Yeah, what part?

642
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,205
Beth, opposite Don West.

643
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,560
Are you serious?
You know about those two, don't you?

644
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,418
How strange is that!

645
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,503
Love is stranger than shit.

646
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,007
Hello?

647
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,135
Constanza!

648
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,304
- Hi, darling, how are you?
- 'Fine.'

649
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,807
Small little favor,
would you check the draft of "Weeds"

650
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,477
and make sure that you're reading
the right version?

651
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,146
Amanda, can you see
my copy of "Weeds"?

652
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,024
Not there, inside, on the counter.
One second.

653
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,403
All I wanna know is,
is it set in Alabama?

654
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,656
Alabama? No, no, no...
The version I read is in, uh...

655
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,368
LA, I think.

656
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:32,788
In LA, I see.
Well, you got the wrong draft, honey.

657
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,831
'You understand
it's opposite Don West?'

658
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,708
Uh-huh.

659
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,502
'You know,
you'd be spending some time...

660
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,922
'...in Alabama with Don West.'

661
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,091
Um, well...

662
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,009
Honey, you know what?

663
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,262
I'll read it. I'll read it again,
keeping that in mind,

664
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,306
and I'll call you right away.

665
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,891
OK?

666
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,187
The deed is done.

667
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,605
"The deed is done", my ass!

668
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,792
I mean, all she said was
she was gonna call you back.

669
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:01,942
Lucy!

670
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,360
Put my calls into Tarzana.

671
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,115
Forgive the intrusion.
Forgive the intrusion.

672
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,324
What the hell's...?

673
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,451
Hello?

674
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,080
- It's for you.
- Put it on speakerphone.

675
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,205
This had better be good.

676
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,917
'Ivan, my dear, dear friend,
how are you?'

677
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,128
I'm very well, Don. How are you?

678
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,881
'Congratulations to you. You've
done it all. You owe yourself a blowjob.'

679
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,341
Ah-ha!

680
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,592
So you're doing "Weeds"?

681
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,261
'Uh, yes, I think I'm gonna like

682
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:32,931
'being "Weeding" with Constanza Vero
for four months.'

683
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,518
Now, tell me something,
what about Ted?

684
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,539
'What in the hell are you talking about?
Why in hell should I contact Ted?

685
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,940
- 'Ted's out. You're in.'
- Guys!

686
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,775
We now represent Don West.

687
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,112
Congratulations!

688
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,001
What did Don say?

689
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,126
We signed Don.

690
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,796
Oh, my God! Good job! Good job!

691
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,047
Here are your phone sheets.

692
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,258
- Thank you, honey.
- I can't believe it.

693
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,343
Now, who is Jackie?

694
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,470
Oh.

695
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,055
She says it's urgent,
it's about your insurance.

696
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,974
Huh! OK.

697
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,937
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Yeah. Congratulations.

698
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,270
Thanks.

699
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,902
- Jackie?
- 'Speaking.'

700
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,278
Oh, hi, it's Ivan Beckman.

701
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,280
'Oh, hi, Ivan. Finally!

702
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,491
'Your doctor wants to see you.'

703
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:34,367
Um, so what's up?

704
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,787
'He wants you to come on in,
so he can talk about your test results.'

705
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,414
Anything specific?

706
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:42,584
'No, he just left me a note. He wanted me
to call you and have you come in.'

707
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,795
I see. Well, you know,
I don't have much time, Jackie.

708
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,064
I don't know when I can come in.

709
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,591
'Well, you need to try
and come in today.'

710
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,009
Uh-huh.

711
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,554
Um... You've got nothing to say,
nothing in particular?

712
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,348
'No, he just left me this note.

713
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,393
'He said to give you a call,
he wants to see you.

714
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,477
'He said he'd stay late.
He knows you're busy.

715
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,687
'So, what time's good for you?'

716
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,106
Uh... Oh, I don't know.

717
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,985
'Ivan, you know, could you bring
somebody along with you?

718
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,655
'Maybe you have a friend
or something?'

719
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,573
I'll see what I can do, Jackie.

720
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,660
'Well, if you can,
just bring somebody with you.'

721
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,454
- OK.
- 'Alright.'

722
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,456
- Thank you.
- 'See you later.'

723
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:28,796
Hey!

724
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,091
Beckman!

725
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,677
You are huge!

726
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,555
Thank you.

727
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,306
Look how impressed everybody is.

728
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,268
- I'm gone for the rest of the day.
- Celebrating?

729
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:42,873
Ivan, I don't know
how you do it, man.

730
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,230
- Have a great time.
- Uh, thanks.

731
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:46,856
Way to go, baby.

732
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,275
What are you doing?

733
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,570
I cannot goof off right now.
Too much to do.

734
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,113
Look at all this stuff.

735
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,532
Go! Have fun!

736
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,158
You've been very good to me, Lucy.

737
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,284
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

738
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,036
Thank you. Go have fun.
Get out of here.

739
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,329
Did Charlotte call?

740
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,998
Yes. Sorry.

741
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:06,167
She called, and she said that she's sorry
she was such a bitch last night.

742
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,293
It was PMS.

743
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,421
Why didn't you tell me before?

744
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,215
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I was so distracted, it's so great.

745
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,216
OK, Lucy.

746
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,467
- Thank you.
- Hey, have fun.

747
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,177
Bye, Ivan,
I'll be here if you need me.

748
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,061
Jesus!

749
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:31,975
'Hi, you've reached Charlotte.

750
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,154
'Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.'

751
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,781
Hi Charlotte, it's Ivan.
Please call me.

752
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,242
It's important.
I need to speak to you, OK?

753
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,535
Thanks, I'm in my car.

754
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,662
Ivan?

755
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,830
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

756
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,123
Thank you.

757
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,917
OK.

758
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,961
Well...

759
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,798
There is nothing to worry about.

760
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,719
However,
right here on the left lung...

761
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,264
- This is a suspicious area.
- Yes.

762
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:06,645
Is it cancer?

763
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,898
Well, let me ask you,

764
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:13,610
do you get sudden shortness of breath?

765
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,364
I do sometimes. Well...

766
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:18,490
Yes.

767
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:24,746
Do you get persistent pains
in the chest or upper back?

768
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,290
If I sleep strange...

769
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,376
...my chest hurts sometimes, yes.

770
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,378
Do you cough a lot?

771
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,588
In the morning, but who doesn't?

772
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,174
Yeah, who doesn't?

773
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,967
Do you ever cough up blood?

774
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,963
Oh, I'll definitely go...

775
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,757
Ivan!

776
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,216
- Bobby!
- How are you doing?

777
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,676
I'm good, how are you?

778
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,571
Great! Looks like you hit
the mother lode tonight.

779
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:04,595
The infamous Bobby.

780
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,472
- Melanie.
- Nice to meet you.

781
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,723
Nice to meet you, too.

782
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,309
- Jessie. Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

783
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,019
- Francesca.
- Nice to meet you.

784
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,144
We've met.

785
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,314
Little, um...

786
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,900
- You know the place.
- I think I do.

787
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:20,403
Would you girls excuse me
for just a little second?

788
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,447
- A tiny moment, then.
- Tiny!

789
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,283
Cos you know how much fun
you can have with three girls later.

790
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,328
You're a good man, Bobby.
You're a good man.

791
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:30,580
It's always good to see you, Ivan.

792
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,791
You're a knight in shining armor.

793
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,251
I like to take care of the people I love.

794
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,961
Oh, thank you, Bobby.

795
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,215
Oh...

796
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,133
Yeah, I kinda need this.

797
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,847
That's about that, right there.

798
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:48,972
Ah, thanks.

799
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,268
Go ahead, do that up.

800
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:01,694
- I don't know where they went, Bob.
- This is depressing.

801
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,321
Can I borrow your phone?

802
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,870
Goddamn bitches!

803
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,372
'Hello?'

804
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,791
- Hello, Francesca?
- 'Ivan!'

805
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:15,916
Hey, baby!

806
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,502
- 'Hey!'
- Where are you?

807
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,587
'Look up.
We're in the penthouse.'

808
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,548
You're in the penthouse.

809
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:22,674
'Come find us.'

810
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,678
Go up and have a good time.
Uh-oh!

811
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,472
- Ivan! Ivan!
- Danny!

812
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,891
- Ivan!
- Danny boy!

813
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,394
- Danny boy!
- How did you find me?

814
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,354
How are you? What are you doing?

815
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,231
You should be an actor.

816
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:41,901
See that man?
You see that man behind you?

817
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,487
He can't hold a candle to you.

818
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,824
You know why I want you
to represent me?

819
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:48,992
"Weeds" is gonna happen.

820
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,160
- It's going west.
- "Weeds" is gonna happen.

821
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,412
Hey, Bobby! Bobby!

822
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,914
All of my career was...

823
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,958
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

824
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,894
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna be an actor?

825
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,088
Cos if I can make it,
anybody can make it.

826
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,333
Could we have a cab, please?

827
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,758
I'm Danny!

828
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:08,094
I know! "Weeds", man, "Weeds".

829
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,679
- Don West.
- I know.

830
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,806
- And you be good!
- Alright.

831
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,017
- This guy's gonna take care of him.
- OK, great.

832
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,030
- Don't get caught up in the door, Bobby.
- Story of my life.

833
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,202
Come here, Bobby. Come here, Bobby.
What are you shy about?

834
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,496
Oh, that's so lame!

835
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,291
Shh! Shh!

836
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,836
- And who would be at the door?
- Ivan. Ivan Beckman.

837
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,087
Ivan Beckman!

838
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,090
You mean that good-for-nothing
cocksucker of an agent?

839
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,260
You mean that faggot
cow fucker of an agent?

840
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,680
You mean that
ball, prick, cock sucking...

841
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,849
That's what I think about you,
fucking Ivan Beckman.

842
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,893
Jesus, that was wonderful!

843
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,706
My fucking mother is Irish.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this.

844
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,316
- Maybe I use it in this...
- You had me totally fooled.

845
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,318
Maybe I'll use it in this movie...

846
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,087
- In this movie, "Pubes".
- My friend Bobby.

847
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,551
- Don West.
- Hi, Bobby. How are you?

848
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:11,115
- He's a great provider.
- Is he? Provider of what?

849
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,700
I need no provisions.

850
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,495
I need no... no provisions.

851
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,038
You know,
Danny McTeague just left.

852
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,415
Did he? I just caught him
in the elevator.

853
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,959
Was he in fine form?

854
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,585
He seemed to be...

855
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,438
- sort of, like, a little bit...
- Look at this.

856
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,464
...you know,
tending the Irish flute.

857
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,633
- Come on! Attaboy!
- Be the man.

858
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,386
I thought I was supposed
to grab her nipple.

859
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:35,723
- You want to grab her nipple?
- I think that's what we were doing before.

860
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,518
Watch, this is what she was doing.

861
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,853
- Grab it.
- Ah!

862
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,063
Show it.

863
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,272
Whoo!

864
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:47,110
That just makes me wanna have
a cardiac fucking arrest.

865
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:50,363
How am I supposed to go home
to the wife and kids?

866
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:54,075
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Where did you get these?

867
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,285
Come on, let's continue.

868
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,430
You can't get off, man,
cos we're bored with ourselves.

869
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,534
We've already been naked
and put our clothes back on.

870
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,167
Speak for yourself, Don.

871
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,003
We've done bestiality and all that,

872
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:08,256
and I think found out that yes,
I did fuck a chicken when I was young.

873
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,219
Tell me, Don...

874
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:16,014
Have you...

875
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,933
or do you...

876
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,145
wanna fuck Charlotte,
my girlfriend?

877
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,647
Uh-oh. You don't wanna know her.

878
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:28,026
I can't believe it!

879
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,029
Terrible!

880
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,782
Just answer the question, Don.

881
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,577
Ivan, for you
I'll answer the question, look...

882
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,413
You know, you put the girl's pussy
in my face, what am I gonna do?

883
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,832
Am I gonna wanna fuck her?
Have I ever fucked her?

884
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,501
You know, she's...
You know what?

885
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:50,006
Charlotte's got a bad case
of the bitch goddess.

886
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,717
As Hemingway said, "Ambition, baby."

887
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,469
She ain't for you.

888
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:55,845
She's a traitor.

889
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,182
You're gonna put her pussy in my face
and ask me if I wanted to fuck her? Yeah.

890
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:00,475
Have I fucked her?

891
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,894
- Have I fucked her, Ivan?
- Have you? Have you?

892
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:04,187
Have I really fucked her?

893
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:07,190
Why would you even give a shit
if I fucked her or not?

894
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,316
Why is that? Why is that?

895
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,943
Because if she's cheap enough
to fucking wear no underwear

896
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,488
and open up her dress,
so I can snort stuff off her snatch,

897
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,782
why do you even care about this?

898
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,200
You're king of the hill, Ivan,

899
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,786
but she's not in it for your deal,
she's in it for hers.

900
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:22,580
She's in it just like every other ski pole
in this town.

901
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:25,124
But if I had a chance
to fuck your girlfriend? Yeah!

902
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,727
I'd fuck her
in every fucking orifice she has,

903
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,878
and run her out of this town
on a fucking flag pole.

904
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,982
I could fuck all five
of these girls right here.

905
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,257
I'm sorry, Don.

906
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,719
Bobby here got me into
a little sort of paranoiac kind of fit.

907
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:40,056
Bobby kept on asking me
about your girl, right, Bobby?

908
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,850
- And he was a little concerned about his girl.
- He's all over it.

909
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,144
OK, here's what, blow him!

910
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,522
What?

911
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,941
- Blow him.
- No!

912
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:52,044
Melanie, you have to,
or you'll have to leave the room.

913
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:53,462
That's the rule, and you know that.

914
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,571
- Come on!
- So what?

915
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,532
Don't be a...

916
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:00,535
Don't be a party pooper.
You either do it, or you leave the room.

917
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,286
- Come on, baby!
- No.

918
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,348
"No" what? No, you're not gonna leave
the room, or no, you're not gonna blow him?

919
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,124
I'm not going. I'm not leaving, OK?

920
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,750
- You're not leaving?
- No.

921
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,795
You don't have to put the vodka
on my Gianni Versace suit.

922
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,506
Can we get a little peace and quiet
in the domicile,

923
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,800
since yours truly is picking up the tab?

924
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,469
- Wait, wait, wait!
- OK, I'm out of it.

925
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,595
OK, it's fine.

926
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,430
You're gonna go do it? Go do it.

927
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:23,307
She's a sport. She's good.

928
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,434
I can do it.
I'm a big girl, I can do it.

929
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,939
- Let's see if he's hung like a donkey.
- Alright!

930
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,984
- Go, girl! Go, girl! Go, girl!
- Jessica!

931
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,403
All work and no play?

932
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,822
- Tragic!
- Do you have a bill?

933
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,365
Speaking of blowjobs...

934
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,159
Do you have a bill, baby?

935
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,202
Ah, have fun.

936
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,413
You can't watch! That's not fair.

937
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,540
Listen for the slurping. Donnie!

938
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,422
You don't have to do anything.

939
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,509
Hello, Mr. Dog.

940
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:46,761
Hello, baby.

941
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,429
Hello.

942
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,029
- Hello?
- 'Ivan!

943
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,280
- 'It's Lucy.'
- Hey, Lucy.

944
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,406
'It's 11:15.

945
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,368
'The staff meeting started,
and Tarzana's been calling for you.'

946
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:13,162
But, uh... Don't worry about it,
I'll be in soon.

947
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,955
- Oh, actually, Lucy?
- 'Yeah?'

948
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,084
Um, would you call
the AAA guy for me, please?

949
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:21,212
'Why, did your car...
Did you have a crash?'

950
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,671
No, I didn't have a crash.

951
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,840
- Just a flat tire.
- 'OK.'

952
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,008
- OK?
- 'Yeah, I'll call.'

953
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,133
- Thank you.
- 'OK, bye.'

954
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,344
Bye.

955
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,640
Oh, Jesus!

956
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,482
Oh, Jesus!

957
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:47,988
Hey, how are you doing?
Are you Ivan Beckman?

958
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,114
Yes, I am.

959
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,742
- Yeah, see, you have a flat tire.
- A puncture, yeah.

960
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,507
I can get you up and going
in ten minutes,

961
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,347
but I need to see
your membership card first.

962
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:56,664
OK.

963
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,918
- Hi!
- Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing here?

964
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,110
- Let's go.
- Come here.

965
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,695
- What?
- Come here.

966
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:15,826
Ivan!

967
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,500
Ivan!

968
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,420
Ivan!

969
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,214
I guess you have something
to celebrate.

970
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,965
I'm sorry I'm so late.

971
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,467
Have you seen the papers?

972
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,093
No, I haven't.

973
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:36,931
"West Ankles East.
From Zimbalist To Beckman."

974
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,350
And this in "Verité"!

975
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,728
Beckman! Beckman!

976
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,605
Beckman! Beckman...!

977
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:06,919
Hi, I'm Ira Reuther.

978
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,170
Ivan Beckman.

979
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,256
Hi. Call me Ira.
May I call you Ivan?

980
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,381
Certainly.

981
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,427
And... do me a favor,
just sit right over there, please.

982
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:16,762
Thank you.

983
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:20,432
OK, I'm gonna go behind my desk

984
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:23,769
and assess certain
of your physiological responses.

985
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,647
How's your sleep been
in the last two or three months?

986
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,148
It's OK.

987
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,525
Nothing unusual.

988
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,277
In terms of your sexual functioning,

989
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,862
whether it's with somebody else
or masturbating,

990
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:34,989
is your plumbing working?

991
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,314
- The plumbing seems to be working, yes.
- That's great.

992
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,996
I'm not gonna write this.

993
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,391
Do you mind if I smoke, by the way?
I'm addicted to these.

994
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,250
- Please do.
- Thank you.

995
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,462
Speaking of addiction,

996
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,799
what kinds of drugs, if any, do you use?

997
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,676
Um...

998
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,470
no more than anybody else, really.

999
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,348
In your crowd, what's anybody else?

1000
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:07,646
Well, let's say I live
a little bit in the fast lane, and...

1001
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,523
What are the drugs in the fast lane?

1002
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,900
Well, there's a certain amount of...

1003
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,279
of, um... cocaine

1004
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:18,449
and the occasional little pill.

1005
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:21,452
And the cocaine - once a week,
once a month, once a year?

1006
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,289
Depending on what's going on
that week or that year, basically.

1007
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:26,248
OK.

1008
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,919
Um, if there are lots of functions and
people and clients are enjoying themselves,

1009
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:32,338
well, I'll go with the flow.

1010
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,549
I see.
What about your use of alcohol?

1011
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:38,135
Alcohol, uh... an occasional binge.

1012
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,660
- An occasional binge? How occasional?
- An occasional binge.

1013
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:43,015
Once a week,
once a month, once a year?

1014
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,436
Once a week.
Let's say, a sort of weekend alcoholic.

1015
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,773
Thank you.

1016
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,775
So, what brings you here?

1017
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,610
Well, as I said, uh...

1018
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:58,364
my doctor mentioned
that I should speak to someone.

1019
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,783
OK.

1020
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,493
Do you know about what?

1021
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:09,124
Um...

1022
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,835
Well, just recently I...

1023
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,588
um...

1024
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,841
was diagnosed
with some sort of cancer.

1025
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,761
I don't really know what it is.
There was a spot on my lung.

1026
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:25,015
And I was asked to call an oncologist.

1027
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,729
I'd better put this out.

1028
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:33,774
Uh...

1029
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,653
Have you called the oncologist?

1030
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,029
I haven't, no.

1031
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,698
Pretty scary, huh?

1032
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,492
A little scary, yes.

1033
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,494
Are you anxious about that?

1034
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:47,579
I am.

1035
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:52,584
I noticed on your intake sheet

1036
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,254
that your mom is deceased.
What did she die of?

1037
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,382
She died of, um... cancer.

1038
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:09,852
Ivan, do you have the number
or the card of the oncologist on you?

1039
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,896
I do somewhere, yes.

1040
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,399
Do you think we should call?

1041
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,192
Would you like me to call for you?

1042
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,821
It might be a good idea.

1043
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:25,868
Excuse me.

1044
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:58,817
Well, hello! Hello!

1045
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,403
Afternoon!

1046
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:05,115
Hmm!

1047
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:06,992
How are you feeling today?

1048
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,786
I'm fine. How are you?

1049
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:10,662
Fine!

1050
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:11,789
Never better.

1051
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:26,845
Hello?

1052
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,263
So, did you read it?

1053
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,848
'Uh, read what?'

1054
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:32,559
My script I sent over.

1055
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,312
Your script... I'm sorry, honey.

1056
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,148
Are you mad at me
from the other night still?

1057
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,733
'No, of course not.'

1058
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,361
Is that why you haven't read it?

1059
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,488
'Oh, no, no, no.

1060
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:46,933
'I've just been very busy.
I've had a bit of a rough week.'

1061
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,910
Well, what are you doing tonight?

1062
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,037
I'm having dinner with my dad.

1063
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,832
I don't know if you want to come,
you know?

1064
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,343
Here, doggie.

1065
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,685
Well, baby...

1066
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,270
that was very quick.

1067
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,987
How come you weren't at that party
in the penthouse?

1068
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,281
Oh, I had a little bit of a rough week,
you know?

1069
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:28,574
Did you?

1070
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,200
Yeah.

1071
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,537
I got just the cure for that.

1072
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,539
Martin was there.

1073
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:37,457
- Oh, Martin was there?
- Martin was there.

1074
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,710
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, our good old friend Martin.

1075
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:40,878
Uh-huh.

1076
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,131
That ought to perk you up, I think.

1077
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,550
All rolled and ready, and...

1078
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,802
So, how have you been?

1079
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,346
OK. I've had a little bit of a rough week.
Um...

1080
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:53,724
A rough week, my ass!

1081
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:56,268
Mr. Don West's agent!

1082
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,478
How cool is that?

1083
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,063
Everybody was talking about it.

1084
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,571
Like, I need another line,
but... oh, well.

1085
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:15,662
That ought to help get us through dinner
with Daddy tonight.

1086
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,916
Thanks for coming.

1087
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,627
- Whoo!
- You're looking good.

1088
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:24,838
Yeah, I lost a few pounds
since you saw me last.

1089
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,936
You know you don't have
to lose any weight.

1090
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,845
Oh, yeah, try and butter me up.

1091
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,684
So, come here.

1092
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,478
How are you?

1093
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,772
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

1094
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,985
Go on... through!

1095
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:51,573
Now that I think about it,
maybe I should've stopped at my house.

1096
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,077
Look, there's Dad.

1097
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,914
Hey, Dad.

1098
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,336
- So, this is one of yours?
- No.

1099
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,171
No? It's... It's quite cool.

1100
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,798
It's a lot of paint.

1101
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,802
Now, this one's good!

1102
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,197
Do you have any of your own artwork
around the house?

1103
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,389
Oh, my God!

1104
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,182
Sis!

1105
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,018
- Hi, Ivan. How are you?
- I'm good.

1106
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,729
- And you? How are you?
- I'm good.

1107
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,189
That's my girlfriend, Charlotte.

1108
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,941
- Marcia.
- Hello, how are you?

1109
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:28,610
- Hi, Marcia. From New York, right?
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

1110
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,112
Very nice to meet you.

1111
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,957
- Tequila for everybody.
- Nice to meet you.

1112
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,825
- So, what do you do?
- What do you mean, what do I do?

1113
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:36,702
She's an artist in her own right.

1114
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,203
What type of art?

1115
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:42,040
Um, well, actually right now
I'm studying the human form.

1116
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,292
You know, nudes.

1117
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,538
Marcia was just about to show us
some of her drawings.

1118
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,046
Would you like to see them?

1119
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,632
- Oh, yeah!
- Dad, they don't wanna see my stuff.

1120
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:56,179
This is the type of stuff I do.
Dad, what do you think?

1121
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,265
Same old stuff, basically, isn't it?

1122
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,392
- No.
- No.

1123
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,686
It's all new, Ivan.

1124
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,131
- You haven't seen this stuff.
- Let me see that first one.

1125
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:08,483
Yeah, I think you're really starting
to get the smell.

1126
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,443
You think so?

1127
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:12,070
Ivan, I want to show you something.

1128
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,321
That's cool.

1129
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,867
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Yeah, she was really something.

1130
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:17,992
Huh!

1131
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:23,040
God, thanks a lot, Dad,
for showing me those.

1132
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,502
Manny tells me you made
a big splash this week.

1133
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,922
Yeah, I did.
Pretty happy about it.

1134
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:33,091
Tarzana must be very pleased with you.

1135
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,886
Yeah, she's been really good to me.

1136
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:40,474
She wants money. She's only interested
in artists who bring her money.

1137
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,725
Well, she's an agent.

1138
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:48,231
I know it's very difficult to maintain
a sense of decency in that kind of life.

1139
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,734
It's my life, isn't it, Dad?

1140
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:53,153
Dinner! It's ready.

1141
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,405
My environment's where I live.
It's what I do.

1142
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,576
My son, the talent merchant.
Come on.

1143
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:04,831
- I think that girlfriend of yours is...
- Charlotte!

1144
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,000
Charlotte!

1145
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,762
Sit down here.

1146
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,247
- I had to freshen up a bit.
- This is Ivan's favorite food.

1147
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,602
So, what were you guys
talking about in there?

1148
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,648
The industry, I assume?

1149
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:31,983
Yes.

1150
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,568
Somewhat.

1151
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,947
- It's funny.
- What's funny?

1152
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:39,658
So funny how seriously
you take that stuff.

1153
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:40,992
So funny.

1154
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,160
What's that?

1155
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,703
- Oh, sorry.
- Is that curry?

1156
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,624
- No.
- No?

1157
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,294
You guys hardly took anything.

1158
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:56,091
No, I'm not that hungry
anyway. I had a big lunch, so...

1159
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:58,093
You had a big lunch?

1160
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,469
It's almost 9:30.

1161
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:04,641
Yeah, you know,
I went to a happy hour party,

1162
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:07,310
I had some hors d'oeuvres,
I'm not really that hungry.

1163
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:10,814
I wasn't planning on having dinner.
I just came along for the company.

1164
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,861
I know what's going on.

1165
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:19,781
Ivan's got himself messed up
with another cokehead girlfriend.

1166
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,992
Oh, Jesus, Marcia, will you shut up?

1167
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:23,326
No, I'm not gonna shut up.

1168
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,451
Look at her! She hasn't stopped sniffing
since she came out of the bathroom.

1169
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,460
For your information,
I'm on anti-depressants.

1170
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:33,420
Mm-hmm.

1171
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:36,298
I know it makes me appear
to be a little...

1172
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,384
What?

1173
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,803
No, it was fucking funny. I'm sorry.

1174
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:46,266
It's more than funny.
It's hilarious.

1175
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,767
Anyway, I'm on anti-depressants,

1176
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:50,520
and it makes me a little bit
nervous-acting, so...

1177
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,063
- Mm-hmm.
- ...excuse me.

1178
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,483
It's perfectly understandable.
You don't have to explain.

1179
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,528
Well, she's accused me
of being on coke.

1180
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,575
I'm sure it wouldn't be that, uh...

1181
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,869
- What?
- Well, that's enough.

1182
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:10,081
- No, it's not enough, Dad!
- You're bickering like you always have.

1183
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:11,708
Bicker, bicker, bicker.

1184
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,085
Can we just have a nice family dinner?

1185
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:17,255
This is what I call a nice family dinner.

1186
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,028
It is what you call a nice family dinner,
isn't it, Marcia?

1187
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:24,429
- Well... you know what?
- What?

1188
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,098
- If I can't be honest with you, Ivan...
- Yeah?

1189
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,600
...then who's going to be?

1190
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:29,725
Honest about what?

1191
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:32,270
Charlotte is gonna be honest with you?

1192
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:34,648
Pray, be honest.

1193
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:35,774
I will.

1194
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,776
I'm sorry,
what are you bringing me into?

1195
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,987
You're dragging... What kind of family
argument are you dragging me into?

1196
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,864
I'm not dragging you into anything.

1197
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,908
Actually, I've heard enough from you.

1198
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,035
OK, that's enough.

1199
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,121
Ivan, we all love you very much.

1200
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,808
And I have completely lost my appetite.

1201
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,960
Yeah, but, I mean, what...
you love me,

1202
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:57,128
but you still think what I do is stupid.

1203
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,650
- That's right.
- You would agree with that, wouldn't you?

1204
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:02,300
Of course I do.

1205
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,554
Ivan, you're gonna drown!

1206
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,140
- You're gonna drown.
- OK, OK, enough!

1207
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,977
I wish Mom was here in a way,
you know?

1208
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:15,563
Well, you know what?
Mom's not here. Mom's dead.

1209
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,159
Charlotte?

1210
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,453
What?

1211
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,706
What is it, Ivan?

1212
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:35,500
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that was for me?

1213
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,849
There you go.

1214
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,328
'Hi, you've reached Charlotte.

1215
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,705
'Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back. Bye.'

1216
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:19,085
Hey Charlotte, it's Ivan.

1217
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,504
Um, could you call me back, please?

1218
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:23,389
It's quite important.
I need to speak to you.

1219
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,300
There's something
I need to tell you tonight.

1220
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:36,061
I'm sorry, Mr. Dog.

1221
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:37,312
I'm sorry.

1222
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,522
I'm sorry.
Have I been neglecting you?

1223
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,483
I've been neglecting you, hmm?

1224
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,109
I've been neglecting you.

1225
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,944
I'm sorry, Mr. Dog.

1226
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:46,529
I'm sorry.

1227
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:05,765
- 'Hi, you've reached Charlotte.'
- Oh, fuck!

1228
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,042
- 'Please leave a message. I'll call you back.'
- Fuck!

1229
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,053
Ugh!

1230
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,889
Hello?

1231
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,517
'Ivan! I have someone here
who wants to talk to you.'

1232
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:16,851
Francesca!

1233
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,061
Hi!

1234
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:19,521
'How are you?'

1235
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:21,564
- I'm good and you?
- 'I'm good.'

1236
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,442
Why don't you come up here?

1237
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,694
'Oh, is it the same deal as before?'

1238
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,072
Why not?
That sounds interesting to me.

1239
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:30,508
'Do you want me to bring Jessie?'

1240
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:31,866
Yeah, bring Jessie.

1241
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,163
♪ La-la! ♪

1242
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,104
Hello?

1243
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:02,229
'Hi!'

1244
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,940
Hey, Charlotte. Hi.

1245
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,584
'What are you doing?
Why are you so out of breath?'

1246
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:08,611
Oh! I've been listening to music,
that's all.

1247
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,864
- 'Poor thing.'
- I'm so happy you called.

1248
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:13,575
'Are you sure you weren't
spanking the monkey?'

1249
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,160
No.

1250
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,873
'So what is it that
you have to tell me, Ivan?

1251
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:22,375
'I feel terrible, terrible right now,
and I'm sorry.'

1252
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,751
I'm sorry, honey.

1253
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:27,213
'No, I'm sorry. I was yelling.
I don't know what was wrong with me.'

1254
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:29,132
I know, I was being a little weird, too.

1255
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:31,676
'Too much coke or something.

1256
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,013
'So, what is it?'

1257
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:40,602
Darling, do you think
we could speak in the morning?

1258
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,746
- I'm about to go to sleep.
- 'Is that your doorbell?'

1259
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,023
I don't think it's my...
I don't know what it is.

1260
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:47,192
'No, that's definitely your doorbell.
Who's there?'

1261
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:49,402
I don't know.
I'm not expecting anybody, honey.

1262
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:53,031
'Mm. So, why don't you go see who it is
and come back and tell me?'

1263
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,450
Uh, no, I'd rather speak to you
in the morning, baby.

1264
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:57,452
I'm just so tired, I can't tell you.

1265
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,454
'Do you mind if I come over?'

1266
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,581
It'd be better you didn't.

1267
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,042
Why don't we have breakfast?

1268
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,668
Would that be OK?

1269
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,171
Charlotte?

1270
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:10,340
'I think you'd better go
answer the fucking door.'

1271
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,178
Shit!

1272
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,724
Well, hello!

1273
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,434
Hi, puppy.

1274
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,144
Hi, cutie.

1275
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,270
Hi!

1276
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,232
- So, whose turn is it?
- Turn for what?

1277
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:28,441
Truth or dare, baby.

1278
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,626
Huh!

1279
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:52,215
That is...

1280
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,175
You bite it first.

1281
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,636
Mm...!

1282
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,012
Very good!

1283
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:02,976
OK, Ivan.

1284
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,894
- What?
- Truth or dare?

1285
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,354
Oh...

1286
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:08,314
OK, truth.

1287
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,482
I'll be boring.

1288
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:11,818
OK, Ivan.

1289
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,904
How many drugs
are you on right now?

1290
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:17,407
How many?
You name them. Tell me.

1291
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,661
Half a pound of coke.

1292
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,746
Oh, at least!

1293
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,206
At the very least!

1294
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,543
Ecstasy.

1295
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,671
- Yeah!
- I witnessed that.

1296
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,548
- Um...
- There was something else.

1297
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:35,592
Smack?

1298
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:37,468
- Smack?
- Yeah, heroin.

1299
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:39,262
Smack?

1300
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:41,264
Um... no. No.

1301
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:43,182
I draw the line at smack.

1302
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:45,226
- Really?
- Yeah, I don't like smack.

1303
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,871
I don't like the idea of smack.
I don't like the concept of smack.

1304
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,206
Maybe I should.
Maybe I should try it.

1305
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,648
- Maybe you should.
- Yeah.

1306
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,533
- I think maybe I will.
- It's the next step.

1307
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,776
Yeah.

1308
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,446
I mean, why? Why do people
have the stigma against smack?

1309
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:57,822
Smack's great.

1310
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:58,947
I've decided.

1311
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:04,162
OK, but there's something as well,
I can tell.

1312
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,497
Cos you're not exactly buzzed like me.

1313
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,959
- Like, you haven't told me you love me.
- Oh, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1314
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,812
- There's something else.
- There <i>is</i> something else.

1315
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,480
- What else?
- What are you hiding from us?

1316
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:14,964
Tell the truth.

1317
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:20,678
Ooh!

1318
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,848
- Prescription?
- I mean, these things are great.

1319
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,350
- What are they?
- Let me see.

1320
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,560
It's my dog's medicine.

1321
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:34,233
My mother was taking those.

1322
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:36,110
- She was?
- Yeah.

1323
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,488
Oh, was she?

1324
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:41,366
- Uh-huh. That's good.
- She died of cancer.

1325
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:47,747
Those are for cancer.

1326
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,044
I have a cancer.

1327
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,675
A tumor in the lung.

1328
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,594
And it's killing me.

1329
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,788
You know,

1330
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,415
last night...

1331
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,753
I had this incredible pain.

1332
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:21,090
The pain was so strong that I took...

1333
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,761
every pill in the goddamn house.

1334
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,515
But... the pills wouldn't do anything.

1335
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,727
The pain wouldn't go away.

1336
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:37,190
So I tried to find an image,

1337
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:39,108
one worthwhile image...

1338
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:41,986
that would get me through it.

1339
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,783
And all I could find was shit.

1340
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:55,082
I couldn't find
one worthwhile goddamn thing.

1341
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,631
I just have this...

1342
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,512
this memory, I don't know,
I was maybe three, maybe four years old,

1343
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,306
and I remember my mother holding me...

1344
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:15,102
with her woolly sweater, and...

1345
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:17,438
my cheek against her breast.

1346
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,943
Ah, and she smelt so sweet...
smelt so sweet.

1347
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,619
So, what...

1348
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,260
What's gonna happen to my dog?

1349
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,476
Do you think animal control
is gonna take him?

1350
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:58,729
And put him away?

1351
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:02,775
Don't pity me.

1352
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,029
Huh! Why should you?

1353
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:14,287
Someday...

1354
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:20,877
Someday it'll happen to you, too.

1355
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,130
Your time will come.

1356
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:19,936
'9-1-1 emergency.'

1357
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:23,147
Well, this is regarding
disturbances on our street.

1358
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,650
- I don't know, we've had noise...
- 'Your name?'

1359
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:41,749
Settle down, settle down.

1360
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,418
There you go.
Come on, you're alright.

1361
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,090
You're gonna be OK.

1362
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,383
Just relax. Relax.

1363
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:51,842
Relax.

1364
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,554
There you go. There you go.

1365
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,598
Just relax now, OK?

1366
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:00,726
How much of that coke did you do?

1367
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,270
Huh? How much? Talk to me.

1368
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:05,439
727. Roll paramedics.

1369
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,423
'Dr. Warsawski to the OR.

1370
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:32,550
'Dr. Warsawski to the OR.'

1371
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:37,638
Good morning, everybody.

1372
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,643
The police found him combative
on his living room floor this morning.

1373
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,354
Very combative.
Rule out drug overdose.

1374
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:50,443
We found cocaine, alcohol, barbiturates,
everything but a needle on scene.

1375
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:52,820
- You don't know him?
- No history.

1376
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,071
He's not moving air.

1377
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,743
Take it easy, buddy. Take it easy.
What's your name?

1378
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:13,883
Sam, give him 100 sucks.

1379
01:24:14,008 --> 01:24:17,261
Can we get the suck fixed?
Is the line good?

1380
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,055
Give me a trach filter.

1381
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,226
Respiratory is here.

1382
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:26,621
Careful, there's blood coming from...

1383
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,397
Give me some suction.

1384
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:30,608
You've got the trach tube?

1385
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,693
The blade.

1386
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:36,322
- Alright, everybody.
- Jesus Christ! Trach him, goddammit!

1387
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:38,741
Spreaders.

1388
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:18,924
He's improving.

1389
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:21,218
Just having a hard time speaking.

1390
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:23,762
Ivan, I'm gonna put a pen
in your hand.

1391
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:25,639
Try and write a number...

1392
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,004
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

1393
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:30,788
Just push that if you need me, OK?

1394
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:33,812
