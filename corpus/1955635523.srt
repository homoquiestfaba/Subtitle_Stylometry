1
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:42,051
You must go back in time,
eliminate Billy and Mandy...

2
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,216
and act as their replacements...

3
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:47,488
until further instructions are given.

4
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:52,728
They are not to reach Horror's Hand
before the Lord of Horror.

5
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,165
Now go.

6
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,848
Remember back then, yo,
when we were young and innocent.

7
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,052
We need to get through
that vortex, Irwin.

8
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:23,790
Maybe we can make things right again
the way they were before...

9
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,388
Horror's Hand.

10
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,737
Yes.

11
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,244
Rats!

12
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:29,585
Oh, man!

13
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,648
I was so busy watching
the opening credits...

14
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,285
that I forgot to follow those
robots into the path...

15
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,693
through their post-dating
time travel vortex.

16
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,527
Hey, yo, don't worry.

17
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:42,365
Remember you drew up that schematic
for a time travel machine last night?

18
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,860
We can just build our own
time travel portal, go back through...

19
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:50,104
and save ourselves from this terrible
future caused by Horror's Hand!

20
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:53,374
That's right.
Get to work on it right away.

21
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:58,377
Billy, that's a drawing
of cops fighting dinosaurs.

22
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:01,546
What? They should be
working together.

23
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:04,216
We'll just have to wait and
hope that ourselves in the past...

24
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:07,283
figure out how to stop
the tragic sequence of events...

25
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,125
that led up to this awful future.

26
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:14,031
But doesn't the fact that we're here
mean that we don't?

27
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,661
You're right, I know.

28
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,898
Time travel is so confusing.

29
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,134
Besides is this future really so bad?

30
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,208
I mean, aside from all
of humanity being enslaved...

31
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,877
by the Lord of Horror.

32
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:50,665
Mornin', Death!

33
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,305
This is my favorite part of the job.

34
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,421
Reginald Skarr,
I have come for thee.

35
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,719
That's great.
Can you fix the antenna?

36
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:14,784
My one day off and
Shark Week 's coming in all fuzzy.

37
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:19,822
No! Reginald Skarr,
I have come for thee.

38
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:23,927
What?!
But I'm in perfect health.

39
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:29,631
What? This hole?
Well, it's just a flesh wound.

40
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,541
I don't even know where I got it.

41
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,443
Into the vortex with you.

42
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:37,342
And don't start cryin'
and drippin' snot all over me.

43
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:40,444
This robe has got to get me
through the week.

44
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,887
I'm busy, you rotten little munchkins.

45
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:44,480
Go play in traffic.

46
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:47,493
We're bored, Grim. We want you
to take us to work with you.

47
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:51,054
No way, I like to keep my work
life and my home life separate.

48
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,122
I think you misunderstood me.

49
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,760
I meant you will take us
to work with you.

50
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:59,802
You know, you'd have more friends
if you were little more pleasant.

51
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,364
I don't want more friends.
I have you.

52
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,639
And you promised
to be our best friend forever.

53
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:08,512
A best friend would definitely
bring us to work if he had a cool job.

54
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:10,209
Like a gorilla!

55
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,150
Or the Grim Reaper.

56
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,812
Well, I...

57
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:16,917
We've got a runner!

58
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,392
Aren't you forgetting something?

59
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:27,059
Was it my deodorant?

60
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,897
Oh no, that's you.

61
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:32,964
Fine, get on.

62
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:52,914
I'm OK.

63
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:00,326
This calls for track number 6.

64
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,634
You can't outrun Death.

65
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,073
That's why I have turbo.

66
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,280
You're not doing this right.
I'm driving.

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,289
Girls can't drive.
Everyone knows. Give me the...

68
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:30,820
Stop pulling.

69
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,997
Totally not my fault.

70
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:03,829
Time for the big guns.
Or should I say missiles?

71
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:24,176
I wonder what this one does.

72
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,450
Oh, now I remember.

73
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,417
I can't believe you two
scared off another one.

74
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:00,646
I've got a quota to meet.

75
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,554
They're dead, Grim.
They'll turn up sooner or later.

76
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,924
Your huggy bear is here
to maul you with love, yo.

77
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,428
Not now, Irwin.

78
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,731
My job could be on the line.
I have a reputation to uphold.

79
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,101
Jobs don't have
to be forever, Grim.

80
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:22,369
My dad starts a new job
almost every week.

81
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:23,898
Billy's right, Grim.

82
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,571
I've been fired before.
And it's not bad.

83
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:29,207
In fact,
I get fired all the time.

84
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,945
Why, just today I got fired
from my job at the Freckle Burger...

85
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,476
for eating all of the paper cups.

86
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,181
What was that, honey?

87
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:37,945
Nothing, Gladys!

88
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,788
Are you sure?
I could've sworn...

89
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,987
Me not speakee your language.

90
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,292
If you lost that job
at Freckle Burger...

91
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,231
Oh, oh, genie. Yub, yub...

92
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,791
Harold!

93
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:53,065
The point is, you kids can't be mixing
my business with your pleasure.

94
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,301
I can't keep losin' clients like this.

95
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,036
You're the only one who cares.

96
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:10,522
Hey, Grim.
How come you got moving zits?

97
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:13,623
It's the man!

98
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:25,228
Grim Reaper, you're under arrest
for misusing your powers...

99
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,738
and dereliction of duty.

100
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:29,731
He said "duty".

101
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,279
Order. Order.

102
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,909
I'll have a double
cheeseburger animal style.

103
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:16,478
But not if the animal is a porcupine
or a weasel or anything...

104
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:19,958
'cause then it would hurt
when you put it in your mouth.

105
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,326
Excuse me,
I think there's been a mistake.

106
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:24,796
Hey, how you doin'?

107
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,765
What is this? Why am I here?

108
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,291
You're here to pay
for abusing your powers.

109
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,244
The Boogey Man? Didn't we banish
you to the Nightmare Realm?

110
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,116
Yeah, but I'm not one to hold a grudge.

111
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:48,745
Well, maybe you ought to start.

112
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:52,053
I've never forgiven you for all
the mean stuff you did to me as a kid.

113
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,493
Grim, please. I was kidding.
I totally hold a grudge.

114
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,087
And when I learned
that these baboons...

115
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,326
were causing you to miss
work and abuse your powers...

116
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:04,496
Well, let's just say that I felt
it was my duty as a citizen...

117
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:07,995
to crush you and destroy
everything you love.

118
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,009
That's what I would do.

119
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,170
He said "duty".

120
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:16,739
Don't you find the justice
system fascinating?

121
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:20,241
What are you talkin' about, Boogey?
I've never abused my powers.

122
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,846
But I'm going to start
if you don't get out of my face.

123
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,016
Where were you when you met
Billy and Mandy?

124
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,927
That was the night these runts
won me in a limbo game.

125
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:33,693
I see. And where were you
on October 31st?

126
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,327
Well, it was Halloween.
That wasn't my fault.

127
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,597
Me scythe got stolen.

128
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:38,934
I wasn't anywhere near it...

129
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,462
when those giant pumpkins
wrecked half of Endsville.

130
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,670
Is it not true that not only
was your scythe stolen...

131
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,875
by a headless man wearing
a pumpkin on his neck...

132
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,785
but it was also taken by Billy,
Mandy, Irwin, Billy's father...

133
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:58,450
Billy's mother, Billy's cousin,
Billy's cat, Dracula...

134
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,722
General Skarr,
Principal Goodvibes, Mrs. Claus...

135
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:06,960
The Secret Snake Club, the Army,
Scout Troop 701, the Sleaze Tax...

136
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,298
The President, the Mailman,
the Dingleschmit Sisters...

137
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:13,897
The Boogey Man, a llama
and a turkey salad sandwich...

138
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,972
...hold the mayo?

139
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,739
Well, yeah. But...

140
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:24,813
He admits to irresponsibly
losing his scythe...

141
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,218
an epic and ancient tool filled
with terrible magics...

142
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:31,781
beyond mortal understanding
on multiple occasions.

143
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,456
I hate jury duty.

144
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,962
But it's not my fault.
It's these kids.

145
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,861
They're like lint brushes for trouble.

146
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:41,958
So you have no free will?

147
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:45,300
You must do what these mere
mortal children say?

148
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:46,703
Yes. Yes.

149
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:50,197
We're his bestest friends forever.

150
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,377
Bestest friends who steal...

151
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,710
powerful eldritch artifacts
from his trunk...

152
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:58,376
travel to forbidden planes
of existence...

153
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:02,217
and use the Grim Reaper's scythe
to unclog their toilets?

154
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,916
Yup, that's us.

155
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,059
It was a supernatural clog.

156
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:11,086
Would it be fair to say that
none of you would be friends...

157
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,688
if you didn't have to be?

158
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:15,860
That you're just using
the Grim Reaper for his powers?

159
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:19,065
And if he were suddenly powerless
he'd be useless to you?

160
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,505
Yeah, sounds fair to me.

161
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,601
I'd like to call to the stand
my first witness.

162
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,078
Myself.

163
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,911
Hello, I'm the Boogey Man.

164
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:37,454
Is it true that these stinking children
called you names...

165
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,390
and banished you
to a Nightmare Realm...

166
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,586
where the screaming
never stopped?

167
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:45,996
Yes, it's true. These children stink
and probably never bathe.

168
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:47,556
Yes. Yes.

169
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,192
He can't be serious.

170
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:52,329
If I recall correctly,
he can't be scary either.

171
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,032
It was horrible.

172
00:14:55,074 --> 00:15:00,910
Modern children are so hard to scare,
I was just trying to do my job.

173
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,676
Hang him.

174
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:05,980
Objection, the prosecutor
can't question himself.

175
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,520
Jeez! Is that true?

176
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,681
Well, in summation...

177
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,749
these deviants are
unbelievably barbaric...

178
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,420
wickedly loathsome...

179
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:19,397
prunish pimples on the face
of our brave and honorable society...

180
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:22,492
and they're mean to baby animals.

181
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,526
I rest my case.

182
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,869
Does the defense have
anything to say for itself?

183
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:30,740
- I want to plead guilty.
- Shut up!

184
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,768
Please, Judge, it's not my fault
that I'm not doing me job.

185
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,041
These kids won me in a bet.

186
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,708
Illegal gambling.

187
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,614
But I'll do anything
to get out of me contract.

188
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,779
Invalidating a legal
and binding contract.

189
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,722
Shut up, Boogey. Or I'll come
over there and make you shut up.

190
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,055
Assaulting an officer of the court.

191
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:49,220
I think I've seen enough.

192
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:50,957
Has the jury reached a verdict?

193
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,227
Stone him!

194
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,362
We the jury find the defendant...

195
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,394
innocent?

196
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:02,062
Yeah!

197
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:06,477
- You idiot, that says guilty.
- Guilty. Yes.

198
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,814
By the power vested in me
by this infernal court...

199
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:17,255
I hereby strip the Grim Reaper
of title, rank and powers...

200
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,726
and condemn him
and his accessories...

201
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,752
to immediate execution.

202
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,601
I'm sorry, that says "exile". My bad.

203
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,570
How could you do this, Boogey?

204
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:35,096
He doesn't like you.
Haven't you been listening?

205
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:38,440
Judge, don't worry,
I'll take them with me.

206
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:41,503
My crew and I were just going out
for a bit of a sail.

207
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:46,678
And I know the perfect place to...
drop them off.

208
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:51,047
Drop them off, drop them off.

209
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,153
Very well. I give custody
of the former Grim Reaper...

210
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,890
to the Boogey Man.

211
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,125
Please take him far, far away...

212
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,862
where he won't bother anyone
ever again.

213
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,629
You made your point,
Boogey.

214
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:10,767
Who are you going to get to be
the Grim Reaper instead of me, huh?

215
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,505
The kids next door?

216
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,570
Hey, come on, I know my rights.

217
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,844
You've got the right
to a butt-kicking. Right, boys?

218
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,586
I've cheated Death.

219
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,821
This is the greatest day of my life.

220
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,964
Time for a frosty beverage.

221
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:41,964
What's this?

222
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:49,944
Damn! You're those filthy
children that go door to door...

223
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:53,210
selling candy bars
for their school fundraiser.

224
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:56,480
Well, I'm busy and poor.

225
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,955
So go away and stop tracking
dirt on my lawn.

226
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,806
No sign of the targets.
We must enter the domicile.

227
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:27,975
Query.

228
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,451
Why are we eliminating
Billy and Mandy?

229
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,422
Our job is not to ask why.
We are programmed to obey.

230
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:43,794
They are gone.
I told you that it took too long.

231
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,959
Statement.

232
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,559
If I'd known robots had to pee...

233
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,763
I wouldn't have had that
32 pounds liquid coolant...

234
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,796
right before we time-traveled.

235
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,507
Hey, kids, Billy's mom's
a little upset right now...

236
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:58,844
as she'll have to go back to work
at the dog-kicking factory.

237
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:02,476
So I'm supposed to take you
to dinner far, far away from here.

238
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,148
Query.

239
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,057
Will you, Billy's father,
teach me all that you know...

240
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,061
so that I may better understand...

241
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:15,496
and thereby destroy
my pre-approved target?

242
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,026
Billy. I'd hoped
one day that you'd realize...

243
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:22,526
that I'm not just a father
but a father figure.

244
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:26,531
Come, let me share my knowledge
over a root beer.

245
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:29,636
Now, the first thing you gotta know
is that life is like a basketball.

246
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,237
It has its ups and its downs...

247
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:42,849
Hey, are you guys going
to the Grand Canyon...

248
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:44,359
on this cruise ship too?

249
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,418
No, we're prisoners.

250
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:50,865
I like cruise ships 'cause you
get a buffet and it has shrimp.

251
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,095
The buffet has shrimp?!

252
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,765
How did that guy from the jury
get on my ship?

253
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:01,106
I need to make poo-poo, I need
to make poo-poo real bad.

254
00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,408
I can't believe you got me fired, Boogey.

255
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:04,777
You can't keep me here.

256
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:08,341
Your stay here will be as brief
as your lives.

257
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:10,545
But we still get the buffet, right?

258
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:16,552
I'm not hungry, yo.
I want to go home!

259
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,891
Who's gonna be the Grim Reaper,
if I'm not the Grim Reaper?

260
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,357
Hey there, it's me.
Number 3.

261
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:29,269
I just wanted to thank you, Boogey,
for giving me this opportunity.

262
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:32,138
Thanks to you,
in addition to my charity work...

263
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:34,109
and love of rainbow monkeys...

264
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:37,840
I can now also reap
the immortal souls of grownups...

265
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,715
collecting my dark harvest
with a cold iron blade.

266
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,845
Yeah,
that will be fun.

267
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:51,485
She's on a six-week
trial period.

268
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:55,224
- If I had me powers right now!
- But you don't.

269
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:59,598
And without your powers
you can't be the scariest being alive.

270
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:00,966
That leaves the job to me.

271
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:04,564
Last time I checked,
butterflies were scarier than you.

272
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,569
You won't be saying that
after I sail...

273
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:13,309
to the Isle of Peril
and capture Horror's Hand.

274
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:16,182
My mom makes horrible ham.

275
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:18,881
I'd be happy to bring it to you
to save you the trip.

276
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:23,750
No, you doofwad. Horror's Hand.

277
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,762
It clutches in its mighty grip
the things we fear the most.

278
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:30,755
Horror's Hand?! With its power
I could be the scariest being alive.

279
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,529
I could easily
get me old job back.

280
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:36,470
Horror's Hand is the most
frightening object in the universe.

281
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,099
Horror's Hand makes you face
your deepest fear.

282
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:42,201
But if you conquer your fear
you can use the Hand's power...

283
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:45,703
to become an unstoppable force
of scariness.

284
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:56,924
Horror's Hand literally makes
your worst nightmares come to life.

285
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,792
When I enter the dreams
of children with the hand...

286
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,490
they will fear me again.

287
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:16,941
Mortals all over the world
will get so scared that they'd puke...

288
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,880
when they just hear the name,
Boogey Man.

289
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:22,782
Like that one lady puked
when I mentioned your name.

290
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:25,309
It was one date.
She didn't give me a chance.

291
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:38,427
Does that mean he does
or doesn't want the ham?

292
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:42,062
You're a hack, Boogey.
I've met marshmallows scarier than you.

293
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:45,198
Shall I set course
for the Burning Seas?

294
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:48,176
We could throw these punks
to the fire sharks.

295
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,906
Make it so, Mr. Creeper.

296
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,881
I usually think sharks
are scary...

297
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:58,250
but these fire sharks sound like
a fine lot of gentlemen to me.

298
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

299
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:15,134
it's time for a little game
called Walk the Plank.

300
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:18,902
Come on, Boogey, it's me you want,
not the kids. Let 'em go.

301
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,966
I don't think so.

302
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,137
Fine, take the kids. Let me go.

303
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,647
I'm going to miss you
the most, Grim.

304
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,486
This is just like Titanic.

305
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,513
I don't see why we have to walk
the plank.

306
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:38,652
We're not the ones who've been
your mortal enemies since the 6th grade.

307
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:41,458
True. But I really don't like children.

308
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,795
The feeling is mutual.

309
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:56,277
Come on in, the lava's fine.

310
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:00,607
That looks like fun. I wanna go first.

311
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,844
It's always nice to have a volunteer.

312
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,850
Hot down there. But it's a dry heat.

313
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:21,563
Dance, you little sausage, dance.

314
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,266
Do it.

315
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,441
I can't look.

316
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,778
Mommy!

317
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:36,011
Now are you scared?

318
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:04,271
Then pop his head open
like a gourd?

319
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:35,368
Grim, let's beat it while
they're distracted.

320
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,079
Not being kicked or keelhauled?

321
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,143
My goodness,
he's so brave and tall.

322
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,212
There's no braver boy
that I can recall.

323
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:22,451
I don't know if I'm thankful or appalled.

324
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,101
What is Billy doing?
We need to get out of here.

325
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,005
What do you mean
what am I doing?

326
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:17,877
I'm singing. There's always
songs in animated movies.

327
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:21,110
Get out of there or I'll give
you something to be scared of.

328
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,174
Over here.

329
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,858
Now that's scary.

330
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,448
It's a good thing I can't smell.

331
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:04,654
What I'm trying to say is
when a boy becomes a man...

332
00:28:04,693 --> 00:28:08,060
he gets super, super hairy. See?

333
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:11,965
Another root beer, son?

334
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,025
Statement.

335
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,127
Me like another root beer.

336
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:30,341
Gladys, I forgot. Does root beer
always make Billy's head explode?

337
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:36,649
OK, he's fine.

338
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:49,102
Yeah, good one, Captain.
You almost had me there.

339
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:52,036
Would it kill you to fake it just once?

340
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:56,534
Lt'll make the time when
you really scare me all the more special.

341
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,410
- Good point.
- Not that it'll ever happen.

342
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,814
What's the status on our escapees?

343
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,310
No sign of the ex-Grim Reaper
and his cronies.

344
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:09,957
We're also missing
a Deathboat which means...

345
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:12,483
they could be
out on the river.

346
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:14,758
Well, if they make it
to the Gatekeeper...

347
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:18,631
We can watch their demise
through the Gatekeeper's magic eye.

348
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:31,441
We've got to stop Boogey
from getting Horror's Hand.

349
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,381
Otherwise, he'll become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

350
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:37,249
I don't know,
I can imagine quite a bit.

351
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:45,725
It almost makes me smile.

352
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,158
I know what I'd do with
limitless power, yo.

353
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:58,233
I gots the best idea.

354
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,435
One candy bar, please!

355
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:06,377
Idiot. And you. Don't ever
have that thought bubble again.

356
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:09,682
I don't have to imagine
what I'd do with Horror's Hand.

357
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:13,085
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna use it to get me job back.

358
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,616
Well, no one is allowed to be
more powerful than me.

359
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,356
So we have to stop Boogey
and get Grim's powers back.

360
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:23,990
I'll enchant the boat
and we'll catch up in no time.

361
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,398
Now where's my scythe?

362
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:32,498
I've lost me scythe.
I love that scythe.

363
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,609
Great, maybe we can use you
for an anchor.

364
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,614
That's about all
you're good for now.

365
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:41,240
You two are the anchors.

366
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:43,979
Always draggin' me down,
holdin' me back.

367
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,886
My life was smooth sailin'
before you ruined it.

368
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,894
Is Grim gonna be OK?

369
00:30:56,932 --> 00:31:00,197
He'll be fine. He's going
through the 7 stages of grief.

370
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,896
Shock...

371
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:03,802
How could dis happen?!

372
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,828
Denial.

373
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:07,171
It's a mistake.
No way this could happen.

374
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,198
Bargaining.

375
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:11,974
It's OK. It's OK.
Maybe I can fix it.

376
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:13,003
Fear.

377
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:14,948
There ain't no way I can fix it.

378
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:15,972
Anger.

379
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:19,146
I'm gonna pull Boogey's nose off
and put it in a jar!

380
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:20,280
Despair.

381
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:24,725
And when I'm done with Boogey,
I'm coming for you, little pukes.

382
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,818
He's stuck on anger.

383
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:31,830
Anyone hungry?
Half-chewed zombie arms for everyone.

384
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,335
Well, I guess we do this
the old-fashioned way.

385
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,032
Everyone grab an arm and paddle.

386
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:55,754
Let me do the talking.
These are my people.

387
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,852
I.D., please.

388
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:00,760
I am the Grim Reaper, I need no I.D.

389
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:04,357
Sorry, citizens,
can't let you in without an I.D.

390
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,459
Well, it's really not a good picture.
Can't you just take my...

391
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:08,764
Show him the I.D.

392
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:15,868
Wait a minute. I don't got no eye.
I can't read this.

393
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:22,078
I'll have to summon
the Gatekeeper to perform... the test.

394
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:24,642
What's the test, Grim?

395
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:25,983
Well, how should I know?

396
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:27,989
Tests are scary, yo.

397
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,923
I feel like all those
Scantron dots...

398
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:34,088
are little eyes
staring back at me, touching me...

399
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:53,104
Behold! Me am Gatekeeper.

400
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:54,740
Bring greatest riddler.

401
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,454
- I think...
- No, you don't.

402
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:02,650
Well, I'm not very good
at riddles.

403
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,854
But I'm not good at
a lot of things right now. Am I?

404
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:08,419
You're getting pretty good
at getting on my nerves.

405
00:33:08,463 --> 00:33:12,797
Hey, yo, I know the question and answer
of every riddle known to man.

406
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:15,496
My level 52 troll warlock
is the only one ever...

407
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,165
to have opened the riddle door
of the math wizard.

408
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:21,107
Let me do this for the team, my pet.

409
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:23,043
Fine, great. Go away.

410
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:28,808
I am the best riddler here, yo.

411
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:36,321
Gatekeeper hate riddles.
Now me test you.

412
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:38,826
Let me look at him first.

413
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,895
Holy crud!

414
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:49,028
I never imagined that
the Grim Reaper would be so ugly.

415
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:52,234
I mean, he looks like a noseless
mother with bad shoes.

416
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:06,948
Good job, you passed the test.

417
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:18,457
This is what we get for
passing the test?

418
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,695
Seasoning.

419
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:30,139
Needs more cimmanon.

420
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:31,839
Hey, I'm starving.

421
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,246
Put more water on the fire,
mutton head.

422
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,908
You wait for cimmanon.
Cimmanon good.

423
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:46,383
Perfick.

424
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:49,159
Way too much cinnamon, yo.

425
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:51,294
Something bit me.

426
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:54,268
- Poisonous snakes!
- I don't think so.

427
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:59,597
If had me scythe
we'd be so out of here.

428
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:03,805
What are we going to do, yo?
Players don't get eaten by Cyclopses.

429
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:08,407
Yeah, I always thought
I'd be eaten by something cooler.

430
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,111
Like a biker gang.

431
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,448
Hey, One Eye, I think
your stew's gone bad.

432
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:19,685
Nope, secret ingredient cimmanon.
Not bad.

433
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:23,789
Did it just get warmer in here
or is it just me?

434
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:28,299
Billy, did you?
Oh, my goodness.

435
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,361
Did not!

436
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,532
OK, I did.

437
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,039
No!

438
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,621
Can't see! Need eye!

439
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:52,354
Not again! We're never going
to eat if you don't find it...

440
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,294
you big lump o' stupid!

441
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:19,479
It's like that little girl knows
how to use Billy as a weapon.

442
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:22,888
We need to stop those kids
before they beat us to the Hand.

443
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:25,950
Funny you should mention that.
I've been working on some designs...

444
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:28,258
For time-traveling robots
that could backtrack...

445
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:30,856
and eliminate
those meddlesome little nerds.

446
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:34,993
You work fast.

447
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:37,061
Wow! I totally do.

448
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:39,198
We are from the future.

449
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,971
Creeper built us to ensure
that the Lord of Horror...

450
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,979
reaches Horror's Hand
before Billy and Mandy.

451
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:47,311
We offer our services
as assassins...

452
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:49,544
or maids if you need cleaning.

453
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:50,573
Statement.

454
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,951
I am high.

455
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:58,425
I designed you to be unthinking,
unfeeling killing machines.

456
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,258
Billybot was damaged
on the surface world.

457
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,766
Damaged.

458
00:37:09,204 --> 00:37:12,640
Check behind that rock
in the front yard where the hide-a-key is.

459
00:37:12,674 --> 00:37:15,541
- Shut up.
- No! Check the refrigerator.

460
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:19,604
And while you're in there get me
a sandwich because this soup is terrible.

461
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:21,741
- Will you shut up?
- No, you shut up.

462
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,808
- No, you shut up.
- No, you shut up.

463
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:25,717
- No, you shut up.
- Shut up.

464
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,552
Any idea how our dinky raft
with the powerless Reaper...

465
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:34,994
can catch that enormous yacht?

466
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,595
Cake!

467
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:46,236
Doesn't this seem a little odd
to anyone?

468
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:49,903
Well, strawberry frosting is a little
unconventional on a chocolate cake.

469
00:37:49,945 --> 00:37:50,934
I mean...

470
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,776
Dude, you can kiss cake
in the mouth.

471
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,715
"Happy Birthday,
Billy and Mandy?"

472
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,618
It's probably a trap since
we don't share the same birthday.

473
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:02,623
Maybe it's celebrating
the show's birthday, yo.

474
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:05,387
We should probably leave it.

475
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:10,358
Frost-tastic!

476
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:13,990
This is good.

477
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:16,469
I can't say I've ever had
a cake quite this...

478
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,664
Good work, putting a sleeping potion
into the cake mix, Billybot.

479
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,168
Billybot?

480
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,727
Statement.

481
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:53,366
I am dreaming
that I am a caky marmoset.

482
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:01,738
Mission successful,
Captain Boogey Man.

483
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:05,514
The targets are neutralized
and ready for dream infiltration.

484
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,646
Excellent work, Mandroid.

485
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:11,785
Now, Creeper, it's time for
a good old-fashioned scaring.

486
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:18,997
Come on, you've got to laugh with me
or I look like a jerk.

487
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:31,334
I'm the world's
top cowboy astronaut!

488
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:34,178
Gotcha!

489
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,854
Way to go, Billy!

490
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:47,191
You're the best!

491
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:50,425
This is one of the most
shameful things I've ever seen.

492
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,524
What are you doing
in my dream, Mandy?

493
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:55,832
Reliving The Pit and the Pendulum
for the thousandth time.

494
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,531
What are both of you doing...

495
00:39:57,572 --> 00:40:00,006
in my recurring dream
about Puppy Town?

496
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:10,042
- And who are you?
- I'm the real Grim.

497
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:14,215
The guy you're riding only exists
in your sad, sick little dream.

498
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:17,616
I do this for one of my charities.

499
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:21,891
It's called
The Stupid Kids' Dream Foundation!

500
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:27,901
Well, if that's true...

501
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:30,063
where's the real Irwin?

502
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:33,472
Right here, yo.
I have this dream every night.

503
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,077
If you're here to scare us, skip it.
We're not in the mood.

504
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,546
Oh, yes, little Miss
"I'm always in control."

505
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:48,249
You're the reason I'm here.

506
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:50,314
You're the only threat to my plans!

507
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:53,585
You're coming with me!

508
00:40:56,998 --> 00:41:00,399
Let's see how you dupes do
without your brain trust.

509
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,597
I'll leave you with a gift.

510
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:08,865
That wasn't the gift. That was
this morning's three-cheese omelet.

511
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,138
Fear the gouda!

512
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:22,282
I wish I could wake up...

513
00:41:22,323 --> 00:41:25,292
but I don't usually
wake up until I pee!

514
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:28,295
Pee, yo, pee!

515
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:40,541
Mandy's been kidnapped by Boogey!

516
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,304
We have to get her back!

517
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:44,868
How will we get her back?
Boogey's got everything.

518
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:47,643
A better boat,
a full crew and Mandy!

519
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:50,651
Grim, if we're going
to get your powers back...

520
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:53,677
stop the Boogey Man,
and save the world from tyranny...

521
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,281
then we're going to need
all of us to do it!

522
00:41:56,324 --> 00:41:59,157
We have to get Mandy back!
Cake...

523
00:42:01,596 --> 00:42:05,965
There's one thing Boogey doesn't have.
The power of love!

524
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,761
What am I looking at?

525
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:13,103
It's the view from
the Gatekeeper's Eye, Captain.

526
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:15,268
But I thought Billy ate the eye.

527
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,039
He did.

528
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:19,103
You don't want
to think about it too hard.

529
00:42:19,147 --> 00:42:20,136
No matter.

530
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:23,480
Mandy, you admitted
in court under oath...

531
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:26,578
that Grim was no good to you
without his powers.

532
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:30,387
With Horror's Hand,
I'll be twice as powerful as Grim ever was.

533
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:32,359
If you were my friend...

534
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:34,884
and protected me
the way you protect Grim...

535
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:39,161
we could rule the universe together!
What do you say?

536
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,465
Just because I'll be best friends
with a loser bag of bones...

537
00:42:42,504 --> 00:42:45,439
doesn't mean I'll be best friends
with a toad like you.

538
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:47,805
Careful, little girl,
or I could make...

539
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:51,334
the rest of your miserable
little existence very scary.

540
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:53,973
Ain't that right, Creeper?

541
00:42:55,016 --> 00:42:56,278
What's that?

542
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:59,343
Yeah, scary!
Very scary, Captain. Yes.

543
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:02,554
Not scary at all...

544
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,424
Keep that up and the Employee
of the Month is going to be... that guy.

545
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,006
It's you who should
be scared, Boogey.

546
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:22,031
Why's that?

547
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:24,169
'Cause once
I get down from here...

548
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:26,703
I'm gonna kick
your slimy blue butt so hard...

549
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:28,375
you'll have to sit on your eyes!

550
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,407
Now, that's scary!

551
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:32,976
Maybe you could pick up
a couple of pointers from...

552
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:34,488
Enough!

553
00:43:34,522 --> 00:43:37,923
You're not kicking any butt, little girl.

554
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:40,894
If you think you are,
you're dreaming.

555
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:47,425
I just had the craziest dream.

556
00:43:57,946 --> 00:44:00,471
I just had the craziest dream.

557
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,483
Was it the one
where you can't save us?

558
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:04,644
Where are you, Mandy?

559
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:12,289
We can't make it without you, yo.

560
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:13,988
We're doomed.

561
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:18,431
Doomed! Doomed!

562
00:44:29,944 --> 00:44:33,038
Let me out of here!

563
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:38,844
She'll be under my sleep spell
until her will is broken.

564
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:41,582
Yeah, I remember
when you did that to me.

565
00:44:44,058 --> 00:44:45,184
I hate you.

566
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:55,894
It's just smooth sailing
from here on out.

567
00:44:57,137 --> 00:44:59,230
Sir, you might want to see this.

568
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,341
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

569
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,686
Mandy, I will find you
and save you, yo!

570
00:45:20,728 --> 00:45:23,026
What are you doing? Get him!

571
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:29,925
Yeah!

572
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,235
Hang on,
how did Irwin get so cool?

573
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:35,367
He's driven by the power of love.

574
00:45:35,409 --> 00:45:37,206
Really?

575
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:47,619
Love makes people do
all sorts of stupid tings.

576
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:50,123
I love everything.

577
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:51,715
Dat explains a lot.

578
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,380
Never send monster pirates
to do a robot's job.

579
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:17,884
Billybot, Mandroid, destroy!

580
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,051
She's still asleep!

581
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:27,151
Yes.

582
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:30,789
There is but one way to break the spell
this beautiful maiden is under.

583
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:58,457
OK, I get it.

584
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:02,826
Terrible, horrible, disgusting nightmares
that just keep getting worse.

585
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:05,127
Can we just move on already?

586
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:06,928
This is no nightmare, Mandy.

587
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:09,060
This is a dream come true.

588
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:15,833
I am the god of love!

589
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:19,409
When you're done there,
we've got a situation.

590
00:47:21,115 --> 00:47:24,482
Please surrender yourselves
and come with me.

591
00:47:24,518 --> 00:47:26,247
You will be assimilated.

592
00:47:26,286 --> 00:47:27,719
Please?

593
00:47:27,755 --> 00:47:30,588
Please?
If you're supposed to be me...

594
00:47:30,624 --> 00:47:32,319
then let's get
a couple of things straight.

595
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:34,020
I don't say please...

596
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,053
I don't assimilate,
and I don't take orders from anyone...

597
00:47:37,097 --> 00:47:39,657
especially your pathetic excuse
for a Boogey Man.

598
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,361
I, Mandy...

599
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:45,236
giving orders to Mandy,
who doesn't take orders...

600
00:47:45,272 --> 00:47:47,672
who gives order to me, Mandy...

601
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:52,407
who doesn't take...
010110...

602
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:53,811
Random...

603
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:05,086
Think fast before they figure out
they outnumber us.

604
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:07,685
I was just there
for the "saving you" part.

605
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:11,426
How fast do I have to think?
I'm getting dizzy.

606
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:12,762
We got you this far.

607
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,825
Not bad
for a weenie, a dope...

608
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:17,098
and a useless bag of bones
with no powers.

609
00:48:17,137 --> 00:48:18,434
You figure out the rest!

610
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:21,100
Am I the weenie
or the bag of bones?

611
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,617
That's so hot, yo.

612
00:48:35,656 --> 00:48:37,817
We can't let them get to the Hand first!

613
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:40,258
There's only one thing left to do.

614
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:42,990
Oh, sir! You can't mean?

615
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,227
I do! Release the Kracken!

616
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:05,842
You'd think
she'd be a little more grateful.

617
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,013
Where are we?

618
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:13,356
The Isle of Peril,
resting place of Horror's Hand.

619
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:41,315
It's amazing, yo.

620
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:42,686
I know!

621
00:49:42,723 --> 00:49:45,191
I can see
my grandma's house from here.

622
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:46,556
Shut up, Billy.

623
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:51,157
I'll never understand
why she moved here.

624
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:06,469
Halt!

625
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,319
- Who is that?
- I am Horror, the Ancient.

626
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:17,619
Long ago, I magically
channeled all of my fear into my left hand...

627
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:19,751
and then cut it off...

628
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:22,057
so I would forever be bold and brave.

629
00:50:22,095 --> 00:50:26,054
You may pass no further
without defeating me in a battle...

630
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:28,926
of wits.

631
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:32,370
During which I will attempt
to strike you with my spear.

632
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,066
Mr. Horror, Mr. Horror!

633
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:39,340
Did cutting off your hand
really make you brave?

634
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:41,108
Oh, my goodness, no!

635
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:43,582
I mean, what was I thinking?

636
00:50:43,617 --> 00:50:45,107
First of all, I'm a lefty...

637
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:47,814
so once I cut it off,
I couldn't even sign my name!

638
00:50:47,854 --> 00:50:51,085
Then I just got bored,
and I gained like 20 pounds.

639
00:50:51,124 --> 00:50:52,751
Now I do a lot of online gaming...

640
00:50:52,793 --> 00:50:55,261
and I've learned
to play a guitar with my teeth.

641
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,094
Gets kind of boring down here.

642
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:01,464
So what you're saying is...

643
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:03,969
you're not really
going to engage us in battle?

644
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:06,905
You just want a little love
and understanding.

645
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,307
Irwin's here
and he's ready to listen, yo.

646
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:13,741
If you defeat me...

647
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,408
you will face your greatest fear...

648
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,977
at the hand of Horror's Hand.

649
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,683
Well, looks like
we've gone from bad to worse.

650
00:51:35,168 --> 00:51:37,500
Billy!

651
00:51:37,537 --> 00:51:38,697
He'll be fine.

652
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:39,728
Oh, great!

653
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:43,004
There goes our comic relief. What next?

654
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:54,683
I'm afraid you're outmatched,
Grim old boy.

655
00:51:54,721 --> 00:51:57,918
Horror's Hand is mine.

656
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,426
If you want to be useful
without your powers...

657
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,223
now is a good time to start.

658
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:05,857
I... I don't know how, Boogey...

659
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,799
but we're going to beat you!

660
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,096
Smooth.

661
00:52:09,136 --> 00:52:11,366
Well, you can't both
have Horror's Hand!

662
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:13,771
You'll have to make
the Cannibal Run.

663
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:17,334
Whoever comes back alive
will win the honor of fighting me.

664
00:52:17,377 --> 00:52:20,107
Holy crud!
The Cannibal Run...

665
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:24,641
is the most dangerously frightening
section of the entire river.

666
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:27,848
- Well, we're not scared.
- We're not either!

667
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:30,686
Totally awesome!

668
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:33,124
You will start from Point Dread...

669
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,062
go through the Chasm of Blades
across the Bottomless Falls...

670
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:41,124
pass through the Hole of Oddities,
past Monster Island...

671
00:52:41,168 --> 00:52:43,966
through the Sunken City
of the Witch Queen...

672
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:46,564
stop for lunch
at the Picnic Grounds of Terror...

673
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:48,301
jump the Glacier of Evil...

674
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:50,400
pass the Whirlpool of Suffering...

675
00:52:50,444 --> 00:52:53,709
and, finally, overcome
the Cliffs of Crushing.

676
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:58,209
Man, I'm glad
I don't have to go through all that!

677
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:00,481
You have that all down, Grim old chum?

678
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,956
I'd hate to see you
and your delightful companions get lost...

679
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,390
or worse, along the way.

680
00:53:06,426 --> 00:53:09,759
See you at the finish line, Boogey!

681
00:53:09,796 --> 00:53:11,730
Our backsides perhaps.

682
00:53:16,937 --> 00:53:19,599
I miss Billy, yo.

683
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:22,107
I told you, Billy's fine.

684
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:27,379
He's been underwater
for six hours!

685
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:29,006
Billy's always fine.

686
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:31,381
We can't do this without him.

687
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:33,886
We need him!

688
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,880
You ladies lose your mascot?
That's a crying shame.

689
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,922
We don't need Billy anyway, right?

690
00:53:47,968 --> 00:53:50,801
We need to be together!

691
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:55,165
Billy's... always fine.

692
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:20,363
I'm fine!

693
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:30,935
First the Kracken ate me
but I kept alive by breathing my own farts.

694
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:35,277
Then me and the Kracken became friends.
He's really fun when you get to know him.

695
00:54:42,389 --> 00:54:44,323
Told you he was fine.

696
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:50,220
We might as well quit now.
There's no way we're going to win.

697
00:54:50,263 --> 00:54:53,994
The Cannibal Run is impossible.
No one's ever survived it!

698
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:55,797
- You can't quit.
- Why not?

699
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,531
Because I said so!

700
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:59,903
Don't treat me
like a three-year-old!

701
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,306
It was you kids
that got me powers taken away!

702
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:04,742
Boogey got your powers taken away.

703
00:55:04,778 --> 00:55:06,473
Because of you two!

704
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:09,505
Grim, when we won you
in that game of limbo...

705
00:55:09,549 --> 00:55:13,679
you agreed to be our best friend forever,
powers or no powers.

706
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,210
Don't remind me.

707
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:19,316
And best friends stick together
even through the tough times.

708
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,486
But this is
an impossible time!

709
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:23,359
You said that sometimes...

710
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:26,126
people do
stupid things out of love.

711
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,760
This is one of those stupid times!

712
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,269
But I don't love any of you!

713
00:55:31,304 --> 00:55:33,431
In fact, I pretty much hate all of you!

714
00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:35,566
And we feel the same way.

715
00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:38,601
But our only other option
is losing Horror's Hand to Boogey.

716
00:55:38,645 --> 00:55:40,272
Do you really want that?

717
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,244
I hate you guys.

718
00:55:44,284 --> 00:55:45,683
But I hate him even more!

719
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,778
Let's do this thing, yo!

720
00:55:52,158 --> 00:55:54,126
Go us!

721
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:13,207
And you're off!

722
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:17,479
Row, row, ye scurvy dog!

723
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:44,471
- I'm useless.
- Not yet.

724
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:46,308
Grab the back seat!

725
00:56:53,053 --> 00:56:54,350
We're neck and neck.

726
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:04,390
Incoming now!

727
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:12,097
- We're ahead.
- Oh, curses. No!

728
00:57:17,243 --> 00:57:18,369
I'll cut you.

729
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:21,107
We're gonna be the first into...

730
00:57:26,953 --> 00:57:29,080
...the Chasm of Blades.

731
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:30,647
What now?

732
00:57:31,691 --> 00:57:34,353
- We lose?
- What about all that stuff you said...

733
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:37,522
about friendship and trying
and never giving up?

734
00:57:37,564 --> 00:57:39,964
Yeah, sometimes
I just say stuff, you know?

735
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,137
Where do we get one of those?

736
00:57:57,417 --> 00:58:02,116
So, Grim, are you all cut up
about losing Horror's Hand?

737
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:05,556
Have I shredded any hope of victory?

738
00:58:05,592 --> 00:58:08,322
Are you falling apart at the seams?

739
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:11,228
I can almost handle
losing my powers forever...

740
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:14,529
if I didn't have to listen to this guy.

741
00:58:16,736 --> 00:58:19,603
Sorry, I'm allergic to blades.

742
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:22,870
Billy, hurry!
Sneeze on Mandy.

743
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:25,036
If you do that, I will...

744
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:36,114
Bring it on.

745
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,652
We're a river booger!

746
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:43,855
And you said you didn't need me.

747
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:46,798
Well, I hope
you kiddies can fly too...

748
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,030
'cause you're going to need to
to get over the Bottomless Falls.

749
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:54,665
Creeper, activate the rockets!

750
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,883
There's no way
we're getting over that pit.

751
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:11,880
Powers or no powers, we're not losing.
Quick, Mandy, me cloak.

752
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:15,361
Hang on to me cloak,
it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

753
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,558
Say goodbye to my butt!

754
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:28,036
Sayonara, suckers!

755
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,340
What's that, yo?

756
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:34,846
That would be the Hole of Oddities.

757
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:37,816
Why is it called
the Hole of Oddities?

758
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:39,318
We're about to find out.

759
00:59:43,123 --> 00:59:44,647
Oh, now I get it.

760
00:59:48,895 --> 00:59:51,762
I'm a forearm
from the waist down!

761
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:01,464
That was disturbing.

762
01:00:21,794 --> 01:00:23,523
My bottom!

763
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:24,962
Hot, hot, hot.

764
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:29,701
I don't even feel it anymore.

765
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,337
Sunken City of the Witch Queen.

766
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:43,675
I don't see no city.

767
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:06,864
I really gotta lay off
those cheese blintzes.

768
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:18,706
No. No!

769
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:21,705
Yeah!

770
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:30,752
Row!

771
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,527
These are moving too fast.
We'll never get through!

772
01:02:36,562 --> 01:02:38,553
We need more speed.

773
01:02:42,368 --> 01:02:46,236
Billybot, Mandroid,
destroy them!

774
01:02:46,272 --> 01:02:47,364
That's an order!

775
01:02:47,407 --> 01:02:48,999
Statement.

776
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:52,876
I don't take orders.

777
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:56,143
Especially from a pathetic excuse
for a Boogey Man like you.

778
01:03:15,968 --> 01:03:17,833
Suck cannonball!

779
01:03:20,173 --> 01:03:22,835
Yes! Yes! Yes!

780
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:35,319
- We win!
- Yeah!

781
01:03:36,356 --> 01:03:40,053
I'm the laughing stock
of the underworld.

782
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:49,691
Maybe scary really isn't your thing.

783
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:55,774
You are indeed fearless.

784
01:03:55,808 --> 01:03:59,175
Now the only thing
you must do is defeat...

785
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,211
Owned.

786
01:04:02,248 --> 01:04:05,046
All right, let's grab this thing
and blow this dump.

787
01:04:19,832 --> 01:04:23,996
Remember, Horror's Hand
is an artifact of unimaginable power.

788
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:26,334
But once we get close to it,
the hand will open...

789
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:28,567
and your worst nightmare
will spring forth.

790
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:32,271
It's only if you can overcome that fear,
that you get the hand.

791
01:04:32,311 --> 01:04:33,710
So let me go first because...

792
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,281
I ain't afraid of nothin'!

793
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:39,978
What about spiders, yo?

794
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:42,283
- And clowns?
- And the mailman.

795
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:00,805
Let's make you a pony, little boy.

796
01:05:08,848 --> 01:05:10,577
No one can help him now.

797
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,607
He must battle his own demons.

798
01:05:12,652 --> 01:05:14,119
Gosh, that's scary, yo.

799
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:17,213
Who's gonna go up there next
'cause it ain't gonna be...

800
01:05:19,692 --> 01:05:21,284
Oh, no!

801
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:23,295
Telling jokes to wild bears.

802
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:25,320
My worst nightmare!

803
01:05:29,368 --> 01:05:33,134
So a bear and a rabbit,
they're pooping in the woods and...

804
01:05:34,941 --> 01:05:36,465
Amateurs.

805
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:45,480
I'm looking for Horror's Hand.
Have you?

806
01:05:45,518 --> 01:05:46,951
Hello, me.

807
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:49,113
I remember being your age...

808
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,248
when I was all gloom and doom...

809
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,315
instead of sunshine and lollipops!

810
01:05:55,795 --> 01:05:59,959
But I was wrong.
I was wrong about a lot of things.

811
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,261
When I was your age...

812
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,464
I never told Billy and Grim
how important they really were to me.

813
01:06:05,505 --> 01:06:07,473
Oh, egad!

814
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:08,735
I don't...

815
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:12,039
Why don't you come in
and have some brownies?

816
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:14,205
You're not me.

817
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:17,114
You can't be me.
I'm supposed to do something important.

818
01:06:17,149 --> 01:06:20,880
Nothing is more important
than friendship.

819
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,445
Except maybe love.

820
01:06:24,924 --> 01:06:26,949
Hey, little lady.

821
01:06:26,993 --> 01:06:29,826
I see you met my wife, yo.

822
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:42,239
I told you,
you should have let me go first.

823
01:06:42,275 --> 01:06:43,640
The Hand won't affect me.

824
01:06:46,913 --> 01:06:48,972
I lived me worst nightmare
every day...

825
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:50,812
living with you two jerks!

826
01:06:58,019 --> 01:07:01,250
Hand over the Hand
or we'll handle you roughly!

827
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:20,970
And now,
Mr. Former Grim Reaper...

828
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:23,443
I think I'll take this opportunity...

829
01:07:23,478 --> 01:07:26,743
to scare you to pieces!

830
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,305
No, no, Boogey!

831
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:30,817
Not like this, not like this!

832
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:42,553
Mandy, this isn't fun anymore.

833
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:45,430
Billy, for once
I completely agree with you.

834
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:47,195
Yeah...

835
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:49,169
I wanna go home, yo.

836
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:50,670
Not so fast.

837
01:07:50,705 --> 01:07:55,074
I'm sure I've got room for you
in my slave army.

838
01:07:59,347 --> 01:08:00,541
I've done it!

839
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,175
I'm the scariest dude alive!

840
01:08:03,217 --> 01:08:06,345
Now, all that's left is to rule...

841
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:08,981
with an iron fist!

842
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:24,634
Hi there.

843
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:27,306
What?

844
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:28,774
Hang on a minute.

845
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,745
I scared you to pieces!

846
01:08:36,384 --> 01:08:37,578
No, really.

847
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:40,951
I scared you to pieces!

848
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:49,957
I totally blew meself up on purpose.

849
01:08:49,997 --> 01:08:53,194
You couldn't scare
a puzzle to pieces!

850
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:56,692
I... don't understand! I'm scary.

851
01:08:56,737 --> 01:08:57,999
The Hand!

852
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:01,634
It's making
my worst nightmare come true!

853
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:05,134
You've lost your edge, Boogey.
You're through!

854
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:10,048
Now that you mention it,
I don't know anyone un-scarier.

855
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:11,984
Creeper. No!

856
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:14,579
Wait, I'm supposed
to be afraid of that?

857
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:19,252
You're no spider clown mailman,
that's for sure!

858
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:22,421
You'd last two seconds with a bear.

859
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,595
I'm scary!

860
01:09:28,636 --> 01:09:30,729
I'll just be taking that!

861
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,873
No, seriously, I'm scary.

862
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:55,018
I'm scary.

863
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:02,065
I've failed!

864
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:51,975
What do you say?

865
01:11:04,465 --> 01:11:06,899
So the Boogey Man's
worst nightmare...

866
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:09,334
was realizing
that he's not scary at all.

867
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:13,170
That may have been his worst nightmare
but we can't blame the Hand.

868
01:11:13,207 --> 01:11:17,166
I turned it off,
right after I picked it up. See?

869
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:20,647
So he really wasn't ever scary at all!

870
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:21,841
Nice one, Grim.

871
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:25,978
Hang on a second.
This means I'm acting captain.

872
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:30,290
I'll be taking that Hand now.

873
01:11:34,295 --> 01:11:35,319
Nachos.

874
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:45,933
Work really burns me up.

875
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,143
Nice job.

876
01:11:51,178 --> 01:11:54,238
But Fred Fredburger
so didn't deserve that.

877
01:11:54,282 --> 01:11:56,307
Acceptable losses.

878
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:02,651
So you and me
can be friends now, right?

879
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,679
Suggestion.

880
01:12:06,227 --> 01:12:09,719
Assimilate! Assimilate!

881
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:13,398
So, who gets the Hand?

882
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:17,097
With its powers
I could be someone again!

883
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:22,007
And I could scare people
into thinking I'm smart.

884
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:26,275
I could use it to...
make someone love me, yo.

885
01:12:26,314 --> 01:12:29,078
- You'll never get it.
- It's mine!

886
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,243
Those nachos have hurt my tummy.

887
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:34,447
But if I had never eaten them...

888
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:36,922
I wouldn't have known
I could finish them all!

889
01:12:36,957 --> 01:12:39,425
What the heck
is he talking about?

890
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:40,984
Nachos!

891
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:43,053
Wait! He's onto something.

892
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:45,565
- Really?
- Yes!

893
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:48,727
This whole voyage
has been like eating nachos.

894
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:50,964
- Yes!
- If we'd never come...

895
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:54,964
we never would have known
how far we'd go to get what we wanted.

896
01:12:55,009 --> 01:12:56,636
- Nachos!
- And...

897
01:12:56,677 --> 01:13:01,580
we would have never seen
that we had what we wanted all along.

898
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:02,604
Yes!

899
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:06,313
Grim, you still saved the day...

900
01:13:06,354 --> 01:13:08,686
even without your powers.

901
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:13,250
Mandy still always gets her way.

902
01:13:15,696 --> 01:13:18,859
Irwin got to kiss his true love.

903
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,095
And I'm gonna get
a new bike for Christmas!

904
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:26,629
And we all did it
without Horror's Hand.

905
01:13:27,341 --> 01:13:29,536
And we did it together.

906
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:33,040
Now I am thirsty.

907
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,021
Did you come
to give me my job back?

908
01:13:48,062 --> 01:13:49,051
No.

909
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:52,623
We came to finish
what the Boogey Man started.

910
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:54,634
Banishing you forever!

911
01:13:57,838 --> 01:13:58,964
I don't think so.

912
01:13:59,006 --> 01:14:01,133
Bonehead here
just saved all your butts...

913
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:04,042
from a future ruled
by the Boogey Man.

914
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,248
So I think you're going to say thank you...

915
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:10,216
get his scythe
and give him his job back.

916
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:11,548
Now!

917
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:14,544
OK.

918
01:14:14,588 --> 01:14:16,988
Really?
I can be the Grim Reaper again?

919
01:14:17,024 --> 01:14:19,185
Sorry, girlfriend.

920
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:21,421
You're just not working out.

921
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,465
I missed you so much.

922
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:33,205
Who's your daddy?

923
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,506
I'll get you for this, Grim,
if it's the last thing I do!

924
01:14:41,515 --> 01:14:44,541
She was a heck of a reaper,
in her own way.

925
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:03,366
Stop right there!

926
01:15:03,404 --> 01:15:05,497
Don't give her the Hand.

927
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:06,972
- My eyes!
- What the?

928
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:11,000
I come from a time
two weeks in the future.

929
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:15,607
A future where
the Lord of Horror reigns supreme.

930
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:17,139
Her!

931
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:21,245
Two weeks sounds about right.
A girl's gotta have goals.

932
01:15:21,288 --> 01:15:23,222
It burns!

933
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:24,656
You look just like me!

934
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:29,629
But why are you naked?
Is it because clothes can't time-travel...

935
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,757
because nothing inorganic
can come through the time stream?

936
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,995
Nah, I just like to feel
the breeze on me.

937
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,332
Enough!

938
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,828
The Hand needs to stay
out of everyone's possession forever!

939
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:41,603
So I'm going to stow it in me trunk.

940
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:45,669
Yeah, because no one ever steals
anything from that trunk.

941
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:49,680
Suck eggs, Lord of Horror!

942
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,087
It's the Boogey Man!

943
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:57,522
Boogey Man? Where? Oh, no!

944
01:15:57,558 --> 01:16:00,618
Did I leave the oven on?
You guys gotta help me, I...

945
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,459
Boogey's afraid of everything!

946
01:16:04,498 --> 01:16:06,796
A few too many hits
on the noggin looks like.

947
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:09,597
A talking skeleton!

948
01:16:18,646 --> 01:16:20,011
Poor Boogey!

949
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:22,948
I don't know.
I think I prefer him this way.

950
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:36,355
Well, all's well that ends well.

951
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:38,456
Not that anything
ever really ends well.

952
01:16:38,499 --> 01:16:40,490
But I'm going to call this one a victory.

953
01:16:40,534 --> 01:16:43,332
And the time has come for me to go.

954
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:45,338
Goodbye, future Billy.

955
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:47,636
I hope we meet again someday.

956
01:16:47,675 --> 01:16:50,508
Can you tell me
what I'm having for lunch next Tuesday?

957
01:16:50,544 --> 01:16:54,105
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

958
01:16:58,485 --> 01:17:00,316
I like that guy.

959
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:03,812
You know, I couldn't have gotten
me job back without you kids.

960
01:17:03,857 --> 01:17:07,987
I mean, don't get to thinkin' I like you
or anything, 'cause clearly I don't.

961
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:10,189
If there's one thing
I learned down there...

962
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:13,097
it's that you shouldn't be
ashamed of your feelings, Grim.

963
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,534
- I have feelings too.
- You do?

964
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:22,272
Yeah. I'm feeling hungry.
Go whip us up some sandwiches!

965
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:26,939
I don't know
why I put up with you two.

966
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:28,846
Because we own you.

967
01:17:28,882 --> 01:17:30,679
Because you love us.

968
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:32,117
Yeah, yeah.

969
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,517
Wow, that was lame.

970
01:17:37,558 --> 01:17:40,527
I don't know why I put up with you two!

971
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:42,688
Because we own you.

972
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:46,723
Explanation.
Because you love us!

973
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:48,132
Yeah, yeah.

974
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,494
Temporal breach detected
in sector 33.

975
01:19:29,536 --> 01:19:31,902
Unit 7 moving in after him.
Over.

976
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:37,437
It can't be!
Nothing's changed.

977
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:39,343
Who could've stolen the Hand?

978
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:44,011
It's you! I should've known.

979
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:51,252
My worst nightmare
is that I've run out of nachos.

980
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,883
I like nachos.

981
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:55,957
I can spell nachos too.

982
01:19:55,996 --> 01:20:00,365
N-a-c-h-o-z.

983
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,697
Nachos! Yes!
