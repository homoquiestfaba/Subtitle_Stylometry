1
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:04,451
Joe, hello?

2
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:06,867
Joe, the door.

3
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,905
It's just another one
of those guys.

4
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,942
What guys?

5
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:15,047
Eh, guys working for
the big companies.

6
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,326
Want to buy the house,
rip it apart,

7
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,914
tear it down
like all the others.

8
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,883
Forcing good people out.

9
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,850
Goodbye, neighborhood.

10
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,438
Goodbye to your roses.

11
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,992
We can always
get more flowers.

12
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,994
That's not the point, Alice.

13
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,687
It's pure greed.

14
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,309
I'm in the business.

15
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,898
I see it from the inside.

16
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:39,451
We don't have to stay here.

17
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:42,040
We could sell up
and go live by the ocean,

18
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,904
like you've been
going on about forever.

19
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,320
The sound of waves--

20
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,736
wouldn't you like to hear that?

21
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,014
What I'd like to hear is
that pounding on my door stop.

22
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,775
I'm telling you,
they don't quit,

23
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,467
I'm gonna go get my gun
and clear up any confusion.

24
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,331
You stay away from
that old thing.

25
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,471
That's just gonna backfire,
and it's gonna hurt you

26
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,093
more than it hurts them.

27
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,957
At least put me
out of my misery.

28
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,547
Maybe you should
go talk to them?

29
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:09,136
Alice, it won't let up.

30
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, if you won't, I will.

31
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,829
Don't... don't you dare.

32
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:15,453
You do not go near that door.

33
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,351
-You're forbidding me?
-Don't you see?

34
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,146
They want,
they want one of us to break,

35
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,149
and they know it's usually
the wife that goes first.

36
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,840
Okay, you win.

37
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,980
Aces, champ.

38
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:28,949
Are you gonna at least water
my roses like you promised me?

39
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,916
In a minute.

40
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,886
I love you.

41
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,406
That's why I stick around.

42
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,481
A-Alice?

43
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:46,932
Alice?

44
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,831
Dad?

45
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,798
Dad?

46
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,044
Zoe.

47
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,977
Yeah.

48
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,910
Didn't you hear me out there?

49
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,637
-I've been pounding on the door.
-Yeah, of course I heard you,

50
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,571
but you ob-obviously,
you-you got your keys.

51
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:05,882
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

52
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,437
-I didn't hear it.
-Is it charged?

53
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:12,130
I don't know.
It's around here somewhere.

54
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,856
Right.

55
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,655
Hey, Zo, Zo, no, please,
please do not do that.

56
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,899
We need to let some air in here.

57
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,936
There's plenty of air.

58
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,145
Why are you wearing a sweater?

59
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,078
It's hot out.

60
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,080
Well, I'm comfortable.

61
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,088
Okay.
Dad, I'm officially worried.

62
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:41,815
Do you ever leave this room?

63
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,576
Are you eating?
Are you sleeping?

64
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,027
You'd be surprised
how little of both you need.

65
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,857
And, yes, I leave the room.
I go outside to water.

66
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:54,690
Did you call out for Mom
when I came in?

67
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,864
No.

68
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,661
No, of course not.
Don't be an idiot.

69
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,698
Dad, you're hurting.

70
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:06,080
I knew that expensive college
education would pay off one day.

71
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,082
You can't stay in here forever.

72
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:11,534
You need to let it go, grieve.

73
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,812
I grieve.

74
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:15,469
You waltz in here
every now and then,

75
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,955
you tell me how to dress,
you tell me what to eat.

76
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,268
Why don't you let go, huh?

77
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,615
Stop picking on me.

78
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,583
Okay.

79
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:36,145
Have you figured out what you're
gonna do with her ashes yet?

80
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,871
I got some ideas.

81
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,976
I'll let you know
when one of them feels right.

82
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,565
You can't let her
stay in there forever.

83
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,911
Why not?

84
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,913
If that's what I choose.

85
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:49,503
People-people hold on
to ashes all the time.

86
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,781
-She wouldn't want that.
-She's gone.

87
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:54,197
The dead are dead.

88
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,959
Whatever I do is for me.

89
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:00,652
And me.

90
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:04,104
Yeah.

91
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:07,245
Yes, and you. I'm-I'm sorry.

92
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,909
Zoe... I get it.

93
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,945
Don't worry.
I'll figure it out.

94
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,947
I just need time.

95
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,949
I wish you would
let Frank come by and do...

96
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,295
Don't, don't, don't.

97
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,298
Okay, if not him,
then someone, just...

98
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,646
I'm telling you, that man steps
one foot inside my door,

99
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,819
I-I don't know what Ill do.

100
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:32,995
You're gonna what?
You're gonna beat up our pastor?

101
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,275
I sat there out of respect
to your mother.

102
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,277
Every Sunday, I listened to him,

103
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,175
I listened to the guy
before him,

104
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,281
week after week, years of it.

105
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,663
Suit and tie, even when jeans
became okay in church.

106
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,527
Now I don't have to,
end of story.

107
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,151
Wow.

108
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,981
I was...

109
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,294
I was married to your mother
for 43 years,

110
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,192
eight months and 12 days.

111
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:00,091
Clock stopped ticking.

112
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:05,096
Wasn't my plan, but here we are,
and I do not need you and Frank

113
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,857
or anybody else tag-teaming
to tell me that I'm hurting.

114
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:11,067
I'm hurting, I know!
I'm hurting! I get it!

115
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:13,587
But I'll get over it, just like
I did with your brother.

116
00:09:13,622 --> 00:09:16,314
-I got over it.
-No, you haven't.

117
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,040
Well, you want,
I could start drinking.

118
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,386
How'd that work out for you?

119
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,146
Huh? Get you over the hump

120
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:25,219
when Danny bolted and left you
and Adam hanging? Huh?

121
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:27,256
I'm s-sorry. Zoe, I didn't
mean that, not like that.

122
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,913
I did not mean that.

123
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,604
-Yeah, you did.
-You're so--

124
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,606
Come on, Zo,
why are we doing this?

125
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,677
Is it--
Would you just come here?

126
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,921
I don't even recognize you.

127
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:39,026
I don't, Dad.

128
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,270
I'm confused by this.
I'm scared.

129
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,929
Well, don't be.
I'm working my way through it.

130
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:47,207
Would you-- how 'bout just come
and give me a hug? I need a hug.

131
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,967
You have people out there
depending on you.

132
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,625
And you have a guy out there
who's ready to sue you

133
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,868
because you left his house
half-finished

134
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,628
and his family is stuck
in a motel.

135
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:56,630
Jason and the guys
are gonna finish it.

136
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,253
It's just a couple of toilets,
a di-- I think it's a dishwasher

137
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,910
and, uh, we turn on the water!

138
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:02,429
That's what
I'm talking about, Dad.

139
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,431
Jason and the guys
quit two weeks ago

140
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,053
'cause they like to get paid!

141
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,261
Where are you?

142
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,711
Fine. I'll do it myself.

143
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:11,265
What moron cannot
connect a toilet?!

144
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,060
You know your bank called me
looking for you?

145
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,822
They did.
About your mortgage payments.

146
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,687
Give me a break!
My wife died!

147
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,724
And there is more of this
vomiting out of your mailbox.

148
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,968
I assume you've blown off
every bill you've received

149
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,210
in the last three months,
not to mention

150
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:26,487
the condolence cards
people have sent

151
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:29,283
-to show you they love you.
-So I missed my Hallmark moment.

152
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:31,009
You're...

153
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:33,667
Dad, this is
really freaking me out!

154
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:36,463
None of this is like you.
That's what worries me.

155
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,983
You did exactly
what I asked you not to.

156
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:41,295
-What?
-17 times.

157
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,435
What are you talking about?

158
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,922
He mentioned God by name
17 times in a 30-minute service.

159
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:49,165
You throw in every "Jesus this,"
"Jesus that,"

160
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,684
that's well over 30.

161
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,893
That's one mention a minute.

162
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,827
You actually counted?

163
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:58,243
I asked for one thing, Zoe,
one thing only.

164
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,349
"Please do not turn her service
into a religious thing."

165
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,800
She was Christian.

166
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:05,078
She's dead.

167
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,909
She's gone.
That day was for me.

168
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,325
It was also for me.
I am Christian.

169
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,948
I tell you what,
I'll make you a deal right now.

170
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,743
You stop jumping from
one fix to the next.

171
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:18,885
You start to believe that, I
tell you, you believe anything,

172
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,507
maybe I'll believe it, too.

173
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,096
-It had meaning for me.
-Meaning?

174
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,029
You want meaning?

175
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,203
Go out there and find out
who killed your mother.

176
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,826
Cops sure as heck
aren't doing it.

177
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,999
Three months, Zoe.

178
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,863
You find the scum
who ran her over

179
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,832
and left her in the street
lying there for dead!

180
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:35,833
No, I can't do this.

181
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,075
-Not today, Dad!
-That's right!

182
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,733
Fire gets hot, what does she do?
She runs off!

183
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:42,529
That's what sane people do
so they don't get burned!

184
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,187
If you don't want help,
that's fine.

185
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,292
Fine, Dad. But I am not
gonna go down with you.

186
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,467
I can't. I'm not going to.

187
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,227
Well, grab that little chain
around your neck, honey.

188
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,988
Keep on praying.
I hope it works for you.

189
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:55,059
You are such a...

190
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:58,096
I got to water the roses.

191
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,891
And get some air.

192
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,384
Hey.

193
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:55,386
Hey, wh-- shoo!

194
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,594
How'd...

195
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,185
How'd you get in here?

196
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,261
Shoo! Shoo!

197
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,952
Go!

198
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:12,575
I'm warning you.

199
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,440
Huh? I'm warning you.

200
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,408
You better get out of here.

201
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:20,618
Fine, have it your way.

202
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,429
Shoo.

203
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:05,214
Hey! Hey!

204
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:09,184
I'm not going anywhere!

205
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,082
What?

206
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,395
This house back here?!

207
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,155
This house, my house?!

208
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,570
Not for sale!

209
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,055
Whatever you say, boss.

210
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,402
I'm not your boss;
I'm your enemy!

211
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,615
Not for sale!
Not for sale!

212
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,444
Guy's a whack-job.

213
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,550
Stay out!

214
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,139
Ah, he's a nutcase.

215
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,563
How'd you get in here?

216
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,151
Hey. Hey!

217
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,669
Hey! How did you...

218
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:59,052
What, you think
I'm playing around here, huh?

219
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,605
Huh?

220
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:07,164
Huh?

221
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:13,687
Oh, now you're
making fun of me? Huh?

222
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,620
Go on. Come on.
Get out of here. Shoo.

223
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,277
Just get...

224
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:21,212
Come on, you ugly mutt, get--
Sh-Shoo.

225
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,697
Just get-get out of here.
I mean it.

226
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,665
Go!

227
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:29,600
Wrong.

228
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,119
Come on. Let's go.

229
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:32,741
Go! Go!

230
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,367
All right.

231
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,713
But I can tell you this,

232
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,612
the nights get pretty messy
around here.

233
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:43,200
It's when the ghosts come out.

234
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:46,065
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,242
Oh, you're a tough guy.

236
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:54,176
All right.

237
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,660
You've been warned.

238
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,535
Move it to the left.
Move it to the left.

239
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:17,510
Oh, thank you.

240
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,788
Ah.

241
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,425
Hold on. Hold-hold on.

242
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,634
Don't...

243
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:40,774
Don't you pee on my floor!

244
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,638
Here we go. Here we go.

245
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,124
Out you go. Come on. Come on.

246
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,785
Hey, hey!
No, not there, not there!

247
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,649
You get-get away from those!

248
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,444
Get away!

249
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,963
You don't ever go near these.

250
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,792
You got it? Ever.

251
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:00,518
You stay away.

252
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:03,625
Yeah, finish up
whatever you're doing there

253
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:04,798
and just get out of here.

254
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,354
Just go.

255
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:11,322
I got no business with you,
you got none with me.

256
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,675
Are you done?

257
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,609
All right. Go on.

258
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,759
What is with you?

259
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,857
Can you smell that?

260
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,997
Do you know what I have here?

261
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,551
I sure do.

262
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,072
Bring 'em on!

263
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:52,492
Just one!

264
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,361
That belly of yours
isn't getting any smaller.

265
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:01,501
You want me to eat just one,

266
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:03,331
but you tease me
with a plate full.

267
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,643
Where's the logic in that?

268
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:08,543
Restraint.
I'm teaching you restraint.

269
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,545
You got me
to restrain my language.

270
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,685
Doesn't that count
for something?

271
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,688
It does.
And I appreciate it.

272
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:19,450
Believe me, I got
a storage locker full of F-bombs

273
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,762
just busting to see
some daylight.

274
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:30,737
If I could take this
and squeeze it into a lifetime,

275
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,912
I'd die a happy man.

276
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:35,052
Fat and happy.

277
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,779
You know, I was just thinking
about that time up on the lake.

278
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,781
You know?

279
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,093
We were just down on that dock,

280
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:45,442
ah, just looking up
at that night sky,

281
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,720
the moon, the stars.

282
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:49,998
Yeah, wondering
where it all goes.

283
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:52,690
You and me, hmm?

284
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,694
Sitting there
in our own little world.

285
00:21:56,729 --> 00:22:01,112
Could've just reached
right up there, grabbed them,

286
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:03,839
the stars.

287
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:07,049
You remember that?

288
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:09,155
I do.

289
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:11,640
I fell in love with you
that night.

290
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,520
Is that where you are right now?

291
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,935
In the stars?

292
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,636
-What do you want?
-Hi.

293
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,189
Are you, uh, are you
the homeowner?

294
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:45,985
What do you think?

295
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,574
-Great.
-Oh, hey.

296
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:51,715
Hey, little guy, how are you?
Oh, you're friendly, aren't you?

297
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:53,406
Does he belong to you?

298
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:55,512
No. But you like him so much,

299
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:56,927
why don't you turn around
and take him with you?

300
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,031
I'm not interested.

301
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:03,451
Okay. Uh, well, I don't suppose
your wife's around?

302
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:05,038
Why would you ask that?

303
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:06,799
Oh, I'm sorry,
I just thought that I...

304
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,940
Hey, kid, I know
why you're here.

305
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,907
You see a "for sale" sign
out there?

306
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,184
Huh? I don't.

307
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,910
I do, however,
see a "no trespassing"

308
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,947
and "private property" sign,
and what part of that

309
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:18,673
gave you the bright idea
to come knocking on my door?

310
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:20,675
All right, I'm sorry.

311
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,918
Uh, obviously, y-you know,
you're not interested.

312
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:24,575
Yeah, I just told you that.

313
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,197
And there's no wife here
to cave in.

314
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,165
I know your tricks.

315
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,684
Cool.

316
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,168
I-I'm gone.
I'm sorry to bother you.

317
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,618
Yeah.

318
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,102
Take the dog.

319
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:36,587
Nope, I'm good.
Thank you, though.

320
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:47,805
What?

321
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,222
Oh. Hey!

322
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:52,879
Hey, hey, hey.

323
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,536
You know what?
That was bad.

324
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:56,055
That was way out of line.

325
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,126
Woke up on the wrong side of bed
this morning.

326
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,093
Come on back, let me hear
what you got to say.

327
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:01,957
Nah, man, I-I don't want
to bother you. It's...

328
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:03,683
You already did that.

329
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:06,755
You offering good money?
I could be interested.

330
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,240
Uh, we-we are--
we're competitive.

331
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,760
Well, competitive works for me.

332
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:14,176
Dog here thinks you're okay.

333
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,870
Come on back.
Let's hear what you got.

334
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:28,570
Yeah, hey, sorry about the mess.

335
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:31,953
My wife just died. Recently.

336
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:36,129
Oh, um, um, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry to hear that. I-I...

337
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,614
So what are you,
what are you gonna do?

338
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:40,858
Just buy it, tear it down?
Is that your plan?

339
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,861
Uh, listen, uh, you know,
maybe-maybe this isn't

340
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:46,070
-the best time right now.
-No, no, no.

341
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:47,520
Oh, actually,
it's a perfect time.

342
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:49,833
Come on. Close the door. Sit.

343
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:51,490
Sit!

344
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:10,267
So what do you got?

345
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,582
Oh, uh, right.
Um...

346
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:20,173
Ah, hey. Look at that.

347
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,141
Ah, let's see what you got here.

348
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:26,628
What do you have here?

349
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:29,010
Norman Olsen.

350
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,944
Ah, Norman.

351
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:34,049
You don't hear that name
a lot anymore.

352
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:35,050
Yeah.

353
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:38,191
You look more like a Chad to me.

354
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,297
Huh.

355
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,989
So, Chad, what kind of numbers
are we looking at here, huh?

356
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,163
For my place.

357
00:25:44,197 --> 00:25:45,820
Now, I know
it's just land to you,

358
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,891
but it means a lot more to me.

359
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,168
Uh, yeah. No, right.

360
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:51,584
Um, well, I-I suppose I should--

361
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,344
well, I have to ask you
a few questions first.

362
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,795
-Sure.
-Um...

363
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,696
Uh, do you, do you own the house

364
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,594
or-or do you have a,
do you have a mortgage?

365
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,976
What difference does that make?
I know what I owe.

366
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,668
You tell me what I get from you,
I do the math.

367
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:08,118
All right.
All right, yeah.

368
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,085
All right, I got ya.
Yeah, okay.

369
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,019
Uh, all right, next,
um, uh, let's see.

370
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,780
Are there any liens
on the house?

371
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,644
-Nope.
-No.

372
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,646
Uh, any other names
on the title?

373
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,993
No, just me.
My wife is gone now.

374
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,101
Yeah, right. Um...

375
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:28,897
Yeah, and again,
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

376
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:34,247
Uh, okay, uh, what about
the-the lot, square footage?

377
00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:35,939
Say just approximately.

378
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:40,668
7,227 square feet,
11 and 3/4 inches.

379
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:42,393
Let's round it off to 28.

380
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:44,257
Wow.

381
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,121
Uh, that's-- Okay.

382
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,263
-All right, look, kid.
-Hmm?

383
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:52,127
Just give me your number.

384
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:53,853
Your slick brochure,
your fancy shirt

385
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:57,374
with your muscles popping
out of it, doesn't impress me.

386
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,653
Life is all about
the numbers, right?

387
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:02,448
Yeah.

388
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:04,692
You're right. Yeah, yeah.
No, I got you. I got you.

389
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:06,935
-Yeah.
-Yeah, all right, but, um,

390
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,213
-I got to do some crunching.
-Yeah. You go ahead.

391
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,732
Coffee just kicked in.

392
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,079
Got to do
a little crunching myself.

393
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,944
Well, uh,
take your time.

394
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,706
Um, I'll just hang out
here with, uh--

395
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,225
-Wh-What's your dogs name?
-Uh...

396
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,710
Dog.

397
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,680
That-that's his name?

398
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,026
Yeah, why not?

399
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:31,857
After all, a name is
just a name, right?

400
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:35,032
In reality, we are who we are,
right, Norman? Chad?

401
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:37,034
Norman? Chad-Norman-Chad?

402
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,486
Um, Dog's fine.

403
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,453
Give me that number, Norman.

404
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:20,422
Love of my life.

405
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:22,148
I'm sure that...

406
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:26,083
Then bang, just like that,
she's gone.

407
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:29,466
Three months, seven days, and--
what do you know?--

408
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,261
just a couple hours ago.

409
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:33,263
Hmm.

410
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:37,439
And now here we are,
here you are, to take my home.

411
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:38,302
I-I what?

412
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,511
Is that just a coincidence,
Norman?

413
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,169
Uh, I don't, I don't understand.

414
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,137
No.

415
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:47,139
Yeah, I don't think you do.

416
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,284
Please.
I-I've got a kid, all right?

417
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,768
Me, too.

418
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:58,495
Little girl in those photos?

419
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,324
She used to have a mother.

420
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,119
Yeah, kids lose their parents
all the time

421
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,811
to life's unfortunate events,

422
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:08,367
and sometimes, well,
parents even lose their kids.

423
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,577
I-I think that you might have me
mixed up with somebody else.

424
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:14,269
Did you or did you not come here

425
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:17,376
with the sole purpose
to take this house, my home?

426
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,240
I mean, yes, I did.
I mean, but sort of.

427
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:21,345
Conveniently available,
sort of, don't you think?

428
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,314
-Now with my wife gone.
-I-I don't underst...

429
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,143
-You kill her?
-What?

430
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,490
Did you kill my wife?

431
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,527
Look, I-I have no idea what
you're talking about right now.

432
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:33,116
Oh, I think you do,
you or the people you work for.

433
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,153
You killed her, you made it
look like an accident.

434
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:38,811
We know what happened.
Don't we?

435
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,850
And why.

436
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,300
Please, sir.

437
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,613
-Please what?
-Please, please don't-don't do

438
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,615
whatever it is that you're
thinking about doing right now.

439
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:51,997
What is it you think
I'm thinking about doing?

440
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:54,378
Uh, I-- look, all I did was
I just came here to see

441
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,104
if you wanted to sell
your house, that's it.

442
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:57,450
Oh, fair enough.

443
00:29:57,485 --> 00:29:59,004
So what do you think now?

444
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,972
You think I want
to sell my house, Norman?

445
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,491
No, probably not.

446
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,424
Your-your wife just passed away.

447
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,529
She didn't just pass away.

448
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:09,290
She was killed.

449
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,261
So what do you think, Dog?

450
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,125
Should we just finish this guy?

451
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,507
Finish him
and be done with it, hmm?

452
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,238
Hmm?

453
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:28,067
What?

454
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,588
What-what is he,
what is he saying?

455
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,590
I don't know.
You speak dog?

456
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,282
You tell me.

457
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:38,457
Um, I-I think that he's,
I think he said that you should

458
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:41,046
let me go and that I'll forget
that this ever happened

459
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,152
and I will never, ever, ever
bother you ever again.

460
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:46,672
Is that right?

461
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:48,881
We should just let him go, hmm?

462
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,574
Really?

463
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,924
I think maybe you're right.

464
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,617
I think he also said, I find out

465
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,308
that you or the people
you work for,

466
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:04,069
you killed my wife,
you killed my Alice,

467
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:07,244
I will not hesitate
to shoot you on sight.

468
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,316
You let them know I'm onto you.

469
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,629
The whole thing.

470
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,183
Uh, yeah, fair-fair enough.

471
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:19,015
This will not be forgotten.
I don't forgive and forget.

472
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:21,983
I-I hear you.
I hear you loud and clear.

473
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,608
All right, go on.

474
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:29,128
Go on.

475
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:31,096
Take your little brochure.

476
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:43,073
Hey, you never gave me
that number.

477
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:46,318
What this place might be worth.

478
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:49,217
Uh, I'm really sorry
about your wife.

479
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:50,909
Good answer.

480
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:59,400
That might be the
dumbest thing you've ever done.

481
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,333
Not now, Alice.

482
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,680
-Consequences.
-The air had to be cleared.

483
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,993
A message had to be sent.

484
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,029
And this is how you do it?

485
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:10,342
Yes, this is how I do it.

486
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:12,171
And where has that gotten you?

487
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:15,036
Here. Right here.
My house. My home.

488
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:17,659
My little piece of it all that
they can't get their hands on!

489
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:19,592
Mine!

490
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:22,526
I'm telling you, Alice, they
take everything if you let them.

491
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:25,736
You got to fight back.
You got to send a message!

492
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:28,463
If you say so.

493
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:36,161
You're being hard on Zoe.

494
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:42,684
She's hurting and she needs you.

495
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,617
-She looks up to you.
-I know.

496
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:47,413
She loves you.

497
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:49,795
I know.

498
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:52,729
I'll... I-Ill patch things up.

499
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,732
And get rid of that gun.

500
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,078
Promise me.

501
00:32:57,113 --> 00:33:00,530
I promise. I promise.

502
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,406
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But what's done is done.

503
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,408
At least they know
to leave me alone now,

504
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:18,375
give me five minutes of peace.

505
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,313
Come on, guys.

506
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,808
All right.

507
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:39,776
Watch your head.

508
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:48,612
Thank you.
Hey. I'm sorry.

509
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:50,338
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

510
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:52,513
It's-its just
a big misunderstanding.

511
00:33:54,308 --> 00:33:56,827
-Thanks for coming in, Miss...?
-Bigler.

512
00:33:56,862 --> 00:34:00,176
- It's her maiden name, my name.
- Zoe.

513
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,695
-Zoe's fine.
-She was married, but her deadbeat husband ran off

514
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,112
-on her and their kid on his fifth birthday.
-Okay.

515
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:07,286
-Actual day. What a world, right?
-Okay, Dad.

516
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:08,667
It is.

517
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:10,565
All right, Zoe.
Um, I'm Detective Rollins.

518
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,464
If you don't mind, Id like
to jump right into this.

519
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:13,879
Yeah, that's fine.

520
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:17,089
Does your father own a gun?

521
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,091
N-No, not that I'm aware of.

522
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:20,713
-Dad?
-Of course I don't.

523
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:22,508
You know how your mother felt
about guns.

524
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:24,579
-This is absurd.
-Mm.

525
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:25,615
Well, I've got
a signed affidavit here

526
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,513
as part of a complaint
that he pulled a gun out

527
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:30,827
on a Norman Olsen, who had
visited his house earlier today.

528
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,484
I'm sorry, who?

529
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:34,175
Another guy trying
to buy the house.

530
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,728
I'm telling you, Zo,
they won't let up.

531
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:38,317
-Sorry, you had a gun?
-No. No.

532
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,319
That's what I've been
trying to tell them.

533
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:41,734
I don't own a gun.

534
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,151
This guy, this Norman kid,
he's making it all up.

535
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:46,394
It's-its just another trick
to get me out.

536
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,500
First your mother, now this.

537
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:50,433
Okay, let's not do that in here.

538
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:52,642
Wait, what do you mean,
trick to get you out?

539
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:56,715
My dad thinks somebody
wants his house for the land.

540
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:57,716
'Cause its an older home...

541
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,236
-It's strong and sturdy.
-Like you, right?

542
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,101
Neither of us are
going anywhere soon.

543
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:06,897
My mother had an accident
recently on her bike...

544
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:09,555
No. No, no, no.
She was murdered.

545
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,316
-Now I know why.
-Dad...

546
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,318
She was.

547
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:15,734
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

548
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:19,151
Because nobody around here seems
to be doing anything about it.

549
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,740
I-I told the cops
who came around after.

550
00:35:21,774 --> 00:35:24,467
It was no accident.

551
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:25,916
Uh, she was killed.

552
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:27,918
To try to get me to cave in,

553
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:31,612
get all emotional
and just move out.

554
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:33,476
And you think
this Norman Olsen

555
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,823
-had something to do with it?
-Him, somebody he works for.

556
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:38,170
It's all one big circle.
They're all in it together,

557
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,172
buying up the world,
turning it into something

558
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,210
that I couldn't recognize
to save my life.

559
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:45,660
And that's why
you pulled out a gun on him?

560
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:48,836
What part of "I don't own a gun"
do you not understand?

561
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,458
-And don't you try to trick me.
-Dad...

562
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,288
No. No.
I've done nothing wrong.

563
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:53,806
It's my word against
this Norman kid.

564
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,429
Search me.
Search my house.

565
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:57,707
No gun, period.
It's all made up.

566
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:01,814
So you mean we can do that?
Search your house?

567
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:03,644
Yeah. Sure.

568
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:05,646
Here, go ahead. Here, I got...

569
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,235
Knock yourself out.

570
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:24,251
How's Adam?

571
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,563
-He's fine. He misses you.
-Thanks.

572
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:29,290
I miss him, too.

573
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:33,398
Maybe you could
bring him around.

574
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,954
Not now.

575
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,853
Just tell him
I was thinking about him.

576
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,821
I will.

577
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,548
Hey, did I tell you
I got a little dog?

578
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:48,033
-What?
-Just showed up one day. Won't leave me alone.

579
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,518
Uh, won't leave, period.

580
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:54,246
Did you try
to find his owner?

581
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,351
Adam's gonna love him.

582
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:57,249
Dog-- that's what
I'm calling him.

583
00:36:57,284 --> 00:37:00,701
-That's creative.
-It works.

584
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:07,397
Dad... I'm serious.

585
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:09,399
When we get through this,
I really need you

586
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:10,918
to talk to someone.

587
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:13,058
To anybody.

588
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:16,061
I don't know what to do.

589
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:18,753
I'm scared. I don't know
what's going on with you.

590
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:22,343
You understand that?

591
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:26,451
Okay. I-I need somebody
to help me understand this.

592
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:28,591
I-I get it, Zo.

593
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,800
Make it happen.
I'll be there.

594
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,768
I promise. Whoever.

595
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:35,045
Thank you.

596
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:39,360
-Yeah, sure, thanks.
-We'll get this all straightened out.

597
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:41,880
I just want it to be done.

598
00:37:41,914 --> 00:37:43,882
-Hey, how you doing, Norman?
-Dad, stop...

599
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,644
I'm-I'm sorry about
any misunderstanding.

600
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,510
Mr. Bigler?

601
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,756
So?

602
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,102
He's dropping the charges.

603
00:37:57,136 --> 00:38:00,519
Oh, he changed his tune, did he?
That was quick.

604
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:02,935
So this ends here, unless
you give me a reason otherwise.

605
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,386
So let's keep it in check, okay?

606
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,492
Don't let me regret
letting you off the hook

607
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,527
for whatever happened today.

608
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:11,496
He won't.

609
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,636
Mr. Bigler?

610
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,672
What part of the...

611
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:20,298
You got my word.
I won't be a problem.

612
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,682
Promise me.

613
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:28,789
Swear to me
you don't have a gun.

614
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:31,481
I already got rid of it.
It's not gonna be a problem.

615
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,759
Oh, my...

616
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,455
I want you
to talk with Frank.

617
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,870
Here it goes.

618
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,699
You just said I make it happen,
you'll be there.

619
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:44,701
-You said whoever.
-To talk to somebody,

620
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,910
work my way through this,
not get the magic wand of God

621
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:49,361
waved over me and try
to turn me into something

622
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,674
I'm never gonna become, Zoe.

623
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,641
He's a good listener,
that's all.

624
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:59,923
I talk to Frank,
that makes you happy?

625
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,548
This is so far beyond
what makes me happy.

626
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:04,790
Fine.

627
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,999
Fine. Bring him over.
No big deal.

628
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:08,725
We'll clear the air.

629
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,417
I promise.

630
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:14,697
I... I'll talk,
he listens, we make peace.

631
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:19,633
After that,
maybe I can see Adam?

632
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,432
Get him and Dog together.
That would make me happy.

633
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:29,125
You have a deal.

634
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:41,171
What? What?

635
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:43,588
What? Quit it.

636
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:45,555
Huh? What?

637
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,975
What?

638
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,130
You see that?

639
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,132
I told you, they don't give up.

640
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:12,996
And now they got me
right where they want me.

641
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,896
I can't even defend myself.

642
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,933
Oh, now I got you to take care
of me, is that right?

643
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,972
You might want to brush up

644
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,008
on that bark of yours
I've never heard.

645
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:40,714
Yeah, sure. Why not?

646
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,894
Over here, over here!

647
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,210
Yeah, come on through.

648
00:40:58,145 --> 00:41:00,250
How come I never
hear you bark, anyway?

649
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:02,114
You do know how to bark,
don't you?

650
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:04,703
You're a dog.
That's how dogs talk. They bark.

651
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:07,637
"How you doing today, Mr. Dog?"

652
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:10,744
"Oh, that's nice to hear."

653
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:12,124
"How are the wife and kids?"

654
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,852
"Oh, that's good."

655
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:21,168
"Oh, it's very nice of you
to ask. I'm doing just fine."

656
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:26,932
Hey. What are you looking at?

657
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,798
H-Hey, get back! Get back!

658
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:34,181
You better be finished
with your business.

659
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:35,872
What did I tell you?

660
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:38,081
Here I am, I give you
some slack, I make friendly,

661
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:39,289
and suddenly you turn on me?

662
00:41:39,324 --> 00:41:42,051
Ah, so now you're
a smart guy, huh?

663
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,260
All right.

664
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,882
Is that it?

665
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,988
Is that what you're
looking for, Columbo?

666
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,611
Bad dog! Bad dog.

667
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:52,579
Dad?

668
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,032
You do not go near that,
do you understand?

669
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:59,620
-You stay-- Hey, Dog.
-Dad?

670
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:01,588
You do not go near it.
You do not go near it.

671
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,590
Do you understand me?

672
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:06,006
Dad?

673
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,285
Hey. I thought I heard you.

674
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,081
-Dad.
-I was just about to water the flowers.

675
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,911
Oh. Is this him?

676
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,257
Is this the dog you found?

677
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:18,812
Oh, more like he found me.

678
00:42:18,846 --> 00:42:21,159
Aw, come here. You're cute.

679
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:22,712
He thinks you say that
to all the dogs.

680
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:24,611
Ha. Not true.

681
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,717
But you could definitely
use a bath.

682
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:29,719
I don't think
he likes water too much.

683
00:42:29,754 --> 00:42:31,790
I tried to hose him down
once, but...

684
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:35,207
So you haven't seen
any signs for lost dogs?

685
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:36,761
-No one's come around?
-Nope.

686
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:39,315
-Oh. Well, you can't keep him.
-Why not?

687
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,213
'Cause he belongs to somebody.

688
00:42:41,248 --> 00:42:43,975
He has no collar, no leash,
no tags, no nothing.

689
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:46,978
He shows up at my door; nobody's
come around looking for him.

690
00:42:47,012 --> 00:42:48,980
What am I supposed to do?

691
00:42:49,014 --> 00:42:51,707
I take him to the pound,
you know what they're gonna do.

692
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:53,225
Yeah.

693
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,296
-Well, Frank's inside.
-Oh.

694
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:57,747
Right.

695
00:42:57,782 --> 00:43:00,025
Well, that was quick.

696
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,372
-You promised.
-I did.

697
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:06,307
Let's do this.

698
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:08,931
-Be nice.
-Nothing but.

699
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:15,040
I just want to say
right off the bat

700
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:17,733
that I-I'm sorry
about the service.

701
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,735
I heard from Zoe
that you were disappointed.

702
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,426
And my walking out
in the middle of it

703
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,358
didn't send that message, huh?

704
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,084
Oh, it did, it did.

705
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:25,430
And, uh, again, I'm sorry.

706
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:29,261
I was trying to find a balance
between what you'd asked for

707
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:31,678
and the expectation of others,
Alice's friends.

708
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:34,750
Okay. Fine.

709
00:43:34,784 --> 00:43:36,165
Let's move on.

710
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:38,305
Sure.

711
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,307
Still, you must know
that Alice had

712
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:41,998
deep feelings
regarding her faith.

713
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:47,728
Look, Alice had faith;
I had doubt.

714
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,696
You'd be surprised
how well the two work together.

715
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,007
Doesn't surprise me at all.

716
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,700
I think that doubt's
an important part

717
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:55,287
of a healthy faith.

718
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:56,841
Tell you what.

719
00:43:56,875 --> 00:44:00,189
Let's put all the
religious stuff aside for now.

720
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:01,742
Would it surprise you
to know that

721
00:44:01,777 --> 00:44:03,157
Alice was concerned about you?

722
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,299
Well, I, uh...

723
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:10,095
Oh, that's news to me.

724
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,410
Well, she and Zoe...
care about you.

725
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,446
Frank, can you--

726
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:18,828
Frank, can you do me a favor?

727
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:21,417
Stop talking like
she's still here.

728
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:27,043
Yeah. Sure. I'm sorry.

729
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,011
You know, for a guy who's here
to do some listening,

730
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,427
you're starting to do
a lot of the talking.

731
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,325
Okay. You're right.

732
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,396
Tell you what.

733
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:37,157
Just tell me how you're doing.

734
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:40,194
Oh. Okay, let's see.

735
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:42,852
Um, like I said, I'm-I'm good.

736
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:45,959
I'm-- No, really, I am.
I-I even told Zoe this.

737
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:47,857
I know it may not look that way,

738
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:50,791
but I'm working
my way through it.

739
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:52,344
It just takes time.

740
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:53,449
Frank, uh, come on.

741
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,038
You must deal with
this grief stuff all the time.

742
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:58,143
I do.

743
00:44:58,178 --> 00:44:59,938
Oh.

744
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:01,353
We're good, then.

745
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,528
-We done here?
-Dad.

746
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:04,563
Well, Frank gets it.

747
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:06,773
He knows, it's just
gonna take some time.

748
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:08,222
It-It's nothing more.

749
00:45:08,257 --> 00:45:10,052
Right, but there's plenty
to talk about still.

750
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:13,227
Look, if you're waiting for me
to fall on the floor

751
00:45:13,262 --> 00:45:16,023
in a heap of snot
and cry out to Jesus to save me,

752
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:17,956
it's not gonna happen, honey.

753
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:20,821
-That's not why I'm here.
-Forgive me, Frank, but...

754
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,340
give me a break.

755
00:45:22,374 --> 00:45:24,238
Hey.

756
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:27,517
You know it, and I know it.

757
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,416
All right, look.

758
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,970
Yes, Alice had her beliefs,
and I supported her.

759
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:33,800
But it doesn't mean
it works that way for everyone.

760
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,009
And it certainly
doesn't work that way for me.

761
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:40,185
And frankly, Frank...

762
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,119
I don't think she was
as concerned about me

763
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:44,465
as you make it sound.

764
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,398
That was a low blow.

765
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:49,125
Okay.

766
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,577
But if I may,
what does work for you?

767
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:55,338
You say you're getting over
Alice's death.

768
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:57,168
How?

769
00:45:57,202 --> 00:46:00,378
I just take things as they come.
I deal with them when they do.

770
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:03,795
If nothing else,
I learned that in the ring.

771
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:07,143
Tomorrow's always another round.
I always counted on that.

772
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,147
You know, Joe,

773
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:14,047
I think we have more in common
than you might think.

774
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:15,358
Oh, yeah?

775
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:21,295
How so?

776
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,815
Take love, for example.

777
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,437
You know love, right?

778
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:27,957
I know that you loved
Alice deeply.

779
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:31,996
And faith,
you may call it hope,

780
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:35,102
that strange force
that drew you into the ring

781
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:37,864
when every part of your body's
telling you to stay out.

782
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:40,211
And mercy.

783
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:42,420
Compassion.

784
00:46:42,454 --> 00:46:44,525
I saw it every Sunday
when you took a seat

785
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,527
next to Alice in church.

786
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:49,323
Even if you were just
going through the motions,

787
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:51,118
you were there for her.

788
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:55,019
Do you recognize
any of those things?

789
00:46:55,053 --> 00:46:56,952
Yeah, of course.

790
00:46:56,986 --> 00:46:59,264
I'm human.

791
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,991
See? We're not so different
after all.

792
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:04,856
God just uses each one of us
in His own way.

793
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:07,445
You see that, Zo?

794
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:09,171
See what he did just there?

795
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,349
He snuck God right in
through the back door.

796
00:47:15,384 --> 00:47:18,076
All right, my turn.

797
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:25,428
Two times in my life
I tried to reach out to God.

798
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,327
And, I mean
give it my best shot,

799
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:30,123
despite every part
of my being saying don't.

800
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:32,504
And you got to understand,
this was because of Alice.

801
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:34,575
Not for her, but because of her.

802
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,578
Uh, I mean, if God and all that
meant so much to her,

803
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:41,237
there must be something to it,
something I must be missing.

804
00:47:41,272 --> 00:47:42,894
I loved her that much.

805
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:46,139
I trusted her that much.

806
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:48,072
And I respected her.

807
00:47:50,177 --> 00:47:53,008
First time, I'm at work one day.

808
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:56,183
I get a call out of nowhere,
out of the blue, that,

809
00:47:56,218 --> 00:48:00,325
"Your son is lying in a hospital
bed and he's dying." What?

810
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,570
Anyway, I get over there,
to the hospital

811
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,641
where they got him, and...

812
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:09,956
I see Alice and I see
a fear in her eyes

813
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,268
like nothing
I've ever seen before.

814
00:48:15,444 --> 00:48:18,274
So I-I figure I-I guess
I should pick up the slack.

815
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:23,659
I-I should say a prayer that she
can't seem to manage just then.

816
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,973
So I, um...

817
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,560
I beg Him.

818
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:31,736
I beg God...

819
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,946
"Please, don't take my son."

820
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:37,052
Hmm? I prayed...

821
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:41,056
...and I prayed.

822
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:45,129
And I waited. And I waited.

823
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:49,512
I begged for mercy.

824
00:48:49,547 --> 00:48:52,412
I begged...

825
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,345
for compassion.

826
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:00,316
We all know how that turned out.

827
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:03,354
One day short
of you guys turning 13.

828
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,255
He didn't even have a chance
to be a man.

829
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:13,191
Second time,

830
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:16,263
three months ago,

831
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:19,611
I'm sitting in this room,
right in this chair right here,

832
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,613
and suddenly
there's a knock at the door.

833
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:24,582
There's a cop. He tells me
there's been an accident.

834
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:27,309
I heard sirens. I didn't think
anything of it, but...

835
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:29,621
Anyway, he goes on to tell me,
um, "I'm sorry, sir,

836
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:31,416
but your wife has
fallen off her bike."

837
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:34,592
Just like that,
"Fallen off her bike."

838
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:37,008
So, uh, I rush over
to the hospital--

839
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:39,079
same hospital where Mike died--

840
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:42,048
and they tell me,
"It doesn't look good."

841
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,050
What is going on here?
"It doesn't look good"?

842
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,569
What is this, a television show?

843
00:49:46,604 --> 00:49:50,711
Anyway, they...
they take me into the E.R.

844
00:49:50,746 --> 00:49:53,197
They pull back this curtain

845
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:56,648
where they got her
hid from view,

846
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:58,616
and then there she is.

847
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:03,448
Just cut to pieces.

848
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:05,450
Mangled.

849
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:08,246
A mess.

850
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:12,664
43 years by her side,
all that beauty, all that love,

851
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:14,632
and then there she is,
like that.

852
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:21,742
And the only thing-- our entire
future and our entire history,

853
00:50:21,777 --> 00:50:25,298
the only thing we got left
is the faint beep

854
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:27,300
of this little machine
they got above her head,

855
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:28,749
telling us that
she's still with us.

856
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:35,515
So I turn to God once again.

857
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:39,795
Only this time,
I get down on my knees,

858
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,590
like I think you're supposed to,

859
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:45,697
on this filthy green hospital
tile floor, and I beg Him.

860
00:50:45,732 --> 00:50:48,562
I beg... begged Him.

861
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:53,878
"Please, let Alice live.

862
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:56,294
"Please, take me.

863
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:58,296
"If you're mad at somebody,
be mad at me.

864
00:50:58,331 --> 00:51:00,850
If you want to punish someone,
punish me."

865
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:03,267
And I'm telling you,
I meant this with all my heart,

866
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:04,440
everything I was asking.

867
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,856
I even forgave Him about Mike!

868
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:10,826
And then just like before...

869
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:15,831
...nothing.

870
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:18,351
Not a fly flapping its wings.

871
00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:19,904
Nothing.

872
00:51:22,527 --> 00:51:25,392
Then, um...

873
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:28,499
oh, maybe 60-- not even 60--
30 seconds later,

874
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:30,811
I... I hear it.

875
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:32,848
That little beep.

876
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,920
It goes flat,

877
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:39,406
the sound that death makes,

878
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,374
and I get His answer.

879
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:46,620
"Sorry, Joe.

880
00:51:46,655 --> 00:51:48,588
Too little, too late."

881
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:57,769
Twice I tried.

882
00:51:57,804 --> 00:52:00,324
Twice I was denied.

883
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:02,360
I figure, you reach out
to somebody, anybody,

884
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:05,363
certainly God, for hope
and mercy and compassion,

885
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:08,228
and you get nothing back,
anything back, it's just a...

886
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:14,407
...yeah, a fantasy you make up
to keep from going nuts.

887
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:24,900
That wall?

888
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:28,904
That's real.

889
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:32,183
I know it's there,
it knows I'm here.

890
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:33,736
Mutual respect.

891
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:38,914
God never gave me as much.

892
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:42,262
That's not God, those words.

893
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:44,713
Oh, yeah? Then who?

894
00:52:44,747 --> 00:52:47,612
Who was it who took my
son in a blink of an eye?

895
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:49,649
And who has
such a supreme authority,

896
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:53,480
such an audacity to let
my beau-- my beautiful,

897
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:56,483
my beautiful wife,

898
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:59,417
everything I love,

899
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:03,249
she died lying face down
on the asphalt

900
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:07,425
when she gave nothing but love
to everyone who came around her.

901
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,772
Who?

902
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:11,602
Not God.

903
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,471
Well, maybe you're right.

904
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:20,852
Maybe it's just...

905
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:22,992
the man in the mirror.

906
00:53:25,857 --> 00:53:28,239
Maybe it's nothing at all.

907
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,863
Either way...

908
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:35,902
...I, uh,

909
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:38,215
I'm gonna leave it at that.

910
00:53:56,923 --> 00:53:59,443
You okay?

911
00:54:14,423 --> 00:54:17,495
I'm sorry.

912
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,463
I'm so sorry.

913
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:24,537
Sorry for what?

914
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,747
For letting you down.

915
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,852
Using all those words I...

916
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,510
Joe, by the time
we fell in love,

917
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:34,581
I knew what I was getting into.

918
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:36,825
Well, then that's on you.

919
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:39,310
But you're the one
punching holes in walls.

920
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:41,312
Back to fists?

921
00:54:41,347 --> 00:54:45,109
Dropping F-bombs
like it's Hiroshima.

922
00:54:45,143 --> 00:54:48,768
Well, that's what you
get for leaving me here alone.

923
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,909
We're never alone.
It's a choice.

924
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:53,842
I don't know.

925
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:57,363
It's like you're
a million miles away.

926
00:54:57,397 --> 00:55:00,055
I lose a little piece of you
every day.

927
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:02,471
Every minute.

928
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:05,647
The choices you make
have always been yours.

929
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,719
Never needed me for that.

930
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:11,377
You always helped.

931
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:13,827
One look in your eyes, and...

932
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,074
...I had all the answers.

933
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,989
Come here.

934
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:39,957
Come on.

935
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:52,763
Dog?

936
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:56,905
Ah, come on, where are you?

937
00:56:44,055 --> 00:56:46,644
Hey. Hey! Can I help you?

938
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:48,819
Mr. Bigler.

939
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:50,855
-How you doing, sir?
-I'm doing fine.

940
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,443
What are you doing over there?

941
00:56:52,478 --> 00:56:55,239
I was thinking
I could use a truck.

942
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:57,172
Well, I think
that's more than you need.

943
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,795
Right. Oh, man.

944
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,212
Personally, I want to live as
far away from work as possible.

945
00:57:03,247 --> 00:57:05,732
Hey, look, I know you didn't
come here to talk about trucks

946
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:09,840
or where you want to live, so if
you got something on your mind,

947
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:12,532
I'm kind of
in the middle of things.

948
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:16,053
No, actually, I think
I may be able to help you.

949
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:18,193
How so?

950
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,471
You mentioned before that
people were trying to force you

951
00:57:20,506 --> 00:57:21,886
-out of your house here?
-Yeah.

952
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:23,716
Yeah, yeah.
So they can just rip it down

953
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:28,099
and put up whatever they got
planned for the land next door.

954
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:30,101
And you think maybe your
wife's accident had something

955
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:31,965
to do with that, getting you
out of this place here?

956
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,484
I'd stake my life on it.

957
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,142
She was killed. They made it
look like an accident.

958
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:37,626
They figured I'd be so broken up

959
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:39,214
that I-I wouldn't want
to stick around.

960
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:41,285
Are you broken up?

961
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:43,632
Yeah, of course.
What kind of question is that?

962
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:45,565
But you have no plans
of leaving?

963
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,740
They're gonna have to
carry me out in a bag.

964
00:57:47,774 --> 00:57:49,742
I hear that.

965
00:57:49,776 --> 00:57:52,261
Look, the case is still open.

966
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:55,679
I was thinking maybe
I'll take a stab at it.

967
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:57,681
Really?

968
00:57:57,715 --> 00:58:00,649
Yeah, it seems like
the right thing to do.

969
00:58:00,684 --> 00:58:03,997
Well, thank you.
That-that would mean a lot.

970
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:07,138
But to be fair, the detectives
assigned to this case,

971
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:08,968
they've done a good job,
they've done their work.

972
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:10,728
Yeah, well, if in your book,
not figuring out

973
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:12,868
who killed my wife is
"a good job," I...

974
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:14,318
They've gone door-to-door
for witnesses,

975
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:17,114
checked out security cameras,
checked body shops.

976
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:19,703
They checked your wife's cell
phone recovered at the scene

977
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:21,256
to see who she was
in contact with during the time.

978
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,326
I-I don't understand.

979
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,293
What does her phone
have to do with anything?

980
00:58:24,328 --> 00:58:27,193
Look, you wanted them to do
their job, look at all angles.

981
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:29,091
That's part of what we do.

982
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:32,094
It just seems like
an invasion, that's all.

983
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:36,236
Uh, so what'd they find when
they looked at these records?

984
00:58:36,271 --> 00:58:37,514
Nothing solid.

985
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:40,137
But my point is that they've
done a good job, all right?

986
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:41,932
They've been very thorough.

987
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:44,175
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen like I said.

988
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:48,317
It has nothing to do with cell
phones or cell phone records.

989
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:51,597
Someone killed her
to get this place.

990
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:53,599
That's what happened.

991
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:57,741
And I think it's an angle
that needs to be addressed.

992
00:58:57,775 --> 00:59:00,640
Oh, who's this?

993
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,573
Dog.

994
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:06,197
Bad dog. Bad dog.

995
00:59:06,232 --> 00:59:08,027
Where were you?

996
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:10,270
Yeah, yeah.
Get in there. Go on.

997
00:59:10,305 --> 00:59:12,549
Get in there.

998
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:17,864
He's a real pain in the butt,
but I deal with him.

999
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:19,866
Got one myself.

1000
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:22,317
Only mine's a teenager who wants
the life and luxury of LeBron,

1001
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:25,216
but he's too short and cant
shoot a hoop to save his life.

1002
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:27,702
Look...

1003
00:59:27,736 --> 00:59:30,187
I'll tell you how it goes,
all right?

1004
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:35,744
If you can think of anything,
need to talk, that's my cell.

1005
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:39,127
Anytime, all right?
Let's put this thing to bed.

1006
00:59:39,161 --> 00:59:40,818
Thank you.

1007
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:42,717
No, I-I mean that.

1008
00:59:42,751 --> 00:59:44,235
Thank you.

1009
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:20,651
You know, I could turn him
into a fighter.

1010
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:22,998
-He's got strong hands.
-Don't even think it.

1011
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,690
One is enough.

1012
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:28,003
Thanks for letting me
spend some time.

1013
01:00:28,038 --> 01:00:30,143
Yeah, it's good,
for both of you.

1014
01:00:30,178 --> 01:00:32,283
Ah, for all of us.

1015
01:00:35,355 --> 01:00:39,981
You weren't exactly wrong about
me, what you said the other day.

1016
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:42,984
-Zoe, we don't have to do this.
-No, you were right.

1017
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,296
I do, and...

1018
01:00:45,331 --> 01:00:48,023
I grab for things,
whatever, just to,

1019
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:50,405
I don't know,
make sense of it all.

1020
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,719
We all do.
That's human nature.

1021
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:56,273
Somehow we think
it's just us. Me.

1022
01:00:56,307 --> 01:00:59,207
Mm-hmm.

1023
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:05,834
I just don't understand
how a man could

1024
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,871
-abandon his kid like that.
-Dad...

1025
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:10,149
I'm sorry. You're right.
I won't go there.

1026
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:14,809
You're all I got.
You and Adam.

1027
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:23,300
Dad, I need you to be okay
for me to be okay.

1028
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:26,855
I wish I could just flip
a switch, make it better faster,

1029
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,374
but I'm not wired that way.

1030
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:30,341
Definitely not.

1031
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:35,105
Zoe,

1032
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:37,866
you and I, we-we don't see
eye to eye on everything.

1033
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:39,109
You know, a lot of things.

1034
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:41,249
Your mother and I certainly
didn't, that's for sure.

1035
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:44,252
But...

1036
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:46,495
I'm glad for what you found.

1037
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,497
It's a safe place.
It's a good place.

1038
01:01:50,568 --> 01:01:54,262
I'm happy that its taken away
some of the pain.

1039
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:56,402
Thank you.

1040
01:02:01,372 --> 01:02:05,100
Faith.
It's a funny thing, huh?

1041
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,102
Fickle and funny
in who it chooses.

1042
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:12,142
Not me.

1043
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:15,076
But your mother
always had my back.

1044
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,043
And now that she's gone?

1045
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:24,982
Well, now that she's gone,
I got this guy.

1046
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:27,260
Don't I, Dog?

1047
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:28,779
Keeping me on
the straight and narrow.

1048
01:02:28,814 --> 01:02:31,023
Talk about faithful.

1049
01:02:31,057 --> 01:02:33,232
I can't get rid of him
if I wanted to.

1050
01:02:33,266 --> 01:02:36,131
Who needs a leash?

1051
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:39,376
I hate to say this, but we have
to try to find his owner.

1052
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,136
We have to just try.

1053
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:44,519
Hmm?

1054
01:02:47,418 --> 01:02:50,249
He's saying,
"Nobody owns nobody."

1055
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:53,183
He's turning you
into a softy.

1056
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:57,152
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

1057
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:58,982
Just a couple of moves,
I promise.

1058
01:02:59,016 --> 01:03:00,949
- Strictly self-defense.
- Oh.

1059
01:03:06,644 --> 01:03:08,439
Come on, right there.

1060
01:03:08,474 --> 01:03:09,440
Boom!

1061
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:31,522
I'm telling you,
my bank was in on it.

1062
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:33,628
Joe, just slow down, all right?
Let's think about this.

1063
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,147
Rollins,
please listen carefully.

1064
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:36,665
Look, my wife dies, right?

1065
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,529
I don't pay my mortgage
for a couple of months.

1066
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:40,221
Give me a break,
my wife just died!

1067
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:41,463
You should see all these-these--

1068
01:04:41,498 --> 01:04:44,639
not just bills but these-these
threats they're sending!

1069
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,710
-Threats?
-Yeah, in so many words.

1070
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:48,919
All right, okay. Look.

1071
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:51,611
Listen very carefully.
First thing they got to do is

1072
01:04:51,646 --> 01:04:53,717
they got to get me out of here,
so what do they do?

1073
01:04:53,751 --> 01:04:56,478
They foreclose on me.
The bank.

1074
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:58,308
They're the real crooks here.

1075
01:04:58,342 --> 01:05:01,552
Next, the builder comes in
and buys my house from the bank

1076
01:05:01,587 --> 01:05:04,107
at a discounted price.
Bank wins.

1077
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:06,005
Next, the builder tears it down.

1078
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,250
They go back to the same bank to
get financing for whatever it is

1079
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:13,081
that they're gonna put up,
some work/live lofts, whatever.

1080
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:14,289
Bank wins again.

1081
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:17,223
Whoever buys this
whatever-it-is,

1082
01:05:17,258 --> 01:05:19,053
at the suggestion
of the builder,

1083
01:05:19,087 --> 01:05:22,677
goes back to the very same bank
to get their mortgage.

1084
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,093
Bank wins again.
That's three times.

1085
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:26,715
Three times. They all win.

1086
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,994
They all win because
they're all in on it together.

1087
01:05:29,028 --> 01:05:31,306
They all win, everybody but me.

1088
01:05:31,341 --> 01:05:35,103
I lose my house, I lose my wife.

1089
01:05:35,138 --> 01:05:36,587
Wow.

1090
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:38,693
-You really thought this through.
-I have,

1091
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,350
and I can see that
you know what I'm saying here.

1092
01:05:40,384 --> 01:05:42,386
Yeah, but killing someone
and covering it up?

1093
01:05:42,421 --> 01:05:43,767
Why not?
Go to church on Sunday,

1094
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:45,596
back to work on Monday.
Clean slate.

1095
01:05:45,631 --> 01:05:48,461
Of course, the banks will
tell you it's just business.

1096
01:05:48,496 --> 01:05:51,533
Okay. I'll take a look into it.

1097
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:56,711
Ah, classic.

1098
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,609
Ah, "I'll take a look into it."

1099
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:00,335
Okay, Kojak.

1100
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,613
That's a blow-off line
if I've ever heard one.

1101
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:04,581
I just think
you're reaching here, Joe.

1102
01:06:04,615 --> 01:06:06,790
I mean, banks don't do that.
That's not the way it works.

1103
01:06:06,824 --> 01:06:09,620
Hey, the banks, all of them,
just watch the news!

1104
01:06:09,655 --> 01:06:12,244
You know what? Forget it.
I'll deal with it myself.

1105
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:13,762
Joe, I told you that I'll...

1106
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:15,764
Thanks for your help.

1107
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:31,435
-Mr. Bigler?
-Yeah, that's right.

1108
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,713
Sorry to keep you waiting.
What can I do for you today?

1109
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:36,164
Uh, do you think we could go
somewhere more private?

1110
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:37,510
Yeah, of course.
Come on in.

1111
01:06:37,545 --> 01:06:40,134
Hey, come on.
Let's go, Dog.

1112
01:06:40,168 --> 01:06:42,722
In there.

1113
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:46,381
Let's just, uh,
cut right to it, hmm?

1114
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,763
-You recognize those?
-Mortgage bills. Are they yours?

1115
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:51,386
No, they're his.

1116
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,112
Of course they're mine.

1117
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,321
Name Alice Bigler
mean anything to you?

1118
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:59,084
My guess is your wife maybe.
Is she also a client here?

1119
01:06:59,118 --> 01:07:00,533
She was my wife.
She's gone now.

1120
01:07:00,568 --> 01:07:02,397
-She was killed.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1121
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:03,847
You know anything about that?

1122
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:06,574
What?

1123
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,438
Ah, ah. Don't look at him.

1124
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:11,613
-I'm the story here.
-I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1125
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:13,098
I think you do.

1126
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:15,790
Rob?

1127
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,550
That's your name? Rob?

1128
01:07:17,585 --> 01:07:19,828
Your parents have a crystal ball
or something?

1129
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:21,865
All right.

1130
01:07:21,899 --> 01:07:24,626
Rob, uh...

1131
01:07:24,661 --> 01:07:26,697
I've been a customer here
for 25 years,

1132
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:28,872
well before the fancy remodel.

1133
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:30,736
I've never seen you
around before.

1134
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:34,395
Probably because I've only been
here a little over three months.

1135
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:35,741
Three months.

1136
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:37,363
Huh, is that right?

1137
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:40,608
Yeah, they-they tend
to shuffle us around.

1138
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:42,127
How convenient.

1139
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:45,440
Three months ago,
you got shuffled.

1140
01:07:47,546 --> 01:07:51,170
Mr. Bigler, I have no idea
what's going on here,

1141
01:07:51,205 --> 01:07:54,863
and I have no idea
how I can help you

1142
01:07:54,898 --> 01:07:56,796
or even what your concern is.
Now, perhaps if...

1143
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:58,902
My wife dies.

1144
01:07:58,936 --> 01:08:01,387
I get a stack of bills
from you guys, followed by

1145
01:08:01,422 --> 01:08:04,287
twice as many threats
to "pay up, or else."

1146
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:06,496
All because I take
time off to grieve.

1147
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,188
Starting to sound familiar, Rob?

1148
01:08:09,223 --> 01:08:11,259
Uh, is-is this what you're
referring to as threats?

1149
01:08:11,294 --> 01:08:12,709
You tell me.

1150
01:08:12,743 --> 01:08:14,607
Well, Mr. Bigler,
these are courtesy letters.

1151
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:16,782
The bank sends these out
whenever a customer is late.

1152
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:18,646
It's a-a friendly reminder,
if you will.

1153
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,165
That's how you see it.

1154
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:23,375
I see it differently,
not so friendly.

1155
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:27,758
Are you still behind currently,
on your payments?

1156
01:08:27,793 --> 01:08:30,899
Again, you tell me.

1157
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:39,460
Well, looks like
just a couple of months.

1158
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:43,429
Three months.
Three months, to be exact.

1159
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:45,535
Well, we can certainly
take care of that today,

1160
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:46,881
if that's what you want.

1161
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:48,883
Uh, or under the circumstances,

1162
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:52,197
I-I'm certain we could
get an extension.

1163
01:08:52,231 --> 01:08:54,164
At the very least,
I-I'd be glad to waive

1164
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:55,855
-some of th-the penalties for...
-Ah, gee.

1165
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:57,788
That's awfully nice of you.

1166
01:08:57,823 --> 01:08:59,790
Okay, so if that's
the only problem...

1167
01:08:59,825 --> 01:09:02,793
No, the problem is,
the problem is, Rob,

1168
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:04,450
you can't have my house.

1169
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:06,797
I'm not an idiot.
I know your plan here,

1170
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:08,799
and you can't pivot me
with a couple of

1171
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:09,973
meaningless goodwill gestures.

1172
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:11,664
I can assure you,
it is never our goal

1173
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:14,288
to take a home, especially not
after a loss like yours.

1174
01:09:14,322 --> 01:09:17,256
Oh, so if I didn't have a loss
like mine, you might think about

1175
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:19,465
-taking my house?
-No, that's not what I meant.

1176
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,742
We-we just don't do
that sort of thing.

1177
01:09:20,777 --> 01:09:22,710
Give me a break!
You killed her to get my house.

1178
01:09:22,744 --> 01:09:24,781
You and whoever it is
that you're working for,

1179
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:27,370
you killed her to get my house,
it didn't work,

1180
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:28,854
and now here I am
to call you on it.

1181
01:09:28,888 --> 01:09:31,201
Okay, I think this conversation
is over now.

1182
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:32,582
No, no, Rob.

1183
01:09:32,616 --> 01:09:34,618
- Why, Joe?
- This guy!

1184
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:36,482
That's not what I'm asking.

1185
01:09:36,517 --> 01:09:38,381
This is for you, Alice.
This is for you.

1186
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:39,934
No, it's for you.

1187
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,211
Mr. Bigler...

1188
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:43,213
- Why, Joe?
- You say it.

1189
01:09:43,248 --> 01:09:44,870
"I killed her."
You say it, we're done here.

1190
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:45,905
Just say it.

1191
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,356
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1192
01:09:48,391 --> 01:09:49,944
-Again, Joe, why?
-Say it!

1193
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:52,429
"I killed her"! Say it!

1194
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:55,432
One last time, why?

1195
01:10:04,924 --> 01:10:07,858
You got no idea how hard it is
living with somebody who sees

1196
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:11,759
everything so perfect
all the time, especially when

1197
01:10:11,793 --> 01:10:15,383
all you can sm-smell is
the rot underneath it all.

1198
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:16,867
Doubt.

1199
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:19,629
In everything you love.

1200
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:21,734
Still, she never quit on me.

1201
01:10:21,769 --> 01:10:23,391
Not once.

1202
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:43,963
Joe?

1203
01:10:43,998 --> 01:10:45,310
Hey, Alice, sweetie, you got to

1204
01:10:45,344 --> 01:10:46,690
answer your phone
when I call you.

1205
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:48,278
Do you have any idea
where my glasses are?

1206
01:10:48,313 --> 01:10:50,591
-What?
-My glasses. I can't find them.

1207
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,040
I told you before I left,

1208
01:10:52,075 --> 01:10:55,458
they're right on the TV cabinet
next to the remote.

1209
01:10:55,492 --> 01:10:57,322
Well, I'm standing right here,
they're not here.

1210
01:10:57,356 --> 01:10:58,599
They must have walked off

1211
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:00,394
or I need them
worse than I think

1212
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:01,602
because I've looked everywhere.

1213
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:03,362
-They're not here.
-Joe.

1214
01:11:03,397 --> 01:11:04,950
I've looked everywhere, Alice.

1215
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:06,814
Well, just use mine.
They're in the kitchen.

1216
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:08,954
And I'll just find yours
when I get back, okay?

1217
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:11,301
-How far away are you?
-Joe.

1218
01:11:11,336 --> 01:11:12,923
How far away are you?

1219
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,718
I'm just on the road, but...

1220
01:11:14,753 --> 01:11:16,617
Well, I need you
to turn around and come back.

1221
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:18,515
I need them.
I need mine, not yours.

1222
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,345
I got a pile of work to do.

1223
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:21,932
Yeah, and I've got a ride to do.

1224
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:24,107
Alice, I need you
to turn around and come back.

1225
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:25,350
Joe!

1226
01:11:25,384 --> 01:11:26,937
I need you to come back now.

1227
01:11:26,972 --> 01:11:29,526
You're a real piece of work
lately, you know that?

1228
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:31,045
Come back now.

1229
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:01,696
-Morning, Joe.
-What now?

1230
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:04,492
You can't just walk into a bank
and blow off steam.

1231
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:06,839
-It blows back.
-Yeah, I was wrong.

1232
01:12:06,874 --> 01:12:08,841
I'm gonna go in today
and patch things up.

1233
01:12:08,876 --> 01:12:10,981
It's not that easy,
not this time.

1234
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:13,432
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
are you, what are you doing?

1235
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:15,158
What-what are you...

1236
01:12:15,192 --> 01:12:16,884
I warned you.

1237
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:19,369
What-what's going on here?

1238
01:12:19,404 --> 01:12:21,406
Placing you under arrest
for aggravated assault.

1239
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,407
What?

1240
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:24,926
Are you in on this now, too,
Rollins, huh?

1241
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:27,653
I just wanted to scare him,
make him talk, that's all.

1242
01:12:27,688 --> 01:12:28,792
You have the right
to remain silent.

1243
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:29,966
Anything you say can and will be
used against you...

1244
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,036
Fine, you won't do your job,
I'll do it for you.

1245
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,796
-Whatever.
-You have the right to an attorney.

1246
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:33,797
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1247
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:35,523
one will be appointed for you.

1248
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:38,457
Yeah, yeah,
we've all seen the TV show.

1249
01:12:40,597 --> 01:12:42,979
You know a good lawyer?

1250
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:44,912
This is gonna be recorded.

1251
01:12:44,946 --> 01:12:47,017
I-I told you,
I'm gonna apologize to the guy.

1252
01:12:47,052 --> 01:12:49,468
Do we need these theatrics?
Come on, turn that thing off.

1253
01:12:49,503 --> 01:12:50,780
I have a couple questions.

1254
01:12:50,814 --> 01:12:54,404
Uh, this is-- are you--
this is a joke, right?

1255
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:56,406
First, you refuse
your right to have

1256
01:12:56,441 --> 01:12:58,512
legal representation present,
is that correct?

1257
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:00,997
-Because I got nothing to hide.
-Yes or no?

1258
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:02,688
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1259
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,449
You sure you don't want
to call your daughter?

1260
01:13:04,483 --> 01:13:07,106
-Absolutely not.
-All right.

1261
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:09,108
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions

1262
01:13:09,143 --> 01:13:10,662
about you and your wife.

1263
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:13,043
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1264
01:13:13,078 --> 01:13:15,011
The last person
your wife talked to was you.

1265
01:13:15,045 --> 01:13:17,669
On her cell phone,
right before the accident.

1266
01:13:17,703 --> 01:13:20,188
-Give or take a minute or two...
-You serious?

1267
01:13:20,223 --> 01:13:21,189
...depending on the timeline
we've created

1268
01:13:21,224 --> 01:13:23,226
with some of the first folks
on the scene.

1269
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,608
-What timeline?
-A witness several blocks away

1270
01:13:25,642 --> 01:13:28,058
reported a white truck speeding
through around the same time.

1271
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:29,888
Th-This is insane.

1272
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:31,614
You did call her, correct?
On her cell phone?

1273
01:13:31,648 --> 01:13:33,857
-While she was on her bike?
-Yeah, but it was...

1274
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:35,583
You mind sharing
what you discussed?

1275
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:38,931
Are you accusing me
of this now, too?

1276
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:41,037
What happened to her?
What is with you people?

1277
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:42,452
I'm not accusing anyone,
all right?

1278
01:13:42,487 --> 01:13:45,559
I'm just finishing up what you
asked me to pursue, that's it.

1279
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:48,182
This isn't what I had in mind.

1280
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:52,497
It was nothing.

1281
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:54,982
I told her I lost my glasses,

1282
01:13:55,016 --> 01:13:57,156
asked her if she knew
where they were, she said no.

1283
01:13:57,191 --> 01:13:59,642
-End of story.
-Are you sure? That's it?

1284
01:13:59,676 --> 01:14:01,920
Yes, that's it.

1285
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:03,542
You have a temper.

1286
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:05,095
First Norman Olsen,
now this guy at the bank.

1287
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,477
Unbelievable.

1288
01:14:07,512 --> 01:14:09,755
The dent and the scratch

1289
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:12,275
on the front right bumper
of your truck.

1290
01:14:12,309 --> 01:14:14,795
If we run a test on that,
what will we find?

1291
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:17,901
You'll find out that I ran into
a post at a hardware store.

1292
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:20,007
Believe me, the post
got the worst of it.

1293
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,078
-You report it?
-It was a post.

1294
01:14:25,115 --> 01:14:26,807
You were checking me out.

1295
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:30,017
Weren't you?
At my house. My truck.

1296
01:14:30,051 --> 01:14:33,538
Snooping around, even then.

1297
01:14:33,572 --> 01:14:35,056
And the cracked running light?

1298
01:14:35,091 --> 01:14:37,196
Same run-in with the post?

1299
01:14:40,303 --> 01:14:43,720
I remember, once in the ring,
back when I was getting started,

1300
01:14:43,755 --> 01:14:46,654
I knocked this guy down.

1301
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:48,656
And I felt bad for him.

1302
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:52,108
Can you imagine that, a fighter
feeling bad for the other guy?

1303
01:14:52,142 --> 01:14:55,732
So I help him back up to his
feet, show him some compassion.

1304
01:15:00,703 --> 01:15:02,670
Anyway, dumb move.

1305
01:15:02,705 --> 01:15:06,122
Guy clocks me,
knocks me right out.

1306
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:10,782
I gave you more credit, Rollins.

1307
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:13,957
I was trying to help you, you...

1308
01:15:19,066 --> 01:15:20,895
I never learn.

1309
01:15:22,966 --> 01:15:24,899
Dumb move.

1310
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:44,194
Now, there's a sight.

1311
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:46,680
What a mess.

1312
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:51,305
Yes.

1313
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:54,722
It is.

1314
01:15:54,757 --> 01:15:57,691
Can't see up from down
anymore, Alice.

1315
01:16:03,006 --> 01:16:04,939
So look sideways.

1316
01:16:11,843 --> 01:16:13,776
There's my girl.

1317
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:21,197
Ah, I miss you.

1318
01:16:21,231 --> 01:16:25,063
I'd give everything in this
world to be with you right now.

1319
01:16:25,097 --> 01:16:26,996
Wherever that is.

1320
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:31,000
I'm right here.

1321
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:37,075
And from the looks of it,

1322
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:39,940
neither of us
is going anywhere soon.

1323
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:49,639
But again, that's your choice.

1324
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,263
Damage I've done.

1325
01:16:55,921 --> 01:16:59,304
Ever think it might be time
to give yourself a break?

1326
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:05,275
If I do,
I might lose you forever.

1327
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,278
If you don't...

1328
01:17:08,313 --> 01:17:10,867
you just might.

1329
01:17:10,902 --> 01:17:12,835
Risky.

1330
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:18,737
To forgive and to forget
are two different things.

1331
01:17:21,222 --> 01:17:23,155
I know you know that.

1332
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:35,029
You're a miracle.

1333
01:17:37,204 --> 01:17:39,068
So are you.

1334
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:42,899
A work in progress.

1335
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:56,361
I'm so sorry for making
such a mess of it all.

1336
01:17:56,395 --> 01:18:00,330
For making you turn around
and come home.

1337
01:18:00,365 --> 01:18:03,368
Why... why'd I...

1338
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:05,335
why'd I do that?

1339
01:18:09,236 --> 01:18:11,169
What for?

1340
01:18:21,455 --> 01:18:24,320
I'm-I'm sorry.

1341
01:18:24,354 --> 01:18:27,530
Shh.

1342
01:18:27,564 --> 01:18:29,428
I forgive you.

1343
01:18:51,243 --> 01:18:52,900
Thanks for doing this.

1344
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:54,522
I'll pay you back, of course.

1345
01:18:54,557 --> 01:18:56,041
Sell the house,
whatever it takes.

1346
01:18:56,076 --> 01:18:58,078
I'm done with all of it,
I promise.

1347
01:18:58,112 --> 01:19:00,839
Don't thank me, thank him.

1348
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,429
Of course.

1349
01:19:04,463 --> 01:19:06,086
Be grateful.

1350
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,571
And whatever you do,
don't leave town.

1351
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:10,538
Just like TV.

1352
01:19:13,093 --> 01:19:14,577
Thank you.

1353
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:50,061
You are a terrier, right?
That's my best guess.

1354
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:56,481
Look, you're starting
to grow on me, too,

1355
01:19:56,515 --> 01:19:58,932
but we got to find out
who owns you.

1356
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:00,934
Time for both of us to move on.

1357
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:02,867
You sure you don't want
to go out with me,

1358
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:05,421
help me put
these things up, hmm?

1359
01:20:05,455 --> 01:20:08,424
Starting to think this whole
"man's best friend" thing

1360
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:11,841
ain't for nothing.

1361
01:20:11,876 --> 01:20:15,845
And you never bark,
for which I am hugely grateful.

1362
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,813
Not a bit confused.

1363
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:28,962
I knew you'd come around.

1364
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:48,360
Come on.

1365
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,019
Sorry.

1366
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:09,036
Hey! Hey. Hey, slow down.

1367
01:21:09,071 --> 01:21:11,383
Dog!

1368
01:21:11,418 --> 01:21:13,454
Oh. Oh.

1369
01:21:17,182 --> 01:21:18,528
Oh. Oh.

1370
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,326
Sorry. Sorry.

1371
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:25,294
Dog!

1372
01:21:36,408 --> 01:21:39,101
Come on.

1373
01:21:55,013 --> 01:21:56,463
What?

1374
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,024
Ah, slow-- Hey.

1375
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:07,370
Hey! Hey!

1376
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:12,099
All right.

1377
01:22:14,205 --> 01:22:16,414
Stop.

1378
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,416
You're not doing my knees
any favors, pal.

1379
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:21,177
What? What?

1380
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:25,699
This place over here,
what about it?

1381
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,980
Oh.

1382
01:22:33,465 --> 01:22:35,398
This is where you live?

1383
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:40,990
You're not messing with me,
are you?

1384
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:46,030
All right.

1385
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:48,170
I guess this is it, then, huh?

1386
01:22:48,204 --> 01:22:51,587
What? What?

1387
01:22:51,621 --> 01:22:53,554
You want me to take you
over there?

1388
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:58,559
No. These people are gonna be
mad that I kept you for so long.

1389
01:22:58,594 --> 01:23:00,285
You go on. Go on.

1390
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:07,327
Fine.

1391
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:10,709
All right, let's...
just get this over with.

1392
01:23:10,744 --> 01:23:12,780
Come on. Let's go.

1393
01:23:12,815 --> 01:23:14,472
Come on.

1394
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:18,510
Come on.

1395
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:29,211
Hello?

1396
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:35,010
Hello?

1397
01:23:37,081 --> 01:23:38,703
What?

1398
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:40,601
Hey.

1399
01:23:47,746 --> 01:23:49,645
What?

1400
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,235
What-what are you doing?

1401
01:23:53,269 --> 01:23:55,444
I shouldn't be
snooping around like this.

1402
01:23:55,478 --> 01:23:57,480
I'm already in enough trouble.

1403
01:23:57,515 --> 01:24:00,449
If this is your house
and you want to stay, stay.

1404
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:02,658
But I'm not snooping around
like this.

1405
01:24:04,867 --> 01:24:06,317
What?

1406
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:34,646
You're the one
who took me there.

1407
01:25:34,681 --> 01:25:37,615
This is on you
as much as it is me.

1408
01:25:37,649 --> 01:25:41,308
Think it through, Joe.

1409
01:25:41,343 --> 01:25:44,484
-Somebody's gonna get hurt.
-That's the idea.

1410
01:25:44,518 --> 01:25:47,418
I could almost feel you.
You were so close.

1411
01:25:47,452 --> 01:25:49,661
What happened?

1412
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,630
Loose ends.
Guilt has to be assigned.

1413
01:25:52,664 --> 01:25:54,528
This is revenge.

1414
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:56,461
Call it what you want.

1415
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:02,674
They're accusing me, Alice.

1416
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:04,849
And this is how
you set them straight.

1417
01:26:04,883 --> 01:26:07,679
Yes. This is how
I set them straight.

1418
01:26:07,714 --> 01:26:09,474
This is anger, not truth.

1419
01:26:09,509 --> 01:26:13,271
Alice, I love you,
but I'm begging you, not now.

1420
01:26:13,306 --> 01:26:16,792
One way or the other,
it all ends tonight.

1421
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:19,346
You do this, Joe,
and you are on your own.

1422
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,348
I am gone, forever.

1423
01:26:21,383 --> 01:26:22,625
-Alice...
-And you know that.

1424
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:25,352
Alice, I got no more fight left.

1425
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,630
The problem is
you never had fight, real fight.

1426
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:30,254
-You punch at shadows...
-Alice, not now!

1427
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:31,565
...make holes in walls...

1428
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,567
Would you get the heck out of
here and let me finish this?!

1429
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:34,879
...and the only person
who ever gets beaten up

1430
01:26:34,913 --> 01:26:37,537
-over and over again is you.
-Leave!

1431
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:36,414
Wow.

1432
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:47,598
You better say something soon,

1433
01:28:47,632 --> 01:28:49,807
'cause this guns
got a mind of its own.

1434
01:28:49,841 --> 01:28:51,912
How about we start with a name?

1435
01:28:54,018 --> 01:28:56,503
-Nathan Wells.
-Oh.

1436
01:28:56,538 --> 01:28:58,850
Oh, good evening, Nathan.

1437
01:28:58,885 --> 01:29:00,611
I'm Joe.

1438
01:29:04,822 --> 01:29:06,755
You found my dog.

1439
01:29:09,758 --> 01:29:11,484
So you belong to this punk?

1440
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:15,729
If it means anything,
I've tried to--

1441
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:19,077
since it happened, I-I've stood
outside your house...

1442
01:29:19,112 --> 01:29:20,424
Wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa.

1443
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,391
You're also the same guy
that's been

1444
01:29:22,426 --> 01:29:23,875
creeping around
my house at night?

1445
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:25,670
It was just an accident.

1446
01:29:25,705 --> 01:29:28,984
Whatever you think, I promise
you, it was an accident.

1447
01:29:29,018 --> 01:29:30,813
Oh.

1448
01:29:30,848 --> 01:29:32,988
Well, you promise me, then...

1449
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:43,792
Huh?

1450
01:29:45,863 --> 01:29:48,210
Huh? Go on.

1451
01:29:48,244 --> 01:29:50,212
No?

1452
01:29:50,246 --> 01:29:53,077
Well, it looks like he switched
teams on you, Nathan.

1453
01:29:53,111 --> 01:29:55,459
-King.
-Huh?

1454
01:29:55,493 --> 01:29:57,737
His name is King.

1455
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:03,052
I call him Dog,
but King, King kind of works.

1456
01:30:03,087 --> 01:30:06,987
Of course, it makes him a royal
pain in the butt.

1457
01:30:07,022 --> 01:30:09,024
It was an accident.

1458
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:13,994
You say that once again and,
so help me, I will shoot you

1459
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:16,065
right here on the spot.

1460
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:17,619
Like that's supposed
to make it all right.

1461
01:30:17,653 --> 01:30:19,068
"It was an accident."

1462
01:30:19,103 --> 01:30:21,139
Please.

1463
01:30:21,174 --> 01:30:23,797
We can work this out.
I'll do anything.

1464
01:30:23,832 --> 01:30:25,799
Give me one reason,
give me one reason

1465
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:27,698
why I should show you
an ounce of mercy,

1466
01:30:27,732 --> 01:30:30,770
when you didn't think twice
about doing the same for my wife

1467
01:30:30,804 --> 01:30:32,634
and then you ran off
like a coward.

1468
01:30:32,668 --> 01:30:34,118
I was wrong.

1469
01:30:34,152 --> 01:30:37,604
Do you know what they told me
after she was gone?

1470
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:40,538
They said that if whoever hit
her called for help one minute,

1471
01:30:40,573 --> 01:30:42,885
maybe just one minute sooner,

1472
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,887
they might have been able
to save her.

1473
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:47,234
One minute. Ticktock.

1474
01:30:47,269 --> 01:30:50,790
My wife-- she's inside.
She's pregnant.

1475
01:30:50,824 --> 01:30:53,896
Well, my wife's dead.
I think I got you beat, pal.

1476
01:30:53,931 --> 01:30:56,968
What can I do?
We could go to the police.

1477
01:30:57,003 --> 01:30:58,660
I'll tell them everything,
I swear to...

1478
01:30:58,694 --> 01:31:00,040
Too little, too late.

1479
01:31:02,905 --> 01:31:04,597
Join the club.

1480
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:11,086
All right. Here's what
we're gonna do, Nathan.

1481
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,122
Anyone ever call you Nate?

1482
01:31:13,157 --> 01:31:15,124
No. No, not really.

1483
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:17,920
All right, then, Nate.

1484
01:31:17,955 --> 01:31:20,923
One minute from now,
that's 60 seconds,

1485
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:22,994
I'm gonna shoot you dead.
It's a fact.

1486
01:31:23,029 --> 01:31:25,100
I'm gonna kill you
because you killed my wife.

1487
01:31:25,134 --> 01:31:27,067
One minute from now.

1488
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:29,691
Same amount of time, if you'd
made one simple phone call,

1489
01:31:29,725 --> 01:31:32,935
you might have been able
to save her.

1490
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:36,145
You ever hear that expression
"all the time in the world"?

1491
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:39,321
One minute just became
what's left of yours.

1492
01:31:39,355 --> 01:31:40,840
No.

1493
01:31:40,874 --> 01:31:43,221
-"No," what?
-I don't want to die.

1494
01:31:43,256 --> 01:31:44,913
You can't do this.

1495
01:31:44,947 --> 01:31:46,984
Nobody wants to die, Nathan,
and, yes, I can.

1496
01:31:47,018 --> 01:31:48,986
In 50 seconds.

1497
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:51,264
I'm begging you. Please!

1498
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,887
No, no, no, still nothing
coming through.

1499
01:31:53,922 --> 01:31:56,165
Uh, it happens.

1500
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,201
Why are you doing this?

1501
01:31:57,235 --> 01:31:58,858
-40 seconds.
-Please.

1502
01:31:58,892 --> 01:32:00,584
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1503
01:32:00,618 --> 01:32:03,552
Yeah, that's what you said.
Consequences, right, Alice?

1504
01:32:03,587 --> 01:32:04,829
I didn't mean for it to happen.

1505
01:32:04,864 --> 01:32:06,693
I was just coming home
from work.

1506
01:32:06,728 --> 01:32:09,731
I-I had just gotten laid off,
for real.

1507
01:32:09,765 --> 01:32:11,664
Boo-hoo. 30 seconds.

1508
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:13,597
I-I was just coming
down the road, not even fast.

1509
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:15,253
I don't think
I even had a stop sign.

1510
01:32:15,288 --> 01:32:17,186
Oh, please, you do not
want to tick me off

1511
01:32:17,221 --> 01:32:18,325
more than you already have with

1512
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,673
"I don't think
I had a stop sign."

1513
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:22,122
And quite frankly,
I don't buy your whole

1514
01:32:22,157 --> 01:32:24,055
"I got laid off" sob story.

1515
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:26,679
It's true, I was.
So I was, I was distracted.

1516
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:29,060
I don't know.
I was thinking about the baby.

1517
01:32:29,095 --> 01:32:30,268
How I'm gonna take care of it.

1518
01:32:30,303 --> 01:32:32,374
It was just an accident.

1519
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:35,032
-20 seconds.
-Please.

1520
01:32:35,066 --> 01:32:38,380
Did you even bother to check
on her after you hit her?

1521
01:32:38,414 --> 01:32:40,865
Of course.
It was horrible.

1522
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,211
Sh-She wasn't moving.

1523
01:32:42,246 --> 01:32:44,973
And still, you just
left her there, huh?

1524
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:47,907
Like roadkill.

1525
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:50,288
Who are you? What kind of man
does something like that?

1526
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:51,807
I panicked.

1527
01:32:51,842 --> 01:32:53,947
Yeah, 'cause you got
a baby coming.

1528
01:32:53,982 --> 01:32:57,641
Got to be honest with you, kid's
gonna be better off without you.

1529
01:32:57,675 --> 01:33:01,886
I thought if-if I go to
somebody, if-if I told someone,

1530
01:33:01,921 --> 01:33:04,958
the-the police, everything
would change in an instant.

1531
01:33:04,993 --> 01:33:07,651
Nothing would ever be
the same again. And my wife?

1532
01:33:07,685 --> 01:33:10,067
It all just happened so fast,
so, yeah,

1533
01:33:10,101 --> 01:33:11,655
I panicked and I left.

1534
01:33:11,689 --> 01:33:14,278
It was wrong! I was wrong!

1535
01:33:14,312 --> 01:33:16,038
And the longer I-I didn't
do anything about it,

1536
01:33:16,073 --> 01:33:18,040
the more I couldn't
because it would only

1537
01:33:18,075 --> 01:33:20,146
make things worse
because I left.

1538
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,251
I'm sorry.
And I tried to go to you.

1539
01:33:22,286 --> 01:33:25,151
And I couldn't even do that.
I'm sorry!

1540
01:33:25,185 --> 01:33:27,394
All right?
But that's all I got!

1541
01:33:29,465 --> 01:33:31,295
Yeah, that's right.

1542
01:33:35,886 --> 01:33:37,612
Time's up.

1543
01:33:42,133 --> 01:33:44,308
Put down the gun, Joe.

1544
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:48,623
Cutting it kind of close
there, Detective.

1545
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:58,046
I... I think I could've
actually shot him.

1546
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,703
You don't want to tell me that.

1547
01:33:59,737 --> 01:34:01,912
Put the gun down.

1548
01:34:04,328 --> 01:34:06,951
Put the gun down slowly.

1549
01:34:21,345 --> 01:34:24,210
Nathan?

1550
01:34:26,005 --> 01:34:27,800
I'm sorry.

1551
01:34:27,834 --> 01:34:29,767
What did you do, Nathan?

1552
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:35,117
Nathan.

1553
01:34:49,753 --> 01:34:52,307
You could've said
something... King.

1554
01:35:25,029 --> 01:35:27,376
I am sorry.

1555
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:28,550
Stupid.

1556
01:35:28,584 --> 01:35:30,517
-Yeah.
-All of it.

1557
01:35:34,073 --> 01:35:36,385
She deserves better than me.

1558
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:39,354
They all deserve better than us.

1559
01:35:40,976 --> 01:35:42,771
Look, kid.

1560
01:35:42,806 --> 01:35:46,292
I know why you did what you did,
to protect her.

1561
01:35:46,326 --> 01:35:48,328
I get that.

1562
01:35:48,363 --> 01:35:51,331
I just wish it hadn't been
at the expense of my wife.

1563
01:35:55,301 --> 01:35:57,199
We had a son.

1564
01:35:57,234 --> 01:36:00,271
He died suddenly.

1565
01:36:00,306 --> 01:36:02,895
Man,
I just got sucker punched.

1566
01:36:02,929 --> 01:36:05,380
Put me right over the edge.

1567
01:36:07,485 --> 01:36:09,418
So I disappeared.

1568
01:36:11,938 --> 01:36:13,837
One day, Alice--

1569
01:36:13,871 --> 01:36:17,806
That was her name, by the way,
in case you missed that.

1570
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:19,843
She sits me down,
looks at me point-blank,

1571
01:36:19,877 --> 01:36:21,430
and says that
if we're gonna survive,

1572
01:36:21,465 --> 01:36:23,432
I'm gonna have to make a choice.

1573
01:36:23,467 --> 01:36:28,058
I can keep staring down
at my feet or I can...

1574
01:36:28,092 --> 01:36:30,370
I can look up at the stars.

1575
01:36:30,405 --> 01:36:32,338
That simple.

1576
01:36:34,409 --> 01:36:36,514
Course, I, uh, came back
with a joke.

1577
01:36:36,549 --> 01:36:40,415
I said, "It's daytime, dummy.

1578
01:36:40,449 --> 01:36:41,934
There are no stars."

1579
01:36:41,968 --> 01:36:43,452
She shot right back at me,

1580
01:36:43,487 --> 01:36:45,213
"Just 'cause you cant
see them right now

1581
01:36:45,247 --> 01:36:47,905
doesn't mean they're not up
there, dummy."

1582
01:36:51,012 --> 01:36:54,429
I guess this business of life
has always been pretty, um,

1583
01:36:54,463 --> 01:36:57,052
"what you see
is what you get" for me.

1584
01:36:59,123 --> 01:37:02,920
We come into this world, we work
our way through it, we move on.

1585
01:37:02,955 --> 01:37:05,233
Have a couple of laughs
along the way.

1586
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,413
You know the truth?

1587
01:37:15,519 --> 01:37:17,245
Sad reality?

1588
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:22,526
Her ability to deal with
all this kind of crap

1589
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,185
that life throws at you,
all this...

1590
01:37:28,428 --> 01:37:31,155
...I knew where it came from.

1591
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:32,501
Always.

1592
01:37:32,536 --> 01:37:34,227
And it ju-- it would burn me up.

1593
01:37:34,262 --> 01:37:36,885
I'd resent her because
I knew it was connected

1594
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:40,026
to some... goodness...

1595
01:37:42,615 --> 01:37:46,584
...that I was, I was
never able to buy into.

1596
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:50,071
And she... she could so easily.

1597
01:37:57,216 --> 01:38:00,081
What are you saying?

1598
01:38:00,115 --> 01:38:02,911
Heck if I know.

1599
01:38:10,194 --> 01:38:12,714
-You should keep him.
-Hmm?

1600
01:38:12,748 --> 01:38:15,406
Dog. Or whatever
you want to call him.

1601
01:38:15,441 --> 01:38:18,375
At least for now.
It would be one less worry.

1602
01:38:20,446 --> 01:38:23,552
You're assuming all this
is gonna blow over for me.

1603
01:38:23,587 --> 01:38:25,485
We share blame here.

1604
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,350
And I'm the one
who pulled the gun.

1605
01:38:28,385 --> 01:38:30,697
An empty gun.

1606
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:32,941
They're not gonna do
anything to you.

1607
01:38:32,976 --> 01:38:36,911
Well, if it works out that way,
maybe till you're sorted.

1608
01:38:42,606 --> 01:38:45,195
Did you really get fired?

1609
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:47,680
-That day?
-Oh, yeah.

1610
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:50,372
What kind of work you do?

1611
01:38:50,407 --> 01:38:52,064
Paint.

1612
01:38:52,098 --> 01:38:54,549
You know, houses.

1613
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:56,723
Huh.

1614
01:38:56,758 --> 01:38:59,209
So what did you do
to get dumped?

1615
01:38:59,243 --> 01:39:00,417
Truth?

1616
01:39:00,451 --> 01:39:02,695
Oh, now, now he starts.

1617
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:05,525
I hated the people
I worked with.

1618
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,564
I got into a thing with one of
them, one of those know-it-alls.

1619
01:39:09,598 --> 01:39:11,255
Only he didn't know anything.

1620
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:12,981
He just walked around all day
motor mouthing.

1621
01:39:13,016 --> 01:39:16,364
I know the type.

1622
01:39:16,398 --> 01:39:18,366
Sometimes it takes all you got
not to punch them down

1623
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,471
just to teach them a lesson.

1624
01:39:20,506 --> 01:39:22,094
Yeah.

1625
01:39:22,128 --> 01:39:23,612
Might serve you well

1626
01:39:23,647 --> 01:39:25,994
to keep that thought
to yourself and, uh,

1627
01:39:26,029 --> 01:39:28,307
you'll work your way through it,
you and your wife.

1628
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:34,485
She must've been
an incredible woman, Alice.

1629
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,487
She was.

1630
01:39:36,522 --> 01:39:38,593
Pure love.

1631
01:39:40,664 --> 01:39:45,013
I think maybe I see some of that
in your girl there.

1632
01:40:07,415 --> 01:40:09,348
I think...

1633
01:40:09,382 --> 01:40:13,662
I think Alice would want me
to say, um...

1634
01:40:13,697 --> 01:40:16,148
that I forgive you.

1635
01:40:18,564 --> 01:40:20,462
Do you?

1636
01:40:20,497 --> 01:40:22,775
I don't know.

1637
01:40:25,364 --> 01:40:27,469
It's a work in progress.

1638
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:31,232
Yeah.

1639
01:40:33,372 --> 01:40:36,064
How come you're being
so okay about all this?

1640
01:40:36,099 --> 01:40:40,413
You think that's
what this is, me being okay?

1641
01:40:40,448 --> 01:40:42,381
I'm not okay.

1642
01:40:45,349 --> 01:40:47,869
You two gentlemen
simmered down yet?

1643
01:40:47,903 --> 01:40:50,837
Yeah. We're simmered.

1644
01:40:53,288 --> 01:40:55,187
Good luck, kid.
