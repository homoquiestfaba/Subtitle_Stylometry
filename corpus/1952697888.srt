1
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,282
Stop.

2
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,909
This is coming down.

3
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,869
What? Why?

4
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,540
No, I love the idea of the mirror
on the ceiling, but that's just ugly.

5
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,584
But the thing is, you look beautiful in it.

6
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,588
Now, see, if we're gonna take it down,
we gotta at least try it out...

7
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,841
christen the new house.

8
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,010
And what do you suggest we use
for a bed?

9
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,974
We don't need a bed, because we got
this fine carpet right here.

10
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:08,063
So I guess we'll have fine carpet
tattoos all over our asses.

11
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,439
Wait, baby,
don't you have to go to work?

12
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,526
I don't want any 30-second nookie.

13
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,864
I told them I'd be late. Now what?

14
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,574
- What about the movers?
- The movers?

15
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:22,201
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be here in an hour.

16
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,579
Which is just enough time.

17
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,082
Derek. You are so bad.

18
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,585
Like that isn't why you married me?

19
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,129
What about Kyle?

20
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,884
He'll be all right.
That boy will sleep through anything.

21
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,184
Gage Bendix?

22
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:28,728
Excuse me?

23
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,564
I couldn't help but notice
we were both going to 22.

24
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,817
Gage Bendix, yeah. I work there.

25
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,945
I thought that you might.

26
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,323
You have an appointment with us?

27
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,827
Why, do I look like a client?

28
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:45,995
Actually, you do.

29
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:50,332
Well, well, I hate to shatter the illusion,
but I'm a temp.

30
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,210
You're a temp?

31
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,462
Girl's gotta pay the rent.

32
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,257
I would've never guessed a temp.

33
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,348
Let me help you out.

34
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,601
There you go.

35
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,901
There you go.

36
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,989
Thanks. I owe you one.

37
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,999
- Good morning.
- Morning.

38
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:36,795
Are you following me?

39
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,049
No, I'm taking these files
to Mr. Charles's office.

40
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,593
- Derek Charles?
- Yeah, I guess you probably know him.

41
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,887
Yeah, I know who he is
and he's an asshole.

42
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:48,349
Takes himself way too seriously.
But don't tell him I said that, okay?

43
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,809
- I could get you in trouble?
- Oh, yeah. Big trouble.

44
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,645
My lips are sealed.

45
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,147
- Patrick.
- Good morning, Derek.

46
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,815
- Hey.
- How's the new house?

47
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,152
Chaos, man, chaos. I got out
just as the movers showed up.

48
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,612
Sharon must have loved that.

49
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:04,073
Yeah, if she calls mad,
you tell her I'm in a meeting.

50
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,700
Hey. Remember who used to sit
at this desk, huh?

51
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,703
She'll know I'm lying.

52
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:11,497
Can I help you?

53
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,999
That's Derek Charles?

54
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,667
Yes.

55
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,671
Better watch out, girl, he's married.

56
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,883
- The good ones are always married.
- Right. Or straight.

57
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,678
Did you talk to our German friend,
Herr Ganz?

58
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,013
Actually, I just got off the phone
with him.

59
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,682
- And?
- He doesn't like the way...

60
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,686
the stock market's gyrating, thinks
the hedge-fund wave is about to crest.

61
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,313
- You think he's right?
- No, no. I don't think he's right.

62
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:37,690
He's wrong. You know Ganz.

63
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,234
He gets paranoid when
anything goes mainstream.

64
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,652
So he makes a lot of noise...

65
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:45,907
but I managed to talk him into
a private-equity portfolio instead.

66
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:48,618
To the tune of 155 million.

67
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:53,414
I want you to throw Derek
your support on this.

68
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:55,583
I am just honoured
to exist in Derek's world.

69
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:57,084
Whose legs are those?

70
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,879
- Never seen them before.
- I think she's a new temp.

71
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,780
I think you mean temptress.

72
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,449
Always nice to have a girl
around the office, isn't it?

73
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,494
Derek married the last eye candy
we had, took her off the market.

74
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:10,706
Yes, sir. Miss us a little
Sharon around here.

75
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,208
I don't think you do.

76
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,878
- Patrick, forward my calls.
- Will do.

77
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,673
- Okay. Good night, Marge.
- Bye, Derek.

78
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:24,136
D, you cutting out early? I grabbed us
a couple tickets to the Lakers tonight.

79
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,429
You're killing me. I'm moving.

80
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,014
- I gotta get home.
- So?

81
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:29,308
So do I look like a man
who wants to get a divorce?

82
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,810
Why don't I call her and say we got
a work emergency? Come on.

83
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,854
- No, thanks, I'll stay married.
- Coward.

84
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:35,731
Yeah.

85
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,734
Goodbye, Mr. Charles.

86
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,032
- You punked me.
- I'm sorry, but you set me up.

87
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,701
I'll get my revenge.
You might like to know...

88
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:51,079
- that everybody disagrees with you.
- About what?

89
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,373
About Derek Charles
being an asshole.

90
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:55,292
They say he's the nicest guy
in the firm.

91
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,169
Yeah, well, I've got them fooled.

92
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,754
I'm Lisa, by the way.

93
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,548
Hey, Lisa By The Way.

94
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:03,759
Good luck at your next job.

95
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,136
Hold the door, please.

96
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,180
They're keeping me on
for a few more days...

97
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,350
so I might see you on Monday.

98
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,878
Sharon!

99
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,004
Your turn.

100
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,048
No, I think it's your turn!

101
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,342
Don't even try it.
It's definitely your turn.

102
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,135
Looks like I'm stuck, huh?

103
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,845
Huh, Kyle?

104
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,890
Come here.

105
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:54,935
Oh, my God.
What is your mom feeding you?

106
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:37,478
What do you think about giving
that magic mirror another test drive?

107
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,022
Sharon, you're so bad.

108
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,691
Like that's not why you married me.

109
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:50,533
- Morning, Marge.
- Morning, Derek.

110
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,121
Hi.

111
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,748
Remember me?

112
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:02,753
Lisa By The Way, right?

113
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:05,506
Very good, I'm impressed.

114
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:10,268
Hey, Marge, where's Patrick?

115
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,553
Out with the flu.

116
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,513
I did some trading
with the other temps...

117
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:15,766
and I wrangled your desk.

118
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,227
I hope that's okay.

119
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,816
No, that's fine. Why don't you
grab a pad and a pen, follow me?

120
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,201
Here's a memo
for the Christmas party this Friday.

121
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:36,579
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

122
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,693
Sit down.

123
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,533
So why don't they invite spouses?

124
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:52,452
What?

125
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:54,746
To the party. It says no spouses.

126
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:59,209
Yeah, it's Joe Gage's rule. Actually,
it's like that at a lot of companies.

127
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,295
I guess they figure you're not gonna
kick back and let loose...

128
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:05,590
if your spouse is there.
The reason of having the party, right?

129
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,844
- So does this party get pretty wild?
- Oh, not usually.

130
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,220
Well, that's no fun.

131
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:13,599
I called Patrick. He said that
you like it black with 2 sugars.

132
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:17,143
If it's cold, I can go nuke it
in the kitchen.

133
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:20,271
No, actually, it's perfect. Thank you
very much. Let's get started.

134
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,107
- Ready when you are.
- It's Monday.

135
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,068
- First things first.
- Took care of that.

136
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:26,528
Took care of what?

137
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,780
On Mondays you always
send your wife flowers.

138
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,117
This week you sent her a dozen
long-stemmed red roses.

139
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,369
I called to confirm
they've been delivered.

140
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,246
Thank you.

141
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,709
So how long have you two
been married?

142
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,169
3 years in March.

143
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,755
And you still send her flowers
every week. Lucky girl.

144
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:48,675
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

145
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:52,137
Patrick said that you started back
when she was your assistant.

146
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,222
You and Patrick had quite
a conversation.

147
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,890
- Let's run some calls.
- Fire away.

148
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:57,976
Why don't we start
with Phil Trendle?

149
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,270
See if you can get a lunch
appointment next week...

150
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,856
but push for The Water Grill.
I like the fish.

151
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:05,150
- The Water Grill's fantastic.
- Terry Mills.

152
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,362
- Am I going too fast?
- I'm just waiting on you.

153
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,239
Are you always this efficient?

154
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,866
Does that surprise you?

155
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,326
Yeah. Yeah, most of the temps
we get here, they're like-

156
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,205
I think you'll find
I'm not your typical temp.

157
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,326
<i>We were at the grocery store,</i>

158
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,962
I look over and Kyle is flirting
with the checkout girl.

159
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:29,674
<i>She's about 16, and he's 2.</i>

160
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,511
<i>He was giving her the same look
you give when you see a pretty girl.</i>

161
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:37,474
<i>I think you've been teaching my baby
how to flirt. Like father, like son.</i>

162
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,935
<i>So, anyway, on the way home,
I stopped by campus today...</i>

163
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:45,106
<i>and I picked up a catalogue
for next semester's curriculum.</i>

164
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,734
<i>Let me tell you, I cannot wait.</i>

165
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,736
Do you need me?

166
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:54,407
<i>I'm gonna show it to you tonight.
I need your opinion on my courses.</i>

167
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:56,243
Are you listening to me?

168
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:05,668
Baby.

169
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,922
If I bundle Managerial Economics
and Operations Management...

170
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,424
then I won't take Management
Information Systems...

171
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:13,760
until next semester, right?

172
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:14,886
School?

173
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,846
- Derek.
- It's like an online degree?

174
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:19,808
Come on, baby, not tonight.
You know this is important to me.

175
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,393
Well, it's important to me too...

176
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:25,397
but I was kind of hoping you liked
being a mom, staying home with Kyle.

177
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,191
You know I love being a mom.

178
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,612
We got all this room. I make
enough money for you and I to-

179
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,572
It's not about the money.

180
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,740
We had an agreement.

181
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,327
You said that you'd work hard, I'd have
the baby, you'd get your promotion.

182
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,412
Then I'd get my degree.

183
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,080
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

184
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,666
You have something to talk about
when you get home.

185
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,334
I need some things to talk about.

186
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:49,421
- So Kyle's gonna be an only child?
- Let's get him a puppy.

187
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,198
A female that looks
like your side of the family...

188
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,284
- and tell him it's his sister.
- Can we call her Little Sharon?

189
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,744
Hey, Little Sharon. Come here.

190
00:14:56,745 --> 00:14:59,580
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

191
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:04,210
You know what, I wanna see you
say that in front of her face.

192
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,174
D? Why didn't you
call me back today?

193
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,343
- What time did you call?
- Around 4.

194
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,764
- You should leave a message.
- I did leave a message.

195
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:19,100
Oh, Patrick was sick,
and, you know, the temp-

196
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,977
We had a temp and she said...

197
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:23,563
Shannon called but didn't leave a number.

198
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:27,150
She? I thought we had an agreement,
no female assistants.

199
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,861
Baby, I don't control
temp availability.

200
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,404
Is she pretty?

201
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,489
Pretty plain.

202
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,784
Actually, you know what,
she did a better job than Patrick.

203
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,494
Except for messing up
your message.

204
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,913
- I want her fired immediately.
- Immediately.

205
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:43,500
- I'm serious.
- I promise.

206
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,797
Good night, Shannon.

207
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,344
Hope we're not interrupting
anything.

208
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,638
No, no, it's a treat to have you here.

209
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,683
I'm taking Kyle to The Grove today
to see Santa.

210
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:04,228
You wanna come?
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?

211
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,063
No, I would, but I'm swamped.

212
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,149
You need me back in the office,
don't you?

213
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,735
Excuse me.
Here's your coffee, freshly nuked.

214
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,488
Hey, Lisa.

215
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:17,825
This is my wife, Sharon. Sharon,
this is Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.

216
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,536
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

217
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:23,456
- Hi.
- Hi. And this must be Kyle.

218
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:26,417
I can already tell
he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

219
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,045
Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa.

220
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,338
Say hi, Kyle.

221
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:33,841
Oh, he can say hello. He's usually
not this shy around strangers.

222
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:37,304
What a handsome boy.
He looks just like you.

223
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:38,972
You think so?

224
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:41,766
Most people think he looks
like the beautiful Sharon.

225
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,434
Talk about the perfect family.

226
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,187
The 3 of you should be
on the cover of a magazine.

227
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,773
It's a good thing you won't be here
too long.

228
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,025
I know my husband
can be very demanding.

229
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,444
Actually, I'm learning a lot
from your husband.

230
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,031
I bet you are.

231
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,868
Joe Gage needs to see you
when you have a moment.

232
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,454
Great.

233
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,997
It's nice to meet you, Sharon.

234
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:06,458
You too, Liz.

235
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,501
- It's Lisa.
- Excuse me?

236
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:10,586
It's Lisa. You said Liz.

237
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:13,923
Sorry. Lisa.

238
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,639
- Sharon.
- Wasn't me. Blame Shannon.

239
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,808
- What's the deal with her?
- What do you mean?

240
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,644
" Looks just like you, Derek. "

241
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,396
But he is kind of handsome like me.

242
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,814
You said she was plain.

243
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,066
That girl may be a lot,
but she ain't plain.

244
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:35,361
I wouldn't know.
I only have eyes for you.

245
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,864
And you really think
that's gonna work?

246
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:39,574
Come on.

247
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,909
Take you around the office.
You can see the gang.

248
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,578
I know that you must miss it.

249
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:46,665
- When is Patrick coming back?
- Tomorrow.

250
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,250
You better hope so.

251
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,720
Crudo.

252
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,034
Wow, look at the tree.

253
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:07,287
Christmas already.

254
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:11,374
- Hey, Stan.
- Good morning, Mr. Charles.

255
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,709
- I'm back.
- Patrick.

256
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,545
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

257
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:18,464
You know it's gonna take a lot more
than some stomach bug...

258
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,591
to keep me away from
that Christmas party.

259
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,634
Yeah.

260
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:25,388
Not sure we can say the same
for Marge.

261
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,125
You get around, don't you?

262
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,462
Poor girl called in sick
with the stomach bug.

263
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,880
She caught it from Patrick.

264
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:37,383
That's what she gets
for using my lip gloss.

265
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,888
All right, girls.
Behave yourselves out here.

266
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:48,769
So how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek's calls?

267
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,688
As if you don't.

268
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,690
I'm way too smooth
to ever get caught.

269
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,150
- I bet you are.
- How long have you been here?

270
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,361
- 10 years in April.
- I bet you know more...

271
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,947
about what happens behind
these doors than anybody.

272
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,991
Sweetie, you have no idea.

273
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,410
My nickname around here is 411.

274
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,872
411. Well, maybe we can grab
a cocktail after work sometime.

275
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,623
You can catch me up with girl talk.

276
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:13,377
If you think you can pump me for
information with a couple of Cosmos...

277
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,296
you're right.

278
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:36,901
I'm sorry, I thought everyone
was at lunch.

279
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,154
- I should go.
- No.

280
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,114
You stay. Okay?

281
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,952
I'm gonna just grab my lunch and...

282
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:49,497
head on back to my office.

283
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,125
Okay?

284
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,885
- You okay? You wanna talk about it?
- It's nothing.

285
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,804
Nothing?

286
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:11,018
You know, most people I know
don't cry over nothing.

287
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,354
You think I'm crying?

288
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,105
This is just allergies.

289
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,900
Oh, allergies, okay.
What are you allergic to?

290
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,613
Men, apparently.

291
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,657
Can I sit down?

292
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,286
Yeah.

293
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:34,208
You having boyfriend troubles
right now?

294
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,838
I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with me.

295
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,716
There's nothing wrong with you.

296
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,552
I wish I could believe that.

297
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,477
Maybe you haven't met
the right guy yet.

298
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,396
I'm beginning to think
all the good ones are taken.

299
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,107
I'm no expert, but, you know,
if it didn't work out...

300
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,985
then maybe it wasn't meant to be.

301
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,820
Maybe.

302
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,906
And then, you know,
you're gonna meet the right guy...

303
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,491
you'll know immediately.

304
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,786
Is that how it was
with you and Sharon?

305
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,705
Yeah. Yeah, it does happen.

306
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,459
- Great. Now I'm jealous.
- Why?

307
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,878
She has everything.

308
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,006
Perfect husband, perfect child,
perfect marriage.

309
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,050
No. No, nothing's perfect.

310
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:27,636
You know, there are problems
in every relationship.

311
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,680
The most important thing
is to move forward.

312
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,183
You gotta keep moving forward,
you know?

313
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,020
Hey, Lisa, look, don't beat yourself up
over this guy.

314
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,507
Look at you, you're a bright,
attractive woman.

315
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:42,467
Any man would be lucky
to have you.

316
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:43,802
Yeah, right.

317
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:47,181
No. Honestly, if I were single...

318
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,266
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

319
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,976
Is it working?

320
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,854
Yes.

321
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:55,772
Good.

322
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,858
You hang in there, okay?

323
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,904
It's gonna be just fine.

324
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:03,822
Thanks, Derek.

325
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:07,660
Mister- Mr. Charles.

326
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,999
I'm sorry, excuse me.

327
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,877
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

328
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,339
What was that all about?

329
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,508
Oh, man, her boyfriend dumped her
and I was being nice.

330
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:26,678
I'll take up that slack.
That is one smoking hot piece of ass.

331
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:28,889
- Stop it, Ben.
- Come on. Like you haven't noticed.

332
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,933
No, dude,
I'm not in the game anymore.

333
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,227
I'm retired and coaching, as are you.

334
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,855
I'm still in the game. I'm just
on the bench, waiting to play again.

335
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:38,774
Careful, D.
It's not like the old days...

336
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:42,236
where you could get away with
office nookie and not get nailed for it.

337
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,403
Careful, D?

338
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,405
You went and married yours,
that's all.

339
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,115
If you're thinking of that girl-

340
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:49,034
- You saw her first.
- You are a fool.

341
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:53,080
Sadly, I don't think I'm her type.
Now, you, on the other hand...

342
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:56,166
All I'm saying
is that these single gals...

343
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,460
see the workplace
as their hunting ground.

344
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:02,882
And I think this one has got you
in her cross hairs.

345
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,455
Sharon. Hey.

346
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:20,876
I just put him to sleep, baby.

347
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,254
Red? Blue?

348
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:25,798
- Red? Blue?
- The red one.

349
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:34,640
- What you doing tonight?
- The usual. Formula, oatmeal.

350
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,267
How do I look?

351
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,519
- You look all right.
- I look all right.

352
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,232
Remember the last time you went
to that party and got drunk.

353
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,217
Kyle.

354
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,053
Eat something.

355
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:51,139
I will. I'm gonna grab a burger
at Jake's.

356
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,935
- Okay. I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

357
00:25:55,728 --> 00:26:00,899
4th quarter, Derek Charles
puts it up, 3 seconds to go.

358
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:06,697
- I love you, baby.
- Bye. Eat something, baby.

359
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:37,602
- This seat taken?
- Yeah.

360
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:39,104
No, I'm kidding.

361
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,106
Be my guest.

362
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,778
- Look at you.
- It's a Christmas party.

363
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,363
Oh, yeah. You look great.

364
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:51,241
Thank you.
You grabbing a bite before?

365
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,575
Yeah. You too?

366
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:54,160
Brilliant minds think alike.

367
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:57,038
Thank you, John.
Still the best burger in town.

368
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,749
Really?

369
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,001
Hey, John? John?

370
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:03,169
John.

371
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,757
- Can I have one too?
- Fix her up. The special.

372
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,348
- That was delicious.
- I told you.

373
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:20,061
You know, we used to come back here
after a hard day's work and cut loose.

374
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,396
- Work hard, play hard?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:24,817
Back in the day,
I would throw them back too.

376
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,611
Hey, how's your boyfriend trouble?

377
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,697
- Keep moving forward, right?
- Exactly.

378
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:34,743
- All right.
- So, what's the grand plan, Derek?

379
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,828
Run the company by 35...

380
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:41,166
jet by 40, retire on my private island
and own the Lakers by 50.

381
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,501
- I'm a Sixers fan.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

382
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,171
I'll bring you around to my team,
okay?

383
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:48,757
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

384
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:51,217
Can-? Can I please have
a dirty martini?

385
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:52,427
Sure.

386
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:54,763
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

387
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,099
Oh, come on. Big talker.

388
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,225
No, thanks.

389
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:03,355
- It's Christmas time. Work's dead.
- John, no.

390
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:06,692
- Bring one for my friend.
- How dirty do you want it?

391
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,694
Make it filthy.

392
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:14,324
This is for you.

393
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:23,249
Patrick? Patrick. Patrick.

394
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,861
Once again, great job as the head
of the decoration committee.

395
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:31,616
- You're like Santa's Little Helper.
- Well, I wouldn't let your people do it.

396
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,912
Hey, don't try this at home, huh?
You'll hurt yourself.

397
00:28:43,212 --> 00:28:44,545
What's up?

398
00:28:44,546 --> 00:28:46,506
What's going on?
You look beautiful.

399
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,426
I'll be right back.

400
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,386
I'm coming for you, Derek.

401
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:54,806
- I'm coming for you.
- No. I don't dance.

402
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:57,600
No, come on, you don't wanna
with me. Okay, okay.

403
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,603
Yeah. All right.

404
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:03,272
- Is this you, Marge?
- That's me.

405
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:05,984
Let me get some of that boogie.

406
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,279
- Didn't know you could move like that.
- Because I'm stuck behind a desk.

407
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,492
- Okay, you do have legs under there.
- Oh, yes, I do.

408
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:21,082
- All right. You are smooth.
- Smooth, baby, real smooth.

409
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,792
- Really smooth.
- I'm coming in.

410
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:25,670
All righty, baby. He's all yours.

411
00:29:27,131 --> 00:29:30,466
- Hey, Office Asshole.
- That's Mr. Office Asshole to you.

412
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:31,968
Tequila?

413
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:36,013
Beer, 3 martinis, and tequila?
No, I don't think so.

414
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:37,974
Coward.

415
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,524
Bring it on.

416
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:48,651
You've got the moves.

417
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:51,029
That's Soul Train for you, baby.

418
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,947
- What you got?
- Wanna see what I got?

419
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:55,534
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bring it.

420
00:29:56,618 --> 00:29:58,911
You got some moves. Okay, temp.

421
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,873
- Nasty, nasty.
- Hey.

422
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:04,292
You know,
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

423
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,127
Why not?

424
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:09,756
I haven't been here that long and...

425
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:13,552
I'm sure everybody here is happy
that you showed up.

426
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:16,345
Even you?

427
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:20,225
What do you mean, "even me"?
I'm your biggest supporter here.

428
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:29,901
You wanna put one on the cheek?

429
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:36,575
If you don't, people will
really think something's going on.

430
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:41,788
Well, we're gonna have
to take that chance then, huh?

431
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,958
Whoa, where you going?

432
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:49,420
This evening's just getting started.
Sally Sloane. We got Sally Sloane.

433
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:51,381
You remember her?
She gave us lap dances!

434
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,091
- Sally.
- Derek has singles!

435
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,885
- He has singles!
- I gotta go home, sober up.

436
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:57,970
You wanna get out of here and go
find yourself some new trouble?

437
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:01,265
- No, thank you. No, thank you.
- Where is your holiday spirit?

438
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:03,101
With my wife and kid.

439
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:06,646
Gotta take a leak, then I'm sneaking
out of here, all right?

440
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,941
You're no fun, D. No fun at all.

441
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,034
Lisa, Lisa.

442
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:23,996
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

443
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,874
Come on, stop, no.

444
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,630
Fuck.

445
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:40,722
You need to stop it.

446
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,061
Who's there?

447
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:50,565
Stop. Okay. Okay.

448
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:54,844
Lisa, Lisa.

449
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:59,182
Oh, God, Lisa, Lisa. Stop. Stop.
Don't do that. Don't...

450
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:04,729
Stop, stop.

451
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:16,407
Lisa, stop.

452
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:19,160
Stop.

453
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,668
Stop.

454
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:29,587
Stop it.

455
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:34,091
- What? Derek.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

456
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:37,428
What's wrong? Derek!

457
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:48,230
If you don't feel like you can drive,
I have cab vouchers.

458
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:51,358
Cab vouchers for anybody
who can't drive. Don't want you hurt.

459
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,653
Come on, don't be shy.

460
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:02,161
Freak.

461
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:10,169
Well, well, well.
Living dangerously, aren't we?

462
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,839
Patrick, you silly old queen.

463
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:15,216
Dance with me.

464
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,469
Dance with me.

465
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,050
How was it?

466
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,887
The usual, baby.

467
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,598
Anything interesting happen?

468
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:49,686
No.

469
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:08,996
Good morning.

470
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:10,915
Hey. Morning.

471
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:13,901
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

472
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:16,278
Man, you should've stayed.

473
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:19,281
Roger from Acquisitions tossed
his cookies on the Christmas tree.

474
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:21,075
Sorry I missed that.

475
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:31,669
Bad time?

476
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:35,047
No.

477
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:38,509
Joe wants to know when you'll
be done with the Ganz portfolio.

478
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,803
Tell him I'll have it to him
by the end of the day.

479
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,355
Thanks.

480
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:46,764
Sure.

481
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:55,994
Joe really likes the ladies, huh?

482
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:00,515
I- I wouldn't know.

483
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,157
Hey. All right if I take off?

484
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:21,076
- Yeah. Go home.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

485
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:22,870
Okay.

486
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:24,664
Hey, Lisa.

487
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,037
Hey.

488
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,375
I owe you an apology
for the Christmas party.

489
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:13,712
I think that I sort of took you
by surprise.

490
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:18,467
Yeah, you know,
we both had a few drinks.

491
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,428
So let's just forget about it.

492
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:23,598
What if I can't?

493
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:34,233
Lisa, nothing happened.

494
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:40,281
All right, have it your way.
Nothing happened.

495
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:44,786
All right, get out of my car.

496
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:47,330
Get out of my car right now.

497
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:50,792
Get out of my car.

498
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,376
Relax.

499
00:37:52,377 --> 00:37:55,129
- Derek, relax.
- Come on. Out of my car.

500
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,840
- Get out of here.
- No one's around to see us.

501
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,969
God. I almost went insane today.
Having to pretend...

502
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,097
like I was concentrating on work,
when all I could think about-

503
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:07,808
Lisa! Get out of my car now!

504
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:10,395
Derek, what's wrong?

505
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,980
- What did I do?
- Hey, hey.

506
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:15,733
I don't know what's wrong,
whether you're dense or what...

507
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:18,944
but let me tell you something.
There's nothing going on between us.

508
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:22,531
Nothing! Okay? I wouldn't jeopardise
my job. For chrissakes, I work here.

509
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:24,825
Stop! Don't touch me. Just get out.

510
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:28,437
Get out.

511
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:32,816
- Get out! Come on!
- God!

512
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:36,570
- Maybe you are an asshole.
- Yeah, all right. Get out.

513
00:39:07,936 --> 00:39:10,104
Sharon?

514
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,648
Shar?

515
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:17,528
Something I need to tell you.

516
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:24,576
What's wrong?

517
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:27,788
I spent the last hour and a half
talking my sister off the ledge.

518
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:29,873
- Sheila?
- Can you believe Tim's been having...

519
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:33,878
an affair with some random woman
at work for a year and a half?

520
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:37,297
- How did she find out?
- Tim just blurted it out.

521
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:40,634
He said he was leaving her.
With 3 kids.

522
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,971
- Yeah, that's tough.
- It's a disaster. If it were me-

523
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:47,266
No, that would never be you,
because I would never cheat on you.

524
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:49,226
I know.

525
00:39:51,062 --> 00:39:53,272
Tim is an asshole.

526
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,483
Tell me about it.

527
00:39:58,486 --> 00:40:01,238
So, what were you gonna tell me?

528
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,698
What?

529
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:05,409
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

530
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,621
No.

531
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:13,376
Just a problem at work.
Nothing I can't handle.

532
00:40:14,794 --> 00:40:17,254
Why didn't you tell me?

533
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,715
Honestly, there was nothing to tell.

534
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:22,885
She grabbed your package,
flashed you in your car.

535
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,803
Come on.
I thought we were best friends.

536
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:27,139
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me sooner.

537
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,600
- Ben, you think this is funny?
- Yes, I do.

538
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,853
I kind of thought maybe she was
into you a little. I just never figured-

539
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:35,647
I don't get it. You know, I...

540
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:37,524
Honestly, Ben.

541
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:40,444
" Hey, how are you?" I didn't-
I was just being nice.

542
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,321
That's all.

543
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:44,740
You sure you didn't lead her on?
Just a little?

544
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:48,703
- No. Not a goddamn thing. Honestly.
- That girl is hot.

545
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,415
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Report it to Human Resources.

546
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,291
You're gonna get her fired?

547
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:57,920
- I don't have a choice.
- Let's just be careful about this.

548
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:00,255
What if she says
that you came onto her?

549
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:01,465
No way.

550
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:04,051
We're talking history
of behaviour here, Derek.

551
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:07,221
When's the last time you had
a female assistant at your desk, huh?

552
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:08,848
People are gonna wonder.

553
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:22,152
- Morning, Mr. Charles.
- Hey.

554
00:41:22,153 --> 00:41:23,654
- Hank back there?
- Go right in.

555
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:26,198
- Hey, Hank.
- Derek, hey.

556
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,951
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

557
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:37,167
I have... I have a personal matter
I gotta talk to you about.

558
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:39,086
You know Lisa Sheridan, the temp?

559
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:41,755
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She worked your desk for a while.

560
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:44,800
Yeah, that's right. She did.

561
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,512
Hank, this is awkward, okay?

562
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:51,265
If you're here to file a complaint
about her performance...

563
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:52,683
you can save your breath.

564
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:55,185
Her agency called,
said she's not coming back in.

565
00:41:55,186 --> 00:41:57,229
They already sent a replacement.

566
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:00,466
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

567
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,969
They say why?

568
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:06,889
No.

569
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:10,934
Why, was there some sort
of problem?

570
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:12,394
Problem?

571
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:16,732
No. No problem. No problem.

572
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:22,654
I just thought she was way in
over her head, that's all.

573
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:26,116
- But if she already quit, then...
- She beat you to it.

574
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:27,701
Yeah.

575
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:33,540
Yeah.

576
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,837
- Was there anything else?
- No. Guess not.

577
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:41,381
- How's the new house?
- You know, couldn't be better.

578
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:43,049
- Tell Sharon I said hi.
- I will.

579
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,052
Actually, you guys should come by
once we settle down. Come by.

580
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:47,762
- That sounds great.
- All right.

581
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:50,015
- See you, Hank.
- Bye-bye.

582
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:56,605
- So?
- She quit.

583
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:57,981
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

584
00:42:57,982 --> 00:42:59,649
Do you have a horseshoe
up your ass?

585
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,818
You are the luckiest bastard I know.

586
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:03,028
Looks that way.

587
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:05,071
Not a bad early Christmas present.

588
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:07,366
All right.

589
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:33,350
Thank you.

590
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:36,186
Thank you. I'm getting
all these gifts. Look at this.

591
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:43,360
Friedrich?

592
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:46,071
Hey, it's Derek Charles.

593
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:50,159
Hey. How was your Christmas?

594
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,372
No, mine was great.
I had a great time with my family.

595
00:43:55,373 --> 00:43:58,792
No, I'm in the office working
for you right now.

596
00:43:58,793 --> 00:44:01,127
Absolutely. That's what we do.
That's what we do.

597
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:04,173
Hey, you take a look
at that prospectus for me?

598
00:44:06,217 --> 00:44:08,594
I told you.

599
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:10,554
I told you.

600
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:15,309
<i>Yeah. No, I think we're gonna
have a great New Year.</i>

601
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:25,110
Baby, it's after 3?

602
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:28,822
That's the last time I'm celebrating out
on New Years.

603
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:34,078
Next year, we'll celebrate at home.
Just you, me, and Kyle.

604
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,376
Aren't you gonna get that?

605
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,461
No. It'll wait till the morning.

606
00:44:43,462 --> 00:44:45,798
What if it's Ganz with the approval?

607
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,701
It's noon in Munich. Go on, lazy.

608
00:44:59,378 --> 00:45:01,212
Ganz?

609
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:02,714
No.

610
00:45:20,858 --> 00:45:22,400
What was that?

611
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:27,072
Nothing. I just gotta get a
new spam blocker.

612
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:14,118
And then Joe was like:

613
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,206
"Oh, we're not drinking. This is a
retreat. We're gonna stay sober.

614
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:19,999
Do some bonding. "

615
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,877
If Joe said that, he must've
been drunk at the time.

616
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:26,005
Right? So I'll call you later
and check on you and Kyle.

617
00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:27,507
Okay.

618
00:46:31,804 --> 00:46:35,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lap dance. Lap
dance. Who brought up lap dance?

619
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:38,977
This is- This is a business retreat.
This is work.

620
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:41,896
We are clocked in.
Unless it was Joe's idea.

621
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:44,399
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
so it must've been mine.

622
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,276
All righty. Well, then,
let's see a show of hands...

623
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:50,780
of who wants to see
some hot, oily breasts...

624
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:53,658
being jammed into their faces?
Derek, are you in?

625
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:55,034
I'm a married man.

626
00:46:55,035 --> 00:46:57,036
- I don't have to pay for it.
- You're paying.

627
00:46:57,037 --> 00:46:58,955
- You just don't know it yet.
- Hear, hear.

628
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:01,457
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's this?

629
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,667
A dirty martini.

630
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:06,171
- No, I didn't...
- It's from the lady at the bar.

631
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:10,258
<i>I do have to say I'm kind of a fan
of the waitress staff around here.</i>

632
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:11,495
<i>We should hit one of those clubs.</i>

633
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,534
Derek, are you okay?

634
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:16,416
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I saw somebody I know.

635
00:47:16,623 --> 00:47:19,933
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?

636
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:21,337
He can't be tempted.

637
00:47:21,543 --> 00:47:23,135
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.

638
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:27,256
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.

639
00:47:29,703 --> 00:47:32,263
Hey. Hey, babe.

640
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:34,658
<i>How's the male bonding?</i>

641
00:47:34,863 --> 00:47:37,058
As you can guess, everybody's wasted.

642
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:41,299
In about half an hour, I'll be able...

643
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:43,775
<i>Derek, are you there?</i>

644
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:46,736
<i>Wait, I think Kyle wants
to say good night.</i>

645
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,899
<i>Derek, are you still there?</i>

646
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:51,936
- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- It'll just take a second.

647
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:54,896
- Say good night to Daddy.
- They're calling for me to come back.

648
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:58,015
- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
- Derek?

649
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:00,012
Derek?

650
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:01,372
Was that Sharon?

651
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,938
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...

652
00:48:04,143 --> 00:48:06,020
when you've been talking to her.

653
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,901
How did you know I'd be here?

654
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,458
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.

655
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:13,858
I'm not happy to see you.

656
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:15,098
What are you doing here?

657
00:48:15,303 --> 00:48:17,817
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.

658
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,093
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.

659
00:48:22,303 --> 00:48:23,816
You misunderstood me.

660
00:48:24,023 --> 00:48:29,143
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...

661
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:31,493
together, ever.

662
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:34,775
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.

663
00:48:34,983 --> 00:48:36,416
I'll tell you what they'll think.

664
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:39,296
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.

665
00:48:40,663 --> 00:48:42,255
What are you talking about?

666
00:48:43,743 --> 00:48:45,381
I see what you're doing.

667
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,258
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.

668
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:54,059
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...

669
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:55,935
I'll be waiting in my room, 610.

670
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:57,371
I'm not coming to your room.

671
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:00,256
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.

672
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:03,462
- You need help.
- I know.

673
00:49:04,743 --> 00:49:06,017
Help me, Derek.

674
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,535
You stay away from me.

675
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:14,451
- Sharon?
- Sharon?

676
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:16,938
It's Ben.
Dude, you done for the night?

677
00:49:17,143 --> 00:49:19,577
No. I'm coming back.

678
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:24,902
Hey, come on, D, it's early.

679
00:49:25,103 --> 00:49:27,571
Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.

680
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:32,857
No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.

681
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:36,578
All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a. m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.

682
00:49:36,783 --> 00:49:38,899
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.

683
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:41,617
Yeah, 9 a. m.

684
00:49:41,823 --> 00:49:43,620
Lightweight.

685
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:24,218
Out.

686
00:50:25,743 --> 00:50:26,937
Baby.

687
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:31,142
No.

688
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:39,338
Does that feel good?

689
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:41,135
No.

690
00:50:51,103 --> 00:50:52,582
Hush, baby.

691
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:08,977
No, please, stop.

692
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:18,740
Does that feel good?

693
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:35,775
Housekeeping.

694
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:37,780
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.

695
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:42,893
Oh, God.

696
00:51:50,623 --> 00:51:52,181
Oh, shit.

697
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,375
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...

698
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,813
have a couple advantages
over the competition...

699
00:51:59,023 --> 00:52:02,140
not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.

700
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:05,972
We don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.

701
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:08,743
Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.

702
00:52:08,943 --> 00:52:11,298
I'm sorry. I overslept.

703
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,856
You overslept.

704
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:15,531
The second great advantage
is that most of our clients...

705
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,938
are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...

706
00:52:18,143 --> 00:52:22,500
with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year...

707
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:24,341
You all know
how to read a bar chart.

708
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:27,535
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.

709
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:30,780
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...

710
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:33,543
the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...

711
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:35,938
is that they understand
that America is on sale.

712
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:38,179
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.

713
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:44,059
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?

714
00:52:44,263 --> 00:52:45,457
She's here.

715
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,652
Excuse me, Joe.

716
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:53,182
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say...

717
00:53:08,783 --> 00:53:10,774
Here's your wife, sir.

718
00:53:12,143 --> 00:53:14,896
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.

719
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:16,218
What are you doing?

720
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,135
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.

721
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:19,776
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?

722
00:53:19,983 --> 00:53:22,338
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation-

723
00:53:22,543 --> 00:53:24,181
Hey.

724
00:53:24,383 --> 00:53:26,180
What do you think this is?

725
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,214
The morning after.

726
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:30,575
We didn't do anything last night.

727
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:33,336
You don't remember?

728
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,421
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!

729
00:53:36,623 --> 00:53:39,296
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.

730
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:40,697
A scene?

731
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:43,133
Right. That's exactly what we need.

732
00:53:43,343 --> 00:53:45,573
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.

733
00:53:45,783 --> 00:53:48,741
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that-

734
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,979
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this. "

735
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:52,696
Don't say that.

736
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:54,416
Goddamn it, come here.

737
00:54:00,063 --> 00:54:01,462
What's wrong with you?

738
00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:04,455
Why are you acting like a stranger?

739
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:08,736
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.

740
00:54:09,423 --> 00:54:10,936
Now either you go in there...

741
00:54:11,143 --> 00:54:14,180
and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.

742
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:18,818
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.

743
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:22,015
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.

744
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:23,258
What?

745
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,135
The first time we met in the elevator.

746
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,418
Our dirty martini.

747
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:30,092
The Christmas party.

748
00:54:30,703 --> 00:54:34,013
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.

749
00:54:34,223 --> 00:54:35,451
No. No, I did not.

750
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,335
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!

751
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,228
Derek, you said it.

752
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:40,389
You said it.

753
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,677
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.

754
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,994
Is that what you want?

755
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,672
You want me to tell them the truth?

756
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,950
Ready when you are.

757
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,311
Hey, hey.

758
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,195
Listen to me!

759
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,319
What are you doing?

760
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,149
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.

761
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,148
You know what?

762
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,468
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...

763
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,468
because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.

764
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,908
Okay, Lisa?

765
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,712
Derek.

766
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,399
Derek?

767
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,433
Derek?

768
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,633
I realise we went a little long.

769
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,877
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...

770
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,832
and I apologise for the length of it.

771
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,635
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make...

772
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,558
Everything okay?

773
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,276
- Top you off.
- Thank you.

774
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,078
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.

775
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,474
You're not drinking?

776
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,717
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.

777
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,559
That's a first.

778
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,351
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.

779
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,079
He's just growing up.

780
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,592
Man.

781
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,438
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.

782
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,071
Hey. Lisa.

783
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,350
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here.

784
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,028
Come on. I'll drag you out of here.
Let's-

785
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,158
No. No, no, no.

786
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,278
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.

787
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,040
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.

788
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,798
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!

789
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,479
Okay.

790
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,710
Breathe. Breathe.

791
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,069
Bitch, breathe.

792
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,560
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.

793
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,755
Hello?

794
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,552
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.

795
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,432
Hi, Sharon, hi.

796
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,232
I'm sorry to disturb you.

797
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,193
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.

798
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,197
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

799
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,516
I was hoping he might be with you?

800
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,268
Yeah, there- There was
a kind of incident.

801
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,959
Is he all right?

802
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,834
Ben?

803
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,077
I think he should tell you himself.

804
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,471
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?

805
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,758
Excuse me. Is she okay?

806
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,428
The doctors are still working on her.

807
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,752
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?

808
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,111
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.

809
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,992
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie is watching him.

810
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,269
- What happened?
- Sharon.

811
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,152
Mr. Charles. How you doing?

812
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,954
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.

813
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,435
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.

814
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,074
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?

815
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,316
- What?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?

816
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,798
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.

817
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,197
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.

818
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,630
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?

819
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,319
Let's sit down.

820
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,910
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.

821
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,071
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?

822
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,157
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?

823
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,713
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.

824
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,672
Why? What? Well, what did she do?

825
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,757
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.

826
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,554
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.

827
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,829
Apparently, so do I.

828
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,116
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan-

829
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,595
Yeah, she worked with us
2 weeks.

830
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,756
What, you've only known her
for 2 weeks?

831
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,995
Approximately 2 weeks.

832
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,397
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?

833
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,160
- What?
- No. No.

834
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,238
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...

835
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,558
and then in the parking garage.

836
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,557
And then she showed up
at the retreat...

837
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,878
at my hotel, and I rejected her.

838
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,992
And when- Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...

839
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,590
she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.

840
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,395
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?

841
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,989
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?

842
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,189
Please.

843
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,994
- Would you say this affair was-
- There was no affair.

844
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,633
There was no affair.

845
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,877
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?

846
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,798
That is exactly what I'm saying.

847
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,036
Why do you think she'd pick you?

848
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,028
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.

849
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,878
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?

850
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,799
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?

851
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,356
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le-
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.

852
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,916
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.

853
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,838
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?

854
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,553
I don't know how she got
in my room.

855
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,389
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.

856
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,511
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.

857
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,632
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...

858
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,273
have sex with her.

859
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,592
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.

860
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,995
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.

861
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,471
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.

862
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,755
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.

863
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,758
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.

864
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,791
- Okay.
- Okay.

865
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,509
Detective?

866
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,836
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.

867
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,149
Sharon.

868
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,874
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.

869
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,308
A misunderstanding.

870
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,229
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?

871
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,873
You think I'm gonna believe that?

872
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,991
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!

873
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,760
- You didn't even call your son back-
- Sharon, listen.

874
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,030
Seems they pumped her out in time.

875
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,515
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the ICU...

876
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,110
and take her up to the 5th floor
for psychiatric evaluation.

877
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,595
That's great news. Okay, thank you.

878
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,588
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.

879
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,991
You still wanna stick to your story?

880
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,268
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?

881
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,074
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.

882
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,474
Sharon, is everything okay?

883
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,750
Julie. Hey, thank you.

884
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,439
Sharon.

885
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,359
Sharon.

886
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,758
Hey.

887
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,313
Sharon.

888
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,714
Can we talk?

889
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,718
Sharon, I just- Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do-

890
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,753
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?

891
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,996
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.

892
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,033
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.

893
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,913
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.

894
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,634
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.

895
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,795
Sharon, I was wrong.

896
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,355
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...

897
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,073
would you have even told me?

898
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,157
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have.

899
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,430
Like you told me about
the Christmas party, huh?

900
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,153
Or what about the parking garage?

901
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,670
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.

902
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,472
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?

903
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,671
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.

904
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,269
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the-

905
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,072
You should have! Why didn't you?

906
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,999
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...

907
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,474
...and then I was embarrassed.

908
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,468
- How do I say it without looking-?
- Guilty? Guilty?

909
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,719
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.

910
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,954
You think I encouraged this?

911
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,233
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.

912
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,000
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...

913
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,078
but you never did that to me.
Until now.

914
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,149
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?

915
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,873
God, Sharon, it is not like that.

916
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,469
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between-

917
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,319
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.

918
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,033
All I asked you was to be honest.

919
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,434
- I told you the truth!
- No.

920
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,959
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

921
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,312
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.

922
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,590
We made a vow
on our wedding day...

923
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,234
that we would tell each other
everything.

924
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,911
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.

925
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,272
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"

926
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,879
And what did you tell me?

927
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,752
- You said no.
- I know.

928
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,951
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.

929
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,115
Hey, hey, hey.

930
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,788
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.

931
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,991
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

932
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,191
Come on. Sharon. Please?

933
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,150
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!

934
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,193
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?

935
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,958
Get out of my house.

936
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,077
Nothing happened with this...

937
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,078
Okay. You know what?

938
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,750
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!

939
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,315
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.

940
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,557
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...

941
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,069
your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get out!

942
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,316
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.

943
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,157
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.

944
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,593
Sharon!

945
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,228
Miss Sheridan?

946
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,312
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.

947
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,432
- Come in.
- Thanks.

948
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,389
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

949
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,910
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.

950
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,759
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.

951
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,151
So you feel like talking
about the other night?

952
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,708
Have you spoken to Derek?

953
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,148
Yeah.

954
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,159
And he's all right?

955
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,556
Relatively speaking.

956
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,318
When can I see him?

957
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,114
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

958
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,993
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...

959
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,033
but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...

960
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,357
or continue any kind of contact.

961
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,071
Then why did he send me these?

962
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,078
He sent you flowers?

963
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,592
Lilies. My favourite.

964
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,755
Beautiful.

965
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,959
Yeah.

966
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,236
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?

967
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,396
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?

968
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,036
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.

969
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,070
Well, there's not much to tell.

970
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,998
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.

971
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,679
And you agreed?

972
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,678
Of course.

973
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,233
And then what happened?

974
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,554
I think you can guess what we did.

975
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,196
Yeah. You... You slept together.

976
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,628
Yes.

977
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,313
Well, Derek denies it, so...

978
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,350
He's just trying to protect me.

979
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,429
He's being a gentleman.

980
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,235
Right.

981
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,798
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.

982
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,116
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?

983
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,958
Yeah.

984
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,355
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.

985
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,918
I overreacted.

986
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,672
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.

987
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,273
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?

988
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,677
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.

989
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,871
What the break-up would do to him.

990
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,308
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?

991
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,393
Yeah.

992
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,670
How would you, you know...

993
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,350
characterise your relationship
with Derek?

994
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,076
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.

995
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,398
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?

996
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,477
I'm not a home wrecker.

997
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,068
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.

998
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,392
I do feel bad about his wife, though.

999
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,193
Well, how so?

1000
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,833
Well, it can't be easy...

1001
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,510
to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.

1002
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,438
Right.

1003
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,795
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.

1004
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,755
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have.

1005
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,952
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!

1006
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,913
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.

1007
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,554
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.

1008
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,557
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.

1009
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,832
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.

1010
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,156
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.

1011
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,237
Goddamn it, Joe!

1012
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,149
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.

1013
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,351
If we find out
there was something going on...

1014
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,551
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing.

1015
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,638
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

1016
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,835
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client-

1017
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:05,995
- Look-
- No, Joe.

1018
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,713
I'm not losing my client over this.

1019
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,595
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.

1020
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,074
Oh, Jesus.

1021
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,679
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1022
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,394
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.

1023
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,229
Come on.
You think I sent her flowers?

1024
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,513
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.

1025
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,913
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.

1026
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,352
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...

1027
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,278
- that she was keeping.
- Okay.

1028
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,789
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...

1029
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,515
of your various sexual liaisons
together.

1030
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,393
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's...

1031
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,239
"We... "

1032
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,878
This is bullshit.

1033
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,914
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.

1034
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,633
I've never touched her.

1035
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,594
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.

1036
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,236
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.

1037
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,032
Promises to divorce your wife and-

1038
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,470
Okay, detective.

1039
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,352
You seem smart.

1040
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,593
You can't possibly believe that.

1041
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,190
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.

1042
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,790
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?

1043
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,309
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.

1044
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,589
Let's do that.

1045
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,677
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?

1046
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,189
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...

1047
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,153
and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.

1048
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,391
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.

1049
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,074
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.

1050
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,119
You ready? Let's go for it.

1051
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,629
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.

1052
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,956
It's my birthday next week.

1053
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,799
Happy birthday.

1054
01:14:05,336 --> 01:14:07,888
Sharon, are you gonna make me
spend my birthday alone?

1055
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:15,586
Have dinner with me?

1056
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,822
Come on, Sharon.

1057
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,141
Move your foot, Derek.

1058
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,464
What do you think?

1059
01:14:55,710 --> 01:14:56,938
Be honest.

1060
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,545
Derek, your menu. Your menu.

1061
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,218
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1062
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:14,301
Sharon, this means a lot to me.

1063
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,145
I missed you.

1064
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:20,899
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.

1065
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,266
It's your party, birthday boy.

1066
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,739
You look beautiful.

1067
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,703
I love you.

1068
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,261
Sharon, I just wanna be home.

1069
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,342
Okay, it's been 3 months.

1070
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:43,578
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...

1071
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,748
your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...

1072
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,339
you name it, I'll do it.

1073
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,343
I got you something.

1074
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,668
- Should I just-?
- No.

1075
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:07,458
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.

1076
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:11,143
And welcome to "Fact or Fiction. "

1077
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:13,818
I'm your host, Rod Baker.

1078
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:18,661
And on today's show, let's welcome
back our champion, Bunny!

1079
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:36,300
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.

1080
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:38,139
You're...?

1081
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,622
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.

1082
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,503
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.

1083
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,063
I'm just gonna run it up to him.

1084
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,669
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.

1085
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:48,825
I won't wake him.

1086
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,782
Maybe you should come back
another time.

1087
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,582
But I'm here now.

1088
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:54,269
I...

1089
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:58,067
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.

1090
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,261
Do you need me to call Sharon?

1091
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,865
Yeah.

1092
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,822
Okay.

1093
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:13,778
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.

1094
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,986
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.

1095
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,579
She forgot.

1096
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,986
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.

1097
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:24,623
She was a little bit concerned.

1098
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:28,789
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.

1099
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:31,982
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.

1100
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:36,067
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.

1101
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:37,623
Oh, Sharon, hold on.

1102
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,229
Do you need to talk to her?

1103
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:40,943
No, no, I'm fine.

1104
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,787
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.

1105
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,183
I'll be back in a sec.

1106
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,019
Yeah.

1107
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:10,744
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...

1108
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:13,020
and I know that you miss me too.

1109
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:19,026
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.

1110
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:27,502
We're not talking about divorce,
right?

1111
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,224
I don't come from a family of divorce.

1112
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:33,581
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in 3 months.

1113
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:36,625
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.

1114
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,981
It is us. It can be us, will be us.

1115
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:55,062
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.

1116
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:59,707
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...

1117
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,502
and I wasn't.

1118
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:04,945
And that will never happen again.

1119
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:07,028
But I love you.

1120
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:11,189
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.

1121
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:18,988
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.

1122
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:22,705
Does Sharon... miss Daddy?

1123
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:26,869
I will do anything, anything.

1124
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,900
- Anything?
- You name it.

1125
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,948
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.

1126
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:41,148
What about the Benz?

1127
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,546
- The Benz.
- My Benz?

1128
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,981
I just- Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.

1129
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,748
You know, it's...

1130
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,139
Missed you.

1131
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:12,538
See you later!

1132
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,024
You too!

1133
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:30,023
Okay, it works, it works.

1134
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:32,505
Welcome home, baby.

1135
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:34,659
You driving my car.

1136
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:37,543
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.

1137
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,785
Any trouble with Kyle?

1138
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,584
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.

1139
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,860
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?

1140
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:45,025
I don't know a Kate.

1141
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:46,982
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.

1142
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,623
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?

1143
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:50,627
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?

1144
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,343
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?

1145
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:56,145
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!

1146
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:57,544
Kyle?

1147
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:00,145
She took my baby.

1148
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,386
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1149
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:04,945
What happened? Tell me.

1150
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,505
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.

1151
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,746
She left? Kyle's not in his room!

1152
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:11,781
Call 911! Now!

1153
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,342
Kyle?

1154
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,101
Kyle?

1155
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:27,746
Kyle? Son?

1156
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,902
Kyle!

1157
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:40,899
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

1158
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,348
Kyle, oh.

1159
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:52,186
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.

1160
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:06,145
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's fine.

1161
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:08,580
I don't see any reason
why you can't take him home.

1162
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,701
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

1163
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,463
Hey.

1164
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:17,503
How's he doing?

1165
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:19,109
Doctor says he's fine.

1166
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:23,019
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.

1167
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,141
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.

1168
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,659
You said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?

1169
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,588
And how did she even know
we'd be out?

1170
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:31,382
Obviously she was watching
your house.

1171
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,943
We need you to find her.

1172
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,220
I will do everything in my power
to find her.

1173
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,739
One of you better do something
about this woman.

1174
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,149
Or I will.

1175
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:45,348
So, what am I supposed to do now?

1176
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:46,983
- Buy a gun?
- Please.

1177
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,748
We'll have our unit tracking her.

1178
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:51,418
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.

1179
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:54,224
She could have hurt my son.
My son.

1180
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:17,418
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?

1181
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,507
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.

1182
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:22,863
Oh, no.

1183
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,459
Oh, no. God.

1184
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:29,023
Jesus.

1185
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,468
This psycho.

1186
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:32,864
She never left.

1187
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:48,140
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.

1188
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:50,147
My name, Derek Charles.

1189
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:52,028
Yeah, she knows me.

1190
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,186
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.

1191
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:58,827
Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you missed me.
Leave me a message after the beep.

1192
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:03,585
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.

1193
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:07,984
You came into my house,
you touched my child...

1194
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,946
and you think you're crazy?

1195
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,469
I'll show you crazy.

1196
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,064
Just try me, bitch!

1197
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,829
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?

1198
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,668
Definitely.

1199
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:27,979
Simple.

1200
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:31,341
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.

1201
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:34,940
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.

1202
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,823
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.

1203
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:39,907
There's also one in your master.

1204
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,147
Okay, so you packed everything?

1205
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,419
What time you taking off?

1206
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:03,509
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.

1207
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,268
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.

1208
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:07,301
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.

1209
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,341
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.

1210
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,142
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1211
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:14,148
Bye.

1212
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,144
Derek Charles's office.

1213
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,465
Patrick.

1214
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:27,662
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.

1215
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,508
What, like 6 months?

1216
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:32,508
I know. We've got a lot of gossip
to catch up on.

1217
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:36,498
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.

1218
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,826
Trust me, you're not getting fired.

1219
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,065
What do you mean?

1220
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:41,908
Derek didn't tell you.

1221
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,304
Tell me what?

1222
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,546
He's leaving Sharon.
They're getting a divorce.

1223
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:49,423
- A divorce?
- Like that's a surprise.

1224
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:52,349
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.

1225
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,745
Patrick, come on.
I know what I'm talking about.

1226
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:58,829
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents' anniversary?

1227
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,509
Derek's not going.

1228
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,826
Yeah, actually, he is.

1229
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:06,147
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.

1230
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:09,986
Lisa? Did you hear me?

1231
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,179
Patrick, I have to go.

1232
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:12,618
No, you just called.

1233
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:47,665
My purse.

1234
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,265
Joe needs these by 5.

1235
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:57,984
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.

1236
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,504
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.

1237
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:06,224
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala-

1238
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:08,068
Oh, God, I forgot.

1239
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:10,545
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.

1240
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,379
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.

1241
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,421
Hey. Call me back.

1242
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,662
Did you not get my message?

1243
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,499
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.

1244
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:23,588
I knew it would come to this.

1245
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:28,944
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.

1246
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,629
I know.

1247
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,266
You are completely delusional.

1248
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:38,869
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.

1249
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:41,584
- Wait, it doesn't-
- Don't touch me.

1250
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:45,746
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!

1251
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:55,987
Crazy!

1252
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,625
Get off of me!

1253
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,181
You have reached
the Charles Residence.

1254
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:26,183
Sharon.

1255
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:27,743
Are you there?

1256
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,303
- Derek.
- Lisa?

1257
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:36,024
What are you doing in my house?

1258
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:37,663
Sharon.

1259
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:40,148
Sharon?

1260
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,500
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.

1261
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:53,585
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.

1262
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,746
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

1263
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:58,059
Come here, bitch.

1264
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:02,064
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.

1265
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:05,467
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?

1266
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:14,548
Come here!

1267
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,628
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?

1268
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:19,343
Nobody touches my child.

1269
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,500
Come on. Come here!

1270
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:09,908
Come on, this what you want?

1271
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:11,987
Come on.

1272
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:26,629
Come a little closer.

1273
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:29,784
You almost got it, come on.

1274
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:32,102
Come on.

1275
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:42,099
You want some of me?
You almost got me.

1276
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:48,138
Come on, bitch.

1277
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:19,668
Take my hand.

1278
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:21,508
Come on, take my hand.

1279
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:24,665
I got you.

1280
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:32,662
Come on, come on.

1281
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:37,909
Crazy bitch.

1282
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:55,908
Get off of me.

1283
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:30,869
Oh, God.

1284
01:38:58,190 --> 01:38:59,987
Oh, God.

1285
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:48,348
Sharon? You all right?

1286
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:51,259
What happened here?

1287
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:53,506
I think you know what happened.

1288
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:57,222
Stay here.

1289
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:00,944
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?

1290
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:05,069
- It's over.
- It's over.
