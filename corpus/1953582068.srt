It all happened because Dylan
slipped a little clause in our

it all happened because Dylan
slipped a little clause in our
prenup...

2625
01:44:45,747 --> 01:44:47,113
Slipped a little clause in our
prenup...
A clause I never bothered to

2626

A clause I never bothered to
read.

2627
01:44:47,682 --> 01:44:49,081
A clause I never bothered to
read.
Otherwise, I never would have

I followed through on this.
It was a journey of meeting

2637

It was a journey of meeting
people, talking with them,

people, talking with them,
reasoning with some, arguing

01:45:14,742 --> 01:45:17,276

reasoning with some, arguing
with others, listening to their

with others, listening to their
pains, their turmoils, their

2641
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:22,415

pains, their turmoils, their
successes, their failures, their

2642
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:27,720

successes, their failures, their
mistakes and their regrets --

2643
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:33,092

mistakes and their regrets --
their life lessons.

2644
01:45:33,094 --> 01:45:34,727
Mistakes and their regrets --
their life lessons.
Now, I was mad at Dylan for

2645

Now, I was mad at Dylan for
making me come here today.

making me come here today.

2647
01:45:39,767 --> 01:45:42,034

I thought she was a selfish,
stubborn woman...

2648
01:45:42,036 --> 01:45:43,903

stubborn woman...
Until I ran into a single mom

2649
01:45:43,905 --> 01:45:45,738

Until I ran into a single mom
with five kids who asked me a

2650
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:46,772
until I ran into a single mom
with five kids who asked me a
question.

2651
01:45:46,774 --> 01:45:49,342
With five kids who asked me a
question.
She said, "what if Dylan had

2652
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:51,777
question.
She said, "what if Dylan had
instigated the divorce?

2653
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:53,746
She said, "what if Dylan had
instigated the divorce?
Would she have to go through the

2654
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:54,413

Would she have to go through the
same hell?"

2655
01:45:54,415 --> 01:45:56,482
Would she have to go through the
same hell?"
So, I read the prenup again,

2656
01:45:56,484 --> 01:45:58,984
same hell?"
So, I read the prenup again,
and, sure as shit, she'd have to

01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,256
And, sure as shit, she'd have to
go through the same hell I did.
That's when I realized that this

2659

That's when I realized that this
clause wasn't evil after all.

2660
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:12,765
That's when I realized that this
clause wasn't evil after all.
It was fair -- to both of us.

2661
01:46:12,767 --> 01:46:13,999
Clause wasn't evil after all.
It was fair -- to both of us.
And it was fair to our unborn

2662
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:15,234
it was fair -- to both of us.
And it was fair to our unborn
child that the parents aren't

and it was fair to our unborn
child that the parents aren't
gonna just walk away from each

gonna just walk away from each

Gonna just walk away from each

I realized that this -- this

I realized that this -- this
long journey that I had to take

2667
01:46:21,309 --> 01:46:23,209
I realized that this -- this
long journey that I had to take
was the perfect counseling for a

long journey that I had to take
was the perfect counseling for a
torn, confused man like me.

2669

torn, confused man like me.
When I put on this suit today, I

2670

was reminded how I felt on my

when I put on this suit today, I
was reminded how I felt on my
wedding day.

the word "love" lately.

Love is a...
Powerful emotion.

Indescribable feeling you get
when you see someone who you

2677

indescribable feeling you get
when you see someone who you
know will do anything for you...

2678
01:46:57,378 --> 01:47:00,413
When you see someone who you
know will do anything for you...
When you see someone with a life

2679
01:47:00,415 --> 01:47:03,349
know will do anything for you...
When you see someone with a life
growing inside of them, a life

2680
01:47:03,351 --> 01:47:05,284
when you see someone with a life
growing inside of them, a life
you helped create.

2681
01:47:05,286 --> 01:47:17,396
Love is sticking it out.
Living with someone day after
day, waking up next to them
