Heather is probably gonna stop by.

358
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,290
The signal is great. I need you--

359
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,667
You are from where?

360
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,460
I'm from Los Angeles. I need--

How long?

368
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,395
Like 36 hours.

369
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,524
And I need someone to get to the hotel
and get the footage before it's erased

370
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,985
so we can see
when she and her boyfriend left.

but they can't even investigate directly.

Oh, June. Interesting thing.

384
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,905
Did you know that your phones
are always tracking you?

385
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,824
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

386
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,827
But I can't get into her accounts
even if I wanted to.

387
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,120
And did you try his?

388
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,372
What?

389
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,875
You said she's traveling
with her boyfriend.

390
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,211
So if you can't find hers, maybe...

391
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,337
Right.

392
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,924
[pensive music playing]

393
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,219

-Yo.
-[June] Hey, Vee.

395
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,356
Thanks for coming by.
Heather never showed up.

396

Of course. This is so crazy.

Uh, hey, I think Caesar's
eating your smartwatch.

398
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,739
What? I don't have a smartwatch.

399
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:39,868
Anyway, does Kevin give you
same-password-for-everything type of vibe?

400
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,703
Mm... 50-50.

401
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,000
Actually, 60-40.
Why is your mom dating this guy?

402
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,627
Heather thinks he's hot.

403
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,128
[Veena] Of course she does.

404
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,047
So you're trying to get his password?

405
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,131
[June] Yeah.

406
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,093
Oh, yeah. This will work.

407
00:27:56,176 --> 00:28:00,138
Do you remember that time you impersonated
the Postmates driver on the phone?

408
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,307
[in deep voice] Dude, he had no idea.

409
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,142

Okay. Let's see where they were going.

428
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,257
There's their Uber to LAX.

00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:23,430
Wait.

432
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,017
[Veena in normal voice]
Maybe he didn't have service?

433
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,769
[June]
But he was texting me the whole time.

434

-Unless he turned off his location.

435

how do you say, the cleaning <i>señora</i>,

438
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,787
she went to school with my son.
And we got to talking--

439
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,539
No, Javi, no time for stories.

440
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:49,748
Hold on.

441
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,292
So I explain to her what I'm looking for,

442
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:56,088
and she says she sees
two American tourists leave on Friday.

443
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,257
Wait, so she saw them leave.

444
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,092
Now you have time for the story, huh?

445
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:02,845
So they're going to leave,
and your mother says sorry

446
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:06,014
because she spilled some wine
on the bedsheets.

00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,558
This is like 1 in the afternoon.

448
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,937
She dressed up very nice, so the<i> señora
</i>asked if they were going somewhere fancy.

449
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,273
And guess what your stepfather said.

456
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,789
Did she say what store they went to?

457
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,708
Uh, no, she didn't ask.

458
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,419
There's gotta be a way to figure it out.

No. Getsemani. That's not a store.

Okay, well, I'm sending you
all the hardware stores in Getsemani.

471
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,381
Talk to the workers,
see if they saw anything, okay?

472
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,675
[Javi] Or maybe I just buy some gum.

473
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,137
-Huh?
-To see if the bank code matches. Eh?

474
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:32,351
Oh, my God. Yes, Javi. Yes.
Okay, I'm sending you the code now.

475
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:36,522
June, eight stores might take a few hours.
Is that okay with you?

476
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,357
[June] For now.

477
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,902
I'll look through his emails too,
see if there's a receipt in there.

478
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,111
Okay.

479
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,572

Yeah, so?

482

So you can't break into Kevin's email
without permission.

483
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,042
But why would he turn off his locations?
That doesn't make sense.

484
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,838
I don't know, but you need
to let the police handle this stuff.

Um, are you coming over?

00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,805

00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:47,516
Lots of tourists. And good for couples.

693
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,647
Hold on a sec.

694
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,733
[tense pensive music playing]

695
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,031
There.

696
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,205
Javi, can you wave for me?

697
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,373
<i>¿Qué?</i>

698
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,499
Wave.

699
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,379
I see you. [laughs]

700
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,256
Hey, June! [laughs]

701
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,717
Okay, let me check the archive.

702
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:34,438
Come on, come on, come on.

703
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,690
Wait.

704
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:38,442
There!

705
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,195
[Javi] Do you see them?

706
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:44,740
Yeah.

707
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,079
He has the lock.

708
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,337
Wait.

709
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,465
Wait, he's pulling something
out of his pocket.

710
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:05,010
[tense pensive music continues]

711
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,851
What?

712
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,782
It was real.

713
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:31,161
[call ringing]

714
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,704
Is everything all right?

715
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,749
Um, yeah. Let me call you back.

716
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,044
[Park] <i>Ms. Allen? We may have found them.</i>

717
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,255
[June] I know they were at the bridge.
You were right.

718
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:42,548
He wasn't trying to con her.

719
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:44,550
<i>-Ms. Allen.
</i>-Yeah?

720
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,760
<i>Listen.</i>

721
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:48,846
<i>We've got some bad news.</i>

722
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,932
[ominous music playing]

723
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:58,021
[men speaking in Spanish]

724
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:01,859
[June] Oh, my God.

725

[Kevin & Grace yelling]

726
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,573
[June] Who are these people?

727
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,866
[Park] <i>We don't know.</i>

728
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:12,035
<i>We just received this this morning
from an anonymous source.</i>

729
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,997
<i>We're mobilizing units
across the city as we speak.</i>

730
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,291
What are they gonna do to her?

731
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,293
<i>Well, we flagged a withdrawal</i>

732
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,795
<i>from your mom's bank
to an encrypted third-party account,</i>

733
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:23,630
<i>so they may just want money.</i>

734
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:26,300
[June] So, what now?
Is there anything I can do?

735
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:29,261
<i>Hey, we're gonna find these guys, okay?</i>

736
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:32,598
<i>The best thing you can do to help us
is just wait by your phone.</i>

737
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:33,974
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

738
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:35,726
[tires screech]

739
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,770
They said something about money,
but what if these people hurt her?

740
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:39,938
They have no reason to.

741
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:43,567
I've already lost one parent, Javi.
I can't lose her too.

742
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,652
[music fades]

743
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,363
I didn't even say goodbye.

744
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:58,498
When did you lose your father?

745
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,836
I'm sorry
if you don't wanna talk about it.

746
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,838
No, it's fine. Um...

747
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,633
It was years ago.

748
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,345
I can't even remember the funeral.

749
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:17,893
My son Carlos lost his mom
when he was very young too.

750
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,520
That's why I ask.

751
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:21,897
I know it's hard.

752
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,148
Yeah.

753
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,734
Your son is lucky he still has you, Javi.

754
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,194
[Javi] Hm.

755
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:29,655
I don't know.

756
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,699
What do you mean?

757
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,786
He was always trouble.

758
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,706
But the trouble got worse,
then one day we had this big fight and...

759
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,754
He said he never wanted
to talk to me again.

760
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,173
I guess he meant it.

761
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:53,929
But, you know,
even if he doesn't want to see me,

762
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,556
he's always <i>mi Carlito</i>.

763
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:00,727
And whatever you are
beating yourself over with your mom...

764
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,523
it doesn't change a parent's love.

765
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:05,691
I know.

766
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,153
Have you tried reaching out?

767
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:12,739
To your son?

768
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:16,535
[poignant music playing]

769
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,121
He knows where I am.

770
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,086
Well, anyway, um...

771
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,175
I don't wanna take
any more of your time, Javi.

772
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:33,760
-Thank you.
-It's no problem, June.

773
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,679
Call anytime.

774
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:38,056
And, listen, they're gonna find her.

775
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:39,892
I know.

776
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,978
Peace, <i>amiga</i>. Hm?

777
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,023
[softly] Peace.

778
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:55,741

785

Good morning.

786
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,384
I'm Elijah Park with the FBI.

787
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:24,723
Last evening we determined
that U.S. citizen Grace Allen,

788
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:28,519
previously thought to have been kidnapped
here in Cartagena, Colombia,

789
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:33,982
was in fact impersonated in an
alleged scheme by the suspects behind me.

790
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:38,070
We are now turning to the public
for any information

791
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:42,991
regarding the whereabouts of Miss Allen,
who we now believe...

792
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,536
never left Los Angeles.

793
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,621
-[reporters clamoring]
-[cameras clicking]

794
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,626
Hi, everybody, first up this morning:
"The strangest case I've ever seen."

795
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,296
Those are the words used
by LAPD Detective Luciana Gomez

796
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,049
to describe the disappearance
of a Van Nuys resident

797
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,260
<i>who was seemingly swapped out</i>

798
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:04,012
<i>with another woman
along their Uber drive to LAX.</i>

799
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:08,058
[Gomez] <i>Because of the staged kidnapping,
we've lost a lot of time.</i>

800
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:13,105
It's now been over a week since Miss Allen
was last seen, so we need to move quickly.

801
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:18,193
[woman] <i>A ground search begins today
for a woman police say went missing</i>

802
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:22,281
<i>somewhere along
her nearly 22-mile trip to the airport.</i>

803
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,116
-[man] Grace!
-[people yelling]

804
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,451
[tense music playing]

805
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:29,872
Grace!

806
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,583
[doorbell chimes]

807
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,420
They were talking to you for a while.
They know anything?

808
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:39,756
They think whatever happened
must have been on the drive to LAX.

809
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,259
Right, right, right.
Look at this. Look at 'em.

810
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:47,764
<i>So your mom gets in the Uber,
they take the 405,</i>

811
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,475
<i>and then a totally different woman
gets out at LAX.</i>

812
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:54,771
If Kevin did something to her,
that's when it happened.

813
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:58,942
The weird thing is, he only ever stopped
for three minutes along the way.

814
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:01,987
He must have had help.

815
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:06,658
[Gomez] Uber has no record of the trip,
and the car was using stolen plates.

816
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,119
-We got an APB out for the vehicle now.
-[reporters clamoring]

817
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,495
Yep. Down in front.

818
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:13,165
[man] Is it possible
that the Uber driver was hired?

819
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:14,333
It's possible.

820
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,585
According to our friends at the FBI...

821
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:19,963
Large withdrawals from Miss Allen's bank
account were made after her disappearance.

822
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,842
In the meantime, the one person
who knows for sure what's going on here...

823
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,427
Is Mr. Lin.

824
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,888
So we're working with the police
around the region,

825
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,265
including officers
at the Venezuelan border.

826
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:32,017
We find him...

827
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,478
-And we find Grace Allen.
-[reporters clamoring]

[woman speaking in Spanish]

829
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:38,857
[June] Whoa. Javi, what are they saying?

830
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:42,736
They say that the police
arrested some local students

831
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:46,406
that Lin hired to be part of a movie.

832
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,492
[speaking in Spanish]

833
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,999
-Whoa. June, check this out.
-Huh?

834
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:00,462
[woman 1]
They're arresting her. Right now.

835
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:02,506
There she is. There, there.

836
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,508
[woman 2] No, no, no. Can you see her?

837
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:05,717
What?

838
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,469
[passengers chattering]

839
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:12,182
Aspiring actress Rachel Page, recently
detained upon reentering the U.S.,

840
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,769
was released today on bail
as a cooperating witness.

841
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,772
[Rachel] <i>He said it was a reality show.</i>

842
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,693
Like a lifestyle travel thing,

843
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,237
all shot on a iPhone and stuff.

844
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,615
I had to walk a certain way,
dress a certain way.

845
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,410
And I couldn't even
post anything on Instagram.

846
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:33,662
[tense music continues]

847
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,999
But after the kidnapping scene,

848
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,793
I knew something was up.

849
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:41,545
So I made a run for it.

850
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:45,048
But there was no crew, no real cameras.

851
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:47,176
None of that seemed odd?

852
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:48,343
I just thought:

853
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:52,097
"Damn. This guy has a vision."

854
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,475
-[chimes]
-[June] How do you know she's not lying?

855
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,687
Miss Page said Kevin and his driver
picked her up near the 405,

856
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,814
so LAPD checked traffic cameras.

857
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,151
By the time Kevin got there,
your mom was already gone.

858
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:05,694
Miss Page never saw her.

859
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,572
[June] Okay, well, did she get
a good look at the driver?

860
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:11,074
[Park] Middle-aged, baseball hat,
that's all we got.

861
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,494
She couldn't see his face
from the back seat.

862
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,538
Yo, Kevin for sure hired that guy.

863
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,207

864
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,583

Listen, Miss Allen, while I have you,

866
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,713
I have some questions
regarding something we're looking into.

867
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:26,089
Okay.

868
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,800
You mentioned that you don't have
any extended family, right?

869
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:29,718
No.

870
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,762
[Park] To the best of your knowledge,

871
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,972
your mom has never
gone by any other names?

872
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:37,476
No. She's just Grace Allen. Why?

873
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:39,937
[sighs]

874
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:44,900
Exclusive developments tonight
in the case of Grace Allen:

875
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:49,279
Public records suggesting there may
be more to the missing Van Nuys resident

876
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,572
than meets the eye.

877
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:55,702
Turns out Grace Allen is just
one of the mystery woman's aliases,

878
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:59,957
<i>whose real identity lies locked
behind a court-ordered seal.</i>

879
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,917
You're her lawyer.
There's nothing you can do?

880
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,336
It's a court-ordered seal.

881
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:07,548
It's gonna take at least a week
to get a judge to lift it.

882
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:10,717
And she never said
anything to you about this?

883
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:12,010
I don't...

884
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:14,680
No, I don't think so.

885
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,892
Why would she keep this from me?

886
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:23,105
[woman] Does this suggest Grace Allen
herself might be implicated?

887
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,523
Let me be clear:

888
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:27,442
Right now, Grace Allen is not a suspect.

889
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:29,403
That being said,

890
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:30,904
we can't rule anything out.

for helping her disappear.</i>

901

<i>Why else would she--</i>

902
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:59,516
She hired Lin and the driver,
stages the kidnapping,

903
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,144
hides in the trunk, drives off,
starts a new life somewhere.

904
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,271
Which we know she's done once before.

905
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,941
I mean, zero known family members,
other than the daughter?

906
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:09,651
That's hella sus.

[June] I cannot take this anymore!

909
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,449
It's just the Internet, June.

910
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:19,036
No, no, it's not just the Internet.
It's the police too.

Hey, hey, hey.
It's going to be okay, June.

How many tax dollars have been wasted

916
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,060
searching for someone
who clearly ran away?

917
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:47,606
I mean, her coworker described her
as dodgy and guarded about her past.

918
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:51,485
[June] How can people believe any of this?
They're focusing on the wrong person.

919
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:53,737
[Veena] At least they're trying to help.

920
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,240
Like, imagine if this
was an <i>Unfiction </i>episode.

921
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:59,076
You'd be asking questions too, no?

922
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:02,412
About Kevin. Not my mom.

923
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:05,249
Yeah, but even you said
she was hiding something, right?

924
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:08,836
She knew about Kevin the whole time.
Plus the whole identity change--

925
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,420
Veena, what the hell?

926
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:14,383
No, I just mean that
there are some legit questions.

927
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,593
There are no questions!

928
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:19,638
This is not a show, this is my mom!

929
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,473
June, obviously I--

930
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:22,891
You should just go.

939
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:18,210
She was messaging Kevin
less than 24 hours ago.

940
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,295
Plus she's been ignoring me
since they went missing.

941
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:23,674
Breathe. Just breathe.
Maybe there is a good answer.

942
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:26,051
And she's been obsessed with Kevin
ever since they met.

943
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,761
It's all making sense.

944
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:29,888
-What is that?
-It has a camera.

945
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,557
This way, she won't know I'm recording.

946
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,644
June, if you think something is wrong,
you need to tell <i>la policía.</i>

947
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:40,107
I have tried! I have tried telling them
about Kevin and about Rachel.

948
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,026
But anything I find
on Kevin's account can't be used

949
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,196
to help "build a prosecutable case"
or whatever,

950
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,614
so I have to record her.

951
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,241
I'm syncing to the watch now.

952
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:53,412
I need you to stay on the phone while
I'm in there in case something happens.

955
01:05:56,164 --> 01:06:00,043
No, the police are acting like
my mom's some kind of criminal mastermind.

956
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:04,381

you need to trust them.

What are you saying?

958
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:09,553
Just because someone is your parent,

959
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,306
it doesn't mean they do not make mistakes.

960
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:13,390
Oh.

961
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,768
I guess you would know, huh?

962
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,772
Maybe you gave up on your son...

963

whoever did this
was there minutes before you arrived.

01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,800
You're lucky to be alive.

991
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:41,305
They must've seen
the messages I sent to her.

992
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,184
They knew I was coming.

993
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:52,149
I just don't understand
why she'd be messaging him.

994
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:55,529
Look, the wiped computer,
the missing files...

995
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:59,783
My guess is that she knew something
that Kevin didn't want us to know.

996
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,453
She wasn't willfully messaging him.

997
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:06,623
He was threatening her.

998
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,500
And the photos were...?

999
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,711
To keep her quiet. Yeah.

1000
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:18,177
She was trying to protect me.

1001
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:24,725
But if Kevin is still in Colombia,
who did this?

1002
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:26,101
I don't know.

1003
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:28,854
But in the meantime,
LAPD will stay there with you

1004
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:31,732
until they find a safe place
for you to go. Okay?

1005
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:35,819
Look, Mr. Lin is the key to all of this.

1006
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:39,823
Now, the good news is police
may have spotted him near the border,

1007

June, you don't know
what she's capable of.

1115

She lied to a judge
to have me put in prison

1116

so that she could have you to herself.

1117

-Mom?
-Yeah?

1383
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:29,608
This is FaceTime.

1384
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:31,109
Oh, gosh.

1385
01:42:31,193 --> 01:42:32,444
I know, I know.

1386
01:42:32,528 --> 01:42:34,571
-I just put the phone down for a second.
-Mm-hm.

1387
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:37,741
I just wanted to remind you that
your bus leaves at 8:35 in the morning,

1388
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,785
so you might wanna set multiple alarms.

1389
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:41,161
Yep. Already did.

1390
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:43,914
I'll also send you some lunch money
if you need any, okay?

1391
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:45,916
What?

1392
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,626
Nothing.

1393
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:50,295
Just thank you.

1394

1395
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:55,843
Oh, guess what.

1396
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:59,304
Your friend Javi friended me on Facebook.

1397
01:42:59,388 --> 01:43:00,931
For real? No way.

1398
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:11,275
Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you
at Union Station tomorrow afternoon.

1399
01:43:11,358 --> 01:43:12,526
Can't wait.

1400
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:14,152
Bye.

1401
01:43:15,237 --> 01:43:16,071
Oh, hey--

1402
01:43:35,382 --> 01:43:36,258
