1
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,470
Can you remove
my blindfold, please?

2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,190
Can you remove
my blindfold, please?

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,832
Not yet!

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,518
Where are you taking me?

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,870
- Where are you taking me?
- Shut up!

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,152
Closet Land

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,676
Tell me if you need anything else.
I'm leaving in 10 minutes.

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,956
Let me see...
I think I have everything.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,838
Where am I?

10
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,874
Here.

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,031
Who are you?

12
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,873
May I speak to the officer
in charge, please?

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,792
I am the officer in charge.

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,879
Where are you?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,513
Here. To your right.

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,397
And vice versa, your vices are
my verses, and versa vice.

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,918
Remove my blindfold and
these handcuffs, please.

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,548
I'm going to call my lawyer.
I was dragged out of bed...

19
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,188
All right. Don't worry.
We'll look into it.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,911
I won't be needing you anymore.

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,471
I'm going straight to the sauna,
there is nothing like it after this shit.

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,196
<i>Bon nuit.
(Good night)</i>

23
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,670
Where are you?
Have you gone away, too?

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,589
I'm here, right by your side.

25
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,869
Did I scare you? Sorry.

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,597
Just a minute.
I'll turn the lights on.

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,391
Let's get this blindfold off.

28
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,674
Why and when was I brought here?

29
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,758
Which day is it?

30
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,954
A next day. A night, actually.

31
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,791
I was brought here last night.

32
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,269
I think it was last night.
Sometimes, it seems like...

33
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,477
...two nights back,
two weeks even. - No.

34
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,678
They brought you here last night.

35
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,717
Are you the officer in charge?

36
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,815
They came to my house when I was
in bed. One man held a gun to my head

37
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,638
and handcuffed me. The other
blindfolded and gagged me.

38
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,911
They dragged me
out of my own home.

39
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,039
On the way here, they
slapped me, spat on me...

40
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,150
...pulled my hair,
twisted my arms,

41
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,392
pinched my legs, and left me
standing in a narrow cold room...

42
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,836
no bigger than a...
...a closet.

43
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,230
Given no warrant for my arrest.

44
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,231
I've been denied access to my
lawyer, to anyone else outside.

45
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,839
Why am I here?

46
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
It says here that you're
a writer of children's fiction.

47
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,192
Do you do any other
kind of writing?

48
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,348
Like what?

49
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,472
- Political, for instance.
- No.

50
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,354
- I'm really quite ignorant
about politics. - Good.

51
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,391
I mean, it's better to have no
ideas than half-baked ones.

52
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,149
Too, you're not a member of any
underground group or anything?

53
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,469
No.

54
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,872
- Are your stories political?
- I write for 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds!

55
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,919
So? Children make the best
receptacles for propaganda.

56
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,436
"You can do anything with a child
as long as you play with him."

57
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,194
- Who said that?
- Bismarck.

58
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,957
This is ridiculous.

59
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,112
Well...

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,195
...maybe we made a mistake.

61
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,155
Doesn't happen often,
but sometimes...

62
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,159
If they've had too much to drink,
maybe they took a wrong turn.

63
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,197
"They took the wrong turn"?

64
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,310
My sincere apologies.

65
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,558
You may leave.

66
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,597
Maybe you should wait
for the official apology.

67
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,114
What's that?

68
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,789
To letter from the head of this
department, apologizing for our mistake.

69
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,077
How long will that take?

70
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,429
No time at all.

71
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,351
You interrogated me
like a common criminal,

72
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,351
knowing full well you
owed me an apology?!

73
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,032
It's procedure.
We can never be too sure.

74
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,430
No, no, I insist.
I'm used to this place.

75
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,194
I last saw you about
two years ago, I think.

76
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,953
You were signing autographs at the Third
Street bookstore. I forget what it is...

77
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,918
Sorry, but I'm really not in
the mood for conversation.

78
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,429
You think your apology
letter's enough?!

79
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,435
I'm going to press charge,
against him especially.

80
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,311
You're going to press what,
against whom?

81
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,718
I said that I...

82
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,915
I'm going to make
a complaint against him.

83
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,597
The one that was here. Didn't get to
see him, but I know his voice.

84
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,111
- What did it sound like?
- A chocked gutter.

85
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,629
"Man with a voice...

86
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,200
...like a chocked gutter."

87
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,669
What did he do?

88
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,511
Did he rape you?

89
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,229
No.

90
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,229
He just fondled you? Is that it?

91
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,228
Yes.

92
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,072
That's strange.

93
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,189
None of our female prisoners
have made that complaint.

94
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,430
Our men don't do that.
They're strictly professional.

95
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,519
I'm not lying.

96
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,235
- I'm sure you're not, but
maybe you imagined it. - No!

97
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,969
After one day in prison,
you are ranting and

98
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,618
raving about having been here
two weeks. Is it why you are

99
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,216
such a good writer? Imagination.
- No, I have his nail-marks all over...

100
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,271
Can I see them?

101
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,597
Let a doctor examine me.

102
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,232
All right. Don't worry.

103
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,712
We'll look into it.

104
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,113
Some more broth?

105
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,193
It's got rum in it.

106
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,192
Warms you up, doesn't it?

107
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,030
Listen. How long
will the letter be?

108
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,158
- What letter?
- The apo...

109
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,995
- The apology letter.
- Oh, that.

110
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,315
- You had it all along?
- Yes.

111
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,157
- What game are you playing?
- I'm not playing games.

112
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,710
- But you kept me here, waiting for it!
- Now you're imagining things again!

113
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,189
You decided to wait.
Didn't I tell you I had the letter?

114
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,793
This is a mess.

115
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,520
Drunken soldiers,
hallucinating senior officers.

116
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,717
You really should watch
what you're saying, you know.

117
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,715
Walls have ears.

118
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,869
Open the door!

119
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,679
I have the apology letter!
Open up, please!

120
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,592
Might as well stay warm!

121
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,400
It could be a long time
before you.

122
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,835
I must call my lawyer.
I must call my lawyer.

123
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,073
What is that?

124
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,434
Why didn't you leave
when you could?

125
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,799
You cannot call your lawyer
or anyone else outside.

126
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,951
You must put your trust in us.

127
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,156
I am a small part of
a large mechanism,

128
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,392
that goes for you, too, but together
we may seek at the truth.

129
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,516
I will help you to
the best of my ability,

130
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,717
but the brunt of the
responsibility lies with you.

131
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,188
Deliberate deceit
will not be tolerated,

132
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,999
although personally,
I may find your lies charming.

133
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,958
Inadvertent blunders will
be treated with firm kindness,

134
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,398
and you must trust me to decide
the ratio of firmness to kindness.

135
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,558
Your best hope would be
to depersonalize what follows,

136
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,951
and not to look upon me as
a foe or yourself as a victim.

137
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,157
Remember, we are both
seekers of truth,

138
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,232
and in this quest, I am your friend,

139
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,997
philosopher and guide.

140
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,075
"The Cow who Learned to Fly"

141
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,516
"The Treasure Trove"

142
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,517
"The Cat With Green Wings"

143
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,830
Heavy-duty political stuff, huh?

144
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,072
No, you're right.
These stories are innocuous.

145
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,273
I told you you're
making a terrible mistake.

146
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,397
No, that's not possible.

147
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,831
Are you infallible?

148
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,358
Not me, personally.

149
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,991
I'm going... Maybe I'm at fault,
really. I'm not looking hard enough,

150
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,037
you can't have been
arrested for nothing.

151
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,953
Are you going to concoct
something to justify my arrest?

152
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,553
Closet Land

153
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,356
It hasn't been published yet, I'm still
working on it. Where did you get this?

154
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,196
You had my home search,
didn't you?

155
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,192
- Tell me about it.
- Why don't you read it?

156
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,592
It is interesting to hear writers
talk about their work.

157
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,635
- Hidden meanings surface...
- When you write for children,

158
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,394
you pretty much have to be direct,
there's no room for hidden meanings.

159
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,710
Children are remarkably
subtle creatures.

160
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,111
My stories are
harmless, cheerful.

161
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,595
Pieces of fluff, they have no more
depth than cotton candy.

162
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,358
Did you wreck my house?

163
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,353
Don't worry, it's fine.

164
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,074
They even cleaned your
house before they left.

165
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,513
There was some blood
on the toilet seat.

166
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,833
- Are you menstruating now?
- None of your business!

167
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,994
Thought not.

168
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,714
You see?

169
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,874
It's easier if you answer
my questions, isn't it?

170
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,678
You're in good health?

171
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,119
Do you have any physical
condition I should know about?

172
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,596
Are you on any medication?

173
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,190
You answer my questions
like a good little girl,

174
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,918
and I promise
I never do that again.

175
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,196
Don't call me good little girl!

176
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,035
I'm still waiting for the artist
to speak about her work.

177
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,198
Closet Land is about a child, who is
locked in a closet all day by her mother.

178
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,230
Little girl fantasizes that the
clothes are her imaginary friends.

179
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,073
They all have wonderful
parties in this closet,

180
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,593
this child and her friends,

181
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
and it becomes a sunny
meadow strewn

182
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,153
with wild strawberries
and beautiful flowers.

183
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,909
When it's time for her mother
to return from work,

184
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,629
the Friendly Rooster, which is
actually a scarf with a rooster design,

185
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,598
warns the little girl and her
friends by crowing loudly.

186
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,317
The clothes all go back
to their hangers,

187
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,879
and the child sits, quiet as a mouse,
waiting for her mother to let her out.

188
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,472
It's a curious story.

189
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,791
Very different from "The Flying Cow"
and "The Cat With Green Wings."

190
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,398
Were you a lonely child?

191
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,196
- No brothers or sisters?
- No, just my mother and me.

192
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,635
But your mother didn't
pay you much attention.

193
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,078
Well, she didn't mean not to,
she was just busy with her work

194
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,435
and her sunday literary groups.

195
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,076
You're still lonely, aren't you?

196
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,236
I don't trust lonely people.

197
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,232
Life's eternal spectators.

198
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,188
Watching.

199
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,959
Waiting.

200
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,474
- Were you afraid of your mother?
- No.

201
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,550
- We had a good relationship.
- Well, yes.

202
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,792
You were with her at her
bedside, when she died last year.

203
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,509
- What? - Where you accused
her of not noticing.

204
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,073
I've done what you asked, mama.
I've done all I could.

205
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,356
I've been there for you but
you've never been there for me.

206
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,592
You never noticed.
Just never noticed.

207
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,718
And then you stormed
out of the hospital.

208
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,039
- That night your mother died. Never
noticed what? - You've been spying

209
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,760
on me, haven't you?! Since last
year, maybe even before! Why?!

210
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,672
Why have my private
conversations been taped?!

211
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,673
I wasn't dragged here by mistake.
It is all part of some plan, isn't it?!

212
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,469
All conversations in all hospital
rooms are taped without exception.

213
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,190
We gain access to confessions, guilts,
longings, you name it, that we wouldn't

214
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,239
otherwise be privy to. Most of it is
sentimental drivel and is destroyed,

215
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,437
but the conversations between
writers, artists, political activists,

216
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,113
these are never destroyed.

217
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,358
Government policy.

218
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,114
Now...

219
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,434
...tell me...

220
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,312
What did your mother not notice?

221
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,634
What did your mother not notice?

222
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,753
Don't make a fuss.

223
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,955
Come on, it was just a tap.
Don't make a fuss.

224
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,279
- Some people have their eyes burnt with
cigarettes. - No, what you're going to...?

225
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,793
I don't smoke.

226
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,073
It'll pass.

227
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,597
Put your head on your knees.

228
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,115
Cover your ears lightly.

229
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,034
Better?

230
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,833
Shall we go on?

231
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,671
I need some water, please.

232
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,875
If you answer my questions.
What did your mother not notice?

233
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,871
Mothers and daughters
fight once in a while.

234
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,474
And when it's over, you can't
remember what it is about.

235
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,714
Don't hit me.

236
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,198
Oh, don't worry. It'll come back.

237
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,556
Let's talk about
Closet Land instead.

238
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,754
The child's locked in the
closet by her mother,

239
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,388
imagines that the clothes are
her friends and plays with them,

240
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,951
and the Friendly Rooster warns them
that the mother is on her way back.

241
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,351
The clothes go back to the racks and
the child waits to be let free. Is that it?

242
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,549
Yes.

243
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,829
Why was the child
locked in the closet?

244
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,712
I don't know.
I never thought about it.

245
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,199
Think now.

246
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,193
Maybe she ate too much cake

247
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,113
or spilled water-colours
on her mother's best dress.

248
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,512
And for this, a child gets
locked up in a closet?

249
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,511
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

250
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,515
Closet Land is a place where
people go for secret meetings!

251
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,036
Remember, the clothes don't come
alive until the child is alone with them!

252
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,354
When the Friendly Rooster,
who is on the lookout,

253
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,830
gives the warning cry,
they scatter and run away!

254
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,117
And when the mother comes back,
she can't find anything!

255
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,192
You've made the child a martyr
and the mother a tyrant!

256
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,035
Your sympathies are with the child, of
course, because you resent any authority!

257
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,069
- Do you object to my interpretation?
- No.

258
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,516
But that's all it is.
Your interpretation.

259
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,638
I can't control the messages people
choose to find in my stories.

260
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,916
There're people get turned
on by passages in the Bible.

261
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,432
Closet Land is a simple
children story.

262
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,036
It's not a simple word.

263
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,153
Just think...

264
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,920
Skeletons rattling in the closet.

265
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,196
It is a place where people hide, you say:
"closet homosexual, closet intellectual".

266
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,876
It's a dark, secret word.

267
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,233
Like the basement or space
under the bed at night.

268
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,313
All children's stories have
an element of horror in them.

269
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,597
Wicked dragons, evil witches.
I chose an everyday object.

270
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,718
A closet instead of a fantasy creature.
That's the only difference.

271
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,995
Children's authors aren't
political creatures

272
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,798
because children aren't!

273
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,355
Politics means big things!

274
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,469
Anyone who knows children knows that they
live for themselves and the present moment!

275
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,032
But children can be taught to find themselves
and the present moment within an ideology!

276
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,435
They're far more receptive
to suggestion than adults,

277
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,989
and that's what you tried
to do with the story.

278
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,590
- You are guilty of subliminal
indoctrination! - That's absurd!

279
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,273
- So, you don't support
the dissidents? - No.

280
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,477
- You're not the member of the underground?
- No. I'm not a political person!

281
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,713
Do you support us, then? Have you
supported what we've done for peace,

282
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,033
for order, for stability? - I told you
I know nothing about politics!

283
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,678
I thought you didn't smoke.

284
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,832
This is my first.

285
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,090
Who commissioned you to write the story?
Where is Closet Land? Who are the clothes

286
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,072
that come alive in the story? We already
have two turn-coats in custody.

287
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,515
The kindergarten teacher
and the physicist.

288
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,877
Who is the Friendly Rooster? How does
he know when "Mother" will come?

289
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,316
Is he in the government?
We have a few suspicions.

290
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,678
You're not one of those
anti-smoking activists, are you?

291
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,749
There.

292
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,837
You see, there was
no need for that.

293
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,588
You'll know if I'm
going to hurt you.

294
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,320
It's the suspense, not the pain,
that'll drive you mad.

295
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,473
You've changed.

296
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,434
Here.

297
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,550
- More?
- You said you'd tell me.

298
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,633
Never trust strangers.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

299
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
No, she never did!
I have... I have to rinse my mouth.

300
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,474
Sign this!

301
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,429
"I confess that my story,
Closet Land, is an allegory

302
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,673
for the struggles of the various
underground groups that are resisting

303
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,673
the government. The child-
-protagonist of the story

304
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,957
stands for the uninformed reader,
whose views I wish to mold.

305
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,830
I have consciously represented
governmental authority

306
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,118
in the character of the mother, and the
clothes are all underground insurgents.

307
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,669
The Friendly Rooster is a
government official."

308
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,869
- I can't sign that.
- Why?

309
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,712
It's a pack of lies!

310
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,637
I won't confess to a pack of lies,
and even if I do confess to this,

311
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,677
how do I know it'll stop here?

312
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,709
There'll be others,
more lies, won't there?

313
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,989
The Closet-Child knew
that she'd missed her chance,

314
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,469
when she could have opened
the door and glided out.

315
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,035
Whatever can the poor
Closet-Child do?

316
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,714
Bad man gives her
nothing to drink.

317
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,357
She is so parched that she'd even
drink the urine he offered her. So...

318
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,595
The Closet-Child did what all Closet-
-Children do when they're trapped.

319
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,475
She shut her eyes hard

320
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,319
and pretended that
she could glide out of Hell.

321
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,635
She knew there was a Passage
of Brightness right outside Hell,

322
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,870
and that the elves
had left a large pitcher

323
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,235
of fresh dew, just for her.

324
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,438
So, she pretended...

325
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,714
...that she was out in the
Passage, out drinking dew,

326
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,953
out of Hell.

327
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,071
<i>There has been estimated
that 96.8% of all women</i>

328
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,959
<i>who favour black underwear
are the closet-whores.</i>

329
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,835
<i>It has been estimated
that 97.3% of all women</i>

330
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,037
<i>who favour black underwear

331
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,151
<i>It has been estimated
that 99, 10% of all women</i>

332
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,676
<i>who favour black underwear
are closet-whores.</i>

333
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,718
<i>Do you know that a
105.9% of all women</i>

334
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,872
<i>who favour black underwear
are closet-whores?</i>

335
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,070
<i>Uh-oh, You can't hide
from us, precious.</i>

336
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,358
<i>Why don't you give up?</i>

337
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,195
<i>The doors here don't open.
But didn't you know that?</i>

338
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,673
<i>Doors lead in,
doors lead out.</i>

339
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,440
<i>Doors no wider
than a little girl's hat.</i>

340
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,160
<i>Doors lead out,
doors lead in.</i>

341
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,030
<i>Doors no bigger than
a little girl's chin.</i>

342
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,350
Give me my clothes!

343
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,115
<i>Sign the confession or suck my dick.
Which do you please, you tease?</i>

344
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,792
<i>By the way.
When was the last time?</i>

345
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,557
<i>Our Friendly Neighborhood
Sex-watch says</i>

346
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,033
<i>your last time was
when you fucked... ha ha...</i>

347
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,351
<i>...tried to fuck... some
guy two years ago.</i>

348
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,718
Stop it, stop it!

349
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,150
<i>Even fossils show more
signs of life, dear heart.</i>

350
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,357
<i>But you're worse than a fossil.</i>

351
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,470
<i>You are frigid. We know,
we've seen you at action.</i>

352
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,392
<i>You can't do it, can you?</i>

353
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,275
<i>You are not normal.
You are warped.</i>

354
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,711
<i>You are sick.
You are bad.</i>

355
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,072
<i>You've always been bad.</i>

356
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,798
<i>That's why your mother didn't notice.
That's why men don't want you.</i>

357
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,198
<i>Who wants a cold,
unresponsive whore?</i>

358
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,560
<i>All they want to do
slam the door and leave.</i>

359
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,236
<i>All they want to do
slam the door and leave.</i>

360
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,790
<i>Step up in front of
the image, please.</i>

361
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,354
<i>Step up in front of
the image, please.</i>

362
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,877
<i>You are hereby accused of
conspiracy against your country</i>

363
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,713
<i>and against peace,
order and stability.</i>

364
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,953
<i>Your story, Closet Land,
is thinly-veiled propaganda</i>

365
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,078
<i>designed to stir dissent
in the hearts of children.</i>

366
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,113
<i>All official avenues of
redress have been sealed.</i>

367
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,475
<i>Your Rights
have been suspended.</i>

368
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,152
<i>The short term goal is to
have you sign the confession.</i>

369
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,556
<i>And the long-term goal...
...that will depend...</i>

370
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,679
<i>...on the success of
the short term goal.</i>

371
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,549
<i>You do not merit a name
or identity.</i>

372
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,553
<i>You are henceforth be
referred to by a number:</i>

373
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,473
<i>AB234.</i>

374
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,952
Oh-leh.

375
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,033
What went on here?

376
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,070
Where are your clothes?
What's all this paint on your face?

377
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,113
Maybe your boys got bored
and wanted some fun.

378
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,310
We are not allowed to subject
anyone to any harassment

379
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,631
outside the context
of standard interrogation.

380
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,591
I'm sorry. I'll look into it.

381
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,673
Want some broth?

382
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,795
No.

383
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,797
Someone else will take over now.

384
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,471
I'd advise you to be straight
with him, he is not very patient.

385
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,068
But don't worry.

386
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,079
You'll be fine.

387
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,434
No! No blindfold, please!

388
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,233
- Are you scared of the dark?
- It feels like...

389
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,399
It feels what?

390
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,353
Why don't you question me?
I don't want this other man.

391
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,114
- We work in shifts.
- Why do I have to be blindfolded?

392
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,068
Because he's an undercover officer.
And we can't run the risk of your

393
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,351
identifying him later. - I won't
say anything. I promise.

394
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,111
Relax. I have to do this.
I don't want to use force.

395
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,829
They're watching me, too.

396
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,194
- Prisoner AB234.
- Chocked gutter.

397
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,830
Who is the Friendly Rooster?

398
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,474
When the clock struck five,

399
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,353
the Friendly Rooster
awoke from his nap.

400
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,077
Mommie would be coming
back from work.

401
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,949
The Closet-Child was
playing with the Overcoat

402
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,839
and his children, the Mittens.

403
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,754
Friendly Rooster shook
his feathers.

404
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,676
He must warn them
before mommie arrives.

405
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,238
Who is the Friendly
Rooster, AB234?

406
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,197
He is just a character
of my story.

407
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,679
Stupid cow!

408
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,038
Tell the truth!

409
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,118
I don't know.

410
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,988
I don't know.

411
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,837
You didn't want me, did you, huh?

412
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,072
You wanted that other guy.

413
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,516
I heard you telling him.

414
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,108
"Don't go."

415
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,197
"You question me."

416
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,070
I saw that in a movie once.

417
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,994
So you do not know
who the Friendly Rooster is?

418
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,315
No!

419
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,789
Prisoner XYZ!

420
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,994
- Do you recognize this woman here?
- Yes, your excellency.

421
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,310
And who is she, prisoner XYZ?

422
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,677
She is in charge of our child
propaganda division, your grace.

423
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,717
He's lying!
I don't know who he is.

424
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,595
What are the aims of
your group, prisoner XYZ?

425
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,712
- We are planning to overthrow the
government, your honour. - Liar! Who are you?

426
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,590
Yeah. Answer her, prisoner
XYZ. Who are you?

427
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,519
What was your code name?

428
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,748
I was called...

429
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,151
...the Friendly Rooster, your virtuosity.

430
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,354
He's lying.

431
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,597
You've heard that
your fellow rebel said?

432
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,354
- That's not true! I don't know...
- Shut up!

433
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,636
- You have been brought here,
because you're guilty! - I am innocent!

434
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,075
Even if you are you'll be
guilty before you leave!

435
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,075
But don't leave just yet,
prisoner AB234.

436
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,920
Just yet there's plenty
more to come.

437
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,911
We're gonna have
a barbecue, okay?

438
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,657
No, your highness! No, not a barbecue,
your pulchritude! Please!

439
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,549
What I am doing,
prisoner AB234,

440
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,629
I'm inserting a red-hot skewer

441
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,429
into the Friendly Rooster's ass.

442
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,516
We line up roast
chicken in a minute.

443
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,308
And then I'm gonna pluck out
his fingernails with a pair of pliers

444
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,550
as just as his toes last week.

445
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,679
The tuffest part
is getting a good grip.

446
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,670
But once you have the nails
steady and firm then, you just tug.

447
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,478
And keep tugging, never
mind him, keep tugging,

448
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,349
until you hear a crack and
the nail is on its way out.

449
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,670
And these pink flesh underneath.

450
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,636
Pink as a baby's ass.

451
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,433
Like yours, AB234...

452
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,231
...before the innocence have gone...

453
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,151
...before you knew the world...

454
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,032
...a man's touch.

455
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,553
Wolf-whistles.

456
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,956
You must have been
a pretty child.

457
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,597
- He's gone.
- Are you all right?

458
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,672
Oh, yeah.

459
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,833
Thanks for asking.

460
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,634
I've been done so often
my skin thickened.

461
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,390
The first time's the worst. It burns so
much you feel like you're in hell.

462
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,156
- Where are you?
- Over here, to your right.

463
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,270
I mean to your left. I forgot your
right for my left and vice versa.

464
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,876
Your versas are my
vices and versa vice...

465
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,832
Why did you lie about me?

466
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,032
I'm the resident witness.

467
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,309
They drag me up when they want
to incriminate someone.

468
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,756
I used to resist,
not anymore.

469
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,197
- Have you been barbecued yet?
- No.

470
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,236
- What have they tried on you? Cat's
cradle, arabesque? - What are they?

471
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,335
Don't even think about that. Not
even when it's happening to you.

472
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,496
Think of something else. You've
got something pleasant you can

473
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:51,693
think about? - The cat
with green wings.

474
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,436
Well, think about that,
whatever that is.

475
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,554
Take your mind right away
from what they're doing to you.

476
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,879
Have you ever done that before?

477
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,518
When I was a little girl. The
closet my stories came to...

478
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,517
He will be coming for me soon.

479
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,394
Listen...

480
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,678
...there's another man here.

481
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,796
He is a different sort
for a place like this.

482
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,872
- Yes, he questioned me first.
- He did?

483
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,237
Why didn't you beg for mercy?
That's all he wants.

484
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,237
He could've let you go.

485
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,676
He's not so bad, really.

486
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,673
He used to be a professor

487
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,400
of some sort before
they got him.

488
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,358
He plays the piano.

489
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,314
They're coming.

490
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,998
Listen, if he comes to
question you again...

491
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,355
...throw yourself at his feet.

492
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,758
It's your only hope.

493
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,348
Goodbye.

494
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,839
Hello.

495
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,555
Hello.

496
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,313
Help me! Please!

497
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,156
I'm innocent, please.

498
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,749
I beg of you! Let me go.

499
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,673
Please.

500
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,036
I don't like all this, you know.

501
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,794
I tell myself: It's just a job, and
then in my dreams these words...

502
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,239
...float by.

503
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,796
"Because thou hast the power
and own'st the grace

504
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,879
To look through and behind
this mask of me,

505
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,189
Against which, years have beat
thus blanchingly, with their rains,

506
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,708
and behold my
soul's true face..."

507
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,438
Seems so long ago...

508
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,831
...my soul's true face.

509
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,078
You know what I'm going to do?

510
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,471
I don't care who's watching me.

511
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,471
I'm going to open that door...

512
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,271
...let you walk away...

513
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,798
...into the night.

514
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,398
What's up?

515
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,757
Nothing. Nothing.

516
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,074
Good.

517
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,478
Let's get these
handcuff off, then.

518
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,909
Keys.

519
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,478
Where are the handcuff keys?

520
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,318
You have no right
to make joke of this!

521
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,636
Our aim is to rid society
of negative influences.

522
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,268
Our aim justifies the use of
certain unorthodox means.

523
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,750
Your aim is to humiliate
and debace the human being!

524
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,717
- There is no justification for cruelty!
- Our aim...

525
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,836
...is to rid society of
negative influences.

526
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,878
Our aim justifies the use of
certain unorthodox means.

527
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,077
Your aim is to humiliate
and debace the human being!

528
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,196
There is no justification
for cruelty!

529
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,592
Your aim is to humiliate
and debace the human being!

530
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,355
There is no justification
for cruelty!

531
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,310
- There is no justification for cruelty!
- Our aim...

532
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,436
...is to rid society of
negative influences.

533
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,309
There is no justification
for cruelty of any kind...

534
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,758
Are you in good health?

535
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,272
Do you have any physical condition
that I should know about?

536
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,035
Are you on any medication?

537
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,109
Do you know...

538
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,433
...that 97.5% of women who
wear black underwear

539
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,353
are closet whores?

540
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,511
Think about something pleasant to take
your mind off what they're doing to you.

541
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,191
Friendly Rooster, for instance.

542
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,269
He wakes up only once at night.
He sleeps like a baby.

543
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,437
But he looks like... They look
like angels, don't you think?

544
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,359
And then they grow up
and then nothing but heartache.

545
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,512
- Aren't you trying for a girl?
- May I have liked two.

546
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,114
But my wife says
she went through the hell.

547
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,113
- They always do.
- Give her time. A couple of years.

548
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,552
My daughter swore she'd never have
another. She's three months pregnant.

549
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,039
We're giving him fruit now. It was
hard first but he is getting taste it

550
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,919
Go easy, though you don't
wanna give him diarrhea.

551
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,833
I still remember when my daughter
first discovered bananas.

552
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,433
- I miss him when I'm away.
- Yeah. - He misses me, too.

553
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,670
- When I come home he smiles.
- Yeah. - He looks like a little monkey.

554
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,639
The night supervisor asked me to
work next weekend, but I said no.

555
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,472
Yeah, I remember what he said.

556
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,632
"In a few years you'll do
anything to get away."

557
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,992
<i>We must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

558
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,794
<i>Pain ennobles both the
giver and the receiver.</i>

559
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,911
<i>Discipline will remain government
policy as long as you resist.</i>

560
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,234
<i>Resistance is foolish...</i>

561
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,155
<i>...which is why we must break
your body to win your mind.</i>

562
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,636
<i>We must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

563
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,598
When was I brought here?

564
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,909
When do you think?

565
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,757
It feels like two months...

566
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,640
...years, two lifetimes.

567
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,913
- Two life times.
- What?

568
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,233
We brought you here
two life times ago.

569
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,354
No, I'm joking. You've
only been here two years.

570
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,228
Two years?

571
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,750
Two years in this closet.

572
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,190
Yes, and your mother
died last week.

573
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,077
We took you to
the hospital, but...

574
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,432
- She never noticed.
- You liar.

575
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,270
Mama died last year.
I was brought here last night.

576
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,798
We're going to play a game.

577
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,028
You respond to my questions with the first word
that comes to your mind. It's called: touchdown.

578
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,713
Touchdown.

579
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,108
Closet.

580
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,549
Dark.

581
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,513
Stories.

582
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,034
Closet.

583
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,916
- Did you write your
stories in the closet? - No.

584
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,549
- So? - My stories
come from the closet.

585
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,435
Mother.

586
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,359
Nowhere.

587
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,351
- And she died last year.
- No personal observations, please.

588
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,789
Sex.

589
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,189
Pain.

590
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,719
Politics.

591
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,799
Politics.

592
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,871
- Politics.
- None.

593
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,354
Government.

594
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,909
Abuse.

595
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,195
- Government.
- Carrying, loving, just.

596
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,270
- Mind.
- Government property.

597
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,552
- Opposition.
- Futile.

598
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,999
- Sleep.
- Death.

599
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,309
No. I meant go to sleep.

600
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,951
Sleep is death.

601
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,550
<i>We must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

602
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,829
<i>Pain ennobles both the
giver and the receiver.</i>

603
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,275
<i>Discipline will remain government
policy as long as you resist.</i>

604
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,199
<i>Resistance is foolish.
Which is why...</i>

605
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,396
Sleep is death.

606
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,597
Sleep is death.

607
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,437
<i>We must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

608
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,315
<i>Pain ennobles...</i>

609
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,993
Sleep is death.

610
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,356
Sleep is death.

611
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,459
<i>Discipline will remain government
policy as long as you resist.</i>

612
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,799
<i>Resistance is foolish
which is why...</i>

613
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,839
Are you like me?

614
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,471
<i>We must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

615
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,035
<i>Pain ennobles both the
giver and the receiver.</i>

616
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,955
<i>Discipline will remain
government policy...</i>

617
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,997
I'm not alone.

618
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,230
<i>...as long as you resist.
Resistance is foolish...</i>

619
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,308
Keep whistling.

620
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,674
<i>We must break your body...</i>

621
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,193
Keep whistling.

622
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,193
Keep whistling.

623
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,910
<i>Pain ennobles both the
giver and the receiver.</i>

624
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,512
<i>Discipline will remain
government policy...</i>

625
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,193
Sleep is death.

626
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,599
<i>Resistance is foolish...</i>

627
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,874
Pain will only
strengthen my will.

628
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,433
You can break my body, but
you cannot break my mind.

629
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,915
Torture is the policy of tyrants.

630
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,756
Resistance is my only weapon.

631
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,388
You can break my body, but
you cannot break my mind.

632
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,189
Pain will only
strengthen my will.

633
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,959
Torture is the policy of tyrants.

634
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,477
Resistance is my only weapon.

635
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,993
You can break my body, but
you cannot break my mind.

636
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,190
Pain will only temper my will.

637
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,154
Torture is the policy of tyrants.

638
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,035
Pain will only
strengthen my will.

639
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,795
Torture is the policy of tyrants.

640
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,269
They tell me you're
being stubborn.

641
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,198
You should sleep, you know.

642
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,548
- Listen to the tape and fall asleep.
- Sleep is death.

643
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,191
Well, it's a waiting game, then.

644
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,950
You've been here two months,
sooner or later, you will fall asleep.

645
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,953
- I was brought here last night.
- Just think...

646
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,116
...two months without sleep.

647
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,233
Sixty days.

648
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,431
1440 hours.

649
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,478
You're lying. They brought
me here last night.

650
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,711
- Why should I lie about this?
- To confuse me.

651
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,428
To break my will, sometimes
you lie. For the hell of it.

652
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,399
Do your eyes hurt?

653
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,429
<i>Relax.</i>

654
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,550
<i>Let your shoulders light.</i>

655
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,678
<i>Rest your neck.</i>

656
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,878
<i>Let that roll easily
against your chair.</i>

657
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,868
<i>Don't resist.</i>

658
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,911
<i>Your muscles are stiff by tension.</i>

659
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,793
<i>Release that.</i>

660
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,153
<i>Let them flow like gentle stream,</i>

661
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,072
<i>like distant sea.</i>

662
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,633
<i>We must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

663
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,509
<i>Pain ennobles both the
giver and the receiver.</i>

664
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,434
<i>Discipline will remain government
policy as long as you resist.</i>

665
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,029
You can break my body but
you can't break my mind.

666
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,475
Will you sign this?

667
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,355
No.

668
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,750
- You are forcing me.
- To do what?

669
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:42,318
Things I don't want to do.

670
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,869
Doesn't that bother you to see someone
stretched out in front of you?

671
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,670
Aren't you worried
that this is your job,

672
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,149
that you do it without question?

673
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,916
Most men go to work in offices and
factories and you come here instead.

674
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,911
What made you this way?

675
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,314
Is it what they did to you?

676
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,949
Or is it a hidden sickness?

677
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,990
Some inner decay?

678
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,668
<i>Resistance is foolish
which is why</i>

679
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,754
<i>we must break your
body to win your mind.</i>

680
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,956
You can break my body but
you can't break my mind.

681
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,156
You can break my body but
you can't break my mind!

682
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,709
Right! Right!

683
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,674
Haven't you had enough?

684
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,149
Why don't you just sign?
Come on, give me break.

685
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,355
No.

686
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,833
What's that?

687
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,759
No.

688
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,913
That's what I thought you said.

689
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,390
Why do you refuse?
It is such a small thing.

690
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,877
Just a signature.

691
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,878
Think of it as an autograph...

692
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,675
...to a secret admirer.

693
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,988
No.

694
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,074
Thank you.

695
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,991
Children have to be
taught a firm lesson.

696
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,075
My God.

697
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,314
It's a closet land.
A flying cow.

698
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,756
The cat with green wings and friendly
roos... Whistle for me, please!

699
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,668
Whistle!

700
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,156
The closet. The closet.
There is no pain in Closet Land.

701
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,709
When your head aches,
a mushroom...

702
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,195
Whistle for me, please!

703
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,433
You don't answer...

704
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,149
Your toe-nails hurt?!
Poor child!

705
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,870
Get the cow, the cat
with green wings!

706
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,431
I got to the home of the cat.
The cat with green wings.

707
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,833
I got away. I got away.

708
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,800
I got away. It's a closet land.

709
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,557
Where is closet land?

710
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,956
It's in my mind.

711
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,309
You can break my body but
you can't break my mind.

712
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,789
As long as I can go to closet land,
all you have are my bones.

713
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,636
- Who lives there?
- My friends.

714
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,752
A flying cow.

715
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,752
A friendly rooster.
A cat with green wings.

716
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:31,157
I knew them since I was a child.
I'd close my eyes thight...

717
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:37,996
And I go away
and they come to me.

718
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,758
Floating in the air.

719
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,551
Why were you in the closet?

720
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,829
A man...

721
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,759
Mama's friend...

722
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,474
...he used to have
breakfast on Sunday.

723
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,312
I take the coats and scarves
and hang them up in the closet.

724
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,432
And that's when he...

725
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,513
When I was in the closet,
hanging up his coat,

726
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,511
that's when it first happened.

727
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,912
He used to smile after it was over,
like it was a secret between us.

728
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,079
I was five.

729
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,039
- Your mother never noticed?
- No.

730
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:52,556
No. She never noticed, poor
mama. Trusting, foolish mama.

731
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,652
Striding around.

732
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,320
I was too scared to tell...
The man. He said:

733
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,711
He would cut away my tongue
and chop off my head.

734
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,996
So every Sunday,
when he came...

735
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,916
...and visited I'd go to the closet...

736
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,558
...and I'd wait for him.

737
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,117
I'd shut my eyes tight...

738
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,518
...the church bells
used to ring...

739
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,392
...and my friends came to me.
The flying cow.

740
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,477
The cat with green wings.

741
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,879
I was even able to forget that he was
there with his hands under my dress.

742
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,679
I wonder...

743
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,153
...if you know, really know...

744
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,549
...the strength of your mind.

745
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,793
Most people break down
in a matter of hours...

746
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,355
...and you've escaped from us...

747
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,239
...on the back of a flying cow...

748
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,074
...and a cat with wings.

749
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,758
You're a strange and uniqe case...

750
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,717
...AB234.

751
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,034
We must go to closet land.

752
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,471
You're back in your
mother's closet, AB234.

753
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,435
You're back in your
mother's closet, AB234.

754
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,279
It's dark. You can't see a thing.

755
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,715
It's dark. You can't see a thing.

756
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,838
And you closed your eyes anyway,
because you can hear his footsteps.

757
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,989
You're back in your
mother's closet, AB234.

758
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,190
I know you like it, little creep.

759
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,717
Only five. And the eyes
of a whore.

760
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,549
Dear child, sweet, loyal child.

761
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,989
I know you like it, little creep.

762
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,551
Only five. And the eyes
of a whore.

763
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,958
Dear child, dear child,
sweet, loyal child.

764
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,636
<i>Here comes the candle
to light you to bed.</i>

765
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:06,751
<i>And here comes the chopper
to chop off your head.</i>

766
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,914
It's you.

767
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,629
Scream.

768
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,989
Scream.

769
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,514
Scream.

770
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,078
You won't scream.
You never did, not even then.

771
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,519
Such a knowing look
in such young eyes.

772
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,636
What made you this way?

773
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,358
Some hidden streak?
An inner sickness?

774
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,276
You had no hips then.

775
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,109
Tiny ribs like a sparrow's bones.

776
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,397
I could've broken them all
with one rough caress.

777
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,997
Sugarplum heart, beating
wildly in its cage.

778
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,990
Everything so small, so perfect.

779
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,710
You took away my innocence, too.

780
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,033
But when you grew up
and had other lovers

781
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,031
and when they touched you
and breathed your name

782
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,397
you froze and thought of me.

783
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,079
"Because thou hast the power
and own'st the grace

784
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,470
To see through and behind
this mask of me,

785
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,349
Against which, years have beat
thus blanchingly, with their rains,

786
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,116
and behold my
soul's true face..."

787
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:25,472
My soul's true face.

788
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,315
Why?

789
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,314
Why?!

790
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,191
Is that why you have
brought me here?

791
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,598
To finish what you started
when I was a child?

792
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,196
You are here as a dissident, you're
part of the tribe that thinks too much.

793
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,557
- If you'd continued writing
about flying pigs... - Cows.

794
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,755
Cows.

795
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,998
About flying cows and winged
cats, you'd have been safe,

796
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,878
but then we found Closet Land.

797
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,870
And when I'm back, right
start it, won't they?

798
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,515
I invented closet land
when you abused a child

799
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,557
and being punished now
after all these years

800
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,676
because I created closet land.

801
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,272
This must have been going
on here for ages, right? I mean...

802
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:35,871
The sudden intrusions at night. Always
at night I suppose, and the arrest.

803
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,998
Senseless charges...

804
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,673
...and brutality. I never knew...

805
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,308
...or else I didn't wanna,
I didn't wanna see.

806
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,113
I shut my eyes like
I did in the closet.

807
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,231
That woman down the street...

808
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,153
...a journalist.

809
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,351
About a couple of months ago
she disappeared. Vanished.

810
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,478
The maid said so. And we
all went on with our lives.

811
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,995
I remember going to
lunch with my publisher.

812
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,993
And here is this woman,
someone I never really knew,

813
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,436
I'd seen on the street, said
hello to even. Just gone.

814
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,910
They he came for her mother next.

815
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:31,030
An 80-year-old, toothless invalid.

816
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,268
Some men were searching
this missing journalist's house

817
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,829
while her mother set outside
on the street like trash,

818
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,833
waiting to be picked up. We all
passed her on the way to work.

819
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,319
I know I did.

820
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,674
And the old woman looked at me, in
the eye, I looked back, but I didn't see.

821
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,039
None of us did.

822
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,270
We just didn't notice.

823
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,959
Like my mama.

824
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,515
It seems to be the same thing, really.

825
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:13,753
Shutting a child in a closet,
and shutting a people away.

826
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,117
If you can frighten a child into silence,
you can frighten a people, too...

827
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,909
...and with time, they'll shut
their eyes and not scream.

828
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,640
I never screamed
in the closet, did I?

829
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,514
And the people won't
scream either.

830
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,997
They will go around pretending
everything's fine, everything's all right,

831
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,310
while their neighbours
disappear all around them.

832
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,074
And then they will
become like children...

833
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,350
Scared of bad men, the chopper
that'll chop off their heads.

834
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,749
That's what's so
terrifying because...

835
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,917
...children are so powerless.

836
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,435
And make such easy victims.

837
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,638
Such easy victims.

838
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,839
If I told you...

839
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,553
...that this is your last chance...

840
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,869
...that everything is at stake.

841
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,869
Everything.

842
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:42,508
Would you sign?

843
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,638
How do you shut a mind?

844
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,910
They cut out his tongue but
he found a way he whistled.

845
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,469
Then they found a way, that's
why he couldn't whistle to you!

846
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,916
Today, one little injection. He was
a physicist! Look at him now!

847
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,193
Not a care in the world!
Not a thought in his head!

848
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,308
And look at his eyes!

849
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,717
His empty, empty eyes!

850
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:40,199
It's all of pack of lies,
anyway, so sign it!

851
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,117
What do you care?
It's just a pack of lies!

852
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,155
"Today, over half the world's
governments continue to use

853
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,232
torture against their own citizens."
