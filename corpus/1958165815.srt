1
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,168
EVERY 350,000 YEARS,
THE COMET, BAY-LEDER 7,

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:39,172
PASSES EARTH SO CLOSELY, IT
CAN BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE.

3
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,640
TONIGHT, THE WAIT IS OVER.

4
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:44,477
ASTRONOMERS ARE TELLING US THAT WE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE COMET...

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,147
YOU KNOW, DAD, MOST MEN
WHO ARE HAVING A HUGE PARTY,

6
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,116
THROWN IN THEIR HONOR, WOULD BE
AT THE PARTY ENJOYING IT

7
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,452
AND NOT STANDING ON THE BALCONY
LOOKING AT BIRDS.

8
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,588
ANNA, BAY-LEDER 7 IS MAKING
ITS CLOSEST PATH TO EARTH,

9
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,491
AND I'M WATCHING FROM A BALCONY,
NOT FROM A TELESCOPE.

10
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,461
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY
FOR DISCOVERING IT.

11
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,529
- I DIDN'T DISCOVER IT.

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,566
YEAH, THE INSTITUTE DID...
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

13
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,135
ECKER PUT THAT AWAY.

14
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,374
Sergeant Parker,
it looks like we have

15
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,409
a breach of security
on the third floor...

16
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,378
two unidentified subjects.

17
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,415
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS PARKER.
I'M ON IT. OVER.

18
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,151
BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE,
YOUR CHARITY WORK, AND POLITICS,

19
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,520
IF YOU DON'T START
TAKING TIME TO RELAX,

20
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,489
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A HEART ATTACK,

21
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,825
AND THEN THERE WILL BE
NO ONE AROUND YOU TO RUN IT.

22
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,693
- YES, THERE WILL.
- WHO? ME?

23
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,198
THE STAFF LOVES YOU
AND RESPECTS YOU.

24
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,666
- WHAT ABOUT HINTZE?

25
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:43,570
HINTZE IS A BRAVE MAN,
BUT HE HAS NO VISION.

26
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,838
HE'S NOT LIKE YOU.

27
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,807
- I JUST...

28
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,509
THEY KNOW, DAD.

29
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,644
I'M NOT A LEADER.

30
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,580
- YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED.

31
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,416
UH, EXCUSE ME, THIS AREA
IS RESERVED FOR EMBASSY STAFF.

32
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,552
I'M SORRY. WE'RE JUST HAVING
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE COMET.

33
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,687
I'M SORRY, DR. STARNDORF.
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOU.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,755
UH, THIS IS CAPTAIN PARKER.
YEAH, I FOUND OUR STRAYS.

35
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,525
IT'S DOCTOR STARNDORF AND HIS DAUGHTER.
- They're cleared.

36
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,559
- YEAH, I'VE GOT IT. OVER.

37
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,495
DR. STARNDORF, PLEASE,
STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

38
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,631
WHEN YOU'RE READY, I'LL
ESCORT YOU BACK TO THE PARTY.

39
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,600
- UH, MISTER...?

40
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,568
PARKER...
CAPTAIN TOM PARKER, SIR.

41
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,437
SO, CAPTAIN PARKER,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

42
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,440
I MEAN, THE BAY-LEDER
IS SO CLOSE FROM HERE

43
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,441
AS IF I'M... I'M SORRY.

44
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,475
STARNDORF.

45
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,912
WHAT?

46
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,449
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

47
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,451
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
COME ON, ANNA.

48
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,521
I'M SORRY.
- CERTAINLY, SIR.

49
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,823
- GOODBYE, CAPTAIN PARKER.
- BYE-BYE.

50
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,542
- Hello?

51
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,576
- SANDRA PARKER?

52
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,877
YES, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

53
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,712
- OH, IT'S TOO BAD, YOU KNOW?

54
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,615
I WAS EXPECTING A CALL
FROM MY SECRET LOVER.

55
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,517
UH, NO, NO.

56
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,619
I'M AFRAID HE'S BEING
TORTURED TO DEATH RIGHT NOW.

57
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,921
- WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS

58
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,989
I'M GONNA JUST
GET MYSELF ANOTHER ONE.

59
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,791
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH ME, HONEY.

60
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,526
I'LL MAKE DO
WITH YOU THIS EVENING.

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,495
All right, I'm working.
I got to go.

62
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,729
KISS THE PRINCESS FOR ME.

63
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,499
YEAH, SHE'S JUST ABOUT
READY FOR BED.

64
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,767
- ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,835
- YOU TOO. BYE.

66
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,816
SIR, OUR CALCULATIONS
WERE CORRECT...

67
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,951
UP UNTIL THREE HOURS AGO.

68
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,652
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME SOONER?

69
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,954
YOU'RE MY
CHIEF ENGINEER, HINTZE.

70
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,655
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A SYSTEM ERROR.

71
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,524
THE BAY-LEDER'S TRAJECTORY
HAS CHANGED.

72
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,593
- GRAVITATIONAL SPIKE FROM EARTH?

73
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,794
- PROBABLY.

74
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,861
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN IN-SPACE COLLISION

75
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,663
WITH AN UNCHARTED ASTEROID...

76
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,832
IT HIT IT HARD ENOUGH
TO PUSH IT OFF-COURSE.

77
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,968
WHATEVER THIS IS,
THIS IS JUST GREAT.

78
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,704
OKAY, LET'S
RECALCULATE THE COURSE.

79
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,741
- NO, NO, NO.

80
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,410
NO, THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.
- OH, MY GOD.

81
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,612
- HOW MUCH TIME?

82
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,518
GET NASA ALONG WITH
EVERY GOVERNMENT

83
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,654
IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
ON THE LINE.

84
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:15,888
I SHALL CALL COLONEL WATERS.

85
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,810
- HONEY?

86
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,412
HONEY.

87
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,748
HI. HI, SWEETHEART.

88
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,786
- TELL ME THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

89
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,521
- EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

90
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,556
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
- YEAH.

91
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,892
- BE RIGHT BACK.
- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, SWEETIE.

92
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,867
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE ON
A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE TODAY.

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,669
- COLONEL, BELIEVE YOU, WE KNOW,

94
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,470
BUT WE LITERALLY HAVE
ONLY ONE SHOT ON THIS.

95
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,572
WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE
A WATER PISTOL TO THE SUN.

96
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,840
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IT'S GONNA WORK?

97
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,643
REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE ONE
THAT WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS,

98
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,614
AND WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IT
WITH AN OVERSIZE MICROWAVE OVEN?

99
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,915
NO, I DON'T
THINK IT'S GONNA WORK.

100
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,785
NOW, LISTEN TO ME NOW,
"MR. HANSON," IS IT?

101
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,586
- HINTZE.
- HINTZE.

102
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,655
YEAH, WELL, I WOULD NEVER
ENTRUST NATIONAL SECURITY

103
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,457
TO A MICROWAVE OVEN.

104
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,626
SolStar-2 RESPONDING,
ADJUSTING, TARGETING.

105
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,561
EMERGENCY BIRTH IN 30 SECONDS.

106
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,497
GENTLEMEN, WE MAY BE
ABOUT TO SAVE THE WORLD TODAY.

107
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,899
- COLONEL, DO YOU PRAY?

108
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,501
-20 SECONDS.
- NOT LATELY.

109
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,769
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO START AGAIN.

110
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,604
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- SHUT UP, HINTZE!

111
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,775
THERE ARE THINGS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

112
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:48,514
SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE, ZERO.

113
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,695
WE'LL FLY OUT OF HERE
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

114
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,763
LET'S GET GOING.
- WHERE?

115
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,099
THEY THINK
THE COMET'S GONNA HIT

116
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,800
SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN RUSSIA,
SO SOUTH, I GUESS.

117
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,769
OKAY, WELL,
THEN I GOT TO PACK.

118
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,636
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

119
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,438
NO LUGGAGE...
THERE'S NO ROOM, OKAY?

120
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,940
THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST.

121
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,509
SCIENTISTS HAVE CONFIRMED
THAT THE COMET

122
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,511
WILL IMPACT EARTH
SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN EUROPE

123
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,645
WITHIN HOURS.

124
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,748
CITIZENS HAVE BEEN ADVISED
TO EVACUATE...

125
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,785
WE'RE GOING ON A LITTLE TRIP,
SWEETHEART.

126
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,494
IN LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT
TO DESTROY THE COMET,

127
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,731
A TOP-SECRET MICROWAVE-BEAM
WEAPON HAS APPARENTLY BEEN USED.

128
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,834
IT APPEARS
THE WEAPON HAS FAILED.

129
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:46,806
AT THIS BASE, ALONE, NO LESS
THAN 50 C-17 AND C-130 AIRCRAFT

130
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,844
HAVE BEEN SENT TO CITIES LIKE
COPENHAGEN, OSLO, AND BERLIN

131
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,514
TO EVACUATE AMERICAN PERSONNEL.

132
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:59,852
FROM RAMSTEIN AIR FORCE BASE,
THIS IS JOHN ELKIN REPORTING.

133
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,782
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES
SPEAK OF OVER 4 BILLION DEAD

134
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,551
AND MOST OF NORTHERN EURASIA
BECOMING UNINHABITABLE,

135
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,220
POSSIBLY
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

136
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,955
- YOU CAN'T SEE THE SUN ANYMORE.

137
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,557
THE SKY IS PITCH BLACK
IN PRAGUE AT 2:00 P.M.

138
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,859
ANNA VOLKOVA FOR CTN BULGARIA.

139
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,861
MAJOR INCIDENTS
OF LOOTING WERE REPORTED

140
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,929
IN WARSAW, BERLIN,
DRESDEN, AND KIEV

141
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,231
ONLY MINUTES AFTER THE IMPACT.

142
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,665
- COMMUNICATION IN EUROPE

143
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,901
IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED
TO SATELLITE CELLPHONES NOW,

144
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,302
AND THEY'RE BECOMING
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT

145
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,604
TO GET BATTERY POWER.

146
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,738
- ...HAVE RELOCATED TO TANGIER.

147
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,007
U.N. OFFICIALS HAVE STATED
THAT THEY EXPECT

148
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,242
A NEW GOVERNING BODY
OF WHAT ONCE WAS EUROPE

149
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,677
TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED
WITHIN DAYS NOW.

150
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,212
TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED
BELOW ZERO WITHIN HOURS,

151
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,248
AND THE BLACK SNOW RESUMES
IN NUCLEAR FALLOUT.

152
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,883
THE CLOUD OVER CENTRAL EUROPE

153
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,851
IS DEFLECTING
85% OF THE SUNLIGHT.

154
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,653
- ..ICE AGE.

155
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,989
ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS,
EARTH FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE

156
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,357
AND A VERY LONG WINTER.

157
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,886
COME ON, GET UP.

158
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,897
NOW, THIS AREA
IS FOR DIPLOMATS ONLY, OKAY?

159
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,866
YOU GUYS STAY HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

160
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,668
- WH-WHY CAN'T WE COME WITH YOU?

161
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,836
I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS SITUATION FIRST.

162
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,339
I'LL COME RIGHT BACK.
I PROMISE, OKAY?

163
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,343
HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
SWEETIE. IT'S OKAY.

164
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,913
YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

165
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,750
- I need clearance now.

166
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,952
Can you hear me?

167
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,219
I need clearance.

168
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,254
- NO! NO.

169
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,889
FORGET CLEARANCE!

170
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:54,393
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS PLANE
MOVING RIGHT NOW.

171
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,868
- I CAN'T LEAVE.

172
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,270
MY FATHER'S STILL HERE,
AND HE NEEDS ME.

173
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,172
MS. STARNDORF,
YOUR FATHER MADE HIS DECISION.

174
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,406
HE WANTS TO STAY.

175
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,041
HE MADE IT EQUALLY CLEAR
HE WANTS YOU OUT.

176
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,876
- BUT YOU CAN'T LET ME GO!
- YES, I CAN.

177
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,712
- MS. STARNDORF! MS. STARNDORF!

178
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,814
I'M SURE YOUR FATHER'S GONNA
CATCH A PLANE IN A DAY OR TWO

179
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,182
WHEN HE SEES
THAT EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.

180
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,917
I HAVE A DAUGHTER, MYSELF.

181
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,419
I'M SURE HE JUST WANTS
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

182
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,421
NOW, PLEASE...
PLEASE GET ON THE PLANE.

183
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,123
- GOOD WORK, PARKER.

184
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,359
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
AND HELP ME CALM THE OTHERS.

185
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,394
- SIR...

186
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,202
- NOW, PARKER!

187
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,237
THAT'S AN ORDER.

188
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,052
- EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN,

189
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,354
FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE
TO SIT DOWN, HOLD ON.

190
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,923
Flight 210, you're clear
for immediate takeoff.

191
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,925
Clear out of here
as quick as you can.

192
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,360
We have major storms moving in.

193
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,895
- OKAY, CLOSE IT UP.

194
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,030
- PULL IT BACK!

195
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,436
- COLONEL, I NEED TO GET OFF THIS PLANE!
- IT'S TOO LATE.

196
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,071
- N-NO, SIR, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND...
- YOU ARE TOO LATE.

197
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,339
SIR, MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER
ARE OUT THERE.

198
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,774
- THEY CAN GET ON THE NEXT PLANE.

199
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,208
NOW YOU SIT DOWN,
AND THAT'S AN ORDER.

200
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,180
- OKAY, PARKER!

201
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,782
NOW, YOU'RE COMING ON THIS PLANE

202
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,050
EITHER AS A PASSENGER
OR A CORPSE.

203
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,318
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

204
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,455
I'M GETTING OFF THIS PLANE
RIGHT NOW, COLONEL.

205
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,461
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER YOURSELF
REALLY SPECIAL, PARKER.

206
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,932
YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN WHO EVER
PULLED A GUN ON ME AND LIVED.

207
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,867
- UNH!

208
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,478
- WHAT THE HELL?s

209
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,448
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF OUR OFFERS
JUST LET UP.

210
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,218
THE SolStar-2 HAS JUST SWITCHED
FROM RED TO GREEN,

211
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,453
I NEED YOU TO CHECK IT OUT.

212
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,554
WHY?

213
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,089
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE CODES.

214
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,423
IT CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED

215
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,093
FROM ITS ORIGINAL
CONTROL CENTER IN BERLIN.

216
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,929
LOOK, EITHER SOMEBODY'S
ALIVE OUT THERE

217
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,431
OR SOME GENIUS
JUST RIPPED THE CODE.

218
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,187
- SANDWICH?

219
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,588
- THANKS.

220
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,156
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

221
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,424
I BARELY MADE IT OUT OF THERE
THREE YEARS AGO,

222
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,226
AND NOW THEY'RE
SENDING US BACK IN.

223
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,327
FOR WHAT?

224
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,230
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
FORGOT TO TURN THE LIGHTS OUT

225
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,898
AT THE NLI INSTITUTE IN BERLIN.

226
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,133
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

227
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,168
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

228
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,169
- YEP.
- DRAG.

229
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,272
I WAS IN BERLIN
FOR TWO YEARS...

230
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,907
WILD TOWN IN ITS DAY.

231
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,222
- HEY, YOU FEEL THAT?

232
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,691
- THE PLANE'S GETTING WARMER.

233
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,159
- JESUS.

234
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,228
SOMEBODY TELL THE PILOT
TO CUT THE HEAT.

235
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,634
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

236
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,303
- RIGHT.

237
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,676
CAPTAIN, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

238
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,678
WE'RE ON FIRE BACK HERE.

239
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,646
THAT DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD
NOW, DOES IT?

240
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,249
WANT TO CHECK IT OUT?

241
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,323
MADAME PRESIDENT, IT WAS
A MICROWAVE BEAM FROM SolStar-2.

242
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,358
BASICALLY,
THEY WERE FLASH-FRIED.

243
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,461
AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT SolStar-2
IS ACTIVE AND UNDER CONTROL...

244
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,729
ALBEIT HOSTILE CONTROL.

245
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,265
WE LOST 18 MEN
TO FIND THAT OUT.

246
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,166
I THOUGHT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE

247
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,734
ONLY FROM
THE COMMAND CENTER IN BERLIN.

248
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,403
THAT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DEATH ZONE.

249
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,504
AND ACCORDING TO
OUR LATEST INTELLIGENCE

250
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,272
FROM THE DEATH ZONE,
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY CONTACT THERE

251
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,273
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

252
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,509
I'D SAY WE HAVE
AN INTELLIGENCE FAILURE THEN.

253
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:47,279
COLONEL, SolStar's
MICROWAVE BEAM

254
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,248
PRESENTS A THREAT
TO ALL OUR AIRCRAFT.

255
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,716
- THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

256
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,318
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

257
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,686
THE MICROWAVE BEAM
WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED

258
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,688
TO BE TRANSMITTED
TO GROUND-RELAY STATIONS

259
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,222
AT A LOW LEVEL OF ENERGY.

260
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,390
- AND?
- AT A HIGHER LEVEL,

261
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,693
IT CAN BE DISCHARGED FROM
A SINGLE, CONCENTRATED BURST.

262
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,562
- RESULTING IN...?
- MASSIVE WIDE-SCALE DESTRUCTION.

263
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,165
SolStar-2 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EXPERIMENTAL POWER STATION

264
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,133
THAT WOULD GIVE HUMANITY
AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY

265
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,502
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY END
OUR DEPENDANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS.

266
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,237
THE MILITARY FUNDED
ITS DEVELOPMENT.

267
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,406
WE NEEDED IT TO HAVE
SOME SORT OF WEAPON CAPACITY.

268
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,275
A WEAPON?

269
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,144
EVEN YOUR BLACK OPS
HAVE BLACK OPS.

270
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,313
ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

271
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,614
- SolStar-2 WAS CONSIDERED LOST.

272
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,483
WE ASSUMED IT HAD BEEN
DAMAGED OR DESTROYED

273
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,418
WHEN THE COMET ENTERED
THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

274
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,655
WE SAW NO NEED TO PUT
A DEAD PROJECT IN THE REPORT.

275
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:34,693
WELL, SOMEBODY OUT THERE
IS USING IT AGAINST US.

276
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,729
ARE THERE ANY EXPERTS
WHO CAN HELP US?

277
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,831
GREGOR STARNDORF
DESIGNED THE SATELLITE.

278
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,367
HOWEVER, HE AND HIS
PROJECT SUPERVISOR, HINTZE,

279
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,502
REMAINED IN BERLIN
WHEN IT WAS EVACUATED.

280
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,305
BUT HIS DAUGHTER, ANNA,
WHO ALSO WORKED ON THE PROJECT,

281
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,374
DID GET OUT.

282
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,175
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

283
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,778
- QUITO, ECUADOR, SOUTH AMERICA.

284
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,781
- I WANT HER BACK.
- YES, MA'AM.

285
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,201
NO, NO.

286
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,604
SI, SENORA.

287
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,305
- YEP. YES, HELLO?

288
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,242
TODAY?
NO, OUT OF THE QUESTION.

289
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,744
I JUST...

290
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,212
IT WHAT?

291
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,616
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

292
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,284
YEAH, BYE.

293
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,208
- HEY-HEY-HEY, HEY, HEY.

294
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,242
- IT'S OKAY, OKAY?

295
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,310
- LEAVE HER ALONE.

296
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,412
THANK YOU.

297
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,215
- ANNA STARNDORF?

298
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,683
- DO I KNOW YOU?

299
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,686
YEAH, UH, TOM PARKER...
USED TO BE "CAPTAIN TOM PARKER."

300
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,521
I'M NO LONGER IN THE MILITARY.

301
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,391
I MET YOU AT THE U.S. EMBASSY
IN BERLIN WITH YOUR FATHER.

302
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,759
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

303
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,494
SORRY,
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT.

304
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,229
YEAH.

305
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,331
SEEMS WE ONLY RUN INTO
EACH OTHER WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE.

306
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,833
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF TROUBLE THE LAST THREE YEARS.

307
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,801
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT DIFFICULT.

308
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,536
- AND THIS IS YOUR FRIEND?

309
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,739
THIS... THIS IS SASQUATCH,
MY TRAVELING COMPANION.

310
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,774
- OH, REALLY?

311
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,576
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN TRAVELING?

312
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,512
NORTH... ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO GET BACK TO BERLIN.

313
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,880
- BUT THEY SAID THAT NO ONE...

314
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,682
- WELL, NO ONE HAS.

315
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,184
THERE HASN'T EVEN BEEN A RESCUE
MISSION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS.

316
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,587
I'VE BEEN TRYING ALONE.

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,789
I KNOW THAT PROBABLY
SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT...

318
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,924
NO-NO, NO-NO, NO,
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

319
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,560
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE FANTASIZED

320
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,296
ABOUT PACKING A BAG
AND HEADING OUT, YOU KNOW?

321
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,832
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN ECUADOR,

322
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,969
SO A JOURNEY TO BERLIN
IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF MY WAY.

323
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,437
- ECUADOR?
- YEAH.

324
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,639
I'M HELPING
TO FEED REFUGEES THERE.

325
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,543
SO, AFTER BERLIN,
MY SPACE RESEARCH SEEMED TO...

326
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,647
SPACE RESEARCH... THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR FATHER DEVELOPED SolStar-2.

327
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,948
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

328
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,684
SO, YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH.

329
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,319
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

330
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,588
IS THERE SOMEPLACE
THAT WE CAN SPEAK IN PRIVATE?

331
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,258
- YEAH, COME WITH ME.

332
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,503
- MS. STARNDORF,

333
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,906
NORMALLY, WHEN YOU'RE CALLED
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT,

334
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,276
THE SUMMONS IS FOR YOU ALONE...
NOT YOU AND A GUEST.

335
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,744
- MY APOLOGIES.

336
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,646
THIS IS TOM PARKER.

337
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,581
HE USED TO WORK AT
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN.

338
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,485
- AND HE'S HERE BECAUSE...?

339
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,589
TWO DAYS AGO, UP NORTH, ONE
OF YOUR MILITARY JETS CRASHED.

340
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,924
I SAW IT GO DOWN.

341
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,592
- A TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

342
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,395
- IT WAS NO ACCIDENT, MA'AM.

343
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,630
YOU CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION
BY YOURSELF?

344
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,632
- NO, MA'AM.

345
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:05,470
I RECOVERED THE BLACK BOX.

346
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,876
THIS DAMAGE OCCURRED
BEFORE THE PLANE BLEW UP.

347
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,645
THE ONLY WEAPON THAT I KNOW THAT
COULD CAUSE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE

348
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,682
IS A MICROWAVE-BEAM
WEAPON... SolStar-2.

349
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,019
WHY DON'T I HAVE
PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON MY STAFF?

350
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,921
I'D LIKE TO BE INCLUDED
ON THE EXPEDITION, MA'AM.

351
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,690
- WHAT EXPEDITION?

352
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,558
THE ONE THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEND
TO BERLIN TO INVESTIGATE.

353
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,527
- THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

354
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,963
COLONEL WATERS, I'M
THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON...

355
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,998
LOOK, WHY DON'T I JUST HAVE YOU ARRESTED
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN'T GO?

356
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,467
WHY DON'T YOU STICK A GUN IN
MY FACE LIKE YOU DID LAST TIME?

357
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,635
- THAT CAN BE ARRANGED, PARKER.

358
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,605
EASE UP ON THE TESTOSTERONE,
GENTLEMEN.

359
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,610
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
BACK TO BERLIN, MR. PARKER?

360
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,878
- PERSONAL REASONS, MA'AM.

361
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,447
- HE'S RIGHT.

362
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,616
HE HAS ALREADY TRIED
TO GET THERE EIGHT TIMES.

363
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,918
HIS EXPERIENCE
COULD PROVE INVALUABLE.

364
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,455
CONSIDER YOURSELF DRAFTED,
MR. PARKER,

365
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,956
BY THE N.U.N.S. GOVERNMENT.

366
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,492
IF YOU FORMALLY WORKED
FOR THE EMBASSY,

367
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,961
I DON'T HAVE TO
REMIND YOU ABOUT SECURITY?

368
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,096
- NO, MA'AM.

369
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,098
- THANK YOU, MR. PARKER.

370
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,568
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
YOU KNOW COLONEL WATERS,

371
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,603
BUT HE'LL BE
HEADING THIS MISSION.

372
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,041
YOU'LL BE TAKING YOUR ORDERS
FROM HIM, IS THAT CLEAR?

373
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,442
- YES, MA'AM.

374
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,048
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE BETTER
BEHAVED THAN YOUR DOG,

375
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,583
MR. PARKER.

376
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,552
YES, MA'AM.

377
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,660
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT
I DON'T WANT YOU ON THIS TRIP,

378
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,963
BUT I HAVE MY ORDERS
JUST LIKE LAST TIME.

379
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,364
- AIN'T MUCH.

380
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,732
- WHAT?

381
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,968
A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS,
A COUPLE TRUCKS...

382
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,604
I'D EXPECT A BIGGER CONVOY
FOR WHAT'S AT STAKE.

383
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,839
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

384
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,975
THE UNITED STATES
HAVE US BY THE BALLS.

385
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,977
WE NEED THEIR ALL
MORE THAN EVER NOW.

386
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,447
THIS IS SARAH HENLEY.
SHE'S EX-S.A.S. WITH THE BRITS.

387
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,015
SHE'S BEEN SELECTED
AS MY SECOND IN COMMAND,

388
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,485
AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL
FOLLOW HER INSTRUCTIONS

389
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,487
EXACTLY THE SAME
AS YOU WOULD FOLLOW MINE.

390
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,689
YOU UNDERSTAND?

391
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,490
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
I'D FOLLOW YOURS.

392
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,492
- HM.
- SURE. SURE.

393
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,027
- IT'S NOT ALL CHEER.

394
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,663
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

395
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,765
- I BET YOU CAN.

396
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,001
- CATCH YOU LATER.

397
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,066
IT MAKES YOU WONDER,
DOESN'T IT?

398
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,473
WE ONLY GET THAT
ON NATIONAL HOLIDAYS

399
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,475
AND BEFORE A DANGEROUS MISSION.

400
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,789
DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU WANT
TO TAKE EVERYTHING YOU CAN GET

401
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,657
BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

402
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:16,728
I GUESS THAT WOULD DEPEND ON
WHAT I COULD GET.

403
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,497
THAT WAS GOOD.

404
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,851
- LADIES, GENTLEMEN... PRESIDENT.

405
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,831
MADAME PRESIDENT,
WE'RE SET TO GO.

406
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,801
4 MILLION, WATERS...
REMEMBER THAT NUMBER.

407
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,837
- EXCUSE ME?

408
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,906
Space research lab's registered
a shift in SolStar's position.

409
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,942
According to their calculations,

410
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,779
It's targeting pretty much
the ground we're standing on.

411
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,747
If their estimates are right,

412
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,950
it'll be ready to fire
in 48 hours.

413
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:50,822
IF IT DOES,
FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE COULD DIE.

414
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,925
GOD SPEED TO YOU ALL.

415
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,896
OKAY, PEOPLE, WE HAVE
A DEADLINE... 48 HOURS.

416
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,064
LET'S MOVE.

417
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:17,983
EVERYBODY IN THE TRUCKS.

418
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,317
PREPARE TO DROP.

419
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,025
- THANKS FOR TH...

420
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,295
WHOA.

421
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,264
- TOM?

422
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,799
TOM, IT'S TIME TO...

423
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,669
OH. WE'RE FLYING SO LOW.

424
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,971
- ANY LOWER, WE'D BE DRIVING.

425
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,007
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ONCE LIVED HERE.

426
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,010
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS.

427
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,245
IF THINGS STAY THE SAME
FOR A WHILE,

428
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,216
LIFE TRICKS US INTO BELIEVING
THAT THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.

429
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,752
- TOM, CAN I TRUST YOU?

430
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,253
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

431
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,823
YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR A PERSONAL REASON, SO AM I.

432
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,392
THEY THINK THAT MY DAD IS ALIVE

433
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,061
AND HE'S IN CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE.

434
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,197
- WELL, WHAT IF HE IS?

435
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,301
- MY FATHER DIED IN BERLIN.

436
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:13,772
WELL, WHAT IF, FOR
WHATEVER REASON, HE DIDN'T DIE

437
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,006
AND HE IS IN CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE?

438
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,977
- I DON'T KNOW.

439
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,149
- THEN I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES.

440
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,017
- WHEN HE WAS LITTLE,

441
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,253
HIS PARENTS STAYED IN BERLIN
DURING WORLD WAR II.

442
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,022
IT WAS ONCE SUCH A VIBRANT,
EXCITING CITY,

443
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,223
BUT THE WAR DESTROYED IT.

444
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,259
WHEN IT WAS OVER,
THEY STAYED, REBUILT,

445
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,028
AND TURNED THE PILE OF RUBBLE
INTO A CITY AGAIN,

446
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,930
EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE.

447
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,000
HE ALWAYS SAID,
"BERLIN IS LIKE A WIFE.

448
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,403
YOU STICK WITH HER
IN GOOD TIMES AND IN BAD."

449
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,074
SO, HE AND HIS ASSISTANTS
STAYED BEHIND.

450
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,842
- BRAVE GUYS?

451
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,878
NOT BRAVE... STUPID.

452
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,114
THEY SAY BRAVERY AND STUPIDITY
ARE CLOSE FRIENDS.

453
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:01,086
ONLY THE RESULT
SEPARATES THE TWO.

454
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,922
AND NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY I KNOW
MY FATHER'S INNOCENT.

455
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,957
HE'S SEEN TOO MUCH
DESTRUCTION IN HIS LIFE

456
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,392
TO CAUSE ANY, HIMSELF.

457
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,894
HEY, LOOK.

458
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,104
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO PARIS?

459
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,939
- MY HONEYMOON.

460
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,342
- SEE YOU ON THE GROUND.

461
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,100
TRUCK TWO, DO YOU READ ME?

462
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,168
- This is truck two.

463
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,936
We're good.

464
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,041
OKAY, SYSTEM CHECKED,
EVERYTHING IN THE GREEN.

465
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,081
WHEN THE SATELLITE
STARTS TURNING, THEN WE DROP.

466
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,916
YOU WANT TO WAIT
UNTIL SolStar-2 IS READY

467
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,117
TO FIRE ON US?
- THE PLANE'S EXPENDABLE.

468
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,152
- BUT WE ARE NOT EXPENDABLE.

469
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,921
IT'S A NECESSARY RISK
IF WE'RE GONNA CONVINCE

470
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,156
WHOEVER'S IN CONTROL
OF THAT SATELLITE

471
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,490
THAT THEY'VE DESTROYED US.

472
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,164
- YOU DON'T LIKE WATERS.

473
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,165
- DO I HAVE TO?

474
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,332
- WHAT ABOUT THE STARNDORF GIRL?

475
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,168
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

476
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,837
- YOU SEEM TO KNOW HER.

477
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,005
- FROM ANOTHER LIFE, YEAH.

478
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,907
PEOPLE ALWAYS USE THAT
EXPRESSION, "FROM ANOTHER LIFE,"

479
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,075
WHEN REFERRING TO
BEFORE THE IMPACT.

480
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,176
I THINK IT'S BULLOCKS.

481
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,911
IT'S THE SAME LIFE.

482
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,345
I WAS A SOLDIER BEFORE...
I'M A SOLDIER NOW.

483
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,980
A COMET CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

484
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,283
- I GUESS NOT.

485
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,853
- THE SATELLITE IS TURNING.
- HOW LONG?

486
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,321
-20 SECONDS.

487
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:53,031
- OKAY, EVERYONE, STRAP IN.

488
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,066
IT'S GOT A LOCK ON US.
WE NEED TO DROP.

489
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,334
- NOT YET.
- IT'S POWERING UP.

490
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,971
EVERY SECOND WE SPEND UP HERE
IS AN HOUR LESS ON THE GROUND.

491
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:00,939
ON MY MARK...

492
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,042
MICROWAVE BEAM... WE'RE HIT.

493
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,181
COLONEL WATERS, WE NEED TO GET
OUT OF THIS PLANE RIGHT NOW.

494
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,084
THE LAST PLANE
TOOK 40 SECONDS BEFORE IT BLEW.

495
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,052
- THIS IS INSANE.

496
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,020
- NO, NO, NO. IT'S A RISK.

497
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,056
SOMETIMES, IN ORDER
TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS,

498
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,959
WE HAVE TO TAKE RISKS THAT OTHER
PEOPLE MIGHT SEE AS INSANE.

499
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:21,960
DO YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT?

500
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,162
- MY FATHER.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

501
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,901
INITIATE DROP.

502
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,356
SHOOT DEPLOYMENT
IN FIVE SECONDS.

503
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,960
FOUR...

504
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,029
THREE...TWO...

505
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,063
ONE.

506
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,205
SHOOT DEPLOYED.

507
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,976
OKAY, EVERYONE, HOLD TIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH LANDING.

508
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,244
- GREAT.

509
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,114
WELL, CERTAINLY BEATS TRYING
TO GET TO BERLIN ON SNOWSHOES.

510
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,148
- DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU TRY IT.

511
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,650
- HM, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE.

512
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,251
- TRIED EIGHT TIMES.

513
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,155
I GET EVERYTHING I WANT
THE FIRST TIME I TRY.

514
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,057
I WOULD NEVER
TRY ANYTHING EIGHT TIMES.

515
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,325
WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING?

516
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,327
A PROMISE.
WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING?

517
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,164
MY ORDERS...
THAT'S KIND OF A PROMISE, TOO.

518
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,265
HERE WE GO.

519
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,280
- IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

520
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,049
- THAT WASN'T SO BAD.

521
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,617
- EXACTLY WHERE ARE WE?

522
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,688
NEAR THE FORMER
FRENCH-BELGIUM BORDER.

523
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,524
OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE'S
NEGATIVE... 52T CELSIUS.

524
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,259
- OKAY, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

525
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,094
TRUCK TWO, WE TAKE THE LEAD.

526
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,562
- THIS IS TRUCK TWO.

527
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,431
ROGER THAT, TRUCK ONE.

528
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,718
AH, THIS DAMN TWILIGHT.
I CAN'T SEE A THING.

529
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,686
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
DOES IT GET ANY BETTER?

530
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,622
- NOPE.

531
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,157
GONNA BE DIFFICULT TO DO
THE WEATHER FORECAST OUT HERE.

532
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:37,161
YEAH, EVERY DAY'S
CLOUDY AND COLD... THAT'S IT.

533
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,278
- YOU SEE?

534
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,980
THE WEATHER'S STABLE,
BUT THE GROUND ISN'T.

535
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,449
THAT COMET CAUSED SOME SORT
OF PROBLEM WITH THE MAGMA FLOW.

536
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,085
PEOPLE THINK THAT EUROPE'S
GONNA BREAK APART.

537
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,186
AS LONG AS IT
HOLDS UP LONG ENOUGH

538
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,223
FOR US TO GET OUR ASSES
OUT OF HERE, I DON'T CARE.

539
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,598
WHAT WAS THAT?
- ICE GEYSER.

540
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,700
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
UNDERNEATH THE ICE.

541
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,168
- YEAH, YOU'RE TELLING ME.

542
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,470
WHY DON'T YOU AND PARKER
GET SOME REST.

543
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,139
Let Scott drive.

544
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,474
- YOU WANT TO GET SOME REST?

545
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,546
SORRY, SOMEBODY DOESN'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

546
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,357
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU MEAN "DETOUR"?

547
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,825
According to
David Crockett, here,

548
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,060
we've got to be very careful
crossing the river.

549
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,328
- THE GROUND'S FROZEN SOLID.

550
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,097
IT'LL EASILY TAKE
THE WEIGHT OF TWO TRUCKS.

551
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,599
THE GROUND OVER THE RIVER
IS EXTREMELY JAGGED

552
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,301
AND COMPLETELY UNSTABLE.

553
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,337
The bridges are intact.
I say we use one of those.

554
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,607
FOR GOD'S SAKE, PARKER,
YOU KNOW TIME'S OF THE ESSENCE.

555
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,682
OKAY. OKAY.

556
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,317
WHICH ONE'S THE NEAREST?

557
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,752
WEILER, COLOGNE

558
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,154
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BRIDGES
IN THIS CITY.

559
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,188
- PICK ONE.

560
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,224
- TARGET THE COLOGNE CATHEDRAL.

561
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,192
The Deutzer Bridge
should be right next to it.

562
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,361
WE HAVE THE CATHEDRAL
ON OUR SCANNERS.

563
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,530
IT'S ONLY FEW MILES
OUT OF OUR WAY.

564
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,132
COLOGNE...

565
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,167
I WENT THERE WHEN I WAS A KID...
GREAT CARNIVAL.

566
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,103
YEAH, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE
MISSED THAT CARNIVAL OF YOURS.

567
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,120
Okay.

568
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,622
LET'S DO THIS.

569
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,524
THE SOONER I GET OVER THERE,
THE HAPPIER I'M GONNA BE.

570
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,858
TRUCK TWO, YOU TAKE THE LEAD.

571
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,226
- ROGER THAT, COLONEL.

572
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,828
TAKE THIS SLOW AND CAREFUL.

573
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,798
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE GONNA
COME UP AGAINST, ALL RIGHT?

574
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,680
IT LOOKS LIKE
LEVEL ICE UP AHEAD.

575
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:45,550
PICK UP THE SPEED, PARKER.

576
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,385
- NO-NO, NO-NO, NO-NO.

577
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,158
- Come on, Parker! Faster!

578
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,827
- I WOULDN'T ADVISE THAT, SIR.

579
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,397
WELL, YOUR ADVICE HAS BEEN
NOTED AND IS DULY BEING IGNORED.

580
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,466
GIVE ME
SOME MORE SPEED, MALONEY.

581
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,539
THAT IDIOT'S GONNA
GET US KILLED.

582
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,708
OKAY, GIVE HIM SOME SPACE.

583
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,725
SHIT.

584
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,894
COLONEL, ARE YOU OKAY?
IS EVERYBODY OKAY IN THERE?

585
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,594
- BRACE YOURSELVES!

586
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,497
WHEN THIS THING GOES,
IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE!

587
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,533
PARKER!

588
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,669
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET YOURSELF KILLED?!

589
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,671
NO, SIR, JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

590
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,539
HERE CATCH THE ROPE.

591
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,458
- LADIES FIRST, MS. STARNDORF.

592
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,359
- I CAN'T. I FALL.

593
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,561
I GOT HER, COLONEL.
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

594
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,762
- OKAY.

595
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,037
- BETTER HOLD ONTO ME.

596
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,673
I GOT YOU,
I GOT YOU.

597
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,582
HOLD ONTO ME. HOLD ONTO ME!

598
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,686
JUST SLOWING YOU DOWN.

599
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,854
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

600
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,055
IT'S OKAY. I GOT YOU.

601
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,890
SEE? TOLD YOU. ALL RIGHT.

602
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,661
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT
WE'RE ALL ABOUT TO BE KILLED!

603
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,597
SO GIVE HER A HAND, HENLEY!
HELP ME OUT!

604
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,733
OKAY, ANNA, WE... HERE WE GO.

605
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,684
- GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

606
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,464
- WHERE IS PARKER?

607
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,999
- I DIDN'T SEE HIM GET OFF.

608
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,641
AAAAH!

609
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,688
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

610
00:38:58,569 --> 00:38:59,837
- BLOODY HELL, WHAT NOW?
- WHAT IS IT?

611
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,573
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE BROKE
THE FRONT AXLE ON THE LAST RUN.

612
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,641
- DO WE NEED TO FIX IT?
- YEAH, WE DO.

613
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,643
UNLESS WE WANT TO TRAVEL
TO BERLIN ON A TURBO SLED.

614
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,678
IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE
ABOUT AN HOUR.

615
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,847
TOBIN, SCOTT, CAN YOU GET ON IT?
- COME ON, GUYS. GET A MOVE ON.

616
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,784
PARKER, THAT WAS A CRAZY STUNT
YOU PULLED BACK THERE.

617
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,885
THANKS.

618
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,621
- YEAH, SURE.

619
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,725
UH, I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE
AND GET SOME FRESH AIR.

620
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,660
- CAN I COME WITH YOU?

621
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,028
- YEAH, SURE.

622
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,737
- I WANTED TO THANK YOU, TOO.

623
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,773
NO, I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE THE COMPANY.

624
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,808
- NO...FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

625
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,577
THAT WAS VERY BRAVE.

626
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,746
- BRAVE OR STUPID?

627
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,814
I GUESS I'M NOT
GOOD UNDER STRESS.

628
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,950
WELL, YOU GET BETTER
WITH PRACTICE.

629
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,718
SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS TRIP...

630
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,787
WE'RE GONNA GET
PLENTY OF PRACTICE.

631
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,756
WHAT'S THAT?

632
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,005
IT'S PRETTY CLEVER...
DOESN'T NEED ANY BATTERIES,

633
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:12,543
WON'T EVER FREEZE, KEEPS MAKING
NOISE NIGHT AND DAY.

634
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,813
DO YOU THINK THERE IS
SOMEONE IN THERE?

635
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:20,551
NO, NO, BUT MAYBE THERE'S
SOME CLUES AS TO WHEN THEY LEFT.

636
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,886
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

637
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,053
THESE PEOPLE
TRIED TO FIGHT THE COLD.

638
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,619
- THEY DIDN'T LEAVE.

639
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,999
HOPEFULLY, THEY DIDN'T
SUFFER TOO MUCH.

640
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,970
I HEAR IT DOESN'T EVEN HURT.

641
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:50,708
DO YOU THINK THEY...
YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER...

642
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,943
ARE STILL WAITING FOR YOU?

643
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,780
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
THAT THEY ARE.

644
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,789
WE BETTER GET GOING.

645
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,100
- HOW'S IT LOOK?

646
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,670
THE CITY IS BURIED
UNDER 20 METERS OF ICE AND SNOW.

647
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:53,771
- ANY SIGN OF LIFE?

648
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,005
- NONE SO FAR.

649
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,740
I'LL PLOT A COURSE
FOR THE INSTITUTE.

650
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,842
NO. NO, DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER,

651
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,211
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO ARE WILLING TO DO US HARM.

652
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,680
WE'LL RECON FROM HERE.

653
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,248
- I CAN CHECK IT OUT ON THE SLED.

654
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,750
- YOU WOULDN'T COME BACK.
- AND WHY IS THAT?

655
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,285
BECAUSE ALL YOU WANTED
WAS TO GET TO BERLIN.

656
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,154
HOW CAN I TRUST YOU
TO COME BACK?

657
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,756
YOU KNOW, THE SLED DOES
ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEATS.

658
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,824
I COULD GO WITH HIM.

659
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,225
I MEAN, HE DOES KNOW THE CITY.

660
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,895
- BE MY GUEST.

661
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,896
- FINE.

662
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,732
- OKAY, SECURE THE PERIMETER.

663
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,334
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

664
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,735
- I WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

665
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,402
IT'S MY HOME TOWN, REMEMBER?

666
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,537
- UH, NO, NO, NO.

667
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,305
IT'S A WAR ZONE NOW,
AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE YOU.

668
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,841
YOUR JOB STARTS
ONCE WE SECURE THE INSTITUTE.

669
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,343
HEY, HEY,
TAKE IT EASY, COLONEL.

670
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,812
- DON'T TELL ME TO TAKE IT EASY!

671
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,148
NOTHING'S GONNA JEOPARDIZE
THIS MISSION, YOU UNDERSTAND?

672
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,018
SAS, SAS.

673
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,990
STAY WITH THE NICE LADY.

674
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,426
KEEP HER COMPANY
TILL I GET BACK.

675
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,664
OH, DON'T WORRY.
HE DOESN'T BITE...USUALLY.

676
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,894
DO YOU MIND PUTTING
THE GUN AWAY, PLEASE?

677
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,463
LET'S JUST CALL IT
MY INSURANCE POLICY.

678
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,332
- OKAY.

679
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,258
- WHAT, YOU LIVED HERE FOR YEARS?

680
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,194
YEAH, WELL, I DID MOST
OF MY DRIVING AROUND

681
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,430
AND WALKING AROUND
ON STREET LEVEL.

682
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,168
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT HILL.

683
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,003
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

684
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,488
- DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?

685
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,256
- HEY, I JUST SAVED OUR LIVES.

686
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,225
LEAST YOU COULD DO IS BE POLITE.

687
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,395
- OH, MY GOD.

688
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,120
ARE THOSE LIGHTS OVER THERE?

689
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,187
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

690
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,156
THEY USE A LOT OF MIRRORS INSIDE

691
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,858
SO THAT THE SUN
WAS SHINING ON PARLIAMENT.

692
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,327
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, PROFESSOR...
FASCINATING HISTORY LESSON.

693
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,528
I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING.

694
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,829
IT'S GONNA GET DARK SOON.

695
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,570
- I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.

696
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,109
GET INSIDE!

697
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,577
HENLEY, LET'S GO!

698
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,867
- JESUS. THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK.

699
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,176
THEY'RE SITTING DUCKS
RIGHT THERE.

700
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,177
WHY DON'T THEY MOVE?

701
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,449
OH, MY GOD.

702
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,592
- Parker, get out of there!

703
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,295
- COLONEL WATERS, YOU'RE ALIVE?

704
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,097
We're about 200 meters ahead
behind the building.

705
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,233
They've seen us.
Get out of the sled!

706
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,221
- WHAT HAPPENED?!

707
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,656
WE CAME OUT, THEY SAW US,
SO WE EVAC-ED THE TRUCK.

708
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,393
- ANY CASUALTIES?

709
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,429
RICH DIDN'T MAKE IT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

710
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,431
SAME AS YOU...
WE CAME UNDER FIRE.

711
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,167
WELL, THIS EXPEDITION'S TURNED
INTO A MILITARY CONFLICT.

712
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,669
WE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE! LET'S GO!

713
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,671
- OKAY, GO-O-O-O!

714
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,567
- TOM, LOOK!
- WHAT IS IT?

715
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,336
- I DON'T KNOW... RIGHT THERE.

716
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,138
- IT'S A TUNNEL!
- WELL, LET'S GO DIG THAT.

717
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,673
ELLISON, TAKE POINT!

718
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,242
- SAS, COME HERE, BOY.

719
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,243
COME HERE.

720
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,206
- IT'S A LOT WARMER DOWN HERE.

721
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,508
WHAT'S THAT?

722
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,549
- IT'S STILL WARM.

723
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,485
WHAT IS IT, SAS?
WHAT IS IT, BOY, HUH?

724
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,357
GO!

725
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,176
MY GOD, IT'S A LITTLE GIRL.

726
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,510
- THIS LITTLE, POOR THING.

727
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,312
SHE'S SCARED.

728
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,449
HEY. HEY, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

729
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,217
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

730
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,253
LOOK, EVEN MY DOG, SASQUATCH,
LIKES YOU, SEE?

731
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,257
LOOKS LIKE YOU
MAKE FRIENDS FAST.

732
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,394
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

733
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,462
- SAS, GO.

734
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,597
- DON'T YOU HAVE A NAME?

735
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,333
- MAYBE SHE CAN'T SPEAK.

736
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,601
CAN WE SPEED UP
WITH YOUR TOUCHY-FEELY STUFF.

737
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,536
TAKING THE INSTITUTE'S
OUR PRIORITY,

738
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,271
AND, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

739
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,573
WE JUST LOST OUR RIDE HOME.

740
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,408
- LET'S NOT RUSH INTO THINGS.

741
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,510
ANYBODY WHO SURVIVED HERE
FOR THREE YEARS

742
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,579
KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THE CITY THAN WE DO

743
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,347
AND PROBABLY
ABOUT OUR ATTACKERS.

744
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,416
AND WHAT IF THEY ARE
THE ATTACKERS?

745
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,551
SIR, I THINK OUR PRIORITY'S A...

746
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,421
I'M PERFECTLY WELL AWARE
OF OUR PRIORITIES, HENLEY...

747
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,423
AND ALSO OF
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

748
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,359
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE?

749
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,363
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

750
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,665
WE WON'T HURT YOU,
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP.

751
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,568
HENLEY, GIVE ME ONE
OF YOUR ENERGY BARS.

752
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,403
WHAT AM I?
THE SALVATION ARMY?

753
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,506
- JUST DO IT.

754
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,483
- YOU HUNGRY?

755
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,552
HERE.

756
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,256
YEAH.

757
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,492
LISTEN, WE REALLY NEED
TO SPEAK TO THE OTHER PEOPLE.

758
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,494
CAN YOU TAKE US TO THEM?

759
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,598
OKAY, GREAT.

760
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:21,031
ALL THIS TIME,
WE THOUGHT NOBODY SURVIVED.

761
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,566
- IT'S AMAZING.

762
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,581
- WHERE DO YOU FIGURE WE ARE?

763
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:42,452
UNLESS I'M COMPLETELY OFF, THIS
IS THE U2-LINE SERVICE STATION.

764
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,522
- EXCUSE US.

765
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,591
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
STRANGERS HERE SINCE...

766
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,061
WELL, IT'S BEEN YEARS.

767
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,664
WE WERE SENT HERE
BY THE GOVERNMENT

768
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,399
OF THE PROVISIONAL
NORTHERN STATES.

769
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,967
- FOR US?
- NO.

770
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,335
- EXCUSE ME.

771
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,871
HAVE YOU...

772
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:39,476
SEEN...THESE...PEOPLE?

773
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,411
NO?

774
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,582
- NO, WE'RE HERE ON A MISSION.

775
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,486
WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE ARE
STILL PEOPLE HERE.

776
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,954
DID YOU TRY TO LEAVE?

777
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,089
- THINGS GOT VERY BAD VERY FAST.

778
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,859
NO PLACES WERE LEFT...
THE STREETS WERE BLOCKED.

779
00:54:55,892 --> 00:55:00,096
THE GROUND FROZE, SO WE COULDN'T
EVEN BURY THE DEAD.

780
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,999
EVENTUALLY, A LOT OF US
WENT UNDERGROUND.

781
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,134
- WHO'S YOUR LEADER?

782
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,702
- LEADER?

783
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,005
WELL, SOMEONE MUST BE
ORGANIZING ALL THIS.

784
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,107
WELL, HE'S NOT
SO MUCH OF A LEADER,

785
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,077
BUT THE DOCTOR HAS HELPED US
TO GET THINGS ORGANIZED.

786
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,412
- CAN WE TALK TO HIM?

787
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,047
- HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

788
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,615
HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF.

789
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,618
HE'S NOT VERY WELL
ON HIS FEET THESE DAYS.

790
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,787
HE USUALLY IS IN THE REICHTAG.

791
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,722
- AND HOW DO WE GET THERE?

792
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:30,026
OH, GO DOWN THE OTHER TUNNEL
ABOUT 500 METERS.

793
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,896
YOU'LL SEE A BREAK...
YOU SEE, WE BROKE THROUGH A WALL

794
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,464
TO GET A DIRECT ACCESS TO IT.

795
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,832
- THANK YOU.

796
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,541
- TOM?

797
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,910
TOM, ARE YOU COMING?

798
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,185
IS THIS LITTLE GIRL
PART OF YOUR GROUP?

799
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,988
HER PARENTS WERE KILLED
IN AN ACCIDENT A FEW YEARS BACK.

800
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,992
WE OFFERED HER A PLACE TO LIVE,
BUT SHE LIKES TO COME AND GO.

801
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,854
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- SOMETHING DOESN'T ADD UP.

802
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,822
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN THINGS DON'T ADD UP.

803
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,691
HEY, LOOK, I THINK
WE CAN SAFELY SAY

804
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,627
THAT THESE PEOPLE
DIDN'T ATTACK US.

805
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,130
HAD ANYONE SEEN YOUR FAMILY?
- NO.

806
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,176
- TOBIN, SECURE THE POSITION.

807
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,687
SOMEBODY'S GOT
A REAL GREEN THUMB.

808
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,689
- YEAH, I GUESS I DID SEE LIGHTS.

809
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,192
LET'S SPREAD OUT
AND FIND THIS DOCTOR.

810
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,160
ELLISON, SECURE THIS POSITION.

811
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,098
- SAS, WAIT.

812
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:37,680
FINSCHEN, WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO, MY LITTLE GIRL?

813
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,017
- DADDY?

814
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,019
- ANNA.

815
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,188
- DADDY.

816
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,858
- DADDY.
- ANNA.

817
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,133
- DADDY?

818
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:05,074
DADDY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU?

819
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,244
WHEN I DECIDED TO STAY, I KNEW
THERE'D BE A PRICE TO PAY.

820
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,848
I COULDN'T LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME.

821
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,183
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

822
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:19,122
OH, DADDY, I FORGAVE YOU
A LONG TIME AGO.

823
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,125
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS RIGHT.

824
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:26,262
- SO, I GUESS YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

825
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,064
- OH, REALLY?

826
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:32,235
THAT'S...WHAT PEOPLE CALL ME
BECAUSE I HELP THEM TO GET BY.

827
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,237
- DAD, THIS IS TOM PARKER.

828
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,371
REMEMBER HIM?

829
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,007
HE WAS THE HEAD OF SECURITY

830
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,643
AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY
IN BERLIN...

831
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,045
THE NIGHT WE DISCOVERED

832
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,713
BAY-LEDER 7 HAD
CHANGED COURSE...

833
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,016
- I'VE FORGOTTEN SO MANY THINGS.

834
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:52,155
WELL, MR. PARKER, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU COULDN'T STAY AWAY, EITHER.

835
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,256
- YES, SIR.

836
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,360
- CUCURBITA LAGENARIA.

837
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:00,229
THE ORDINARY CUCUMBER.

838
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,899
- DAD, WHO BUILT THIS?

839
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,734
- WE ALL PULLED TOGETHER...

840
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,170
PLENTY OF TIME,
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

841
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,106
- SO, YOU GROW ALL THE FOOD HERE?

842
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,908
- ONLY A LITTLE.

843
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:16,212
THREE YEARS AGO, STARVATION WAS
AS MUCH AS A KILLER AS THE COLD.

844
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,981
THE COLD FINALLY WON.

845
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,049
SO MANY DIED
THAT THOSE WHO SURVIVED

846
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,318
COULD EASILY LIVE
FROM THE FOOD THEY FOUND

847
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,721
FROZEN IN THE STORE
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

848
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,457
- SO, THEN WHY BUILD ALL THIS?

849
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,060
PEOPLE SHOULD
ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE

850
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:35,164
WHERE THEY CAN FEEL
THE LIGHT, MR. PARKER.

851
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:39,168
HE WILL BE TRYING TO SELL US
A TIMESHARE NEXT.

852
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:41,104
- WHO IS THIS?

853
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,006
WE CAME HERE WITH COLONEL
WATERS AND A FEW SOLDIERS.

854
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,041
WHY HAVE YOU
BROUGHT IN SOLDIERS?

855
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,011
- IT'S SECURITY MEASURE, MR. STARNDORF.
- SECURITY MEASURE?

856
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,713
THE ONLY PEOPLE STILL CARRYING
GUNS ARE THE DISTRIBUTORS...

857
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,081
MY SECURITY FORCE.

858
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,117
AND WHY EXACTLY DO YOU NEED
A SECURITY FORCE?

859
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,285
AFTER THE STORMS,
PEOPLE CAME IN FROM THE NORTH.

860
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,354
WHEN THEY THREATENED
OUR EXISTENCE, WE...

861
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:03,026
SO DISTRIBUTORS WERE FORMED
TO PROTECT YOU FROM LOOTERS.

862
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,028
- WE HELPED AS MANY AS WE COULD.

863
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,996
AND WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THEY DOING NOW?

864
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,365
AS THE WORD IMPLIES,
THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING

865
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:12,402
FOOD AND MATERIALS IN THE REGION
AND SETTLE CONFLICTS.

866
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,410
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE STILL ALIVE IN BERLIN?

867
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,380
- LET ME GUESS... 603?

868
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,082
WE HAVE 11 BABIES.

869
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:29,085
WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL OF
N.L.O.S.I. AT THIS TIME?

870
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,154
- OH, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

871
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,789
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DAD?

872
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,290
- THE REACTIVATION OF SolStar-2.

873
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,159
THE USE OF SolStar-2 AS
A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

874
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,094
IT HAS BEEN DEEMED
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.

875
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,228
- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
- CONSIDER YOURSELF UNDER ARREST

876
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:42,165
AND SURRENDER CONTROL OF
THE SATELLITE TO US IMMEDIATELY.

877
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,134
WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL
OF SolStar-2 RIGHT NOW?

878
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,769
- AFTER I DESIGNED THE PLAN,

879
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,172
WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BEST
THAT HINTZE SHOULD RUN IT.

880
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,074
- KLAUS HINTZE?

881
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,109
OF COURSE. CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

882
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,044
- WHAT EXACTLY WAS YOUR PLAN?

883
01:01:55,078 --> 01:02:00,049
MY PLAN WAS... MY PLAN IS
TO WIDEN THE FOCUS OF THE BEAM

884
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,518
TO TARGET AN AREA
NEARLY 1,000 KILOMETERS WIDE.

885
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,420
THE BEAM WOULD HAVE
HARDLY ANY EFFECT.

886
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,155
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT HINTZE THOUGHT,

887
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,124
BUT I COULD PROVE TO HIM,

888
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,525
SINCE THE WEATHER HAD
VIRTUALLY COME TO A STANDSTILL,

889
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,060
IT WOULD ACCUMULATE THE EFFECTS.

890
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,562
YEAH, BY BOMBARDING
THE COLD LAYER

891
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,297
WITH A LOW-INTENSITY
MICROWAVE BEAM,

892
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,998
YOU COULD CREATE
AN ARTIFICIAL WARM FRONT.

893
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:17,200
- RESULTING IN WHAT?

894
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,236
- CLIMATE KICK START.

895
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,077
AT THIS MOMENT,
SolStar-2 IS POWERED UP

896
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,379
AND AIMED AT CITIES
IN NORTHERN AFRICA.

897
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,482
TAKE ME TO
THE INSTITUTE RIGHT NOW.

898
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:41,090
- DOCTOR, NOT IN YOUR CONDITION.

899
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:44,193
ANY HAND TOUCHES METAL,
YOU'RE DEAD.

900
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,495
DOWN.

901
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,270
- SO, YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME.

902
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,205
- DOCTOR, BE FAIR.

903
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,408
HAVEN'T WE BEEN HELPING
ALL THE TIME?

904
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:04,046
TAKING MY TECHNOLOGY AND USING
IT FOR... COMMIT A MASS MURDER.

905
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,149
- IT'S A WAR ABOUT SURVIVAL,

906
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,418
AND WE JUST GOT OURSELVES
A WEAPON THAT CAN WIN IT.

907
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,320
- SO, WHAT?

908
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,489
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?

909
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,192
- THE QUESTION IS, DOCTOR,

910
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:20,096
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO?

911
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,102
- NO, I DO NOT.

912
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,024
- IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

913
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,259
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.
- I'M GOOD.

914
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,999
- ANNA?

915
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,169
ANNA.

916
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,572
PLEASE,
DADDY, DON'T...

917
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,242
- DON'T CRY, MY LOVE.

918
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,347
I'VE GOT MORE
THAN I EVER HOPED FOR.

919
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,315
I GOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

920
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,185
YES, I'M... I'M HERE.

921
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:53,089
MR. STARNDORF, WE NEED THE
MASTER CODES AT THE INSTITUTE...

922
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:55,191
- LEAVE US ALONE!

923
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:04,033
REMEMBER...
IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAID.

924
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,202
- REMEMBER WHAT?

925
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:10,239
- YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME TO REMEMBER.

926
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,209
- REMEMBER WHAT, DADDY?

927
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:17,413
NO.

928
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,251
SIR, CAN I SUGGEST
THAT WE PUSH ON TO THE INSTITUTE

929
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,121
AND TAKE CONTROL BEFORE HINTZE
FINDS OUT HIS TEAM FAILED?

930
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,356
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

931
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,325
MS. STARNDORF,
PLEASE COME WITH US.

932
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,094
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS THE FACILITY.

933
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,233
BUT I CAN'T
LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS.

934
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,605
ANNA, HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED YOU TO STOP HINTZE.

935
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,507
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

936
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:22,178
HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN.

937
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,280
I KNOW, BUT FATHER
CARED TOO MUCH FOR OTHER PEOPLE

938
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,449
AND TOO LITTLE FOR HIMSELF.

939
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,352
THAT'S WHY MY MOTHER LEFT HIM.

940
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,354
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID
A LOT OF GOOD

941
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,255
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.

942
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,060
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

943
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,162
WHAT MADE YOU GO LOOKING
FOR YOUR FAMILY AGAIN?

944
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,432
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
ALL YOU WANTED.

945
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,435
WE HAVE TO FINISH WHAT WE'RE
DOING HERE FIRST...

946
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,572
THEN I'LL FIND MY FAMILY.

947
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,474
IT LOOKS WE'RE BOTH
MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE

948
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,843
THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT.

949
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,578
- YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

950
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,549
- YEP, I'M GONNA PUKE.

951
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,158
- DON'T MOVE!

952
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,330
- WHERE'S THE DOCTOR?

953
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,199
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM?

954
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,372
- HE'S DEAD.

955
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,807
- SEE, HERR HINTZE WAS RIGHT.

956
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,476
OKAY, H-HOLD ON,
WE DIDN'T KILL HIM.

957
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,612
- WAIT. THE GIRL WAS WITH THEM.

958
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,347
SHE MUST HAVE SEEN
WHAT HAPPENED.

959
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,284
DID THEY KILL THE DOCTOR?

960
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,856
- THEN WHO DID?

961
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:44,360
- NOW, JUST A SECOND!

962
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,568
THE REAR ENTRANCE TUNNEL LEADS
RIGHT TO THE MAIN LINE.

963
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,903
- GUARDED?
- ONE GUARD.

964
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,204
- HOW MANY PEOPLE INSIDE?

965
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,539
FIVE, MAYBE SIX
IN THE INSTITUTE,

966
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,441
AND TWO MORE
PATROLLING THE MAIN TUNNEL.

967
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,143
OKAY, SO, WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO CREATE A DIVERSION

968
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:03,179
IN THE MAIN TUNNEL
TO DRAW THE GUARDS AWAY.

969
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,313
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

970
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,514
- YES.
- OKAY! LET'S GO!

971
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,351
- WAIT, HOLD ON.

972
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:10,586
- WE STAY.

973
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,421
I NEED YOU TO STAY HERE, OKAY?

974
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:15,291
MY DOG, SAS... HE HATES
TO BE ALONE, OKAY?

975
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,425
SO, SAS.

976
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,928
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAY
WITH HIM UNTIL I COME BACK?

977
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:22,531
YES? OKAY? SAS, STAY.
STAY, SAS.

978
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,798
ARE YOU SURE
THIS WILL WORK, HENLEY?

979
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,566
- NEVER FAILS.

980
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,486
- HOW DID IT GO?

981
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,888
- PERFECTLY.

982
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,491
OH, YEAH, AND I DO
HAVE A NICE ASS.

983
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,231
- OKAY, WE SPLIT UP.

984
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,332
YOU'RE WITH ME.

985
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:31,600
COME ON, LET'S GO.

986
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,816
GOOD WORK. NO ALARMS.

987
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:30,452
TILL WE'RE THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN TANGIERS.

988
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,088
YEAH, WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

989
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,594
- HE DOESN'T LOOK WELL.

990
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,503
HE'S LOOKING AT A MONITOR.

991
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,438
CHECKING THE FLIGHT PATH
OF SolStar-2.

992
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,873
- NO, NO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S...

993
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,575
- A SECURITY-CAMERA MONITOR?

994
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,111
HEY, GUYS, HOW YOU DOING?
WELCOME TO BERLIN!

995
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,113
BEEN A FEW CHANGES
SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST,

996
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,615
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU NOTICED THAT.

997
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,883
HI, ANNA.

998
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,653
DID YOU MISS ME?
I MISSED YOU.

999
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,588
"WHY, SURE, KLAUS. HOW YOU BEEN?
WHAT'S GOING ON?"

1000
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,857
OH, YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT... JUST
CHILLING OUT.

1001
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,460
DO YOU GUYS LIKE MY NEW
SECURITY MODIFICATIONS?

1002
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,598
MNH! NICE SHOT, SOLDIER.

1003
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:21,870
WELL, WELL, WELL, COLONEL,
UH...WALKER, ISN'T IT?

1004
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:23,839
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, HINTZE?

1005
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,041
- NOTHING YOU CAN GIVE ME...SIR.

1006
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,910
SIR, YES, SIR!

1007
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,813
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1008
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,816
HM, OKAY, UM,
I'D LIKE TO TRAVEL THE WORLD,

1009
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,018
HELP CHILDREN,
AND OPEN A BOUTIQUE.

1010
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,955
NO, I'D
ACTUALLY LIKE MY LIFE BACK.

1011
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,623
YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE
I WAS GONNA HAVE...

1012
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:43,425
THE WIFE, THE KIDS,
THE HOUSE, THE BARBECUE,

1013
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,893
THE DISTINGUISHED
ACADEMIC CAREER.

1014
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,795
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
THAT ON YOU, COLONEL, DO YA?

1015
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,597
I DIDN'T THINK YOU DID.
TRAVELING LIGHT?

1016
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,132
AND WHAT'S THAT?
A PLACE IN THE SUN?

1017
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,000
LIFETIME SUPPLY OF PLAYMATES?

1018
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,136
24/7 HAPPY HOUR
AT THE LOCAL BAR?

1019
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,039
WELL, THAT'S VERY TEMPTING...
SUN, WOMEN, AND LIQUOR.

1020
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,907
MNAH!

1021
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,677
GODDAMN IT, COLONEL, THROW IN
A BACK RUB AND YOU GOT A DEAL!

1022
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,813
DO YOU THINK THAT ANYTHING
THAT YOU COULD OFFER ME

1023
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:07,583
COULD COMPENSATE
FOR THESE THREE YEARS IN HELL?

1024
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,118
- HE'S CRAZY.

1025
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,187
NOW, THAT'S A CHEAP SHOT,
COLONEL, AND I RESENT IT.

1026
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,455
I REALLY DO.

1027
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,124
"CRAZY"!

1028
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,926
WELL, EVEN IF I WAS, IT DOESN'T
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE ME DEAF,

1029
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:18,994
SO BE POLITE.

1030
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,130
SHOW SOME RESPECT, YOU BASTARD!

1031
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,065
- KLAUS, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

1032
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:25,601
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO MY FATHER?

1033
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:28,837
- ANNA, I LOVE YOUR FATHER.

1034
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,572
WELL, I LOVED HIM
UNTIL I FIND OUT

1035
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,107
THAT THE HYPOCRITICAL BASTARD
HAD GONE AND BETRAYED ME.

1036
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,943
HE STABBED ME IN THE HEART,
AND THAT REALLY HURT.

1037
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:38,547
HE TOLD ME SolStar-2
WAS ALL ABOUT PEACE...

1038
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,216
"BRINGING PEACE
TO AN ENERGY-STARVED WORLD"...

1039
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,652
AND THEN NEGOTIATED
WITH THE MILITARY

1040
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:47,956
TO FUND IT BEHIND MY BACK...
HIS CHIEF ENGINEER, SEVEN YEARS!

1041
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,162
BET YOU ALL KNOW
ALL ABOUT THAT, COLONEL.

1042
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,930
- KLAUS, IT WAS ABOUT FUNDING.

1043
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,799
THE WORLD ISN'T BLACK AND WHITE.

1044
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:59,034
OH, IT IS. WELL,
IT'S WHITE, ANYWAY. IT'S WHITE.

1045
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,803
IT'S WHITE, WHITE, WHITE, WHITE!

1046
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,205
BUT YOUR BASTARD FATHER...
HE SAID TO ME,

1047
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,007
"KLAUS, WE MUST STAY HERE

1048
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,842
AND HELP THE OTHERS
UNTIL THE RESCUERS COME."

1049
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,778
ARE YOU THE RESCUERS? YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE THE RESCUERS.

1050
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,947
THEY DIDN'T COME! BUT ME
AND MY BOYS... WE GOT ORGANIZED.

1051
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,081
WE KNOW THE DEAL.

1052
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,983
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

1053
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,520
WE'RE PRETTY PISSED OFF
ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND,

1054
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,690
SO WE DECIDED
TO GIVE YOU GUYS A WAKE-UP CALL

1055
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,826
AND, UH, WRITE SOME HISTORY
AT THE SAME TIME.

1056
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,027
YES, SIR.

1057
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,829
- IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

1058
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,797
I HATE TO
CONTRADICT YOU, DARLING,

1059
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,132
BUT I HAVE THE BIGGEST GUN,

1060
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,634
WHICH MEANS IT'S
WHOSEVER FAULT I SAY IT IS.

1061
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,169
YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF READING

1062
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,571
WHILE I'VE BEEN HERE...
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ELSE TO DO.

1063
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:36,972
SHAKESPEARE...
YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

1064
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,841
HE'S REALLY GOOD,
GOT A LOT OF GOOD SOUND BITES.

1065
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,676
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING?
HOW ABOUT THIS...

1066
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,212
"AS FLIES,
ARE WE, TO THE WANTON GODS.

1067
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,747
THEY KILL US FOR THEIR SPORT."

1068
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,083
WHICH MAKES YOU
AND EVERYBODY ELSE THE FLIES.

1069
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,319
AND ME... BAH, WELL,
YOU GET THE PICTURE.

1070
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:53,155
IF I TRY AND BREAK THIS LOCK,
IT WILL SELF-DESTRUCT

1071
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,224
AND THE PASSWORD
IS 512-BIT ENCODED.

1072
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,560
WELL, WE'VE GOT LESS THAN
TWO HOURS BEFORE THAT NUTBAR

1073
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,128
HAS ENOUGH POWER
TO BLOW UP TANGIERS, HERE.

1074
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,064
- ANNA. ANNA.

1075
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,699
WE NEED YOUR FATHER'S PASSWORD.

1076
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,100
- I DON'T KNOW IT.

1077
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:08,570
HE TOLD YOU THAT...
TO REMEMBER, OKAY?

1078
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:09,938
SO IT JUST MEANS YOU KNEW IT
AT ONE POINT IN TIME, RIGHT?

1079
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,173
SO, JUST THINK.

1080
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,214
WELL, THAT'S
SEVEN POINTS FOR TRYING.

1081
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,149
COME ON, GUYS! YOU CAN GET IT.

1082
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,986
ONLY 7 TRILLION
POSSIBILITIES TO GO.

1083
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,622
I KIND OF HOPE YOU GET IT.

1084
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,727
I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU GUYS
SINCE WE'RE GETTING ON SO WELL,

1085
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,629
BUT I GOT MY DUTY.
I GOT A JOB TO DO.

1086
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,197
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
COLONEL.

1087
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,933
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
I GOT A CITY TO DESTROY.

1088
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,168
YOU CAN STAY AND WATCH
IF YOU WANT.

1089
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,737
- WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU, HINTZE?

1090
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,872
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A VERY
INTERESTING QUESTION.

1091
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,008
AS A DELAY TACTIC,
IT'S ALSO NOT SO BAD.

1092
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,042
IT'S... IT'S HARD TO ANSWER.

1093
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,710
IT'S A LOT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW.

1094
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,946
IT'S BETRAYAL, JUSTICE, REVENGE,
WHICH IS VERY SWEET.

1095
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,348
I'M REALLY BEYOND ALL THAT.

1096
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,950
LET'S JUST STAY
WITH THE INSANE THEORY, HUH?

1097
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,585
KEEP IT SIMPLE. THAT'S MY MOTTO.

1098
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,321
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING
VERY CLOSE,

1099
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:02,291
AND, UH, YOU CAN STAY AND WATCH,
BUT YOU GOT TO BE QUIET, OKAY?

1100
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:04,960
I LIKE TO WORK TO MUSIC,
SO EXCUSE ME.

1101
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,970
- I DON'T KNOW HIS PASSWORD.

1102
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:16,939
COME ON, ANNA.
HE TOLD YOU TO REMEMBER.

1103
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,006
REMEMBER WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1104
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,207
REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT?

1105
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,743
- WHAT ABOUT HIS FAVORITE COLOR?

1106
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,679
HE'D COME UP WITH THESE
COMPLICATED PASSWORDS

1107
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,047
THAT HE'D ALWAYS FORGET.

1108
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,882
WE HAD TO ANALOG HIS NOTEBOOK
EVERY WEEK.

1109
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,151
I ALWAYS TOLD HIM
THAT THE ONLY GOOD PASSWORD

1110
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,320
IS ONE YOU CAN REMEMBER.

1111
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,387
- THE NAME OF HIS MISTRESS?

1112
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,330
- WHAT A SECOND. I'VE GOT IT.

1113
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,065
IT'S "REMEMBER."

1114
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,400
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WAIT. WAIT.

1115
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,970
HE'LL HEAR THE SYSTEM DISENGAGE.

1116
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,138
LET'S GET READY.

1117
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,453
OKAY.

1118
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:06,254
AND...GO!

1119
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,294
- YOU REMEMBERED.

1120
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,396
BUT YOU'RE TOO LATE!

1121
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,474
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!

1122
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:27,075
HE WAS NO THREAT.

1123
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,044
I DIDN'T SEE IT
LIKE THAT, COLONEL.

1124
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,980
I HAVE TO TRY
TO OVERRIDE THE PROGRAM.

1125
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,483
DO IT. WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

1126
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:36,952
OH, MY GOD.

1127
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,087
THE BASTARD SAW US COMING
THE WHOLE WAY.

1128
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:42,024
HE'S GOT SECURITY CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE.

1129
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,033
- I USED TO LIVE RIGHT THERE.

1130
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:56,004
MY DAUGHTER USED TO PLAY
IN THE PARK ACROSS THE STREET.

1131
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,975
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

1132
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,276
- FOR WHAT?

1133
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,011
- BEFORE.

1134
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:03,979
YOUR FAMILY.

1135
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,148
ORDERING YOU TO LEAVE.

1136
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,150
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO FORGIVE AND FORGET, COLONEL,

1137
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,185
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

1138
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,455
NOT A SINGLE DAY GOES BY WHERE
I DON'T REGRET THAT DECISION

1139
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:16,058
TO FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS
AND GET ON THAT PLANE.

1140
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:19,327
SO, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND OUT
WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO FIND OUT?

1141
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,163
- SHIT.

1142
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,431
- WHAT IS IT, HENLEY?

1143
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:25,400
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
FOLLOWED US HERE.

1144
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:28,503
- IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

1145
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,739
- I'LL GO GET HER.

1146
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,209
- GOOD IDEA, PARKER.

1147
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:45,287
SO, HAVE YOU GOT CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE YET?

1148
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,456
- ALMOST, YEAH.
- JUST RELAX, HENLEY.

1149
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:50,058
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, COLONEL.

1150
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,460
I'M VERY RELAXED.

1151
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,364
SIT DOWN!

1152
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:00,035
NOW, SHUT THE DOOR
AND CHANGE THE PASSWORD.

1153
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:03,271
WE DON'T WANT TO LET PARKER
INTERRUPT US, NOW, DO WE?

1154
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:24,493
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE
PROBABLY GOT SOME QUESTIONS.

1155
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:26,061
- YES.

1156
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,497
JUST AS WELL.
I'VE GOT THE ANSWERS, THEN.

1157
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,365
SEE, WHEN THE MILITARY FOUND OUT

1158
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:31,967
THAT THE SATELLITE
WAS STILL FUNCTIONING,

1159
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,335
SOME OF US WEREN'T TOO HAPPY

1160
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,471
WITH THE IDEA OF DESTROYING
A PERFECTLY GOOD WEAPON.

1161
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:40,008
UNFORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT
HARRISON DIDN'T QUITE AGREE.

1162
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,344
SO, YOU SEE,
I WAS PLANTED ON THIS MISSION

1163
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:45,247
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WEAPON
WASN'T DESTROYED.

1164
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,515
WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH IT?

1165
01:19:46,548 --> 01:19:48,250
- I WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

1166
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,051
CHANGE THE WORLD.

1167
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,454
ANNA, THE ARABS HAVE
RAISED THE PRICE OF GAS

1168
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,256
TO NEARLY $100 A GALLON.

1169
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,091
THEY'RE SQUEEZING US
BECAUSE THEY KNOW

1170
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,194
2/3 OF THE WORLD IS HIDDEN
UNDER ICE AND NEEDS THE ENERGY.

1171
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,997
NOW, IF, SAY,
SOME ROGUE MILITANT GROUP

1172
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,199
HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THE ICE
TURNS THE SATELLITE ON,

1173
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:05,967
SAY, UH, MECCA,

1174
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:09,037
I THINK IT COULD BE A VERY
DIFFERENT STORY, DON'T YOU?

1175
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,405
YOU DO THIS
AND YOU COULD START A WAR.

1176
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,943
THERE'S GONNA BE A WAR
SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY.

1177
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,645
SOME OF US ARE SICK
OF BEING GUESTS

1178
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:17,946
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S COUNTRIES.

1179
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,915
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE BE A DEAR

1180
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:23,351
AND REDIRECT SolStar-2
ACCORDING TO THESE COORDINATES?

1181
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:39,634
- HEY.

1182
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,103
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY.

1183
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,975
THAT'S IT? A SHRUG?

1184
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,677
A NOD. OKAY.

1185
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:52,614
NOW, A NOD'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

1186
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,382
SAS, YOU KNOW BETTER.

1187
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,052
COME ON.

1188
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,019
SHH.

1189
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,957
SAS.

1190
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,704
Do you know what happens
if I lose my patience?

1191
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,038
- You'll shoot me?

1192
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,506
- Very good.

1193
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:24,479
AND IN YOUR CASE,
I'LL ACTUALLY ENJOY IT.

1194
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,733
- But then you won't have anyone

1195
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,701
to control
the satellite for you.

1196
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,104
- OH, YOU SEE, HERE'S THE THING.

1197
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:53,441
IF I KILL YOU AND THERE'S NO ONE
LEFT TO CONTROL THE SATELLITE,

1198
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,043
I'LL JUST GO HOME.

1199
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,679
I'LL HAVE SAVED THE WORLD,
SO I'LL BE A HERO.

1200
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,648
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO GET HOME?

1201
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,249
THE TRUCKS ARE GONE.

1202
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:03,551
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

1203
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,687
On the other hand,
if you help me fry the Arabs

1204
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,722
then the people
that sent me on this mission,

1205
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,424
they're gonna
pay me $10 million.

1206
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,659
I THINK THAT SHOULD
JUST ABOUT BE ENOUGH

1207
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,360
TO BUY MYSELF
A PLACE IN THE SUN.

1208
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:17,299
- SHIT.

1209
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,379
- I need the manual.

1210
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,614
- WHAT DO YOU THE MANUAL FOR?

1211
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,416
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
HOW THIS WORKED.

1212
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,551
I HAVEN'T USED THIS PROGRAM
FOR THREE YEARS.

1213
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:38,386
HINTZE DID
SOME MODIFICATIONS, OKAY?

1214
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,256
NO, NO, NO. SIT DOWN.
I'LL GET IT. WHERE IS IT?

1215
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,590
- OVER THERE.

1216
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,129
- KEEP WORKING.

1217
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,191
- ANNA, YOU ALL RIGHT?

1218
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:17,559
- OH, SHE'S JUST FINE, PARKER.

1219
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,461
NOW, DROP YOUR GUN
AND SHE WON'T GET HURT.

1220
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,397
HENLEY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

1221
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,065
AAH!

1222
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,067
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

1223
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:30,205
THAT WAS JUST A FLESH WOUND.
THE NEXT ONE WON'T BE.

1224
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:34,242
NOW, REDIRECT MY SATELLITE,
OTHERWISE I'LL SHOOT HIM!

1225
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:36,611
GET RID OF THE GUN.

1226
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:43,184
JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE,
OTHERWISE I'LL SHOOT HER.

1227
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,521
YOU KNOW, THOUGH,
TWO AGAINST ONE

1228
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,757
KIND OF STILL
SEEMS UNFAIR, DOESN'T IT?

1229
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:54,162
I ONLY FUCKED YOU
TO SCREW WITH YOUR HEAD.

1230
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,197
BUT ACTUALLY, IT TURNED OUT
TO BE QUITE ENJOYABLE.

1231
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:01,536
NOW, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS,

1232
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:02,737
BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

1233
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,473
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO DO.

1234
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:16,384
STOP!

1235
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:19,354
AAH!

1236
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,737
OH, TOM,
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

1237
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,739
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO END UP
LOSING ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL,

1238
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:39,574
NOW, WOULD YOU?

1239
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,528
- AAAAAAAAH!

1240
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,557
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

1241
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,726
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONES

1242
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:33,895
TRYING TO GET
CONTROL OF SolStar-2.

1243
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:35,263
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

1244
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:42,504
LET'S KILL THIS SATELLITE
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

1245
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,771
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

1246
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,642
WHAT'S THAT?
- MY FATHER'S IDEA.

1247
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:50,845
INCIDENTAL CALCULATIONS.
IT COULD WORK.

1248
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,915
SolStar-2 CAN
KICKSTART THE WEATHER.

1249
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,751
- HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE?

1250
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:59,654
- ALL CALCULATIONS ARE DONE.

1251
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,257
WE JUST HAVE TO TRY IT.

1252
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,958
- OKAY. GOOD. LET'S DO IT.

1253
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,594
WHAT ABOUT THE ORDER
THAT WE HAVE

1254
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,963
TO DESTROY SolStar-2
AT ANY COST?

1255
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,866
- I TRUST YOU.

1256
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,001
- OKAY.

1257
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,747
OH, SHIT.

1258
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,649
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1259
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:30,585
THE DISH ON THE ROOF
IS DISCONNECTED.

1260
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:31,653
- ALL RIGHT.

1261
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,555
I'LL GO CONNECT THE DISH.

1262
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,924
YOU KEEP DOING YOUR THING.
- ARE YOU SURE?

1263
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,892
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO
PROGRAM THE SATELLITE.

1264
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,928
- OKAY.

1265
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:17,665
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THAT EASY, YEAH?

1266
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:32,747
BYE, PARKER.

1267
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:10,618
SO, YOU'RE MAKING A HABIT
OF SAVING MY LIFE.

1268
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,854
I GUESS YOU OWE ME.

1269
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:15,657
LET ME KNOW
HOW I CAN REPAY YOU.

1270
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:18,826
- LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

1271
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,883
"I DON'T KNOW
IF ANYONE IS GETTING THROUGH,

1272
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,551
"BUT THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE.

1273
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:24,652
"THE SUN IS SETTING,

1274
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,855
"AND I'M GOING TO JOIN
OUR LITTLE PRINCESS IN BED.

1275
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,858
"THE NIGHTS ARE BITTERLY COLD
AND GETTING COLDER.

1276
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:34,896
"HOLDING HER IN MY ARMS BRINGS
US BOTH WARMTH AND COMFORT.

1277
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:35,963
"I LOVE YOU.

1278
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,999
MORE LATER. SANDRA."

1279
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,903
- I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

1280
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:26,607
NOW IT'S REAL.

1281
01:32:29,076 --> 01:32:33,915
IF THIS WORKS OUT, THERE WILL
BE A LOT TO DO AROUND HERE.

1282
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:56,871
LOOKS LIKE
YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.

1283
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:58,105
- LET'S HOPE.

1284
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:04,378
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

1285
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:07,014
THAT'S THE SUN.
