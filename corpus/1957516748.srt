[dramatic music]

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,358
[plane humming]

6
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:21,800
[Williams] Charlie,
Roger, 031915, almost home.

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,492
[plane humming]

8
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,104
[Zuchowski] Charlie,
Roger, 040904,

9
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,134
coming in, tower,
I have no issues.

10
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,804
[plane humming]

11
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:36,181
[Bender] Adam, Tex 699543,

12
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:38,975
coming in, no problems.

13
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:41,178
[plane humming]

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,488
[McGee] E.T, that's
Easy, Tara, 0710992

15
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:51,320
coming in, no problems.

16
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,999
[plane humming]

17
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,939
Gentlemen, we're
under 10,000 feet.

18
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05,769
They gave us hell for a
while, didn't they, Major?

19
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:07,270
[Cole] They sure did, Eddy.

20
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:09,773
How many of those German
rocket planes did you see?

21
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:12,885
Caught a glimpse of
one, moving really fast.

22
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:14,820
Hey, Joe!

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,147
[Joe] I'm here.

24
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,724
How many of those German
jets you see from back there?

25
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,252
[Joe] Two, I think.

26
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,964
They're so damn fast
you can barely see them.

27
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,192
What the hell is that?

28
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,862
[rocket humming]

29
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,038
Looks like a rocket.

30
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:34,840
Anti-aircraft?

31
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,009
[Cole] I don't think so.

32
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:39,736
One of those jets?

33
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:41,503
[Cole] It's too big.

34
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,447
Ain't never seen that before.

35
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,442
Definitely gotta report
this to Colonel Richards

36
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,112
when we get back to base.

37
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,890
[dramatic music]

38
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,404
So, how are things in Berlin?

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,434
The atmosphere is tense,
as you might expect.

40
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:16,106
What was the Fuhrer's
decision regarding my jets?

41
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,209
The resources are
staying with the V-2.

42
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:23,013
The Fuhrer feels that the
retribution program is the future

43
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:24,915
of the Third Reich.

44
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:27,083
Unless we have a
deterrent in the air,

45
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,219
all of this will not matter.

46
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:31,721
The problem is
personnel, Colonel.

47
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:35,025
Rockets require no pilots,
and the trajectories

48
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:38,728
towards the London area
have been very precise.

49
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,098
Your program requires an
extensive training of the pilots

50
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,077
that are available, and
that number is dwindling.

51
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:58,290
Since when do Jews get
their own offices here?

52
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,453
He works developing propulsion
systems under von Braun.

53
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,556
And he studied under Einstein.

54
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,657
You're not paying
him, are you?

55
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,327
Of course not.

56
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,330
All he cares about is
the safety of his family.

57
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:15,098
They are laborers here.

58
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,042
Difficult work, I imagine?

59
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:18,743
Extremely.

60
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:20,946
Sir.

61
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,752
Excuse me, General, I
have a nation to defend.

62
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,848
Good morning, gentlemen.

63
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,691
Are you here to represent
the fighter pilots?

64
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,786
Pretty much everyone
in our squadron, sir.

65
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:40,156
Okay, then, tell me,
what seems to be the beef?

66
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:42,392
Well, these orders
about cutting back

67
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:45,028
on radio communications
during the fight.

68
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,563
I don't see how that's
gonna work, sir.

69
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:49,833
That's what keeping
us alive up there, sir.

70
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,667
It ain't like the 17's.

71
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,870
They got their formation
and their rules.

72
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,706
That's right, and their
rule is absolute radio silence

73
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:59,575
until they turn around for home.

74
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:02,278
Because what they're doing
has order to it, Colonel.

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,747
That's right.

76
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,750
Point man drops his payload,
then all the others know to go.

77
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:08,584
Ain't the way it is for us.

78
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:13,023
When those bandits come
in, it's absolute chaos.

79
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,324
Exactly.

80
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,493
Have you ever been
up in the air, sir?

81
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,294
Couple of times last year.

82
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,230
But that was before
we had you, boys,

83
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:23,366
so please don't ever think
that we don't appreciate

84
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,843
you being up there with us.

85
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:27,569
So let me clarify.

86
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,006
The purpose of the orders
is not to prevent you

87
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:32,342
from alerting the
rest of your squadron

88
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:35,611
if they're in danger, or
if there's any danger.

89
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:39,482
The purpose of the orders
is to not alert the Germans

90
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:43,086
as to where we're at, what
we're doing, where we're going,

91
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:45,455
what our payload is, and so on.

92
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:46,431
You understand?

93
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,625
Okay, I understand.

94
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,528
So work with me on this.

95
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,040
Chatter all you want
only when it's necessary.

96
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:59,269
You gotta back off on
helping their intelligence.

97
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,204
Now, once all the
bombs are dropped,

98
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:02,872
it's no longer an issue.

99
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,040
Okay?

100
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,475
Okay, sir.

101
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:07,844
We'll make sure this
clarification gets around.

102
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,379
I would appreciate it.

103
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,613
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

104
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:14,851
I've got to address my bomber
crews in less than 30 minutes.

105
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:17,628
[dramatic music]

106
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:37,082
[bleeping]

107
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,989
[bleeping]

108
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,496
My primary concern,
Herr Captain, is safety.

109
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:03,466
My last station was in a high
security bombproof facility

110
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,177
that is now in rubble.

111
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:09,339
We are impenetrable here.

112
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:12,175
The rockets are a prime
target for the British,

113
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:14,186
so they bomb, they
bomb, they bomb.

114
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,924
Down here we get
a little rumble.

115
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,385
Ah, this is Issac.

116
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:24,287
Rocket propulsion.

117
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,164
His is the next office.

118
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,627
So he is one of the
Reich's protected Jews?

119
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,531
He's quite brilliant, and
very important to our cause.

120
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:35,974
It's all right, Siegfried.

121
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:39,102
Delighted to make
your acquaintance.

122
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,937
Fraulein Falenburg.

123
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,805
Von Falenburg.

124
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,917
My apologies,
Fraulein Von Falenburg.

125
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:50,313
So when would you like
to begin your broadcast?

126
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:52,582
I start tonight after dinner.

127
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:55,418
And you will please ask the
cook to prepare some fish

128
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,953
for my Siegfried.

129
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:59,255
Ja, Liebehen, you would
like some fish, ja?

130
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:01,724
I know you do not like
to be next to the Jews.

131
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,526
- I do not like it either.
- Fucking cats!

132
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,995
Cole, I have to talk with
you about your brother.

133
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,397
[plane humming]

134
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,898
[Cole] What's
he done now, sir?

135
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm not talking about
his practical jokes.

136
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:13,770
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to pull him from your plane.

137
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,004
Why, sir?

138
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,673
Because he's you're
only brother, Cole.

139
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:18,274
It's just you and him, right?

140
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,109
No other brothers or sisters?

141
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,144
Yes, sir, that's right.

142
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:22,579
This has been shaping up ever

143
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,048
since those brothers
were lost in the Pacific.

144
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,183
I have nothing to do with this.

145
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:29,919
This is coming directly
from Headquarters Command.

146
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,463
I don't have any other choice.

147
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,125
I understand, sir.

148
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,193
Can I tell him myself?

149
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,027
Yeah.

150
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,162
See to it.

151
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:39,963
- After the briefing.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:40,939
Yes, sir, thank you.

153
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,601
Well, fellas, we got
the weather forecast.

154
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:46,402
It's not looking good.

155
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,071
They're calling for a clear sky

156
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,307
with very partial cloud
cover tomorrow morning.

157
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:53,509
Just remember how
lucky you are compared

158
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,245
to the crews last year.

159
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,580
They didn't have P-51's
to keep them company

160
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,148
all the way there and back.

161
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,516
They were on their own.

162
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:02,552
Let's hear it for
our little friends!

163
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:04,554
[applauding]

164
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:06,256
All right, all
right, knock it off.

165
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,423
Sir, how many planes are

166
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,226
on the mission tomorrow,
including escorts?

167
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,730
Between 700 and 800, Cole.

168
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:15,632
Sir, with a grid that big,
any bullet fired anywhere

169
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:18,368
in the sky's bound to
hit one of our planes.

170
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,069
Yeah, well, people
with more rank than me

171
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:21,671
want these factories taken out,

172
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:24,374
and they've decided that
this is the way to do it.

173
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,577
Besides, grids shouldn't
be that tight, anyway.

174
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,646
Someone above you
gets hit and falls,

175
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:31,681
you don't want him
falling on you.

176
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:33,850
More planes, fewer missions.

177
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:34,784
Makes sense.

178
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,286
More planes, more missions.

179
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:37,954
That's the way it goes.

180
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:41,257
We've got a job to do and
that's to win this damn war.

181
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,761
If it takes 1,000
planes every day,

182
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:45,695
then by God that's what we do.

183
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:48,398
What about these rocket
planes we've been seeing, sir?

184
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,434
Rumor has it they're twice
as fast as our newest 51's.

185
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,403
I'm gonna let Lt. Colonel
Thompson brief you in

186
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:54,837
on what he knows about that.

187
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,714
Rob.

188
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:57,849
Thank you, Colonel.

189
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,178
They're not rockets.

190
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,314
They're a twin jet design,
but they're not as fast

191
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:07,417
as everybody's crying about,
but they're certainly faster

192
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,252
than anything we've
got right now.

193
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:11,554
Why don't we have
something like that, sir?

194
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,156
Well, we will, we will.

195
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:14,957
How are the
Germans building them

196
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,327
when we're bombing the
crap out of them every day

197
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,829
and the Brits are
slamming them every night?

198
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,931
That's why we have to
keep bombing the crap out

199
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,466
of them every day.

200
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,135
The other day I saw
something on a mission.

201
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:29,639
And it wasn't a jet plane, it
was a rocket, sir, a big one.

202
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,274
Straight out of science fiction.

203
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,753
And it was moving
fast, very fast.

204
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,655
Anybody else see
anything like this?

205
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,785
All right, gentlemen, I
know you get it pounded

206
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:44,187
into your head every
day about keeping quiet

207
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:45,988
about classified information.

208
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,727
And it's critical, very
critical, in this case.

209
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,437
What these men have seen is
no longer science fiction.

210
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:56,399
These Nazis for a long time
have had these buzz bombs.

211
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,434
We can shoot them out of
the sky with fighters.

212
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,804
We can blow them out of the sky.

213
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,405
But they've got
something new now,

214
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,540
and they call it a
vengeance weapon.

215
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,942
It's a large rocket.

216
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:08,344
It travels at supersonic speeds,

217
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,413
and it's been terrorizing London

218
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:14,016
and the surrounding area
almost on a daily basis.

219
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:16,619
But that's about as much as
I can share with you now.

220
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:20,022
But when we get more information,
I'll pass it along to you.

221
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:21,524
Colonel, let's get on
with your briefing.

222
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:22,492
[Richards] Thanks, Rob.

223
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:23,435
[Cole] Hey, Joe.

224
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,697
Cole, what you thinking?

225
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:30,500
Well, everybody's afraid
of those rocket planes.

226
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,771
Well, they'll blow up and
burn down like the rest of them.

227
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,238
Right?

228
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,572
Yeah.

229
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,974
I Guess so.

230
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,276
Listen, Colonel
Richards came by,

231
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,445
and he says that I gotta
pull you off my bird.

232
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,913
You gotta go to another crate.

233
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,591
[plane humming]

234
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,152
For what reason?

235
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:52,255
Well, apparently they don't
want family members going down

236
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,164
in the same wreck.

237
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,993
Never bothered them before.

238
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:57,828
I know.

239
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,838
It's not my decision.

240
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,598
You sure about that?

241
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,108
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

242
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:06,969
Even though you're my brother,

243
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,337
you're the best tail gunner
in the whole theater.

244
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,248
I'm really not happy
about this, Joe.

245
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,508
All right.

246
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,477
Maybe I'll just tell you
what number I'm in up there.

247
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,311
You can pick me out.

248
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,847
That'll be the trick.

249
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,347
There's gonna be a lot of
metal in the sky tomorrow.

250
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,059
[plane humming]

251
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:26,222
Colonel Raiden, I do not feel

252
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:27,825
I have adequate
flying experience

253
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:30,201
to take the Me262 into combat.

254
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:35,465
I agree, Lieutenant,
but you have to understand

255
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:38,034
I need these jets in the air.

256
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:40,445
They are our last hope
for victory in this war.

257
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:44,674
My concern is their
lack of maneuverability.

258
00:12:44,716 --> 00:12:49,345
Keep in mind, I'm used to
these more agile 190's.

259
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,782
I've seen you in
the 262, Lieutenant,

260
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:53,616
and you've done well.

261
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:56,686
Just remember,
gradual acceleration

262
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:59,622
and gradual
deceleration is the key.

263
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,566
Tricky in a combat situation.

264
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,930
I'll do my best to
remember that, sir.

265
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:07,865
[Raiden] Good boy.

266
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:09,800
Good boy, he's a good boy.

267
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:12,577
[planes humming]

268
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,390
Eddy, what's up?

269
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:28,226
It's the Dresden Doll, Major.

270
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,765
Lord have mercy,
not that bitch again.

271
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,093
Good evening.

272
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:41,832
This is the Dresden Doll
here in beautiful Germany.

273
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:46,035
And there you are, my
sweet young heroes,

274
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:50,606
soaring high in the
heavens on your missions,

275
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:53,744
certain that you are
fighting as honorably

276
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:55,186
as the knights of old.

277
00:13:56,654 --> 00:14:01,284
But think for a moment,
what are you really doing?

278
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:05,163
You are dropping your bombs
on the women and the children.

279
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:09,935
They are innocent civilians
who cannot defend themselves.

280
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,998
That is the work of a
butcher, not a soldier.

281
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,601
You are destroying
homes and families,

282
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:22,580
homes and families just
like yours in America.

283
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:27,878
And I know you miss your
home and your family,

284
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,321
and especially your sweetheart.

285
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:36,127
She must be so lonely,
she misses you so much.

286
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:40,131
But how long can
she wait for you?

287
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:43,492
And will she still want
you if you come back...

288
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,728
I don't like that

289
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,429
- on my aircraft.
- Without an arm?

290
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:49,240
[planes humming]

291
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,502
[Pilot] Some kind
of body's gotta go

292
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:55,038
with that bedroom voice.

293
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,773
I'd like to meet her.

294
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,207
[Pilot] Yeah, I bet you would.

295
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,953
[planes humming]

296
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:05,147
[Joe] Captain Bender,
I might have something.

297
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:06,083
[Bender] What do you got, Joe?

298
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,918
[Joe] Not 100% sure, sir.

299
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,886
It's behind us and low.

300
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,287
[Bender] Willis,
you see anything?

301
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,189
[Willis] Nothing
but our boys, Captain.

302
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,933
All right,
everybody stay sharp.

303
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:18,703
[Pilot] Check the sun.

304
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,732
[Pilot] What about it?

305
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:22,799
[Pilot] Just below it.

306
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:23,641
Something.

307
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,971
[Pilot] I think you're
hallucinating again.

308
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,305
[Pilot] Don't think so.

309
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:30,439
[Pilot] Just the sun, dog.

310
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,549
I don't see anything.

311
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:35,645
[Pilot] It's too
sunny out here.

312
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,480
I want more cloud cover.

313
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:38,581
[Pilot] I second that.

314
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:40,583
[Pilot] How far to the target?

315
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,451
[Pilot] Cut the
chatter about the target.

316
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:43,552
[Pilot] Roger that.

317
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,521
[planes humming]

318
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,565
[Lucas] Skipper,
I got bandits below!

319
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,469
[Cole] Bandits where, Lucas?

320
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:53,830
[Lucas] Below
and to the right.

321
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,174
Four, maybe five o'clock.

322
00:15:58,342 --> 00:15:59,903
[Cole] Joe, what you got?

323
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:03,606
Uh, sorry, tail gunner,
what do you see?

324
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:07,010
[planes humming]

325
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,745
[Pilot] What's
that at two o'clock?

326
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:11,247
[Pilot] Looks like
a flock of birds.

327
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:13,382
[Pilot] Some big birds.

328
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:15,584
[Pilot] This is trouble, boys.

329
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,686
[Pilot] What the hell?

330
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:19,388
[planes humming]

331
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,724
[Pilot] Oh, hell, bandits!

332
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:22,258
[Pilot] Good Lord!

333
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,693
[Pilot] Easy, men.

334
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:25,436
[Pilot] Do they
know we're here?

335
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:27,798
[Pilot] What the
hell are they doing?

336
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,298
[Pilot] Of course
they know we're here.

337
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,467
[Pilot] Are we supposed
to engage that whole group?

338
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,569
[planes humming]

339
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:36,973
[Pilot] What the hell kind
of Napoleonic tactic is this?

340
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,785
[dramatic music]

341
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,103
[planes humming]

342
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,242
[Joe] They're coming up
on the second grid, Captain.

343
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,245
[Bender] Get me closer, Joe.

344
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,216
[Willis] I can see something.

345
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:20,784
[Pilot] Don't shoot
points for this.

346
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:22,119
[Pilot] There they go!

347
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:24,897
[planes humming]

348
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:45,008
[Pilot] This is crazy!

349
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,777
[Pilot] Son of a bitch!

350
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,245
[Pilot] I can't
tell who's who!

351
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,079
[Pilot] One lane.

352
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:50,646
Brace it up out of here.

353
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:51,882
[Pilot] I see jets!

354
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:55,451
[planes humming]

355
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:56,318
[Pilot] Nine o'clock.

356
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,353
Nine!

357
00:17:57,395 --> 00:18:00,257
[plane humming]

358
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,025
[Pilot] This pack of
birds is just a diversion.

359
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,659
[Pilot] Protect the 17's.

360
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:04,761
Remember the mission.

361
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,538
[planes humming]

362
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:31,696
[guns firing]

363
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:37,060
[Pilot] Farmer down.

364
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:38,103
Farmer down.

365
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:40,797
[Pilot] Another one!

366
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,698
[Pilot] Do your job, fellas!

367
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,509
[dramatic music]

368
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,954
[screaming]

369
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,621
[plane crashing]

370
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:06,857
[Willis] What happened?

371
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,191
[Bender] We have
no controls at all.

372
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,903
[plane humming]

373
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:15,765
[Willis] We're gonna die!

374
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,067
[Bender] We're going down!

375
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:18,176
Abandon ship!

376
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:21,104
- Willis, get your chute!
- I can't!

377
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,815
[plane humming]

378
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:31,781
A fine performance.

379
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:33,116
Thank you, Captain.

380
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:35,394
I have a favor to ask of you.

381
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:37,988
A public relations issue.

382
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,864
Yeah?

383
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:45,904
There is a girl here working
for us, one of the laborers.

384
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:49,833
She has become enraptured
with your performances

385
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,245
and would very much like to
meet you if you have a moment.

386
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:55,546
Certainly.

387
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:01,978
Hello, madam, are
you the Dresden Doll?

388
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,147
That is my radio persona, yes.

389
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,882
Oh, it is an
honor to meet you.

390
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:08,285
I listen to you every
night on the radio.

391
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,119
Do you?

392
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:11,087
And what is your name?

393
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,322
Anna.

394
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:14,057
Well, Anna, what
do you do here?

395
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,993
I am in assembly, but
when I am older I want

396
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:18,862
to be just like you.

397
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:19,737
How charming.

398
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,874
Uh...

399
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:29,039
[Von Falenburg]
Where is she from?

400
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:30,681
Poland, originally.

401
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,220
You may leave now, Anna.

402
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,920
I want her eliminated.

403
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:45,487
Excuse me?

404
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,758
Executed, as soon as possible.

405
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,993
[he sighs]

406
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:52,228
And how would you
like this accomplished?

407
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,798
Do I have to tell a
Schutzstaffel officer how

408
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,598
to do his job?

409
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,103
Just make sure that the last
thing she hears is my voice

410
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,838
on the radio.

411
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,306
Very well.

412
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,875
Colonel Raiden's dog has
not had to work for his meal

413
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,219
in quite some time.

414
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,611
I hope he likes Polish food.

415
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,890
[chuckles]

416
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:14,951
[plane humming]

417
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:17,253
[Cole] Has anyone seen Bender?

418
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:20,423
Has anyone seen Captain Bender?

419
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:23,226
Captain Bender's
plane, Fire Down Below,

420
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,403
has anyone seen him?

421
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,163
Ain't seen nobody
from Bender's plane.

422
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:28,832
[plane humming]

423
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:30,400
[Cole] Anyone
seen Joe Phillips?

424
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:33,837
I thought Joe was the tail
gunner on your plane, sir.

425
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:34,636
[Cole] Sergeant Phillips?

426
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:35,514
Anyone seen Joe?

427
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,308
He got moved to
Bender's plane?

428
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,019
[plane humming]

429
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,687
[Henderson] Major?

430
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,761
Yes?

431
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:51,988
I saw Bender's plane.

432
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,989
Where?

433
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,124
In a fight.

434
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,566
But it didn't make it back.

435
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,862
Bender's plane
went down, Major.

436
00:21:58,904 --> 00:22:00,463
[plane humming]

437
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:02,032
It went down how?

438
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:05,168
It looked like
there was a collision.

439
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,169
A collision?

440
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:07,804
You saw this?

441
00:22:07,846 --> 00:22:11,141
Yeah, looked like one
of those jets hit it.

442
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:13,418
Are you sure it
was Bender's plane?

443
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,156
It happened real fast,
sir, but that's what I saw.

444
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:21,718
Did you see any shoots?

445
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,195
Flamed out fast.

446
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:26,056
I didn't see anyone get out.

447
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:28,767
[plane humming]

448
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:32,862
Thank you, sergeant.

449
00:22:32,904 --> 00:22:35,574
[plane humming]

450
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:40,212
[dramatic music]

451
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,412
[knocking on door]

452
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,214
It's just us, sweetheart.

453
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:52,457
I'm sorry it's so late.

454
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,956
What's wrong, Mama?

455
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:01,491
Nothing's wrong.

456
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,960
Your father and I just need
to talk to you for a minute.

457
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:04,994
Gonna go to
Grandma's tomorrow.

458
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:06,463
Would you like that?

459
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:09,732
Can I help Grandma make some
of her homemade ice cream?

460
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:10,967
[Joe] I sure hope so.

461
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,569
I could absolutely
use some of it.

462
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,971
Is something the
matter with Grandma?

463
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:18,308
Oh, no, we just need
to get everyone together

464
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,219
so we can talk about your
father and your uncle.

465
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:26,116
Are you gonna be
a soldier, Daddy?

466
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:28,551
[Joe] Why, yes, yes, I am.

467
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:29,919
I knew it.

468
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:32,288
How did you know that, Emily?

469
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,725
A lot of kids already
had their daddies leave.

470
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:38,370
How do you think Grandma's
gonna feel about this?

471
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,097
Well, we've always
been very patriotic.

472
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,041
I'm sure she'll be
just fine with it.

473
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,202
I cannot believe this!

474
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:47,737
You all come in here like this

475
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,140
making me the last
person to know!

476
00:23:50,182 --> 00:23:51,541
Shame on you!

477
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,084
Did he put you up to this?

478
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,279
No, Ma, we discussed it.

479
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:58,390
Well, you didn't
discuss it with me.

480
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:02,693
Can I talk to you in the other
room for a minute, please?

481
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,864
Yes, Ma.

482
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:15,298
Why is Grandma so mad?

483
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,499
She's just worried, Emily.

484
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,601
What were you thinking, Cole?

485
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:19,736
It wasn't me.

486
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:20,970
A lot of people are joining up.

487
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:22,172
Didn't you hear
the President, Ma?

488
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,773
I mean, we all have
to do our duty.

489
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:25,475
Everybody's gotta do their part.

490
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:28,244
Well, I imagine it was
the right thing to do.

491
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:29,145
Well, thank you.

492
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,647
- I -
- For you!

493
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:33,716
You've gone from here for 10
years, and I don't blame you.

494
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,952
This place is just a
tiny speck of a town

495
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:37,420
in the middle of nowhere.

496
00:24:37,462 --> 00:24:40,290
And, Cole, you've always
had bigger and better ideas,

497
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:42,125
and I'm proud of you, son.

498
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,526
Thanks, Ma.

499
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:44,627
But Joe's different.

500
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:45,762
He stayed.

501
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:47,030
He has a family now.

502
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:49,698
He's got a wife and a
beautiful little girl.

503
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,534
Don't get me wrong, son,

504
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:52,902
I don't want to see
you get hurt either,

505
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:54,571
- but Joe's...
- Yeah?

506
00:24:54,613 --> 00:24:57,240
Well, he doesn't have the
kind of common sense you have,

507
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:58,775
and he never has.

508
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:01,244
He's a grown man, and he
can take care of himself.

509
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:03,213
You know what I mean.

510
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:05,582
You've been taking care of
him since you all were little.

511
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:08,718
You kept him out of
trouble, you kept him safe.

512
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,987
I don't know the whys
or the wherefores,

513
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,597
but I've always appreciated it.

514
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:20,129
I made my decision
and he made his, Ma,

515
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:21,164
and we're going in.

516
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:22,040
It's our duty.

517
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,573
You promise me.

518
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:33,376
You promise me that you'll do
everything humanly possible

519
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:35,578
to look out for him and make
sure he doesn't get hurt.

520
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,180
You promise?

521
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:38,189
I will, Ma.

522
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:44,153
[dramatic music]
I'll take care of him.

523
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:46,931
[dramatic music]

524
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:50,268
Another.

525
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,474
Hello, Eddy.

526
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:05,317
What's going on?

527
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,045
[Eddy] I just
want to let you know

528
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:13,549
that I'm not the type of
guy to rat on a friend.

529
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:14,426
Okay.

530
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:17,787
[Eddy] I just wanted
to let you know that.

531
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:19,322
Here, have a seat.

532
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:20,265
[Eddy] Yes, sir.

533
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,805
What do you need
to tell me, Eddy?

534
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:29,474
It's Cole, sir.

535
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:32,043
Major Phillips.

536
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:34,837
I think he's gone AWOL.

537
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,139
AWOL?

538
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:37,015
Phillips?

539
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:39,642
That doesn't sound right.

540
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:40,552
I know, sir.

541
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:44,289
But this thing with
his brother and...

542
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:48,860
I mean, they were really close.

543
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:51,896
Well, when was the
last time you saw him?

544
00:26:52,765 --> 00:26:54,065
Right after we got back.

545
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:57,527
He's just vanished.

546
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:01,898
That's been about
what, 12, 14 hours ago?

547
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,399
Yes, sir.

548
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,567
I'll tell you what, Eddy.

549
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,903
Get a jeep pulled
around in front for us.

550
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,380
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

551
00:27:11,182 --> 00:27:13,676
Colonel, respectfully, I'd
rather not accompany you.

552
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:17,080
I don't want the Major thinking
I had any part of this, sir.

553
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:19,549
Very well, then, stay behind.

554
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:21,651
You have any idea where
Major Phillips might be?

555
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:22,885
Yes, sir.

556
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:25,254
I think he might be at
the pub, King's Pub.

557
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:26,322
Do you know where
that's located?

558
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:27,557
Yes, sir.

559
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,358
All right, well,
let the driver know.

560
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,859
Make sure he knows.

561
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:31,527
Sergeant Perry, do you
know where King's Pub is?

562
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:32,763
No.

563
00:27:32,805 --> 00:27:34,097
It's about five
miles southwest down

564
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:35,707
the main road off base.

565
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:37,934
Is that the one with
the uh, thatched roof?

566
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:39,502
Serves the 90 shilling?

567
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:41,037
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, I know where it is.

568
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,905
Thank you, Sergeant.

569
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:44,616
All right, we set?

570
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:48,854
[jeep engine starts up]

571
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:57,462
[people murmuring]

572
00:27:58,363 --> 00:27:59,164
Cole?

573
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,102
Cole.

574
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:05,729
[Cole] Yes, sir?

575
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,604
Look at me.

576
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:11,300
What the hell are
you doing out here?

577
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:12,870
What's it look
like I'm doing, sir?

578
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:13,813
Getting drunk.

579
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,273
Why don't you come
on back with us?

580
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:20,443
Get some hot chow and
some hot coffee in you.

581
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:22,412
You'll feel much better.

582
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:24,389
I'm really sorry
about this, Colonel.

583
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,350
Looks like I've cut pretty
heavy into your sleep.

584
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,218
Ah, don't worry about it.

585
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,297
But I am gonna have to pull
you from the sky for a while.

586
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:36,225
I think a couple weeks of R
and R will get you straight.

587
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,861
I understand, sir.

588
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:40,430
Also, nothing about
this little hike

589
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:42,766
of yours is going
to be reported,

590
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:45,535
provided it does
not happen again.

591
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:47,103
You understand?

592
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:49,205
Yes, sir, I understand.

593
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,140
[sighs]

594
00:28:51,182 --> 00:28:53,976
[people murmuring]

595
00:28:54,018 --> 00:28:57,280
What do you think the chances
are for my brother Joe, sir?

596
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:00,249
Well, Cole, some of the
guys have made it back

597
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,051
through the lines.

598
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:04,888
The resistance has been
a big help with that,

599
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,665
but I'm not gonna
bullshit you, Major.

600
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,268
The chances are not good.

601
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:14,230
Well, Joe could survive, sir,

602
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:17,742
if he made it to
the ground alive.

603
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,003
He could survive in the woods.

604
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:23,139
It's obvious to
me that you two

605
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:25,083
were pretty darn
close growing up.

606
00:29:26,886 --> 00:29:29,420
We did just about everything
together growing up.

607
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:34,217
Our Daddy died in the Great
War when we were young, sir.

608
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:35,685
Joe never met him.

609
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:37,653
He was a soldier?

610
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:40,089
[people murmuring]

611
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:43,192
Look, we don't have to talk
about this if you don't want to.

612
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:45,161
No, no, it's okay, sir.

613
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:46,864
He was a pilot too.

614
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:47,739
Really?

615
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:49,775
Yes, sir.

616
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:54,914
He was one of 20 shot down
by a young German ace.

617
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:58,007
You know, those German
planes could turn on a dime.

618
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,450
They were better than ours.

619
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:01,854
Wasn't the Red Baron, was it?

620
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:06,424
No, it wasn't
Baron von Richthofen.

621
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:09,252
But I did find out
who it was, sir.

622
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:11,554
You know how the army is,

623
00:30:11,596 --> 00:30:14,223
they don't like to tell you
anything unless they have to.

624
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:15,959
Well, ain't that
the damn truth?

625
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,702
No, sir, his name was Raiden.

626
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:24,001
R-A-I-D-E-N.

627
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:25,844
I don't know much
else other than

628
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,873
that he stayed
flying after the war.

629
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,475
Knowing you, I'm surprised
you didn't stow away

630
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:35,988
on some transatlantic ship
just to try and find the guy.

631
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,482
Well, it had
crossed my mind, sir.

632
00:30:39,524 --> 00:30:42,819
Anyway, during your time on
the ground I'd appreciate it

633
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:45,454
if you'd hang around the
rookie pilots a little bit,

634
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:47,732
you know, maybe give
them a few pointers.

635
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,970
Absolutely, sir, absolutely.

636
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,171
[Richards] All right, good.

637
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:57,567
[Von Falenburg] What are
you doing with my apparatus?!

638
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:59,335
I meant no harm.

639
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:02,672
It reminded me of the equipment
I used during the last war.

640
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,473
I was a communications officer.

641
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,510
[Von Falenburg] You know
this area is forbidden!

642
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,078
[Messner] Is there
a problem here?

643
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,057
Why was this Jew
meddling with my equipment?

644
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:15,593
Isaac, go back to your work.

645
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:22,734
I apologize.

646
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:26,471
Isaac has not been
himself today.

647
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:29,875
[panting]

648
00:31:35,713 --> 00:31:36,982
He must be disciplined.

649
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,250
It is not that simple.

650
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:43,421
His wife and sons are
laborers at this facility.

651
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,248
The officer in
charge has determined

652
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,018
that they are too
weak to continue,

653
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,822
so they are being sent back
to the Mittelbau-Dora camp.

654
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,290
Why is this a concern?

655
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:56,093
These Jews are not even human.

656
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:58,003
It is a concern of mine.

657
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:07,169
We need Issac to be productive.

658
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:10,373
This intrusion will
not happen again.

659
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:13,451
You will make sure
that it does not.

660
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,285
So, Captain, will I
be able to see my wife

661
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:25,263
and sons before they
are transported?

662
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,290
[Messner sighs]

663
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:29,126
[Messner] I'm
afraid I won't be able

664
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:30,359
to help you with that.

665
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,570
[moaning]

666
00:32:33,972 --> 00:32:35,364
[Isaac] Miriam.

667
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,575
Issac, compose yourself.

668
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:42,246
I need you to focus
on what I am saying.

669
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:45,341
The radio equipment
in the next room.

670
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,542
[Isaac] Ja.

671
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:48,821
Do you believe
you can operate it?

672
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:52,082
I am certain of it.

673
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:53,150
Good.

674
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:54,951
I must take leave of you now.

675
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:58,088
I am going to interrupt
Colonel Raiden's dinner.

676
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,057
Do I know of this man?

677
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,624
I don't think so.

678
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:04,903
He is one of the commanders
of the Me262 program.

679
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,031
Ah, ja, the jets.

680
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,699
I have heard of them.

681
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:12,069
Fascinating devices.

682
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:16,873
Yes, but the program is
having personnel issues.

683
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:20,209
What you are working on
is the wave of the future.

684
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:21,153
Remember that.

685
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:25,247
[knocking on door]

686
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:26,125
Come.

687
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:29,518
Ah, Captain Messner.

688
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,821
Colonel.

689
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:32,723
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

690
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:33,757
I was already finished.

691
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,665
No problem.

692
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:39,062
So what do I owe this
visit from the SS?

693
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,163
No trouble, I hope.

694
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,073
Not at all.

695
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:45,534
I just wanted to finally
meet the heroic war hero

696
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:47,037
everyone is talking about.

697
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:47,838
Oh, please.

698
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,072
Just following orders.

699
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:50,774
[Messner] Nonsense!

700
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:53,375
27 kills in two months.

701
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:56,113
And with the new jet
fighter, no less.

702
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:58,915
It is truly an
amazing aircraft.

703
00:33:58,957 --> 00:34:00,050
You should see her in action.

704
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:01,659
I would like to.

705
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:14,530
I imagine the
same as before, Rob.

706
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:15,664
Brandy?

707
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,176
You have an excellent
memory, Malcolm.

708
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:23,506
The intelligence
community does frown

709
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:27,409
upon those forgetful types,
if you know what I mean.

710
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:30,013
Do you miss your
offices at the RAF?

711
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:31,614
Oh, I suppose.

712
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:35,952
However, the man at the top
is not going anywhere soon.

713
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:40,623
So I thought it best for
me to make a lateral move.

714
00:34:40,665 --> 00:34:41,499
Cheers!

715
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:45,103
[clinking]

716
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:51,067
Rob, I know you are
an extremely busy man.

717
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:53,335
I do appreciate the visit,

718
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:56,681
but, what actually brings
you all the way out here?

719
00:34:58,116 --> 00:35:00,777
Malcolm, my boys are getting
spooked, just plain spooked,

720
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:02,378
by this German technology.

721
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,446
[Malcolm] You're
referring to the Me262.

722
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:06,016
And the rockets, the big ones.

723
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:07,449
Terrorist weapons.

724
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:11,387
Their sole purpose
is to spread fear

725
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:14,825
amongst a war-ravaged
civilian population

726
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:18,661
that has already endured and
suffered so so very much.

727
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:20,529
Yes, sir, you're
absolutely right, Malcolm.

728
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:21,965
But we're here now.

729
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:25,001
And we've got better bombers,
we got better ordinance,

730
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:28,171
we got better tactics than
we've ever had before.

731
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:29,572
But we need targets.

732
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:33,384
Precise targets are a
problem with the Me262.

733
00:35:34,652 --> 00:35:38,248
They're being assembled
in abandoned tunnels,

734
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,585
bombed-out cathedrals, even
in forests under the trees.

735
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:43,519
And the rockets?

736
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,197
A little tougher to hide.

737
00:35:46,298 --> 00:35:50,626
Ah, they require
very skilled assembly

738
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:52,804
and the fuel system
is quite volatile,

739
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:56,665
ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen.

740
00:35:56,707 --> 00:36:01,179
However, there is
one major facility

741
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:06,751
that assembles the Me262
and the V-2 rocket.

742
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,981
The Germans call
it The Kohnstein.

743
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:14,650
So, Colonel, tell me
about this amazing aircraft

744
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:16,261
I've heard so to much about.

745
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:21,490
You know, they are building
you up as the next Red Baron.

746
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:22,959
[chuckles]

747
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:25,070
Our propaganda office is
doing a fine job, aren't they?

748
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:30,233
I first entered our
squadron as night fighters

749
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,376
against the British.

750
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:34,570
That's why they are
mainly painted black,

751
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:38,341
which I hear strikes fear into
the heart of the Americans.

752
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:40,819
But how did you
achieve so many kills?

753
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:45,916
25 of the 27 were Mosquitos,

754
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,994
the twin-engine
workhorse of the RAF.

755
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:54,925
My jets have a top speed
that is 200 kilometers faster

756
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:55,901
than the Mosquitos.

757
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:58,804
They never knew what hit them.

758
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:02,698
The Kohnstein plant, I'm
sure it's been targeted

759
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,532
by your boys?

760
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:04,801
Of course.

761
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,602
We've bombed the
bloody hell out of it.

762
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:11,649
The problem is that it's
located in a former gypsum mine,

763
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:15,812
extraordinarily well-protected
by the Mother Earth herself.

764
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:17,847
So what kind of
targets can you give me?

765
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:19,783
Mobile airfields.

766
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:21,918
Our counterparts have
become quite adept

767
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,965
at moving major operations
in 12 to 18 hours time.

768
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,960
Right now I could give
you two, maybe three,

769
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:34,331
locations where
Me262's may be found.

770
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:35,799
Then how can you
give us locations

771
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:38,534
if they're moving
them around so fast?

772
00:37:38,576 --> 00:37:42,638
Our intelligence is
first-class, my dear Colonel.

773
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,707
First-class.

774
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:48,510
So, from one interested
party to another,

775
00:37:48,552 --> 00:37:50,313
perhaps you could tell to
me about this new rocket

776
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:51,555
I've been hearing about.

777
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,985
What have you heard?

778
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:56,953
That it may have
the capability

779
00:37:56,995 --> 00:38:00,689
to reach the east coast
of the United States.

780
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:05,736
Pure speculation, of course,
but I have seen the plans.

781
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:10,367
Such a weapon could secure
the future of the Third Reich?

782
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:14,570
Such a weapon, Herr
Colonel, could signal the rise

783
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,072
of the Fourth Reich.

784
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:18,274
Malcolm, I'm gonna take
whatever you can give me

785
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:19,809
on the airfields.

786
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:22,445
But this Kohnstein thing,
this really intrigues me.

787
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:24,389
Be patient with
that one, Colonel.

788
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:30,429
Sometimes terrible empires can
be brought down from within.

789
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:34,232
Malcolm, do you have
someone on the inside?

790
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,361
I'm afraid at this
time I'm not at liberty

791
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,595
to discuss that.

792
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:42,465
Colonel Raiden,
your enthusiasm

793
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:45,735
for the Me262 program
is appreciated,

794
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:50,782
but your squadron is down
to two now, I believe?

795
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,185
Good pilots are
hard to come by,

796
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:58,348
and I have to change airfield
locations, feels like daily.

797
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,616
Yet you have time
to visit us here.

798
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,018
Parts.

799
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,162
I have a critical shortage
of parts, Captain.

800
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:09,192
As a matter of fact, I
have to round up two trucks

801
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:11,027
and take parts to Frankfurt.

802
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:12,037
Frankfurt?

803
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:14,764
Unusual that they
would want to move you

804
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:16,733
to such a large city.

805
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:18,168
[Raiden] They wouldn't.

806
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,744
The field is an hour
south and further inland.

807
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:27,277
Reporting as ordered, sir.

808
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,912
Good evening, Major.

809
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:30,579
Finished torturing
rookies for the week?

810
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:31,815
[chuckling]

811
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:33,416
I just tell them
like it is, sir.

812
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,452
Yeah, well, we both know
it probably puts the fear

813
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:38,088
of God into them and that's
probably a good thing.

814
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,956
- Yes, sir.
- Here, take a seat.

815
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:41,491
[Cole] Thank you, sir.

816
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:44,202
Cole, we got some intel
you might be interested in.

817
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:46,595
I see you got a new map, sir.

818
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:47,831
Mm-hm.

819
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:49,999
Well, we found the
location of some

820
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,035
of those rocket planes
you encountered.

821
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:53,269
Hm.

822
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,038
Yes, we've located
a mobile airbase.

823
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,808
It's deep in Germany, about an
hour southwest of Frankfurt,

824
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:01,878
and our on-ground re-con
folks tell us there are two

825
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,613
or three of the
jets on the field.

826
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,915
They're made by Messerschmidt.

827
00:40:05,957 --> 00:40:07,325
The model number is 262.

828
00:40:08,894 --> 00:40:11,054
They've been giving
our boys quite a fit.

829
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,189
Are you sending
the 17's in, sir?

830
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:16,893
Major, it's a real hornet's
nest, and, at any given time,

831
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:18,428
there could be fighter squadrons

832
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,464
on this mobile
airbase, 109's, 190's.

833
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,133
We don't want to
tangle with those.

834
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:25,969
And the 262's might
be in bunkers.

835
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:28,338
What would you like
me to do about it, sir?

836
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,207
For one thing, you've been
out of the sky for 30 days,

837
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:33,642
and I know you're
itching to get back up.

838
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,145
Yes, sir, I am.

839
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:38,515
Tell me, Cole, when's the
last time you flew a Mustang?

840
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,816
It was about a year ago, sir.

841
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:41,251
But it wasn't one
of the new models.

842
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:44,387
The new models are
faster and carry more.

843
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:46,489
Still fly about the same.

844
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,691
I still like my old
crate, sir, the Gunfighter.

845
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:50,960
The Gunfighter.

846
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:52,996
Well, the Gunfighter's
still on the airfields.

847
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:54,272
Yours if you want it.

848
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:59,002
This is strictly
volunteer, of course.

849
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:02,472
If you don't want do it, I'll
still put you up in the sky.

850
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:05,808
But it's gonna have to be
in one of the newer B-17's.

851
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,944
That hole in the side
of your old ship,

852
00:41:07,986 --> 00:41:10,013
it put her out of
commission for a while.

853
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:12,415
Yes, sir, I saw her
down off the tarmac.

854
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:14,250
She looks kinda
lonely down there.

855
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,428
The other reason
is, I'm in a pickle.

856
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:19,322
The target is a mobile airfield,

857
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:21,933
and they can change
locations in six hours.

858
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:26,362
All of my P-51 pilots
are up on escort.

859
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:28,898
I'm not gonna send an
inexperienced pilot

860
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,433
on a mission like this.

861
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:32,235
I understand, sir.

862
00:41:32,277 --> 00:41:33,836
What are the particulars
of the mission?

863
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,872
Well, Major, it's
gonna be a daylight raid.

864
00:41:35,914 --> 00:41:37,706
There'll be two
fighters involved.

865
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,742
You'll be coming
in under the radar,

866
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:44,113
very low, very low over
some very rough terrain.

867
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,282
Sounds like a lotta fun, sir.

868
00:41:46,324 --> 00:41:47,584
Well, we're gonna need someone

869
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:50,353
to fly the other
plane, the P-38.

870
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:52,288
You got any suggestions?

871
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,790
[Cole] How about
Eddy, my co-pilot, sir?

872
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:55,225
He's ready for the 38.

873
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:57,160
Ah, a twin engine man.

874
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:58,194
[Cole] Yes, sir.

875
00:41:58,236 --> 00:41:59,862
Okay, get Eddy
in here tomorrow

876
00:41:59,904 --> 00:42:02,841
after breakfast first thing,
and we'll go over the plans.

877
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,337
Is there anything else, sir?

878
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:08,171
Anything else?

879
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:09,706
What do you mean?

880
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:10,506
Well, you said there was
two reasons you wanted me

881
00:42:10,548 --> 00:42:11,808
for this mission, sir.

882
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,951
Ah, yes.

883
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,679
Well, I don't want
you reading too much

884
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:18,548
into what I'm about to tell you.

885
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,382
[Cole] Is it about
my brother, sir?

886
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:20,216
No, no.

887
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:21,293
No, I wish.

888
00:42:22,494 --> 00:42:25,688
I did some research on
this Colonel Raiden,

889
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,357
this German ace Colonel Raiden.

890
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,558
Colonel Raiden, sir?

891
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,792
Really?

892
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:30,728
Well, you're right
about him staying

893
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,161
in the service after the war.

894
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:35,131
He's been part of the Luftwaffe
ever since its beginning.

895
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:37,934
In regards to this
airfield, your target,

896
00:42:37,976 --> 00:42:41,638
a Colonel Raiden comes into
play, we just don't know how.

897
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,209
Yeah, the ace from the previous
war, this Colonel Raiden,

898
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:49,212
was made the person
in charge of a portion

899
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:52,515
of this 262 program
back in 1942.

900
00:42:52,557 --> 00:42:56,052
And he convinced the Luftwaffe
brass to use the aircraft

901
00:42:56,094 --> 00:42:58,688
as a fighter, for
which it was designed.

902
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,791
You know, Hitler insist
on using it as a bomber.

903
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,293
- [chuckling]
- Yeah, go figure.

904
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:06,029
Anyway, I wouldn't get
your hopes up too high.

905
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:08,698
Your German ace just
might be at that airfield.

906
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,533
[dramatic music]

907
00:43:10,575 --> 00:43:11,367
Colonel?

908
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:13,036
[Richards] Yes, Cole?

909
00:43:13,078 --> 00:43:16,039
I'll take the assignment
on two conditions.

910
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:17,940
One is that I can
cut a savior pouch

911
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:19,242
into the backseat of my plane.

912
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:21,144
Hm, it's possible.

913
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:23,479
I'll have to get with
the mechanics on that.

914
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:25,381
Tell me, what's your
thinking behind this?

915
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:27,617
If Eddy doesn't make
it back in the 38,

916
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:30,386
it still gives us a chance to
get back to our lines, sir.

917
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:31,954
Keep in mind,
you're gonna be right

918
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,057
on the edge of effective range,

919
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:38,161
so if anyone uses the savior
pouch, it won't have a mask,

920
00:43:38,203 --> 00:43:40,798
so altitude will
be very limited.

921
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,031
Yes, sir, I understand that,

922
00:43:42,073 --> 00:43:44,100
but we're already gonna
be flying low anyway.

923
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:45,935
And I'd like to
arm the plane, sir.

924
00:43:45,977 --> 00:43:47,870
Well, I figured you would.

925
00:43:47,912 --> 00:43:51,082
[jeep engine humming]

926
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,213
[plane humming]

927
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:59,282
So how'd my name
come up for this?

928
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:00,950
I volunteered you.

929
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:02,820
So why'd you do that?

930
00:44:02,862 --> 00:44:04,887
Because you like flying
these P-38's so much.

931
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:06,456
Yeah, I like to fly them.

932
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:09,058
I don't particularly
want to die on one.

933
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,235
Look, you'll do fine.

934
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:13,529
I've never even come
close to being in combat

935
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:14,697
in one of those.

936
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:16,399
What if I get into a dogfight?

937
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:17,900
Look, we're not gonna
be flying high enough

938
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:20,303
to get into a
dogfight, so relax.

939
00:44:20,345 --> 00:44:23,072
Are you familiar with the
firepower on the 38 now?

940
00:44:23,114 --> 00:44:24,507
Gun cluster up front.

941
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:26,175
Easy to aim.

942
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:27,443
Now the 51 is different.

943
00:44:27,485 --> 00:44:29,780
Six MG's, three on either wing.

944
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:31,647
What happened to the cannon?

945
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:35,017
[Cole] The ammo was too
heavy, and it ran out too fast.

946
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:36,319
I liked the cannon.

947
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,562
Journey's End?

948
00:44:38,864 --> 00:44:40,590
Yeah, I like Journey's End.

949
00:44:40,632 --> 00:44:41,859
It's kind of poetic.

950
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:44,627
Yeah, well, poetic
if I make it back.

951
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:46,996
Otherwise pretty damn tragic.

952
00:44:47,038 --> 00:44:48,664
[plane humming]

953
00:44:48,706 --> 00:44:51,934
Eddy, no matter what happens,

954
00:44:51,976 --> 00:44:53,578
I'm not gonna leave
you behind, okay?

955
00:44:54,412 --> 00:44:55,246
Likewise.

956
00:44:56,414 --> 00:45:00,243
Gentlemen, the German
planes, mostly 190's,

957
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:02,412
are gonna be in
this area spread out

958
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:04,480
around the control station.

959
00:45:04,522 --> 00:45:06,582
Now, also we've been
told there may be

960
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,627
some anti-aircraft batteries
in the vicinity, of some kind.

961
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:13,055
We're not sure how many,
we're not sure of location,

962
00:45:13,097 --> 00:45:15,533
but that's the intelligence
we have at this time.

963
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:21,431
Our primary targets, the
Me262's, should be here.

964
00:45:21,473 --> 00:45:24,400
Now, they may be in protective
cover, it's hard to say.

965
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:27,503
Or you could get lucky and
they're out in the open,

966
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:30,348
either getting refueled
or waiting to take off.

967
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,608
The key is knocking out

968
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,912
those anti-aircraft
artillery guns first.

969
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:37,513
Yes, but you've got
to go in low and slow,

970
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:40,116
otherwise they're gonna
know you're coming.

971
00:45:40,158 --> 00:45:42,685
Now, that's the case, it
may be over pretty quick

972
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:43,561
for you two.

973
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:46,589
Look, Eddy, we're gonna
split and hit both sides

974
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:47,957
of the field simultaneously.

975
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,192
Yes, sir.

976
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:50,660
Yes, and after
you hit the guns,

977
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:53,864
regardless of your success,
you've got to drop your payload

978
00:45:53,906 --> 00:45:56,800
and make some great big
holes in the runway.

979
00:45:56,842 --> 00:46:00,036
Otherwise you're gonna have a
swarm of 190's up in the air

980
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:02,271
on your butts
within five minutes.

981
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:03,473
I'm not buying that, sir.

982
00:46:03,515 --> 00:46:04,942
[Richards] And
why do you say that?

983
00:46:04,984 --> 00:46:07,310
Because the 190 is a field
plane, sir, it's agile.

984
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:08,946
They'll scoot right
around those holes,

985
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:10,480
take off and come
right after us.

986
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:12,682
So they'll be on us like a
hound dog on a pork chop,

987
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:13,691
just like that.

988
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:16,118
Okay, I see your point.

989
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,653
So what do you suggest?

990
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:19,489
Okay, what I'm thinking
is forget the bombs, sir,

991
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:21,057
that's a one-shot deal.

992
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:23,025
What we do is, we split.

993
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:25,896
Eddy hits the anti-aircraft
and I hit the fuel trucks.

994
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:28,732
That way they stay on the
ground for the entire time.

995
00:46:28,774 --> 00:46:30,633
And think about it like
this: on our way back,

996
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:33,236
those bombs are gonna make the
difference between fuel, sir.

997
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:34,437
We might not make it back,

998
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:36,272
we'd have to splash
in the channel.

999
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:37,507
Okay.

1000
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:39,108
Eddy, are you okay
with that plan?

1001
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,244
I don't want a swarm
of 190's on my butt.

1002
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:44,389
If Cole's plan stops that
from happening, I'm good.

1003
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,751
Sir, we're gonna be light
on ammo on the way back.

1004
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:49,953
Can you tell us anything
about these jet planes

1005
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:52,622
in case one of them gets
up and starts chasing us?

1006
00:46:52,664 --> 00:46:55,157
Listen, let's pray
that doesn't happen.

1007
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:57,293
But if, and I say if it does,

1008
00:46:57,335 --> 00:46:59,930
just remember these
jets are faster

1009
00:46:59,972 --> 00:47:01,197
but they don't have the range

1010
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:03,466
or the maneuverability
that you have.

1011
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:06,536
So why are we doing
this as a daylight raid?

1012
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:09,205
Eddy, because most of the
planes on that airfield,

1013
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:12,876
including the 262's,
won't be there at night.

1014
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:14,043
Why?

1015
00:47:14,085 --> 00:47:14,978
Because they're gonna
be up in the sky

1016
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,755
hurting our British friends.

1017
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:22,285
I can hear the roar
of the engines now, sir.

1018
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,219
[plane humming]

1019
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:24,788
I don't like precision bombing,

1020
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,255
it's not easy with
these machines.

1021
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:29,091
That's why I'm a pilot,
not a bombardier!

1022
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:30,936
What's that, you get
some butterflies?

1023
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:34,063
Butterflies, maggots, worms.

1024
00:47:34,105 --> 00:47:35,732
All thanks to you.

1025
00:47:35,774 --> 00:47:36,666
Don't worry,
I'll be right there

1026
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,043
with you the whole way, okay?

1027
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,336
Let's get this
thing done, Major.

1028
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:41,504
Come on, let's go!

1029
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:44,315
[planes humming]

1030
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:11,676

1031

1032

[dramatic music]

1033

[planes humming]

1034
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:17,076
[dramatic music]

1035
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:54,637
Hello, Isaac.

1036
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,571
Herr Von Braun!

1037
00:49:55,613 --> 00:49:57,707
It is so good to see you!

1038
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:00,242
I had no notice of your arrival.

1039
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:04,313
Advanced communications
are not always best

1040
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:05,758
at this time, Isaac.

1041
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:08,085
I understand.

1042
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:10,053
So tell me, what is new?

1043
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:12,521
Well, for one thing, I noticed

1044
00:50:12,563 --> 00:50:15,959
that they have expanded
the trophy room.

1045
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:19,361
Someone has been doing
a lot of hunting here.

1046
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,664
Ja, that would be
General Stahkmann

1047
00:50:21,706 --> 00:50:24,835
and his officers from
the Mittelbau-Dora camp.

1048
00:50:24,877 --> 00:50:25,844
I see.

1049
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:29,148
Is that where you
are housed, Isaac?

1050
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:35,145
To them I am an important
part of the V-2 program.

1051
00:50:35,187 --> 00:50:36,121
Thanks to you.

1052
00:50:37,956 --> 00:50:41,617
However, my family has been
transferred back there.

1053
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:42,895
And I fear for them.

1054
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:48,591
I am not familiar with the
reputation of that facility.

1055
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:53,230
It is notorious for
illness, beatings,

1056
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:55,966
and intolerable
working conditions.

1057
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:58,969
Unfortunately that
appears to be the norm

1058
00:50:59,011 --> 00:51:00,444
for all of these camps.

1059
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:06,517
Isaac, the V-2 program is a
success, thanks to my work,

1060
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:09,880
and, of course, thanks to you.

1061
00:51:09,922 --> 00:51:13,158
So tell me, how do
you define success?

1062
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,687
Do you remember our days back
in Berlin at the Technicia?

1063
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:23,734
Yes, I believe you
and I met in '31.

1064
00:51:24,468 --> 00:51:25,771
Something like that.

1065
00:51:26,772 --> 00:51:29,465
I was so young!

1066
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:31,676
And my hair was
so much darker.

1067
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:35,371
- [dramatic music]
- We talked so much

1068
00:51:35,413 --> 00:51:38,549
about space travel with
the rockets we would build.

1069
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:42,746
We had such dreams
for the future.

1070
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:45,991
Ja, so many dreams.

1071
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,996
The rockets that hit
London worked perfectly,

1072
00:51:52,396 --> 00:51:55,591
except that they landed
on the wrong planet!

1073
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:58,594
[Isaac laughs]

1074
00:51:58,636 --> 00:52:02,833
I overheard someone refer
to you as Professor Von Braun.

1075
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:04,201
Is this correct?

1076
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:07,369
It is correct,
but it is old news.

1077
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:09,973
You must tell
me what happened.

1078
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:13,709
When the V-2 was
still the A-4 program,

1079
00:52:13,751 --> 00:52:17,646
the Fuhrer was thrilled when
he saw a film we had made

1080
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:21,450
of a successful
launch, so much so

1081
00:52:21,492 --> 00:52:26,497
that he personally insisted I
be awarded Professor status.

1082
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:29,793
Good for you, Wehrner.

1083
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:33,029
I am glad to see you
are on their good side.

1084
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:34,907
Well, I don't know.

1085
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:40,145
You know, sometimes I'm not
afraid to speak my mind.

1086
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:44,373
I remember that got you
into some trouble at school.

1087
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:48,245
The professors would discuss
your perceived arrogance

1088
00:52:48,287 --> 00:52:50,180
in the faculty lounge.

1089
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:52,749
In February I was summoned

1090
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:55,651
to Himmler's
headquarters in Prussia.

1091
00:52:55,693 --> 00:52:58,121
He was trying to
take control of all

1092
00:52:58,163 --> 00:53:01,699
of the armaments programs,
including the V-2.

1093
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:06,129
Himmler and I did not
particularly get along.

1094
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:08,365
Mostly because I
did not want to work

1095
00:53:08,407 --> 00:53:12,068
with the people he
wanted me to work with.

1096
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,004
They were not good people?

1097
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:17,548
It's just that they
weren't brilliant like you.

1098
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:23,079
So, late last year
an engineer friend

1099
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:26,116
and I visited a dentist.

1100
00:53:26,158 --> 00:53:31,163
This was a lady dentist who I
found out later was an SS spy.

1101
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:36,860
She overheard us talking
about the rocket program,

1102
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:41,907
how space travel is the reason
for our work, not warfare.

1103
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:44,768
We may have also said something

1104
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:49,072
about the war effort not
going well for Germany.

1105
00:53:49,114 --> 00:53:51,707
[Isaac sighs]

1106
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:55,145
These remarks were,
of course, reported,

1107
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:58,214
and I was detained in
March by the Gestapo.

1108
00:53:58,256 --> 00:54:01,418
I was a guest of
theirs for two weeks

1109
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,387
in one of their cells
in western Poland.

1110
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:07,523
I assume it was
not a posh resort.

1111
00:54:07,565 --> 00:54:11,294
It was isolation in a dungeon.

1112
00:54:11,336 --> 00:54:15,207
I truly did not think I
would make it out alive.

1113
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:20,203
But I was released
when it was discovered

1114
00:54:20,245 --> 00:54:24,941
that they could not continue
the V-2 program without me.

1115
00:54:24,983 --> 00:54:28,286
So, now you too must
look over your shoulder.

1116
00:54:30,922 --> 00:54:35,260
Isaac, believe
me, no one is safe.

1117
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:41,033
[dramatic music]

1118
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:18,094
I will not spend another night

1119
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:19,637
with these jets on the ground!

1120
00:55:21,373 --> 00:55:23,942
We have fueled the
262s except for yours.

1121
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:27,212
And why isn't my
jet being refueled?

1122
00:55:32,317 --> 00:55:34,710
Well, sir, it is
the coupling, Colonel.

1123
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:36,112
What coupling?

1124
00:55:36,154 --> 00:55:38,515
The coupling that
malfunctioned was replaced,

1125
00:55:38,557 --> 00:55:39,925
but the replacement failed.

1126
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,220
How am I supposed to fly
without fuel and parts?!

1127
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:47,032
[dramatic music]

1128
00:56:11,722 --> 00:56:13,325
[Eddy] Battery first.

1129
00:56:14,893 --> 00:56:16,061
Battery first.

1130
00:56:17,028 --> 00:56:19,764
[dramatic music]

1131
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:29,673
Come on Eddy,
where's the battery?

1132
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:36,940
There is no battery.

1133
00:56:36,982 --> 00:56:39,818
Eddy, if they're
there, take them out.

1134
00:56:42,354 --> 00:56:45,023
[plane humming]

1135
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:48,585
Check the horizon!

1136
00:56:48,627 --> 00:56:50,120
Check the horizon!

1137
00:56:50,162 --> 00:56:52,989
[plane humming]

1138
00:56:53,031 --> 00:56:53,865
Alarm!

1139
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:56,526
[guns firing]

1140
00:56:56,568 --> 00:56:57,668
Take cover!

1141
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:03,741
[guns firing]

1142
00:57:19,224 --> 00:57:20,316
Shoot the twin-engine!

1143
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:23,119
[guns firing]
Shoot the twin-engine!

1144
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,722
[plane explodes]
[dramatic music]

1145
00:57:25,764 --> 00:57:27,223
[Cole] That's
the way it's done!

1146
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:29,526
I'll take center from here.

1147
00:57:29,568 --> 00:57:31,294
[dramatic music]
[guns firing]

1148
00:57:31,336 --> 00:57:34,072

[dramatic music]

1150
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:42,605
Only a guess, but I think
they just got refueled.

1151
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:45,150
[guns firing]

1152
00:57:47,485 --> 00:57:49,821
[Eddy] Taking fire, Major.

1153
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,249
[dramatic music]

1154
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,418
[guns firing]

1155
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,686
[Cole] All right.

1156
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:59,289
One pass.

1157
00:57:59,331 --> 00:58:01,824
Surround them with your gun.

1158
00:58:01,866 --> 00:58:04,369
[guns firing]

1159
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:06,429
[Eddy] Ammo's
gonna dry up quick

1160
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:08,965
if we keep up this turkey shoot.

1161
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:10,600

1163
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:15,805
Major.

1164
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:18,474
Major, I got a problem here.

1165
00:58:18,516 --> 00:58:19,776
[Cole] Yeah, I see.

1166
00:58:19,818 --> 00:58:22,745
[plane humming]

1167
00:58:22,787 --> 00:58:24,055
Come with me.

1168
00:58:26,224 --> 00:58:28,885
[Cole] Go out the
same way you came in.

1169
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:31,696
[planes humming]

1170
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:36,434
Get a few miles out and then
take her down in a field.

1171
00:58:38,303 --> 00:58:40,038
Keep that Tommy Gun close.

1172
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:43,900
[plane humming]

1173
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:46,636
They won't be expecting that.

1174
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:48,847
I'll pick you up
in a few minutes.

1175
00:58:49,714 --> 00:58:50,940
[Eddy] Where are you going?

1176
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:52,942
[Cole] I'm gonna
make another pass.

1177
00:58:52,984 --> 00:58:55,445
Looks like they still have
planes they can fly out of here.

1178
00:58:55,487 --> 00:58:57,180
We can't have that.

1179
00:58:57,222 --> 00:59:00,149
[Eddy] Okay, Major,
I'm counting on you.

1180
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:02,961

1191
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:05,114
How bad are you hit, boy?

1192
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:06,649
[Eddy] It hurts
like hell, Major.

1193
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:09,319
I want to see what
we are up against.

1194
01:00:09,361 --> 01:00:12,297
These men possess
unimaginable courage.

1195
01:00:13,365 --> 01:00:14,824
They are the enemy, sir.

1196
01:00:14,866 --> 01:00:16,626
They are pilots.

1197
01:00:16,668 --> 01:00:18,461
With a squadron of these men,

1198
01:00:18,503 --> 01:00:20,305
I could turn the
outcome of the war.

1199
01:00:21,406 --> 01:00:23,399
Well, it ain't
supposed to feel good.

1200
01:00:23,441 --> 01:00:24,667
[Eddy groans]

1201
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:26,336
It feels like it just
went straight through.

1202
01:00:26,378 --> 01:00:28,538
All right, listen, just keep
some pressure on it, all right?

1203
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,749
Hold right there, we'll
get you to the aircraft.

Come on, Eddy, this
ain't gonna be easy!

1207
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:42,852
Beats walking home, skipper.

1208
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:43,695
Come on!

1209
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:48,199
What kind of
fresh hell is this?

1210
01:00:51,636 --> 01:00:52,895
Great.

1211
01:00:52,937 --> 01:00:54,672
Now you got me in a pine box.

1212
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:58,000
[Cole] Colonel Raiden!

1213
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:00,738
[dramatic music]

1214
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,473
Do you know this man, sir?

1215
01:01:03,515 --> 01:01:04,607
No.

1216
01:01:04,649 --> 01:01:07,385
[dramatic music]

1217
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,581
Ah, it is personal
with this American.

1218
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:14,092
My father sends his regards.

01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:40,418
I don't think
anything will fly here.

1223
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:45,615
Yes, sir.

1224
01:01:45,657 --> 01:01:47,116
Here's what I want you to do.

1225
01:01:47,158 --> 01:01:49,986
Get my jet ready and make
sure it's fully armed.

1226
01:01:50,028 --> 01:01:51,354
[fire crackling]

1227
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:52,823
Sir, need I remind you,

1228
01:01:52,865 --> 01:01:55,133
you're plane was not fueled
up before the attack.

1229
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,728
I am aware of that.

to see you.

1281
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:06,482
He needs a full debrief on this.

[Cole] Yes, sir, no problem.

Oh, and by the way,
your brother's back.

He's, uh...

1295
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:29,180
Well, I saw him over there,
he was over with the others.

1296
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:31,116
Okay.

01:05:32,684 --> 01:05:35,112

Colonel Richards needs to see you,

- he needs a full debriefing.
- Yes, sir.

Phillips?

01:05:52,537 --> 01:05:53,462
No?

1309
01:05:53,504 --> 01:05:54,765

- Tell me what happened.
- I will, I will.

Ah, he's not good, not good.

01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,026
I'm gonna go check
on him in a few.

1325
01:06:23,068 --> 01:06:25,962
Yeah, I wish I could tell
your wife and kids about this.

1326
01:06:26,004 --> 01:06:27,097
They'll know soon enough.

Telegraphs go fast.

1328
01:06:35,246 --> 01:06:37,206
He made it back, Lillian.

1329
01:06:37,248 --> 01:06:38,316
Joe made it back.

1330
01:06:42,353 --> 01:06:43,412
He made it back.

1331
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:45,082
My Daddy's coming home!

1332
01:06:45,124 --> 01:06:46,591
Yes, he is, sweetheart.

1333
01:06:48,026 --> 01:06:48,927
Yes, he is.

1334
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,760
[Wilkins] Rob, I took the
liberty of pouring you a brandy.

1335
01:06:56,802 --> 01:06:58,195
I hope you don't mind.

1336
01:06:58,237 --> 01:06:59,730
Thank you very much,
Malcolm, I appreciate that.

1337
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:01,497
They said your phone
call sounded urgent.

1338
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:04,067
I got over here as
quickly as I could.

1339
01:07:04,109 --> 01:07:06,203
I heard about the
pain that a couple

1340
01:07:06,245 --> 01:07:09,940
of your boys put forth
on that German airfield

1341
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,674
that we talked
about a while back.

1342
01:07:11,716 --> 01:07:14,443
Yeah, Malcolm, it
was one hell of a raid.

1343
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:16,980
And we couldn't have done it,
though, without your help.

1344
01:07:17,022 --> 01:07:19,883
I trust both pilots
returned safely.

1345
01:07:19,925 --> 01:07:21,250
One of them took
a pretty bad hit,

1346
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:23,352
but he's pulling through.

1347
01:07:23,394 --> 01:07:25,088
Good for him, good for him.

1348
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,157
Young man's been
given a ticket home.

1349
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:28,624
I'm not so sure.

1350
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,894
He may still have some piss
and vinegar left in him.

1351
01:07:30,936 --> 01:07:33,096
But tell me about the Kohnstein.

1352
01:07:33,138 --> 01:07:34,798
What's with the Kohnstein plant?

1353
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,133
It seems that the Germans

1354
01:07:36,175 --> 01:07:37,934
have more tricks
up their sleeves.

1355
01:07:37,976 --> 01:07:40,503
What do you mean,
beyond the V-2 rocket?

1356
01:07:40,545 --> 01:07:41,403
There's more?

1357
01:07:41,445 --> 01:07:42,605
[Wilkins chuckles]

1358
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:45,742
In the deranged
mind of Adolf Hitler,

1359
01:07:45,784 --> 01:07:50,379
the V-2 rocket is considered
a retribution weapon,

1360
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:52,690
or a vengeance weapon,
hence the letter V.

1361
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:57,120
He considers this payback
on us English people

1362
01:07:57,162 --> 01:07:59,022
for all of our bombing raids.

1363
01:07:59,064 --> 01:08:02,993
It doesn't seem to matter
to that bloody bastard

1364
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:05,427
that they bombed
us to start with.

1365
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:07,964
Well, Malcolm, you know
what they say, "All's fair...

1366
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:10,441
"In love and war," yes, yes.

1367
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:16,514
The Kohnstein is still the
primary manufacturing facility

1368
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:18,942
for the Me262.

1369
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:22,946
It's also the primary
manufacturing facility

1370
01:08:22,988 --> 01:08:27,150
for the V-2 rocket, and
it's also home of research

1371
01:08:27,192 --> 01:08:29,585
and development
for a new project.

1372
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:32,588
Is that using the
same V-2 technology?

1373
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,958
Pretty much, just much larger.

1374
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,495
The goal of this
is to hit targets

1375
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:42,573
on the east coast of
the United States.

1376
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:46,368
Do you actually believe
they can do that, Malcolm?

1377
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:47,771
Had I not thought
they could do it,

1378
01:08:47,813 --> 01:08:49,214
I would not have called you.

1379
01:08:50,349 --> 01:08:53,810
They're building a
prototype as we speak.

1380
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:56,387
This war needs to end.

1381
01:08:57,555 --> 01:09:01,985
Whatever we have to do,
we need to stop them.

1382
01:09:02,027 --> 01:09:04,196
This war must end.

1383
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,601
[dramatic music]

1384
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:14,197
Frauline von
Falenburg, I apologize

1385
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:16,266
that I am just now
able to entertain you

1386
01:09:16,308 --> 01:09:17,868
with a proper dinner.

1387
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:22,504
I hope your stay here so far
has not been too terrible.

1388
01:09:22,546 --> 01:09:24,174
No apologies needed.

1389
01:09:24,216 --> 01:09:27,676
Thank you for taking the time
out of your schedule for this.

1390
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:30,814
Hopefully, conditions in
Berlin will improve soon

1391
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:32,514
and you can return home.

1392
01:09:32,556 --> 01:09:34,851
The most important
thing is that I am able

1393
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:37,620
to continue my support
of the war effort.

1394
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:40,689
Germany must be victorious.

1395
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:42,167
I completely agree.

1396
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:45,262
I have heard many
of your broadcasts,

1397
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:48,064
so I'm very familiar
with your persona.

1398
01:09:48,106 --> 01:09:50,967
However, I know very
little about you.

1399
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:53,803
Tell me, Frauline, what
are you planning on doing

1400
01:09:53,845 --> 01:09:54,846
after the war?

1401
01:09:57,049 --> 01:10:00,751
You mean, after the triumph
of the Third Reich, general?

1402
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,380
Of course, Frauline.

1403
01:10:03,422 --> 01:10:04,957
That's exactly what I mean.

1404
01:10:06,124 --> 01:10:09,119
I will do everything
in my power to make sure

1405
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:11,553
that Germany is
the greatest empire

1406
01:10:11,595 --> 01:10:14,257
in the history of the world.

1407
01:10:14,299 --> 01:10:16,092
There are those who forget

1408
01:10:16,134 --> 01:10:18,937
that conquest can
be very difficult.

1409
01:10:20,839 --> 01:10:24,034
General, when I
see what we have done

1410
01:10:24,076 --> 01:10:27,469
in the last five years,
I can only imagine

1411
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:31,074
what we can accomplish
in the next 20 years,

1412
01:10:31,116 --> 01:10:34,443
50 years, even 500 years.

1413
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:36,846
Food for thought, Frauline.

1414
01:10:36,888 --> 01:10:39,182
We must do this again sometime.

1415
01:10:39,224 --> 01:10:41,525
It would be my
pleasure, general.

1416
01:10:44,429 --> 01:10:47,132
[dramatic music]

1417
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:01,004
Is this everything on the V-3?

1418
01:11:01,046 --> 01:11:03,440
Everything that I am
responsible for, yes.

1419
01:11:03,482 --> 01:11:05,909
Do you really think that
this propulsion system

1420
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:09,678
could take a rocket that is
larger than the V-2 all the way

1421
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,315
to the east coast of
the United States?

1422
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:14,326
[Isaac] I'm absolutely
certain of it.

1423
01:11:15,327 --> 01:11:17,320
All right, Isaac.

1424
01:11:17,362 --> 01:11:18,864
This is what I need you to do.

1425
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:23,927
Go through all of your
plans and equations

1426
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:25,203
and make them unworkable.

1427
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:28,264
What?

1428
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:30,967
But do not make it obvious
that you are doing this.

1429
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:35,372
- Captain, are you a...
- Mr. Abromowicz,

1430
01:11:35,414 --> 01:11:37,349
I believe you are
a very clever man.

1431
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:41,719
What is the mission, Captain?

1432
01:11:43,288 --> 01:11:45,791
The mission is the
destruction of this facility.

1433
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,919
Can you verify that
my family is safe

1434
01:11:49,961 --> 01:11:51,463
and has been moved from here?

1435
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,790
They have been relocated.

1436
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,534
I put them on the train myself.

1437
01:11:57,402 --> 01:11:58,194
Very well.

1438
01:11:58,236 --> 01:11:59,304
Then I agree.

1439
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:03,008
I need you to use the radio
equipment in the next room.

1440
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:05,835
I need you to broadcast
a short message

1441
01:12:05,877 --> 01:12:08,471
at a very specific time.

1442
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:09,973
Is this possible?

1443
01:12:10,015 --> 01:12:13,552
Yes, if her majesty Frau
Falenburg isn't around.

1444
01:12:14,652 --> 01:12:16,321
I'll see to it
that she is occupied.

1445
01:12:17,456 --> 01:12:20,817
Isaac, this will be
needed when the Me262's

1446
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,485
and rockets are being removed

1447
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,487
from this facility in two days.

1448
01:12:24,529 --> 01:12:26,298
What is the message?

1449
01:12:27,165 --> 01:12:28,433
It is, [clears throat],

1450
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:32,062
"Now is the time
for all good men

1451
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:34,605
"to come to the aid
of their country."

1452
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,000
Repeated twice.

1453
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:40,779
Captain, you make a
very convincing American.

1454
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,350
Or, I make a very
convincing German.

1455
01:12:57,863 --> 01:13:00,499
[dramatic music]

1456
01:13:11,776 --> 01:13:14,513
[dramatic music]

1457
01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:51,338
