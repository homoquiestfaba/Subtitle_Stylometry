How could l not get that one?

l think this was my personal best.

48

l don't ever remember
doing this well before.

49
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,616
This was definitely a better run
than my Debbie Reynolds one.

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,201
Debbie Reynolds one?

51
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,371
Now we gotta go back and count.
l gotta count all the stars again.

52
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,041
l can't believe you did this to me.
l can't believe you did it.

53
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,545
Come on. Let's go. We're to count them.

You don't remember where l started at all?

Think. Maybe if you see it. Three.

57

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,639
How many did we just do?

One, two, three, four, five.

61
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,855
Here we go.

Very, very good. Very compelling.

64
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:20,116
Catches your eye, don't you think?

65
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,410
Don't forget, this is a big traffic flow area.

66
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,954

67

Big traffic flow.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,708
You look good. Very, very good.

69
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,877
Very, very compelling.

70
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,757
Sometimes you just got
to invest in your future, you know.

71
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,135
You got to step up and invest.

72
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,766
They did a beautiful job with the artwork.
lt really catches your eye.

73
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,685
Definitely worth the money.

74
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,652
l should probably have a fax or two waiting
by the time we get home, right?

75
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,195
What do you think?

76
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,488

No. No, it's not yours.

80
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,139
Hi. This is Jimmy Alto, actor extraordinaire.

81
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,934
l'm gonna have to get back to you.
l have a very busy schedule.

82
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,268
l'm on the set right now,

83
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,604

or a fax for me. Thanks.

84
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,982
-Favorite movie?

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,402
1 939, Selznick lnternational.

86
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,238
First movie you ever saw?

87
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,699
-The Mummy.
-Boris Karloff.

88
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,286
l was a young kid with my dad.
l wasn't feeling well.

89
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,373
My dad let me stay up
and watch Fright Night.

90
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,876
You know what l could
never figure out about the mummy?

91
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,254
The mummy used to walk with one
arm out and a leg dragging behind.

92
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,799
He was still always able to get his victim.

93
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,093
l'm thinking as a kid, "l'm pretty fast.

94
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,136
"Just put some moves on the mummy,

95
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,138
"and the mummy would never get me."

96
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,057
This is what you're thinking about?

97
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,686
Then l realize the mummy
never has to sleep.

98
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,606
Eventually, l'd get tired
of running around the mummy.

99
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,984
That's when he'd get me.

100
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,027
So what did you do?
Scare yourself to death

101
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,195
thinking you were going to sleep

102
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,989
and the mummy
was coming in your room at night?

103
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,700
This schmuck, this mummy is in Cairo.

104
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,744
He's got to take a plane
from Egypt to Philadelphia.

105
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,706
This mummy has got to get a passport,

106
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,874
and you're worried
he's coming in your room at night?

107
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,253
This mummy's got
more important things on its mind.

108
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,964
You know what l could
never figure out about the mummy

109
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,882
was how he used to walk around
with one arm out

110
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,759
-and a leg dragging behind him.
-William.

111
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,970
William, you're blanking.

112
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,681
Did l say that?

113
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,099
Trust me.

114
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,476
l did say that.

115
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,437
Watch the radio.

116
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,772
l got to go to the bathroom.

117
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,165
You see this?

118
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,916
We're going to make a withdrawal.

119
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,003
Oh, God. Of all the people,
you have to pick on me?

120
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,504
l make very little money.

121
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,256
Two hundred's not going to kill you.
Just hurry up.

122
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,716
Two hundred?

123
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,677
l never use these machines at night.

124
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,262
l'm always afraid.

125
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,764
Just shut up and get on with it.

126
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,390
l'm wrong. "Enter again."

127
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,600
Lady, don't provoke me!

128
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,102
Don't touch my back, please.
You make me nervous.

129
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,854
Don't provoke me. Just give me the money!

130
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,981
Wait, wait. "Processing."

131
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,903
"No funds?"

132
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,447
-What do you mean?
-l can't believe it!

133
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,158
l don't have any money in my account.

134
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,577
-All right, give me your purse.
-l don't have any money, man.

135
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,370
l don't have anything.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,918
Pick it up. Pick it up!

137
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,337
No. lf l do, then you'll hit me in the head.

138
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,297
Take what you want. l don't have anything.

139
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,883
Put your hands down.
Put your hands down.

140
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,552
Okay, pick up the car keys.

141
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,180
Go ahead. Pick up the car keys.

142
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,642
Where's your car?

143
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,268
lt's the blue Mazda.

144
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,603
-Okay, come on.
-Okay, no, listen,

145
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,439
-if you want the car, you have the car.
-No, no, no. Understand? Gun.

146
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,857
-Do you speak English? Okay.
-Yes, yes, yes.

147
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,901
-l want you to get into the car...
-No, no.

148
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,695
Listen to me.
lf you want the car, just take it.

149
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,739
-l won't say anything.
-l just want you to get into the car.

150
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,117
-l don't want to get into an argument!
-Don't touch me!

151
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,953
lf you want the car, you have the car!
Take it!

152
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,123
Oh, shit.

153
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,542
Would you put your fucking hands...

154
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,808
You get up, you big tub of guts.

155
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,400
Jimmy.

156
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,735
-Jimmy.
-Hey.

157
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:09,280
Some guy just held me up
at the ready teller.

158
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,990
-What?
-He had a gun in my back.

159
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,617
-He wanted $200.
-The lowlife scum.

160
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,787
What the fuck
is going on in this world today?

161
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,916
Will somebody tell me what kind of
sick world this is we live in?

162
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,418
Tell me what happened.

163
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,794
Don't leave anything out.

164
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,173
l couldn't get money from the machine.
l didn't have any.

165
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,800
-He wanted me to get in the car.
-Don't tell me you got in the car.

166
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,343
-You didn't get in the car?
-No.

167
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,762
l threw the keys away, and he ran off.

168
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,640
Lowlife scum. Scum of the earth.

169
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,517
l'll tell you,
it was smart not to get in the car.

170
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,894
l knew l wasn't going to get into the car.

171
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,021
Definitely smart not to get in the car.

172
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,647
-What did he get?
-He didn't get anything.

173
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,858
l didn't have any money in my account.

174
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,613
Honey, l'm sorry.

175
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,947
l'm sorry.

176
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,490
Don't worry.

177
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,454
lt's a good thing l took that money.

178
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,248
-You took the money?
-Yeah. Definitely the right move.

179
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,000
You mean you took my money?

180
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,002
What the hell is wrong with you?

181
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,420
l borrowed the card.

182
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,381
l had a crisis
with my bus bench advertisement.

183
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,966
What are you talking about?

184
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,927
l have a bus bench on Sunset

185
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,846
right near the gates of Bel Air,
big traffic flow area.

186
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,474
They're looking for an actor,
boom, they see me.

187
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,309
Jimmy, you stole my money.

188
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,938
"Stole" is a harsh word, honey.
l used it as an investment in us.

189
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,273
ln us? ln you, not in us!

190
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,651
The phone could ring any moment.
That could be the call.

191
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,277
Next thing you know, l'm in a series.

192
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,112
Then we're living on the Westside.

193
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,448
Bam! lt happens just like that.
We're on our way.

194
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,244
You don't have that bullshit job anymore.
Boom! We're on our way.

195
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,996
You took my money.
How could you take my money like that?

196
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,206
You know how strong l am as an actor.

197
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,416
l'm bound to be recognized.

198
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,418
You really are a sick nut, you know that?

199
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,628
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

200
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,505
"Ring, ring." Any moment.

201
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,590
Boom, we're on our way.

202
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,719
That money sits there at the gates of
Bel Air right now, gathering momentum!

203
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,056
lt was a good thing,
and you should thank your lucky stars

204
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,934
that l got that money out
before that scumbag did.

205
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:06,105
How many times have l told you
not to go in my purse?

206
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,774
Don't ever go into my purse again.

207
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,025
Ever!

208
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,112
Kid...

209
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,950
I think it'd be a good idea
if you'd hand over your gun.

210
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,584
You want to look for this guy?
You think you could recognize him?

211
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,836
What?

212
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,798
l say you think you could recognize him?
l want to look for this guy.

213
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,135
l'll kill the motherfucker
if l find him, trying to take your money.

214
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,512
Please just spare me this, will you?

215
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,931
Why? You think l'm kidding? Huh?

216
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,225
You think l'm fooling around?

217
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,019
Yeah? l'm fooling around?

218
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,147
See this? l find him, l'll put him away.

219
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,941
-What are you doing with a gun?
-Lowlife scum.

220
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,610
Jesus Christ!

221
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,945
Are you crazy?

222
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,447
Blanks.

223
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,907
William gave me the gun and the blanks.

224
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,578
That's a smart idea. A gun with blanks.

225
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,372
lt's all an illusion. That's all it is.

226
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,833
Put that away, please.
You make me nervous with that thing.

227
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,460
That's the whole point.

228
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,503
That's the whole point.
That's the point l'm trying to make.

229
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,088
You made it for me.

230
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,427
lt frightens you. See?

231
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,430
A guy terrified you today with a gun.
lt's terrible.

232
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,224
lt was terrifying, right?
A guy pulled a gun on you.

233
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,187
That's why l want to get him.
l mean, you know, it shouldn't be.

234
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,272
-You still scared? You all right?
-Yeah.

235
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,107
Be careful with my heart.

236
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,277
-Huh?
-Be careful with my heart.

237
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,947
Self-promotion.

238
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,949
That's what it's about.

239
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,452
You can't rely on agents.

240
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,663
Do it yourself. That's what l say.

241
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,209
You'll see, those calls
are going to start coming in.

242
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,127
You can bank on it.

243
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,298
Then, with the contacts l make,

244
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,093
you become

245
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,512
Lorraine De la Pena,

246
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,515
haircutter to the stars.

247
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,108
Yeah, but in the meantime,
are you going to get a job, Jimmy?

248
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,860
-l'm working on it. l'm working on it.
-Okay.

249
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,742
-You're handsome.
-Yeah? Well, you know what they say.

250
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,829
The camera can only photograph
what it sees.

251
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,416
Not bad.

252
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,831
-What you doing out here, man?
-Hey. Jimmy Alto. Mr. Meyerhoff sent me.

253
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,791
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. Come on in.

254
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,627
l been out there since 6:30.
What time you open?

255
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,670
6:30.

256
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,717
You ought to get the coffee going
'cause about 7:00, they're gonna be in here.

257
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,801
Right.

258
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,386
You know how to
work one of these things, right?

259
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,389
-Yeah, sure.
-All right. Cool. Go on to it, then.

260
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,894
-So, Mr. M tell me you an actor, huh?
-Right.

261
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,812
Yeah. l seen you in anything?

262
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,732
You ever see that show Matlock,
the role of Cliff?

263
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,066
You was on that show?

264
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,235
No. l was up for the role of Cliff.

265
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,155
-You was up for the role?
-Yeah, l was up for the role.

266
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,907
Let me tell you something
about this business, okay?

267
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,492
Between you and me, and it goes no further.

268
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,826
No problem.

269
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,661
l gave a hell of a reading for that part,

270
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,748
but l think they felt
l was a little too strong for Andy Griffith.

271
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,041
Really?

272
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,085
l blew Andy Griffith off the screen.

273
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,421
l mean that's how strong l am.
You understand?

274
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,382
l mean, l know this guy. l had that part, too.

275
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,177
But, you know,
there's a lot of politics involved...

276
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,347
-Yeah, lots of it.
-...and not necessarily how good you are.

277
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,973
And l'm a little intimidating, you know?

278
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,809
-l'm so strong, l intimidate other actors.
-Well, you know, man,

279
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,770
l just thought
they wanted to get the best actor.

280
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,688
You know, that's what l thought.

281
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,774
lt's not always about talent.

282
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,108
l hear that.

283
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,653
So, man,
you know what you're doing here, right?

284
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,613
-Stack up about a half dozen of these.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,114
You good to go, right?
You know how to do this, right?

286
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,699
l did this in a Broadway show.

287
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,619
-You was on Broadway, man?
-Well, off-Broadway.

288
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,120
Off-Broadway?

289
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,623
Off-off-Broadway, but they're all the same.

290
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,708
-People don't understand.
-l hear you. l hear you.

291
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,294
Well, you know what?
l'm going to go off-off-Broadway.

292
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,713
-Let's get this cooking started. All right?
-All right.

293
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,131
-You good to go, right?
-l got it.

294
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,299
All right.

295
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,976
l think there's something wrong
with the button.

296
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,104
Well, why don't you try
the off-off-Broadway button?

297
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,736
l'd like a half a cup of coffee.

298
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,637
l only wanted half a cup of coffee.

299
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,020
l'm thinking of putting together
a one-man show.

300
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,272
-Tour de force kind of thing.
-Yeah.

301
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,275
That way you don't have some other
actors dragging you down, you know?

302
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,027
A one-man show, that's the way to go.

303
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,155
l got to find some piece
that really shows my...

304
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,866
My... l don't know, l can't find the words.

305
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,702
Like homeboy with the big mustache?

306
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,288
You know, the Huckleberry Finn dude?
What his name?

307
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,539
-Mark Twain?
-Yeah, yeah.

308
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,875
l could do Mark Twain. l could do that.

309
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,377
But l need something
that stretches me more, you know.

310
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,379
Something that really challenges me.

311
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,049
Something that'll show off
my talents and my abilities.

312
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:11,053
Yeah, well, why don't you show your
talents and abilities on this here?

313
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,180
Like to go to movie premieres?

314
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,476
-Hey, what the hell is this?
-What up?

315
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,562
What up? There's nobody here.
l mean, how do l know who gets what?

316
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,230
Oh, man.

317
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,899
Where everybody at?

318
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,567
Are they outside?

319
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,070
They're all outside. Something's going on.

320
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,738
Back up on the curb.

321
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,866
-l saw it out of the corner of my eye.
-Everyone, pIease

322
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,576
get back up on the curb!

323
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,705
Back behind the cones!

324
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,502
French toast, right?

325
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,755
Pastry and a coffee, half decaf, half regular.

326
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,092
-Eggs over?
-What, are you on glue?

327
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,343
Portuguese sausage.

328
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,261
-Portuguese sausage?
-That's right.

329
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,263
You were in this restaurant?

330
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,766
-Cream cheese and bagel?
-Lox and bagel.

331
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,769
-Whitefish.
-Whitefish? l've been looking for you.

332
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,521
How am l gonna do this?
How am l gonna do this?

333
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,897
Got him!

334
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,108
All right! Terrific! Way to go!

335
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,276
All right for the boys in blue!

336
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,945
And girls, too!

337
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,365
l don't know who gets what here.

338
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,867
Fuck it! This shit's getting cold!

339
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,123
Soup's on!

340
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,583
Has anyone seen the corned beef hash?

341
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,044
Hey, waiter!

342
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,800
Hey, shorty!

343
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,636
Hey, hey. l asked for scrambled eggs.

344
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,888
Scrambled eggs.
These are not scrambled eggs!

345
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,932
-Now they're scrambled!
-What about my egg whites?

346
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,810
-Whitefish!
-l found the whitefish.

347
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,651
l don't know where your toast is!
Give me the bagel.

348
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,404
Another half cup of coffee!

349
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,072
Suck it off the floor.

350
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,742
l like it hot!

351
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,993
Waiter!

352
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,078
You eat this!

353
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,832
Mr. Alto, is this a cafeteria?

354
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,167
No.

355
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,502
Then he says, "That's what l thought."

356
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,337
l hired a waiter,

357
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,798
so this is not a cafeteria.

358
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,342
l said, "Yeah, but l had this problem."

359
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,928
He says, "l can hire. l can fire."

360
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,014
End of story. End ofjob.

361
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,933
-What are you going to do now?
-What am l gonna do?

362
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,019
Sometimes you gotta
take the bad with the strong.

363
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,771
ls that an expression?

364
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,231
l don't know. lt's new to me.

365
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,358
Yeah, it's a new expression.

366
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,404
Hey, there goes John.
He's winding up for the pitch.

367
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,324
Want to watch him again?

368
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,618
What the hell's that all about?
Why does he do that?

369
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,994
l told you.

370
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,996
Tell me that again.

371
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,209
The story goes
they brought him up to the majors.

372
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,627
They brought him in.

373
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,588
Relief pitch, crucial game,
something like that.

374
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,423
First pitch he threw, boom.

375
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:57,219
Gave up a home run, lost the game
never pitched again in the majors.

376
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:01,556
Supposedly what he's doing
is always re-enacting that pitch,

377
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,225
trying to get it right,

378
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,810
living that moment.

379
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,186
Boom.

380
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,689
-Any of this sound familiar to you?
-Huh?

381
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,359
Come on. l'll do it again for you tomorrow.

382
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,364
Hell of a thing going through life
living that moment over and over again,

383
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,115
regretting that you never got it right,

384
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,576
you never had another chance. Poor fuck.

385
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,995
l'm not gonna spend my life

386
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,331
living the same moment
over and over again.

387
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,666
l'm going to beat it.

388
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,293
Lorne Greene didn't happen
in his 20s or even in his 30s.

389
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,672
All of a sudden, boom, the guy shows
up on Bonanza he's got white hair.

390
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,006
He hung in there.

391
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,591
You know,
he was in there for the long haul.

392
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,010
l got to hand it to Lorne, he hung in there.

393
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,596
Nothing's ever going to stop me. Nothing.

394
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,016
Bet he was a good pitcher in his day.

395
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,268
What?

396
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,228
What do you want to do?
You want to catch a movie?

397
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,896
l don't know. What's playing?

398
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,148
l don't know.
l'd like to see Gone with the Wind.

399
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,359
-Gone with the Wind?
-Yeah.

400
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,902
Gone with the Wind, you want to see?

401
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,614
l don't know, William.
Nothing from me rubs off on you.

402
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,324
l don't understand it.

403
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,076
From this moment on,

404
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,328
HoIIywood stars wiII be recognized

405
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,664
as unparaIIeIed fundraisers

406
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,584
and morale builders in time of war.

407
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,591
After the war, however,
HoIIywood turns another face to the world.

408
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,719
ln the '20s and '30s it becomes a lotus land

409
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:26,016
whose godIike inhabitants seem
subIimeIy above common concern.

410
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,392
And this is...

411
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:43,283
Oh, shit.

412
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,870
One fucking time. Don't tell me.

413
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,997
Don't fucking tell me!

414
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,583
One fucking time
l leave the fucking radio there.

415
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,377
One time. Son of a bitch!

416
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,463
Son of a bitch!

417
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,756
What?

418
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,299
Get out of the street.

419
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,217
-Son of a bitch!
-Come on!

420
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,136
Come on. Get out of the street.

421
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,015
-Come on! Hey!
-Son of a bitch!

422
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,475
Come on! Get the fuck out of the street!

423
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,978
Hey, what is it, what is it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

424
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,772
-Get out of the street!
-Can't you see l gotta...

425
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,024
What are you going to do,
run me over, here?

426
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,317
Hey, hey!

427
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,027
Hey, get out of the car!

428
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,237
Can't you see l got a fucking problem here?

429
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,989
They stole my radio!

430
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,574
Stupid son of a bitch!

431
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,825
Jesus!

432
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,414
-Hi.
-Hey.

433
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,171
What are you guys doing?

434
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,632
Some lowlife scum stole my car radio.

435
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,259
-Oh, where?
-Right outside.

436
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,388
Yeah, they said there have been
six or seven stolen this past week.

437
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,348
That's epidemic proportions.

438
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,810
What is the gun
and the video camera all about?

439
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,187
Well, the police aren't going
to do anything about it.

440
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,814
They don't care.

441
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,774
This is a two-hour battery.

442
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,026
What are you guys supposed to be doing?

443
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,237
l'm gonna catch the thief myself.

444
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,488
Video him.

445
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,493
This is a good idea.

446
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,745
Have you lost your mind?

447
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,039
Have you gone completely and totally nuts?

448
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,001
You know what it's like
to find your car violated, huh?

449
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,420
Your car radio gone.
Something you care about gone,

450
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,338
and nobody's going to do
anything about it?

451
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,091
Yeah. Jimmy, it's just a radio car.

452
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,052
l want something done. l want satisfaction.

453
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,679
You just gonna wait outside,

454
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,598
-wait for someone to break into a car?
-That's right.

455
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,602
l'm going to videotape him in the act,
arrest him, and hand him over to the police.

456
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,563
Some couples,
they spend their Saturday evenings

457
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,314
going to movies or clubs.

458
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,233
My boyfriend is going to be in the bushes,

459
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,110
looking for some thief.

460
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,738
Do you have any idea how absurd this is?

461
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,949
William, will you get that
away from my face?

462
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,785
l'm sorry. l was just checking
the autofocus at a low light.

463
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,455
l'm sorry. l must have lost my mind.

464
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:57,959
Hey, Will,

465
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,420
these blanks are not all the same size.

466
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,589
l wasn't taping.

467
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,432
-What day is this?
-The fifth.

468
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,642
-lt's not the fourth?
-Fifth.

469
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,187
Wednesday the fifth?

470
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,314
Tuesday the 5th.

471
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,860
ls this the beginning of Tuesday,
or was it Tuesday?

472
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,072
What l'm saying is, is this last night,

473
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,783
or is it now tomorrow, the fifth?

474
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,536
This day is the fifth.

475
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,289
lt has begun the fifth, not ending the fifth.

476
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,291
On the sixth
l got to get my head checked out.

477
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,793
The accident.

478
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,378
lt feels pretty good, though, doesn't it?

479
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,340
Yeah, except for the buzzing and humming,
whatever that is.

480
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,674
Still?

481
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,136
-What did the doctor say?
-When?

482
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,847
You said you had
an appointment on the sixth.

483
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,058
This is the seventh. What did he say?

484
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,644
l don't remember anything that important.

485
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,856
Up or down?

486
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,614
Make sure you don't get me
in the shot, okay?

487
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,993
Okay.

488
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,122
Can't see him very well yet, can you?

489
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,873
No, l'm not focused yet.

490
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,961
The filthy cretin.

491
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,508
This is weird. l feel dizzy.

492
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,770
l don't know why anybody bothers to
roll up their windows.

493
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,523
They steal your radio, and then
you gotta have your windows redone.

494
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,066
Scumbags.

495
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,653
Okay, this is it. Come on. Let's get him.

496
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,950
Okay, scumball, get out of the car.

497
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,035
What are you, cops?

498
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,746
No, FBl. Come on.
Get out of the car. Get out!

499
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,582
Put the radio up. Put it up.

500
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,708
Got that?

501
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,168
What the hell's going on here?

502
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,170
Never mind. We're going to take
a little walk to the squad car.

503
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,838
Come on. Pick your stuff up. Come on.

504
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,048
Got my radio in there, too, probably? Sure.

505
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,050
Who do you work for, Radio Shack?

506
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,469
Now, where do you sell these radios?

507
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:18,933
Where do you sell these radios?
l will kill you. Don't try me.

508
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,520
Are you gonna fuck with me?

509
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,773
-1 149 North Western Avenue, sir.
-That's a good boy.

510
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,454
Did you write the note for the police?

511
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,790
-Was l supposed to write the note?
-Yes.

512
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,798
What are you doing?

513
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,425
l'm writing the note.

514
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,344
That's a labeling machine.

515
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,639
l know. l just don't want the police
to recognize my handwriting.

516
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,098
Pardon moi.

517
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,741
Here's an unusuaI story.

518
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,953
HoIIywood poIice report
that a robbery suspect

519
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,164
was Ieft in front of the poIice station
early this morning.

520
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,668
Two car radios, which he is accused
of steaIing, were taped to his body.

521
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:31,172
That, according to a videotape and note
which accompanied the radios.

522
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,967
-Do you want a little conditioner?
-Yes, l do.

523
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,468
No further information is available.

524
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,263
PoIice say the note stated, "To the poIice,

525
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,849
"this guy stoIe two car radios Iast night.

526
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,394
"This is a video of his thievery.

527
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,105
"If you can't do the job, we can.

528
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,898
"Signed, the S.O.S."

529
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,235
There's no information
on the size of this S.O.S.

530
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,237
or what their intentions may be.

531
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,407
We'II keep you updated as more
information on this becomes available.

532
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,450
-In other news, a HoIIywood man...
-Jimmy.

533
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,590
-That my phone?
-No.

534
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,829
Jimmy.

535
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,456
Hey, honey.

536
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,958
l just thought l'd get some sun.

537
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,502
l read in the trades
they're looking for a newcomer

538
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,005
for that new movie Urban Nomad.

539
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,382
Get a little color on my face.

540
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,051
l want to talk to you.

541
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,429
-What?
-l want to talk to you!

542
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,056
Well, sit down.

543
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,599
Not here.

544
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,434
William, you, too.

545
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,772
-So you did it, didn't you?
-What?

546
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,315
The car radio guy.

547
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,027
Dropping him off at the police station.
You actually did it. Didn't you?

548
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,404
Well, it just so happens, yes.
But how did you know?

549
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,947
l saw it on the news.

550
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,657
-News? lt got on the news?
-Yeah.

551
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:22,742
No kidding?

552
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,954
lt's bad enough what the two of you did,
but did you have to leave that note?

553
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,248
Well, l mean, you got to understand
the circumstances.

554
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,334
So you guys are now the S.O.S.

555
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,668
What?

556
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,338
The note. You guys are now the S.O.S.

557
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,551
-What did you put in that note?
-l just signed it.

558
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,678
l mean, it had to come from somebody.

559
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,598
Yeah, but where'd you come up
with S.O.S.?

560
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,392
lt's that movie producer guy.

561
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,851
What movie producer guy?

562
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,354
lt's his initials.
The guy who did Gone with the Wind.

563
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,398
David O. Selznick?

564
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,983
David? l thought his name was Steven.

565
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,362
No. Steven is Spielberg.
David is O. Selznick.

566
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,447
l love that Gone with the Wind.

567
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,658
Please, this is serious.

568
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,245
The television believes
there's some kind of an organization,

569
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,039
some kind of vigilante organization.

570
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,338
You shouldn't have did that, William.
l mean, you shouldn't have done that.

571
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:21,426
l wanted to draw attention to the crime,

572
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,387
not the Steven O. Selznick gang.

573
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,721
Just what you need.

574
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,724
The police are looking
for terrorists or something like that.

575
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,520
Jimmy, you has to promise me
that this is finished.

576
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:37,191
Lorraine, this is no big to-do.
lt's all over with. lt's over.

577
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,943
-Really?
-Yes, it's over with.

578
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,488
She's got a point, though, William.
You know, keeping quiet on this.

579
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,782
"Frankly, my dear, l don't give a damn."

580
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,200
Wasn't that Gone with the Wind?

581
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,037
Yes, that was Gone With the Wind.
And it was also David O. Selznick.

582
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,708
S.O.S. Steven O. Selznick.

583
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,585
How long did they run it?

584
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,962
-Three and a half hours.
-No.

585
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,506
Gone with the Wind was
a little over three and a half hours.

586
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,467
-Yeah, but they...
-l'm asking about the news,

587
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,636
the report on the S.O.S.
lt was three and a half hours?

588
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,389
What'd they do,
a mini-series on the S.O.S. soap pads?

589
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,682
Thought it was Gone with the Wind.

590
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,184
No, it was 1 5 minutes.

591
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,144
l know how long Gone with the Wind was.

592
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,937
What channel was it on?

593
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,152
-That wasn't on that Spanish station.
-No, no, no. English, English.

594
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,571
-BBC? lt was international?
-No. No.

595
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,407
RBR? No. RBZ. RBZ.

596
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,743
We don't have RBZ in this country,
Lorraine.

597
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,829
-ABC?
-No. Other letters.

598
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,039
-NBC?
-NBC! That's right.

599
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,291
Bingo! l feel like l won something.

600
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,586
The suspect was apprehended
by a group that calls itself the S.O.S.

601
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:42,089
This note was made available
by poIice officiaIs.

602
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:43,633
"To the Police:

603
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,636
"This guy stoIe two car radios Iast night.

604
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,055

00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,557
"If you can't do the job, we can.

606
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,601
"Signed, the S.O.S."

607
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,187
The poIice say they have
no previous information

608
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,730
on this S.O.S.

609
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,482
lt seems to be their first act.

610
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,734
The size of the group is undetermined.

611
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,528
Elsewhere in local news...

612
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,112
S.O.S. l like that.

613
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,907
l wish l'd known they were gonna put it
on television though, you know.

614
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,576
l would've made you write
something with a little more flair to it.

615
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,453
Punched it up for you a little bit.
More dramatic.

616
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,997
-The "thievery" l thought was good.
-Which?

617
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,500
What are you talking?
What are you talking about?

618
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,420
l'm talking to myself. Just ranting.
Going on and on about nothing.

619
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,423
Have some more of this tortilla.
She cooks this real good.

620
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,591
l know.

621
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,593
Got potatoes in there, eggs, everything.

622
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,180
lt's good for you. You get eggs.
You don't even have to have breakfast.

623
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,310
They let the guy go,
and they're looking for the S.O.S.

624
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,312
l mean, isn't it amazing?

625
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,232
Here we are, trying to do good,
helping to protect,

626
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,692
and what do they do?

627
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,487
They're looking for the kidnappers
of this lowlife scumbag.

628
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,782
All of a sudden we're the villains,
the S.O.S.

629
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,910
-Hey, is that your ad?
-Yeah.

630
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,787
You look better in your photo.

631
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,498
Fuck you! Fuck you!

632
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,002
All of a sudden
this fucking schmuck knows something.

633
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,670
He knows something.

634
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,007
lt looks the same. lt looks the same, right?

635
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,593
This is crazy. They're looking for
the head of the organization.

636
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,595
They wanna know what his name is.

637
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,389
-Who?
-The head of the organization.

638
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,099
Who is he?

639
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,643
There is no head of the organization.

640
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,021
lf they're thinking there's an organization,

641
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,940
then who's the head of the organization?

642
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,027
l don't know what you're talking about.

643
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,239
Remember years ago,
the S.L.A. with Patty Hearst?

644
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,950
This guy Cinque was the head of the S.L.A.

645
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:37,538
That being the case,
the S.O.S. needs a spokesman.

646
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,082
That'll be my role. l'll be the spokesman.

647
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:45,087
The recent decision by the poIice
to reIease the prisoner...

648
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,175
How does it look if l stand like this?

649
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,219
lt looks like you don't have any arms,
kind of. lt looks like...

650
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:56,307
-No arms? ls that stronger?
-Stronger? l don't know.

651
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,142
-How about this? How about this?
-That's good.

652
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,310
-lt's good?
-l like that.

653
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,562
lt's like, you know,
Superman used to stand like this.

654
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,981
-Remember he used to stand like this?
-Yeah.

655
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,025
All right. How's this?

656
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,738
Don't... Don't go like this.
You just throw me off.

657
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,741
l'm trying to get into the thing here
and you... Don't do that.

658
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,743
-What do you want me to do?
-Well, just nod or something.

659
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,328
l mean, l know it's running,
l know you're ready.

660
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,746
l mean you don't have to...

661
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,247
-l'm pausing it right now.
-This isn't, this isn't...

662
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,499
l'll shake my head.

663
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,376
-Okay.
-Okay.

664
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,921
Are you gonna keep shaking your head?
Don't keep shaking it. You don't have to.

665
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,507
-Just once is enough, okay?
-Okay.

666
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,260
This is J-Three, head of the S.O.S.

667
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,180
No. Let me do it again. Let me do it again.

668
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,684
This is J-Three, cell leader for the S.O.S.

669
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,520
That cell leader's got a nice ring to it.
Don't you think?

670
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,688
-Keep the tape rolling.
-Okay.

671
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,940
Keep tape rolling. Don't stop.

672
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,693
This is J-Five, cell leader of the S.O.S.

673
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,945
The recent decision by... Hold on.

674
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:54,281
This is K-Four, cell leader of the S.O.S.

675
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,034
Has K-Four been used
for something else before?

676
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,787
K-2 is a mountain. K-9 is a dog.

677
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,457
Like the Js better?

678
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:08,045
Who am l?

679
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,715
You're the leader of the S.O.S.

680
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,342
l know that, William, but who is J-Three?

681
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:16,303
What do l think? What do l feel?

682
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,930
How do l know?

683
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:23,644
You see, William,
you got to think of this in acting terms.

684
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,313
What happened to me?

685
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,316
Where am l at this point in time in my life?

686
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,194
What happened to get me where l am?

687
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,238
They stole your radio.

688
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,032
William, this isn't me.

689
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,536
This is the leader of the S.O.S.
l don't want to play me.

690
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,664
Jimmy Alto isn't the leader of the S.O.S.

691
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,168
J-Three is the leader of the S.O.S.

692
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,086
Who is J-Three?

693
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,636
William?

694
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,682
As an actor, when you know
who you are, it's easy to talk.

695
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,101
When you don't,
you don't know what's coming next,

696
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,520
you don't know where you are.

697
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,900
l'm an actor playing a vigilante.
That's not enough. That's not enough!

698
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,527
Who am l? Who am l?

699
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,490
l have to know who l am.

700
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,535
Until l know who l am,
the S.O.S. can't make a statement.

701
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,041
ls that my phone?

702
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,709
No.

703
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,629
This is Jericho, cell leader of the S.O.S.

704
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,716
Let it be known from this day forth
that lawlessness will not be tolerated.

705
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,928
This is a promise to
aII the good citizens of HoIIywood.

706
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,473
We give fair warning to the poIice
and to the judiciaI system.

707
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,476
Protect and serve
the good peopIe of HoIIywood,

708
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,479
because we wiII be watching and waiting.

709
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:53,943
This is our pledge. S.O.S. Save our streets.

710
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,903
-Jimmy.
-This tape was given excIusiveIy

711
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,446
-to Channel 5 News.
-What have you done?

712
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,200
We have shown it to the poIice,
who have issued a statement to the effect

713
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,453
that this type of organization
will not be tolerated.

714
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,332
They have further stated that
they wiII fuIIy mobiIize the poIice force

715
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,251
to combat the S.O.S.,

716
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,712
shouId this iIIegaI criminaI behavior
show itseIf again.

717
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,589
As to the leader of the S.O.S.,

718
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:20,469
the poIice are not discussing any cIues
they may have at this time.

719
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,098
Earlier this afternoon,
a storefront fire in the Fairfax district

720
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,183
threatened several commercial structures.

721
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,061
The bIaze broke out in a vacant buiIding
in the 400 block

722
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,855
of North Fairfax Avenue.

723
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,649
l thought l was pretty good.
What'd you think?

724
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,193
l don't know. lt took 35 or 40 goes to get it.

725
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,779
l kind of lost my perspective.

726
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,323
ls she okay?

727
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,953
l better go see what her problem is.

728
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,259
l wanted to at least let Hollywood know
that there was somebody there.

729
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,970
The way it was left, it felt open-ended.

730
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,805
l had to put a cap on it.

731
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,434
This is the end now.

732
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,810
Really?

733
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,482
-What'd you think of the work?
-The work?

734
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,819
Yeah, the work.
What'd you think of Jericho?

735
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,989
Jimmy, you're playing with fire here,

736
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,116
and you want to know
how your acting was?

737
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,077
Did you believe him?

738
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,580
Yes, yes. l believe him.

739
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,709
Did he seem sympathetic?

740
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,548
See, l felt there was a vulnerability.

741
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:45,679
l mean, l thought there was toughness,
but, you know, there was vulnerability.

742
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,516
Terry Malloy, On The Waterfront.

743
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,729
-Brando. He had vulnerability.
-Yeah.

744
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,316
Remember that scene l always play for you?

745
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,694
-What?
-Eva Marie Saint. She drops the glove.

746
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,741
He picks it up, tries to put it on his hand.

747
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,664
He was a boxer, a tough guy,

748
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,042
and he's trying to put
a little white glove on his hand.

749
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,589
Macho into femininity.
lt happened all at the same time.

750
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,095
l mean, don't forget,
l was at a disadvantage.

751
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,222
l mean, l was in the shadows.

752
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,725
You couldn't see my eyes.
lt all had to be done with the voice.

753
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,561
You know, put me at a big disadvantage,

754
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:39,942
but l thought l came across
threatening, tough and vulnerable.

755
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,819
l had vulnerability, too, right?

756
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,904
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

757
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,535
Okay. l'm gonna take a bath.

758
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,096
You know, another thing
you got to remember, too.

759
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,307
lt's the first time l played Jericho.

760
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:17,271
l mean, l'm not gonna do it,
but imagine if l got more familiar with him.

761
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,067
lf l was allowed to do an
80 or 90-minute piece on Jericho

762
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,529
instead of a one-minute clip,
think of it that way.

763
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,198
This is a promise to
aII the good citizens of HoIIywood.

764
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,453
We give fair warning to the poIice
and to the judiciaI system

765
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,664
to protect and serve
the good peopIe of HoIIywood,

766
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,500
because we wiII be watching and waiting.

767
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,461
-This is our pIedge.
-lt's even better with repeated viewing.

768
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,505
S.O.S. Save our streets.

769
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,632
Definitely better with repeated viewing.

770
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,142
Jimmy. Men with ties.

771
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,983
-Detectives, looks like.
-Yeah.

772
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,527
You think they're looking into the S.O.S.?

773
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,906
The car radio guy
could've told them the street.

774
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,830
Wonder if they'll come and question me.

775
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,500
Be interesting questioning me.
Don't you think?

776
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,252
l could do a real number
if they question me.

777
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,130
Where were you on the night of so-and-so?

778
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,049
l could really do a number.

779
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,929
Do you want to go out for breakfast
and leave me at work?

780
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,847
Yeah. Yeah.

781
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,394
You know, if they question me,
l could play it real quiet.

782
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,105
Long pauses, you know.

783
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,982
l'd drive them crazy. Pause. Pause.

784
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:47,861
l'd play this real deliberate kind of a guy.
l'll make them nuts.

785
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,704
They just didn't know is
what l think they were saying.

786
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,500
They mentioned an MRl and they said
maybe they'd see something.

787
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,585
'Cause l definitely don't
remember things well.

788
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,796
l don't know. What do you think, Jimmy?

789
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,174
l don't know. "This is MRl. This is MRl."

790
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,969
-l think Jericho's better.
-Got you a lollipop.

791
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,680
-ls that root beer?
-No.

792
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,807
No? l like root beer.

793
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,977
You know, when you get this MRl, you're
gonna see everything's gonna be okay.

794
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,353
So don't worry, you know?

795
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,981
You're just a little preoccupied.
That's why you're blanking.

796
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,066
-You think so?
-Yeah.

797
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,990
Look at this.
We gotta get right behind this bus now.

798
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,368
These people, they kill everybody
with these fumes.

799
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,412
They should put something
on these things.

800
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,955
l mean, look. This is disgusting.

801
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,887
-How big is this part?
-lt's a nice little role.

802
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,722
lt takes place in one
of the underground clubs.

803
00:41:56,806 --> 00:42:01,351
Yeah? Well, l mean, if this isn't
a lead role, l might be wasting my time.

804
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,020
Don't you have
some other principal roles there?

805
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,646
No, these are the roles we're casting.

806
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,648
l understand that,
but what about the principal roles?

807
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,774
Were they already cast?

808
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:12,070
This is what we're casting right now.
l can't tell you about anything else.

809
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,948
Well, l came for a principal role.

810
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,201
Well, this is all we have.

811
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,412
The ad in the trades said a principal role.

812
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:24,499
This is not a principal role.
This is a little role here, one line.

813
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,335
Do you have a picture and resume?

814
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,212
He's got his own bus bench ad.

815
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,547
He's right.
l have a bus bench right on Sunset.

816
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,382
Right at the gates of Bel Air.

817
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,259
A big advertisement,
cost me a lot of money,

818
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:37,095
and as we speak l have new pictures
being made. l mean, you...

819
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,513
-Excuse me.
-What? What?

820
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,849
-What's your name?
-Jimmy Alto. Who are you?

821
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,894
-l'm Rob Weiss, the film's director.
-The director. How are you, Rob?

822
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,979
-How's it going?
-We were just discussing over

823
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,814
some roles that are available here.

824
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:48,982
l wanna read him for Lewis.

825
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,984
l think you'd be interested
in this part of Lewis.

826
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,986
Lewis? Who's Lewis? He's a principal?

827
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,571
-He's a principal.
-Now we're talking. See?

828
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,989
l want to take... He's going to come with me.

829
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,574
l want to do this.
Do you have time to do this?

830
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,660
Well, l just... You know,
l have to run across town.

831
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,080
l have another appointment with a director,
but l can push that appointment off.

832
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,332
l don't think you have
any other appointments.

833
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,334
-lt's a little later, the appointment...
-He's a lot like Lewis.

834
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,669
Listen, l wanna take you with me.

835
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,753
lf you come with us to the end of the hall,

836
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,796
maybe we can do some work.

837
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,006
-Just take a couple of minutes.
-Sure. No problem at all.

838
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,174
Thanks for your help, sweetheart.

839
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,426
You know, Rob,
this girl has a bit of an attitude.

840
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,844
l mean, she tried to dismiss me

841
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,638
like l was some kind of an extra
or something.

842
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,682
Yeah, we'll take care of that ourselves.

843
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,436
So, did you happen to see any of
that S.O.S. stuff on the news last night?

844
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,106
-The what?
-The S.O.S. story with Jericho.

845
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,774
l think you're going way over my head here.

846
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,277
l don't know what you're talking about.

847
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:38,323
Thought you said that Channel 5 was
the number one news station, William?

848
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,799
Jimmy, l want you
to understand something here.

849
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,052
All right, this is a very inexpensive film,
so it's not really scripted.

850
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,762
Well, there's not a script-script.

851
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,472
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna improv a lot of it.

852
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,808
-lt's going to be real loose.
-Hey, that's when l'm at my best,

853
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,810
when l'm loose, when l'm free, you know.

854
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,271
Hey, you give me words, sometimes it
pulls me down. You know what l mean?

855
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,565
Listen, l have this guy outside
l know who is going to play Tom.

856
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,774
Okay, l'm gonna bring him in here.

857
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,568
What l want you guys to do
is do some improv for me.

858
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:15,944
-Hey, no problem.
-So l get a feel, you know?

859
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,070
Get really loose with him.

860
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,656
Hey, it's a principal role. Of course.

861
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,535
Stella! Loosening up my voice.

862
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,412
lt's all right.

863
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,583
Get up now, you big tub of guts.

864
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,253
Hey, the heads of the family,
l want them all here.

865
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,841
So, what do you want to do?

866
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,926
You want to kill him? 'Cause l'll kill him.

867
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,429
l'll kill him if that's what you want me to do.

868
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,306
So, you want to kill him?

869
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,143
What are you saying, l can't?
'Cause l'll kill him.

870
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,064
lt's just that you seemed
a little ambivalent about it.

871
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,274
You see something in these eyes
that says l'm ambivalent?

872
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:15,212
Guess which one of your favorite actors
got the second lead in Urban Nomad?

873
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,381
-Really?
-That's right.

874
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,002
Jimmy Alto. Remember that name.

875
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:00,424
Urban Nomad. Probably be out
the beginning of next year sometime.

876
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,609
-ls that my phone?
-No.

877
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,031
Hi, this is Jimmy AIto.
I'm on the set right now,

878
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,742
so pIease Ieave a message
or a fax for me. Thanks.

879
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,329
Hi. This is Linda from Rob Weiss' office.

880
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,248
We've been trying to get in touch with you.

881
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:37,085
UnfortunateIy, we've had to go with
our second choice for the role of Lewis.

882
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,464
We're very sorry, Mr. AIto.
Thank you again for coming in.

883
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,386
The burden of battle.

884
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,306
Stars like Al Jolson,

885
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,808
Debbie ReynoIds,

886
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,519
Mickey Rooney,

887
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,813
and MariIyn Monroe.

888
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:03,528
This is a traditional scene,
a traditionaI thing for a star to do,

889
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:08,116
for it was estabIished Iong ago
that when the nation went to war,

890
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,368
HoIIywood went, too.

891
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,806
lt's a shame. You know that?

892
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,061
lt all happened before l got here.

893
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,273
This was the Mecca for dreams.

894
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,278
This place used to sparkle.

895
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,283
You could rub shoulders with movie stars
walking along the boulevard.

896
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,245
The glamour...

897
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,625
Look at Hollywood now.

898
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,298
No wonder l can't make it.
lt's over. lt's over.

899
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,816
You know something, William?
Gotham had Batman.

900
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,986
Hollywood needs the S.O.S.

901
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:30,115
l just realized it. They need Jericho.

902
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:39,332
We got to get some better
television coverage, you know?

903
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,528
Do you believe
the police can't see this shit?

904
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,864
Seems pretty amazing, doesn't it?

905
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,118
We're going to just keep taping everything,

906
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,954
send all the tapes to the TV station.

907
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,082
Put it all on television.

908
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,295
Let the people see

909
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,131
just how fucked up all this is.

910
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,802
Right in plain view.

911
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,389
You remember that Medfly problem?

912
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,477
lt was a little tiny Medfly.

913
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,564
They tracked it down,
and they caught it in Hancock Park,

914
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,484
and they can't find these drug dealers.

915
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:53,657
But we're going to be the watchdogs,

916
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,909
the guardians.

917
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:06,586
Look what they've done to my Hollywood.

918
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,268
Relax, William.

919
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,314
What are you guys up to?

920
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,692
l don't think that's any of
your fucking business.

921
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,151
Yes, it is, actually.

922
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,570
My friends, they have a thing
about being taped.

923
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,239
Really?

924
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,576
So, what do you suggest we do?

925
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,830
l suggest you stop taping.
Now give me the tape.

926
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,291
Get away or l'll put a bullet through
your fucking head.

927
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,097
Oh, shit!

928
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,979
He shot his own guy.

929
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,328
William, you okay? William?

930
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,539
Yeah, l'm okay.

931
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,295
This place is crazy. What, does
everybody have a gun? What is it?

932
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,722
l loved that car.

933
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,307
You really didn't have much choice.

934
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:45,518
lf those guys talked,
they finger the car, we're dead.

935
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,021
Yeah, but l loved that car.

936
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,900
We came to Hollywood together
a long time ago.

937
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,583
These drug deaIers operate openIy
and freeIy in the HoIIywood area.

938
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,794
The wounding of one of
the drug deaIers occurred

939
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,506
when he went up against two members
of the S.O.S. force.

940
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,051
Let this be a signaI. Don't tread on us.

941
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,262
We wiII never initiate aggressive action.

942
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,682
But we wiII certainIy return gunfire
when deemed appropriate.

943
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,727
l can't take this, Jimmy. l can't live this way.

944
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:29,687
What?

945
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,482
Don't you see how wrong this is?
Don't you understand?

946
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,317
ls there something wrong with you?

947
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,654
Jericho. That's good. That's good.

948
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,490
With William it's understandable.
He doesn't know any better.

949
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,534
At best, he's half there.

950
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,829
Are you telling me that this is not effective?

951
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,999
lt's great acting. l mean, come on,
Lorraine, look how believable this is.

952
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,169
Jimmy, somebody was shot.
You could have been killed. Dead!

953
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,337
We're reaIIy not at Iiberty right now

954
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,464
to taIk about the specifics of the case.

955
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,508
But we do have several leads. Yes.

956
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,844
Oh, my God, Jimmy, they're gonna get you.

957
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,012
They're gonna put you in prison.

958
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,849
-...statement from Jericho...
-Yes!

959
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,353
Look at this! They're paying attention.
They're all paying attention!

960
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,896
lt's a media blitz!

961
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:15,483
lt works. lt works. Jericho works.

962
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,694
lt's a great role, Lorraine.

963
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:20,029
-...Jericho warned other law breakers...
-lt's a great role.

964
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,281
...not to chaIIenge them.

965
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,372
l'm gonna be at Janet's for a couple of days.

966
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:34,002
l have to go. l can't even talk to you
about this anymore.

967
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,888
You can't talk to me? You can't talk to me?

968
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,141
You're out of the Oscar speech!

969
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:10,306
"Ride the RTD."

970
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,810
Rapid Transit District, my ass.

971
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,396
Six blocks, four hours.

972
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,951
William! Come on. You're zoning.

973
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,328
What are you doing over here?

974
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,913
Now, you gotta blank out?

975
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,165
What do you think?

976
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,836
This is the place the guy brings
the radios after he rips them off?

977
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,297
"1 149." Never forget a number.

978
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:56,477
Yep. Nobody's making a living
selling this shit. That's for sure.

979
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,772
Hello, there, gentlemen.
What can l do for you?

980
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,443
l thought you might have some radios here.

981
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,445
Radios?

982
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,364
Yeah, you know, car radios.

983
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,200
Well, what you see is what we got.

984
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,622
Yeah, you got great merchandise here.

985
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,668
lt must just fly out of the door.

986
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,339
Listen, l got a very good friend,
says you got some car radios here.

987
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,841
What's his name?

988
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,218
He doesn't like people to mention his name.

989
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,846
Well, l don't do business with strangers.

990
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:38,102
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Sorry, guys. Sorry, sorry.

991
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,396
l thought there was a bathroom in here.

992
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,523
Who the fuck are you?
What are you, a cop?

993
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:48,488
lt's obvious they got stolen merchandise
up the gazoo in the back of that place.

994
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,573
What are you thinking about?
You want to get your radio back?

995
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,450
ls that what you're thinking about?

996
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,868
l don't even have my car anymore.

997
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,579
What the fuck would l want my radio for?

998
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,749
So, then what are you thinking about?

999
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:03,586
l'm thinking the S.O.S.
should torch that place.

1000
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,588
At least, l'm sure
that's what Jericho's thinking.

1001
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,091
Put that thieving ring out of business.

1002
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,262
-The big question is...
-What?

1003
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,598
...what do we do for transportation?

1004
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,683
Well, where do you wanna go?

1005
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,522
Maybe we could do a carjacking.

1006
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,399
What's a carjacket?

1007
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,194
-What?
-Carjacket?

1008
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,114
Not a carjacket, a carjacking.

1009
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,242
They stick a gun in somebody's face
and say, "Give me your car."

1010
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,661
And the people give them the car
and they go.

1011
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,830
But we're not real thieves.

1012
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:41,833
Jericho came up to me
and said S.O.S. needed my car

1013
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,376
for one of their missions.

1014
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,044
He said they wouId return it.

1015
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:49,674
And they did. With a fuII tank of gas
and a very nice note thanking me.

1016
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:57,098
-You know what l like about you, William?
-What?

1017
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,268
You're always right there,
no questions asked. Right there.

1018
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,813
l need a gun. You get me a gun.

1019
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,233
We're going to burn down a building,
you're there.

1020
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,903
Thank you, Jimmy.

1021
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,242
You know, there's an advantage
to this memory lapse thing l have.

1022
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,661
l keep forgetting all the bad times.

1023
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:24,083
Well, l remember quite a few,
enough for both of us.

1024
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:31,215
What? You were going to
say something. l can tell. What?

1025
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,510
-New York.
-What about it?

1026
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,139
You know, it's named after York.

1027
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:42,143
And then there's New Jersey.
lt's named after Jersey.

1028
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,270
And then there's New Zealand.

1029
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,315
Where is Zealand?

1030
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,821
Yeah.

1031
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,033
Where's Zealand?

1032
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,410
The fire began early this morning.

1033
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:03,289
Once again, it seems to be the work
of the S.O.S.

1034
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,459
We received this tape
from the S.O.S. Leader, Jericho.

1035
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,045
This store was a front for stolen items,

1036
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:12,340
from car radios to televisions and stereos,

1037
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,800
most of which were drug-reIated.

1038
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:19,222
The S.O.S. will not allow this operation
to continue with business as usual.

1039
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,684
We're out there,
the watchdogs of HoIIywood.

1040
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,394
That's all for now.

1041
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:28,522
S.O.S. Save Our Streets.

1042
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,109
l just get better and better.

1043
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,654
l mean, l don't know.
l hope it's not me, you know,

1044
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:38,658
l'm not putting too much into it,
but l get better and better.

1045
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,120
You want to get some breakfast?

1046
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,707
We just got through eating.

1047
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,799
No. l'm only kidding.

1048
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:58,719
l know you blank all the time,
so l took a shot. l'll be right back.

1049
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,458
ls this Janet's apartment?

1050
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,210
Yes, it is.

1051
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,089
-ls Lorraine here?
-No.

1052
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,092
The two of them went to Big Bear
for the weekend, l think.

1053
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,512
l'm Holly, Janet's cousin.
l'm visiting from Hawaii for a while.

1054
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,308
l'm Jimmy, Lorraine's friend.

1055
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,687
You want to come in for a minute?

1056
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,357
Sure. Yeah. Sure.

1057
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,241
l was just watching a piece on
that S.O.S. group you got out here.

1058
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,368
-Pretty wild.
-You think so?

1059
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,579
Oh, yeah. Everybody's talking about it.

1060
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,748
-Really?
-Yeah.

1061
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,624
l had to go to market the other day,

1062
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,377
there were people at the register
talking about it.

1063
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,923
And what do you think of the situation?

1064
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,925
l think it's a good idea.

1065
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,179
l mean, there's a lot of crime, and
they're out there making a difference.

1066
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,139
Plus, they're not hurting the good people.

1067
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:29,852
Right. And what about this Jericho guy,
their leader? What do you think of him?

1068
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,732
l think he's right.
l think it's brave what he's doing.

1069
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,275
Do you?

1070
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,945
Yeah, well, l've always been really
into that kind of thing.

1071
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,990
You know, kind of underground stuff,
sort of adventurous, you know?

1072
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,533
Yeah.

1073
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:48,496
-French resistance.
-l'm not familiar with them.

1074
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,957
l guess it's unimportant. Doesn't matter.

1075
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,794
Do you want something to drink?

1076
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,381
Yeah. You got any liquor here?

1077
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,092
l'll take a look. l don't know what she has.

1078
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,928
Yeah. Nothing with any pineapple.

1079
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,766
-So what do you do, Jimmy?
-l'm an actor.

1080
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:24,031
Can you imagine what it's like to be
in some super police military thing?

1081
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,827
You know, he's like a Batman or something.

1082
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:31,205
That's right. That's right.

1083
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,832
lt's very dangerous.

1084
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:38,212
lmagine putting your life on the line,
not knowing if you're going to live or die.

1085
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,968
-This Jericho is some kind of guy.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1086
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,972
l mean, he must be a pretty
extraordinary person.

1087
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,015
Special.

1088
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,896
l wonder if he's like a Bruce Wayne.

1089
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,024
You know, a wealthy guy that does that.

1090
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,235
Because you'd have to have
some kind of money

1091
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,488
to train that whole group
and arm them and everything.

1092
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,078
What if l told you

1093
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,416
that l know someone in the S.O.S.,

1094
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,044
and that someone...

1095
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,842
Hello.

1096
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,011
Hi, honey.

1097
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,931
l miss you, too.

1098
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,517
Hold on a second.

1099
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,020
l'm going to be on a while.

1100
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:39,023
That's okay.
l forgot that l have an appointment.

1101
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,108
-l'm going to run.
-Okay.

1102
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:45,613
Hi, honey.

1103
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,781
No, I feeI better. I might be abIe to
waIk down the street tonight.

1104
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,450
l think the S.O.S. is doing a really good job.

1105
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,452
l'm a big fan ofthose Death Wish movies.

1106
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,078
I'm sick and tired of being a hostage...

1107
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:55,289
If this is gonna get rid of
some of the crime, I say, "Why not?"

1108
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:56,582
It's time the bad guys were victims.

1109
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,834
l wish l could join S.O.S.

1110
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:02,004
I'm a young girl, I'm singIe,
I'm in this town by myseIf. I don't feeI safe.

1111
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,339
The onIy way you fight fire's with fire.

1112
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:06,467
The poIice couId never intimidate them
the way the S.O.S. can.

1113
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,136
And I am just...
I'm so happy to have Jericho here.

1114
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,597
Jericho. They love Jericho.

1115
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,141
...that there's hope for the city
now that they're here.

1116
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:18,354
The S.O.S. is apparently striking
a favorabIe nerve in HoIIywood.

1117
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:22,900
In an unofficiaI teIephone survey
conducted by this station, over 80%...

1118
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,653
lt's a hit. lt's a rave review.

1119
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,780
lt's as good as a review if it was a show.

1120
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:30,115
80%. 80%.

1121
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,744
Look at this. Another drive-by shooting.

1122
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,498
You know what's amazing,
it's on Page 3 of the metro section.

1123
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,043
l mean, it's become so commonplace,
it's on Page 3 of the metro section.

1124
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,629
lt's ridiculous. lt makes me sick.

1125
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,007
What do you want to do today?

1126
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,176
l don't know. What do you got in mind?

1127
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,928
l want to go see a movie.

1128
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,764
-l want to go see The Mummy.
-The Mummy?

1129
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,769
Will, don't start with The Mummy, okay?
lt's a little early.

1130
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,021
My father let me stay up
and watch Fright Night.

1131
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,231
That's when l first saw it.

1132
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,942
You know what l couldn't figure out
about the mummy?

1133
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,819
lt's how he always used to walk

1134
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,153
with one arm behind him
and a leg dragging.

1135
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,489
Will, Will, l know.

1136
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,158
Let me ask you a question.

1137
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,828
How come the only time
you mention your father

1138
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,414
is with this Fright Night mummy thing?

1139
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:21,000
Don't you have any other memories?

1140
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,336
l remember he used to call me "useless."

1141
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,672
He did, huh?

1142
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,092
Well, let me tell you something.

1143
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,468
l was a salesman

1144
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,138
and l can size up
people's characters pretty good,

1145
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,266
and you have a lot of potential.
A lot of potential.

1146
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:40,352
Don't let anybody tell you different, ever.

1147
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,104
You just haven't clicked
with the right thing yet,

1148
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,939
but when you do, boom!

1149
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:45,858
You're going to be on your way.

1150
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,443
Big things are going to happen for you.

1151
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,862
Trust me. A lot of potential.

1152
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,032
-Potential.
-Right.

1153
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,204
-Who's this?
-Steve.

1154
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,293
All right, all right. This time.

1155
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,670
Don't bring nobody else new, man.

1156
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,107
Stick up your hands, please.

1157
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,735
-Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
-You want the money?

1158
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,904
-Take the money.
-No, no, no. We don't want your money.

1159
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,198
-You don't want the money?
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

1160
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:36,533
lt's not cheap running
a terrorist organization, here.

1161
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,036
Hey, he's got a gun! He's got a gun!

1162
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,329
-Give it up!
-Get it! Get it!

1163
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,664
l got it!

1164
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,582
-Look this way. Look this way.
-What are we gonna tie him with?

1165
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,250
What do you want to do with him?

1166
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,920
We can't take him to the police station.
lt's been done already.

1167
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:51,173
Why don't we just keep him captive
like the Hezbollah?

1168
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,883
Hezbollah?

1169
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,510
Where could we put him?

1170
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,762
Can't keep him at my place.

1171
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,014
l guess l can keep him
at my place for one day.

1172
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,183
l mean, it's safe.
Lorraine's out of town, anyway.

1173
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,018
Come on, let's go.

1174
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,124
What the fuck was that
you were listening to?

1175
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,875
Listen to me clearly.

1176
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,587
You have been sentenced to five years
in an S.O.S. holding cell.

1177
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,716
-You will be chained to a bed.
-Chained to the bed?

1178
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,802
l ain't with no freaky stuff man.
Y'all just kill me right now.

1179
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,388
You saw the way
the American hostages were treated?

1180
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,391
You will be treated in the same fashion,

1181
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,977
-as an enemy of the people.
-Enemy of the people?

1182
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,603
l got a few character flaws,

1183
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,147
but l ain't no enemy of the people.

1184
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,815
l just like nice things.

1185
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,317
S.O.S. Save our souls.

1186
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,007
That's my parking.

1187
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,546
l miss you, Jimmy.

1188
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,132
l miss you, too.

1189
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,302
l hate myself for coming back,

1190
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,137
but what am l going to do?

1191
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:05,224
l don't want to be out of your Oscar speech.

1192
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:09,311
You're not going to be
out of my Oscar speech.

1193
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,608
Wait, wait, wait.

1194
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,486
l have to go to the bathroom.

1195
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,804
He's gone crazy.

1196
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:45,764
Jimmy!

1197
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,769
-What?
-Have you lost your mind?

1198
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:55,023
Listen. Let's go in the other room.
l don't want him to hear anything.

1199
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,984
Okay, okay.

1200
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:06,285
What the hell is this guy doing
in my bathtub, bound and gagged?

1201
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:09,037
-l didn't know you were coming home.
-That explains it.

1202
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,248
There's a fantastic answer.

1203
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,877
See, what we're doing is,
is kind of like a Hezbollah kind of thing.

1204
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,753
-You say Hezbollah?
-Hezbollah, yeah.

1205
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:19,089
You know, the Lebanese stuff.

1206
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,465
-Yeah.
-The terrorist group.

1207
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,051
-Yeah.
-Yeah. The ones that take the hostages.

1208
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,889
See, l just didn't want
to drop him off at the police station.

1209
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,683
A drug-dealing thing.
l mean, we've already done that.

1210
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,645
So what we're doing is, we're setting up,
like, an intimidation factor,

1211
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,063
you know?

1212
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:39,610
Hey, listen, do you know how many tourists
visit Beirut a year? Do you?

1213
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:40,944
-No, no.
-None.

1214
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,821
Zip. Nada.

1215
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,531
Do you know how many visit LA?

1216
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:48,702
Millions. And there's more killings in LA
than there is in Beirut.

1217
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:51,413
There's more crime
in Los Angeles than there is in Beirut,

1218
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,789
-and you know why?
-No.

1219
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,958
Hezbollah, Hezbollah.

1220
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:59,296
They're scared shitless about
that Hezbollah kind of stuff. That's why.

1221
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,131
What the hell
are you talking about, Jimmy?

1222
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,801
What are you talking about?
There is a man in my bathtub.

1223
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,428
lntimidating a criminal.

1224
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,721
That's what l'm talking about.

1225
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,932
The police don't intimidate them.

1226
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,267
So, big deal, they get arrested.

1227
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:14,353
They do six months to a year.

1228
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,021
They go into the cells.

1229
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,773
They watch television.

1230
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,692
They do exercises. Big deal.

1231
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,278
The S.O.S.,
you know what we're going to do?

1232
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,907
The S.O.S. intimidates the criminal element.

1233
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:30,369
Tie him to a bed for five years.
Scare the shit out of them.

1234
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,664
So, you want me to actually live
in this house here with the hostages?

1235
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,374
ls that the next step, Jimmy?

1236
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,835
l get up a little earlier in the morning
and feed the hostages.

1237
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,379
-ls that it?
-No, no.

1238
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,090
This is a one-day thing.
l'm letting this guy go.

1239
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:48,136
l want him to go back into the community
and spread the message. lntimidation.

1240
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:51,390
To think, a couple of days' work
on a soap opera or something

1241
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,600
might have prevented this.

1242
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,480
Jimmy, where are we
supposed to go from here?

1243
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,565
Well, listen,

1244
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,276
l'm going to get rid of this scumbag
right after dark,

1245
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,737
but l don't know
what's going to happen from there.

1246
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,532
You're becoming
another one of those media freaks,

1247
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,951
those people
they keep making into celebrities.

1248
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,161
This is not about celebrityism.

1249
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,247
This is about the craft of acting.

1250
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,833
lt's not a vigilante who's popular,

1251
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,544
it's an actor portraying a vigilante.

1252
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,463
The people believe Jericho.

1253
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,800
That's like the true tribute

1254
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,760
to my acting ability.

1255
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,015
Lorraine, look...

1256
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:36,977
l love you, but...

1257
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:40,313
Let me at least enjoy the fame a little.

1258
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,550
You stay down for five minutes.
Otherwise, l'll be back. You got it?

1259
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,136
-Yeah, man.
-Okay, man.

1260
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:51,384
This was supposed to have been
Errol Flynn's house.

1261
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,523
Can you imagine overlooking Hollywood?

1262
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,691
Looking right down on it.

1263
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,363
Warner Brothers right over the hill.

1264
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,616
You finish Captain Blood, you come home,

1265
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,369
you got a nice living room, you sit down,

1266
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:21,039
the butler gives you
the new script from the studio,

1267
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:23,041
go dancing at Ciro's,

1268
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,544
all those things.

1269
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,298
lmagine me coming home
in the evening, Lorraine?

1270
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,384
We get ready to go out.

1271
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,220
You put on a gown,

1272
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,430
l put on a tuxedo.

1273
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:41,309
Dancing with the big dance bands.

1274
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:45,814
Going to some grand premiere
at the Grauman's Chinese.

1275
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,114
lmagine if l was here back then?

1276
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,158
l'd be as big as Cagney,

1277
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,410
as big as Edward G. Robinson.

1278
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:03,415
l'd have been right there with them at Ciro's
and the Brown Derby, schmoozing.

1279
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,501
"Hey, Eddie G., how you doing?"

1280
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,796
"Who's that? Oh, it's Jimmy Alto!
Hey, Jimmy, how you doing?"

1281
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:13,258
"Sit down. You know Cagney."
"Hey, how you doing?"

1282
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,594
l'd have been right there with them.

1283
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,597
Rubbing shoulders with the best of them.

1284
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,895
But there's nothing there anymore.

1285
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,354
lt's over.

1286
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,818
There's nothing down there now
but a bunch of dead stars in cement.

1287
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,698
ln Madrid,
all l ever dream about was Hollywood.

1288
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,368
This is not the Hollywood
l see in the movies.

1289
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,871
lt's not.

1290
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:53,715
Salud.

1291
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,390
Hear that music?

1292
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,976
You don't hear that dance band?

1293
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,479
-Oh, yeah.
-Let's dance.

1294
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,935
Do you have any idea
why a bIack Range Rover

1295
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,355
was parked in your parking space
Iast Friday, August 6th?

1296
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:52,857
No.

1297
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:56,194
ln fact, l haven't even been back there
a few days.

1298
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,363
-Do you have a car?
-Yes.

1299
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,199
WeII, why don't you park your car there?

1300
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,618
Because it's... lt's a new one.

1301
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,205
I mean, I just picked it up today,
as a matter of fact.

1302
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,708
So, until today,

1303
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,210
you didn't have a car?

1304
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,462
That's... Exactly. l had a car.

1305
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,715
l mean, it burned. lt caught fire.

1306
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,551
-Burned?
-Burned.

1307
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,803
Deader than a doornail.

1308
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,221
Remember that?

1309
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,389
No.

1310
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,225
The Postman AIways Rings Twice.
Johnny Garfield.

1311
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,061
Remember he said that to the cop?
That's why l said it to you. You're a cop.

1312
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,981
l said to you. He said it to the cop.
The cop said it to him. He said it back.

1313
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,317
"Deader than a doornail." Remember?

1314
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,320
Don't you remember in Body and Soul
he said,

1315
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:42,324
"What are you going to do, kill me?
Everybody dies."

1316
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,077
A lot of people say
l'm reminiscent of Garfield, too.

1317
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,580
Yeah, well, you're pretty good.

1318
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:49,831
Yeah.

1319
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,000
What you do,
l guess you guys are good, too.

1320
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,669
Hey, who knows, maybe we'll work
together again sometime.

1321
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,171
Bang, bang.

1322
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,090
Yeah.

1323
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,052
Well, they're obviously on to us.

1324
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:05,263
They must have a little bit more
than they're making on to, you know?

1325
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,557
What do we do? What's the next step?

1326
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,142
l don't know. l'm not sure.

1327
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,227
l've never been in a spot like this before.

1328
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,271
Sure gets your adrenaline going, doesn't it?

1329
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,065
Gets you all pumped up?

1330
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,858
l feel like we're making
some momentum now.

1331
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,235
l mean, they're snooping. We're moving.

1332
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,737
l'd like to try something new,

1333
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:23,490
rather than just
making statements all the time.

1334
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:26,451
A monologue, a soliloquy,
some shit like that.

1335
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,412
Maybe l just got
to reinvent myself a little bit.

1336
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:31,790
Reinvent yourself?
How do you reinvent yourself?

1337
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,541
That's deep acting stuff.

1338
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,668
lt's past Strasberg and...

1339
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,380
What's the Russian, the Russian...
This Russian guy.

1340
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,465
-The other method...
-Gretzky?

1341
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,509
Gretzky? That's hockey.

1342
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,636
Stanislavsky. That's it.

1343
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,471
Hockey. Gretzky.

1344
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:48,973
lt's not your fault.
You're not supposed to know anyway.

1345
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:52,602
lt's my backyard. l'm supposed to know.
lt just slipped my mind.

1346
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,187
The name slipped my mind.

1347
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,939
Stanislavsky. Yeah, it's deep.

1348
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:57,982
Worry about the camera.
You worry about the camera.

1349
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,901
Just get that camera right when l nail it,

1350
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,778
'cause l got them right now. l know l do.

1351
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,534
Fuck.

1352
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:11,538
l think those detectives are following me.

1353
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,998
Don't turn around.

1354
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,752
They're following me around now.

1355
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,338
So, l think the time has come.

1356
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:24,175
Yeah, what we're figuring is
we're going to get out of town a little bit.

1357
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,846
All right, look, meet me at
the Errol Flynn house at 8:30.

1358
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,181
Errol Flynn. Okay.

1359
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,352
Hey, William.

1360
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,688
You want a hot dog? l'll treat you.

1361
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,026
Let me have two dogs
and a coupIe of Iemonades.

1362
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,028
l don't want a... l don't want a lemonade.

1363
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,321
You don't want lemonade?

1364
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:48,116
No, no. My father, he gave me a lemonade

1365
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,245
when l was a little kid. He let me
stay up and watch Fright Night.

1366
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:57,041
You know, this might be
a good time to split up, Will.

1367
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,210
You and Lorraine?

1368
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,880
No, me and you.

1369
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:08,011
You see, if l get in the car and drive away,
those cops will follow me.

1370
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,263
You can just walk away, home free.

1371
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,390
No.

1372
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,810
They'll never find you.

1373
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,979
No.

1374
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:22,484
l feel responsible.
l mean l'm the one that got us into this.

1375
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,737
You shouldn't have to go through this.

1376
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,740
l started the S.O.S.

1377
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,039
That's right.

1378
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,625
l forgot. You're the founder.

1379
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,796
You sure?

1380
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,509
Yeah, l want to stay with you.

1381
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,846
Thanks.

1382
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,853
Hey, where'd you go for those dogs,
the ASPCA?

1383
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:01,773
Let's go. We got cops chasing us over here.

1384
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,775
Shake them up a little.

1385
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,611
They still there?

1386
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,949
These guys must know more
than they're letting on.

1387
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,993
They must not have enough, though.
They'd pull us over, right?

1388
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,454
Are you going to try and lose them?

1389
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,623
Yeah. We got to lose them.

1390
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,418
How do they lose those cops
in all those fucking movies?

1391
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,087
They always lose them.

1392
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,422
Wait, fuck. We just did. We just lost them.

1393
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:28,508
They're at the light.
They got caught in the light.

1394
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,886
lf l was a cop, l'd go through it.
Fucking dopes.

1395
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,674
So this is for the best, don't you think?

1396
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,929
l could've been good for this town.

1397
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,640
l think l could've been a hell of an actor.

1398
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:20,226
lt takes more than talent, Jimmy.

1399
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:25,023
l'm sorry l didn't take you dancing to Ciro's.

1400
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:29,611
l would've liked to have seen you
in a tuxedo, just once.

1401
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,864
lt would've been fantastic.

1402
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,953
lt's just a little too overwhelming.

1403
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,915
l don't know what l should do.

1404
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,710
Kiss you, hug you,

1405
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,046
or slap the shit out of you.

1406
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,424
l got to go.

1407
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,054
Go.

1408
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:20,787
l can't believe l didn't make it.

1409
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,414
l used to visualize
the people back east saying,

1410
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,292
"Remember Jimmy Alto?
We used to call him Jimmy Hollywood?

1411
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,587
"Went out to California and made it big."

1412
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,298
l just can't believe it.

1413
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:35,468
l really feel bad for Lorraine, you know.

1414
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:38,763
She had her heart set
on the whole beauty salon thing.

1415
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,848
With my contacts,

1416
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:44,435
she could've became
the first woman hairdresser to the stars.

1417
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:48,731
She could've been as big as
Christophe or Jose Eber, l mean...

1418
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,401
She had a great name for it, too,
don't you think?

1419
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:53,319
Lorraine De la Pena.

1420
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,280
Like Oscar De La Renta.

1421
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,079
At least Hollywood's
going to remember Jericho.

1422
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:07,792
l just wish they knew
that he was played by Jimmy Alto.

1423
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:14,132
-What do you make of this shit?
-l don't know.

1424
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:17,969
Hey, you think
this is that guy that got shot?

1425
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:21,013
l can't tell from here.

1426
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,640
l can't tell.

1427
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,353
What the fuck
am l going to do here, William?

1428
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:31,190
There might be other guys, other lowlifes.

1429
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:49,125
l knew l should've worn my seat belt.

1430
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,712
Motherfuckers!

1431
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,177
These guys are playing games.

1432
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,305
l hate guys who give me the high beams.

1433
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:40,760
What the hell was that all about, huh?

1434
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,180
You think it was that drug guy
we put in the bathtub?

1435
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,098
l don't know. l don't know.

1436
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,893
l mean, they obviously didn't know
we were the S.O.S., right?

1437
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:52,355
lmagine if we were just average citizens
and didn't know what to do.

1438
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,357
We could've got hurt.

1439
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,484
Why us? Out of the clear blue sky?

1440
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,154
lt just goes to show you, l mean, you know,
the craziness that's going on around here.

1441
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:01,614
lt's crazy.

1442
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:06,410
l don't think we can leave town just yet.

1443
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,373
First Jimmy Alto's got to go public.

1444
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:13,042
Before l leave town, l go public.

1445
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,710
One last hurrah.

1446
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:17,088
You think that's a good idea?

1447
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:18,589
Yeah.

1448
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,508
l mean, if you're going to take
a hit show off the air,

1449
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,051
you got to go out in style.

1450
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:24,929
You got to leave them
with some kind of a hook.

1451
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:30,393
Reveal the identity of Jericho.

1452
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:32,436
Jimmy Alto is Jericho.

1453
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,901
You know, if l'm going to
make my farewell speech,

1454
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,903
l'll need an appropriate setting.

1455
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:43,948
Something, someplace
that speaks Hollywood.

1456
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,159
The Hollywood Bowl, that's it.

1457
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,579
"Jimmy Alto at the Hollywood Bowl.
One night only."

1458
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,289
What do you think?

1459
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,165
The Hollywood Bowl.

1460
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,211
l mean, look at this. This is great.

1461
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,964
What are you gonna do?
You're going to find better than this?

1462
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,425
What the hell am l going to say?
What am l going to say?

1463
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,218
You know, let's face it, Will.

1464
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,596
You know, we actually did some good.

1465
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:11,100
You know? l mean, that was not
the purpose, but what the hell, huh?

1466
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:13,603
Crime is down.

1467
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,606
l forget how much, but it is down.

1468
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:20,109
Why was l going public?
l can't even remember the reason now.

1469
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,320
You think it was those drug guys
from the other time?

1470
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:23,905
l don't know. l don't know.

1471
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,449
lt's hard to tell the lunatics
from one another. l don't know.

1472
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:29,160
lt's insanity. What do you want, motives?

1473
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:31,621
lt's not like this is
Murder She Wrote William.

1474
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,915
l mean, there are no motives anymore.

1475
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,958
They could've just been playing games.
l don't know who they were.

1476
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:37,543
l mean, it's total insanity.

1477
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,670
You want to make logic out of insanity?

1478
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,964
What am l gonna say here?
l'm trying to think.

1479
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:43,883
ls today the 1 7th?

1480
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:45,676
l don't know. Why?

1481
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:49,055
'Cause l got my MRl
appointment on the 1 7th, you know?

1482
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,849
That's wonderful, Will.

1483
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:53,976
We have police closing in on us,

1484
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:57,063
lowlifes smashing into the car,
they shoot at us.

1485
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:59,398
And you're wondering
about your doctor's appointment?

1486
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,150
You'll probably get a bullet
in your fucking head

1487
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:04,028
before you get a chance to do your MRl.

1488
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,531
What am l going to say?
What the hell am l gonna say?

1489
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:09,367
What a time not to know what to say.

1490
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:12,787
l mean, l have a chance to say it right
here and be in everybody's living room,

1491
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:15,289
and l can't think of anything to say. Shit.

1492
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:17,667
Wait a minute. This is the 1 7th.

1493
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,835
Jimmy, this is the 1 7th!

1494
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,089
l got my appointment with the doctor
for my MRl thing today!

1495
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,050
William, we are leaving town!

1496
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,844
You understand
that we are getting out of town?

1497
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,888
l know, but it's going to take forever
to reschedule.

1498
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,307
Can't l just go do my MRl thing right now,

1499
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:36,352
then we could both
scoot out of town then?

1500
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,355
The sun's coming up.

1501
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:45,236
l want this speech to work
at the appropriate moment,

1502
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:49,323
like Easter Sunday services,
with that light just breaking through.

1503
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,505
What do you think? Are you sure?

1504
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,520
The vigiIante Jericho
has made his name known

1505
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,731
in the foIIowing videotape.

1506
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,275
HeIIo, Mr. and Mrs. HoIIywood.

1507
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,527
This is Jimmy AIto,

1508
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,946
better known to you as Jericho.

1509
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,574
lt's a very sad time for the S.O.S.

1510
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:33,868
The poIice are forcing us to Ieave town.

1511
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,038
l'll come back and pick you up.
What do you think? A couple of hours?

1512
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,372
l don't know. lt could be.

1513
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:42,043
l got the Sony Watchman and the
Hollywood and the Stars tapes,

1514
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,878
l'll just watch that. Okay? They're in here.

1515
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:46,547
-Be careful. Don't lose my tapes.
-l won't.

1516
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:56,057
It's just a matter of time
before they get me, but think about this.

1517
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,309
Look at the time and energy
the poIice are spending

1518
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,645
to find me and the members
of the S.O.S. A task force.

1519
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:05,066
But are we a threat
to the citizens of this city? No.

1520
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:10,154
Has the S.O.S. ever robbed or raped
or kiIIed citizens of this city? No.

1521
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:13,574
Is this same poIice energy
directed towards the S.O.S.

1522
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:17,244
aIso appIied to the criminaI eIement
of this city? No.

1523
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:21,665
PeopIe are afraid to go out at night
for fear of being robbed or kiIIed.

1524
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,543
Women are terrified
to go into underground parking garages

1525
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:26,337
for fear of being attacked.

1526
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:29,340
We're guaranteed,
in the DecIaration of Independence,

1527
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:32,093
Iife, Iiberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

1528
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:33,761
No, the police just left.

1529
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,846
The shit's reaIIy going to hit the fan now.

1530
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:38,933
-What are you talking about?
-Well, l've gone public.

1531
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:42,603
l made a video saying that
Jericho is really Jimmy Alto.

1532
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,688
No, don't tell me that.

1533
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:47,274
l can't talk now but l'm bigger than ever.
l've gone public.

1534
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,361
l'm defying them to come and get me.
That's what my message is.

1535
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,988
Jimmy, listen to me. Listen to me.

1536
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:56,117
l can't. l can't. l got to run.
The clock's ticking, honey.

1537
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,370
l'll call you
when l get wherever it is l'm going. Bye.

1538
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,039
Look what's happening
to the quaIity of our Iife.

1539
01:31:02,124 --> 01:31:04,041
What kind of Iiberty is it
when the innocent peopIe

1540
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:06,460
have to live behind bars
to protect themseIves?

1541
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:09,463
How can we pursue
our happiness when we Iive in fear?

1542
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,799
l think we could sue
the Government of the United States

1543
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:14,301
because our civiI rights are being vioIated.

1544
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:18,139
This is a society that is being strangIed
to death by the criminaI eIement.

1545
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:19,473
And what's being done?

1546
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:21,892
What is being done is
they're trying to get Jericho.

1547
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:23,811
They're trying to get the S.O.S.

1548
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:25,312
He's very convincing.

1549
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,481
Yeah, he's a good actor,

1550
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:29,817
but he's not a vigilante. That's the problem.

1551
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:31,569
He's not a vigilante?

1552
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:32,903
No.

1553
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:37,158
Police Chief Cummings had this to say
about the Jimmy AIto speech.

1554
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:40,161
I think this man Jimmy AIto
is missing the point.

1555
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,746
The reason we're trying to get him
as quickIy as possibIe

1556
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:45,249
is we can't aIIow anarchy on our streets.

1557
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,586
Anarchy? You got anarchy up the ass, pal.

1558
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:50,588
Anarchy with cappuccino.

1559
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:52,756
We cannot sanction that type of behavior.

1560
01:31:52,883 --> 01:31:54,925
What the hell's going on?

1561
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:57,761
At the present time,
there are over 150 poIicemen

1562
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,764
assigned to track down
Jimmy Alto and the S.O.S.

1563
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:02,766
Detectives on the speciaI task force

1564
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:06,437
estimate there are
50-75 members of the S.O.S.,

1565
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,857
and we believe them
to be heaviIy armed and dangerous.

1566
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:12,943
Excuse me. l must be a mirage.

1567
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:16,780
Excuse me.

1568
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:18,782
Do you know where l might find William?

1569
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:19,909
William who?

1570
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,536
William. Little guy. Got a hat on.
Head problems.

1571
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:24,914
He's here to see... He's getting an MRl.

1572
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,874
l must have a last name, sir.

1573
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,293
William, William. l don't know.

1574
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,296
l'm sorry. l must have a last name.

1575
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:34,965
William!

1576
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,634
William?

1577
01:32:40,597 --> 01:32:42,473
Aren't you Jimmy Alto?

1578
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:44,808
l just saw
your Jericho speech on the television.

1579
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:45,976
Oh, yeah?

1580
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:48,229
l think it's a wonderful thing you're doing.

1581
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,731
-Thank you.
-l'd love to have your autograph.

1582
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:54,568
-l don't have a pen.
-You're a hell of a guy, Jimmy Alto.

1583
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,070
l agree 1 00%.

1584
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,572
-What channel did you see it on?
-PBS.

1585
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,330
Jimmy.

1586
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:09,500
Where the hell you been?
l've been looking all over for you.

1587
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:10,793
When?

1588
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:13,671
-What do you mean "when"?
-l got you a root beer.

1589
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,470
Oh, shit. Look at this.

1590
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,068
lt's really dark in here.

1591
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:02,321
Where'd you get that?

1592
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:03,489
The car radio guy.

1593
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,324
Let me see that.

1594
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:08,911
What the hell building is this?

1595
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:11,372
Looks like a pyramid, don't it?

1596
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,791
Those look like Egyptian hieroglyphics.

1597
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,168
lsn't that where they bury mummies?

1598
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:17,961
Don't worry, Will.

1599
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:20,756
He's not even in Philadelphia yet.

1600
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:32,810
What do we do now?

1601
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:34,436
l don't know.

1602
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:37,523
The best thing to do is to wait till dark
and then we'll sneak out of here.

1603
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,235
Good afternoon.
Breaking news in HoIIywood.

1604
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,861
HoIIywood poIice
have surrounded the Egyptian theater...

1605
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:45,072
-Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
-...where they apparentIy have cornered

1606
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,574
the man who calls himself Jericho,

1607
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,785
who we now know is Jimmy AIto...

1608
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:54,790
-Did you bring my Hollywood tapes?
-Yeah.

1609
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,166
Get them out.

1610
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:58,627
The Egyptian theater
has been derelict for some time,

1611
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:01,713
so it's conceivable
it could be the S.O.S. Headquarters.

1612
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,716
We intend to cordon off the area and
make sure the situation is contained.

1613
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:06,385
Do you think
they could have explosives in there?

1614
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,429
...and there's been absoIuteIy no movement,

1615
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:10,639
but so far no shots have been fired.

1616
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:12,307
But we stiII don't know from poIice

1617
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:15,018
how many peopIe there are inside...

1618
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,104
Police have the situation
basicaIIy under controI.

1619
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:20,649
It's basicaIIy wait and see.
What wiII Jimmy AIto's next move be?

1620
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,568
As you can see
from the number of poIice here...

1621
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:26,655
For the hopefuIs who have flocked
to HoIIywood through the years,

1622
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:29,658
the studios were citadeIs to be conquered.

1623
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,494
Because there were so many who came

1624
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:34,788
hoping to succeed in pictures,

1625
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:38,041
the producers
hid themseIves from the onsIaught

1626
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,627
behind their bars and walls.

1627
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,465
From the outside,

1628
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:49,595
the studios can seem as bleak
and uninviting as fortresses.

1629
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,683
I think it takes a great deaI

1630
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:57,478
to withhold and withstand

1631
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:01,356
the mad competition that you do have

1632
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:04,318
and to not give up,

1633
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:07,112
because it's very easy to give up.

1634
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:11,700
There are roIes that you think
you're just are on the verge of getting,

1635
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:14,912
and then it turns out
they go to someone eIse.

1636
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:17,331
They stiII come,

1637
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,083
the young aspirants to HoIIywood success.

1638
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,294
One sees them like moths

1639
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:25,088
fluttering in the gIare of neon Iights.

1640
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,550
HoIIywood is a town in transition.

1641
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:32,513
HoIIywood promises to become
part of another supercity,

1642
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,390
Iike a Iot of supercities in America.

1643
01:37:36,976 --> 01:37:38,894
But the dream persists

1644
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,355
that there is stiII magic here.

1645
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:44,316
At night from a high buiIding or hiIItop,

1646
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,819
when the Iights of the city
are like beacons down below,

1647
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:50,239
the dream persists.

1648
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,539
Can the police estimate

1649
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:00,832
just how many members of the S.O.S.

1650
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:03,794
may be inside the theater at this point?

1651
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:07,130
WeII, HaI, if they can, they're certainIy
not giving us any information about that.

1652
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:09,550
Butjudging
from the manpower they have outside

1653
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:12,511
and the weapons they're carrying,
they're ready to take on an army.

1654
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:16,098
WeII, are they specuIating,
or couId you perhaps specuIate,

1655
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:19,226
on just how Iong
this standoff can last, Paul?

1656
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:22,896
Are the poIice considering
forcing their way into the buiIding?

1657
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:31,071
Great documentary, huh?

1658
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:32,906
Great documentary.

1659
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:44,459
Think l'm just gonna
have a look around a little bit.

1660
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:46,920
Rather quickIy, since earlier today,

1661
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:48,630
when this station received
the latest S.O.S. videotape...

1662
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:50,340
-Jimmy. Jimmy!
-What?

1663
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,092
You don't have to go take a look around.

1664
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,927
-What?
-lt's all right here.

1665
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:56,722
-What are you talking about?
-There's, like, a million cops out there.

1666
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:59,683
Jimmy AIto, an unempIoyed actor
who Iives in HoIIywood...

1667
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,894
Holy shit! All those people are out there?

1668
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,229
Yeah.

1669
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:07,316
So much for sneaking out
inconspicuously tonight, huh?

1670
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,109
...have secured the buiIding.

1671
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:11,737
-We've also received word...
-Yes! Look at this, Will.

1672
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:13,238
Fans. They're our fans.

1673
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:14,698
...covering aII possibIe exits
from the theater.

1674
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,783
One thing l want to point out to you
when you see it,

1675
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:20,162
aII these peopIe out here,
it's Iike an oId HoIIywood premiere.

1676
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:21,330
They're a fan club.

1677
01:39:21,414 --> 01:39:24,708
The police want Jericho,
or Jimmy Alto, in custody.

1678
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:27,419
These people want to applaud him.

1679
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:30,839
ln Hollywood,
we have the hyphenate of actor/writer,

1680
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,633
producer/director.

1681
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,635
Well, now we have a new hyphenate,

1682
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,720
actor/vigilante.

1683
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,222
Jimmy Alto, we know him as Jericho...

1684
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:42,476
Well, there's still a tremendous amount
of police activity here...

1685
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,395
Special weapons
and tactics team continue to...

1686
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,314
l want to ask about this new information,

1687
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,900
that Jericho may actually be an actor.

1688
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,778
Well, as far as l'm concerned,
he's a vigilante.

1689
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,238
lf he's an actor,
he's playing on the wrong stage.

1690
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:59,284
We've managed to obtain a video
of Jimmy AIto's taped audition...

1691
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:01,787
Look, look, look.
They got your audition tape.

1692
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,414
-ApparentIy, he did not get the part.
-Let me see that beauty.

1693
01:40:04,499 --> 01:40:08,251
-They're showing it on television?
-Let's take a Iook at that audition tape.

1694
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,045
What are you saying, I can't?

1695
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:11,421
Because l'll kill him.

1696
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:13,590
This one l did better in another scene.

1697
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:15,217
Why'd they put that take in there?

1698
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:17,177
-He's not dangerous.
-Think you can get him out here?

1699
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:18,345
He's just an actor.

1700
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:20,263
PoIice have apparentIy persuaded
Jimmy AIto's girlfriend,

1701
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:25,394
Lorraine De Ia Pena, to negotiate with AIto,
in hopes of coaxing the S.O.S. leader

1702
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:27,229
-out of the theater peacefuIIy.
-Jimmy AIto!

1703
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,857
-Jimmy! This is the poIice.
-Look here. You're looking up at the ceiling.

1704
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:34,236
We have Lorraine out here, out in front.

1705
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,738
She wants to talk to you.

1706
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:39,700
l'd better get out there. Watch on this.

1707
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,660
Stay here, just in case.

1708
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,912
She is now walking up
to the front doors of the theater...

1709
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:44,996
Hey, Lorraine.

1710
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:57,843
l think it would be good if we talked.

1711
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,303
Come on in. The show's about to begin.

1712
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:10,063
Look what happened?
How the hell did you end up here?

1713
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:14,067
Well, William's MRl took a little
longer than we thought it would,

1714
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:16,903
and, l don't know,
one thing led to another, and...

1715
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:19,448
Yes, one thing leads to another,
but not to this.

1716
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:24,494
This building is surrounded.

1717
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:27,122
-Yeah?
-Yeah. lt's like an army out there.

1718
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,754
Hollywood Boulevard's
really happening, huh?

1719
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,298
You have to come out.

1720
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:39,384
Hey, did you see
they showed my audition tape

1721
01:41:39,469 --> 01:41:42,596
-on television from Urban Nomad?
-Yes.

1722
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,556
l thought it was pretty good.
What'd you think?

1723
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,266
Yes, Jimmy. Very good.

1724
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:49,811
You know, they used to show
classic movies in this place.

1725
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,856
Let's get William, and we'll go out together.

1726
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,107
Okay?

1727
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:56,943
l'm not going to give up, Lorraine.

1728
01:41:57,028 --> 01:42:00,155
Not now. This is the greatest role of my life.

1729
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:02,616
You've got to know how crazy this is.

1730
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,785
Jimmy, they will kill you.

1731
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:07,078
They ready.

1732
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,916
l'll never get another role
as good as Jericho.

1733
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,751
Nothing this good.

1734
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,711
You never know.

1735
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,006
l do know.

1736
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,926
l'm a one-role actor.

1737
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:23,011
Brando...

1738
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:25,055
He's an actor.

1739
01:42:25,807 --> 01:42:29,309
Stanley Kowalski, Streetcar Named Desire.

1740
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:32,229
Terry Malloy, On the Waterfront.

1741
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:34,815
The Godfather.

1742
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,862
l don't have that in me.

1743
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:43,448
Think of it this way, Jimmy.

1744
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:45,742
Look at all the attention you're getting.

1745
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:48,703
And the charges against you
probably won't be that great.

1746
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:50,997
You'll be out in a couple of years,

1747
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:53,083
and you'll be acting for sure.

1748
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:54,918
This is the role. l'm going to play it out.

1749
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,254
You've played it out, Jimmy.

1750
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:58,713
lt's over.

1751
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,007
No, it's not over.

1752
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:03,343
Every great role has a great ending.

1753
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:05,804
l am not going to cheat that.

1754
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:10,892
l want you to take William out with you.

1755
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:12,602
-William!
-Yeah.

1756
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:13,770
Come here.

1757
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:18,400
-What happened?
-l want you to do me a favor.

1758
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:21,486
Lorraine, we saw you on the little TV here.
You looked good.

1759
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:23,613
You look very photogenic.

1760
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:26,825
Will, l want you to leave with Lorraine.

1761
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,077
You think that's a good idea?

1762
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:31,621
Yeah, l do. l want you to leave.

1763
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:33,081
Okay.

1764
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:50,390
Whatever happened to those
big romantic Hollywood endings?

1765
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:55,770
l don't know.

1766
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,779
-Will, you got to leave me these guns.
-Okay.

1767
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,907
l need this. This, too.

1768
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:17,918
Hey.

1769
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:20,462
Hey, it's okay.

1770
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:24,049
The mummy's going to stay with me.
You're safe.

1771
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:30,555
Okay?

1772
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:32,807
Okay.

1773
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,913
Hey, Jimmy, can you see me?

1774
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,539
l'm on TV!

1775
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:07,425
We're not sure, though, who the man is,
apparently one of the members of the S.O.S.

1776
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:10,637
There appears to be
some sort of negotiation taking pIace.

1777
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:14,641
They're apparentIy getting demands
from someone inside the Egyptian theater.

1778
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:24,317
ApparentIy, Jimmy AIto
came out to Los AngeIes

1779
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:27,028
from the New Jersey area
about seven years ago.

1780
01:45:27,113 --> 01:45:29,072
He was an aIuminum siding saIesman,

1781
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:31,449
as weII as being invoIved
in kitchen remodeIing,

1782
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:34,786
but decided
that acting was his caIIing in Iife.

1783
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:38,123
It's a very interesting situation

1784
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:39,541
because he's acting out this part.

1785
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,626
And we're not exactIy sure
how it's going to end

1786
01:45:41,711 --> 01:45:44,921
because he's writing the script.
It's in his hands at this point.

1787
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:00,270
What are you going to do, kiII me?

1788
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,938
Everybody dies.

1789
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:05,775
What are you going to do, kiII me?

1790
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,444
Everybody dies.

1791
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,659
What are you going to do, kill me?

1792
01:46:15,036 --> 01:46:17,537
Everybody dies.

1793
01:46:17,663 --> 01:46:18,830
Fuck!

1794
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:22,125
What are you going to do, kill me?

1795
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:23,668
Fuck!

1796
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:26,087
Kill me?

1797
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:28,882
Shit!

1798
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:31,176
What are you going to do...

1799
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,720
What are you going to do, kill me?

1800
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:35,930
Everybody dies.

1801
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:38,099
Fuck!

1802
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,560
What are you going to do, kill me?

1803
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,937
Everybody dies.

1804
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:52,614
Everybody dies.
Everybody dies. Everybody dies.

1805
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,284
Everybody dies. Everybody dies.

1806
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:09,839
l'm coming out!

1807
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:15,720
Keep your hands above your head
in pIain sight and waIk.

1808
01:47:15,805 --> 01:47:17,764
l don't have any guns. See?

1809
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:21,309
Nothing in the front of me.
Nothing in the back of me.

1810
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:23,186
Take him down!

1811
01:47:53,384 --> 01:47:55,051
Jericho is dead.

1812
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:59,806
Perhaps the most infamous vigiIante
this country has ever known...

1813
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,559
And a mighty fine actor, I might add.

1814
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:06,312
I was just a Iost kid on the bouIevard
untiI Jimmy saved me.

1815
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:08,898
He truIy is a genius,
what eIse can you say? He's a genius.

1816
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:12,902
He's a genius in a town
that doesn't embrace geniuses.

1817
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,905
To you, you may have kiIIed a vigiIante,

1818
01:48:16,574 --> 01:48:18,575
but for me, you kiII

1819
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,577
the Iove of my Iife.

1820
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:24,080
You may have cut short potentiaIIy one
of the great acting taIents of aII time.

1821
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,374
l think we can all mourn that loss.

1822
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:29,460
Jericho! Jericho! Jericho!

1823
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,825
What are they going to do, kill me?
Everybody dies.

1824
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:05,932
l'm coming out!

1825
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:10,019
Keep your hands above your head
in pIain sight and waIk.

1826
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:12,188
l don't have any guns. See?

1827
01:50:12,273 --> 01:50:13,523
Nothing in the front of me,
nothing in the back...

1828
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:15,692
-Everybody down!
-Gun shield!

1829
01:51:03,532 --> 01:51:05,700
Who was that, James Cagney?

1830
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:08,828
l had to tell them.

1831
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:11,080
l forgot l told you l had blanks.

1832
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:14,542
Some vigilante, huh?

1833
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:16,085
Think of it this way.

1834
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:18,921
ln Hollywood, they always use blanks.

1835
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,215
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

1836
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:22,884
Blanks.

1837
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:24,594
Hollywood.

1838
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,525
We now go to PauI Jackson
outside the Egyptian theater.

1839
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:43,613
PauI, has Jimmy AIto
ever worked as an actor out here?
