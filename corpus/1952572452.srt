1
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,442
Yes, boss, I have
the satellite codes with me.

2
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:53,052
No, I didn't leave them in the truck.
You think I'm stupid?

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,584
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,056
No, they are with me.

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,021
<i>Ja, I'm inputting them right now.</i>

6
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,755
Yeah, I'm working very hard.
Say hello to your wife.

7
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,126
Oh, she left you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, bye.

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,634
Little puppy.

9
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,906
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,980
It's so cold.

11
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,412
Come inside and warm up with Freidrich.

12
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,779
Come here. Yes.

13
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,821
Hello. Hello.

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,926
Rex?

15
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,891
I found a new companion for you.

16
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,590
Say hi to your new friend. "Hello."

17
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,271
"I'm your new friend. We are friends."

18
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,098
Rex!

19
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,138
Stop it! It's only a little puppy.

20
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,910
Now you sound angry.

21
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,978
Stop it! He can hear you!

22
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,672
Close your mouth.

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,614
No! Rex! This is so illogical!

24
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,346
Rex! Rex, what's wrong with you?

25
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,649
Come. Come. Outside. No!

26
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,689
Where are your manners?
Sit! Sit! Sit down! We have a guest.

27
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,593
You will stay out here
till you learn how to behave!

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,470
Oh, no. Locked?

29
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,842
But how?

30
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,224
Meow.

31
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>State your business.</i>

32
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,976
Agent 127 breaking radio silence.

33
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,815
I have spotted Kitty Galore.

34
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,550
I repeat, I have spotted Kitty Galore.

35
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,620
We've all seen his commercials...

36
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,460
...but today it appears Crazy Carlito
really is off his rocker.

37
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,793
He's claimed his prices are insane.
Now it appears he is too.

38
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:43,271
The situation is tense as we wait
for someone to come end this standoff.

39
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,553
Shane, get over here.

40
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,992
Diggs, stay.

41
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,728
Give me the situation, captain.

42
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,598
We've got a first-class nutcase here.

43
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,830
Four hostages inside.

44
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,736
All used-car salesmen.

45
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,437
I've got mixed feelings about this one.

46
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,777
That wacko so much as
changes channels on that thing...

47
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,441
...and this whole lot explodes.

48
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,885
Only one thing to do here.

49
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,617
You are mine. You are so mine.

50
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,887
Yeah.

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,756
I'll do it!
- All I can...

52
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,800
Come any closer
and the last thing you'll hear is "boom"!

53
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,064
Diggs. No.

54
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,433
Diggs!

55
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,632
Get out of there! Get out!

56
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,209
- Get out!
- Guys, let's go!

57
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,572
Get out of there! Diggs!

58
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,043
Diggs, go, go!

59
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,481
You want fireworks,
I'll show you fireworks!

60
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,978
All I have to do is push this button...

61
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,917
...and boom!

62
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,334
Oh, yeah!

63
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,562
Diggs! No!

64
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,173
It's gonna blow!
Hold those people back!

65
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,603
Uh-oh.

66
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,802
Take cover! I repeat! Take cover!

67
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,448
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

68
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,855
You wanna recruit that guy?
He just blew up a car dealership!

69
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,759
A used-car dealership.
True, he may not be a great cop.

70
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,765
But he has the potential
to be a great agent.

71
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,099
He's fearless, barks in the face of danger,
and is trained in paw-to-paw combat.

72
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,366
Plus the only thing he hates more
than following orders...

73
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,770
...is cats.

74
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,302
Well, hating cats is good.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,846
And exactly what we need
to take down Kitty Galore.

76
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,314
Fine. But I don't know who you'll find
dumb enough to partner with him.

77
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,351
Easy. I'm barking right at him.

78
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,120
Woof.

79
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,794
- Suspended?
- This dog is a disaster.

80
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,229
We've sent him to obedience school,
what, three times now?

81
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,237
And he still won't listen.

82
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't put him back in the system.

83
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,915
He's been in and out of kennels
his whole life. He's never had a home.

84
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,684
I'll tell you what, I will adopt him.

85
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,320
Sorry, Shane. He's state property.

86
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,581
Besides, you have a new baby now.

87
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,193
You don't need this kind of trouble
at home. Let him go, Shane.

88
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,692
Let him go.

89
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,387
Captain, please don't make me do this.

90
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,303
Nice one, Diggs.

91
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,644
I'm sorry, Diggs.

92
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,239
I know you tried.

93
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,473
You always try.
Just sometimes a little too hard.

94
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,018
Like this cop thing.

95
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,883
Sometimes you just
gotta play with others.

96
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,489
It's not always about being the top dog.

97
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,930
Diggs, I'm sorry, buddy.

98
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,880
I'll do everything I can
to get you out of here.

99
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,579
Until then, you be a good boy.

100
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,453
I love you, buddy.

101
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,093
This isn't so bad, right?

102
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,263
How's it going, floor? What's up, cage?

103
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,738
<i>Que pasa, bowl?</i>

104
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,809
Did you guys miss me?
Because I'm back!

105
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,906
Back in the kennel again.

106
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,747
Hey! What...? What the...?

107
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,655
Okay, okay, this is creeping me out.

108
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,759
Hello? Anyone home?

109
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,121
Hello?

110
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,865
Whoa.

111
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,594
Uh-oh.

112
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,465
Who are you?
When did they put an elevator in there?

113
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,511
Name's Special Agent Butch,
and against better judgment...

114
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,944
...you're being recruited
into an organization...

115
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,311
...to help fight the spread
of radical felinism.

116
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,510
Okay, is somebody pulling my tail here?

117
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,552
This isn't a joke, Diggs.

118
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,623
- How do you know my name?
- I just came up out of the floor.

119
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,056
Let's assume I'm smart enough
to know your name.

120
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,356
While you and your cop buddies
are here chasing your tails...

121
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,898
...there's an elite team of dogs
charged with the noble responsibility...

122
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,501
...of protecting mankind.

123
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,195
We want you to join that team.

124
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,899
This is a one-time-only offer, Diggs.
I suggest you say yes.

125
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,473
It's tempting, but I can't just say yes
to every offer that comes through that floor.

126
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:25,048
Kid, you already spent half your life
locked up in this place.

127
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,186
There's a good chance you'll spend
the rest of your life here.

128
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,685
But the choice is yours.

129
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,517
You can stay here and fight roaches
over your kibble...

130
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,887
...or you can come with me
and fight cats.

131
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,926
Fight cats? Why didn't you say so?

132
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,394
Now, move over, Rover,
this dog's ready to hunt!

133
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,758
Oh, my dog!

134
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,767
I just vacuumed the seats,
so try not to shed.

135
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,067
Come on!

136
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,209
Wow, we're going really fast, aren't we?

137
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,777
This is nice! This is enjoyable.
I'm enjoying this.

138
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,006
Sure you're okay, big shot?
Fine, good.

139
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,775
No, not good. Not good.

140
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,282
Yeah, I'm gonna barf.

141
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,684
<i>This is Agent 3293.
I've got the package.</i>

142
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:22,374
Careful, now. New recruits sometimes get
a little woozy after their first ride.

143
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,873
Are you okay there, rookie?

144
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,572
Yeah, I'm good. Totally fine.

145
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,083
I'm just gonna lay down here
till the room stops spinning.

146
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,380
Let's go, superdog.
The fun's just beginning.

147
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,285
I think we have different
definitions of "fun."

148
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,652
Just wait.

149
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,293
Now prepare yourself, kid.

150
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,989
You're about to experience something
no human and very few canines ever see.

151
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,226
<i>Greetings, Agent Butch.
Activate paw scan now.</i>

152
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,677
Whoa.

153
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,986
Sweet!

154
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,714
This is like Petco meets Vegas.

155
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,258
<i>Today's
seminar, "Harassment in the Workplace."</i>

156
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,190
<i>Doberman or not, do not pinch her.</i>

157
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,959
Welcome to Dog HQ,
the nexus of our whole operation.

158
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,625
Mike, you wanna grab lunch?
I don't like you, Carl.

159
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,264
We're the thin, furry line
between humans and total chaos.

160
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,500
Try and keep up, kid.

161
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,804
Hey, guys, watch.
I'm skateboarding, I'm skateboarding!

162
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,513
Our elite agents work and train 24/7...

163
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,811
...to combat all enemies,
foreign and domesticated.

164
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,149
We take the saying "man's best friend"
very seriously here.

165
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,551
All in?
Why not?

166
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,783
- Hey, Butch.
- Hey, Slim.

167
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,621
Why do we do all this?

168
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,526
To make sure it never becomes
a cat-eat-dog world out there.

169
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,304
Oh, hello, ladies!

170
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,666
Hate to see you go,
love to watch you leave.

171
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,038
Stop drooling already. Come on,
I want to introduce you to someone.

172
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,145
Could you introduce me
to them, please?

173
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,871
Hey, wait up.

174
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,082
Hot dog, coming through!

175
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,045
Three, two, one. Fire the catapult.

176
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,245
Bull's-eye.

177
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,721
Hey, watch your paws in here.
Don't touch anything.

178
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,154
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

179
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,529
Meow. Meow. Meow, meow.
Meow, meow, meow.

180
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,324
It's some kind of cat! Get back!

181
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,934
Meow? Oh, I forgot.
This is the Catamatron 3000.

182
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,964
It trains you to think
like the enemy. Literally.

183
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,436
Someone's been playing fetch
with the ugly stick.

184
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,371
This is Peek, tech specialist
and head of Covert Ops.

185
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,441
- Hi.
- What up, dog?

186
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,515
So, Peek, you got anything
that actually works?

187
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,109
Follow me.

188
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,877
Alley-oop.

189
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,421
Butch, your collar is fitted with
the Rawhide-7 communications package.

190
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,957
Lock pick, netting, helium-neon laser...

191
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,721
...grappling hook
and liver-scented breath freshener.

192
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,857
And this is yours.

193
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,023
Sweet! What's it do?

194
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,735
Holds your name tag on your neck.

195
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,462
Butch, you've lost some weight.

196
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,971
Sorry, my name's Diggs
and I always look this good.

197
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,234
Sam. I'm over here.

198
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,238
Sorry. The boss wants
to see you two pronto.

199
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,046
Get a haircut, you hippie.

200
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,349
<i>Congratulations, Agent Buttercup...</i>

201
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,976
<i>... on the birth of your son, son, daughter,
son, daughter, daughter...</i>

202
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,487
<i>... son, daughter, son.</i>

203
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,890
Have a seat, gentlemen.

204
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,295
No, off. Off the couch.

205
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,765
- Off the couch!
- Sorry. Sorry.

206
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,905
You guys were outside,
and you're dirty.

207
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,630
Because we're field agents, Lou.

208
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,436
We can't all be desk jockeys like you,
sitting around wearing ugly sweaters.

209
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,409
Hey, I like this sweater.
It was a gift from my grandma.

210
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,009
Can you give it back?

211
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,444
So you're the dog
who likes to blow up buildings.

212
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,611
Yeah, that was an accident.

213
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,121
You seem to have
a lot of accidents, Diggs.

214
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,124
Can we just cut to the chase already
and get to why I'm here?

215
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,525
Of course. Three hours ago,
we intercepted this transmission...

216
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,633
...from a mysterious villain
from the feline underworld.

217
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,270
We believe this was meant for all cats.

218
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,862
Take a look.

219
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,311
<i>Greetings, my future feline followers.</i>

220
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,745
<i>My name is Kitty Galore.</i>

221
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,183
Is that even a cat?

222
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,881
<i>And may I present the most adorable
creature in my life, little Scrumptious.</i>

223
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,548
<i>- Say hello, darling.
- Help me.</i>

224
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,297
<i>The age of the dog as man's
so-called "best friend" is over!</i>

225
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,903
<i>In two days, I will unleash a sound
only those droolbag dogs can hear.</i>

226
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,538
<i>A sound so devastating, so terrifying...</i>

227
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,675
<i>... it will drive all dogs completely insane.</i>

228
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:55,240
<i>I call this sound the Call of the Wild!</i>

229
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,140
<i>Once the dogs go woo-hoo, humans will
be forced to get rid of them...</i>

230
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,380
<i>... and without their protection,
I will enslave all mankind!</i>

231
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,851
<i>Kitty! I'm home!</i>

232
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,860
<i>Nothing will stop me from
ruling the world. Kitty Galore out!</i>

233
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,498
That cat makes the hair on my butt
stand up.

234
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,567
Kitty has been number one
on our "most wanted" list for a year.

235
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,672
Last week, she and her henchcat, Paws,
resurfaced in Germany...

236
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,673
...and stole top-secret satellite codes.

237
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:29,746
Our sources also tell us Paws recently
tried to eliminate this pigeon, Seamus.

238
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,008
<i>I believe I can fly</i>

239
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,744
<i>I believe I can touch the sky</i>

240
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,054
<i>Can't a bird take a bath
without it ending up on the Internet?</i>

241
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,683
We don't know what the connection is,
but Seamus is our only link to Kitty.

242
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,559
We find him, he can lead us to her.
We have less than two days to find Kitty...

243
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,201
...before she activates her
Call of the Wild.

244
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,065
Your mission:
Fetch and retrieve that bird.

245
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,105
Easy enough. Just give me some bread,
a big net and a hammer.

246
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,640
We need him alive.

247
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,804
Okay, scratch the hammer.

248
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:04,915
So you have your assignment.
Find Seamus before the cats do.

249
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,484
You let Seamus get away?

250
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,894
It's just impossible to find
good help these days.

251
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:23,125
That rat with wings has vital information
that could destroy my entire plan.

252
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,635
We cannot let that happen, now,
can we, little Scrumptious?

253
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,134
Paws!

254
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,742
What are you waiting for?

255
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,743
I want this pigeon Seamus
in your mouth...

256
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,814
...on my doorstep immediately.

257
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,746
Out! I said out!

258
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,408
Out! Out! Out!

259
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,953
What's wrong with this stupid mouse?
Oh!

260
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,489
Oh, Scrumptious.

261
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,684
Now, now, I barely crushed you.

262
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:54,162
Think how lucky you are. You could be
living in that jungle instead of our new lair.

263
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,460
Isn't this wonderful?

264
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,993
It's perfect.

265
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,798
Kitty! I'm home!

266
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,941
Almost perfect.

267
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,139
Oh, look! Kitty! You think those
are real fishies, don't you?

268
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,217
That's adorable.

269
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,079
Great news.

270
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,224
We are headliners!

271
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:26,393
Would you believe it was only two months
ago when I walked in here to find you...?

272
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,196
Oh.

273
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,233
I see what you're thinking.

274
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,667
A new opening, right?

275
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,342
Of course! That's genius. Pure genius.

276
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,205
Now we...

277
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,019
You are excited! Every magician needs
one of these. Oh, yes.

278
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,379
Oh, yes.

279
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,058
Oh, Kitty.

280
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,359
<i>This is the rendezvous point.</i>

281
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,834
<i>The pigeon
we're looking for flew into that building.</i>

282
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,940
Now, remember what Lou said:
Follow my lead.

283
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:14,010
When I say "Wag your tail,"
you ask "How hard?" Got it?

284
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,647
What's with the fanny pack?
Shh!

285
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,426
We can stop playing games, boy.
I know you don't want none of this.

286
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,755
You don't wanna come out.
You hiding because you don't want the:

287
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,595
Now, watch this maneuver, kid.

288
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,473
I call it "Fetch a Stick."

289
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,448
- Hm?
Come on. Come on. Go get it.

290
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,015
Let's go.

291
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,748
Ha-ha. Sucker.

292
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,723
I don't know why,
but this building appeals to me.

293
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,829
Of course it does.
It looks like a giant fire hydrant.

294
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,829
Yep, that's it.

295
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,328
This would go faster
if you didn't watch me.

296
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,062
Come on, hurry up!

297
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,730
By the time you're done,
the bird will have flown.

298
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,773
Say hello to my little friend.

299
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,521
It's quiet. A little too quiet.

300
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,660
Butch, it's time to take out the trash!

301
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,621
What are you doing?

302
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,665
Where do you think you're going, punk?

303
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,429
Hey! Hey! Easy! Easy! Watch the teeth!

304
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,768
Stand down! That bird's
our informant. He works for us.

305
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,534
Informant? Work?
I do neither of these things.

306
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,339
- And when's the last time you had a mint?
- You Seamus?

307
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,507
That is privileged information.
Who wants to know?

308
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,711
Are you kidding me? Dog HQ sent us
to protect you. Now, let's go.

309
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,446
Good. It's about...

310
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,318
Wait a second!

311
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,519
How do I know
you don't work for the cats?

312
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,630
"The crow flies at midnight."

313
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,699
What? What crow?
What's he talking about?

314
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,803
That's the passphrase.
And you answer with, "The eagle..."

315
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,131
"Owes me five bucks."

316
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,537
- Ugh. Close enough.
No, no, wait. Hang on, I'll get it.

317
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,638
- Was it a penguin?
- I just told you it was an eagle!

318
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,576
- "Is a ballerina."
- All right, enough.

319
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,080
Why does Kitty Galore
have a price on your beak?

320
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,381
I don't know! I never met her!
That was my cousin Nicky's business.

321
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,580
Kitty wouldn't be after you
if you didn't know something.

322
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,920
Nicky just crashed at my pad sometimes.
I don't know anything.

323
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,618
My brain is the size of a grape!

324
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,990
Or a raisin. A big raisin or a little grape.

325
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,064
Don't get your feathers all ruffled.

326
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,928
You're completely safe, now that we're...

327
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,399
- Uh!
- Oh!

328
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,070
Look out!
Assassin with a rolled-up newspaper!

329
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,675
No sweat. It's just a little kitty cat.

330
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,572
Hand over the bird.

331
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,014
Ooh. A girl kitty cat.

332
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,943
I'm gonna enjoy this.

333
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,216
Hey, hey!

334
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:18,854
What the...?

335
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,597
- Oh, now it is on, furball!
Diggs!

336
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,728
- Protect the bird. I'll take the cat.
- You protect the bird. That cat's all mine.

337
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,342
You can both have the cat.
I'm out of here!

338
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,173
I told you to watch the bird!

339
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,139
See you, ladies. I gotta fly!

340
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,374
Hey!
- Whoa.

341
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,290
You always do it your way,
don't you, hotshot?

342
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,759
You're right, I should have seen
a flying cat coming. What the...?

343
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,442
No way! Did your backpack
just turn into a jet?

344
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,340
Diggs! Hang tight!
I'm going after that bird!

345
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,003
Not without me!

346
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,185
Oh, no!
- Hey! What the...?

347
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,291
Stop it! I can't see!
Billboard, billboard, billboard!

348
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,760
I'm too old for this poop!

349
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,697
Wait! I have a dozen eggs
waiting for me at home.

350
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,099
You can have six of them.

351
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,838
Oh, no!

352
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,999
Follow me through this, cat!

353
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,008
Careful what you wish for.

354
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,739
I didn't mean follow me for real,
I was playing.

355
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,811
Float like a butterfly, sting like a pi... Ah!

356
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,180
Mayday, mayday!

357
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,519
I've got you, bird.

358
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,171
Come on, Miss Daisy,
can't this thing go any faster?

359
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,865
This is only built for one, rookie!

360
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,570
Hide me, my brothers!

361
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,778
You're not gonna lose me that easy.

362
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,884
What you doing?
- It's the end of the line, bird!

363
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,183
- I'm almost on top of her!
No, I got her!

364
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,382
Hey! Are you crazy?

365
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,858
Hey, a squirrel.

366
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,234
Oh, boy. This is not good.

367
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,915
Can't fly too well with
a broken wing, can you?

368
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,214
Ouch.

369
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,522
Oh, my wing. Oh, that doesn't look right.

370
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,494
Collar: Net!

371
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:15,203
You busted my favorite wing.
Get ready for a lawsuit, lady. Ha!

372
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,646
- Mom, Mom, look at me.
Wow.

373
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,579
You're going really fast, kiddo.

374
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,150
We've been at this all night.

375
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,584
Now, for the last time,
where's Kitty Galore?

376
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,245
I don't know!

377
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,415
No! No!

378
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,220
Don't like the water, huh?

379
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,884
Anything but water! I beg you.

380
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,328
Diggs, that is not a valid
interrogation technique.

381
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,298
Back off, Butch.
This is how we do things downtown.

382
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,405
Think I'm gonna fall for your
"good dog, bad dog" routine?

383
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,541
- Human!
Hide. Hide. Hide.

384
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,433
Hey, doggies.

385
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,975
Ew. Ugh, yuck.

386
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,919
Guys, question: Why is butt-sniffing
always your fallback position?

387
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,612
Hey, don't knock it
till you've sniffed it. Now, talk!

388
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,582
No, no more water! No more...

389
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,192
<i>Agent 47?
Tab?</i>

390
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,658
<i>- We're getting...
- Can you hear me?</i>

391
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,228
<i>Have you been compromised?</i>

392
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,264
Aw, man. Where'd you get one of those
fancy collars?

393
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,096
"Agent"? Wait. If you're not working
for Kitty Galore, who are you?

394
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,039
Name's Catherine. I'm with MEOWS.

395
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,868
MEOWS? Collar: Laser.

396
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,010
Wait! Hold on, hold on. What's MEOWS?

397
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,809
Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety.
Feline intelligence.

398
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,112
Feline intelligence, huh?
Okay, quick, what's eight times eight?

399
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,152
- Sixty-four.
- Ha! Wrong!

400
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,123
It's eight, carry the three,
move the two...

401
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,157
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

402
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,321
MEOWS protects the world's cats
against the pooch peril.

403
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,592
- That's you, Rover.
- Human!

404
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,192
Hide. Hide. Hide.

405
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,132
Can't you doggies do anything else?

406
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,167
Ugh. Why is this always
our fallback position?

407
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,145
You weren't hired by Kitty Galore
to find the bird?

408
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,907
Wrong again, fleabag.

409
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,848
My mission is to find her
and take her down.

410
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,887
See, Kitty Galore, a.k.a. Ivana Clawyu...

411
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,582
...was one of MEOWS' best agents
until a year ago.

412
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,021
No. Don't come any closer.

413
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,458
<i>She was on assignment
at a cosmetics factory...</i>

414
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,861
<i>... when a guard dog chased her
into a vat of hair-removal cream.</i>

415
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,705
<i>Hairless beyond recognition
and humiliated by her fellow agents...</i>

416
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,849
<i>... Ivana left MEOWS
and returned to her home.</i>

417
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,518
What is that hideous thing?
It's freaking out the dog! Get that thing out!

418
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,754
Scram!

419
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,159
But it's Christmas.

420
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,728
I'll make them pay.

421
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,928
After that, she went rogue,
changed her name to Kitty Galore...

422
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,596
...and has been bent on revenge
ever since.

423
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,733
Wait. If she wants to destroy all dogs,
why are you trying to stop her?

424
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,472
Contrary to your belief,
all cats aren't evil.

425
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,707
We care about humans
as much as you do.

426
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:17,821
Kitty wants revenge on dogs and humans,
and that is why she must be stopped.

427
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,587
- Hey, doggies.
- What is wrong with you, kid?

428
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,786
How many times can you go down
the same slide?

429
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,799
I'm sorry. I mean... I mean coo.

430
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,765
Mommy! Mommy!

431
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,130
We've been compromised.

432
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,432
Unless you turn into a parrot,
never talk in front of humans!

433
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,476
Listen, I know Kitty. She's coming
after this bird, and you'll need my help.

434
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,443
Sorry, Agent LicksAIot, no cats allowed.

435
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,014
Something we agree on.

436
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,981
You guys don't have a choice.
Just try and stop me.

437
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,724
Hello?

438
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,631
<i>Officer Larson, this is Officer Raymond.</i>

439
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,965
<i>- Your K-9 partner, Diggs, is missing.
- What?</i>

440
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,267
<i>During today's rounds, his cage
was vacant. He seems to be lost.</i>

441
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,704
How do you lose Diggs?

442
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,744
<i>He's not officially lost.
We're filing the appropriate papers.</i>

443
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,815
Go back and check for him.
He didn't fall through the floor!

444
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,348
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

445
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,621
Sorry, honey, I'll be back.
Diggs is missing.

446
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,358
<i>Today's specials
are leftover meatloaf and bacon.</i>

447
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,998
<i>Bacon! Bacon! Bacon!</i>

448
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,863
Follow me, cat. For your own good,
I suggest you avoid sudden moves.

449
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,871
<i>The 7 p.m. Screening of Scooby-Doo
is now sold out. Tickets still available...</i>

450
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,474
<i>Wait! Is that a cat?</i>

451
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,007
Hm?

452
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,769
Why is everybody looking at me...

453
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,507
...like they've never seen a crippled pigeon
riding on a dusty dog?

454
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,648
Would you guys stay out of there?

455
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,014
Patches, no, that computer
is not a chew toy.

456
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,520
Hey, get your tail
out of that pencil sharpener.

457
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,023
Cookie, stop barking at your brother!

458
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,184
Where's the Dog Whisperer
when you need him?

459
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,057
At least they're not wearing sweaters.

460
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,200
The wife is at the groomers today,
so I'm watching the litter.

461
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,670
Uh-oh.
Patches, take your brothers outside.

462
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,602
Let's go!

463
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,169
And don't take treats from strangers!

464
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,645
Kids.

465
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,906
Tab Lazenby.

466
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,778
So you're the new fat cat at MEOWS.

467
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:30,853
And when I say "fat cat," I mean you
might wanna switch to the skim milk.

468
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:35,015
<i>Oh, Lou, so catty. I see they've given you
the key to the executive Dumpster.</i>

469
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,360
<i>All that butt-sniffing paid off.</i>

470
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,598
<i>But enough pleasantries.
You have one of my operatives.</i>

471
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,199
I understand that Kitty Galore
is one of yours too.

472
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,893
<i>She's our spilled milk. We'll lick it up.</i>

473
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,368
<i>You can't begin to imagine
how dangerous she is.</i>

474
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,303
<i>She'll never stop
until she has her revenge.</i>

475
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,909
She's threatening us, Tab.

476
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,102
It takes a dog to chase a cat.

477
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,544
<i>But it'll take a cat to catch this kitty.</i>

478
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,583
This isn't about who should go after Kitty.
It's about protecting the humans.

479
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,120
She's right. We can't just sit around
arguing jurisdiction.

480
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,054
Unless...

481
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,717
Now, this would be a first
in our political history.

482
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:15,923
<i>With 24 hours left on Kitty's deadline,
we may have no other choice.</i>

483
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,329
- Cats and dogs will have to work together.
- Cats and dogs will have to work together.

484
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,907
That ain't right.

485
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,601
What? No way, man. Work with her?

486
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,577
Why don't we go ahead
and make an alliance with the mailman?

487
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,340
Diggs! Wait outside with Seamus.

488
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,951
Work with cats? I'd rather have worms.

489
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,053
- Outside! Now!
- Ugh.

490
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,052
Where I'm from, we don't play with cats.

491
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,850
- We chase them.
- Bye-bye, now.

492
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:45,257
Lou, the kid's got a point. We can't just
work with cats. We can't trust them.

493
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,523
You're being dramatic.

494
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,930
What do these guys want from me?
I can't work with a cat.

495
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,127
But I don't wanna go back to the kennel.

496
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,364
You ever live in a cage, my friend?

497
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,974
Ha. I wish.

498
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:02,476
The little swings, free sunflower seeds,
that little mirror to hang with.

499
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,610
Man, I wish I was back
with my partner, Shane.

500
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,478
Now, that was a sweet setup.

501
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,247
You know who has
the sweetest setup? Cats. Mm-mm-mm.

502
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,516
Talk about cushy.
They're pampered like royalty.

503
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,889
This one house my cousin Nicky
used to work at for Kitty Galore...

504
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,031
...it was a feline paradise.

505
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,723
House? What house?

506
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,566
Butch! I think I know
where we can find Kitty!

507
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,168
This is historic.

508
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,574
Three species coming together, putting
aside our differences to solve a mystery.

509
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,307
This is like the Dream Team,
except we ain't dreaming.

510
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,644
Pick up your paws, y'all.
We're almost there.

511
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,080
What are you talking about?

512
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,154
Is there a soundproof bag
we can stuff him in?

513
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,387
This is the joint where Nicky
smuggled stuff for Kitty Galore. I think.

514
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,152
No, it is, I'm positive.

515
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,694
Sixty-five percent sure.

516
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,059
I could go up to 67, but I'm de...

517
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,326
Oh, look, a potato bug!

518
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,164
Stay alert. Kitty could be ready
to pounce inside.

519
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,898
We're on an epic quest.
Through foreign lands.

520
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,532
Learning about each other.
And a little about ourselves.

521
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,240
Collar: Lockpick.

522
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:26,987
Look out!

523
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,459
Whoa, man!

524
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,796
Hey. It's, like, a bunch of dogs, man.

525
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,373
Awesome.

526
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,467
Hey, are we related?

527
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,375
Dude, I saw it blink.

528
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,978
What's up with these guys?

529
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,980
Hopped up on catnip.

530
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,018
Cat ladies, such enablers.

531
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,385
Okay, stay on your toes, team.
Let's move.

532
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,987
Oh, boy.

533
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,799
Does schnookems want attention?

534
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,097
Oh, lovely.

535
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,138
Beautiful pussycat. Beautiful puss.

536
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:12,700
Oh, dear.

537
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,407
- Hey, try and keep up, schnookems.
Go play in traffic.

538
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,345
Shake a tail feather, I'm on the clock.

539
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,506
Here's what we got:

540
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,052
One fresh microchip, and, oh,
a thingamajig with a button on it.

541
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,980
All right. It looks like
one of Kitty's henchcats.

542
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,218
The key word here is "stealth."
No one makes a move till I say so.

543
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,592
Excuse me. I'm a cat. I think I know
a thing or two about stealth.

544
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,096
I wasn't talking to you.

545
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,031
- I was talking to the rookie.
- Less talk, more rock!

546
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,967
Everybody down on the flo...!
Whoa-ooh!

547
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,266
Beat it, it's the cops!

548
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,171
I have underwear on my head, don't I?

549
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,675
I said stealth!
You just lost us one of our leads.

550
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,111
Oh, hey! How's it going?

551
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,046
- I want answers.
- No, I want answers.

552
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,515
No, I want answers.

553
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,880
No, I want answers.

554
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:01,047
I'll give both of you guys answers.
I'm an encyclopedia of answers.

555
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,692
All right. Where's Kitty Galore?

556
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,622
She's... l... Who?

557
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,627
- Let me at him!
- Ah!

558
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,269
Is it supposed to do that?

559
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,939
What the...?

560
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,275
I'm going to guess, no,
it's not supposed to do that!

561
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,036
This is not good.

562
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,904
Ha-ha! You fools!

563
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:28,916
In five minutes this room will fill up,
and you're all gonna drown in kitty litter!

564
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,449
Bet you weren't expecting that, suckers!

565
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,587
But you're inside too.

566
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,625
No! I'm long gone!

567
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,763
Outside, safe and sound...

568
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:45,233
...while you losers are in here,
trapped in a rising tide of...

569
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,933
I mean, l...

570
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,302
Get me out of here!
I'll tell you anything! Anything!

571
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:58,346
And with that, I am officially no longer
the dumbest animal in the room.

572
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,883
The window! We can get out the window!

573
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,647
If we all work together, we can reach it.
We'll form a dog-cat pyramid.

574
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,091
You step on my back,
Catherine will step on yours.

575
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,625
She'll scratch me.
How about I get on her back?

576
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,389
Why don't you just try it
and see what happens?

577
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,191
I'll do it!

578
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,433
Goodness. Someone made a schtinky.

579
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,868
Why can't you go in the yard
like a normal animal?

580
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,067
Like a dog, rushing in without thinking.

581
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,974
You two wanna live or keep fighting?

582
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,239
Does schnookems
need to be let outside?

583
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,486
Whoa. Did you see that?

584
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,062
Yeah, I know!

585
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,495
Wait, what are we talking about?

586
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,603
You guys aren't mad, are you?
Where's Kitty?

587
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,263
Start talking, or these dogs are gonna
rip into you like a bag of Snausages.

588
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,633
Okay, okay!

589
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,177
Look, I don't know where Kitty is,
but I can tell you this.

590
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:06,981
For months now,
Kitty has been stealing technology...

591
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,778
<i>... from, like, NASA...</i>

592
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,515
<i>... the Pentagon...</i>

593
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,055
<i>You should've seen what we got
from Bill Gates' cat, Mr. Windows.</i>

594
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,216
<i>Now, I'm just the middlecat.</i>

595
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,557
<i>I take the parts,
give them to pigeon couriers...</i>

596
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,528
...and they fly them to a secret location.

597
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,894
Which is where?

598
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,099
How would I know? It's a secret.

599
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,605
- Sounds like she's building something.
- But what?

600
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,935
Who can understand the mind
of a crazy old cat?

601
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,509
- I know!
- Wait, what?

602
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,044
You know what she's building?

603
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,182
No. I know a crazy old cat.
Ha-ha-ha!

604
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,456
Okay, guys.

605
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,186
This cat is nuts,
but he might lead us to Kitty.

606
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,092
Unless you want a bone buried
where the sun don't shine...

607
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,789
...let me do all the talking.

608
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,400
Yes, sir, captain. Captain. Mr. Man.

609
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,298
Keep pushing me, Diggs.

610
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,770
Now, watch your step.
And stay close. Things could get hairy.

611
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:07,968
If I grow any hair, I am leaving.
I can't do hair and feathers.

612
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:19,950
It's just miserable but I like the...
What? What?

613
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:21,447
Wait up! Don't leave me!

614
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:26,085
Hey, birdy-birdy. Mm.

615
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:28,954
Check out my ink.

616
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,732
Oh, how cute, he hearts his mommy.

617
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:35,163
Oh, what a cute...

618
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:39,800
Can we leave now?

619
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:41,943
You look tasty.

620
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:46,980
Tasty? Why, thank you. I try to keep fit.

621
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,885
Mr. Tinkles.

622
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:59,218
We need the insight of your
twisted mind to locate Kitty Galore.

623
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:03,091
- Lf you were to build a doomsday device...
- You'll never find love, you know.

624
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:07,361
I can tell by the way you're sitting.
So apart from the others.

625
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,436
They wouldn't invite
any ordinary cat, would they?

626
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:12,072
No.

627
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:15,107
You're an agent. With MEOWS.

628
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,905
Spying on your own
brothers and sisters?

629
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,671
Naughty little girl.

630
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:22,408
But that takes a very special
kind of feline.

631
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:26,452
Someone dedicated,
driven and very angry.

632
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:28,748
But at who? Daddy?

633
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:30,788
Who's your daddy, Catherine?

634
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:32,116
That's enough!

635
00:40:32,294 --> 00:40:35,388
Butch! You look old. And fat.

636
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:39,727
And after all these years,
still only a field agent?

637
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:43,098
Listen here, you freaky cat.
We're here to talk about Kitty Galore.

638
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:44,568
Who the heck are you?

639
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,037
That bulge under your left ear...

640
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:50,234
You were implanted with
a RFID microchip.

641
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:52,880
I'm guessing police work.

642
00:40:53,048 --> 00:40:57,109
My, my, so young to be
dismissed from the force.

643
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,487
Tell me, officer, do you hate me?

644
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,385
Do you wanna chew me up
and spit me out...

645
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:08,052
...as has been done to you
in relationship after relationship?

646
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,256
Ooh! Ooh! Do me next! Do me!

647
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:14,393
What color am I thinking of?

648
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:17,135
The last bird who stood
this close to me...

649
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:20,706
...well, I enjoyed his company
with a plate of Fancy Feast...

650
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,867
...and a nice saucer of milk.
Th-th-th-th.

651
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:27,338
Hairball.

652
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,907
I was thinking of blue, Creepy McGee.

653
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:34,021
Originally I was thinking yellow,
but yellow's so obvious.

654
00:41:34,189 --> 00:41:35,747
Dogs.

655
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:48,200
Hey, Kitty, I got news.

656
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,036
What is the world coming to?

657
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:54,937
Cats and dogs can't work together!

658
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,908
What to do? What to do?

659
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,038
Aha. Paws! Time to call in...

660
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:04,208
...the MacDougall twins.

661
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:08,822
I always wondered what Garfield
would look like in a dress.

662
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,185
Betrayed by my own kind.

663
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,793
I guess it's just you and me,
Scrumptious.

664
00:42:13,962 --> 00:42:15,725
Wait. Where's Scrumptious?

665
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:17,888
Scrumptious? Scrumptious?

666
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,896
Scrumptious?

667
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:22,459
I'm here! In here!

668
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:26,636
You animal!
Spit him out! Spit him out!

669
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:30,039
If anyone eats that mouse,
it's gonna be me!

670
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,004
Kitty!

671
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,215
Okay, Scrumptious, not a squeak.

672
00:42:37,385 --> 00:42:38,716
Close your eyes!

673
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,479
I have got a surprise for you!

674
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:47,384
Kitty, now, watch carefully.

675
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:52,898
For our big opening,
you are gonna go in here, like this.

676
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:58,934
Now, let's see. Sword A into slot B.

677
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,937
The crowd "oohs" and "ahhs"...

678
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:04,202
...as I put sword D into slot...

679
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:05,437
...seven?

680
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:08,810
And then I say the magic words,
"Abracadabra..."

681
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:10,541
And then:

682
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:11,776
Ta-da!

683
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:15,552
Ooh, ooh! Ooh.

684
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:17,486
That was wrong.

685
00:43:21,095 --> 00:43:23,791
Enough pussy-footing around,
Tinkles! Where's Kitty Galore?

686
00:43:23,965 --> 00:43:25,694
All right, everybody, chill.

687
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:30,065
There is one way
to defeat Kitty Galore.

688
00:43:30,238 --> 00:43:33,230
- Step one: Release me immediately.
- What? Forget it.

689
00:43:33,408 --> 00:43:35,399
- Step two: I need a space shuttle.
- No.

690
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:38,077
Oh, all right. You guys are no fun.

691
00:43:38,246 --> 00:43:42,478
Look, I can't help you fight other villains,
all right? It's a professional courtesy thing.

692
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:45,812
I'd be blackballed, laughed at.
I'd lose my pension.

693
00:43:45,987 --> 00:43:48,080
However, I will say this.

694
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:52,420
A cat's eye reveals everything.

695
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:55,153
What? What's that supposed to mean?

696
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,797
It's a riddle, Sherlock.

697
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,329
I was trying to be mysterious.
Oh, never mind.

698
00:44:00,502 --> 00:44:02,732
And now, leave!

699
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:04,428
I'm planning my escape, you know.

700
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:06,262
Yeah? Good luck with that.

701
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,672
What? Good luck?
For the great Tinkles?

702
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:13,075
An evil genius doesn't need good luck.

703
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:15,876
Although, I could use a passport
and a speedboat.

704
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:17,707
Cats rule.

705
00:44:28,296 --> 00:44:31,629
There. That ought to do it.

706
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:33,964
What was Tinkles talking about?

707
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:37,798
"A cat's eye reveals everything."
That don't even make no sense.

708
00:44:37,972 --> 00:44:41,567
Tinkles doesn't know where Kitty Galore is.
He's manipulative, he's psychotic.

709
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,438
In other words, your typical feline.

710
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:47,479
Psychotic is chasing a ball when
it's just gonna be thrown again.

711
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:48,980
What a pointless activity.

712
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:52,449
The game of fetch is one of the most
exciting outdoor sports...

713
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,249
...this side of squirrel chasing.
- Would you two please muzzle it?

714
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:19,343
Now, where is that stupid bird
Kitty wants us to knock off? Ha!

715
00:45:20,214 --> 00:45:21,772
There you are.

716
00:45:23,384 --> 00:45:26,512
What? What's happening, Angus?
Let me see.

717
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:28,246
Duncan, would you be quiet!

718
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:31,051
After the mission, can we get ice cream?

719
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:34,558
Yes, yes, yes, we can get ice cream.
Now be quiet!

720
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:37,095
I love ice cream.

721
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:38,857
<i>Attention, humans!</i>

722
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:42,298
<i>This is your captain, Angus MacNot-a-cat!</i>

723
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,166
<i>There's a whale up front
and he's taking song requests!</i>

724
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:48,206
<i>And he's made of candy.</i>

725
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:50,105
<i>Go now! Go.</i>

726
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:51,336
Something's up.

727
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:55,405
Oh, hello, little red dot.

728
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,643
Hey. Hold up. What the...?

729
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,185
Seamus, what are you doing?

730
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:01,617
Catherine?

731
00:46:02,023 --> 00:46:03,923
Look out! The MacDougall twins!

732
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:05,252
The MacWhats?

733
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:08,727
- Catherine, look out!
- No!

734
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:16,265
- Diggs, what'd you do that for?
I'm not sure.

735
00:46:17,105 --> 00:46:18,970
Catherine, protect that pigeon.

736
00:46:21,643 --> 00:46:23,110
I'll get the cat!

737
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:36,983
Wait! I love Scotland.
And the Scotch tape.

738
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:38,625
<i>- Where'd you go?
- And Braveheart.</i>

739
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:53,505
Collar: Laser!

740
00:46:58,279 --> 00:46:59,473
Have fun!

741
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,008
What...?

742
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:07,281
Batter up!

743
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:12,658
Look! There's the whale.

744
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:18,024
Butch, if you're not too busy.
Need a little help!

745
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,257
Diggs, hold still.

746
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:21,595
I'll use my laser.
Now, don't move a paw!

747
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,670
Yippee ki yay, little puppy!

748
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,774
Hey, Catherine!
We got a doggy overboard!

749
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:30,410
- Do something, I'm slipping!
Diggs!

750
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:34,312
No! I can't. It's the water. I never...

751
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:37,178
We'll call Dr. Phil later.
But right now I need some help.

752
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:44,618
Take that! And you're lucky I don't
smack you upside your cat head.

753
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:47,188
Kick him in the bagpipes, Butch!

754
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:50,262
I've got you in my sights, you wee bird!

755
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:51,659
What are you doing?

756
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:54,961
Now it's my turn.

757
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:58,466
Now, don't be hasty, dog.
I was just having a wee bit of fun.

758
00:47:58,639 --> 00:47:59,628
Fun?

759
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:04,840
Mom, Mom! It's happening again.

760
00:48:06,347 --> 00:48:07,678
What?

761
00:48:08,483 --> 00:48:10,314
Honey, there's nothing there.

762
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:13,079
- Hey! Just a friendly reminder.
- Seamus!

763
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:15,381
Your mission is still to protect...

764
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:16,580
...me!

765
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:18,055
Catherine, snap out of it.

766
00:48:18,226 --> 00:48:21,559
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I've never seen so much of it.

767
00:48:21,729 --> 00:48:24,527
Oh, God, I can't even look at it.
I wanna help you, but...

768
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,860
- Here goes nothing!
- Diggs, no!

769
00:48:28,836 --> 00:48:30,030
No guts, no glory.

770
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:31,771
No brakes!

771
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:36,505
Gotcha.

772
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:40,773
Take that! How's your fancy suit
working out for you now, fur face?

773
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:43,775
Wait.

774
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:45,213
Where's Kitty Galore?

775
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:47,183
Preparing the Call of the Wild.

776
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:52,691
Soon your feeble canine brains will feel
her wrath, and dogkind will crumble!

777
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:54,521
Smack him around!

778
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:56,595
Your pecking days are over, bird.

779
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:59,255
Kitty knows your pal Nicky
gave you the blueprints.

780
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,564
Blueprints? What blueprints?

781
00:49:01,736 --> 00:49:02,794
Let go, let go.

782
00:49:03,004 --> 00:49:05,370
Stand down, Diggs.
I'll question him from here.

783
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:08,433
- Negative.
- That's enough! I said stand down!

784
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:10,338
I got him, pops. I know what I'm...

785
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:20,310
Hey, Angus. Now can we get ice cream?

786
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:30,393
Diggs! You've ruined everything.

787
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:34,558
First you let the carrier pigeon get away.
Then you almost drowned us in kitty litter.

788
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,999
And now you've let
the MacDougalls escape!

789
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:40,334
Well, I didn't blow up the ferry.
I mean, that's something.

790
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:42,805
I've had it with you. You're untrainable.

791
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:46,310
I told Lou you didn't have what it takes
to be an agent, and I was right.

792
00:49:47,415 --> 00:49:51,249
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying go home, Diggs.

793
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:54,084
You're off this team.

794
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,183
I don't wanna be rude,
but the bird's still all good, right?

795
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:03,124
Come on, Seamus. We've got work to do.

796
00:50:03,297 --> 00:50:04,355
What about you?

797
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:07,996
I'll catch up with you.
I need to check in with MEOWS first.

798
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:09,593
Suit yourself.

799
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:12,567
Good luck, dog.

800
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:17,166
You don't have to pretend
to check in with MEOWS...

801
00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:19,677
...just so you can thank me
for saving your life.

802
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:21,974
Uh, I do have to check in with MEOWS.

803
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:24,411
Oh, right.

804
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:28,954
But I, um, also want to thank you
for saving my life.

805
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,651
- Hey, you're hurt.
- No, I'm fine.

806
00:50:32,193 --> 00:50:35,185
Well, too bad, tough guy.
You're coming with me to get fixed up.

807
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:45,765
- Sir, you haven't seen this dog, have you?
- Sorry.

808
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,707
<i>- Hello?
Hi, sweetheart, it's me.</i>

809
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:53,244
<i>- Hey, honey.
- How's it going? Did you find him?</i>

810
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:55,746
No, nothing yet.
I can't believe I let this happen.

811
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:58,647
<i>It wasn't your fault.
You're doing everything you can.</i>

812
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:02,050
Yeah, I know. I just feel like
I'm so close to finding him.

813
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:04,555
<i>Come home and we'll look together.</i>

814
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,594
Where is he? Where is he?
Hey!

815
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:10,458
- Hey!
I'm running out of time.

816
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:14,067
- Where is that stupid pigeon?
- I don't know.

817
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,635
Hey, there's my cat.
What do you say there, Kitty?

818
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:19,534
And where have you been?

819
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:22,676
Hey, calm down.
Can't a guy take a statue break?

820
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:26,408
Excellent. This computer chip
is the last piece I need.

821
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:28,638
Now no one can stand in my way.

822
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:33,610
What was that?
- That, my dear?

823
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:38,225
That's just a loose end
that's conveniently tied itself up.

824
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:39,859
Kitty!

825
00:51:49,337 --> 00:51:52,329
My humans are out tonight,
so relax while I check in with MEOWS.

826
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:58,573
Come on, Diggs.
Just one paw after the other.

827
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,309
- Lf my nieces give you any trouble...
- Nieces?

828
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:08,744
Look, guys. Auntie Catherine brought
home a friend. And he's a doggy!

829
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:11,153
Okay. Um...

830
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:12,917
Hi. Hello.

831
00:52:13,094 --> 00:52:16,586
Catherine, could you help me out here?
This is too adorable for my taste.

832
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,534
Is it true there's a spot on your tummy,
and if I tickle it, your foot will shake?

833
00:52:23,704 --> 00:52:24,762
No, that's just a myth.

834
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:25,997
Ah! Whoo!

835
00:52:26,173 --> 00:52:27,765
You found it! Oh, boy!

836
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:29,102
Oh, boy, that's it.

837
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,141
- All right, girls. That's enough.
Man.

838
00:52:31,312 --> 00:52:33,872
- Aw.
Leave the poor mutt alone.

839
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:36,778
No fair.
Bye-bye, puppy.

840
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,181
Now, let's have a look at that paw.

841
00:52:39,353 --> 00:52:41,378
Oh, it's just a little splinter.

842
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:44,547
Really? It feels like a giant
six-inch spike. Like a... Ouch!

843
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:47,717
Oh, come on.
My nieces are tougher than that.

844
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:50,063
Yeah, they're unbelievable.

845
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:53,564
I mean, I'm a dog.
I can't believe they don't hate me.

846
00:52:54,235 --> 00:52:56,328
Well, I guess they haven't learned to yet.

847
00:52:56,871 --> 00:53:00,864
Anyway, listen, thanks for fixing me up.
I should be heading home now.

848
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:03,408
Home, huh? So where do you live?

849
00:53:03,577 --> 00:53:06,341
Oh, uh, well, it was over at the...

850
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:10,781
You know, I'm kind of between homes
right now, so I'll probably just...

851
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:12,612
I'll just head back to the kennel.

852
00:53:12,787 --> 00:53:14,652
The kennel? That's terrible.

853
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:17,085
No, it's fine. Really, it's fine.

854
00:53:17,258 --> 00:53:20,659
Diggs, how much time
have you spent in kennels?

855
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:23,489
I guess I was just a pup
when I first got dropped off.

856
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:25,894
My owner said he'd be right back, but...

857
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:28,433
Well, how did you finally get out?

858
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:30,797
My man, Shane. He's a cop.

859
00:53:30,971 --> 00:53:33,235
I guess he saw something in me
nobody else did.

860
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:34,669
Made me his partner.

861
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:37,002
And I swore I was never
gonna let him down.

862
00:53:37,178 --> 00:53:40,807
There was no way I was ever gonna
wind up in the kennel again.

863
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:42,243
And then what?

864
00:53:43,184 --> 00:53:45,118
I wound up in the kennel again.

865
00:53:45,286 --> 00:53:48,449
No matter how hard I try,
I just keep messing things up.

866
00:53:48,622 --> 00:53:50,249
Or blowing things up.

867
00:53:50,424 --> 00:53:53,154
Uh, could all of this have
something to do with...

868
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:56,125
...not being able to follow an order
to save your life?

869
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:58,663
But it's not like I don't
wanna follow orders.

870
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,267
It's just, I learned pretty early on...

871
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:05,701
...that the only one I could count on,
the only one I could really trust, was me.

872
00:54:05,906 --> 00:54:08,136
That way,
no one could ever let me down.

873
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:10,543
Yeah, but no one can help you either.

874
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:14,212
Right.

875
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:18,117
Hey, funky doorbell.

876
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:20,651
No, it's MEOWS. Come on, let's go.

877
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:23,312
A room full of cats? Try and stop me!

878
00:54:23,824 --> 00:54:27,521
Oh, man, here we go again.
I was born in a box bigger than this.

879
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:30,357
Ouch! Will you get off my tail? Hang on.

880
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:34,297
Oh, right, the dropping-floor thing,
I've seen one... Oh!

881
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:44,977
Uh... Little help here?

882
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,577
Welcome to MEOWS.

883
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:52,178
Whoa.

884
00:54:52,353 --> 00:54:55,254
This is not an emergency, sir.
You still have seven lives left.

885
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:57,856
Okay, Diggs, no barking, no drooling...

886
00:54:58,025 --> 00:55:01,586
...and definitely no chasing
my colleagues.

887
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:09,493
Tab, Agent 47 reporting for duty.

888
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:13,570
<i>Alert! Alert!
The perimeter has been breached.</i>

889
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:18,436
Guys, please, can you stop running?
I'm fighting the urge to chase you.

890
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:20,512
No, no, Tab, he's cool. He's with me.

891
00:55:20,848 --> 00:55:23,976
Oh, Catherine. I feel like an idiot up here.

892
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:31,681
Stand down, brigadier. The dog lives.

893
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:35,693
Oh, man! I never get to use this thing!

894
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:38,755
We're outsourcing?

895
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:42,596
Does he look rabid to you?
He looks rabid to me.

896
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:45,637
We've isolated a voice on Kitty Galore's
threat recording.

897
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:48,036
<i>I will enslave all mankind!</i>

898
00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:50,541
<i>Kitty! I'm home!</i>

899
00:55:50,711 --> 00:55:52,110
A human. Definitely human.

900
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:54,770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.
- Right.

901
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:57,140
Now zoom in.

902
00:55:59,453 --> 00:56:02,081
Well, I'll be. Tinkles was right.

903
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:04,588
A cat's eye does reveal everything.

904
00:56:04,758 --> 00:56:06,817
Tab, flip the image.

905
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:09,256
"Chuck the Magnificent."

906
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:12,122
Okay, let's see.

907
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,727
Aha. Here we are.

908
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:19,165
Playland, huh?

909
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,900
So who's up for a corn dog?

910
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:25,739
Can I ask you something?

911
00:56:25,913 --> 00:56:29,314
Don't take this wrong. You know
that saying, "Cat got your tongue"?

912
00:56:29,483 --> 00:56:30,814
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

913
00:56:30,985 --> 00:56:33,180
You're not gonna
steal my tongue, are you?

914
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:35,083
It's an expression, Diggs.

915
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:37,053
Whoa, whoa! Man, you drive like a girl.

916
00:56:37,224 --> 00:56:39,089
No, Diggs, I drive like a cat.

917
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,728
Now, be a good dog
and stick your head out the window.

918
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:47,792
Brake, brake, brake.
- Welcome to Playland. Parking is $5.

919
00:56:53,974 --> 00:56:55,134
Enjoy the park, sir.

920
00:57:02,616 --> 00:57:04,447
This place looks pretty secure.

921
00:57:04,618 --> 00:57:07,018
So how exactly are we planning
on getting in there?

922
00:57:18,232 --> 00:57:20,097
Wait a second.

923
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:22,469
I know what to do.

924
00:57:22,636 --> 00:57:24,126
Butch taught me this.

925
00:57:24,305 --> 00:57:28,207
This is a little maneuver
I like to call "Fetch a Stick."

926
00:57:39,687 --> 00:57:40,711
Whoops.

927
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:45,249
We haven't got much time.

928
00:57:45,426 --> 00:57:47,986
Look for something that resembles
a bologna with a head.

929
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:58,697
Okay there. Yikes.

930
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:01,704
Catherine, I sure hope
we're not chasing our tails here.

931
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,836
What the...?

932
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:07,276
Is this what it's come to, darlings?

933
00:58:07,448 --> 00:58:10,349
Cats and dogs working together?

934
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:14,715
Call me old-fashioned, but I preferred it
when we all hated each other.

935
00:58:14,888 --> 00:58:17,789
Don't worry. We still hate you.

936
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:20,620
Not even a mother
could love that face.

937
00:58:21,261 --> 00:58:22,592
MEOWS! This is Agent 4...

938
00:58:22,763 --> 00:58:25,027
- Hey! What are you doing?
Catherine!

939
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,463
No! My collar!

940
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:30,895
<i>In the still</i>

941
00:58:31,071 --> 00:58:34,837
<i>- Of the night
- Shoo-doop, doobie-doop</i>

942
00:58:35,008 --> 00:58:36,805
<i>I held you</i>

943
00:58:36,977 --> 00:58:39,639
I don't know.
Maybe I was too hard on the kid.

944
00:58:39,813 --> 00:58:43,544
Let's see, some thread,
some twigs, a rubber band...

945
00:58:43,717 --> 00:58:45,651
Scratch that, two rubber bands!

946
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:48,117
What a lucky...
You talking about lucky...

947
00:58:48,288 --> 00:58:51,052
- Wait, what are we are looking for?
- The blueprints.

948
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:54,217
The cat on the ferry said your cousin Nicky
gave you blueprints.

949
00:58:54,395 --> 00:58:55,453
Oh, yeah.

950
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:57,790
- Let me look.
- This is my house!

951
00:58:58,399 --> 00:59:01,766
You'll ruin this place.
My insurance doesn't cover this.

952
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:05,029
This is why my landlord said no pets.

953
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:13,442
Well, always great having you over, Butch.
You're the life of the party.

954
00:59:13,614 --> 00:59:16,344
Hey, what's Kitty Galore's name
doing on my wallpaper?

955
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:20,417
That's not wallpaper.
That's a blueprint for a giant satellite dish.

956
00:59:20,587 --> 00:59:21,986
This is worse than we thought!

957
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:25,387
She's trying to get free HBO.

958
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:27,656
This is why Kitty's after you.

959
00:59:27,828 --> 00:59:30,126
Your Cousin Nicky stashed this here.

960
00:59:30,297 --> 00:59:31,423
Collar: Camera.

961
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:39,169
HQ, you getting this?

962
00:59:39,339 --> 00:59:42,035
Holy lawn log.
That thing is three stories tall.

963
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:45,473
If this device is real,
it's our worst fears come true.

964
00:59:45,646 --> 00:59:49,514
Lou, MEOWS here. We just picked up
a distress signal from Catherine.

965
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:52,277
- She's with one of your agents.
- Diggs!

966
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:55,684
They were chasing a lead on Kitty's
hideout, a place called Playland.

967
00:59:55,856 --> 00:59:58,723
You're looking for one
Chuck the Magnificent.

968
00:59:58,892 --> 01:00:02,055
Tab, I'm sending you a blueprint.
Butch, go get our agent.

969
01:00:02,262 --> 01:00:05,026
Copy that! I just hope the kid's okay.

970
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:07,532
So this is how it ends for me.

971
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:11,398
In a circus tent, chained to a cat.
Great master plan, Kitty.

972
01:00:11,572 --> 01:00:15,838
Bup-bup-bup. Don't judge my master plan
until you've heard the whole thing, huh?

973
01:00:16,176 --> 01:00:19,373
You see, in 20 minutes,
I will begin broadcasting...

974
01:00:19,546 --> 01:00:22,413
...the Call of the Wild!

975
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:27,714
And every canine on this planet
will become a mad dog, forever!

976
01:00:27,888 --> 01:00:30,618
Like I'm supposed to believe
a bunch of weird sounds...

977
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:33,225
...are gonna make me
a "mad dog, forever."

978
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:37,090
Ah. So you do understand.

979
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:40,698
I was worried the whole thing
was a tad complicated.

980
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:43,428
You know, for a dog.

981
01:00:44,171 --> 01:00:49,438
Paws! Let's show our friends what
we have up our metaphorical sleeve.

982
01:00:49,943 --> 01:00:54,107
A dog's sensitive hearing has always been
considered a tactical advantage.

983
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:57,909
But now, it will be their downfall.

984
01:00:58,085 --> 01:00:59,575
Observe.

985
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,220
Look at the little doggy losing control.

986
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:08,088
They're even turning on their owners.
Humans have no idea what's happened.

987
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:10,025
Their dogs have all gone mad!

988
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:14,099
And there's only one place
for a mad dog.

989
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:16,736
No, no. Not the kennels.

990
01:01:16,904 --> 01:01:18,963
Yes, yes, the kennels!

991
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:21,539
Where they will be forever alone...

992
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,472
...unwanted, unloved.

993
01:01:24,645 --> 01:01:28,240
Seem familiar, Officer Diggs?

994
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:31,979
Nice try, Kitty.
But there's a lot of dogs in this world.

995
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:34,916
What are you gonna do,
go door-to-door with your sound?

996
01:01:35,088 --> 01:01:37,386
That would take you the rest
of your nine lives.

997
01:01:37,558 --> 01:01:40,959
That's true. Unless I had a satellite.

998
01:01:41,895 --> 01:01:43,954
Why do you think I've been
telling you this?

999
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:47,259
I got time to kill until
my satellite's in position.

1000
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:49,493
Then, once I beam the signal...

1001
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:54,573
...it will instantly broadcast from every TV,
radio and cell phone on earth!

1002
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:56,174
Okay, show's over.

1003
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:58,776
No, no! You'll never get away
with this, Kitty!

1004
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:01,506
I was hoping someone would say
I'll never get away with this.

1005
01:02:01,682 --> 01:02:05,243
It'll make it so much
more satisfying when I do!

1006
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:07,182
Now, sit back and relax.

1007
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:09,978
Perhaps you'd care for a drink of water?

1008
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:15,625
No! Water. Not water.

1009
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:17,286
Anything but water.

1010
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:19,928
Please, Kitty. I can't swim.

1011
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,660
Perfect. I don't want you to swim.

1012
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:25,202
I want you to drown!

1013
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:34,009
We're almost at Playland.

1014
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:37,548
Oh, if there's one ride we should go on,
it's the roller coaster.

1015
01:02:37,718 --> 01:02:39,276
We're not going on any rides.

1016
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:42,980
Don't be scared.
I'll hold your paw, big baby.

1017
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:50,521
- There's gotta be a way out of here.
- Catherine, listen.

1018
01:02:50,697 --> 01:02:55,066
Since this is the end, I guess
I can say I think I might like you.

1019
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:57,633
- Diggs, stop.
- No. Shh. Don't say anything.

1020
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:00,364
I know it's uncomfortable,
but I think we're buds.

1021
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:03,407
There, I said it. I like a cat.

1022
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:04,976
I feel so free!

1023
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:06,908
No, stop! I can use your collar!

1024
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,981
No, it doesn't do anything.
It's not even good for fleas.

1025
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:12,243
No, if I could just get it loose...

1026
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,647
...I can pick the lock.

1027
01:03:18,058 --> 01:03:19,685
Nice work! Okay, now me.

1028
01:03:20,827 --> 01:03:22,158
No!

1029
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:27,025
Don't worry, Diggs.
I'll get you out of here.

1030
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,691
No, Catherine. There's no time.
You gotta stop Kitty.

1031
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,861
I'm not leaving you, Diggs.

1032
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:34,405
Come on, Catherine. You can do this.

1033
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,218
Oh, you owe me bigtime, dog.

1034
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:53,223
Yeah, about what I said before,
about liking cats...

1035
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:55,384
- Never happened.
- Thank you.

1036
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:07,637
Hey, Kitty!
Sorry, practice went a little long.

1037
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:10,367
Where are you, girl?

1038
01:04:12,646 --> 01:04:15,877
Chuck, you're a grade-A doofus.
Here they are.

1039
01:04:16,316 --> 01:04:17,442
Kitty?

1040
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:19,376
You in here?

1041
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:25,622
Don't worry, Kitty.
We all get stage fright sometimes.

1042
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:27,555
We can get through this together.

1043
01:04:27,728 --> 01:04:29,889
The show must go on!

1044
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:32,861
Just need five minutes.

1045
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:35,992
Maybe 10.

1046
01:04:36,169 --> 01:04:39,161
Caramel corn. You have any idea
what the street value of that is?

1047
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:40,931
- Is that Seamus?
Over here!

1048
01:04:41,108 --> 01:04:44,168
There's no reason we can't save
the world and get snow cones.

1049
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:45,777
- Hey, guys.
- Catherine!

1050
01:04:45,946 --> 01:04:47,106
- Rookie!
Butch.

1051
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:48,671
Collar: Comlink.

1052
01:04:49,182 --> 01:04:51,241
HQ, we have Catherine and Diggs.

1053
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:53,909
<i>Nice work, Butch.
Now find Kitty's device.</i>

1054
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:58,785
Where could Kitty be hiding
that satellite dish?

1055
01:04:58,959 --> 01:05:02,520
It must be huge. You can't just hide
something like that.

1056
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:06,792
Hey, wait a second.
That ride looks kind of like a...

1057
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:09,835
It sure does.
Genius!

1058
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:14,369
What? All I see is
a giant satellite-dish-Iooking...

1059
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:16,475
Oh.

1060
01:05:16,777 --> 01:05:18,904
Team, huddle up.

1061
01:05:19,646 --> 01:05:22,376
It's go time.
Save the dogs, save the world.

1062
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:25,107
First thing to do, get on top of that ride.

1063
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:29,779
Yes! Wait. Is there
a height requirement for this ride?

1064
01:05:35,428 --> 01:05:39,956
Behold my glorious device!

1065
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,294
Careful, Scrumptious.

1066
01:05:45,472 --> 01:05:48,771
Scratch that disc, I scratch you.

1067
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,720
In mere moments,
the planet becomes my scratching post!

1068
01:06:05,892 --> 01:06:08,258
Excuse me,
has anyone seen my assistant?

1069
01:06:08,728 --> 01:06:11,424
She kind of looks like a raw chicken.

1070
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,597
Oh, my Lord! Kitty!

1071
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:17,737
Get down from there!

1072
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:20,595
Let's get this party started.

1073
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:26,236
As soon as my satellite is in position,
I hit the button and upload the signal!

1074
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:28,840
Uh-oh.
- What?

1075
01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:32,785
Three, two, one...

1076
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:34,750
What in the world?

1077
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:40,283
I love being a spy dog! Yeah!

1078
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:45,590
Why am I doing this?

1079
01:06:45,765 --> 01:06:47,027
Brakes, brakes, brakes.

1080
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,031
Hey, Catzilla!

1081
01:06:54,107 --> 01:06:55,540
Yes! Perfect landing.

1082
01:06:55,742 --> 01:06:59,473
Watch out, Kitty, because Seamus
is about to kick your... Ah! Ooh!

1083
01:07:00,113 --> 01:07:02,308
Paws! Stop them!

1084
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,578
Kitty! Where...?

1085
01:07:09,556 --> 01:07:11,148
Ah! It's so tangly!

1086
01:07:14,294 --> 01:07:15,818
Is that the magician?

1087
01:07:15,996 --> 01:07:18,658
Ooh. This guy is amazing.

1088
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:27,295
The satellite is almost in position.
Okay, we've analyzed the blueprints...

1089
01:07:27,474 --> 01:07:29,908
...and we think there's a kill switch
on that device.

1090
01:07:30,343 --> 01:07:33,210
Look! That red button.
It looks like an off switch.

1091
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:36,144
- We have to get up to that control panel.
- The pyramid.

1092
01:07:36,316 --> 01:07:38,580
- From the cat-lady house.
- Good thinking.

1093
01:07:38,752 --> 01:07:40,379
- You know what to do.
- Right!

1094
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,150
Wait! What are you doing?

1095
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:53,730
I can't reach it! Now what?

1096
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,164
Ta-da! It's a bird. It's a plane.

1097
01:07:56,336 --> 01:07:58,429
Nope, had it right the first time.

1098
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:01,333
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pigeon to the rescue.

1099
01:08:05,879 --> 01:08:09,576
Here I come!

1100
01:08:10,617 --> 01:08:11,641
No!

1101
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:13,308
I mean, thank you.

1102
01:08:14,387 --> 01:08:15,547
Wait!

1103
01:08:16,323 --> 01:08:19,588
You fools! Not every red button
is an off switch.

1104
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:22,054
So buckle up, kiddies.

1105
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:26,562
The real ride has just begun.

1106
01:08:35,608 --> 01:08:37,041
The signal's fired.

1107
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:39,440
The satellite's uploading
the Call of the Wild.

1108
01:08:39,612 --> 01:08:41,773
Butch? Butch are you there? Talk to me!

1109
01:08:41,948 --> 01:08:43,245
<i>Come in!</i>

1110
01:08:46,987 --> 01:08:48,045
Lou, come in!

1111
01:08:49,723 --> 01:08:52,988
- We've lost HQ!
- I suggest we just tag out and call it a day.

1112
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:54,956
Diggs! Any ideas?

1113
01:08:58,365 --> 01:08:59,696
If I get up to those wires...

1114
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:02,460
...I can disconnect them
and shut this thing down!

1115
01:09:02,936 --> 01:09:06,064
Then here. You're gonna need this.

1116
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:09,172
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1117
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:11,506
And don't scratch it!

1118
01:09:16,182 --> 01:09:18,980
What do you say, Catherine?
Feel like going for a ride?

1119
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:20,517
Let's do this.

1120
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:22,917
Collar: Grappling hook!

1121
01:09:25,392 --> 01:09:27,223
Whoo-hoo!

1122
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:29,385
Collar: Retract.

1123
01:09:41,174 --> 01:09:42,436
Diggs!

1124
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:44,201
What the...?

1125
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:46,843
Oh, my...

1126
01:09:50,183 --> 01:09:52,117
Meow.

1127
01:09:52,285 --> 01:09:56,619
Whoo! A robot cat.
I know what I want for Christmas.

1128
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:58,348
Like my new invention?

1129
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:00,891
Amazing what you can do
with a few spare parts...

1130
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:03,154
...and a thirst to destroy mankind.

1131
01:10:03,863 --> 01:10:05,160
My collar!

1132
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:07,822
- Let's go!
Right behind you.

1133
01:10:11,071 --> 01:10:12,368
This is futile!

1134
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:15,906
We're seconds away from
a world full of barking-mad canines.

1135
01:10:16,076 --> 01:10:18,840
And you're too late to stop it!

1136
01:10:25,318 --> 01:10:26,342
It's happening!

1137
01:10:26,519 --> 01:10:30,478
The Call of the Wild has hit London,
New York, Albuquerque!

1138
01:10:30,657 --> 01:10:32,989
That leaves less than a minute
till it's overhead.

1139
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,093
Come on, guys. You can do this.

1140
01:10:35,528 --> 01:10:39,624
We're almost at the wires!
- Something's wrong with my collar!

1141
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:42,826
Then it's time for Plan B!

1142
01:10:43,236 --> 01:10:46,467
I hate Plan B!

1143
01:10:46,639 --> 01:10:49,938
Okay, on my count. Three, two, one...

1144
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,577
...jump!

1145
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:58,347
Booyah.

1146
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:02,045
That was your plan to stop me?

1147
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:04,952
When this is over,
you'll be the first to be locked up.

1148
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:08,925
Sister, this dog is never
going back to the kennels.

1149
01:11:09,596 --> 01:11:11,325
- You again?
Come here.

1150
01:11:11,498 --> 01:11:12,829
Whoa.

1151
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:17,135
You wanna bite something, pal?
Bite this.

1152
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:24,269
What? Wait! No! No!

1153
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:33,274
No!

1154
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:36,945
You think I'm finished? Never!

1155
01:11:37,123 --> 01:11:40,524
It'll take more than some dogs
and a cat to stop me!

1156
01:11:41,227 --> 01:11:42,956
I've had it!

1157
01:11:45,231 --> 01:11:46,562
How about a mouse?

1158
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:50,759
Scrumptious? What...? No.

1159
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:53,098
Scrumptious!

1160
01:11:53,673 --> 01:11:54,731
Bye-bye!

1161
01:11:58,144 --> 01:11:59,441
Help me.

1162
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:00,904
Mom?

1163
01:12:05,084 --> 01:12:06,949
Watch out! It's gonna blow!

1164
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,987
Abandon ride!
Let's get out of here!

1165
01:12:34,714 --> 01:12:37,376
Thank you, San Francisco!

1166
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:40,382
Do you feel that, Kitty?
Do you feel the love?

1167
01:12:56,603 --> 01:12:59,231
Come on, boy. Come on.

1168
01:13:14,554 --> 01:13:16,215
Diggs?

1169
01:13:17,156 --> 01:13:18,646
Diggs!

1170
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:21,356
I'm glad to see you too, buddy!
Come here!

1171
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:23,188
Well, there's my big boy.

1172
01:13:23,563 --> 01:13:25,428
How did you get here?

1173
01:13:26,232 --> 01:13:27,529
Hey, Diggs, listen to me.

1174
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:31,531
I am so sorry that I didn't
stick up for you more.

1175
01:13:32,272 --> 01:13:34,706
I promise that will never happen again.
You hear me?

1176
01:13:36,142 --> 01:13:39,111
Welcome home, buddy.
Come on. Let's go inside.

1177
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:40,746
Come on, Diggsy!

1178
01:13:41,014 --> 01:13:44,347
Honey, you're not gonna believe
who I just found.

1179
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:54,055
Looks like someone
made a new best friend.

1180
01:13:54,727 --> 01:13:56,456
Here you go, boy.

1181
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:59,425
He's like a new dog.

1182
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:01,794
Think he misses being a cop?

1183
01:14:02,168 --> 01:14:05,695
Trust me, honey,
excitement's the last thing on his mind.

1184
01:14:06,439 --> 01:14:09,101
Zoe, do you want to join us at the table?

1185
01:14:09,275 --> 01:14:10,799
Huh?

1186
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:14,303
Hm.

1187
01:14:16,316 --> 01:14:17,783
<i>Alert, Agent Diggs.</i>

1188
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,282
<i>Your mission,
should you decide to accept it...</i>

1189
01:14:20,453 --> 01:14:22,114
<i>... will be revealed at HQ.</i>

1190
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:25,746
<i>This squirrel will self-destruct.
But first, a little dance.</i>

1191
01:14:31,197 --> 01:14:32,289
<i>All right, I'm done.</i>

1192
01:14:58,825 --> 01:15:01,316
- Talk to me.
- Our firewall's been breached.

1193
01:15:01,494 --> 01:15:02,791
Somebody hacked the system.

1194
01:15:02,962 --> 01:15:05,760
Hacked the system?
Who? How's that even possible?

1195
01:15:05,932 --> 01:15:08,662
Only one mastermind could do that.
But he's in...

1196
01:15:13,806 --> 01:15:16,104
Oh, gee, not this guy again.

1197
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:19,540
<i>Greetings, my furry friends!
It is I, Tinkles!</i>

1198
01:15:19,746 --> 01:15:22,544
<i>Free! Scot-free! Meow, meow.</i>

1199
01:15:22,749 --> 01:15:25,946
<i>Did you really think the Rock
could hold me forever?</i>

1200
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:28,087
<i>I am definitely not an indoor cat.</i>

1201
01:15:29,789 --> 01:15:33,384
<i>Hey, Ringo, enough with the steel drums
here! I'm trying to talk, "mon"!</i>

1202
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:36,494
<i>Hey, boss, I'm riffing. Heh-heh!</i>

1203
01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:40,994
<i>I'm going to enjoy this game
of cat and mouse.</i>

1204
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:43,294
<i>Or shall I say cat and cat...</i>

1205
01:15:43,469 --> 01:15:44,993
<i>... and dog...</i>

1206
01:15:45,171 --> 01:15:48,766
<i>You have the little bird there too, right?
Wow, it's like a whole petting zoo.</i>

1207
01:15:49,075 --> 01:15:52,670
<i>Anyway, come and get me, if you dare!</i>

1208
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:57,711
<i>Meow, meow.</i>

1209
01:15:58,351 --> 01:16:00,182
All right, team. We got work to do.

1210
01:16:00,353 --> 01:16:01,650
You're not going anywhere.

1211
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:03,186
What? Why not?

1212
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:05,582
Because you don't have
your new collar...

1213
01:16:05,892 --> 01:16:07,052
...agent.

1214
01:16:08,428 --> 01:16:11,158
Go ahead with your bad self. Bling!

1215
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,820
You guys ready to do this?

1216
01:16:12,999 --> 01:16:16,059
Work with a bunch of dogs again?
How could I say no?

1217
01:16:16,235 --> 01:16:18,066
Absolutely!

1218
01:16:18,237 --> 01:16:20,364
Wait. We're talking about lunch, right?

1219
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:24,309
All right, team. Let's go kick some tail!

1220
01:21:42,061 --> 01:21:44,029
<i>Come on! Why isn't this working?</i>

1221
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:47,529
<i>Hey, hey! Help me with my e-mail.
I gotta reach my vet.</i>

1222
01:21:47,733 --> 01:21:49,997
<i>I gotta get me some of that
deworming cream.</i>

1223
01:21:50,169 --> 01:21:53,730
<i>Tropical heat makes my butt itch
like you wouldn't belie... Wait.</i>

1224
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,401
<i>What's this green light for?</i>

1225
01:21:56,742 --> 01:21:59,711
<i>- This thing supposed to be on?
- Boss, you're still connected.</i>

1226
01:21:59,879 --> 01:22:02,677
<i>So everything I'm...
But, like... So they can still...</i>

1227
01:22:02,848 --> 01:22:04,372
<i>Rash.</i>

1228
01:22:04,683 --> 01:22:09,017
<i>Uh... So the cream?
Oh. Wow. Um...</i>

1229
01:22:09,188 --> 01:22:11,349
<i>Cats rule! Yeah.</i>
