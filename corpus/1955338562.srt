         [applause]

7
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,837
      All right; thank you.

8
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,873
     Thank you very much.

9
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,308
      Thanks, you guys;
      that's very nice.

10
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,376
         Thank you.

11
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,178
        How you doing,
          all right?

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,047
              Good.

13
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,782
     Good; this is good.
         You're out.

14
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,517
     Being out is good.

15
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,485
            It is.

16
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,720
     I don't go out anymore.

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,988
     I have a baby now,
     so I don't go out.

18
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,823
  Some of you have babies,
  but you don't love them,

19
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:01,693
         so you're here;
          that's cool.

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,495
  No, I mostly just go out
      with my daughter.

21
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,631
       I went to the park
     with her the other day.

22
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,600
  I was at this park and--
    New York City park--

23
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,803
and they had these "No Drinking"
       signs at the park,

24
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,738
     but it doesn't say,
       "No Drinking."

25
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,606
 It has a picture of, like,
       a martini glass

26
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,609
     with a line through it.

27
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,812
 Are those really the people
    causing the problems

28
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,047
      with the drinking
        in the parks?

29
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,551
        Are they reaching
      their target audience

30
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,486
      with a martini glass,
             really?

31
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,088
  Shouldn't there be, like,
      a bottle in a bag

32
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,756
     with a line through it?

33
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,192
Do you see people at this park
    at 4:00 in the morning:

34
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,627
     "Hey, motherfucker!"

35
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,039
    I try to go to movies,
 but movies are all shit now.

36
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,807
 They are; they're all shit.

37
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,110
     Like they just have
  this machine that just--

38
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,712
      just makes shit.

39
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,914
       I try to see--
      I rented a movie.

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,916
 I rented that Jesus movie,
  where they beat the shit

41
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,685
        out of Jesus
     for a couple hours.

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,253
  Wow, they kicked his ass.

43
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,488
        What happened?

44
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,089
      What, did he key
     somebody's Camaro?

45
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,592
     What did the guy do?

46
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,693
     Look, I didn't like
      the Jesus movie.

47
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,927
      I thought it was
       a shitty movie.

48
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,762
   And people get offended
  when you tell them that,

49
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,431
     like you're saying
      something wrong.

50
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,466
     It's like, "I thought
  the Jesus movie sucked."

51
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,667
      And they're like,
         "Hey, man."

52
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,535
           Like, what?
         He's not in it.

53
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:21,039
      Who gives a shit?

54
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,610
     Like Jesus cares about
  Mel Gibson's movie, you know.

55
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,846
  Look, I was raised Catholic,
  so I know He did that for me,

56
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,314
     and I appreciate it.

57
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,649
     You know, thank you.

58
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,117
 He should have asked first,
          you know.

59
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,418
     I would have said,
        "I'm all set;

60
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,087
  I don't need that done,"
          because--

61
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,755
    a little presumptuous.

62
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,390
         Only because--
     Look; here's the thing.

63
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,125
    I was raised Catholic,
     and I'm not anymore,

64
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,994
         because they--
     look, if they're right,

65
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,729
        I am fucked;
     I'm going to hell.

66
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,797
             I am,
    because I'm really a--

67
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,568
    I do wrong shit a lot.

68
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,671
       Man, it's really--
  I'm going to hell; I know it.

69
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,772
      And I don't want
        to go to hell,

70
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,008
     and really because
  I don't like new places.

71
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,576
  That's really the reason.

72
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,244
      'Cause I'm afraid
      I'll go to hell,

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,779
     I won't know where
     to sign up for shit,

74
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,315
    I'll be all confused--

75
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,951
  like the first day of school,
            you know?

76
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,020
  I wonder, is there, like,
     a schedule to hell?

77
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,656
        How organized
     is your damnation?

78
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,558
     Like, do they first--
 do they put you in one room,

79
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,030
 and some monster fucks you
 up the ass for 1,000 years?

80
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,364
          You come out,
          you're like,

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,168
 "They ain't fucking around
    in there, I tell you.

82
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,771
  "I don't recommend that room.

83
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,340
      That was a drag."

84
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,475
 Then they take you and they
  put you in another room,

85
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,311
    and they shit on you--
        or I don't know

86
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,179
        what the fuck
  they're doing down there,

87
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,747
     but what if hell's
       not like that?

88
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,616
  What if I'm just standing
 in a hallway in hell, like,

89
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:42,788
         "What do I do?
         Where do I go?"

90
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,223
 Some demon walks up to me.

91
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,490
        Hey, [growls].

92
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,993
          And I'm like,
          "Woo! Demon."

93
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,563
     And the demon's like,
  "Come on; suck my dick."

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,468
Now I'm blowing a demon in hell,
       and it's horrible.

95
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,470
          I'm thinking,
"I shouldn't have lied so much,"

96
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,439
         or whatever.

97
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,279
     But here's my question:

98
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:11,350
What if, when I'm done blowing
  the demon in the hallway--

99
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,018
    which, how do you know
       when you're done

100
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,486
         blowing a demon
         in the hallway?

101
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,923
I guess, when he comes fire ants
        on you, whatever.

102
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,793
    When I'm done blowing
  the demon in the hallway,

103
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,062
   what if some guy in charge
of hell walks up to me and goes,

104
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:30,469
      "Hey, man, you didn't
have to blow that guy, you know.

105
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,637
  "He just hangs out here.

106
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:38,210
"He's not part of your damnation
          or anything.

107
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,180
 What did you blow him for?"

108
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:46,918
I just assumed you're supposed
        to blow people.

109
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,221
  He said, "Suck my dick,"
      so I, you know--

110
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,790
        "So, say no.
 What's so hard about that?

111
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,125
             "Jesus.

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,526
         "Look, man;
  you better pace yourself.

113
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,962
 "You're down here forever.

114
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,697
     "You're gonna blow
        a lot of demons

115
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,433
      "and elephants--
     all kinds of shit.

116
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:09,041
  Don't be freelancing in the
hallways, for Christ's sakes."

117
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,876
     And also, you gotta die
         to go to hell,

118
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,144
  and I don't want to die.

119
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,779
         I like my life;
         I'm very happy.

120
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,314
        I'm married,
     and I love my wife.

121
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,581
      I love her very much.

122
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,183
      My wife hates me.

123
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,651
      She fucking hates me.

124
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:23,088
      She hates me so much.

125
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,423
 Like, that's what she does.

126
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,058
   Like, if you asked her,
  "What did you do today?"

127
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,527
  "I fucking hate that guy;
  that's what I did today.

128
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,363
        I hate Louis."

129
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,465
     She is so mad at me
        all the time.

130
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
  Here's the latest thing:
       the other day,

131
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,001
     she got really mad;
       she said to me,

132
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,169
     "You know what you did?

133
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,137
 "You filled the dishwasher
        with dishes,

134
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:43,075
    you put the soap in,
 and you didn't turn it on."

135
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,712
          And I'm like,
          "Oh, shit.

136
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,715
  What are we going to do now?"

137
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,487
  But here's the part where she
         blows my mind.

138
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,322
        This is amazing
 when she gets to this level.

139
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,859
      She says, "Well,
 why didn't you turn it on?"

140
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:06,064
     Like I have a reason
    for not turning it on.

141
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,301
        And I'm like,
  "Can't I just be stupid?

142
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,770
      "Can't it just be
  that I'm a fucking idiot,

143
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,272
"that I filled the dishwasher,
    and then I went, 'Duh,'

144
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,275
     and I walked away?"

145
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,343
      I can live with that.

146
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,011
     I'm cool with that.

147
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,847
         But she says,
    "No, why'd you do it?"

148
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,216
      Which means I decided
          not to do it.

149
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:28,353
   Do you know how much more
 of an asshole that makes me?

150
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,354
     That means I filled
       the dishwasher,

151
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,622
      and then I went,
       "You know what?

152
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:36,161
           "Fuck her;
     I ain't turning it on."

153
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,463
      "She can suck my dick
          if she thinks

154
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,499
          "I'm pressing
         that On button.

155
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,567
 "I'll fill it, but I don't
      fucking press On;

156
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,969
      not in my own house."

157
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,638
     Why would I do that?

158
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,940
     That would be crazy.

159
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,112
     The thing that she's
 usually mad about is simple.

160
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:57,783
 She says that I don't listen
 to her when she's talking.

161
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,218
         And I don't,

162
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,854
 but it's not because I don't
  love her, blah, blah, blah;

163
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,758
        it's because--

164
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,260
      I try to listen;
        I really do.

165
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,995
       When she talks,
  I just stare at her face.

166
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,599
     I'm like, "Come on,
      bring the story."

167
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,401
    But somehow, I'm like,
        "What the f--"

168
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,370
        I can't do it;
           I tried.

169
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,306
 'Cause every story gets divided
         into 50 stories

170
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,341
     that all branch out
     into these crazy--

171
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,211
          And I'm like,
          "Holy shit."

172
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,913
         I've got ADD;
        I can't do it.

173
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,416
          I'm like,
      "Fucking please."

174
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,118
         But I try--
      Every time I try,

175
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,653
        because I love
     this retarded woman,

176
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:40,826
    so I try really hard
  to listen to her stories.

177
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,360
 Other people don't even try.

178
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,162
      We go to parties,
     she starts talking,

179
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,964
 people just walk away like,
         "Fuck this.

180
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,833
     "That lady's crazy.

181
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,202
    Who would waste time
  listening to that crap?"

182
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,637
             Me.

183
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,905
     She can't help it.

184
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,674
 I really feel bad for her,
    because the thing is

185
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,509
  that every word of this story
       gets her so excited

186
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,978
  that she wants to fucking
        run with it.

187
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,481
 She can't fucking just break
  through and get to the end,

188
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,782
    or even the beginning.

189
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,083
     This is my wife telling
            a story:

190
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,052
She's like, "Guess what happened
        to my mom today.

191
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,954
"You remember I told you my mom,
  how when she was in college--

192
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,156
 "Not when she went to Michigan;
      when she transferred.

193
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,891
         "Remember,
  'cause that guy got weird

194
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,292
     "nd she had to leave
        'cause he was--

195
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,328
    "Not the Iranian guy;
 that was a different story.

196
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,929
      "That guy--actually,
     I think he was Persian.

197
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,764
     I heard that Persia
      actually split--"

198
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,401
         What the fuck
    are you talking about?

199
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,341
          Jesus Christ!

200
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,443
          Pick a thing!

201
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,882
    Have some consideration
  for the fucking listener.

202
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,016
      I don't do that.

203
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,551
 Here's me telling a story:

204
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:44,756
       "I bought a tomato,
 and I ate it, and it was good."

205
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,791
       That's a story
     anyone can follow.

206
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:53,298
     It's about a tomato
       the whole time.

207
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,799
  I like being married, though.

208
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,734
     I do; I really like it.

209
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,835
         I seriously do.

210
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,003
     We were having sex--
        my wife and I--

211
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,337
    a couple of weeks ago,

212
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,906
      which is amazing,
      that we did that,

213
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,174
 because we never have sex.

214
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,543
            Never.

215
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,678
     Because we have a baby,
and our baby's a fucking asshole

216
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,347
 and won't let us have sex.

217
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,651
 No, fuck--that kid's a jerk,
        man, seriously.

218
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,554
      Every time, she's got
  some urgent shit in her room.

219
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,588
      "Papa, come in here!"

220
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,689
         "I a min--"
           "Now!"

221
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,558
    "Okay." I go in there;
         "What's up?"

222
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,661
     "I need a pair of pants
       to put on my pony."

223
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:27,098
     [with mock concern]
       Wow. Holy shit.

224
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,533
 I'm trying to fuck your mom
          in there.

225
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,869
      Would you give me
          a break?

226
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,373
  Can't a guy fuck your mom
        for a minute?

227
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:39,945
      There is no sex, man.

228
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,681
I had no idea that marriage just
          means no sex.

229
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,317
     No, none, fucking none.

230
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,152
I have friends that are thinking
       of getting married,

231
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,653
  and they say funny shit like,

232
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,422
        "Hey, you know,
I don't know if I could do it,

233
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,957
      "because I don't know
      if I could have sex

234
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,525
       with one woman
  for the rest of my life."

235
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:58,129
           I'm like,
"Don't worry about that shit."

236
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,965
  You're going to have sex
       with zero women

237
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,633
 for the rest of your life.

238
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,501
 That's a lot less than one.

239
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,136
     One woman--who the fuck
      do you think you are?

240
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,939
  Where'd you get that fantasy?

241
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,741
     I'd love to have sex
        with one woman

242
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,776
  for the rest of my life--
       <i> any</i> one woman.

243
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,378
      Big fat dead lady
       with a beard--

244
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,413
     I'd fuck her every day.

245
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:19,818
  I'd be proud to have her.

246
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,286
     That's not usually
         my problem.

247
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,455
         These days,
 my problem is very simple.

248
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,390
 It's trying to find a place
         in my house

249
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,426
    where I can masturbate
without somebody bothering me.

250
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:32,163
     And that's getting
      really difficult.

251
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,431
         There's nowhere
         to go anymore.

252
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,067
  She's got her mother staying
 with us too, in the guest room,

253
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,202
 and I'm on the streets now.

254
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,204
     I got nowhere to go.

255
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,672
      Like, now I know,
      when I see a guy

256
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,108
    on the West Side Highway
 jerking off in plain daylight--

257
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,342
 That's not a homeless guy;

258
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,812
     that's a married man
         right there.

259
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,381
     He's got nowhere to go.

260
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,515
     "Fuck it--Fuck you.

261
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,384
  "Go ahead and look, man;
    I got nothing to hide.

262
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,622
 What else am I going to do?"

263
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,690
     It's not fair, man.

264
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,291
  I'm 37 and I own my home.

265
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,293
I should be able to just stand
      in the living room:

266
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,361
      "How you doing honey?

267
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,031
        Good morning."

268
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,432
         But I can't.

269
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,433
      I've got to hide.

270
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,868
    I'm down in the cellar
        by the boiler,

271
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,037
  like a troll down there.

272
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,040
          [growls]

273
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,474
     Just fucking miserable.

274
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,609
         "Oh, shit."

275
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,978
    That's what it's like.

276
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,946
 Masturbation doesn't bring
      much joy to guys.

277
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,648
           Women seem
      to like masturbating.

278
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,383
    They put flower petals
        on the pillow.

279
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,853
          They're like,
"Ah, me," or whatever, you know.

280
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,859
     The guys are like,
         "Ah, shit."

281
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,428
         [muttering]

282
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,596
        "God damn it."

283
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,765
 Sometimes you find ecstasy,
      but it's followed

284
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,334
    by the deepest self-hate
and depression you've ever felt.

285
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,704
      It's an amazing drop
      from way up here to--

286
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,405
    It's like, "Oh, yeah--

287
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,940
     "Oh--what the fuck
      is wrong with me?

288
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:53,845
          "God damn it.

289
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
      "I gotta get to work.

290
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:59,784
      I don't have time
  for this shit right now."

291
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,525
  But then you get married;
    now you've got to hide.

292
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,560
      And you have to.

293
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,028
      You have to hide.

294
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,663
Because when your wife catches
       you masturbating,

295
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,932
           that's sad
      for the whole family.

296
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,100
         That's not--

297
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,570
      not a good moment
       in a marriage.

298
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:23,174
  She comes in the cellar:
        "Oh, my God."

299
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,080
  And then she always wants
   to know shit about it.

300
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,281
  She always asks me stuff.

301
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,417
        My wife's like,
 "Well, do you think about me

302
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,019
  when you're doing that?"

303
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,287
          What are you,
          fucking high?

304
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,022
     Why would I do that?

305
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,324
              Why--

306
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,458
 I can think about anybody.

307
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,894
         That's magical.

308
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,662
    Why the fuck would I--
      I'm married to you.

309
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,798
    Do women really think
  their husbands are going,

310
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,801
          "Oh, my wife.
  Oh, yeah, that's fucking hot.

311
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,136
         "Oh, yeah.

312
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,171
"Picking her up at the airport
    and getting yelled at:

313
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,873
  "Oh, that's fucking hot.

314
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,508
            "Yeah.

315
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,010
     "'Put it in the hamper,
     not on top, you idiot.'

316
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,411
         "Oh, I love
  when she talks like that.

317
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,783
            Yeah."

318
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,951
          But you know,
            whatever.

319
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,686
         We're a family;
         we have a kid.

320
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,854
  That changes everything.

321
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,256
     That's the whole thing.

322
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,390
    The kid is everything.

323
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,858
     Marriage is nothing.

324
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,627
       Without a kid,
     marriage is dating.

325
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,061
      It doesn't mean shit.

326
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,863
  And you don't realize it
    till you have a kid.

327
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,498
      Here's what happens:
      when you get married,

328
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,634
     you go, "Holy shit;
     I can't leave now.

329
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,202
            "I mean,
  I wasn't thinking of leaving,

330
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,304
            but now
    I really can't leave."

331
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,742
 Then you have a kid and you go,
  "Holy shit; I could've left."

332
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,351
 I totally could have left.

333
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,187
  Fucking door was right there.

334
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,922
         Now I can't go.

335
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,491
        Got a kid now.

336
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,692
     No, I love my daughter.

337
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,960
 It's a lot of responsibility

338
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,361
 that you never think about,
           though.

339
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,629
      Like, you've got
      to name your kid.

340
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,931
      That's a big deal
        right there.

341
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,566
          And you know
      what's amazing to me?

342
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,835
      You can name your kid
      anything you want.

343
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,836
    Isn't that incredible?

344
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,004
     There are no laws.

345
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,974
        There should be
      a couple of laws.

346
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,275
              None.

347
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,877
        You can literally
     name your kid anything.

348
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,846
 You can name your kid a name
  with no vowels if you want,

349
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,281
        like Pnsndltn.

350
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,985
      Dpppppthfffffffff

351
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,086
          ffffffffffff.

352
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,088
         Just 40 Fs:
      that's his name.

353
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:21,926
      "Ffffffffffffffffffff
      ffffffffffffffffffff,

354
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,695
     go clean your room."

355
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,301
          [laughs]

356
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,904
 Some people name their kids
    a word, like Sunshine

357
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:38,710
     or Battery or whatever.

358
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,545
    I'd like to name my kid
  a whole phrase, you know.

359
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,080
         Something like
      Ladies And Gentlemen.

360
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,983
  That would be a cool name
         for a kid.

361
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:52,323
       "This is my son,
    Ladies And Gentlemen."

362
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,825
Then when he gets out of hand,
         I get to go,

363
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,228
 "Ladies And Gentlemen, please!"

364
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,870
 But you've got to be careful
    what you name your kid.

365
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,839
 You do have to be careful,
  because what happens is,

366
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,807
     other kids in school
are going to make fun of them.

367
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,342
  They're going to make fun
       of their name.

368
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,077
 And you don't have to give them
          a weird name,

369
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,479
    because they can do it
        with any name.

370
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,147
 Kids are geniuses at that.

371
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,783
     Any name--they take it;
      they go Louis Screwy,

372
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,318
         Joey Blowy,

373
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,186
 Mike Your Mother's a Dyke,
          whatever.

374
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,156
      They find a way,
         these kids.

375
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,724
           Any name--
     Like, what's your name?

376
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,793
 Eric--You Fucking Asshole.

377
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,262
     See? Just like that.

378
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,932
         Lightning speed
         these kids got.

379
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,200
      What's your name?

380
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,635
     Joe--Eat a Bag of Shit,
            Cuntface.

381
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,671
  You see? Just like that.

382
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,806
He got that all through school
    and cried like a pussy.

383
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:46,344
  It's not going to happen
     to my little girl.

384
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,913
      My daughter is really
      something else, man.

385
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,915
 She's--She runs the house.

386
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,216
  She runs the whole house.

387
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,584
     She decides everything.

388
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,586
     Like, we were playing
 hide-and-seek the other day.

389
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,189
    We play hide-and-seek,
  and we play by her rules

390
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,991
     that she invented.

391
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,392
     And do you know why?

392
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,128
      Because she sucks
      at hide-and-seek.

393
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,364
     And so she covers it
    with this fucking ruse

394
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,499
 to level the playing fields.

395
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,468
 And I gotta fucking pretend
         it's all--

396
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,705
      that she's great.

397
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,539
     No, it's bullshit.

398
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,474
      Like, we're playing--

399
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,376
          No, fucking--

400
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:23,681
     I know she's a kid,
     but fucking listen.

401
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:28,086
 When it's my turn to hide,
 she tells me where to hide.

402
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,354
     She tells me where.

403
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,788
She goes, "Hide in the closet,
            Papa."

404
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,156
      But you're going
      to know where I--

405
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,057
      "Hide in the closet!"

406
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,726
        All right--fuck--
     I'll hide I the closet.

407
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,261
         Good, fine.

408
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:41,332
Now I'm standing in the closet
       like an asshole.

409
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,234
         She comes in.
        "I found you."

410
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,436
  She's, like, shitty about it,
      like, "I found you."

411
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,973
     And I'm like, "Wow.

412
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,244
  "How did you figure out where
  you told me to fucking hide?"

413
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,152
  And then when she hides--
     this is her hiding.

414
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,087
     She goes over to a wall
         and does this.

415
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,156
         She goes--

416
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,557
         That's it.

417
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,660
      There's nothing here.

418
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,263
    What the fuck is this?

419
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,768
      Like this is some
 ninja invisibility crouch.

420
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,903
     And I've got to act
       like an idiot.

421
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:22,106
 I can't just walk in and go,
     "Yeah, you're there."

422
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,009
      'Cause she'll cry
 and shit her pants, right?

423
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,477
 So I've got to walk around
      like an asshole:

424
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,845
        "Where is she?

425
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,814
      "I have no idea.

426
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,951
     Where could she be?"

427
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,952
     I'm making eye contact.

428
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,656
     "I don't see her."

429
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,592
     It's amazing to me.

430
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,827
         The other day,
         we're playing--

431
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,729
This is how things have gotten
      in my house, okay?

432
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,697
 Here's a very good example
     of where it's gone.

433
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,332
     We're playing a version
        of hide-and-seek

434
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,001
  where my wife and I have
     to decide together

435
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,702
         where to look,
     because she likes that.

436
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,438
       She's like, "Mama,
  you tell Papa where to look."

437
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,972
         Okay, fine.

438
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,474
     So she's over there,
       hiding like this,

439
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,676
      just in plain sight,
     and my wife and I are--

440
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,212
My wife's like, "Why don't you
     look under the bed?"

441
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,916
      I'm like, "Okay.

442
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,452
      She's not there."

443
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,054
 And then she says, "Why don't
you look in the linen closet?"

444
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,756
 Okay; so I open the closet.

445
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,357
            She goes,
  "That's not the linen closet.

446
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,959
      We don't put that
     in there anymore."

447
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,462
     All right, fucking--
       Jesus, all right.

448
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,896
     So I look in anoth--

449
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,598
 Why would she be in that closet
        that has shelves?

450
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,500
 She can't stand in a shelf.

451
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,968
 "Well, maybe she's crawled
         in a sh--"

452
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,070
  Now we're having a fight
     about where to look

453
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,639
    for this fucking kid
 who's standing right there.

454
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,051
 She totally runs the house.

455
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,587
     I remember Halloween
          last year--

456
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,988
      A couple of days
      before Halloween,

457
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,456
     my wife comes up to me,
         and she's like,

458
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:49,460
        [whispering]
     "We have to get you
       a cat costume."

459
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:53,097
      No, no, we don't,
          actually.

460
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,199
"No, we do, because she thinks
  you're going to be a cat."

461
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,434
     It's like she's got a--

462
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,969
    she's a guy with a gun
      in the other room.

463
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,403
    That's what it's like.

464
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,739
 She's like, "Jess thinks you're
       going to be a cat.

465
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,241
        "I don't know how
     she got it in her head,

466
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:07,445
    but she's expecting you
 to be a cat on Halloween."

467
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,247
 I just go, "Well, tell her
     to go fuck herself,

468
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,948
 because I'm not doing it."

469
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,085
    I'm not afraid of her.

470
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,053
           She's two;
     I'll fucking fight her.

471
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,190
      I could take her.

472
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,959
   I could beat the shit out
of thousands of two-year-olds.

473
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,463
          All day--
      just walk around.

474
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,864
      They would never even
         gang up on me.

475
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,865
         They suck.

476
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,835
    I'm not afraid of her.

477
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,239
  So my wife decided that she
  wanted to get pregnant again.

478
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,574
         She decided it.

479
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,942
          And she--
  this was back in August.

480
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,012
   She told me, "You need
  to be in town next week."

481
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,480
             Why?

482
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,882
      "Because I'm get--
you know, I'm ovulating, so--"

483
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,384
         Like, not,
 "Do you want another kid?"

484
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,586
     Just, "Be in town;"
 that's how she handles it.

485
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,454
  I'm like, "I'm not going to--
    I don't want another kid,

486
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,789
         so fuck it."

487
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:52,990
         And she's like,
          "All right."

488
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,892
           Next week,
  she starts blowing me, right?

489
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,694
  Now, she hasn't blown me in--

490
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,763
     Jesus, I don't know
  if I've ever been blown.

491
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,065
    That's how long it is.

492
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,967
      She's blowing me
 on the day she's ovulating.

493
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,235
     I'm a fucking idiot.

494
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,536
           I'm like,
     "Yeah, you love it."

495
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:12,310
         Like, I think
      she digs me now.

496
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,980
         Fucking stupid.

497
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:16,981
  So she's having another baby.

498
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,849
     Any day now, she's due.

499
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,750
         It's true.

500
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:20,685
         She's fucking--

501
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,687
  Fucking--the whole thing.

502
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:23,721
        And I'm like--

503
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,056
         [muttering]

504
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:26,490
            "Okay.

505
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,059
     No, no, it's great."

506
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,126
          [laughs]
          Fuck it.

507
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,661
          Fuck it.

508
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,064
  That's really the attitude
  that keeps a family together.

509
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,999
It's not "we love each other;"
      it's "fuck it, man.

510
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,400
          "Fuck it.

511
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,569
          Fuck it."

512
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,770
          Another kid--
            Fuck it.

513
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,038
          Why not?
      Let them all in.

514
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,039
              Good.

515
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,408
          Fuck it.

516
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,977
     But the problem is,
  we have no fucking money.

517
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,912
  I don't know where she thinks
    the money's coming from.

518
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,146
         We're so broke.

519
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,848
 I'm so sick of being broke.

520
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,251
I'm broke all--I'm just always--
  just keep digging this hole.

521
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,219
And most people are broke too;
       that's the thing.

522
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,921
      This country's just--
      everybody's broke.

523
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,656
      That's why I don't--
 Look, I don't like George Bush,

524
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,291
 but I didn't like Kerry either,
         because they're

525
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,826
      fucking both rich,
    and they don't get it.

526
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,061
       They don't know
 what it's like to be poor.

527
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,497
   Like, poor people know
 what it's like to be rich.

528
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,132
      They know exactly
        what it's like,

529
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,702
    because they fantasize
     about it constantly.

530
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:17,241
   Every poor person has their
whole rich life all planned out.

531
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,943
          Every detail.

532
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,013
     "I'm gonna have a house
       made of chocolate.

533
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,115
 "People are going to blow me
    as I walk in each room.

534
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,550
 "They're gonna be waiting.

535
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,386
  "I'm going to wipe my ass
      with live rabbits

536
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:34,659
        and throw them
      out the window."

537
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,628
    Got it all worked out.

538
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,563
 But rich people don't fantasize
        about being poor.

539
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,965
        Why the fuck
     would they do that?

540
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,768
 "I'll have to take the bus
     everywhere--yeah!"

541
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,774
    I've always been poor,
        my whole life.

542
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,142
         I've fucking
     never had any money.

543
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,743
     And I--I don't care;
     I don't give a shit.

544
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,278
 But there's a lot of people
     that are poor now.

545
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,113
     Like, I was driving
  through upstate New York,

546
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,081
 and there's people up there,
             man,

547
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,649
 their lives are just shitty.

548
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,318
 Like, you ever drive through
         a whole town,

549
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,586
  and you're like, "What, did a
 shit bomb go off in this place?

550
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,821
         What happened?"

551
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,423
    Everybody's life sucks
      in the whole town.

552
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,957
        And you can tell,
  because they're just standing

553
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,295
 in front of their houses like--

554
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,664
     They're just bleak.

555
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,200
  And a lot of people call
  those people white trash.

556
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,568
              And--

557
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,136
     I love that expression,
         "white trash,"

558
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,739
 because it's the only racial
  expression that you can use

559
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,074
  and nobody gets offended.

560
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,909
     Nobody gives a shit.

561
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,477
 When you say "white trash,"
        nobody goes,

562
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,145
      "Hey, don't talk like
        that about them.

563
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,513
      That's not nice."

564
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,949
 Nobody defends white trash.

565
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,251
You could be talking to the most
  liberal hippie in the world.

566
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,420
  You go, "Hey, I saw this guy;
      he was white trash."

567
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:40,624
      He'll go, "Ha-ha!
       Fuck that guy.

568
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
     White-trash loser."

569
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,665
      No, I don't know;
 I just wanna be a good dad,

570
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
     raise my daughter.

571
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:50,868
 It's a complicated country.

572
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,036
      People get angry,
          you know.

573
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,404
     And everybody hates
       gay people now.

574
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,239
  I never understood anger
     towards gay people,

575
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,308
 because a person being gay
  doesn't affect your life,

576
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,943
       so it's weird to me
     that people just like--

577
00:22:58,978 --> 00:22:59,777
  They're in their homes going,

578
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:03,247
     "Oh, people are gay.

579
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,651
          Damn it."

580
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,019
      What do you care?

581
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,921
    I can understand hating
  gay people if, say, like,

582
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,790
  you're mowing your lawn,
        and two guys

583
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,492
    are blowing each other
      right on the grass.

584
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,694
  "Oh, I got to cut around
  you faggots every Sunday.

585
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,164
     I'm sick of this shit."

586
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,603
 Or, say you're eating your
  breakfast in the morning,

587
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,638
 and you're about to put your
   spoon in the cereal bowl,

588
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,407
  and two guys touch dicks
    right in front of you.

589
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:36,113
        "Hey, come on!

590
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,782
      "I gotta get to work.

591
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,552
 "I don't have time to dodge
  your dicks with my spoon.

592
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,422
         Fucking homos--
     get out of my kitchen."

593
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,593
 I hope I'm a better parent
    than my parents were.

594
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,028
          My parents
    were not good parents.

595
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,097
        My parents--
  here's a typical example.

596
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,698
      This is a true story,
         I swear to God.

597
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,967
  My parents sent me to summer
 camp when I was in third grade.

598
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,035
  It's a good idea, right?

599
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,537
        But they didn't
     look into the camps.

600
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,373
       They just chose one
out of the phone book, randomly.

601
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,542
     And I swear to God,
       this happened.

602
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:08,112
  I get there; it's a camp
    for all retarded kids.

603
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:12,716
         I swear to God.

604
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:15,352
       I went to camp
     for retarded kids.

605
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,620
         I swear to God.

606
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,289
      I'll never forget,
      the moment I arrived,

607
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,325
I looked around, and I realized,
          "Holy shit...

608
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,929
        "I'm retarded.

609
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,467
    "I didn't think I was,
        but I must be.

610
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,635
            "How am I
     the only kid who's not?

611
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,270
         "This is how
    they chose to tell me?

612
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,972
         This is it?"

613
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,407
 "Just send him to the camp.

614
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,909
           "Fuck it;
     he'll figure it out.

615
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,978
       He's retarded;
      he's not stupid."

616
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,582
      I loved it there;
        it was great.

617
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,283
       Everybody's nice,
     every game is a tie,

618
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,618
      just gold medals
        for everybody.

619
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,421
         It was awesome.

620
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,889
      Here's the thing:

621
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,725
 I never, never, never, never
   judge other parents now.

622
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:55,860
         I never do.

623
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,261
 I used to, but I never do.

624
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,096
 Like, you know when you see
   a mother in McDonald's

625
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,631
        or some place
     or in a toy store,

626
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,167
 and she's just melting down
         on her kid?

627
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:04,468
      She's like, "Shut up.
           I hate you.

628
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,037
          You're ugly."

629
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,340
And people are standing around
   going, "Oh, my goodness.

630
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,774
  She's a horrible mother."

631
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,042
      Well, guess what?

632
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,410
     Those people aren't
      fucking parents.

633
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,012
      They don't have kids.

634
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,114
 'Cause any parents who are
 in that store are thinking,

635
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:23,487
 "What did that shitty kid do
      to that poor woman?

636
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,288
      "That poor woman.

637
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,825
      I wish I could help."

638
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:31,028
 'Cause you don't know, man;
       you don't know.

639
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,197
Or like, when you see a parent
  that seems to be negligent.

640
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,698
    Like, you see a parent
         in McDonald's

641
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,133
         with the kid,
    and the parent's like,

642
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,868
        "I can't take
     this shit anymore."

643
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,803
    Just, like, collapsed.

644
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,906
  And all the shopping bags
 are just strewn everywhere.

645
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:42,773
     And the kid's happy.

646
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,542
The kid's eating french fries.

647
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,010
      And the kid asks
      a question like,

648
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,912
             "Mama,
      why is the sky blue?"

649
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,414
  And she's like, "Just shut up
  and eat your french fries."

650
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:54,051
       And you think,
  "What a terrible mother.

651
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,186
     "Why doesn't she answer
           her child?

652
00:25:56,255 --> 00:26:01,392
  "When I have a child, I will
  answer all of their questions

653
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:05,396
      and open their minds
  to the wonders of the world."

654
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,864
      Well guess what:

655
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,699
 you don't know what the fuck
     you're talking about.

656
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,034
      You can't answer
      a kid's question.

657
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,902
  They don't accept any answer.

658
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,904
        A kid never goes,
     "Oh, thanks; I get it."

659
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,040
 They fucking never say that.

660
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,107
    They just keep coming,
        more questions:

661
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,342
      "Why? Why? Why?"

662
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,244
   Till you don't even know
 who the fuck you are anymore

663
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,545
          at the end
     of the conversation.

664
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,414
It's an insane deconstruction.

665
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,082
         It's ama--

666
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,750
     This is my daughter
 the other day; she's like,

667
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,185
           "Papa,
  why can't we go outside?"

668
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,520
 Well, 'cause it's raining.

669
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,823
            "Why?"

670
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,593
      "Well, water's coming
        out of the sky."

671
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,928
            "Why?"

672
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,663
 "Because it was in a cloud."

673
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:40,898
            "Why?"

674
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:45,703
     "Well, clouds form
     when there's vapor."

675
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:53,310
            "Why?"

676
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,478
          I don't know.

677
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,615
          I don't know.
  I don't know any more things.

678
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:04,455
        Those are all
     the things I know.

679
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,125
            "Why?"

680
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,793
     'Cause I'm stupid,
            okay?

681
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,762
         I'm stupid.

682
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,397
            "Why?"

683
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,532
 Well, because I didn't pay
 attention in school, okay?

684
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,701
        I went to school,
  but I didn't listen in class.

685
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:18,802
            "Why?"

686
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:19,970
      'Cause I was high
        all the time.

687
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:23,307
    I smoked too much pot.

688
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,808
            "Why?"

689
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,310
       'Cause my parents
     gave me no guidance.

690
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,211
  They didn't give a shit.

691
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,545
            "Why?"

692
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:29,947
     'Cause they fucked
     in a car and had me,

693
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,382
      and they resented me
     for taking their youth.

694
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,050
            "Why?"

695
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,485
 Because they had bad morals.

696
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,953
  They just had no compass.

697
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,521
             "Why?"
 'Cause they had shitty parents.

698
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,089
     It just keeps going
         like that.

699
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,291
    "Why?" 'Cause fuck it;
 we're alone in the universe.

700
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,027
     Nobody gives a shit
          about us.

701
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,796
  I'm gonna stop here to be
 polite to you for a second.

702
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,599
 But this goes on for hours
         and hours.

703
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,601
     And it gets so weird
         and abstract.

704
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,069
    At the end, it's like,
            "Why?"

705
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:56,907
Well, because some things are,
   and some things are not.

706
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,709
            "Why?"

707
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:03,480
     Well, because things
    that are<i> not</i> can't<i> be.</i>

708
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,782
            "Why?"

709
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,450
     Because then nothing
         wouldn't be.

710
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,187
    You can't have fucking
        "nothing isn't,

711
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,689
         everything is."

712
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,123
            "Why?"

713
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,758
  'Cause if nothing wasn't,
     there'd be fucking

714
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:15,859
      all kinds of shit
        that we don't--

715
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,829
 like, giant ants with top hats,
         dancing around.

716
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,297
        There's no room
     for all that shit.

717
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,799
             "Why?"
          Oh, fuck you!

718
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,167
    Eat your french fries,
       you little shit.

719
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,034
         God damn it!

720
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,870
     Thank you very much,
          everybody.

721
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,005
         Good night.
         Thank you.
