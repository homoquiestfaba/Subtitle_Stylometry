1
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,493
Look over my right shoulder.

2
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,154
Good.

3
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:32,029
Look over my leFT shoulder.

4
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,830
Very good.

5
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,834
You know. Mr. Gromberg...

6
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,204
you're not going
to want to hear this...

7
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,209
but for a man of your age...

8
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:46,010
less than a year aFTer a stroke.
You are in remarkable shape.

9
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,914
Well. My damn ticker.

10
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:52,078
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom...
a mile a minute.

11
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:54,714
Well. Your cardiogram
showed no abnormalities.

12
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,485
Blood pressure... high?

13
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,618
Your blood pressure?
Better than mine.

14
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,063
How about my liver?

15
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,395
Your liver's
holding up perfectly.

16
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,024
- Kidneys?
- Fine.

17
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,729
- What about this?
- What?

18
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:10,294
What. This?

19
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,864
That's dry skin. Mr. Gromberg.
It's not cancer.

20
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,805
- Say. "Ah."
- Ah.

21
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:21,941
So. Are you still seeing
your speech therapist?

22
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:25,578
No. She talks worse than I do.

23
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:28,817
Well. I hate to tell you this.
Mr. Gromberg...

24
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,689
but it looks like you still
have a few good years leFT.

25
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,320
"A few good years."

26
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:38,730
How do you know?
Do you talk to the man upstairs?

27
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,762
Hey. Gromberg.
What's that supposed to be?

28
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,172
- A sensei.
- A what?

29
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:49,370
A sensei. A karate sensei.

30
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:54,348
Yeah? Has your karate guy ever
seen a pair of these before?

31
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:58,943
Morning. Everyone. I'd like you
to join me in welcoming back...

32
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,546
your classmate Abigail Staley.

33
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:04,718
Most of you have known her
since kindergarten.

34
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:07,523
Is there something you'd care
to share with us. Gentlemen?

35
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,393
So. No matter
what you've heard...

36
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,797
over the last
couple of months...

37
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:15,769
I know that you will be
kind and considerate.

38
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,432
Isn't that right. Mr. Cooper?

39
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,599
Abby.

40
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,472
What the hell
are you looking at?

41
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,080
What the hell
are you looking at?

42
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,584
Gromberg. I am going to have...

43
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:31,881
the red-lined
martine agreement...

44
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:33,251
in time for the meeting.
Aren't I?

45
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:36,314
I am working on it
as we speak. Barney.

46
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:39,088
- Just checking.
- Sure thing.

47
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,253
Asshole.

48
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,388
- Alex?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:43,829
I have your wife on line two.

50
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,799
What time are the martine
people getting here?

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,962
- Any minute.
- Shit.

52
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,130
Yeah. Hiya. Bec.

53
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:52,571
Hi. I have five minutes
between patients.

54
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,506
I just needed
a moment of sanity.

55
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,010
So you're calling me?

56
00:04:58,314 --> 00:04:59,508
Am I on speaker phone?

57
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:02,106
I'm sorry. Honey. I'm up to
my ass with this martine thing.

58
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:05,347
Oh. OK. Don't forget
your parents are coming at 6:30.

59
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,184
Don't you dare be late.

60
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,588
And they're bringing
Uncle Stephen.

61
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:12,786
Oh. My God.
Better get out the body bags.

62
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,260
I'll pick up some matzo
on my way home...

63
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,558
aFTer the soup kitchen.

64
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,327
- OK. Bye.
- Bye. love.

65
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,925
Got a minute?

66
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:22,595
Oh. Deb. Deb. Deb. Please.

67
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,605
This is Rosario.
She's the sister-in-law...

68
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:27,107
to maria Elena.
Who cleans my house.

69
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:28,905
It's very nice to meet you.
Rosario.

70
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:31,912
- Lf you'll excuse me...
- Rosario has a problem.

71
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,948
She lives with her four sons...

72
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,247
her sister. Her sister's
husband. And their three kids.

73
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,344
And they haven't had
hot water for three months.

74
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,787
And they just made it through
the winter without heat.

75
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,289
Almost made it through.

76
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:48,524
Her father just passed away
from pneumonia.

77
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,656
Sorry.
I'm sorry about your dad...

78
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,826
but I don't know
what you want me to do.

79
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,531
I haven't done public advocacy
stuff in years.

80
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,837
Well. It's what
you should be doing.

81
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,045
All right. Rosario. OK.

82
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,173
I'll take a look at this.
I'll see what I can do. OK?

83
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,739
Gracias. Senor. Muchas gracias.

84
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,751
No problema.

85
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,681
Is someone coming to pick you
up later. Mrs. Gromberg?

86
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,726
Yes. My grandson.

87
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:20,990
Oh. Well. You let us know
if you need a taxi. OK?

88
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:22,394
You shouldn't be walking.

89
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,022
I have two grandsons.

90
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,832
Eli's the youngest. He's eleven.
He's Pappy's favorite.

91
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:31,134
And Asher's the one
who's picking me up.

92
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:34,334
I didn't want him to bother.
But my son insisted.

93
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,902
Asher's very laid out.

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,141
Laid back.

95
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:42,775
Oh. Back.

96
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:45,217
Right. Laid back.

97
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:48,745
Are you among the living today.
Mr. Gromberg?

98
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,384
Yeah. I'm here. Man. Ask away.
What do you want to know?

99
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,950
I asked you
if you had any thoughts...

100
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,189
on the progress
of mr. Stein's one-act play...

101
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,698
"Three Kikes and a Heeb."

102
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,961
Yeah. I mean.
To tell you the truth. Sir...

103
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:03,129
I was completely blown away
by this piece of material here.

104
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,765
I mean. Stein. Man.
That part where you have...

105
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,674
you know. The antagonist
antagonizing the protagonist?

106
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,302
- I mean. That was...
- What is he talking about?

107
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,438
- That was rock-solid. Man.
- This is ridiculous.

108
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:15,449
How many pages of mr. Stein's
hard work did you actually read?

109
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:16,643
That's a good question.

110
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:20,484
I believe it was
all but the last nineteen. Sir.

111
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,116
- Out of twenty?
- Mr. Edwards.

112
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,286
Not bad. Yes. Ms. Maloney.

113
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:29,762
I am amazed at you people.

114
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,096
Did no one but I find
the sickening display...

115
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,296
of anti-Semitism dripping from
every page incredibly offensive?

116
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,601
- I did. I certainly did.
- Would you... thank you.

117
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,369
I am sorry. But when
you have a Jewish character...

118
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,410
playing charades.
And you devote ten pages...

119
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,447
to his feeble attempt at acting
out the word "Holocaust"...

120
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,379
and make no condemnation
of the Nazis...

121
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,541
I'm sorry?

122
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:50,175
I mean. Do you have
no sense of decency?

123
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:53,153
- Have you no sense of humor?
- Humor?

124
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,020
How can I be anti-Semitic?
I was bar mitzvahed.

125
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,526
Oh. I'm sorry about that. Guys.

126
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,188
It's my grandma.
I gotta pick her up.

127
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,255
Could you possibly be
any more unappealing?

128
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,932
You are like a zoo monkey
smeared in his own feces.

129
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:14,237
Someone should follow you
around with a pooper scooper.

130
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,970
Pooper scooper. Huh?

131
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:22,547
OK. Mr. Gromberg. Show a little
class on your way out. Please.

132
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:23,778
Yes. Sir.

133
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:28,683
- Watch out. Man.
- Yo. Dude!

134
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,349
OK. My beautiful ladies...

135
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:33,519
today. We are running
a little bit of a special.

136
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,460
Two bags for ninety.

137
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,967
Nicky said he got two
for one twenty.

138
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,127
Well. For Nicky.
Two bags are one twenty.

139
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:44,866
But for Katie and Erica.
Two bags are ninety.

140
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,209
Do you take checks?

141
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,111
Cash only. Sweetie.

142
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,738
I don't have any cash.

143
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,578
Oh. Shit.
I gotta get outta here.

144
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,881
But I have to go to an ATm.

145
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,387
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you guys next time.

146
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,719
You see. Dr. Gromberg...

147
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:08,058
in the window
was this display of socks.

148
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,361
Beautiful. Fun socks.

149
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,197
Every color imaginable.

150
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,531
Cashmere.

151
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:17,435
Next thing I know...

152
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,031
the saleswoman is wrapping up
ten pairs for me.

153
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:21,666
Forty bucks a pair.

154
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,734
That's a lot of money for socks.

155
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,906
Does Noah
buy you special giFTs?

156
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,973
I can't remember
the last time...

157
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,519
he came home
with anything for me.

158
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:37,587
- Son of a bitch.
- Sir?

159
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,354
No. No. Not you.

160
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,761
My ex-partner... Kipling.

161
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,264
He died.

162
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,161
At last!

163
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:57,207
We're here. Sir.

164
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:04,251
Stephen.
Your brother is here.

165
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:09,987
Ahoy. Captain.
Are you ready to go?

166
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,151
Where are we going?

167
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:15,754
Pesach. We're going to a Seder.

168
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,896
- Passover?
- Yes.

169
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:25,434
Not yet. Not yet.

170
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,370
Gefilte fish?

171
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,208
Mama makes good gefilte fish.

172
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,681
Gefilte fish. Yes...

173
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,946
but not mama's.

174
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,612
Zabar's.

175
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,818
My daughter-in-law can't cook.

176
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,588
Ew! Ew! What are they doing?
That's gross.

177
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:49,893
You don't know what that is?
That's sixty-nine.

178
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:53,992
Sixty-nine's all right.
But it's nothing like oral sex.

179
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:59,166
Get away! Get off. Shea!

180
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,710
Anybody wet their pampers
today?

181
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,044
No. You?

182
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:11,108
Hey. You. You're in little
Abby Staley's class. Right?

183
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,287
Well. You tell little Abby...

184
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:16,119
that she never finished
what she started.

185
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:18,751
Tell her I've waited too long.
And my balls are gonna burst.

186
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,266
Whoa! Miss Congeniality!

187
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,360
Jesus. Gromberg.
Are you following me?

188
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,770
Following you?
Why would I be following you?

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,173
You just called me a zoo monkey
smeared in my own feces...

190
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:37,575
which I actually thought
was kind of funny.

191
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,614
But. No. I'm actually
just on my way uptown...

192
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:40,909
to go pick up my grandmother.

193
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:43,007
Your grandmother? Oh. Please.
That is such bullshit.

194
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,986
No. I am. I am. Sometimes
I pick her up from dialysis.

195
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:49,649
Oh. You are so following me.
And I wish you would stop it.

196
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:52,785
You know what. Peg?
You excite me.

197
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:55,455
You are so moronic it is unreal.

198
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,088
Oh. Screw me.

199
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,360
- I don't think so.
- No. No. I gotta go.

200
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:07,369
But before I do.
Let me get your digits.

201
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:08,534
Excuse me?

202
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,237
Your phone number.
I wanna give you a buzz.

203
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,109
You don't get the message.
Do you?

204
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,011
What do I have to do.
Barf on your Nikes?

205
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,344
Just give me your number...

206
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,282
and I'll quit hasslin' you.
All right?

207
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,752
- It's on the class roster.
- Oh. Yeah?

208
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,379
Under "unavailable."

209
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,390
At least give me some skin.

210
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:28,456
Later.

211
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,035
Excuse me.
Is mrs. Gromberg here?

212
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,870
You just missed her. I put her
in a taxi ten minutes ago.

213
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:44,810
Damn! Was she OK at least?

214
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,280
Listen. She's old.
It takes a lot out of her.

215
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,715
If you can't be here on time...

216
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:52,083
get somebody else
who can pick her up.

217
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:58,317
What kind of shit-ass portion
is this? Now serve it up!

218
00:12:58,393 --> 00:12:59,655
Everything OK here. Suzie?

219
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,060
I explained to him
that we don't give seconds...

220
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,597
until everyone's had a turn.

221
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,394
She ain't gave me
but a few carrots.

222
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,162
A man needs his vitamin E.

223
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,795
It's vitamin A. But you're
right. It keeps the eyes sharp.

224
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,032
But we can't serve seconds till
everybody gets their firsts.

225
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:14,405
But I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do...

226
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,603
why don't you sit down
and enjoy your meal?

227
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,737
And I'm gonna make a plate here.

228
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,339
And if you're still hungry.
You come on back here...

229
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,816
and this plate will be
sittin' waitin' for you...

230
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,319
right... right here.

231
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,652
Aren't you
the little peacemaker today?

232
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,969
- They should give you an award.
- They already have...

233
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,336
most dishes washed.
Lake Kiamasha. 1966.

234
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,708
Yeah. But not
for how many you do.

235
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,215
It's for how damn good you look
when you do them.

236
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:56,978
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What?

237
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:59,919
Oh. Don't tell me
you haven't felt it.

238
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,114
Felt what?

239
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,625
The heat between us
for weeks now.

240
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,251
- Suzie...
- All the steam...

241
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:07,761
the chafing dishes.

242
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:09,490
- Suzie. Suzie.
- What?

243
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:12,260
Oh. I'm so wet.

244
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,892
Come on.
You know I'm married. Suzie.

245
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:16,028
Yeah. I do. And so am I.

246
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:17,935
You are such a troublemaker.

247
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:20,474
Oh. But you see.
I'm kinda worth it. So...

248
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,311
Oh. Shit. Oh. Shit.

249
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,209
I can't do this.

250
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,482
Oh. You see.
I have evidence to the contrary.

251
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:03,411
You said
if I was still hungry...

252
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:24,597
Suzie...

253
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:52,257
Oh. Thank you. No.
It's a little early for me.

254
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,167
- Salud.
- Salud.

255
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,397
OK. What can I do to help?

256
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,773
The dishes. Don't break any.

257
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:40,039
You're such the happy helper
this evening. Aren't you?

258
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,015
It's called survival. Honey.

259
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:46,511
Mom?

260
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,782
Yeah. Honey?

261
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:28,052
What a farkakte neighborhood!

262
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:31,825
- Hello!
- Hi!

263
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,358
- Hi. Mom. How are you?
- Let me give you a kiss.

264
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,234
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

265
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,102
Hi. Uncle Stephen! How are you?

266
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,603
- He's not deaf.
- Hiya. Dad.

267
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:45,578
- How are you doing?
- He's not deaf.

268
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,138
He's just demented.

269
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:50,343
- Where are the boys?
- Eli!

270
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:52,943
- Where's Asher?
- He'll be here any minute.

271
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,545
Everybody move
into the living room.

272
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,613
- Can I get you a drink?
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.

273
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:57,988
You want the usual?

274
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,219
- Alex.
- Yeah.

275
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:02,752
This year. Please.
Some real wine.

276
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,095
- Mitchell.
- Aw. You don't like...

277
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,100
the kosher wine
we serve you. Dad?

278
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,796
You schlep me
all the way down here.

279
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,897
At least give me wine
that I can drink.

280
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:15,272
Well. That's a point
well taken. Dad.

281
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:17,311
Would you get me a tequila
while you're at it?

282
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:20,711
She's jumpin'! She's jumpin'!
She's...

283
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:22,272
Stephen.

284
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,875
Grandma. Grandpa!

285
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,079
Give me five.

286
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,084
Now. Eli. This is important.

287
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,287
First...

288
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:40,600
a quick kick in the shins
gets his attention.

289
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:44,604
Then. Using the palm. Whack!

290
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,902
Smack in the kisser.

291
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:50,001
Push his nose
right into his brain.

292
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,978
Mitchell.
What are you telling him?

293
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:54,207
Don't worry. Don't worry.

294
00:18:54,282 --> 00:18:59,879
Your finish... a knee
right in the family jewels.

295
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:03,185
Mitchell. Please refrain
from filling my son's head...

296
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,850
with your blood-and-guts
stories.

297
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:07,019
Every boy
should know these things.

298
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:09,825
Every boy
should not know these things.

299
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,331
- Yes. I should.
- Yeah!

300
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:16,504
Not yet. Not yet.

301
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,801
Was he always like this?

302
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,437
Oh. No. Dear.

303
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:29,847
No. Uncle Stephen
was a great navy man.

304
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,718
Very brave.
And very dashing in his uniform.

305
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:39,825
All right. Everybody.
Let's come to the table.

306
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,020
Where's Asher?

307
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:43,461
He's probably hanging out
on some street corner.

308
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:46,466
We'll go ahead and start.
He'll join us when he gets here.

309
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:49,560
- Manners of a caveman.
- Mama. You're there.

310
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:52,572
- Thank you. Mitchell.
- What? He should be here.

311
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,380
Not yet. Stephen!

312
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,383
Not yet.

313
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,215
"We thank you.
O Lord our God...

314
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:09,017
"king of the universe...

315
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,650
"who created
the fruit of the vine."

316
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,422
Amen.

317
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,863
Only 1927!

318
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,504
Give me a hard-boiled...

319
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,872
This is the bread
of our affliction...

320
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:32,242
and this one is the afikomen.

321
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:36,545
I will hide the afikomen...
and don't you cheat.

322
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,848
"Why is it on all other nights
during the year...

323
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,184
"we eat bread or matzo...

324
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:42,723
"but on this night
we eat only matzo?"

325
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,281
- Excuse me.
- Now what?

326
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,884
I'm sorry. Son.

327
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,588
Alex. You have
to take this now?

328
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:49,925
This may be an emergency.

329
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,829
Hey. My grandson
is reading the four questions!

330
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,992
- Eli. Please. I'm sorry.
- No. It's OK.

331
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:57,560
No. No. No.
Go ahead. Start again.

332
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,403
Ignores his duties
at the firm for years.

333
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:03,239
- Now he has to work.
- Mitchell. Not now.

334
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,869
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

335
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,039
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

336
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:10,573
You're talkin' to me about duty?
Dad. I know all about duty.

337
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,143
Duty to my family
as well as my work.

338
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:16,156
- What about me?
- Alex. Don't start this.

339
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:20,058
I mean. Where were you. Huh?
I mean. Where were you?

340
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,096
At least I've made an effort
to be here.

341
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:27,260
Eli. Read it like you mean it.

342
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:30,429
- "Why is this night..."
- Hey. Everybody.

343
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:34,771
Well. At least you got here
before Elijah did.

344
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:37,970
- Uncle Stephen. Pappy. Mom.
- Hello. Darling.

345
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,377
Hey. Little man.

346
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,472
- Good to see you. Son.
- Good to see you. Too. Dad.

347
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,710
- Glad you could make it.
- Yeah. Me. Too.

348
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:51,357
You want to find out if anybody
else would like the last piece?

349
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:55,088
Would anybody else like
this last piece of brisket?

350
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:56,255
No. Thanks.

351
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:57,491
At least somebody else here
likes the wine.

352
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,523
You're not doing too bad
yourself.

353
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:03,934
Mom. Mean brisket.

354
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,097
It's my best work yet.
Isn't it?

355
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:06,299
It's wonderful.

356
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:13,778
What is it?
Tell me. Stephen. Tell me.

357
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:14,940
- Is he all right?
- He's all right.

358
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,678
He's having a good time.

359
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:18,844
Abby Staley came back today.

360
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,581
- Who?
- What. Honey?

361
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,850
Abby Staley...
she came back to class today.

362
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,516
- Who's she?
- She did?

363
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,150
- Who did?
- This little girl in his class.

364
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:28,821
She ran away with an older boy.
She's twelve years old.

365
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:31,797
This happens
at artsy-fartsy school?

366
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,767
- Kids run away?
- Did you talk to her?

367
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:37,430
No. I don't even like her.

368
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:39,598
She thinks she's cooler than
everybody else in the class.

369
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,301
If she wants to run away.
It's OK with me.

370
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:43,037
You should be a little more
compassionate than that.

371
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,477
She's obviously going through
a very hard time right now.

372
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:47,207
Whatever.

373
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,340
Do you ever think about
running away?

374
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,714
Sometimes.

375
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:55,051
I would run away. Too.
From such a farkakte school.

376
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,320
- That's helpful. Mitchell.
- Come on. Dad. That's enough.

377
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:00,258
Enough!

378
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:01,556
He said it.

379
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:04,530
Good for you.

380
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,693
You want to tell us
why you didn't pick up...

381
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,031
your grandmother
from dialysis today?

382
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:11,094
Alex. You promised me
you wouldn't say anything.

383
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:13,834
- It's no big deal.
- I think it's a big deal.

384
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:16,433
Asher. We ask so little of you.
We counted on you...

385
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,603
Do you know how serious it is?

386
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:19,669
Do you have any idea
what dialysis is?

387
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:21,180
Yeah. Dad.
I do. As a matter of fact.

388
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:23,979
Kidney dialysis
is the process...

389
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:27,714
of filtering the accumulated
waste products of metabolism...

390
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:28,881
from the blood of a patient...

391
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:30,423
whose kidneys
aren't functioning properly.

392
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:31,753
You guys hear that?

393
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:33,760
If this is too much
responsibility for you...

394
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:35,386
I don't want you
fighting over me.

395
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,021
When I was his age...

396
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,123
I supported a wife. A kid...

397
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,633
Oh. That's not true. Dad!

398
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:43,192
When you were his age.
I wasn't even born yet.

399
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,468
All of you. Let it pass!
Let it be!

400
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,169
As a matter of fact. I had
a very interesting experience...

401
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:50,505
aFTer I leFT dialysis.

402
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:54,139
- What happened?
- I got in the cab...

403
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,145
and then I went
to my mother's old building.

404
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,950
- Why did you do that?
- Didn't you go home?

405
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,992
I'm not sure. I just...

406
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,324
I just found myself there.

407
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:11,488
I think it's a sign.

408
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,865
Honey. What the hell
are you talking about?

409
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:17,097
A sign? What sign?

410
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:20,304
- Look. Granny. I'm sorry.
- Oh. That's all right. Honey.

411
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,143
I'm gonna go drain my dragon.

412
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,211
- Drain his what?
- His dragon. Dear.

413
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:32,081
You can't always run away
from consequences. Asher.

414
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:33,677
Sooner or later.
You're going to have to...

415
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,783
Oh. Jesus.

416
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:39,349
Silent. But violent.

417
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,200
You win! You win! I surrender.

418
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,794
OK. We'll do it your way.

419
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,224
What?

420
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:24,267
I didn't say
you can come in here.

421
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,703
I didn't ask. Man.

422
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,577
So. What's your secret. Bro?

423
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:43,453
All this ying-yang stuff
bring the pootie tang?

424
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:44,923
What's that mean?

425
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:49,161
You got yourself a lady friend
these days?

426
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,424
None of your business.

427
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:52,762
Hmm. You pokin' her?

428
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,095
I'm eleven.

429
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,864
Who cares. Man?
Tell me you've at least...

430
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,838
slapped the old Gromberg
lip-lock on her.

431
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:01,374
Not yet. But I'm gonna.

432
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:03,603
That's all right. Man.
Come here.

433
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:07,739
How many girls
have you macked so far?

434
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,749
- None.
- None?

435
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:12,917
None?

436
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,282
Now. What's this
supposed to be?

437
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,917
It's whatever you think it is.

438
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:20,893
What does it look like to you?

439
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,520
Like a piece of shit.

440
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:25,566
Mitchell! He's just being
provocative. You know him.

441
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:27,430
Now he's an art critic.

442
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:32,803
Hello! What was this place.
A paint factory?

443
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:34,101
Ink factory. Dad.

444
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,769
Strange place
to raise kids. Huh?

445
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:40,245
Four thousand square feet.
Supportive parents.

446
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:41,804
I mean. How bad can it be. Dad?

447
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:45,841
And that's why Asher
is a social misfit.

448
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,888
- Mitchell!
- That's it.

449
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:50,480
Boys. Time for the afikomen!

450
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:56,554
Forty-nine years...
I don't know how you do it.

451
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:59,293
That's not fair. He's been
through a lot this past year.

452
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,664
This year isn't any different
than any other year.

453
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,226
He's still a ballbuster.
Except this year...

454
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:06,068
it's more difficult for him
to enunciate his insults.

455
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,835
When are you gonna
learn to ignore...

456
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:09,899
the things
you don't like about him...

457
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,569
and embrace the things you do?

458
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:12,806
He loves you.

459
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,781
Well. He sure has
a funny way of showing it.

460
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,614
Alex. He's not gonna be
around forever.

461
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:22,486
Found it!
Wow. A thousand dollars.

462
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:23,682
What?

463
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,519
One for me and one for Asher.

464
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:29,290
Wow!
Aren't you the lucky boy?

465
00:27:29,363 --> 00:27:33,299
Thank Granny and Pappy for
being so unbelievably generous.

466
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,699
- Thanks. Granny.
- You're welcome. Honey.

467
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:43,375
Hey. My boy. My boy.

468
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:54,654
I wish you and Alex would stop.

469
00:27:54,722 --> 00:27:58,180
What? Jeez.

470
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,620
They're waltzing. Mitchell.

471
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:05,825
Look at that.

472
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,861
Isn't that glorious?

473
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:13,399
I can't remember the last time
we danced together.

474
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,804
Hey. We're gonna still see
the end of the game.

475
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:24,542
I thought this night
would never end.

476
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:26,176
- What?
- Uncle Stephen.

477
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:30,383
Oh. Jesus. "Enough! Eno..."

478
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:36,590
- Do you think Asher was stoned?
- No.

479
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,291
I don't know.
It's hard to tell. Isn't it?

480
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:39,730
He's always like that.

481
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,267
I don't like
what's happening with him.

482
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:44,600
- I feel like we're losing him.
- He's twenty-one. Honey.

483
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,697
I wish he would talk to us.

484
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:50,039
I wish both of them
would talk to us.

485
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,739
I mean. What's with this?

486
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,576
What's going on
in that little head of his?

487
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:55,774
It's not that complicated.

488
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,944
He's asking for a $10 raise
each week with his allowance.

489
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:01,453
An 11-year-old boy? You don't
think this is a bit absurd?

490
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,513
Absolutely.
It's a highball number.

491
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,081
That's not what I mean.

492
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,686
I mean our son presented us
with a spreadsheet.

493
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,458
It's not about finances. Alex.

494
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:12,999
It's about our son...
both of them...

495
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:16,696
feeling comfortable
talking to us.

496
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:18,898
We're comfortable.

497
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,773
- What do you mean?
- Talking to each other.

498
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:25,004
Well. Yeah.

499
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:27,445
- Compared to most couples.
- Yeah.

500
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,276
Yeah.

501
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:35,478
Good night. Sweetie.

502
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,271
Hey. Watch where you're going!

503
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:54,807
- On your right!
- On your leFT!

504
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:01,608
Oh. I'm so sorry!
Sir. Are you OK. Sir?

505
00:30:01,682 --> 00:30:03,946
- Are you all right. Sir?
- Would you like to sit down?

506
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:07,510
Would you like
a smack in the kisser?

507
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,079
- Get off of me.
- Sorry.

508
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,929
How was your walk.
Mr. Gromberg?

509
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,564
Mr. Gromberg?

510
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,452
- Hi.
- Hi.

511
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,589
I can't figure out
this damn e-mail.

512
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:53,530
It looks like Eli
sent me something...

513
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,694
but I can't figure out
how to reply.

514
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:57,703
Use a pen.

515
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:16,749
Mitchell?

516
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:21,420
I fell.

517
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,629
Are you all right?

518
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:37,769
Evelyn. Let me give you
some good advice...

519
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,279
never get old.

520
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:13,208
- Hiya. Becky. Sweetheart.
- Hi. Honey.

521
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,043
I know you want to wish Eli
good luck...

522
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:18,278
since you can't be here.
Here he is.

523
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:19,444
Hi. Dad.

524
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,681
Eli. You go get 'em. All right?

525
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,124
Thanks. Dad. Here's mom.

526
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:29,929
I got all your roses. Darling.
It was very extravagant.

527
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:32,022
Happy anniversary. Sweetheart.

528
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,727
Twenty-two years. Huh?
Twenty-two.

529
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:36,963
Happy anniversary to you. Too.

530
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,732
I'll see you later. Bye.

531
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:41,502
OK. See you tonight.

532
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:43,406
I love you.

533
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:45,138
Deb...

534
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:47,305
"a little rent strike"?

535
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:52,475
This is not
a little rent strike.

536
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,418
This is a goddamn uprising.

537
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:57,116
You can handle it.
Just be yourself.

538
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:59,751
Myself? Oh. You're talking
about that knee-jerk liberal...

539
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,920
who hasn't been above
86th Street in years.

540
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:05,090
- Senor Gromberg.
- I gotta go. Deb. Thank you.

541
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:08,259
So. Together. We will succeed...

542
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:14,604
not only in getting your heat
and hot water back on...

543
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:40,131
- What did you say to them?
- I don't know.

544
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,260
I just asked them how they felt
about hot showers.

545
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:44,861
I guess they like them.

546
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,666
Yay. Eli!

547
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,225
What you got. Man?
What you got. Drew?

548
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:18,203
What you got. Dawg?
What you got. Dawg?

549
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,507
All right. You ready for this.
Man? You ready for this?

550
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,546
Come on. Admit it. Dawg.
You checking out my ass?

551
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:28,604
You like this?
Watch this. Watch this.

552
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:46,557
Sub! Sub!

553
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,456
Oh. You are such a sad boy.

554
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,120
Come here.

555
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,727
Come here.

556
00:35:20,934 --> 00:35:22,458
Excuse me.

557
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:24,094
I tell you. Man.

558
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:27,299
Punk ass hit me
with the body. Sheesh.

559
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:29,308
Looked like a foul to me.

560
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,872
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in class?

561
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:37,383
Didn't feel like going
to class today. I guess.

562
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,715
What. I can't cut class?
What about you?

563
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:42,687
This is your fiFTh time
this semester.

564
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:44,246
At least someone's counting.

565
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:47,384
I couldn't care less
how many classes you cut.

566
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:49,486
You're the one
wasting the tuition. Not me.

567
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:52,623
Yeah. Well. looks like
I'm going to have to cough up...

568
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,463
another year's worth.

569
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,026
I just got a letter
from the registrar...

570
00:35:57,104 --> 00:36:00,972
and they want me to
stick around for another year.

571
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:05,273
You know. My grades
are the pits. So whatever.

572
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:10,080
I'm sorry. Asher.

573
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,015
Yeah. It's all good.

574
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:13,780
What'd you expect?

575
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:27,359
- Shit. I'm late. I got to go.
- All right.

576
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,404
Give me your hand.

577
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:34,065
- What?
- Your hand. Fool.

578
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:36,234
OK.

579
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,470
What's this?

580
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:43,207
- My digits.
- OK.

581
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:45,774
- Call me.
- I will.

582
00:36:45,852 --> 00:36:47,080
Maybe.

583
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,687
This is so high school.

584
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,363
Oh. Are you going to pretend
nothing ever happened?

585
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:00,832
Nothing did. You know. Happen.

586
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,301
What is that.
The Bill Clinton defense?

587
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:07,067
Because I could've sworn
something happened. You know?

588
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:16,382
Why don't you just
finish me off?

589
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,078
Suzie. Suzie.
I am so flattered. OK?

590
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:20,585
- Oh. Good.
- But we got to let this go.

591
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:25,284
Because. The truth is.
Guilt is stronger than lust.

592
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:35,901
I was so proud of you.
You did so good.

593
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:37,197
Let's put this right here...

594
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:40,069
so Dad can't miss it
when he comes in. OK?

595
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,803
Wonderful. I'm starving.

596
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:49,442
Eli. Dad and I talked about
your allowance request.

597
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,484
We have no problem
giving you more money.

598
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,815
We know you'll spend it wisely.

599
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:56,855
We just wish
that you'd let us know...

600
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:59,892
a little bit more
of what you're thinking...

601
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,121
in words.

602
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:05,255
- You know what I mean?
- Whatever.

603
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:08,761
I just want you to know...

604
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,598
that you can talk to us
about anything...

605
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:13,196
anything at all.
Whatever's on your mind.

606
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:17,039
There's nothing you can say
that will upset us.

607
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,771
Understood?

608
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:27,285
Do you and Dad ever sixty-nine?

609
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:33,092
Will it be the usual.
Mr. Gromberg?

610
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,593
- The usual.
- All right.

611
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,960
- And for you. Mrs. Gromberg?
- She'll have the usual.

612
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,891
What's good tonight. Bruno?

613
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,800
Well. Tonight...
tonight. We have the osso buco.

614
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,862
Very nice. Served
with potatoes and broccoli.

615
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,899
We have a veal chop cooked in
a marsala wine... very lovely.

616
00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:52,842
I'll just have the usual
as well.

617
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,780
Oh. Good decision.

618
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,376
At least I entertain the idea
of trying something new...

619
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:02,547
a concept
that you've never grasped.

620
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:09,017
Let's do presents.

621
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,691
Oh. Maybe there's a job offer
for our oldest son in here.

622
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:14,825
Oh. Boy. Huh?
I could only hope.

623
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:16,528
Wait a minute. Ladies first.

624
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:18,901
I may be a selfish.
Money-grubbing lawyer...

625
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:21,236
but I am still a gentleman.

626
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:23,139
God knows
where you learned that from.

627
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,043
- My mother. Of course.
- Of course.

628
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:38,114
It's on order. It's got
automatic button-holing...

629
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:40,853
auto-embroidery. Auto-eroticism.

630
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,657
This little puppy
can do everything.

631
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,166
It's called a Pfaff.

632
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,301
A sewing machine.

633
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,302
I...

634
00:39:58,678 --> 00:39:59,838
Thank you.

635
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,381
All right. Now. Wait.
Is this a schmucky thing to do?

636
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:04,644
- No. No. No. No.
- You always talked about...

637
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:07,551
wanting to design
your own clothes. Didn't you?

638
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:11,590
- I did. Didn't I?
- Yeah.

639
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:13,852
Thank you. Honey.

640
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,530
Gosh. I don't know
when I'll find the time...

641
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,830
but. You know. I will.
I'll make the time.

642
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:27,132
Open yours.

643
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:30,472
Ooh. I think I may be
the winner this year.

644
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:34,605
This is feeling awfully light...
awfully light.

645
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:42,785
Cashmere. Ooh. Now.
What did I do to deserve this?

646
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:45,154
Oh. Well. I have no idea.

647
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:47,659
Look under the socks.

648
00:40:57,537 --> 00:41:01,496
- Florence?
- I thought that we both...

649
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:05,636
could use a little Florence.

650
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:07,646
A second honeymoon.

651
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:11,947
Honey. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

652
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:13,417
Shit.

653
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,751
- Barney.
- Go ahead. Go take it.

654
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,813
Nah. The hell with him.

655
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,690
I've taken up a new case.

656
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:23,956
The martine account
wasn't enough for you?

657
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,726
A pro bono.

658
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,166
I'm working on
a rent strike in Harlem.

659
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,794
Oh. Honey.

660
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:34,466
That's the best thing
I've heard you say in months.

661
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:46,851
Asher.

662
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,879
Asher? Asher!

663
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:52,652
Oh. Oh. What's up?
Hey. Yo. Let her in. Man.

664
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:07,806
Hey. Come on.

665
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:17,983
- By the way...
- What's that?

666
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:20,417
- It's Katie.
- I know that. Sweetie.

667
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:24,321
I'm just reminding you...
for the morning.

668
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:38,702
Can I ask you something?

669
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:41,332
Anything you want. Katie.

670
00:42:43,343 --> 00:42:45,334
Whose number is that?

671
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,181
That?
That number right there...

672
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,947
is a number for the burn unit
at the mount Sinai Hospital.

673
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,456
You know. In case it gets
a little bit too steamy tonight.

674
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:09,965
What the hell's
going on here. Alex?

675
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:13,267
Prostitution. Drugs.
Rock and roll.

676
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,103
We just got a call from Waxman
over at martine.

677
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,609
Yeah?
How's his lisp these days?

678
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,739
- Have you gone wacko?
- Could you excuse us. Please?

679
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:24,443
Not that I'm aware of. No.

680
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:26,109
You just took opposing counsel
against a client of ours.

681
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,120
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

682
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,656
Do the words "due diligence"
ring a bell?

683
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:32,589
That project
that you just flew into...

684
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:36,356
with your goddamn pro bono cape
flapping all over the place...

685
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:39,057
happens to be owned and run
by martine.

686
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:42,397
They're threatening
to switch counsel.

687
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:45,768
That's a $9 million account
for this firm... 9 million.

688
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,500
They are breaking the law.
Barney.

689
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:50,270
Morning. Barney.

690
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:53,176
- What's this?
- They're called pupusas.

691
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:55,612
They're from Rosario.

692
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:58,412
Must I remind you
that our currency...

693
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:02,581
does not come
in the form of tortillas?

694
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:03,782
Pupusas.

695
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:09,418
You have been taken off
the martine account.

696
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:13,557
Given the facts. That probably
makes the best sense.

697
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:15,328
Might as well
take me off everything.

698
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,734
- What was that?
- Nothing.

699
00:44:17,804 --> 00:44:20,773
Look. Alex. Just because
you thumbed your nose...

700
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,102
at becoming a partner
doesn't mean...

701
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,700
you don't have obligations
to this firm.

702
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,440
This is too big a screw-up
to ignore...

703
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:31,314
even for the founding
partner's son. Yeah.

704
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:47,325
Oh. Shit. Dad.

705
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:05,150
Alex. It's Asher
returning your call.

706
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:07,584
Hey. Ash. Where'd I catch you?

707
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:09,451
I'm in the library.

708
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:12,923
Oh. What'd they do.
Roll a couple of kegs in there?

709
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:15,483
No. Dad.
I'm just doing a little writing.

710
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:16,893
Oh. That's good. That's good.

711
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:18,988
You know. I'd love to read
something you write...

712
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:21,465
whenever it feels OK.

713
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:24,196
That's fantastic. Dad.
I appreciate that.

714
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,000
How's that job hunt coming?

715
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:28,301
Listen. Dad.
I'm late for class...

716
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:33,641
Ash. Ash. That's not
the reason I called you.

717
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:35,476
I wanted to know if you wanted
to go to the game tonight.

718
00:45:35,548 --> 00:45:37,243
I got a couple of tickets.
You know?

719
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,784
Thought we'd have
a couple beers.

720
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:41,753
I can't. OK?

721
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:44,915
Ash. I'm talking about
the Yankees... box seats.

722
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,549
Listen. Dad.
I can't go. All right?

723
00:45:46,626 --> 00:45:48,821
I'm sorry.
I'll give you a call back.

724
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,422
What the hell?

725
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:26,056
Hey. I'm watching the Yankees.
Turn that thing off.

726
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:27,690
Let's go.

727
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,065
Up. We're going to dance.

728
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:33,936
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just about.

729
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:35,998
That's why you're going
to turn off that damn box...

730
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:37,474
and dance with me.

731
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:43,607
Off. Mitchell. That's not off.

732
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:48,547
And if I tried

733
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:52,079
I still couldn't hide
my love for you

734
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:54,922
I wanted to see that game. Too.

735
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:02,823
- Hold me.
- I am holding you.

736
00:47:02,902 --> 00:47:05,166
No. You fool.

737
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:09,334
Hold me like you love me.

738
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,536
There. That's better.

739
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:14,307
You went away

740
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,178
And my heart

741
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,277
Went with you

742
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:28,786
I speak your name

743
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:37,099
In my every prayer

744
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,970
If there's some other way

745
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,975
To prove that I love you

746
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:50,846
I'm sure I don't know how

747
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:54,978
You'll never know

748
00:47:55,054 --> 00:48:00,219
If you don't know now

749
00:48:26,986 --> 00:48:28,214
It's good. Isn't it?

750
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:32,255
So. How you doing. Buddy?
Everything OK?

751
00:48:32,325 --> 00:48:34,623
Yeah. The game's good.

752
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:37,060
I didn't mean just the game.

753
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,825
The food's good.

754
00:48:38,898 --> 00:48:40,866
No. I mean...

755
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:42,697
how's your life going. Eli?

756
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:45,431
Anything you want to ask
the old man?

757
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,802
Now's your chance.
And I've had...

758
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:49,501
a little bit of experience.
You know?

759
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,099
No. I'm good.

760
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:01,977
Charge!

761
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:36,414
I was thinking a nightgown...

762
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:39,652
in that mercerized
Egyptian cotton.

763
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,490
Oh. Lots of pictures appear.

764
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,427
Slinky. Yeah.

765
00:49:44,497 --> 00:49:47,830
It moved. This is great.
OK. Let me get a pen...

766
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,094
because
I don't want to forget this.

767
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:51,466
I want to write this down.
Wait a minute.

768
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:56,304
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.

769
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:59,308
Let's see.

770
00:50:11,057 --> 00:50:14,083
Comfortable...

771
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,821
talking!

772
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:26,565
Evelyn! Ninth inning.
Get in here.

773
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:37,742
Lousy game.

774
00:50:37,817 --> 00:50:41,344
They should've yanked that
pitcher in the third inning.

775
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:45,653
That was a big mistake...
a big mistake.

776
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:50,552
Your bath is ready!

777
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,929
And I'm ready. Too.

778
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:03,374
Hey. Hey. You can't take a bath
in your clothes.

779
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:04,808
Get up.

780
00:51:05,978 --> 00:51:07,946
Jeez.

781
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:11,307
Get up. Woman.

782
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:18,082
Oh. No. No. No.

783
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:20,148
Don't you dare do that.

784
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:23,024
Get up. Woman.

785
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:25,826
Goddamn. Evelyn. Get up!

786
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,836
Get up.

787
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:43,847
Get up. Evelyn. Get up. Get up.

788
00:52:48,453 --> 00:52:50,580
Well. We were wondering
what happened to you.

789
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:53,180
I thought you'd give public
transportation a break...

790
00:52:53,258 --> 00:52:54,885
come out with your family today.

791
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,554
I always take the train.

792
00:52:57,629 --> 00:53:00,496
I know you like the train. Dad.
Somebody would've picked you up.

793
00:53:00,565 --> 00:53:03,125
Or I would've come
and picked you up.

794
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:05,431
Where's Uncle Stephen?

795
00:53:05,504 --> 00:53:07,699
He's in bad shape.

796
00:53:07,772 --> 00:53:10,240
The doctor
wouldn't let him come.

797
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:16,975
Hey. What are all these cars
doing on my place?

798
00:53:17,048 --> 00:53:21,951
They're friends of mom's.
Come to pay their last respects.

799
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:28,255
When I think of my mother...

800
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:33,890
I think of her posture...

801
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:36,832
the way that she carried
herself through life.

802
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:39,496
She was upright...

803
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:42,199
with dignity. Always.

804
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:46,109
And those laser eyes
of hers...

805
00:53:46,178 --> 00:53:49,079
seeing right through you.

806
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:51,581
One look from her...

807
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,551
and she knew what the truth was.
Whatever the situation was.

808
00:53:58,023 --> 00:54:00,992
When I think of my mother...

809
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:03,550
I think of the word "grace."

810
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:08,930
That was a word
that was invented for her.

811
00:54:10,535 --> 00:54:13,732
She set the standard...

812
00:54:13,805 --> 00:54:15,830
in loyalty...

813
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:17,966
family pride...

814
00:54:18,043 --> 00:54:19,533
and love.

815
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:23,171
And she taught me well...

816
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:29,315
in what to look for
when choosing a wife.

817
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:34,449
So. Mom. I thank you.

818
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:15,465
Hey. What the hell
are you doing?

819
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:16,864
I got to pick up
some stuff in town.

820
00:55:16,935 --> 00:55:18,300
I thought I'd take it
for a ride.

821
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,565
What's the matter
with your kraut car?

822
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,735
- It's Japanese. Dad.
- Still the enemy.

823
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:27,141
We're not at war anymore.
Remember?

824
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:29,442
They're not the enemy.
They may be yours.

825
00:55:29,514 --> 00:55:34,417
My brother lost his legs
because of some Nazi bastards.

826
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:37,387
I know that. All I want to do
is just take it for a spin.

827
00:55:37,455 --> 00:55:40,390
Nobody else drives
this Chevy but me.

828
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,517
Fine. Fine.

829
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:44,858
You just keep
your precious car.

830
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:46,920
You shouldn't be driving
a goddamn shopping cart...

831
00:55:46,998 --> 00:55:49,023
better yet a '55 Chevy.

832
00:55:55,607 --> 00:55:57,006
Are you all right. Mitchell?

833
00:55:57,075 --> 00:56:01,405
No.

834
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:07,013
Was everything
the way you wanted it?

835
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:08,882
The service?

836
00:56:08,953 --> 00:56:11,353
Not very religious.

837
00:56:11,423 --> 00:56:13,983
You're standing on one leg.

838
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:15,788
What?

839
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,728
An old prophet
was once asked...

840
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:23,256
"Can you tell me
the meaning of religion...

841
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:26,168
"standing on one leg?"

842
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:28,762
And what did he say?

843
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,274
Do unto others...

844
00:56:31,343 --> 00:56:35,507
as you would have them do
unto you.

845
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,673
That's my belief.

846
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:40,377
We must be nice to people.

847
00:56:40,452 --> 00:56:42,113
And are you?

848
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:44,178
God. No.

849
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,119
Did you get the bread?

850
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:48,454
Yeah.

851
00:56:50,995 --> 00:56:53,759
Do you believe
in doing unto others...

852
00:56:53,832 --> 00:56:57,029
as you would have them
do unto you?

853
00:56:57,102 --> 00:56:58,865
What?

854
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:01,633
Your father does.

855
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:06,075
My father believes you do
to others before they do to you.

856
00:57:06,144 --> 00:57:08,840
Sorry. Dad.
I couldn't resist that.

857
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:11,677
Isn't it time
you learned how. Alex...

858
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:15,277
at least occasionally.
To resist?

859
00:57:16,821 --> 00:57:18,220
What do you want to eat.
Mitchell?

860
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:19,449
Fish.

861
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:22,015
We have whitefish.
And we have lox.

862
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:24,527
Fresh fish.

863
00:57:24,596 --> 00:57:26,723
We don't have any fresh.

864
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:28,231
We have a lake.

865
00:57:29,334 --> 00:57:32,064
Well. Why don't
you and Alex...

866
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:35,265
take the boat out
and go catch a fish?

867
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,331
Now?

868
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:39,138
Rebecca. This is ridiculous.

869
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:43,939
I need a partner
to row the boat.

870
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:45,346
You and me both.

871
00:57:47,852 --> 00:57:49,547
Your father needs a partner.

872
00:57:49,621 --> 00:57:51,179
Asher!

873
00:57:51,256 --> 00:57:53,383
Ah. Jesus.

874
00:57:57,562 --> 00:58:00,429
Your father's asking
for your company.

875
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:02,363
Rebecca. What is the problem?

876
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:15,911
Fish don't like that.

877
00:58:24,122 --> 00:58:27,558
I got a call from Jim Lindsay
the other day. Dad.

878
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,923
What's he calling you about?

879
00:58:29,994 --> 00:58:32,019
He said he saw
a guy out here...

880
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:36,795
who was assessing the property
on your instructions.

881
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:40,201
So? Testing the market.

882
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:42,535
- Testing the market?
- Yeah.

883
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:44,973
Does that mean you're
trying to sell the house?

884
00:58:45,043 --> 00:58:46,135
Why do you care?

885
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:49,078
What do you mean?
I love this house.

886
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:50,705
It's got mom's memories
all over there.

887
00:58:50,782 --> 00:58:51,749
Why the hell would you
even think about...

888
00:58:51,816 --> 00:58:54,011
You never even
come up here anymore.

889
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:56,519
We used to come here
all the time. And we will again.

890
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:59,182
Why wouldn't you have
the decency to tell me?

891
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:00,519
Maybe Rebecca and I...

892
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:02,719
would like to take over
ownership of the property.

893
00:59:02,794 --> 00:59:04,421
I'm not asking you
to give it to me. Dad.

894
00:59:04,496 --> 00:59:06,828
God forbid.
We'd write you a check.

895
00:59:06,898 --> 00:59:11,995
Hey. Dad. Could you chill out?
You're scaring my bites.

896
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:16,006
Asher. Don't hold
the pole like that.

897
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:18,838
Dad. Please. Let's stop with
the "moby Dick" crap. All right?

898
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,775
Just leave Asher
out of this whole thing.

899
00:59:20,845 --> 00:59:21,812
Dad. I don't need your help.

900
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,347
I'm not gonna have you
bringing Asher...

901
00:59:23,414 --> 00:59:25,405
into what happened to me
when I was growing up. Dad.

902
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:28,384
- Is that so?
- That's so. Dad. Enough. OK?

903
00:59:28,453 --> 00:59:31,581
Your wife died.
I've lost my mother.

904
00:59:31,656 --> 00:59:35,353
That's enough. OK?
Just... enough.

905
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:38,259
OK. Everybody. Group hug.
Come on.

906
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:41,321
Don't be a smart ass. OK?
I wasn't talking to you.

907
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:44,197
Stop trying to make everybody
cry with you all the time.

908
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:46,100
I'm sick of that.

909
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,037
Some men cry inside.

910
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:50,540
That's what I'm saying. Pappy.

911
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:52,940
Not everybody's a soggy
cracker like you. Dad.

912
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:56,208
Holy shit! I got a fish. Man!

913
00:59:56,281 --> 00:59:57,612
Good going. He got it.

914
01:00:00,718 --> 01:00:02,117
Look at that thing!

915
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:05,347
It's a big one.

916
01:00:05,423 --> 01:00:07,357
I know. It's a big one.
Oh. Shit.

917
01:00:07,425 --> 01:00:10,087
- The net.
- Where's the net?

918
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,356
- Hurry up. Dad!
- Get it up!

919
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,729
- Use your hands!
- I got it!

920
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,667
I've got him.
I've got him. OK?

921
01:00:18,736 --> 01:00:20,795
OK. Here we go. All right.

922
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:24,808
What the hell you doing. Man?
Damn! Tell me you didn't just...

923
01:00:24,876 --> 01:00:26,434
Schmuck!

924
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:29,139
- What the hell?
- You had it in your hand!

925
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:33,445
I'm sorry. OK?

926
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:36,720
I'm sorry!

927
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:43,425
Let's see if we can get
another one. Schmuck.

928
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:54,999
Mean brisket. Mom.

929
01:00:55,073 --> 01:00:57,098
I had nothing to do with it.

930
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:59,769
What's Pappy doing?
Can you see him?

931
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:02,813
Watching TV.

932
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,247
How can you just sit there?

933
01:01:06,317 --> 01:01:08,080
Go get him.

934
01:01:19,931 --> 01:01:22,923
- Dad...
- Not hungry.

935
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:38,078
I'm sorry about the fish
and everything.

936
01:01:38,149 --> 01:01:42,108
If you change your mind.
We'd love you to join us.

937
01:01:49,961 --> 01:01:51,952
I finally get it
all the way into the boat...

938
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:55,989
and what does my father do?
He drops the slippery sucker.

939
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:59,503
Are you upset
about your grandmother?

940
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,267
- Asher?
- Yeah. I'm here.

941
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:05,809
You want to talk about it?

942
01:02:05,877 --> 01:02:09,040
No. Not particularly.

943
01:02:09,113 --> 01:02:11,877
I'm really sorry.

944
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:14,008
Yeah. I know.

945
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:18,146
So. What are you doing
aFTer graduation?

946
01:02:18,222 --> 01:02:20,486
Doing that Eurorail...

947
01:02:20,558 --> 01:02:22,219
"Get on the train
with Americans...

948
01:02:22,293 --> 01:02:23,783
"who look exactly
like you" thing?

949
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:26,022
I have a job.

950
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:28,224
Of course you do.

951
01:02:28,299 --> 01:02:30,358
I'm actually starting
at the end of July.

952
01:02:30,435 --> 01:02:32,733
I'm going to be
an editorial assistant.

953
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:35,034
What about you?

954
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:40,203
AFTer my fiFTh year?
I have no idea.

955
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:44,408
Can I ask you
a personal question?

956
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:49,351
I don't deal with death
very well. So...

957
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,186
Are you wearing any
exciting undergarments?

958
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:54,588
Christ. Asher.

959
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:58,117
Does death always
make you this horny?

960
01:02:58,196 --> 01:03:00,756
I don't know.
This is my first death.

961
01:03:00,832 --> 01:03:02,094
Oh. Pappy!

962
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,633
Hello?

963
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:05,669
Yeah. No. It's my grandfather.

964
01:03:05,737 --> 01:03:09,002
Look. I better get going. OK?

965
01:03:09,073 --> 01:03:10,734
- Peg?
- Yeah?

966
01:03:10,808 --> 01:03:13,868
I'm glad I called.

967
01:03:13,945 --> 01:03:16,106
Me. Too.

968
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,408
I'll talk to you later.

969
01:03:17,482 --> 01:03:21,543
- Who was that?
- Just a lady friend.

970
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:24,417
You schtupping her?

971
01:03:24,489 --> 01:03:26,787
No. Actually. Not yet.

972
01:03:26,858 --> 01:03:30,089
Why the hell not?

973
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:33,096
Let me give you
a quick pointer.

974
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:36,725
When you're ready
to close the deal...

975
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:41,204
get up. Put on your shoes
and leave.

976
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:43,206
What do you mean?

977
01:03:43,274 --> 01:03:45,003
Just what I said.

978
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:48,568
Put on your shoes
and walk through the door.

979
01:03:48,646 --> 01:03:51,137
That's your pointer?

980
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:54,013
Hey. Mark my words.

981
01:03:54,085 --> 01:03:57,714
She'll come back
when you least expect it.

982
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,485
I know he thinks
he can handle it alone...

983
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:03,220
but mom.
She did everything for him.

984
01:04:05,696 --> 01:04:08,995
What happens
if he has another stroke?

985
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:11,261
Breaks one of his hips?

986
01:04:11,335 --> 01:04:13,667
Becca. What is this? What?

987
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:19,243
Look what the tooth fairy
leFT for you.

988
01:04:23,247 --> 01:04:25,215
Oh. Jesus.

989
01:04:25,283 --> 01:04:29,720
- I tried to wait. I really did.
- Oh. My God. Oh. Jesus. No.

990
01:04:29,787 --> 01:04:32,119
I loved your mother very much.
And I know you did. Too...

991
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,953
but she of all people
would understand...

992
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:36,152
that I couldn't go through
the motions any longer.

993
01:04:36,227 --> 01:04:38,491
- Honey. I know this looks bad...
- Bad?

994
01:04:38,563 --> 01:04:40,554
But it is not what you think.

995
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:41,825
Oh. Bad!

996
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:44,925
I have been acting like a crazy
person for the last two days...

997
01:04:45,002 --> 01:04:47,095
carrying around
another woman's panties...

998
01:04:47,171 --> 01:04:49,162
wondering what the hell
to do with this!

999
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,707
This is nothing. It's nothing.

1000
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:53,869
Nothing?
Don't tell me it's nothing!

1001
01:04:53,945 --> 01:04:55,037
Bec! Bec! Bec!

1002
01:04:55,112 --> 01:04:56,841
This is definitely
something. Alex!

1003
01:04:56,914 --> 01:04:59,542
Whatever the hell it is.
It's something!

1004
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:02,245
And it's got lace all over it!

1005
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,083
Nothing happened.
I'm washing dishes...

1006
01:05:04,155 --> 01:05:05,850
in the soup kitchen.
This woman comes up...

1007
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:08,084
- I don't want the details!
- I'm telling the truth!

1008
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:10,923
How did her frigging panties
end up in your pocket?

1009
01:05:10,995 --> 01:05:15,796
I don't know.

1010
01:05:18,636 --> 01:05:21,332
All right.

1011
01:05:21,405 --> 01:05:25,603
All right. Let's say that...

1012
01:05:25,676 --> 01:05:29,442
nothing happened.
Just like you said.

1013
01:05:32,383 --> 01:05:35,147
Did you want
something to happen...

1014
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:38,484
with this woman. Alex?
Did you?

1015
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:53,100
That's all I needed to know.

1016
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:56,264
Rebecca. I can't do this
right now.

1017
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,003
I don't expect you to.
But it's out there now...

1018
01:06:00,077 --> 01:06:04,673
and we're gonna have
to deal with it.

1019
01:06:04,782 --> 01:06:07,080
You OK. Little man?

1020
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:10,314
It's so retarded.

1021
01:06:10,388 --> 01:06:13,846
It's OK. Don't worry. Man.

1022
01:06:13,925 --> 01:06:16,917
Mom and Dad'll kiss and make up
before tomorrow morning.

1023
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:18,689
As gross as that sounds.

1024
01:06:18,763 --> 01:06:22,255
It's not mom and Dad.
It's dancing.

1025
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,857
What?

1026
01:06:23,935 --> 01:06:25,994
Dancing.

1027
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,937
There's a school dance
on Wednesday.

1028
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:31,668
Yuck. It's stupid.

1029
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:34,040
I don't get why anyone
would want to do that.

1030
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:38,480
Isn't your lady friend
gonna be there?

1031
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:39,675
You remember.

1032
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,379
The one you wanted to slap
the ol' Gromberg lip lock on?

1033
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:44,921
Whatever.

1034
01:06:44,989 --> 01:06:48,481
Man. Sixth grade dance.

1035
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,550
The spring fling.

1036
01:06:50,628 --> 01:06:54,860
If anything's gonna go down.
That's where it's gonna happen.

1037
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:57,992
Trust me.
I got your back on that one.

1038
01:06:58,069 --> 01:07:00,333
Yeah. Whatever.

1039
01:07:05,843 --> 01:07:07,504
She has a nose ring.

1040
01:07:07,578 --> 01:07:10,672
The runaway?

1041
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:13,216
That's your girlfriend?

1042
01:07:13,317 --> 01:07:15,478
It's Abby. Thank you very much.

1043
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,817
No shit.

1044
01:07:17,888 --> 01:07:21,415
I'm impressed. Wow. Man.

1045
01:07:21,492 --> 01:07:25,292
What's wrong
with a nose ring anyways?

1046
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:28,932
It's in her nose.

1047
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:37,202
I think I miss her.

1048
01:07:37,274 --> 01:07:41,108
Who. That little punk chick?

1049
01:07:41,178 --> 01:07:45,114
No. Granny.

1050
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,450
Yeah.

1051
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:56,153
I miss her. Too. Eli.

1052
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,644
You'll never know

1053
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:55,276
Just how much

1054
01:08:55,352 --> 01:08:59,152
I miss you

1055
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:06,289
You'll never know

1056
01:09:06,363 --> 01:09:09,093
Just how much

1057
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:16,129
I care

1058
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:19,938
And if I try

1059
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:27,978
I still couldn't hide
my love for you

1060
01:09:28,052 --> 01:09:29,349
Alex!

1061
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,420
In the doghouse. Huh?

1062
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:36,426
Don't ask. Dad.

1063
01:09:36,494 --> 01:09:39,019
Let's go for a ride.

1064
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:41,030
What?

1065
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:42,827
You can drive.

1066
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,358
I had a thought.

1067
01:09:46,437 --> 01:09:51,704
What if you and Rebecca
took over the deed?

1068
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,072
Which deed?

1069
01:09:53,144 --> 01:09:56,477
"Which deed."
The deed to the house.

1070
01:09:58,516 --> 01:10:00,347
Just thought about that. Huh?

1071
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:02,510
Wonder what made you
think of that.

1072
01:10:02,586 --> 01:10:05,248
- Pull over.
- Lf you just hold onto it...

1073
01:10:05,322 --> 01:10:07,313
there's a gas station
up on route 9.

1074
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:10,883
I don't have to pee.
Please pull over.

1075
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:13,555
Right here.

1076
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:25,405
Dad? Dad?

1077
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:27,944
Dad. You OK?

1078
01:10:28,012 --> 01:10:31,641
I met your mother here.

1079
01:10:31,715 --> 01:10:33,410
I thought you met
in law school.

1080
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:37,113
No. I met her...

1081
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:41,386
right there.
Bake sale.

1082
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:45,827
I bought a piece
of poppy seed cake.

1083
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:51,801
Went in to get another
just to see her again.

1084
01:10:51,869 --> 01:10:55,066
I must have had six slices...

1085
01:10:55,139 --> 01:11:00,304
before I had the nerve
to ask her to go out.

1086
01:11:06,383 --> 01:11:10,843
Your mother
was the best thing...

1087
01:11:10,921 --> 01:11:15,915
that ever happened in my life.

1088
01:11:15,993 --> 01:11:20,430
I can hardly breathe
without her.

1089
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:25,496
You know. For thirty years...

1090
01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:30,734
every Friday
I took the express...

1091
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:33,368
from Grand Central.

1092
01:11:33,444 --> 01:11:35,742
I used to love that train ride.

1093
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:40,011
Spending some time
alone with my dad.

1094
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:45,112
Your mother liked
to drive up on her own...

1095
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:51,458
so we'd greet each other
fresh for the weekend.

1096
01:11:53,497 --> 01:11:59,959
The train would roll in.
I'd step out...

1097
01:12:00,037 --> 01:12:06,101
and there she was.
Waiting for me.

1098
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:11,910
Always.

1099
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:30,066
Rebecca and I
are in some trouble.

1100
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:36,933
Did you hear what I said?

1101
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:42,240
Now what did you do wrong?

1102
01:12:42,313 --> 01:12:44,873
She thinks
I'm having an affair.

1103
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:48,145
With another woman?

1104
01:12:49,853 --> 01:12:53,050
Yeah. Dad.
With another woman.

1105
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:55,591
It doesn't surprise me.

1106
01:12:55,659 --> 01:12:58,753
What do you mean.
It doesn't surprise you?

1107
01:12:58,829 --> 01:13:03,095
You never had a real sense
of follow-through.

1108
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:06,796
See? I mean. That's it.
I'm trying to talk to you...

1109
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,838
and you can't have
one minute go by...

1110
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,373
without trying to insult me?

1111
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:13,501
I'm just telling it like it is.

1112
01:13:13,577 --> 01:13:15,738
Like it is
or how you'd like to see it?

1113
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:18,680
Just because your old man
was a cold-hearted prick...

1114
01:13:18,749 --> 01:13:22,207
doesn't mean that you and I
got to be that way. Dad.

1115
01:13:22,286 --> 01:13:25,119
Why is it that whatever I do...

1116
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:26,918
I always feel like
it's not enough.

1117
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:29,220
I always feel like
I'm coming up short. Dad.

1118
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:31,261
Why? What is that?

1119
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:33,353
Why. Dad?

1120
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,957
What. Mom's not here
to defend you...

1121
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:38,433
you don't know what to say?

1122
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,367
She was always ready
to serve you.

1123
01:13:40,437 --> 01:13:41,836
When she was here.
She was excusing...

1124
01:13:41,905 --> 01:13:43,873
Stop.

1125
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:47,035
Don't talk about
your mother like that.

1126
01:13:47,111 --> 01:13:49,579
I will talk about her
any way I want...

1127
01:13:49,646 --> 01:13:53,514
because she is my mother.
And. Dad...

1128
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:55,552
you're my father.

1129
01:13:55,619 --> 01:13:58,110
Couldn't you just at least...

1130
01:13:58,188 --> 01:14:03,387
have a little bit
of approval about my life?

1131
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,223
Is that really
going to kill you...

1132
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:07,126
just to give me
maybe that much?

1133
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:11,227
What? What do you
want me to say?

1134
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:13,235
That I love you?

1135
01:14:22,112 --> 01:14:26,708
You know.
I'm not like your mother.

1136
01:14:26,784 --> 01:14:29,878
I can't say everything
out loud.

1137
01:14:29,953 --> 01:14:34,253
It doesn't mean I don't.

1138
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:42,123
And I love you. Too. Dad.

1139
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:53,709
I'm not always proud
of my behavior.

1140
01:14:53,777 --> 01:14:56,177
Nobody is. Nobody.

1141
01:14:59,383 --> 01:15:04,286
And. Alex. You're a much
better father than I was.

1142
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:08,648
Thank you.

1143
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:12,024
But you didn't exactly
set the bar all that high.

1144
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,702
Come on. Let's go home.

1145
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:54,900
To the side if you're
gonna stop. Please!

1146
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,551
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1147
01:16:12,623 --> 01:16:14,921
- Sweet!
- There we go.

1148
01:16:17,694 --> 01:16:20,026
- You know what your problem is?
- What's my problem?

1149
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:22,327
You're not confused.

1150
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,663
It's painfully obvious
that you're...

1151
01:16:24,735 --> 01:16:29,069
That I'm what? Paralyzed
by the fear of failure?

1152
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:31,733
As long as you're aware of it.

1153
01:16:31,808 --> 01:16:34,038
- I couldn't sleep at night.
- Oh. No?

1154
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:35,578
I guess we're different.

1155
01:16:35,646 --> 01:16:38,444
- Why do you care?
- Why do I care?

1156
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,608
'Cause you're acting
like a pussy. That's why.

1157
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:42,618
And I don't like hanging
out with pussies.

1158
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:44,153
Pussy?

1159
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:46,348
What are you doing?

1160
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:15,344
- Wait. Wait. Wait.
- What? What's wrong?

1161
01:17:15,419 --> 01:17:16,579
Wait. Wait.

1162
01:17:16,653 --> 01:17:20,316
What? Do I have B.O.?
That's not fair.

1163
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,415
I didn't get a chance
to shower.

1164
01:17:22,492 --> 01:17:24,392
I was running
all over the place.

1165
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:27,624
- I don't want to ruin this.
- I'm sorry?

1166
01:17:27,698 --> 01:17:30,895
I just think what we have
going right now is so good.

1167
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:32,526
I don't want to rush it.

1168
01:17:32,603 --> 01:17:35,333
Are you high?

1169
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:39,899
No. I just think we should
respect the connection.

1170
01:17:39,977 --> 01:17:42,343
It's a game.

1171
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:45,609
No. I'm serious.

1172
01:17:47,884 --> 01:17:50,853
I'll call you later. OK?

1173
01:17:55,626 --> 01:17:57,287
Can I call you later?

1174
01:17:57,361 --> 01:17:59,386
Yeah.

1175
01:17:59,463 --> 01:18:01,488
OK.

1176
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:08,895
Mr. Gromberg.

1177
01:18:08,972 --> 01:18:13,671
Are you OK. Sir?

1178
01:18:13,744 --> 01:18:15,473
The usual.

1179
01:18:15,545 --> 01:18:17,445
- Yes. Sir.
- Thank you.

1180
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:53,614
Abby Staley.

1181
01:19:06,697 --> 01:19:08,961
Hey. Eli. You want
to go get a drink?

1182
01:19:09,032 --> 01:19:10,363
No. I'm good.

1183
01:19:10,434 --> 01:19:12,402
All right.
Talk to you later.

1184
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:21,639
- Hey.
- What?

1185
01:19:21,712 --> 01:19:24,340
How come you're
just standing here?

1186
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:26,245
How come you look
like a banker?

1187
01:19:26,316 --> 01:19:28,181
I don't know.

1188
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:31,584
My dad bought me this.

1189
01:19:31,655 --> 01:19:33,418
I like your bracelets.

1190
01:19:35,892 --> 01:19:37,826
Do you? Or are you making
a dick of yourself...

1191
01:19:37,894 --> 01:19:39,657
being nice to the runaway?

1192
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:42,290
No. I do. They're nice.

1193
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:47,301
Do you dance?

1194
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,669
Here? No.

1195
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:52,572
But I would get
the hell out of here.

1196
01:20:11,128 --> 01:20:13,528
So. How did Eli look
for the dance tonight?

1197
01:20:13,597 --> 01:20:16,191
If you had been here
to see him off...

1198
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:18,996
maybe you wouldn't have to ask.

1199
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:23,062
A little early for bed
tonight. Isn't it?

1200
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:27,541
Excuse me.

1201
01:20:34,484 --> 01:20:37,146
How long are you going
to keep freezing me out?

1202
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,245
I don't know.

1203
01:20:40,957 --> 01:20:43,619
I need time. All right?

1204
01:20:50,967 --> 01:20:54,733
Bec. I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

1205
01:20:54,805 --> 01:20:57,069
So am I.

1206
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:04,308
I'm sorry and sad
and exhausted!

1207
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:06,679
Oh. God. Just...

1208
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,878
talk to Barney.

1209
01:21:11,688 --> 01:21:13,178
It's my father.

1210
01:21:13,256 --> 01:21:15,451
Oh. Better!

1211
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:16,651
Yes. Dad.

1212
01:21:19,162 --> 01:21:20,527
What?

1213
01:21:26,436 --> 01:21:31,533
If you would just sign here.
And that should do it.

1214
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:33,075
Your late brother's remains...

1215
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:34,044
are now officially
in your custody.

1216
01:21:34,045 --> 01:21:36,672
Are now officially
in your custody.

1217
01:21:36,746 --> 01:21:40,944
My deepest condolences.

1218
01:21:41,017 --> 01:21:43,281
Thank you.

1219
01:21:43,353 --> 01:21:47,221
I'm assuming you've made
suitable arrangements?

1220
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,723
Don't worry.

1221
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:53,752
We will see that he gets
a fitting burial.

1222
01:22:16,786 --> 01:22:18,515
Asher!

1223
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:20,249
What's up. Man?

1224
01:22:20,323 --> 01:22:23,486
Prolific.

1225
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,051
Just waiting on my muse.

1226
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:28,620
She's a bit tardy
this evening. No?

1227
01:22:28,698 --> 01:22:30,825
Or should I say this semester?

1228
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:33,699
She'll be here. Man.
She'll be here.

1229
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:36,068
As we await her arrival...

1230
01:22:36,139 --> 01:22:39,336
how about we do
a little drinky-poo?

1231
01:23:16,813 --> 01:23:18,838
Jeez. Pappy was right.

1232
01:23:18,915 --> 01:23:21,884
- What?
- Nothing. What's up?

1233
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:24,318
I could hear you all
the way down in the lobby.

1234
01:23:24,387 --> 01:23:26,878
It's really loud.

1235
01:23:26,957 --> 01:23:29,721
This is my buddy
from down the hall.

1236
01:23:29,793 --> 01:23:31,658
Don't be fooled
by his fancy grammar.

1237
01:23:31,728 --> 01:23:35,027
He's really kind of
a slimeball.

1238
01:23:35,098 --> 01:23:37,191
Malik. This is Peg.

1239
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:38,894
It's a great pleasure
to meet you.

1240
01:23:38,969 --> 01:23:40,596
See what I'm saying?

1241
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:42,262
I thought I'd surprise you.

1242
01:23:42,339 --> 01:23:44,864
It's a nice surprise.

1243
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:47,501
- Chablis 2002.
- Boxed wine.

1244
01:23:47,577 --> 01:23:50,375
I liked
the rectangular element.

1245
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,780
- I'll take it.
- Take a seat.

1246
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:57,149
So. What have you guys
been up to?

1247
01:23:58,989 --> 01:24:00,251
Cramming.

1248
01:24:00,323 --> 01:24:01,255
Yeah.

1249
01:24:01,324 --> 01:24:03,417
For what. Chemistry?

1250
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:11,598
Well. Perhaps you'd like to try
an experiment or two.

1251
01:24:13,636 --> 01:24:16,332
You wouldn't lead me
astray. Would you?

1252
01:24:16,406 --> 01:24:19,000
No. No way.

1253
01:24:19,075 --> 01:24:21,635
No way.

1254
01:24:21,711 --> 01:24:23,679
Welcome to my laboratory.

1255
01:24:41,564 --> 01:24:44,965
- I'm gonna get the sodas.
- Get me a Pepsi.

1256
01:24:49,472 --> 01:24:52,771
I don't think
the graphics were better.

1257
01:24:52,842 --> 01:24:54,275
Hey. look! Check it out!

1258
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:56,505
Over there! Let's get 'em!

1259
01:24:58,715 --> 01:25:00,876
- Abby Staley!
- With a pet!

1260
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:03,418
Quick. It's Shea! Let's go!
Out the back gate!

1261
01:25:03,486 --> 01:25:05,317
Where the hell are you going?
Come here!

1262
01:25:05,388 --> 01:25:07,788
Leave me alone!

1263
01:25:07,857 --> 01:25:10,155
What. You don't like me
anymore. Abby?

1264
01:25:10,226 --> 01:25:12,217
- You're a good kid. Aren't you?
- Leave him alone!

1265
01:25:12,295 --> 01:25:14,092
What. He can't speak
for himself?

1266
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:17,429
Leave him alone.
You shithead.

1267
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,491
You believe the language?

1268
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:20,729
Sixth grade gutter whore.

1269
01:25:20,804 --> 01:25:23,272
You think I wouldn't find you?

1270
01:25:23,339 --> 01:25:26,331
That's your little game.
Huh. Abby?

1271
01:25:26,409 --> 01:25:29,105
Leave me alone. My brother
will beat the shit out of you.

1272
01:25:30,447 --> 01:25:31,778
That's for your brother.

1273
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:34,316
- Leave her alone. Shithead!
- Get him!

1274
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:37,513
You little rat!

1275
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:43,320
Shit! He broke my Tony Hawk!
Damn it!

1276
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,191
He broke my goddamn board!

1277
01:25:46,262 --> 01:25:49,527
Go get her! Come on!

1278
01:25:49,599 --> 01:25:51,567
Get up!

1279
01:25:51,634 --> 01:25:53,693
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

1280
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:55,931
Come on! Let's go!

1281
01:25:57,307 --> 01:25:59,605
- Come on!
- You all right. Shea?

1282
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:28,000
Please be careful.
Can you handle it?

1283
01:26:28,071 --> 01:26:30,039
Yeah. I got it.

1284
01:26:30,106 --> 01:26:31,630
I think so.

1285
01:26:37,814 --> 01:26:40,282
OK. We'll put him in the bow.

1286
01:26:42,919 --> 01:26:45,854
Now. Watch out
for the ledge right there.

1287
01:26:45,922 --> 01:26:48,049
Yeah. Dad. Where's the bow?

1288
01:26:53,429 --> 01:26:54,987
Right in here.

1289
01:26:57,233 --> 01:27:02,034
Shit. My back.
Christ. My back.

1290
01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:04,903
Dad. What are you doing?
You could hurt yourself.

1291
01:27:04,974 --> 01:27:06,942
Someone has to do it.

1292
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:16,245
Dad. This is absurd.
This is totally absurd.

1293
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:18,310
It is not.

1294
01:27:18,388 --> 01:27:23,382
He lived by the sea.
Now he dies by the sea.

1295
01:27:23,459 --> 01:27:25,791
This is not a sea. Dad.

1296
01:27:25,862 --> 01:27:28,228
This is Lake Winnipac.
It's not the Atlantic.

1297
01:27:28,298 --> 01:27:32,098
It's a sailor's sky tonight.

1298
01:27:32,168 --> 01:27:35,296
He was in the navy. Dad.
He wasn't a Viking.

1299
01:27:35,371 --> 01:27:38,636
This is what he always wanted.

1300
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:41,040
This is what he gets.

1301
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:42,907
Dad. We got
neighbors here. OK?

1302
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,970
The hell with them!

1303
01:27:54,824 --> 01:27:57,224
Jesus.

1304
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:05,430
Dad?

1305
01:28:05,501 --> 01:28:10,200
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1306
01:28:10,273 --> 01:28:13,106
He held on for a while.
Didn't he?

1307
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:16,634
The only way he knew how.

1308
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:20,410
You could have learned
a thing or two from him.

1309
01:28:20,483 --> 01:28:21,973
No. I did.

1310
01:28:22,051 --> 01:28:26,078
I learned how to tie
36 different ship knots.

1311
01:28:26,155 --> 01:28:28,419
The hell with knots.

1312
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:30,857
The man had character.

1313
01:28:30,927 --> 01:28:33,487
You could have learned
that from him.

1314
01:28:33,596 --> 01:28:35,496
I tried to learn that from you.

1315
01:28:44,907 --> 01:28:46,397
I'm getting blisters.

1316
01:28:46,476 --> 01:28:48,410
Let's go over here.

1317
01:29:03,693 --> 01:29:07,151
So. How come you hang out with
that asshole morgan Cooper?

1318
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,288
I don't know.

1319
01:29:08,364 --> 01:29:11,333
How come you ran away
with that guy?

1320
01:29:11,401 --> 01:29:14,029
I don't know.
Thought he was cool. I guess.

1321
01:29:14,103 --> 01:29:15,730
Was he?

1322
01:29:15,805 --> 01:29:17,830
No.

1323
01:29:17,907 --> 01:29:19,772
Where'd you go?

1324
01:29:19,842 --> 01:29:21,673
Cape Cod.

1325
01:29:21,744 --> 01:29:24,235
Why'd you come back?

1326
01:29:24,314 --> 01:29:28,250
I don't know.
Guess I got bored.

1327
01:29:28,318 --> 01:29:30,013
Were you homesick?

1328
01:29:30,086 --> 01:29:31,883
Hell. No.

1329
01:29:35,758 --> 01:29:37,555
I don't know.

1330
01:29:37,627 --> 01:29:40,892
Maybe. A little.

1331
01:29:40,963 --> 01:29:42,794
I get homesick
when I go to camp.

1332
01:29:42,865 --> 01:29:46,858
That's 'cause camp sucks.

1333
01:29:46,936 --> 01:29:48,836
Are your parents
as boring and angry...

1334
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:51,373
and always screaming
at each other like mine?

1335
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:52,499
Kind of.

1336
01:29:52,575 --> 01:29:54,805
Do they never
talk to you like mine?

1337
01:29:54,877 --> 01:29:57,778
No. My parents are
always talking to me.

1338
01:29:57,847 --> 01:30:00,407
They ask me questions
whenever they can.

1339
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:02,212
You're lucky.

1340
01:30:02,285 --> 01:30:05,584
No. I'm not. You're lucky.

1341
01:30:10,259 --> 01:30:12,124
It's OK.

1342
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:17,963
You really do like it.

1343
01:30:20,803 --> 01:30:22,794
How come you haven't
tried to kiss me?

1344
01:30:22,872 --> 01:30:25,966
What? I don't know.

1345
01:30:27,877 --> 01:30:29,708
Do you want to?

1346
01:30:29,779 --> 01:30:32,339
I don't know.

1347
01:30:32,415 --> 01:30:36,579
'Cause. Like. You can.
You know. If you want to.

1348
01:30:36,652 --> 01:30:40,213
No. Thank you.

1349
01:30:42,325 --> 01:30:44,850
OK.

1350
01:31:08,418 --> 01:31:10,716
Go. Asher.

1351
01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:12,880
Break it down. Asher.

1352
01:31:14,357 --> 01:31:15,790
Go. Asher. Go. Asher.

1353
01:31:18,261 --> 01:31:19,353
Police!

1354
01:31:19,429 --> 01:31:23,092
What's going on here?
What's all this noise?

1355
01:31:27,703 --> 01:31:29,637
Asher! Asher!

1356
01:31:29,705 --> 01:31:31,468
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

1357
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:32,838
What are you doing?

1358
01:31:32,909 --> 01:31:33,967
Against the wall.

1359
01:31:34,043 --> 01:31:36,944
Spread your legs.
Spread your legs.

1360
01:31:37,013 --> 01:31:37,980
Asher!

1361
01:31:38,047 --> 01:31:39,605
I'm so sorry. Peg.

1362
01:31:39,682 --> 01:31:43,846
I'll give you something
to be sorry about.

1363
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,478
My keys. My keys.

1364
01:31:48,658 --> 01:31:51,092
Asher.

1365
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,991
What have you gotten into?

1366
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:55,288
What's happening?

1367
01:31:55,364 --> 01:31:56,888
Hey. No talking.

1368
01:31:56,966 --> 01:31:58,365
Jesus.

1369
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:00,902
Jesus. Man.
What are you doing?

1370
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:04,599
I can't believe I trusted you.

1371
01:32:04,674 --> 01:32:05,868
Closet back here?

1372
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:08,604
No. I don't know.
It's not mine.

1373
01:32:08,678 --> 01:32:09,645
Yeah. Right.

1374
01:32:09,712 --> 01:32:11,873
Let's get this
out of the way.

1375
01:32:11,948 --> 01:32:13,677
Move that thing.

1376
01:32:16,285 --> 01:32:17,217
You got a key for this?

1377
01:32:17,286 --> 01:32:19,254
No. I told you.
I've never used it before.

1378
01:32:19,322 --> 01:32:21,119
Come on. Get something...
anything.

1379
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:22,851
Give me the door lock.

1380
01:32:22,925 --> 01:32:24,119
Asher.

1381
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,367
Oh. My God.

1382
01:32:33,769 --> 01:32:35,100
Holy shit.

1383
01:32:35,171 --> 01:32:36,570
Jackpot.

1384
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,130
How about this
for a noise complaint?

1385
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:41,039
Wow. We're looking
at fiFTeen years here.

1386
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:43,840
What do you think? There must
be eight plants in here.

1387
01:32:43,913 --> 01:32:45,847
I don't want anything
to do with you ever again.

1388
01:32:45,915 --> 01:32:48,907
Peg. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

1389
01:32:48,985 --> 01:32:50,418
I'll do something. I promise.

1390
01:32:50,486 --> 01:32:52,351
I can see the headlines now...

1391
01:32:52,421 --> 01:32:56,356
"Father and son burn uncle
in makeshiFT Viking funeral.

1392
01:32:56,425 --> 01:33:00,122
"Wife and children shamed."

1393
01:33:00,196 --> 01:33:02,426
Is this legal. Dad?

1394
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:06,896
All right. So what do we do?

1395
01:33:06,969 --> 01:33:09,802
We say something or...

1396
01:33:09,872 --> 01:33:11,669
It's not about words.

1397
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:13,709
I'm sorry. Of course.
You've done this before.

1398
01:33:13,776 --> 01:33:18,145
It's about this man's
connection with the sea.

1399
01:33:18,214 --> 01:33:21,479
It's not about you or me...

1400
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:24,384
or words of grace.

1401
01:33:24,453 --> 01:33:26,785
Push it to the water line.

1402
01:33:26,856 --> 01:33:27,982
All right.

1403
01:33:35,498 --> 01:33:36,965
Now...

1404
01:33:38,267 --> 01:33:40,929
when I say. "Ahoy"...

1405
01:33:41,003 --> 01:33:43,597
give it a big shove
out to sea.

1406
01:33:43,673 --> 01:33:46,164
Aye. Aye. Captain.

1407
01:33:46,242 --> 01:33:48,267
Sorry. Dad.

1408
01:33:50,513 --> 01:33:52,708
Look. We don't have to do this.
You know that.

1409
01:33:52,782 --> 01:33:54,909
We're doing it.

1410
01:33:56,886 --> 01:33:58,911
Ahoy. Ahoy!

1411
01:34:46,736 --> 01:34:48,601
We got to go. Dad.

1412
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:50,263
Dad. Dad. Come on.
We got to go.

1413
01:34:50,339 --> 01:34:53,399
Dad. We got to go.

1414
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:02,448
Thank you. Alex.

1415
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,478
Thank you.

1416
01:35:20,202 --> 01:35:21,863
You know. We could go to jail.

1417
01:35:21,937 --> 01:35:25,896
If we're lucky.
We might be cellmates.

1418
01:35:28,844 --> 01:35:30,937
Yeah. Hi. Honey.

1419
01:35:33,282 --> 01:35:34,715
What?

1420
01:35:36,786 --> 01:35:39,448
Bec. Is he OK?
Where is he?

1421
01:35:39,522 --> 01:35:42,616
They're processing his papers.
They had to fingerprint him.

1422
01:35:42,692 --> 01:35:43,716
Oh. Jesus.

1423
01:35:43,793 --> 01:35:45,454
He'll probably get off.
The little sneak.

1424
01:35:45,528 --> 01:35:47,086
The police
didn't have a warrant.

1425
01:35:47,163 --> 01:35:49,256
- Thank God.
- He's always getting off.

1426
01:35:49,331 --> 01:35:51,390
That's part
of the problem. Alex.

1427
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:54,027
It can't go on like this
any longer.

1428
01:35:56,372 --> 01:35:59,034
Look at us.
Can you believe this?

1429
01:35:59,108 --> 01:36:01,235
You OK?

1430
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:03,904
I'm still here. Aren't I?

1431
01:36:16,092 --> 01:36:18,026
Asher. Honey.

1432
01:36:18,094 --> 01:36:20,153
I didn't know the shit
was there. Mom. I swear.

1433
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:23,426
Save it. Asher. Do you realize
how serious this is?

1434
01:36:27,503 --> 01:36:29,061
I'm so sorry. Dad.

1435
01:36:29,138 --> 01:36:31,538
I'm sorry. Too. Buddy.

1436
01:36:31,607 --> 01:36:33,040
I'm sorry. Too.

1437
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:34,098
Oh. God.

1438
01:36:34,176 --> 01:36:35,666
Asher. Do you know
you could've gotten...

1439
01:36:35,745 --> 01:36:38,077
up to fiFTeen years for this?

1440
01:36:38,147 --> 01:36:39,341
I'm such a screw-up.

1441
01:36:39,415 --> 01:36:41,042
You're not.
You are not a screw-up.

1442
01:36:41,117 --> 01:36:43,142
- Yes. I am.
- You're not.

1443
01:36:43,219 --> 01:36:44,584
Does Pappy have
to see me this way?

1444
01:36:44,653 --> 01:36:48,089
Everything's screwed up. Dad.

1445
01:36:48,157 --> 01:36:49,419
Everything's shit. Dad.

1446
01:36:49,492 --> 01:36:52,325
I was with this girl
who was there.

1447
01:36:52,394 --> 01:36:54,259
She didn't do anything.

1448
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:56,696
I don't know where she is.
She's going to hate me now.

1449
01:36:56,766 --> 01:36:58,631
This just gets
better and better.

1450
01:36:58,701 --> 01:36:59,929
It's OK. It's OK.

1451
01:37:00,002 --> 01:37:01,799
You have to help her.
Please. Dad.

1452
01:37:01,871 --> 01:37:03,304
We got to make sure
she's all right.

1453
01:37:03,372 --> 01:37:05,272
It's all right. Asher.
We'll take care of her.

1454
01:37:05,341 --> 01:37:07,935
Don't worry about her.
She'll be all right.

1455
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:09,807
There was no search warrant.
Thank God.

1456
01:37:09,879 --> 01:37:10,868
It's OK.

1457
01:37:10,946 --> 01:37:14,347
And I've also screwed up
with school. Mom.

1458
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:15,974
I'm going to have to go
back for another year.

1459
01:37:16,051 --> 01:37:17,985
You're failing
your senior year?

1460
01:37:18,053 --> 01:37:19,315
My life is shit!

1461
01:37:19,388 --> 01:37:20,787
You're a bright kid.
For God's sake.

1462
01:37:20,856 --> 01:37:22,983
I just couldn't do it.
I couldn't get into it.

1463
01:37:23,058 --> 01:37:25,083
What the hell can you do?
Sell drugs?

1464
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:27,026
Now. Wait a minute.
Let's face this. All right?

1465
01:37:27,096 --> 01:37:29,462
We have all been in our own
little worlds. Haven't we?

1466
01:37:29,532 --> 01:37:31,796
It's going to stop right now.

1467
01:37:31,867 --> 01:37:35,303
We're a family. We're going
to figure this out together.

1468
01:37:35,371 --> 01:37:37,430
Figure what out?
This? And school and...

1469
01:37:37,506 --> 01:37:40,031
And everything else.
That's right.

1470
01:37:41,677 --> 01:37:45,841
Asher. You're not
a kid anymore.

1471
01:37:45,915 --> 01:37:49,612
You got to find out what
is important in your life...

1472
01:37:49,685 --> 01:37:54,713
what do you love. And you let
nothing get in the way of it.

1473
01:37:56,458 --> 01:38:01,452
Asher. Listen to your father.

1474
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:04,465
He knows what
he's talking about.

1475
01:38:06,468 --> 01:38:08,493
Oh. God.

1476
01:38:08,571 --> 01:38:09,833
Who's calling you now?

1477
01:38:09,905 --> 01:38:12,499
I don't know.
This is probably a patient.

1478
01:38:12,575 --> 01:38:13,507
Hello.

1479
01:38:13,576 --> 01:38:15,510
- Mrs. Gromberg?
- Yes.

1480
01:38:15,578 --> 01:38:17,944
This is mrs. Hodgson.
Is Eli with you?

1481
01:38:18,013 --> 01:38:19,002
What?

1482
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:20,480
He disappeared
from the dance tonight...

1483
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:31,686
Is he in there?

1484
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,057
Yeah.

1485
01:38:41,937 --> 01:38:44,371
You are staying here
with us tonight.

1486
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:47,034
I don't want you
out of my sight.

1487
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:48,269
Where should I sleep?

1488
01:38:48,344 --> 01:38:51,802
Why don't you sleep
in your old room with Eli?

1489
01:38:51,881 --> 01:38:54,179
We've got a lot
of talking to do.

1490
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,342
But in the morning.

1491
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:58,079
I couldn't take one more
surprise tonight.

1492
01:38:58,153 --> 01:38:59,245
Good night. Honey.

1493
01:38:59,321 --> 01:39:01,118
I'm going to bed.

1494
01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:03,317
- Good night. Mom.
- Good night. Boys.

1495
01:39:03,392 --> 01:39:04,882
What about me?

1496
01:39:06,495 --> 01:39:07,962
What about you?

1497
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:09,895
Where do I sleep?

1498
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:13,898
Couch.

1499
01:39:28,851 --> 01:39:30,614
What are you doing?

1500
01:39:30,686 --> 01:39:32,620
I was getting
in bed with my wife.

1501
01:39:32,688 --> 01:39:37,318
Are you out of your mind?
Aren't things confusing enough?

1502
01:39:37,393 --> 01:39:39,884
We have two kids.
Both of them weird.

1503
01:39:39,962 --> 01:39:41,327
Very weird. Alex.

1504
01:39:41,397 --> 01:39:43,695
One of them is a drug dealer.
And the other one is...

1505
01:39:43,766 --> 01:39:45,927
What's Eli? He's what?

1506
01:39:46,001 --> 01:39:47,628
I don't know
what the other one is.

1507
01:39:47,703 --> 01:39:51,639
But. Alex. Do you want
to work at this?

1508
01:39:51,707 --> 01:39:53,766
- Yes.
- Really work at this?

1509
01:39:53,842 --> 01:39:55,104
Yes. I do. Yes.

1510
01:39:55,177 --> 01:39:56,610
Will you see her again?

1511
01:39:56,679 --> 01:40:01,912
No. I'm not...
I wasn't seeing her.

1512
01:40:01,984 --> 01:40:05,181
Look. Rebecca.
I got sidetracked...

1513
01:40:05,254 --> 01:40:09,520
with the office
and the soup kitchen...

1514
01:40:09,591 --> 01:40:12,389
and I wasn't paying attention.

1515
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:21,693
Life... it's always getting
in the way of us. Isn't it?

1516
01:40:23,272 --> 01:40:24,239
Yeah.

1517
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:29,002
- The couch.
- Rebecca.

1518
01:40:29,078 --> 01:40:30,739
The couch.

1519
01:40:36,852 --> 01:40:38,911
- Alex?
- Yeah.

1520
01:40:40,456 --> 01:40:43,357
In the morning. There are
three things you can do.

1521
01:40:43,425 --> 01:40:45,620
You can get our son
a good lawyer...

1522
01:40:45,694 --> 01:40:49,357
find us a marriage counselor...

1523
01:40:49,431 --> 01:40:51,865
and you can wash the dishes...

1524
01:40:53,202 --> 01:40:55,568
in our kitchen.

1525
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:01,373
I love you. Bec.
Good night.

1526
01:41:04,179 --> 01:41:06,875
I love you. Too.

1527
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,120
What the hell
are you doing. Dad?

1528
01:41:16,191 --> 01:41:18,159
Insulin.

1529
01:41:18,227 --> 01:41:20,889
Your mother used to do this.

1530
01:41:27,202 --> 01:41:28,999
You going to be
comfortable here?

1531
01:41:29,071 --> 01:41:34,236
In the war. I slept
in blood-filled trenches.

1532
01:41:34,309 --> 01:41:35,901
Hope you don't mind
if I join you.

1533
01:41:35,978 --> 01:41:38,879
No. You take this couch.

1534
01:41:40,616 --> 01:41:42,208
Thanks. Dad.

1535
01:41:44,353 --> 01:41:46,913
Still in the doghouse?

1536
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:54,658
Well. Dad. I thought
we'd relive my childhood.

1537
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:57,130
You know. All those nights
we went out camping together.

1538
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:58,666
Yeah. I remember.

1539
01:41:58,734 --> 01:42:02,170
- Oh. Yeah. In your dreams.
- You were a pain in the ass.

1540
01:42:02,237 --> 01:42:06,833
Yeah. We had a lot of nights
out together. Didn't we. Dad?

1541
01:42:06,909 --> 01:42:09,707
You should've seen him.
He was. Like. Seven feet tall.

1542
01:42:09,778 --> 01:42:12,975
Huge. Like The Rock.
When he swung his board at me...

1543
01:42:13,048 --> 01:42:15,107
I just put my fist
right through it.

1544
01:42:15,184 --> 01:42:17,345
Broke it in half...
A Tony Hawk. Too.

1545
01:42:17,419 --> 01:42:19,250
And when he got up.
He charged at me.

1546
01:42:19,321 --> 01:42:21,812
But I just went like this.
And I kicked him in the shin.

1547
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:24,188
Then I went...

1548
01:42:24,259 --> 01:42:27,228
right in his mug.
Laid him out.

1549
01:42:27,296 --> 01:42:30,094
Smack in the kisser.

1550
01:42:30,165 --> 01:42:31,655
Good night. Boys!

1551
01:42:31,733 --> 01:42:32,961
Good night. Eli!

1552
01:42:33,035 --> 01:42:34,832
Good night. Pappy.
Good night. Dad.

1553
01:42:34,903 --> 01:42:36,131
Night. Dad. Night. Pappy.

1554
01:42:36,205 --> 01:42:37,763
Good night. Mom.

1555
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,864
Night. Mom.

1556
01:42:38,941 --> 01:42:44,401
Good night.

1557
01:42:46,014 --> 01:42:48,983
You'll never know

1558
01:42:49,051 --> 01:42:51,679
How much I love you

1559
01:43:00,829 --> 01:43:04,094
How many verses
do you know. Dad?

1560
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:08,432
It's a lullaby
that puts me to sleep.

1561
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:14,843
It's keeping me awake.

1562
01:43:19,615 --> 01:43:21,480
Bro.

1563
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:24,018
What's that bracelet all about?

1564
01:43:24,086 --> 01:43:26,577
You get that for taking care
of your lady?

1565
01:43:26,655 --> 01:43:31,456
No. Man. That's
a good thing. Buddy.

1566
01:43:31,527 --> 01:43:33,461
I wish I had done the same.

1567
01:43:37,733 --> 01:43:41,794
I'll never find

1568
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:43,098
I never could hide

1569
01:43:43,172 --> 01:43:49,338
I guess I'm not the father
I thought I was.

1570
01:43:49,411 --> 01:43:53,541
I got one kid
who could be in the can.

1571
01:43:53,615 --> 01:43:56,015
And the other one...

1572
01:43:56,084 --> 01:43:58,416
There's something about him.
I don't know what it is.

1573
01:43:58,487 --> 01:44:03,186
You know. When we were kids.
Stephen and I...

1574
01:44:03,258 --> 01:44:05,317
we got in trouble
with the cops.

1575
01:44:05,394 --> 01:44:08,386
Really? You never told me.
What for?

1576
01:44:08,463 --> 01:44:11,830
Selling booze
that fell off a truck.

1577
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:14,198
We did OK. Too.

1578
01:44:21,243 --> 01:44:23,939
Dad. I'm thinking about
leaving the firm.

1579
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:30,110
I want to try
public office again.

1580
01:44:30,185 --> 01:44:35,714
I've waited ten years
to hear you say that.

1581
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:37,952
Really?

1582
01:44:38,026 --> 01:44:40,893
Maybe this time
you'll vote for me?

1583
01:44:45,267 --> 01:44:47,929
Not a chance in hell.

1584
01:45:06,021 --> 01:45:07,989
Dad. You're not planning
on this becoming...

1585
01:45:08,056 --> 01:45:10,286
a permanent arrangement.
Are you?

1586
01:45:10,359 --> 01:45:12,384
Don't worry.

1587
01:45:12,461 --> 01:45:18,627
The doctor says I've only got
a few good years.

1588
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:20,429
Don't worry.

1589
01:45:27,509 --> 01:45:28,976
You'll never know

1590
01:45:29,044 --> 01:45:34,544
Just how much I miss you

1591
01:45:39,688 --> 01:45:41,781
You'll never know

1592
01:45:41,857 --> 01:45:47,727
Just how much I care

1593
01:45:51,233 --> 01:45:54,225
And if I tried

1594
01:45:54,303 --> 01:45:57,272
I still couldn't hide

1595
01:45:57,339 --> 01:46:00,604
my love for you

1596
01:46:04,046 --> 01:46:06,412
You ought to know

1597
01:46:06,481 --> 01:46:11,976
For haven't I told you so

1598
01:46:12,054 --> 01:46:15,854
A million or more times

1599
01:46:15,924 --> 01:46:19,291
You went away

1600
01:46:19,361 --> 01:46:23,991
And my heart went with you

1601
01:46:28,603 --> 01:46:31,504
I speak your name

1602
01:46:31,573 --> 01:46:35,907
In my every prayer

1603
01:46:39,414 --> 01:46:43,145
If there is some other way

1604
01:46:43,218 --> 01:46:46,449
To prove that I love you

1605
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:51,390
I swear I don't know how

1606
01:46:53,528 --> 01:46:55,086
You'll never know

1607
01:46:55,163 --> 01:46:59,827
If you don't know now

1608
01:47:54,156 --> 01:47:57,284
You went away

1609
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:01,523
And my heart went with you

1610
01:48:06,601 --> 01:48:09,399
I speak your name

1611
01:48:09,471 --> 01:48:14,067
In my every prayer

1612
01:48:16,978 --> 01:48:21,039
If there is some other way

1613
01:48:21,116 --> 01:48:24,108
To prove that I love you

1614
01:48:24,186 --> 01:48:29,283
I swear I don't know how

1615
01:48:30,826 --> 01:48:32,555
You'll never know

1616
01:48:32,627 --> 01:48:38,190
If you don't know now

1617
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:45,531
If there is some other way

1618
01:48:45,607 --> 01:48:48,576
To prove that I love you

1619
01:48:48,643 --> 01:48:55,549
I swear I don't know how

1620
01:48:55,617 --> 01:48:57,312
You'll never know

1621
01:48:57,385 --> 01:49:04,553
If you don't know now
