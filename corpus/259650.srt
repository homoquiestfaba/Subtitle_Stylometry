1
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,061
Come on.

2
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,700
This is ridiculous.

3
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,567
What is the deal
with these people?

4
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,676
KCBG.
Who are you holding for?

5
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,312
Listen, I've been trying
to get ahold of Lori Tanner...

6
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,880
for the last ten minutes.

7
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,116
I'm sorry. She's not picking up
in her office right now.

8
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,119
Yeah, well, tell her
she just lost her story.

9
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,488
Hold on. Maybe she's
somewhere else in the building.

10
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,290
Let me try and locate her.

11
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,027
Wrinkle-free dirt-repellent
polyester...

12
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,895
Is this working for you so far?

13
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,832
Is trying to make a comeback
from the disco decade.

14
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,936
Edit bay one.

15
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,571
Yeah, hold on a second.

16
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,907
...is finding new life
among top clothing designers.

17
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,611
Hi, this is Judy Sanders
over at Emax.

18
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,614
Oh, God, Judy!
Thanks for calling me back.

19
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,616
It's not my fault we're stuck
with this lightweight...

20
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,418
Shh! It's important.

21
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,919
I didn't expect
to hear from you again.

22
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,090
Look, I can sneak you
into the lab tomorrow night...

23
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,192
if you've still got
that five hundred you promised.

24
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,228
Yeah, yeah.
I just have to make sure...

25
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,429
you can get me in
to see the animals.

26
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,331
I got to know exactly
what's being done to them.

27
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,498
No problem.

28
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,835
Why don't you meet me
at 8:30 at the north gate?

29
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,404
And don't be late. I can't
afford to get in trouble.

30
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,274
I'll be there.

31
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,367
Yes! Yes!

32
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,153
Good morning, Mr. Perez.

33
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,022
Buenas dias, Senor Perez.

34
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,616
Buenas dias, Senor Perez.

35
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,629
How are you, Mrs. Perez?

36
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,331
Como esta usted, Senora Perez?

37
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,425
Como esta usted, senora?

38
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,238
How are you, Miss Perez?

39
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,807
Como esta usted,
Senorita Perez?

40
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,900
Como esta... shut up!

41
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,748
- Hello, sir.
- Hola, senor.

42
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,517
Hola, senor.

43
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,819
- Hello, madame.
- Hola, senora.

44
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,650
Hola, sen...

45
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,616
Ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,265
I am pleased to meet you.

47
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,426
Mucho gusto en conocerle.

48
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,162
- Thank you.
- Gracias.

49
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,274
- Please.
- Por favor.

50
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,911
- Goodbye.
- Adios.

51
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,513
This is exactly the type
of story I've been looking for.

52
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,349
What do you know
about animal rights?

53
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,983
You have a parrot
that can't stand you.

54
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,685
It's topical. It's hard-hitting.

55
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,520
I think I can do something
significant with it.

56
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,823
Do an expose. Who knows
what goes on in that place?

57
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,192
We're already running late
on the polyester segment.

58
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,327
Polyester segment.
Please, give me a break.

59
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,162
Drip-dry suits.
That's real hard-core.

60
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,866
Excuse me, but that's what
we get paid to do around here.

61
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,634
How many times
have we had this discussion...

62
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,938
about what we'd do if we got
a chance to cover a real story?

63
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,073
No, I'm not going to let you
do this to me again.

64
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,975
You've got to shoot this one
for me, Annie. You're the best.

65
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,044
Why can't we be
like everybody else, huh?

66
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,813
It doesn't make sense to shoot
the whole story on spec.

67
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,949
We should just sell everybody
on the idea first.

68
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,752
No! Because they'll just go
and put somebody else on it.

69
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,121
The only way we're ever gonna
get to do anything real here...

70
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,724
is if we just shoot the story
and blow their socks off.

71
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,090
I'm doing this
with or without you.

72
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,530
Come on. Bring it up.

73
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,547
What is the deal? It's 9:00.

74
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,283
What's her name... Judy... said
she'd meet us here at 8:30.

75
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,682
Maybe we should just
get out of here.

76
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,379
There's no answer. Damn it.

77
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,659
What are you doing?

78
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,294
I'm sneaking in.

79
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,863
Lori.

80
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,432
Lori!

81
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,558
Wait.

82
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,731
Lori, wait for me.

83
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,975
Did your wife fix me up
with her sister yet or what?

84
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,512
On second thought, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

85
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,550
I found out she won't be
turning 18 for another 8 months.

86
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,852
Hey, that's perfect, man.

87
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,822
If I was you,
I'd rewrite that personal ad.

88
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,989
Oh, come on, man.

89
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,158
I haven't gotten a date
from that personal ad.

90
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,160
Hey, listen, I was taking
a creative writing course...

91
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,528
one time in community college.

92
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,497
I'll help you with it
on my off night.

93
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,998
We'll get together,
we'll rewrite the thing.

94
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,533
Those things don't work.

95
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,536
I got one more inside
we got to get.

96
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,937
So, yeah, we'll just get
together, like, Wednesday night.

97
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,506
What's that smell?

98
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,783
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

99
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,290
Shoot it. Shoot it.

100
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,416
OK.

101
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,629
I don't eat doughnuts all day.

102
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,998
I eat doughnuts in the evening.
I eat candy bars in the morning.

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,667
Listen, you should try driving
with this shit in your trunk.

104
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,835
You ever get a whiff
of this shit?

105
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,071
It stinks.
I'll buy you some air freshener.

106
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,197
How do you like that?

107
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,988
This must be the place.

108
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,257
Got everything?

109
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,350
Have I ever forgotten anything
before?

110
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,521
Let's do it.

111
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,560
Oh, my God.

112
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,012
Look at this. Look at this.
Annie, tape the rabbit.

113
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,280
Got it, got it, got it.

114
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,872
Hey, pan down the row.

115
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,219
Look. They took her ear off.

116
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,888
Move in on this one. This one.

117
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,856
Look at the size of this wound.

118
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,161
Now pull back and get the name
of this monkey.

119
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,064
OK, stay out of the shot.

120
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,733
These people are sick. Look.

121
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,702
Look at her head.

122
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,804
And the tattoo on her face, too.

123
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,034
This is unbelievable.

124
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,477
- Bring your camera up here.
- Hold on, I'm coming.

125
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,913
Look at this place.
Look at this place.

126
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,883
We've got to get this whole shot
of the whole place.

127
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,153
I want people to really see
what's going on in here.

128
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,621
What kind of person
could do all this?

129
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,991
- Fifty-five, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

130
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,999
Did he take everything, Manning?

131
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes, sir, Dr. Jarret.

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,169
Meet me around back.
I got some specimens...

133
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,796
I want you to help me
take up to the lab.

134
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,899
Damn.

135
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,742
I'm not so sure about this.

136
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,690
Oh, no. Look at this.

137
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,525
Do we have enough light
to tape in here?

138
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,027
Yeah, it's good.

139
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,029
I can't believe
they're experimenting...

140
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,632
on endangered species
like these.

141
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,134
This is really strange.

142
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,203
I'm not even sure
if this is legal.

143
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,104
Annie, Annie, look at the bear.

144
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,578
Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for?

145
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,879
Be there in a second, doctor.

146
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,381
Get the other cage.

147
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,349
Get these doors here open.

148
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,770
This is a major piece.

149
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,639
We have got a real story.
This is going to work.

150
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,807
Lori.

151
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,642
What's in here?
Did you see what was in here?

152
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,344
Let's just get out of here.

153
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,836
Here we have a rare, extinct...

154
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,308
dog.

155
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,791
Let me get that for you, doctor.

156
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,527
Take these
and put them in the lab.

157
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,653
Thank you.

158
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,235
What are they
doing to you, huh?

159
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,725
I don't think
you should be doing that.

160
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,041
I want to check him out.
He's not going to do anything.

161
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,210
Hey, what are they doing to you
around here, huh?

162
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,312
Poor little guy.

163
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,682
Don't you look at me.
I didn't put you in there.

164
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,152
You were probably a lawyer
in another life, I bet.

165
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,622
What is this thing
they have on him?

166
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,793
What is this?
What are these wires?

167
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,693
Your rooms are ready.

168
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,433
Wake-up call's at 6:00.

169
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,737
You can check in,
but you can't check out.

170
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,673
- Do you have us both in frame?
- Yeah, why?

171
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,408
I want to do
the intro to the story.

172
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,310
Are you crazy?
We can do that later.

173
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,540
No, it's perfect now. Now.

174
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,354
Do I look OK?

175
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,720
- You look beautiful. Hurry up.
- Dog slobber!

176
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,331
Rolling.

177
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,666
Is this dog
really a noble sacrifice...

178
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,970
donating his life
for the betterment of mankind...

179
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,038
or is he simply
an innocent victim...

180
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,442
of the billion-dollar
vivisection industry?

181
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,311
Shit. Shit. Doggie!

182
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,946
Max! Max!

183
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,413
Get back here.

184
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,718
- Max!
- Where did he go?

185
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,886
Max?

186
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,455
Hey! Hey, hold it right there!

187
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,923
Hey, hold it!
Hold it right there! Stop!

188
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,464
Shit!

189
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,104
- Hurry!
- I'm trying! Go! Go!

190
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,072
- Jesus!
- Shit!

191
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,472
What the hell
are you doing here?

192
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,780
Max.

193
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,270
What's going on?

194
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,151
What are you doing out?

195
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,982
Sit.

196
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,849
Max.

197
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,118
Halt, Max.

198
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,522
Good boy. Good boy.

199
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
Max, you're scaring me.

200
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,772
I'm not angry with you.
I'm just tired.

201
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,275
Max...

202
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,411
final command.

203
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,003
Enter.

204
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,541
Enter.

205
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,256
Max...

206
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,382
Max.

207
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,222
Now.

208
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,125
Max!

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,002
Max!

210
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,664
God damn it!

211
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,879
- Where's the car?
- Over there.

212
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,001
Come on, come on! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

213
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,081
Just get in!
Just get in the car.

214
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,249
You don't know
what you're doing!

215
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,251
Get in!

216
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,151
Forget the dog!

217
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,780
Max! No!

218
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,296
Oh, man! Oh, man! Sucker!

219
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,765
Max!

220
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,357
No!

221
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,470
Max! Max!

222
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,308
You said they had
a video camera.

223
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,333
Any idea why?

224
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,013
About six months ago...

225
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,016
there was a group
of animal rights fanatics...

226
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,786
protesting outside the lab.

227
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,954
I called the police.

228
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,288
A couple of 'em
tried to break in.

229
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,856
Maybe that's the connection.

230
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,692
Emilio, why don't you see
if we booked anyone?

231
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,423
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
The police did nothing.

232
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,466
Exactly what kind of work
do you do here?

233
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,702
I do genetic research...

234
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,304
often using animal models.

235
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,239
You talking about vivisection?

236
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,741
Yes, I am.

237
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,909
Vivi what?

238
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,510
Vivisection...

239
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,512
those cruel experiments
they do on animals...

240
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,981
to test out new products.

241
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,850
My girlfriend talks about it
all the time.

242
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,554
She wants to make sure
things like the shampoo I use...

243
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,923
are on a cruelty-free
products list.

244
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,558
Well, your girlfriend
is rather ignorant...

245
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,561
like most of these
animal rights people.

246
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,096
You try telling her that.

247
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,531
Look. The kind of research
I do here...

248
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,002
is about saving lives,
human lives.

249
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,004
That's what's important,
isn't it?

250
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,406
I don't make eyeliner here...

251
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,508
and I don't pour acid
into monkeys' eyes...

252
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,176
or stitch them closed, either.

253
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,912
We get the picture, doc.
We'll be in touch.

254
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,015
Yeah.

255
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,850
I want Max back.

256
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,619
We're not talking about
a street mutt here.

257
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,787
We are talking about...

258
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,522
a million-dollar
research animal.

259
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
Well, for that kind of money...

260
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,855
he should be able
to find his own way home.

261
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:10,696
I'm sure not sending him back
there. You saw that dumpster.

262
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,966
I'm sure not sending him back
there. You saw that dumpster.

263
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,769
Yeah, but what are you going
to do with him in the meantime?

264
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,139
I don't know.
Guess I'll take him home.

265
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,974
Find another place for him.

266
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,409
Your boyfriend
is gonna freak out...

267
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,576
when he finds out
where you got him.

268
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,373
Oh, yeah, right. Perry?
Perry won't even notice him.

269
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,214
Give me your purse!
Give it to me!

270
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,382
You, too, bitch!
Gimme the watch!

271
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,117
OK, OK! Let her go.

272
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,219
What else you got?
Come on, what else you got?

273
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,587
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

274
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,990
- Oh, God.
- Don't do that!

275
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,425
You got any jewelry?

276
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,825
You want to watch me, mutt?
Woof!

277
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,764
Oh, shit!

278
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,835
Get that mutt away from me!

279
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,105
- Get him! Get him!
- Yeah! Yeah!

280
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,367
Shit!

281
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,744
- Jerk.
- Are you OK?

282
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,234
Son of a bitch.

283
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,951
Look at that.

284
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,010
Oh, God.

285
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,692
Max, how...
What did you do, Max?

286
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,127
Max.

287
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,424
Hey...

288
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,796
My God.
Is this dog incredible or what?

289
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,726
Oh, boy.

290
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,195
Someone's hungry, aren't they?

291
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,363
Yeah.

292
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,867
This stuff smells so disgusting.

293
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,767
Wait till
he goes to the bathroom.

294
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,403
I want to see something.
Would you sit?

295
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,813
Good boy!

296
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,075
Down.

297
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,420
Oh, that's a good boy.

298
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,422
Good boy.

299
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,224
I'm a natural at this.

300
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,193
He's a good boy. Come here.

301
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,196
You just need to have
a little scratch.

302
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,566
OK, get a really good, cute...
Oh, look at that.

303
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,601
Oh, this is great.
This is a great shot.

304
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,571
Oh, my God.
Get a close-up of this.

305
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,375
Look at the size of these scars.

306
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,077
Wait a minute.
Let's see here. Wait.

307
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,705
Somebody's been butchering you,
haven't they?

308
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,919
This is like
in a concentration camp.

309
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,121
You poor dog.

310
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,691
Max, Max, come here, Max.

311
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,027
Max, sit. Sit.

312
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,995
Max, sit.

313
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,430
You're so good.

314
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,399
You're so good, aren't you?

315
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,435
Hey, don't worry. No one's
going to hurt you again.

316
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,138
You protected me.
Now I'm going to protect you.

317
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,264
OK?

318
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,670
Damn truck.

319
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,171
Oh, thank you, Max.

320
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,517
You're sweet.

321
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,711
Turn around.

322
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,497
Baldy, baldy, baldy!

323
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,965
- Aw, screw you.
- Screw you!

324
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,379
Lori?

325
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,281
Hey, Lori!

326
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,216
Come on out. I want to show you
those new menus I got.

327
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,984
Jesus!

328
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,620
Lori, what the hell's
going on in there? You OK?

329
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,855
Max, calm down!

330
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,983
I'll be with you
in a second, honey!

331
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,332
You stay.

332
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,467
What the hell's going on?
What's that dog?

333
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,934
Honey...

334
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,407
Annie and I were attacked
in the parking lot...

335
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,741
at the market tonight.

336
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,445
Jesus. Are you all right?

337
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,981
I'm OK. Just some asshole
with a knife grabbed my purse.

338
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,316
Oh, God.

339
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,451
Did you call the cops?

340
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,752
I didn't have to.

341
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:04,489
This dog was in the parking lot.

342
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,259
He chased the guy off, and then
he went and got my purse...

343
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,194
and brought it back for me.

344
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,097
Really?

345
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,565
He saved my life.

346
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,601
It was incredible.
You should've seen it.

347
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,403
He's a great guard dog.

348
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,907
No, no, no,
we are not keeping this dog.

349
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,943
That's like
a six-hundred-pound dog, Lori.

350
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,045
If he's that well-trained,
he's got to belong to somebody.

351
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,513
They're gonna want him back.

352
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,883
Maybe. L... I feel a lot safer
with him here...

353
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,885
after what happened to me
tonight.

354
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,888
Lori, you're always
doing this to me, you know?

355
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,056
You're always
bringing something home.

356
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,560
You brought home that parrot,
that foul-mouthed, messy parrot.

357
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,062
And this ugly painting and...

358
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,530
Honey.

359
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,132
It's just... the point is,
you don't ask me about it.

360
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,334
You know? I just come home,
and there's the stuff, right?

361
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,536
If you wanted a dog, you know...

362
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,704
you should have just
told me about it.

363
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,741
We'd go down, and we'd pick out
a nice dog, right?

364
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,244
Don't you think that would be
a better way to do it?

365
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,847
- Yeah, it could be, I guess.
- OK, good.

366
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,849
- But he's already here.
- No, Lori, No.

367
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,284
L... Why? I don't even know
what kind of home...

368
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,787
No dog! No dog!

369
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:09,955
Just try it with me!

370
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,014
If it doesn't work out,
we'll give him away.

371
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,268
If he stays,
he stays in the backyard.

372
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,463
I don't want him
running around the house loose.

373
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,201
It's cold out there.

374
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,045
Whatever you say, honey.

375
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,979
Thanks for being understanding.

376
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,088
The toughest part
of owning a restaurant...

377
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,522
is picking out the stupid menu.

378
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,060
What do you think of this?

379
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,462
Honey.

380
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,466
Oh, God!
What are you looking at?

381
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,834
That's disgusting.

382
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,402
How can you read that
before you go to bed?

383
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,670
You're going to get nightmares.

384
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,138
- Perry, I'm...
- I don't want you...

385
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,040
to get nightmares, sweetheart.

386
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,509
I want you to sleep real well.

387
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,012
I do. I want you to get
a good night's sleep.

388
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,809
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

389
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,617
Good, hmm?

390
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,567
Honey? I can't...

391
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,836
What? The dog's fine, really.

392
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,003
He's going to bark
the first night.

393
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,040
That's just natural.

394
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,378
I can't... I can't get into this
with him making all that noise.

395
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,180
I have to go check on him.
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,815
- OK.
- All right?

397
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,884
Fine.
Better go check on him.

398
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,452
He could be hurt or something.

399
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:52,224
- Who's going to hurt that dog?
- Fine.

400
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,657
Don't be too long, all right?

401
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,970
Ohh, you...

402
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,272
What are you
making so much noise for?

403
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:11,038
You miss me? You lonely
out there, huh? Huh, boy?

404
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,481
Come here, Max. Max.
Max, come here.

405
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,216
No, you can't go in.
No, you can't go in there.

406
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,344
No, you can't. You can't go in.

407
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,057
Lori!

408
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,287
All right, that's enough.
Out.

409
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,793
Max.

410
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,638
Oh, Max, go to hell, Max.

411
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,572
Get outside. Out.

412
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,401
Oh, give me a break.

413
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,411
You're bad.

414
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,151
OK.

415
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,221
OK, you can stay. OK.

416
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,522
But you have to be
really quiet...

417
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,217
because we don't want
mean old Perry finding out.

418
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,350
OK.

419
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:08,133
Hey, Lori,
are you coming up or what?

420
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,259
OK.

421
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,947
Honey?

422
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,116
Honey?

423
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,267
Are you asleep?

424
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,673
- So, what took you so long?
- I'm sorry.

425
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,375
- What was the matter with him?
- He's lonely.

426
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,345
Yeah, I know how he feels.

427
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,513
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,848
OK?

429
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,112
So, what did you do
to shut him up?

430
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,917
You know, I have a way with men.

431
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,250
You're such a liar.

432
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,968
Screw you, mutt!

433
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,375
Is that that dog
outside the door?

434
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,851
You let that dog
in the house, Lori.

435
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,486
I didn...

436
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,555
- He was crying out there.
- How could you do that?

437
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,524
I agreed to let you keep him,
didn't I?

438
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,259
The least you could do...

439
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,528
You got to meet me halfway
on this one, Lori.

440
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,894
OK. OK.

441
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,563
No, Max! No, Max!
No, Max! No, Max! No, Max!

442
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,273
- Get him out!
- Got to go, Max.

443
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,543
Come on, Max. Come on, Max.
We're going now.

444
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,679
Get him out, Lori! Out!

445
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,448
See what you did?
He's upset now.

446
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,279
Get him out, please.

447
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,494
Based on the descriptions
you gave us...

448
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,695
we have several suspects.

449
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,996
All of them have
prior arrests...

450
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,733
for illegal animal rights
activities and so forth.

451
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,036
So, what we want you to do
is take a look...

452
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,204
at a couple
of these pictures here.

453
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,505
Good. Thank you.

454
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,740
Hey, doc, have a seat.

455
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,367
I think we got something
for you here.

456
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,779
Can I have a glass of water?

457
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,940
These are our prime suspects.

458
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,575
Thank you.

459
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,915
I'm not sleeping too good.

460
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,734
Anything?

461
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,133
No.

462
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,563
Take your time.

463
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,442
No. Nothing.

464
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,472
What are we going to do now?

465
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,220
We're dusting for prints. I'm
waiting to hear from the lab.

466
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,723
No good. Came up empty.

467
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,792
You know,
we're on borrowed time, fellas.

468
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,226
All right, doc, look.

469
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,561
You're a little strung out.
You're tired.

470
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,730
Why don't you go home?
We'll round up a few suspects.

471
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,131
This bullshit
is not gonna do anything.

472
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:04,736
What we gotta do is go
out there and rescue my dog.

473
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,372
We're doing the best we can.

474
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,241
I'll tell you something.

475
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,812
I've given a dangerous
and experimental animal...

476
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,014
a neuropathic drug
to keep him stable...

477
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,817
to keep him calm.

478
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,921
When that drug wears off,
he is going to snap!

479
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,857
Hey, don't do that kind of shit
in here!

480
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,358
We're sitting on a time bomb...

481
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,928
and you're talking about going
out and dusting for prints!

482
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,429
Don't tell us how to do our job.

483
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,432
You don't get it, do you?
Max is fragmenting.

484
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,334
He's coming apart.

485
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,869
If I don't get him tonight...

486
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,772
he's going to go through
a psychotic episode.

487
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,832
You're the only fucking psycho
around here.

488
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,144
Hey, where you going?
We're not done.

489
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,010
We're not talking about
man's best friend here.

490
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,033
Sorry, pooch.

491
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,824
Oh, my God!

492
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,764
I'm sorry, OK? OK? I'm sorry!

493
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,563
Max!

494
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,734
Max! Come here, boy! Breakfast!

495
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,560
Hey, Mr. Ed.

496
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,997
Now, today's word is fartface.

497
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,699
Can you say fartface?

498
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,001
- Fartface. Fartface.
- Very good.

499
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,366
Yes!

500
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,506
- Hey, Lori.
- Rudy, how you doing?

501
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,008
I'm doing fine, but I'm
starving. What are you making?

502
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,245
Fruit and yogurt. Want some?

503
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,547
No, thanks. I'm allergic.

504
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,282
Well, go ahead.
Look in the fridge.

505
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,019
There's carrot sticks and
apples, some celery juice...

506
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,423
- Cool! Pizza!
- Some pizza.

507
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,392
- It's been in there a week.
- Yeah, just like at home.

508
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,490
Who's that?

509
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,737
- Wow! When did you get the dog?
- Yesterday.

510
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,239
Oh, man. This guy's
even bigger than my collie.

511
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,308
- What's his name?
- Max.

512
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,511
Hey, Max, want to come in?
Come on in.

513
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,448
Hey, don't let him get my pizza.

514
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,351
Come here. Come here.

515
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,152
He's not allowed in the house.

516
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,221
Can I bring him over
to my house to meet Heidi?

517
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,357
- Does that sound like fun?
- He's so cute.

518
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,359
All right. Hand me his leash.

519
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,850
All right. There you go.

520
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,999
- Keep your eye on him.
- I will. I will.

521
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,369
Be careful.
Bring him back in one piece.

522
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,438
- You don't trust me?
- No.

523
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,340
Rudy, close the gate
when you bring him back.

524
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,466
- OK?
- OK.

525
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,249
Oh, hi, doggie.

526
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,351
You want to help me
fix this thing?

527
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,481
You could go over and get that
brake line if you wanted to.

528
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,390
Whoa. Good boy, Max.

529
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,004
Hey, Heidi. Say hello to Max.

530
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,472
You like her, huh?

531
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,218
M-M-Max. Max!

532
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,820
Max! Shh!

533
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,151
You're going to wake up my dad!

534
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,924
Shut up, Max! Quiet!

535
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,593
Rudy, what the hell's
going on out here?

536
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,996
You know
I've been working all night.

537
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,999
It's nothing, dad. Max just
wanted to play with Heidi.

538
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,229
Doesn't want to play
with him, OK?

539
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,138
Now get him out of here
so I can get some rest.

540
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,840
OK.

541
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,467
Come on, Heidi.

542
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,603
Come on, Max. Let's go see Chet.

543
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,655
All right! Good noose.

544
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,714
Worthy of the SPCA.

545
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,690
Don't mess with the pros,
hairball.

546
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,656
Hey, chill, fleabag,
or I'll stun gun your bun.

547
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:03,960
We got him.

548
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,640
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,875
I wasn't gonna light it.

550
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,877
Go ahead. Kill yourself.

551
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,312
At your age and weight...

552
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,047
you're a perfect candidate
for a heart attack.

553
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,039
- I'm trying to quit, aren't I?
- Exactly.

554
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,954
I'm gonna put you
on a real fitness program.

555
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,922
You're worse than my wife.

556
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,191
In six months,
you won't recognize yourself.

557
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,993
Yeah, 'cause I'll be dead.

558
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,129
- What's this crap?
- Missing persons.

559
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,232
Gets a call from a guy
named Bill Sanders.

560
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,235
His wife Judy
doesn't come home last night.

561
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,634
Guess where she works?

562
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,006
Emax.

563
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,041
You're shitting me.

564
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,344
Pulled a photo off the computer.
Take a look.

565
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,580
Maybe we'd better have another
visit with the good doctor.

566
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,018
Judy Sanders only worked for me
for about three months.

567
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,020
I didn't really know her
very well.

568
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,523
Her husband says she left
for work that morning.

569
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,825
Well, she never arrived.
That's all I know.

570
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,227
What about my dog?

571
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,495
Any leads?

572
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,931
Keep your shirt on, doc.
We're on top of it.

573
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,966
We already fed the description
into the computer.

574
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,094
All units have been alerted,
including animal control.

575
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,606
I have to show you something.

576
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,913
Friday,
bring up the promo material.

577
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,676
One moment, please.

578
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,385
Voice activation.

579
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,987
You know,
when you think of guard dogs...

580
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,490
you usually think
of German shepherd.

581
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,460
They're loyal, smart, lethal,
but not good enough.

582
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,930
And now, with the development
of the Emax-3000...

583
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,400
they're totally obsolete.

584
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,038
You see, Max, as I call him,
is not your typical dog.

585
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,873
He's a genetic crossbreed.

586
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,308
A mutt.

587
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,444
I don't mean a mutt, sir.
Look around you.

588
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,013
Each of these animals
is endowed...

589
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,915
with a specific
desirable trait...

590
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,975
that is dedicated
to their survival.

591
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,156
If you took the DNA from each...

592
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,557
and genetically spliced it...

593
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,327
into the DNA
of a breed of a dog...

594
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,229
you would have
a magnificent creature.

595
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,464
You've actually been able
to do this?

596
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,900
Enhance sight, hearing...

597
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,471
strength, speed, stamina...

598
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,201
the ability to climb
with jaguarlike agility...

599
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,477
even a chameleonlike
capability...

600
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,747
to camouflage itself
if threatened.

601
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,350
Each of these traits
have been bred into Max.

602
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,619
His intelligence
is so advanced...

603
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,654
that he can operate
as a stand-alone unit...

604
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,322
without a human handler.

605
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:42,126
He can comprehend
almost 350 spoken commands.

606
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,195
Is that in English
or in Spanish?

607
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,031
You take your pick, detective.

608
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,268
What I am trying to tell you...

609
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,005
is that in the right hands,
Max can save thousands of lives.

610
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:58,676
In the wrong hands,
he can be a deadly weapon.

611
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:58,943
Boy, did my brother
cut one this morning.

612
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,113
Boy, did my brother
cut one this morning.

613
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,315
Grossed me right out
of the kitchen.

614
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,517
Sounds like it was
nuclear winter in there.

615
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,643
Ka-boom!

616
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,964
Look. There's Mrs. Barclay's
stupid cat Boo.

617
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,500
I hate that dumb cat.
He always tries to scratch me.

618
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,626
Me, too.

619
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,311
- Get him, Max!
- Sic 'im! Come on!

620
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,747
Go! Go, Max! Go! Get him!

621
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,084
Come on, Max! Get him!

622
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,053
Kick his ass! Come on!

623
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,681
- Yeah, get him!
- Come on!

624
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,685
Come on!

625
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,374
Wow.

626
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,378
You sicked him on that cat,
not me.

627
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,675
Oh, no, no, no. You did.

628
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,449
We better get out of here.
Mrs. Barclay will kill us!

629
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,251
Forget about it! We just got
to get out of here...

630
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,853
before he gets us, too!

631
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,688
- Oh, man!
- I told you not to!

632
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,990
- Shut up!
- That was your fault!

633
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,891
Shut up! Shut up!

634
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,498
- It's the brake lines.
- You're kidding.

635
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,999
Yeah, like, two hundred bucks.

636
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,269
- You got the checkbook?
- Yeah.

637
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,338
You got it on you?

638
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,464
Maybe.

639
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,509
Hey, listen...

640
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,279
why don't we finish
what we started last night, huh?

641
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,474
Because
I'm already late for work.

642
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,142
Come here.

643
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,525
Curtains are open.

644
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,117
So what? Nobody's watching.

645
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,060
Well, come around, idiot.

646
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,561
Come around!

647
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,142
You stupid mutt!

648
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,611
Put a lid on that dog, huh?

649
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,679
Hey, stop!

650
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,555
You stupid mutt!

651
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,038
No, no, no, Max.

652
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,940
Come on.

653
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,043
You have to...
Max, you have to stay. Max.

654
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,045
Go on. You have to stay.

655
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,047
Good boy.
I'll be back in a little while.

656
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,049
I just have to go to work.
It's OK.

657
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,017
I have a deadline to meet.

658
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,952
Max.

659
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,932
Don't do this to me, Max.

660
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,934
You stay.

661
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,630
Do what dogs do...
guard the house. You know.

662
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,826
Come on, we got to go.

663
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,929
- Dad...
- I don't want to be late.

664
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,463
Come on.

665
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,829
Come on, Heidi. You have
to stay at home. Come on.

666
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,905
You don't want to miss the game,
do you?

667
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,408
OK, I'm coming.

668
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,542
You locked the front door,
didn't you?

669
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,278
- You think I'd forget?
- All right.

670
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,404
Let's go.

671
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,538
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

672
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,438
Come here, boo!

673
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,716
Let's get to work.

674
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,251
See how this tape turned out.

675
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,987
I need a cappuccino.
You want one?

676
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,490
Can we just get into this,
please?

677
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,692
So, how was Max last night?

678
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,495
He was a pain in the ass...

679
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,331
but he's got such a personality.

680
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,434
- How did Perry handle it?
- Oh, he loves Max.

681
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,404
Right. You didn't tell him
where you got that dog, did you?

682
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,530
He'll see it on the news.

683
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:41,278
I think something's gnawed
through your brake line somehow.

684
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,015
I had my brake lines changed
just this morning.

685
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,983
See for yourself, huh?

686
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,488
Oh, Jesus.

687
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,761
Oh, God.
He's trying to kill me.

688
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:01,060
- Who's trying to kill you?
- My girlfriend's dog.

689
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,468
Yeah, right.

690
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,935
I like that.

691
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,269
- Yo, Frank, over here.
- What do we got, Dan?

692
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,238
One of the box boys found
a body behind the dumpster.

693
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,507
It's pretty bad.

694
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,008
Fits the description
of the mugger...

695
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,510
that's been terrorizing
the mall.

696
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,113
Jesus Christ!

697
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:52,014
Get ahold of Jarret.
I want him to look at this.

698
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,146
You won't be mugging
anybody no more, pal.

699
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:03,460
The lacerations, the power,
the efficiency...

700
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,329
yes, it was Max.

701
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,464
Put this bastard
out of business.

702
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,699
Put him out of business?

703
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,134
He killed him,
for Christ's sake.

704
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,770
That's what
he was designed to do, sir.

705
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,471
What is the matter, detective?

706
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,007
You upset that Max
did your job for you?

707
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:19,243
- Want to see me do my job?
- Yeah, do your job.

708
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,812
I'll do my job, all right.
Emilio, get on the blower...

709
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,514
and tell every black and white
in San Remo...

710
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,049
that if they find
this... this canine...

711
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,852
to blow its friggin' head off!

712
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,989
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, detective.

713
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,358
I don't think this city
could survive...

714
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,728
a multimillion dollar lawsuit
'cause you went off half-cocked.

715
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,165
Half-cocked? Somebody died here.

716
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,968
This was a predator
who preyed on innocent people.

717
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,071
People have to cower
in their homes...

718
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,007
because you two are
standing around bullshitting.

719
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,542
Eat shit.

720
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,477
Max doesn't deserve a bullet.
He deserves a medal.

721
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:01,385
Friday, what is the maximum
amount of time left...

722
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,954
before Max becomes
completely destabilized?

723
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,922
One moment, please.

724
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:14,464
5 hours, 29 minutes,
and 14 seconds.

725
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,066
And the minimum?

726
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,001
The minimum time
has already expired.

727
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,859
Hi there, buddy.

728
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,394
Hey, big fella.

729
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,198
Easy now, boy. Easy, easy.

730
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:52,703
Take it easy now.
Don't be stupid.

731
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,438
You must be new
in the neighborhood.

732
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,201
I think it's time we met.

733
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,507
Try something,
you son of a bitch.

734
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,350
Dr. Jarret?

735
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,927
I found something.

736
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,667
Hey, Glen, you got
any blank tape I can steal?

737
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,485
- Hurry.
- I'm trying.

738
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,611
Go!

739
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,155
Jesus!

740
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,092
- We're in big trouble.
- Why?

741
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,028
I just saw Dr. Jarret out front.

742
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,764
Hi, Lori. This is Deborah
at the front desk.

743
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,198
Yeah. I've got a Dr. Jarret
here to see you.

744
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,631
Sure.

745
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,199
I'm sorry, sir. Miss Tanner's
not available right now.

746
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:18,115
Hey, look,
it's urgent that I talk to her.

747
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,140
Sir, please step outside.

748
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,020
Where are you going?

749
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,522
I just... I got to do something
with Max.

750
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,890
What are you gonna do with him?

751
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,693
I don't know! Hide him.
Put him in a kennel somewhere.

752
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,529
Lori, that's probably the first
place he'll go looking for him.

753
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,965
You just have to give him away
to somebody.

754
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,968
- Who?
- I don't know. Check the paper.

755
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,835
There's got to be somebody
looking for a great guard dog.

756
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,544
Sir, please leave the building
peacefully...

757
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,112
or I'm going to have
to call security.

758
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,647
What?

759
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,115
- Don't make me do this.
- Wait a second.

760
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,583
- Come on, listen.
- Don't do that.

761
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,751
Please, sir, leave the building.

762
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,253
She is not available
to talk to you right now.

763
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,722
- Call her back...
- Ray!

764
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,849
Excuse me, sir. You're going
to have to step outside.

765
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,498
Get the hell out of here.

766
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,695
- Come on, let's go, let's go.
- OK, OK.

767
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,861
Jerk.

768
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,291
Hey, Lori!

769
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,595
Hello, fartface!

770
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,146
Max?

771
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,959
Oh, Max!

772
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,162
I got something for you, Max.

773
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,493
Lunchtime!

774
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,635
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

775
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,037
Look what I got for you, huh?
Look at that.

776
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,840
Some nice steak tartare
from the restaurant.

777
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,576
It's all for you, buddy, OK?
Good boy.

778
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,045
Go ahead. Eat up, boy.
That's it.

779
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,105
I made that special for you,
all right?

780
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,654
Go on, Max. Eat up, buddy.

781
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,519
It's good. Yum yum yum.

782
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,683
Eat the food, Max.

783
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,390
Hey, fleabag! Muttonhead!

784
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,413
Max!

785
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,091
Max.

786
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,892
Hi, Max.

787
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,661
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

788
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,329
We got to go for a ride.
That's a good boy.

789
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,230
Come on. Come on.
Good boy. Come on.

790
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,259
Oh, good boy.

791
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,274
OK, stop stuffing your face
for one minute.

792
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,676
I got news.

793
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:43,280
I think Dr. Jarret's psychotic
superdog killed Judy Sanders...

794
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,181
the girl who disappeared
from Emax.

795
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,349
Check this out.

796
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:50,353
He got his Ph.D. From Berkeley
at twenty.

797
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,322
By the time
he was twenty-eight...

798
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,858
he was patenting
this new synthetic hormone.

799
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,960
Made him a multimillionaire
overnight.

800
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,496
All right, he's got
a wonderful resume. What else?

801
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,232
Here's where the story
gets interesting.

802
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,334
About six years ago,
Jarret gets busted...

803
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,903
experimenting
on endangered species.

804
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,705
His investors pulled out...

805
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,540
and he's rejected
by the scientific community.

806
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,809
He has a nervous breakdown.

807
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,977
About a year later...

808
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,714
he gets out of the hospital,
takes Emax private...

809
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,483
and starts breeding
these friggin' guard dogs.

810
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,187
He's got everything he has
riding on their success.

811
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,556
He'd do anything
to protect that animal.

812
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,559
I say we get a warrant,
go to Emax.

813
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,429
I bet we find the body.

814
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,556
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

815
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,754
- See the scars?
- Yeah.

816
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,552
Get them.
Go all the way up and down.

817
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,130
- Do you have us both in frame?
- Yeah. Why?

818
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,499
I want to do
the intro to the story.

819
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,267
Are you crazy?
We can do that later.

820
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:47,003
No. It's perfect. Now, now.

821
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,838
Do I look OK?

822
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,039
You look beautiful. Just hurry.

823
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,836
Dog slobber.

824
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,489
- Lori?
- Ray?

825
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,391
Come here, boy.

826
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:11,428
Come on,
I'm not going to hurt you.

827
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,863
How are we going
to become friends...

828
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,031
if you're going
to act like that?

829
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,668
I've got a nice piece
of rawhide for you.

830
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,870
You know you want that.

831
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,706
Come get it. Come get it.

832
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,375
You're a big dog.

833
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,610
Handsome, too, aren't you?

834
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,480
I bet you get
all the girls. Huh?

835
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,573
Hey, you want some more?

836
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,489
Boy, I sure would like
to have him around.

837
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:42,492
So, where would Max live,
exactly?

838
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:45,862
Well, not here, that's for sure.

839
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,464
OK.

840
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,668
No, I got a big ranch of about
15 acres out in Shadow Hills.

841
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,870
My dog Wayne
used to love it out there.

842
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,371
That sounds great.

843
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,774
There's plenty of room
to run around in...

844
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,641
rabbits to chase,
creeks to swim in.

845
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,582
Dog's got a good life
if he's with me.

846
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:08,346
I need to know I can have him
back if things change.

847
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,287
This isn't easy.

848
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:12,755
Oh, he'll be all right.

849
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,958
Just give him a couple of days
up at the ranch...

850
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,255
he won't even remember you.

851
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,802
I'm sorry, Max.

852
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,103
I have to do this.

853
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,037
Otherwise, they're going
to take you back to the lab.

854
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,742
Remember I promised
I would take care of you? Huh?

855
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,716
Besides,
Ray's going to look after you.

856
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:43,686
- Isn't that right, Ray?
- That sure is right.

857
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,355
We're gonna have
a great time together.

858
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,879
Aren't we, Max?

859
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,752
OK, Max, you be good.

860
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,932
Stay with Ray now, OK?

861
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,456
I'll be back for you.

862
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,798
You'll be fine, boy.

863
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,306
Easy, boy, easy.

864
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,344
That's enough of that.

865
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,492
Settle down, boy.

866
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,791
She dumped you,
just like they all do.

867
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,503
I said settle down,
you worthless piece of dog shit.

868
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,370
I asked you nice, didn't I?

869
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,512
- Hello.
- Lori?

870
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,714
Look, I don't know if you're
gonna believe this or not...

871
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,749
but I think your dog
tried to kill me today.

872
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,251
What are you talking about?

873
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,120
Well, he gnawed
through my brake lines...

874
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,456
and I almost crashed
going down the highway.

875
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,991
That's crazy, Perry.

876
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,794
Oh, I know it's crazy, but
I swear to God it's true, Lori.

877
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,463
And then when I finally
got home, he attacked me.

878
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,965
The dog's got to go.

879
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,500
- He's gone, OK?
- What?

880
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,230
- I just gave him away.
- Lor-Lori...

881
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,487
What's the matter, boy?
Don't you like my ranch?

882
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,230
Living
at the end of that chain...

883
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,425
is gonna make you the meanest
junkyard dog in the city.

884
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,568
Shut up!

885
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,137
You going to shut up or not?

886
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,425
OK, you asked for it.

887
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,594
Now you're going to get it.

888
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,764
Come on, boy. Come on, Max.

889
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:11,267
Come on, Max. Now you're
going to be a hot dog.

890
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,794
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
I'm going to burn your ass bad.

891
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,841
Get off me! Get...

892
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,033
Look, I'm telling you...

893
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,736
Dr. Jarret just ran out
a little while ago.

894
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,305
I mean, he told us
to pack everything up.

895
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:53,142
I'm sure when Dr. Jarret gets
back, he'll explain everything.

896
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,144
Do you know a woman
named Judy Sanders...

897
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,213
one of the ladies
who used to work here?

898
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,381
Not really.

899
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,417
I mean, I said hello to her
a couple times in the hallway.

900
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,585
Why?

901
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:06,155
We think Judy is dead,
and Dr. Jarret is responsible.

902
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,757
What?

903
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,554
Tell us where he went.

904
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,062
Yeah, I think we got it, Doug.

905
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,931
All right. That's good.

906
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,366
You know, I'd like to take
about a five-minute break.

907
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:18,492
Yeah, that's good.

908
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:23,039
Hey, pan down the row.

909
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,674
Remember me?

910
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,043
Where's my dog?

911
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,479
Hey, man, it wasn't my idea.

912
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,047
You got to talk to Lori.

913
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,446
Where's Lori?

914
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:13,588
Max?

915
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:22,597
Oh, my God.

916
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,804
Where did you come from?

917
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,173
I got him for you.

918
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,340
Do you like him?

919
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,433
What? I...

920
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,146
I can't believe you did this.

921
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,515
Yeah. I know.
Me, neither, really.

922
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,751
But I was feeling kind of bad...

923
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,015
you know, 'cause I know
how much you miss Max.

924
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,856
And also I figured
now was my chance...

925
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,225
to get a dog in here
that I liked, too...

926
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:53,296
before you brought home
another monster.

927
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,898
- He's cute.
- Mm-hmm. What is he?

928
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,867
I don't know.
The lady at the pet shop...

929
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,169
she swore to me he wasn't gonna
get much bigger than this.

930
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,372
So he's a little dog.
That's what he is.

931
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:07,009
Looks like
he should be a Barney or...

932
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,212
No. Spike.
I've been calling him Spike.

933
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,513
- He likes it.
- Spike?

934
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,948
Yeah. He acts like a Spike.
Watch this.

935
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,316
This is his favorite thing,
this plug.

936
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,717
Go get it, Spike. Go get it.

937
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,486
Honey, that's not... that's not...
that's dangerous.

938
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,355
OK.

939
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,590
It's very sweet of you.

940
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

941
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,557
- I love you, Lori.
- I know.

942
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,267
Thanks for getting rid of Max
for me, honey.

943
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:34,203
I really didn't like him
very much.

944
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:37,172
I got to go to work, honey.
I'm late.

945
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,742
Spike. No, no.

946
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,510
Don't play with that.

947
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,679
- Lori?
- Rudy.

948
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,544
Meet Spike.

949
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,468
Where's Max?

950
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:42,733
Uh, Max's owner
decided to take him back.

951
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,007
You're lucky.

952
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,943
What do you mean?

953
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,377
Uh, nothing.

954
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,470
I'm going to make
a milk shake, OK?

955
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,654
Voila. Stir.

956
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:18,741
Um, look, just take it easy,
OK, Max? Just take it easy.

957
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:22,545
Max. Look, everything's OK,
buddy. Take it easy now.

958
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,448
Look, you went after me first,
Max, and I went after you...

959
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,417
so we can just call it even
then, OK? And we can be friends.

960
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,250
Max. Max.

961
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,179
Oh, damn.

962
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:12,895
Perry!

963
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:15,022
Oh, God. Max.

964
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,833
Max, no! No!

965
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,980
Oh. Rudy, Rudy.

966
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,141
- Open up! Let us in!
- Max!

967
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,884
- Freeze!
- There he is!

968
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,019
Stay down!

969
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,833
Let's go! Let's get this mutt!

970
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,510
Right over there.
Come on. Come on.

971
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,245
Let's go, Emilio!

972
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,815
Get in there, you wimp.

973
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,884
All units, all units.
We have a 1091-A.

974
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,119
Vicious dog,
pursuit in progress.

975
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,287
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on.

976
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,722
We got to get in on this.

977
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,247
Any available units,
please respond.

978
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,262
Come on, let's go! Floor it!

979
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:37,780
He's turning right
on Albuquerque. Adam 361.

980
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,882
Split off.
We'll try to box him in.

981
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:41,281
You got it. We're in pursuit.

982
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:46,122
He's turning on Montecito!
Don't lose him!

983
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,723
Rank amateurs.

984
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,122
Uh, roger that.

985
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,357
Close in on him! Now!

986
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,462
We got him, we got him.

987
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,106
Ram him! Run him over!

988
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,685
He's ours now.

989
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,085
Move over, rover,
so the pros can take over.

990
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,938
You ready for some action?

991
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,073
Cocked and loaded,
armed and dangerous, baby.

992
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,201
All right, let's bag this puppy.

993
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,944
I've got a weird feeling
about this.

994
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:55,582
Come on, man.

995
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,795
Here, puppy.

996
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,057
Good doggy.

997
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,025
Here, puppy.

998
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,256
- Go! Go! Go!
- I'm going! I'm going! OK!

999
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,416
What was that?

1000
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,472
What's going on?

1001
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,541
- Stay back, folks.
- You folks stay back.

1002
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,509
Stay clear of the area, please.

1003
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,848
OK, ma'am, to the side.
Just stay back there, please.

1004
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:56,819
I heard there was some kind of
wild animal that got in there.

1005
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,083
OK, people, let's go home.
Show's over.

1006
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:04,391
They tell me
he's going to be OK.

1007
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,425
We'd like to ask you
some questions inside.

1008
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,903
I'll be in here, Emilio.

1009
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,180
Where do you think
you're going?

1010
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,850
There's nothing you can do
for your boyfriend now.

1011
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,852
I have to go to the hospital
to be with Perry.

1012
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:32,187
Hey, the way I look at it,
you only got two choices.

1013
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,456
One... you walk out that door,
and we arrest you.

1014
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,225
Two... you stay here
and help us catch...

1015
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,294
this friggin' psycho mutt.

1016
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,629
'Cause I got a hunch
he's coming back here.

1017
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,632
I'll do whatever I can to help.
I'm sorry.

1018
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,501
All right, all right, all right.
Sit tight.

1019
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,991
We'll take care of everything.

1020
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:10,192
It's, uh...
all clear out here, Frankie.

1021
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,195
OK, Emilio. Let me know
if you see anything.

1022
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,355
10-4.

1023
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,491
- We'll call you if we need you.
- OK.

1024
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,580
It's going to be OK, Spike.

1025
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,571
Everything's
going to be all right.

1026
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,306
Get in!

1027
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,232
Let me out!

1028
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:40,035
I just need you long enough
to get Max to follow us to Emax.

1029
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,538
- Then you can go to hell.
- Stop the car!

1030
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,306
Stop it!

1031
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,740
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1032
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,615
Why didn't you leave me alone?

1033
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:54,917
What about those animals
at your lab?

1034
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,318
What about
what you're doing to them?

1035
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,154
They mean nothing.
The project is what's important.

1036
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,622
Don't you understand that?

1037
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,724
- No. I can't.
- Gimme that.

1038
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:06,461
You broke the bond with Max.

1039
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,895
If I don't sedate him,
he's going to turn on you...

1040
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,493
just like he did on me.

1041
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,929
Max! Max!

1042
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:44,600
Release! Max! Release!

1043
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,368
Release!

1044
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,029
Max!

1045
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,398
Spike, come here.

1046
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,250
No!

1047
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,851
Get out.

1048
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,182
He'll kill you.

1049
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,986
Max.

1050
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,813
Spike!

1051
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,115
Max.

1052
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:39,054
Get away from my dog.

1053
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,827
Get away from him!

1054
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,031
No!

1055
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,042
Lori! Come here! You got
to come see this! Come on!

1056
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,411
OK. Come on, Spike.

1057
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,646
Let's say hi to Rudy.

1058
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:05,947
Come on.

1059
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,148
You won't believe this.
Come on.

1060
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,250
What?

1061
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,752
Surprise.

1062
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:13,755
Oh, no! Look at them!

1063
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:17,492
- Aren't they cute?
- Oh, come here.

1064
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,761
Hey, you want one?
You want one?

1065
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,321
Oh, look. Spike's jealous.
