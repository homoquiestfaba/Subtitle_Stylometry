I'd like you to meet Reverend Young.

180
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,588
Oh, hi. You must be Lauren.
I've heard so much about you.

181
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,655
Nice to meet you.

182
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,991
So, Olivia tells me you're
with the student paper.

183
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,660
I was just hoping, you know, to get a feel

184
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,594
for what the whole
youth group is all about.

185
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,262
Yeah, sure, have a seat.

186
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:48,165
We were just going over tonight's agenda.

187
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,200
Great. You don't mind if I...

188
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:53,603
Oh, no, of course not.

189
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,104
So have you met everyone here?

190
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:58,141
- Yeah. Hey, again, everyone.
- Hi.

191
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,410
Great. Let's get started.

192
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,713
So this summer, I stayed with a host family

193
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:07,383
on a farm in Porto Cortez
for about 4 1/2 weeks.

194
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:11,322
That is why I've decided after
college to take a year off

195
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:15,391
and go back to Honduras on a youth mission.

196
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:16,993
It's one way that I know that I can

197
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,695
truly make a difference in the eyes of God.

198
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,198
- That is so wonderful.
- Thank you.

199
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,102
Lauren, do you have a story
of faith you'd like to share?

200
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,137
Oh, um...

201
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,573
maybe next time.

202
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,041
- Lauren used to be a member.
- Oh, really?

203
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:34,410
Yeah. It was a really long time ago.

204
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,612
Well, you know the door's always open here.

205
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:41,385
All you have to do is
decide to walk through it.

206
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:45,021
Thanks again for letting me
be a fly on the wall tonight.

207
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,423
I don't really know what
there is to write about.

208
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,359
We're a pretty boring group.

209
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,997
Boring? With all of your youth
missions and volunteering?

210
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,265
I'm really glad I came.

211
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:58,368
I think it's good for people to
see a different side of things.

212
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,204
Hey, there's a party at
Kendall's house tomorrow night

213
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,506
if you're not busy.

214
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,674
I don't think I've spoken to Kendall

215
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,309
since like the second grade.

216
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,045
Well, she's my friend, so
if I invite you, it's cool.

217
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:10,780
You can bring your boyfriend, uh...

218
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,583
- Brad?
- Yeah.

219
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:17,087
Actually, things aren't going so
well with Brad and me right now.

220
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,554
Well, in that case,

221
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:21,091
maybe it'll help you
get your mind off things?

222
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,193
Maybe.

223
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,194
I should go. Thanks again.

224
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,431
Yeah.

225
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,637
My phone.

No! No!

233
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,612
No!

[whimpering]

235
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,353
No!

236
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,626
I sought the Lord,

237
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:39,228
and He answered me, and He
delivered me from all my fears.

238
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,697
[screams]

239
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,665
If you believe in Him

240
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,599
and all of His heavenly host,

241
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,234
the demons that are tormenting your body

242
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,371
will be cast out and
will plague you no more!

[screaming continues]

245
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,032
Late night, huh?

246
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,202
Apparently those church
kids know how to live it up

247
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,369
on a Friday night.

248
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,506
Hmm.

249
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:24,977
Well, how'd it go?

250
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,944
Um, fine.

251
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,947
Oh, no. We're not back to that
monosyllabic 14-year-old Lauren,

252
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,617
are we?

253
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,620
I thought it was interesting
and informative. Better?

254
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,790
Was that so hard?

255
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,261
So you ever think about,
you know, going back?

256
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,664
To church?

257
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,600
It's been a long time.

258
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,403
Those youth group kids
convert you last night?

259
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,838
No. I was just wondering.

260
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,839
I don't know.

261
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:59,009
Church was always more of your dad's thing.

262
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,482
After he died, you seemed to lose interest.

263
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,885
So do you have any plans for today?

264
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,421
Umm, I thought I'd go by the school paper.

265
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,423
You realize it's a Saturday, right?

266
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,592
I just, I want to catch up on my article.

267
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,561
Don't work too hard.

268
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,500
Okay.

Did you sit around and
drink orange Kool-Aid

295
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,528
and sing "Jesus Loves Me?"

Well, uh, drink up.

No-jito.

Well, it's my specialty.

308
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:17,166
Oh, being a virgin or making no-jitos?

- Ohh!
- Ouch!

get your head out of the sand

I'm gonna go break some commandments,

Hey, you made it.

338
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:22,031
I made it.

00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,099
Not really my style,

340
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:27,473
but here I am, seeing
how the other 99.9% sins.

341
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:29,873
That was a joke.

Oh, yeah. Totally.

343
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,711
Um, well, let me show you around.

344
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,182
- Yeah.
- Come on.

345
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,857
Oh, hey, guys. How'd
the rest of the game go?

just say the word.

that information is privileged.

Okay, well, have fun.

490
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,452
One day, a shepherd took
his flock, 100 sheep,

491
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,722
away from the village
and into the wilderness.

492
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,723
As they made the journey,

493
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,857
one of the sheep wandered off and got lost.

494
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,694
Now, the shepherd could
have stayed with his flock

495
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,562
and let the animal go,

496
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,264
but he didn't.

497
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,633
He left his flock unattended,

498
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:27,336
and he went alone to
look for the lost sheep.

499
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,771
And when he finally found
it, and he returned home,

500
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,308
he called together his
friends and neighbors,

501
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,777
and he said, "Rejoice with me,

502
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,614
for I have found my sheep, which was lost."

503
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,883
Now think about that.

504
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,287
The shepherd was far happier
finding that one sheep

505
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:48,456
than the other 99 that didn't wander off.

506
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:50,492
So the important lesson behind this parable

507
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:54,230
is that we're only as strong
as the weakest among us.

508
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,830
And if we don't do all we can

509
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:58,867
to help the lost sheep in our lives,

510
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:01,904
we're failing the entire flock.

511
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,540
So as you go back to your
regular life this week,

512
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,944
remember each one of us,
in the eyes of the Lord,

513
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:09,945
is a shepherd.

514
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:14,217
And our challenge is to
always be on the lookout

515
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,388
for any sheep that might need
a little help getting back home.

Not good.

what happened at the party.

No. I wish I did.

544

It just seems like
everything's been going downhill

545
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,844

I saw what happened at the church,

568

we could just talk about it.

Why?

570
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:02,170
I was just wondering.

572
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,275
Did it help?

573
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,277
A month ago, my life was out of control.

574
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,780
I was drinking, doing drugs, cutting.

575
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:14,683
I felt like I'd lost
control of my own life,

576
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,286
like I was trapped on
the outside, watching.

577
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:22,224
I'd been to shrinks, counselors, hospitals.

578
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,960
I'd taken every crazy pill.

579
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,963
I came very close to taking my own life.

00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:30,165
Finally a nurse at the hospital

581
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,636
told my mom about Reverend Young.

00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,137
Do you need anything?

583
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,172
But when you found out about
what he did, didn't it sound...

584
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,842
Crazy? Of course it did.

585
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,679
And I fought it for a long
time, but I was desperate.

586
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,181
Then I had to take all kinds of tests

587
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,583
before Reverend Young
would even agree to help me.

588

00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:44,366
Intelligence, emotional development...

714
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:48,103
Dr. Phillips, there's something
wrong with my daughter.

715
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,570
Well, unfortunately she's off the charts

716
00:46:49,572 --> 00:46:52,340
in the more negative areas as well.

717
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:56,610
Isolation, regression,
emotional detachment.

718
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,380
It's possible that we
could be talking about

719
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,748
some form of paranoid schizophrenia.

720
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,384
What you mean, possible?

721
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,652
Well, it's not easy to diagnose.

722
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:07,688
The symptoms often mimic
various other illnesses

723
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,025
that are mental and physical.

724
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,460
Bipolar depression. It's just
gonna take some time for me

725
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,628
to have a definite answer.

726
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,165
[sighs] Great.

727
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:21,302
You should know that the
symptoms often are very similar

728
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:26,440
to the effects of certain... substances.

729
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:29,177
- My daughter's not using drugs.
- That you know of.

730
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,480
No. No!

731
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:35,050
<i>They know you're a waste of space.</i>

732
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,619
Don't you dare tell me
I don't know my daughter!

733
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,788
You're the third professional
I've taken my daughter to.

734
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,757
<i>There's nothing you can do about it.</i>

735
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:44,092
<i>You're a wicked person.</i>

736
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:47,061
I'm gonna take these test
results to my colleagues,

737
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:48,663
and I'm confident, with some consultation,

738
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,935
we'll come up with a
treatment plan for Chloe.

739
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:58,608
I want her to start taking this.

740
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:03,110
Thorazine?

741
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:05,047
It may help alleviate some of the symptoms,

742
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,614
give you some peace of mind.

743
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:08,952
I know what these pills do to people.

744
00:48:12,288 --> 00:48:14,425
There might be another option.

745
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,126
You might want to
consider a civil commitment

746
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:22,197
to a care facility.

747
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,736
No. I will not have my
little girl committed.

748
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:34,342
Okay. What did you get for number 16?

749
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,677
Hold on. There's no 16.

750
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,280
- Hmm...
- Stop!

751
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:41,483
- Just making sure you're awake.
- I'm awake, okay?

752
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,518
There's just something
about studying in a bed.

753
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,487
I mean, I guess I shouldn't be complaining.

754
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:49,391
I'm in bed with a hot, intelligent girl.

755
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,492
- Woman.
- Woman.

756
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,531
And technically you are
on the bed, not in it.

757
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,866
And I'm worried about calculus.

758
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,302
I think I may need to have
to turn in my man card.

759
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:03,572
Okay, hold on, I've
always wondered about this.

760
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,507
Where do you turn in your man card?

761
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,675
Is there like a man card store?

762
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:10,744
No to mention, returning it
after 17 years seems problematic.

763
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:12,880
Well, you're the investigative reporter,

764
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,586
so you figure it out.

765
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,286
Hey, can I ask you something?

766
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,523
Well, uh, depends on whether or not

767
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,694
it'll lead to something
totally humiliating.

768
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,331
You've seen Chloe lately, right?

769
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:35,270
Yes, the troubled young lady.

770
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,404
Yeah, I just can't help but feel like

771
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,676
there's something more I
should be doing to help her.

772
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:52,219
Well, you just keep being her friend.

773
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:56,757
I've tried that, but
it's clearly not enough.

774
00:49:56,759 --> 00:50:00,895
You know, some people just
need to work their junk out.

775
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,230
It's like sweating out a fever.

776
00:50:03,232 --> 00:50:05,068
I just feel totally helpless.

777
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:37,600
My older brother Randall was, uh...

778
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:42,570
a serious eff-up a few years back.

779
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,905
I mean, we tried everything.

780
00:50:44,907 --> 00:50:48,342
My parents were just ready to give up.

781
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:51,478
Then...

782
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,418
Then one day he grew up.
You know, got it together.

783
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,688
It was... it was like a switch flipped.

784
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,827
Look, you have to live your life, not hers.

785
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,732
Why are you so nice to me?

786
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:18,239
Look, you and I have been
friends for a long time,

787
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,907
and we've know each other for even longer.

788
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,643
No, I-I-I'm
sorry.

789
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,515
I didn't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable.

790
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,019
Lauren, I've...

791
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,288
I've been in love with
you since freshman year.

792
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,759
Since we were the same height,
and I still had braces on.

793
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:42,364
Yeah, I know I should have
said something a long time ago.

794
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:45,102
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't
have said something now, but...

795
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:57,814
<i>[voices muttering]</i>

796
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,857
<i>[voices cackling]</i>

797
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,727
Whew!

798
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,962
That was pretty Ryan Gosling of me, huh?

799
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:17,799
Okay, don't flatter yourself.
You are no Ryan Gosling.

800
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,567
Ah, ah...

801
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:22,570
Ryan Gosling is no Mase Adkins.

802
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,709
- Oh, really? Is that the case?
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,648
Chloe, Chloe...

804
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,351
You want him. You want him.

805
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,619
- Chloe, what happened?
- You're gonna leave me for him.

806
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:40,387
- You're leaving me for him!
- No, I'm not!

807
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,058
You're leaving me! You're
leaving me, you liar!

808
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,393
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Chloe!

809
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:48,531
Chloe. Chloe, it's okay.

810
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:54,001
No. No, please, don't hurt me!

811
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:56,471
- No one's gonna hurt you. Are we Mase?
- No, no, of course not.

812
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,172
You see?

813
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,605
- Yes, you are.
- No, Chloe.

814
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,775
You are. They said you would.

815
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,578
Who said that?

816
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,445
Chloe.

817
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,846
Chloe?

818
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,482
What's going on?

819
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,616
I just want to be normal again.

820
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:12,020
I don't know what's happening to me.

821
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,021
Listen, listen, we're gonna
get you healthy again, okay?

822
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:17,592
- Just get them out of my head.
- It's okay.

823
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,628
It's okay. Shh...

824
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,098
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

825
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,532
It's okay, Chloe.

826
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:27,905
[crying]

827
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:49,891
She's finally asleep.

828
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,761
I'm doing everything I can.

829
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,962
Specialists, every expert online

830
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:58,532
who knows anything
about how the mind works.

831
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:02,570
I'm terrified I'm gonna wake up and...

832
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,672
find I've lost her forever.

833
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:08,710
As if like the next time I talk to her,

834
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:15,483
she'll be so far gone in this
abyss that she won't come back.

835
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,289
Sometimes I see life and
recognition in her eyes.

836
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:24,694
I get a glimpse of my little girl.

837
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:31,268
I can't lose her. I won't.

838
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:36,503
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Mitchell.

839
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:39,007
It seemed to to start after David left.

840
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:42,444
I can't help thinking that
she blames herself or me.

841
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,779
It can't be easy going through this.

842
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:50,451
It's not your fault. It's nobody's fault.

843
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,520
What's going on with
Chloe, I can't explain it,

844
00:54:53,522 --> 00:54:57,692
but it's like I'm looking into her eyes,

845
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,561
and there's someone else looking back,

846
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,929
someone I don't recognize.

847
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,532
I can't help thinking there's
something else I can do,

848
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,902
something that I haven't done.

849
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,841
I would do anything to help her. Anything.

850
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:15,178
I'm sure we'll think of something.

851
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:18,512
Make them stop!

852
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:20,181
- God bless you.
- [screaming]

853
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,885
[gasp]

854
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,931
- Hey.
- Hi.

855
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:10,864
Mind if I sit?

856
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,699
Sure.

857
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,838
How's Chloe doing?

858
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,641
Should I lie and say she's fine?

859
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:20,608
No.

860
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,143
It's bad.

861
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,779
Actually, it's worse than bad.

862
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,748
I feel like we're really
starting to lose her,

863
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,150
which is why I'm here.

864
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,554
I was hoping that maybe
you could help in some way.

865
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,688
I don't know how I-

866
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,590
I saw what happened at the
church last Friday night.

867
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:39,126
You mean the youth group meeting?

868
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:40,229
I mean after.

869
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,630
I don't know what you're talking...

870
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:45,900
I saw it.

871
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,703
I left my phone behind,
and when I went to get it,

872
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:53,477
I saw what happened in the
basement with Emma Walters.

873
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,913
You even got a name?

874
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:01,715
You're a regular Woodward and Bernstein.

875
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:02,951
I talked to her.

876
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,018
- What?
- I found out where she worked,

877
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,087
and I went to talk to
her about what happened.

878
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:10,224
She said it helped. She
said she feels better.

879
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,960
If you wanted to know anything,
you could've come to me.

880
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:13,661
You could've asked.

881
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:16,199
I wanted an objective opinion.

882
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,768
I'm a pretty smart girl.

883
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,070
31 on my ACTs, National Honor Society,

884
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,840
early acceptance to Notre Dame.

885
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,842
I'm not some Flat Earth zealot

886
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,844
who believes that dinosaurs
were on Noah's Ark.

887
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,117
- And neither is Reverend Young.
- I know.

888
00:57:36,118 --> 00:57:37,954
So what did you have in mind?

889
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:42,924
I was thinking that maybe if we
just talked to Reverend Young,

890
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,625
explain what's going on with Chloe,

891
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:49,130
then maybe he could
help her in the same way.

892
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,898
You know he's very careful about
who he shares this stuff with.

893
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,201
Her mom has tried everything else.

894
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:57,473
Please. She needs your help.

895
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,916
Uh, Reverend Young?

896
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:12,920
Olivia, Lauren. You gave me a little scare.

897
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,989
Is this a bad time? We saw the lights on.

898
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,891
I was just closing up for the night.

899
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,960
What brings you by so late?

900
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,895
Well, first of all,

901
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:24,032
that exorcism you did last
week was amazing. Incredible.

902
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,866
Olivia...

903
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:27,034
Oh, no, no, it's okay. Lauren's a friend.

904
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,268
She's totally on board.

905
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,270
On board for what?

906
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:32,842
For us. For this. For what we're doing.

907
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,777
Where are you going with this?

908
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,179
Lauren has a friend, Chloe.

909
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:43,918
And Lately she's been out of control, lost.

910
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,152
We need to get her back.

911
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,020
She's right.

912
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:48,989
Chloe's having a lot of problems.

913
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:53,126
Family, school, drinking, cutting.

914
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:54,094
Last night she came over to my house

915
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:56,197
and just started attacking me.

916
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,799
It's like the girl that I knew is gone,

917
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:00,300
and I don't know where she went.

918
00:59:00,302 --> 00:59:04,038
I'm afraid for her. We all are.

919
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,474
- So Chloe, she's in high school.
- She's 18.

920
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,476
Still, this is an issue for her parents.

921
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,378
I spoke to her mother, and
she's open to discussing it.

922
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,780
I don't know how much Olivia has told you,

923
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:15,148
but there's a rigorous battery

924
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,983
of psychological and emotional tests...

925
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:19,119
I know she needs our help, Reverend.

926
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:22,090
...in order to rule out mental
health or substance abuse issues

927
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:25,092
before I can even consider an exorcism.

928
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,927
And, as Olivia knows,

929
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,496
very few people meet the
criteria that we've set.

930
00:59:29,498 --> 00:59:31,331
Just agree to meet with Chloe and her mom,

931
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,967
and if she's a bad fit, then
we'll drop it, I promise.

932
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:35,302
Please.

933
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:37,506
If you could just see her.

934
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:45,279
Okay, well, see if they can
come by tomorrow afternoon

935
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,248
just for a consult, nothing more.

936
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,152
- I understand.
- Thank you.

937
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:17,043
<i>You're worthless. Stupid, so stupid!</i>

938
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:18,512
<i>Everyone hates you.</i>

939
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,551
<i>Your soul is as ugly as you are.</i>

940
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:33,494
<i>Chloe!</i>

941
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:37,367
<i>You're alone. You'll
always be alone.</i>

942
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,040
<i>[voices muttering]</i>

943
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,312
<i>You should just kill yourself!</i>

944
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:09,198
[scissors snipping]

945
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,172
I asked you a question.
Do you know your name?

946
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:20,608
Chloe, I'm gonna ask
you a series of questions

947
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:24,110
that are designed to determine
the origin of your behavior.

948
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:27,915
The more truthful the responses,
the more accurate the test.

949
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,586
Do you understand that?

950
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:37,625
One: Have you ever exhibited
uncontrollable outbursts

951
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:40,628
of anger and violence?

952
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,462
Yes.

953
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:45,299
Two: Have you ever abused substances

954
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,567
like alcohol or drugs?

955
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:48,637
Yes.

956
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:52,907
Three:

957
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:56,978
Have you ever attempted
to take your own life?

958
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,281
Yes.

959
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,449
We can stop at any time.

960
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:05,621
No. I want to go on.

961
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:12,592
Four: Have you ever engaged
in any self-abusive behavior,

962
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:17,600
such as bulimia, anorexia,
or self-mutilation?

963
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:22,538
Yes.

964
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:29,576
Question five: Are you consumed
with feelings of guilt and...

965
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:33,413
48: Do you feel that you're
being treated unfairly

966
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:36,552
because others are jealous of you?

967
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:40,954
Yes.

968
01:02:40,956 --> 01:02:46,259
49: Do you feel that you can
trust what you see and hear?

969
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:47,496
No.

970
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:52,132
Okay, last question:

971
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:54,637
Do you feel others are
plotting against you?

972
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:04,180
Yes.

973
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:09,317
Reverend?

974
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:14,188
I don't feel that an exorcism
is the right solution for Chloe.

975
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,958
- Reverend Young, I think that you...
- Listen, Chloe is disturbed.

976
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,259
Of that much, I'm certain.

977
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:21,295
But I believe her symptoms
are more consistent

978
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,163
with mental illness than a possession.

979
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:25,398
I must be able to rule
out psychiatric disorders

980
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,335
in order to proceed in this case,

981
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,969
and I simply cannot.

982
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,538
But Emma Walters, she
had the same symptoms:

983
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,306
the voices and the visions.

984
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:36,509
Okay, first of all, confidentiality laws

985
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:40,380
strictly forbid me from
discussing my other cases.

986
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:43,451
Secondly, there are a
number of possible causes

987
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,253
for what Chloe has been experiencing.

988
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,688
For example, it's not uncommon

989
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,657
for people that are
afflicted with schizophrenia

990
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:53,094
to experience hallucinations.

991
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:58,135
And then you combine that with
a level of paranoia, and...

992
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:02,203
I think you see where I'm going with this.

993
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,704
My recommendation is to admit her...

994
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:05,672
You mean commit.

995
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:08,041
No, to admit her into a clinical facility

996
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:09,643
where she can be monitored,

997
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,112
where she can get the help she needs.

998
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,581
Please help her.

999
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,315
Please help my daughter.

1000
01:04:15,317 --> 01:04:18,319
Your daughter needs medical care.

1001
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:20,823
May God be with you.

1002
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,247
Don't worry. We're gonna help her.

1003
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,559
Is it Chloe?

1004
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,795
Yeah. I just can't back off.

1005
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:04,632
But at the same time, I feel so helpless.

1006
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,500
But I know she's not crazy.

1007
01:05:07,502 --> 01:05:10,137
Just changed.

1008
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:14,208
Like something else is taking over her.

1009
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,478
- Well, you know, it's her life.
- I know.

1010
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,148
You can still help her by
being supportive no matter what.

1011
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,684
How?

1012
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:28,621
Well, it's just something
you feel in your gut.

1013
01:05:28,623 --> 01:05:31,092
You know, it just kinda
pops in there just like that,

1014
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,494
and you just know it's right.

1015
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,197
So I should trust my gut.

1016
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,567
As long as it's attached
firmly to your head.

1017
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,235
Your gut can be a pretty
wise part of your body.

1018
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:43,704
[chuckles]

1019
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:47,440
That's how I ended up marrying your dad,

1020
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:48,541
even though he tried to tell me

1021
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,645
he was the Red Sox's first baseman.

1022
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:54,581
Believe me, every other
girl would've run screaming,

1023
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,650
but I thought it was charming,

1024
01:05:57,652 --> 01:06:02,389
especially since he was
only 5'9" and a buck-fifty.

1025
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:05,259
I don't remember that much about him.

1026
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,329
Oh, he was a great dad,

1027
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:10,898
and he loved you so much.

1028
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,699
You know, you were always the
first thing he talked about

1029
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:15,302
when he woke up in the morning,

1030
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,607
and the last thing before he went to sleep.

1031
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:26,913
Have I told you lately
how proud you make me?

1032
01:06:26,915 --> 01:06:29,683
Not in so many words.

1033
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,886
Well, forgive me...

1034
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:35,057
because you make me so proud.

1035
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,995
Everyone should be so lucky.

1036
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:45,599
Thanks, Mom.

1037
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,369
You're welcome.

1038
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,369
Now eat.

1039
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:50,539
Okay.

1040
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:39,686
Chapter two features a group of soldiers

1041
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,657
talking to their chaplain in the mess.

1042
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,694
And because of their contempt for religion,

1043
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,962
the soldiers taunted the chaplain,

1044
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:54,768
even going so far as to question
aspects of his personal life.

1045
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:59,739
Now, Henry refused to join in.

1046
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:01,741
Miss Brady?

1047
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:02,576
Yes?

1048
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,378
Can you tell us what Hemingway meant

1049
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,947
in chapter two of <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>

1050
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:12,055
when the narrator refers
to thinking men as atheists?

1051
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:15,655
Um...

1052
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:18,792
Sorry. Let me look.

1053
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,729
Mm-hmm. Perhaps Hemingway's narrator

1054
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:24,398
may conclude from your
performance right here

1055
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,568
that you are indeed
quite devout, Miss Brady.

1056
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,038
Busted.

1057
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,542
Maybe Hemingway was wrong.

1058
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,278
Enlighten us.

1059
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,579
Well, for all his bravado about atheism,

1060
01:08:39,581 --> 01:08:41,681
Hemingway ended up a broken man.

1061
01:08:41,683 --> 01:08:44,318
An alcoholic who had managed to ruin

1062
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,019
every stable or productive relationship

1063
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:48,454
he ever had in his entire life.

1064
01:08:48,456 --> 01:08:51,759
Maybe that's how his atheism paid him back.

1065
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:55,028
Yet here we are, decades
after Hemingway's death,

1066
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,930
still reading his novels.

1067
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:59,667
I didn't create the reading list.

1068
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:03,807
Oh. If you did, what would you have chosen?

1069
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:09,909
You know, some of the best authors

1070
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:12,945
are from a lot further back than Hemingway.

1071
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:16,949
John, Paul, Peter, Luke.

1072
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:19,122
- The Beatles?
- [laughter]

1073
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,591
I love it when someone
puts that jerk in his place.

1074
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,094
It's just Lauren sounded
like one of The Chosen today.

1075
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,430
- Man, you're crazy.
- No, man, you heard her.

1076
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:30,730
You were right there.

1077
01:09:30,732 --> 01:09:32,765
She said Ernest Hemingway is evil.

1078
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:35,336
She's just been a little distracted is all.

1079
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,904
Speaking of which, word
on the street is that, uh,

1080
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:41,708
you and Lauren have been
distracting each other lately.

1081
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:45,878
Yeah, we're, uh, we're just friends.

1082
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,348
Mase, I know you want to keep it on the DL

1083
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,948
since you guys have
been friends for a while,

1084
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,019
but you're just avoiding the inevitable.

1085
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:08,001
Oh, man! Dude, I hope you already got some

1086
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:11,104
because it looks like that
booty train's coming to a stop.

1087
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:14,375
Next stop, Jesus station!

1088
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,979
Whoo-whoo!

1089
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:22,783
Okay, let me see if I understand you.

1090
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,152
You wanna do this without Reverend Young?

1091
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,988
He hasn't given us any other choice.

1092
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,690
Look, I know I'm not as into this
whole religion thing as you guys.

1093
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:33,961
I mean I'm just starting to go
back to church after a long time.

1094
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:37,430
But you've gotta understand
why this kind of freaks me out.

1095
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:39,600
Lauren, we're all scared
of what we don't understand.

1096
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,701
It's normal.

1097
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,036
But I've assisted Reverend
Young in a bunch of these.

1098
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,706
Exactly. Assisted.

1099
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,908
Do you really think
you can do this, Olivia?

1100
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,443
Why not?

1101
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,110
I know the prayers. I know the process.

1102
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:52,979
Yeah, it's not the same thing.

1103
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,915
Maybe we can talk to him again.

1104
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,050
He's not going to. Trust me.

1105
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,819
If we're gonna do this,

1106
01:10:59,821 --> 01:11:01,721
we're gonna have to do it ourselves.

1107
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:03,689
What if something happens
or something goes wrong?

1108
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:06,592
Nothing's going to happen Lauren.
We've done this many times.

1109
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:08,461
You mean you've watched this many times.

1110
01:11:08,463 --> 01:11:11,931
You heard her mom. They've
tried everything else.

1111
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:14,600
I know.

1112
01:11:14,602 --> 01:11:16,436
Believe me, I know.

1113
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,641
Just make sure she's at the church by 8:00.

1114
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:23,212
Okay, I will.

1115
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,749
[class bell rings]

1116
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,684
Lauren, hey.

1117
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,920
- Hey.
- Um, you got a second?

1118
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:34,555
Um, I actually really have to go.

1119
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:36,489
What's going on?

1120
01:11:36,491 --> 01:11:37,558
What do you mean?

1121
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,193
I mean, the way you've been acting.

1122
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:41,028
Talking about the Bible in English class,

1123
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,663
and suddenly you're having
lunch with Olivia and The Chosen?

1124
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:45,933
What, I need permission
to have lunch with someone.

1125
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:48,100
No! No, of course not.

1126
01:11:48,102 --> 01:11:52,104
It's just, Mase is a little worried.

1127
01:11:52,106 --> 01:11:53,372
Frankly, we all are.

1128
01:11:53,374 --> 01:11:56,710
Well if Mase wants to talk to
me, he can call me at any time.

1129
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,644
He's a good guy, Lauren.

1130
01:11:58,646 --> 01:12:00,747
I don't want to see him get hurt.

1131
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,082
No one's getting hurt.

1132
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:05,118
I promise.

1133
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,056
Seriously, is everything okay?

1134
01:12:10,558 --> 01:12:13,060
You know that Chloe's been
having some trouble lately.

1135
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,827
That's a bit of an understatement.

1136
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:16,262
Well, Olivia's offered to help.

1137
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:17,831
- Olivia?
- Yeah.

1138
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,632
I know it sounds a little crazy, but...

1139
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:20,833
Don't take this the wrong way,

1140
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:23,604
but are you sure that you want her help?

1141
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:25,671
What's that supposed to mean?

1142
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:28,007
Come on, you see the way that
she walks around with her friends,

1143
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:30,543
like they're better than everyone else.

1144
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:32,813
Every time she looks at me, I feel
like she's judging me or something.

1145
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,515
Well, she wants to help.

1146
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,984
I know Chloe is going through
a really difficult time,

1147
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:37,851
and you're a good friend.

1148
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,152
You're worried about her. I get it.

1149
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:43,290
But I think she needs real help,

1150
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,759
like professional medical help.

1151
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,127
Yeah, her mom has tried everything.

1152
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:50,063
Believe me, nothing's worked.

1153
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:52,866
Well then what is Olivia possibly
gonna do that they couldn't?

1154
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,068
Pray for her?

1155
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,869
Or something.

1156
01:12:56,871 --> 01:12:59,573
I... I'll try anything at this point.

1157
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:02,175
I gotta run. I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1158
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,312
Okay.

1159
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,273
- Where are you taking her?
- Just for a drive.

1160
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,076
I think the fresh air will be good for her.

1161
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,679
I suppose so, while she's still able.

1162
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:41,582
What do you mean, while she's able?

1163
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,317
I've decided to place
her in a care facility

1164
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:44,917
in Garland next week.

1165
01:13:44,919 --> 01:13:46,953
- What?
- It breaks my heart to do it,

1166
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,355
but it's the only thing left.

1167
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:51,461
I'm afraid I've lost her.

1168
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,863
Well, we're gonna get her back, I promise.

1169
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:57,934
Come on, Chloe.

1170
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,803
Take care of her, Lauren.

1171
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,742
I will.

1172
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,202
Hey.

1173
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:11,438
Hey, this is gonna be good for you.

1174
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,707
For us.

1175
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,012
I promise I'm gonna make things okay again.

1176
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,061
<i>Don't let her do this!</i>

1177
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,130
<i>They're going to hurt you!</i>

1178
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,965
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

1179
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,867
<i>You're going to get hurt!</i>

1180
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,969
Chloe? What is going
on? What are you hearing?

1181
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,637
I wanna go back. I don't wanna be here.

1182
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:48,375
- Olivia! Olivia, help!
- I just wanna go back!
- Let's get her into the sanctuary.

1183
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,409
Come on. You'll be okay.

1184
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:52,712
No, no, no! I don't want to go in there!

1185
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:56,248
- Chloe, it's gonna be okay.
- No, no, no!

1186
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,018
You're gonna come with us.
We're gonna get you all better.

1187
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,922
Do you understand?

1188
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,890
Once this starts, there's no going back.

1189
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,726
You have to decide. Are you in or out?

1190
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,163
Lauren?

1191
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:11,264
I'm in.

1192
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:12,334
Then let's begin.

1193
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,737
No, no, no!

1194
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:20,107
No, no, please! No, no!

1195
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,308
The devil is strong in you, Chloe.

1196
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:24,010
You must save your energy to
help us get him out of there.

1197
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,278
What are they doing? What's going on?

1198
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,448
We're gonna need you to be strong for Him.

1199
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,751
- Lauren!
- It's gonna be okay, Chloe.

1200
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,588
- I promise.
- I'm so scared.

1201
01:16:39,527 --> 01:16:42,128
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1202
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,430
hallowed be thy name,

1203
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,765
thy kingdom come, thy will be done

1204
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,833
on earth as it is in heaven.

1205
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,836
Give us this day our daily bread

1206
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,438
and forgive us our trespasses

1207
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,974
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1208
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,010
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil,

1209
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:01,014
for thine is the kingdom,
the power, the glory forever.

1210
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,884
Amen.

1211
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:04,717
Lauren...

1212
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,987
From all evil, deliver us, O Lord.

1213
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,387
Deliver us, O Lord.

1214
01:17:08,389 --> 01:17:11,056
Oh, Lauren, please.

1215
01:17:11,058 --> 01:17:13,560
From all sins, from anger and hatred,

1216
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:14,560
from lightning and tempest,

1217
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:17,363
from plague and famine,
from everlasting death,

1218
01:17:17,365 --> 01:17:20,167
by the mystery of your holy
incarnation, deliver us.

1219
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:21,801
Deliver us, O Lord.

1220
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,403
We exorcise you,

1221
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,070
every impure spirit,

1222
01:17:25,072 --> 01:17:26,473
every satanic power,

1223
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,975
every incursion of the infernal adversary,

1224
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:34,014
every legion, every
congregation and diabolical sect.

1225
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,250
Thus, cursed demon and
every diabolical legion,

1226
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,385
we implore you.

1227
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,452
Cease this deception.

1228
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:43,189
Go away, inventor and master of all deceit.

1229
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,926
Enemy of humanity's salvation,

1230
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:47,993
stand humble under the
powerful hand of God,

1231
01:17:47,995 --> 01:17:50,229
by whose name you tremble and flee.

1232
01:17:50,231 --> 01:17:51,564
Go away.

1233
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:58,939

1234
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:00,040
We can be here all night.

1235
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:03,109
How long this takes is
completely up to you, Chloe.

1236
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,012
Do you renounce the devil
as your lord and master?

1237
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:09,049
Answer the question!

1238
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:12,187
Do you renounce the devil
as your lord and master?

1239
01:18:13,387 --> 01:18:15,087
Leave then, impious one!

1240
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:17,556
Depart, accursed one!
Leave with all your deceits.

1241
01:18:17,558 --> 01:18:19,326
Give honor to God the almighty.

1242
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,060
Give place to the Lord Jesus Christ,

1243
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:23,198
who shed His blood for us.

1244
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:28,635
What are you doing?

1245
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,007
You want to help her,
don't you? Stand back.

1246
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,244
N-N-No!

1247
01:18:38,112 --> 01:18:41,350
[coughing]

1248
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:48,054
Stop! What are you doing?
You're torturing her!

1249
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,023
- She's healing.
- She's suffering!

1250
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,224
Lauren, you're having a crisis of faith.

1251
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,493
I am not the one
waterboarding someone here.

1252
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:57,162
I guess I always knew in the back
of my mind you were too close to her.

1253
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:59,801
You never got cut to your
core by the little whore.

1254
01:19:05,106 --> 01:19:09,576
She took away the one thing
in my life that I really loved.

1255
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,110
I was gonna spend the
rest of my life with him,

1256
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:13,380
and she took that from me!

1257
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:16,416
You are the crazy one. Untie her.

1258
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,185
Untie her now!

1259
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,688
OLIVIA: We can't save Chloe
if she's gonna interfere.

1260
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,189
Go on!

1261
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:25,125
Take her away.

1262
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,426
What? No!

1263
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,330
Let go of me!

1264
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:33,500
No. No, please.

1265
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,301
We're gonna need more water.

1266
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,739
Let me go! Leave her alone!

1267
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:43,479
No. No!

1268
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,562
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

1269
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,738
Come on.

1270
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,275
Come on.

1271
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,078
Something made you this way, Chloe.

1272
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,081
That is why we must finish.

1273
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:24,117
Did you like the message
I left on your garage?

1274
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,722
Or how about the photo
I took from Brad's phone?

1275
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,155
You could've had any boy you wanted,

1276
01:20:30,157 --> 01:20:32,528
but you had to have mine.

1277
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:48,241
No, no, please, God, no! Please!

1278
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,609
What did you just say?

1279
01:20:50,611 --> 01:20:53,246
"Please, God?"

1280
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,780
What do you know about God?

1281
01:20:54,782 --> 01:20:57,516
You don't know anything about God!

1282
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:58,654
No, no, no!

1283
01:21:00,588 --> 01:21:02,788
May this holy water
envelop your spirit and soul

1284
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:06,626
to choke away the great
deceiver Lucifer from your body.

1285

1286
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,741

[coughing]

1288
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:24,676
I don't believe your
heart is ready to let go,

1289
01:21:24,678 --> 01:21:27,046
but we might get you there yet.

1290
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,049
Let us continue.

1291
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:33,353
Leave her, master of all
deceit, enemy of man's salvation!

1292
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:37,122
From the snares of the
devil, deliver us, O Lord.

1293
01:21:37,124 --> 01:21:38,323
Olivia, this has gone too far!

1294
01:21:38,325 --> 01:21:40,395
Leave my friend alone!

1295
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,967
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
what she was gonna do to you.

1296
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,205
Come on, let's go.

1297
01:21:55,142 --> 01:21:57,546
- Can you make it?
- Yeah, I think so.

1298
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:06,821
- No!
- No, no!

1299
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:15,394
OLIVIA: Lauren, Chloe, where are you?

1300
01:22:15,396 --> 01:22:16,698
We have to get out of here now.

1301
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,944
Okay, in here.

1302
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,539
I know you're in here.

1303
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:04,646
We can't stop now. We were so close.

Come on, come on.

1308
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,598
No! Come on!

1309
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,637
I was just trying to help her.

1310
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:33,939
Olivia, look, we can all walk
out of this together, okay?

1311
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:35,241
We can work this out.

1312
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,609
We could've been friends...

1313
01:23:37,611 --> 01:23:40,380
if you would've just let me
do what I was supposed to do!

1314
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,480
I... I can't breathe.

1315
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:43,315
But you didn't have faith.

1316
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:45,350
You don't know what it's
like to believe in something

1317
01:23:45,352 --> 01:23:46,719
bigger and better than you.

1318
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,287
No, please stop. You're hurting her.

1319
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,956
You don't know what you're doing.

1320
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,225
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1321
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,063
- No!
- Get away from her!

1322
01:24:00,968 --> 01:24:03,302
I'm sorry.

1323
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,605

1328

- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi.

1329

You look like you're doing great.

1330
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,747
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

1331
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,916
I am so sorry about what happened.

1332
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,351
You don't owe me an apology.

1333
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:53,853
I know that you tried to help me.

1334
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:57,489
What she did had nothing to
do with you or your church.

1335
01:24:57,491 --> 01:25:01,693
It was all her, and it's over now.

1336
01:25:01,695 --> 01:25:03,930
And look, I was in a really bad place,

1337
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,498
and I'm here now,

1338
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,668
and maybe things happen for a reason

1339
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,404
that people don't quite understand.

1340
01:25:12,406 --> 01:25:14,006
I suppose so.

1341
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:15,742
She spent some time at Garland,

1342
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:20,279
and she's still on medication
and being monitored closely,

1343
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:25,051
but... I feel like I have my daughter back.

1344
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,918
I'm really happy to see you took my advice.

1345
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,654
Thank you, Reverend.

Not to take any of the
steam out of your big day,

1353
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:23,876
but I got a call from a certain
Southern California soccer coach

1354
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,110
about you the other day.

1355
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:29,818
You should stay near your phone
over the next couple of weeks.
