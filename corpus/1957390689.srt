Whoo!

180
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:19,224
- Ana: (pants) Where are we?
- The front.

181
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,361
Where we belong.

182
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,132
Down the hatch!

183
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,305
- What's in there?
- Your rescue party.

184
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,475
You like parties, don't you?

185
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,679
- No.
- Well, you'll like this one.

186
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:55,494
- (exhales) What is this?
- U-boat. All that's left of it.

187
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,232
We took the liberty. This way!

188
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:10,642
- I feel so tired.
- Here.

189
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,948
You won't need this anymore.

190
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,473
You're in quite a storm.

191
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,259
I'll find you something
to change into.

192

Remarkable reflexes.

196
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,592
Nice shot.
That'll come in handy.

197
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,899
Smoke?

198
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,637
So, what brings you here?

199
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,876
- I think I'm bird watching.
- Hmm. See anything good?

200
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,783
- A swan? It looked like a swan.
- Nasty creatures.

201
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:02,320
- I never go near 'em.
- (cups clattering)

202
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:03,622
What else do you remember?

203
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:09,427
Uh, there's a soldier
that came out of the sky.

204
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,497
- He's a goner.
- That's enough, Beatriz.

205
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:14,934

- Hmm. We'll call you Ana.

Here. That's B. I'm Gert.

209

You can't see anything
interesting in the light.

Not here, you won't.
Come on!

Yeah.

Now, Ana,
we got you a little present.

Kind of like
a birthday present.

Look alive, Bea!
We need a target!

- I think you're just the girl.
- I've never been in a war.

You've been in a war
your whole life.

You just didn't know it.

260
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,185
Do you remember what happened
to you before you came here?

261
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,320
Before the storm?

262
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,261
- No.
- It wasn't a very good story.

263
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:16,001
- So, I'm giving you a new one.
- Is my story that bad?

264

So bad, you had to end it.

Am I dead?

266
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,216
Yes. Yes, you are dead, Ana,
but don't panic.

267
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,085
- Girls are better off dead.
- Why?

268
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,719
'Cause now, we're free.

269
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,090
You never had a chance
back there, Ana.

270
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,160
- Chance for what?
- A chance to win.

Come on.

272
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,348
Girls make excellent snipers.

273
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,951
A sniper must endure
uncomfortable positions

Marsha: Dead center.

280
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,015
Now, you have
to slow down your breathing.

281
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,751
A heartbeat
can throw off the shot.

282
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,856
So, when my heart stops,
that's when I shoot?

283
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:46,025
Exactly.

284
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,701

Were you in a lot of trouble?

291
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,269
The worst.

would you wanna do that?

874
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:30,462
Because I'm done with this.

875
01:15:32,731 --> 01:15:34,133
That's not what I heard.

876
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:38,103
Ana.

877
01:15:40,472 --> 01:15:41,573
You got a smoke?

878
01:15:42,308 --> 01:15:44,243
Gert told me not to bring these.

879
01:15:44,777 --> 01:15:46,211
Gert can be a drag.

880
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:50,382
Light me?

881
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:54,253
Why are you
all the way out here?

882
01:15:58,624 --> 01:15:59,958
(hisses sharply)

883
01:16:02,761 --> 01:16:04,263
I don't play well with others.

884
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,704
I'm going back.
I still have a friend there.

885
01:16:12,338 --> 01:16:14,106
I just spoke to him
on the radio.

886
01:16:17,276 --> 01:16:19,111
What a phenomenal girl you are.

887
01:16:20,346 --> 01:16:22,448
And how do you imagine
you'd get there?

888
01:16:22,581 --> 01:16:23,482
Swim.

889
01:16:24,049 --> 01:16:26,151
You can't swim
against the currents.

890
01:16:26,652 --> 01:16:27,753
I'm a strong swimmer.

891
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:31,523
(chuckles) Now I see
why Marsha's been acting up.

892
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:35,527
- You're outshining her.
- Please.

893
01:16:35,994 --> 01:16:37,229
Gert said you could help us.

894
01:16:37,463 --> 01:16:39,098
I don't think we're seeing
the whole picture.

895
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:45,471
No one could see that.
Would be interesting, though.

896
01:16:47,906 --> 01:16:48,874
You'd have to

897
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:51,610
be in the right place
at the right time.

898
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:54,279
(sighs)

899
01:16:54,613 --> 01:16:57,082
I always thought we'd get
much farther than this.

900
01:16:58,384 --> 01:17:01,019
A girl gets tired
of the same, old yarn.

901
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:04,456
But it can't happen.

902
01:17:05,991 --> 01:17:06,892
Why not?

903
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:09,995
You ever think about
what happens to us

904
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:13,365
- if you go, Ana?
- Ana: No.

905
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:19,037
We lose. End of story.

906
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:23,409
- End of us. All of us.
- No. You can't lose.

907
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:26,945
- There's so many girls.
- (scoffs) Okay.

908
01:17:28,747 --> 01:17:32,251
Didn't Marsha tell you
what happens when a star dies?

909
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,621
It's like that.

910
01:17:37,891 --> 01:17:39,458
If a star goes,

911
01:17:40,325 --> 01:17:43,328
everything around it
gets pulled in.

912
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,365
And we disappear.

913
01:17:50,402 --> 01:17:51,336
(scoffs)

914
01:17:52,872 --> 01:17:56,375
It's just the way it works.
Sorry to break it to you.

915
01:18:06,318 --> 01:18:08,020
You're still gonna need this.

916

(electronic warbling, beeping)

917
01:18:22,634 --> 01:18:25,671
- So what did she say?
- I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:18:29,508 --> 01:18:31,677
- Gert: Why not?
- I'm just not.

919
01:18:36,315 --> 01:18:38,283
Well, if it's about us,
don't worry.

920
01:18:39,551 --> 01:18:42,521
- We know what happens.
- Bea: Yeah.

921
01:18:44,056 --> 01:18:45,624
- I'll be your wingman.
- Ana: No.

922
01:18:46,525 --> 01:18:47,626
No.

923
01:18:50,028 --> 01:18:51,363
If she's happy, I'm happy.

924

925

No-no, no-no ♪</i>

926
01:18:58,403 --> 01:19:02,741
You could come with me.
You could come with me!

927
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:10,182
- It's too late for us.
- Bea: But not for you.

928
01:19:11,951 --> 01:19:13,485
Ana: I can't do that.

929
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:17,422
I can't.

930
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:20,392
I'm tired of seeing
all the girls in trouble.

931
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:25,798
If you go back,
maybe you can help the next one.

932
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:29,601
What about the girls here?

933
01:19:31,403 --> 01:19:34,506
Well, we asked them.

934
01:19:36,742 --> 01:19:37,676
Come.

942

Okay.

943
01:20:51,717 --> 01:20:54,286
So, when the storm
is strong enough,

944
01:20:54,586 --> 01:20:56,488
you'll swim back
the way you came.

945
01:20:56,722 --> 01:20:58,791
Bea's balloons
will measure the storm.

946
01:20:58,925 --> 01:21:01,126
We'll get you
to the center of it,

947
01:21:01,326 --> 01:21:02,594
where you'll be
a little lighter,

948
01:21:02,795 --> 01:21:05,464
and you might be able
to just slip through.

949
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:08,367
You'll have to swim directly
into the current.

950
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,803
You can't be off,
even by a hair.

951
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:15,207
You'll have to be right on time.
But I don't know when that is.

952
01:21:15,741 --> 01:21:18,176
Where will she be
if she's not there on time?

953
01:21:18,978 --> 01:21:19,979
Nowhere good.

You're going back
to the kitchen.

964

You don't need
to worry about me, Marsha.

965
01:22:35,888 --> 01:22:36,823

968

(pants) I made you into a hero.

969
