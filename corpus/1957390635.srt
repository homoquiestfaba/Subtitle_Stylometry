00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,693
[guests laughing]

5
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,198
Yeah, because
there's, there's...

6
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,534
- Ooh.
- Jamie, baby.

7
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,436
- Blake, baby.
- You're 30.

8
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,639
- I'm a woman now.
- You look so old.

9
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,407
- It's sad.
- Just yesterday,

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,642
- you were in your prime.
- Right?

11
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,644
And today, you're
even hotter, like.

12
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:19,179
What are people supposed
to do with all of this?

13
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,548
People can't handle that.

14
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,382
- I think they'll die.
- Rapid fire.

15
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,450
What are you most excited for?

16
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,418
It's your 30th year.

17
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,587
- 31st.
- Shut up.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,387
- Go.
- Oh, we're going to Rome.

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,590
And Coachella.

20
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,357
I got an expensive
gym membership.

21
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,593
You're gonna get ripped.

22
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,360
- I want an eight pack.
- Get one on the front

23
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,262
and the back.
[Jamie oohs]

24
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,798
[gasps] We're going
to Disneyland with Nana.

25
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,299
- That's gonna be really-
- Blake!

26
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,434
- Hi.
- How was your, uh,

27
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,637
- Tinder date with Scott?
- Oh, you know about Scott.

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,706
Oh, she was asking
where you were earlier.

29
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,206
- [Sarah chuckles]
- How do you know his name?

30
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,176
- I just met him today.
- I love details.

31
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,144
- Ooh, mm, mm.
- Ooh! [giggles]

32
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:55,282
- Um, it was okay, thanks.
- Of course it was.

33
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,584
You smell so good.

34
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,555
- So how was it really?
- It was six hours long

35
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,523
and we made out in a bounce
house, I might be in love.

36
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,291
She was like really
close to my face, right?

37
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,425
- Yeah, no she was.
- Happy Birthday,

38
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,861
- Jamie.
- Ooh, thank you, Sarah!

39
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,630
Whoa, I thought you were
gonna kiss me just then,

40
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,431
and I was like, wait,
what is happening?

41
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,266
- Okay, I'll, like, right, let's kiss.
- Okay.

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,201
- Oh.
- I'm kidding.

43
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,603
- No, you're okay.
- Unless you want to.

44
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:19,172
- Oh, yeah, maybe later.
- Later, okay.

45
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,843
- Aw!
- No, not really, though, oh.

46
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,244
30th year, keep going.

47
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,346
Um, my fourth graders
finally love me.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,715
Class pets for the win.

49
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,483
We're gonna have some
really fun parties.

50
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,318
And your March Madness
bracket is a thing of beauty.

51
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,755
- Tom Hanks is healthy.
- That's always a plus.

52
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:36,658
I'm buying stock, I'm
thinking airlines and hotels.

53
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,358
Woo, grown up, I like it.

54
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,528
I've just got a good
feeling about everything.

55
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,362
Oh no, I don't want
everyone to sing.

56
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,598
Come on, I know you.

57
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,966
Everybody, yell happy
birthday on three.

58
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:49,871
- One, two, three!
- Happy birthday! [cheering]

59
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,444
[Podcast] We now
have over 51,000

60
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,478
cases of COVID-19 in
[Blake sighs]

61
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,380
the United States, as cited

62
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,650
by Johns Hopkins University.

63
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:05,385
There are more than 500
people who have died.

64
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:07,855
- [somber music]
- While there have been

65
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,826
more than 470,000 cases
confirmed worldwide,

66
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,895
those numbers will
probably be much higher

67
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,462
by the time you
actually hear this

68
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,898
as cases are skyrocketing

69
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,266
- so quickly now.
- The Center for Disease

70
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,368
Control says it's too
soon to tell exactly

71
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,671
when the pandemic will end.

72
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,839
In fact, back in
February, I heard

73
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,307
this could be a
recurring illness that

74
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,011
- mutates every year.
- Given the degree and the

75
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,513
efficiency of transmissibility
[Blake exhales heavily]

76
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,447
of this virus, that

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,950
- we might have a cycle.
- Now the pandemic

78
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,519
has definitely begun to
snowball in the United States,

79
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,554
there's a sense that
[Jamie exhales heavily]

80
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,022
the worldwide epidemic will be

81
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,925
- centered on the United States.
- It is shattering, just

82
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,394
the rates that this has
overwhelmingly changed

83
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,630
- our lives.
- Now a vaccine is unlikely

84
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:52,432
for probably 12 to 18 months.

85
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,434
And it's just beginning.

86
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,403
The World Health Organization

87
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,573
said the pandemic won't
peak for at least a few

88
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,709
more months. The death
toll could even re-

[upbeat music]

90
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,479
Hey, sorry.

[spray can hissing]

92
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,735
[water burbling]

93
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,378
- Still no flour?
- Nope,

94
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,548
everything was gone
but the produce.

95
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,315
There was a guy in
line with a cart

96
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,085
literally full of cucumbers.

97
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,987
He just looked at
me and was like,

98
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,855
"I guess I'll make
some pickles."

99
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,657
- That's haunting.
- It was.

[phone chimes]

101
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,995
- You hear from Scott?
- No,

102
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,532
I seriously met him at the
worst moment in human history.

103
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,768
Mm, best Tinder date of your
life, novel Coronavirus.

104
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:01,969
Hey, your makeup came.

105
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:04,705
Ooh! Have you reached
out to him at all?

106
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,107
I sent him a text last week,

107
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,475
kinda tryna sum up
all this weirdness,

108
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,645
but he didn't even respond.

109
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,346
Man, they forgot my Boy Brow.

110
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm really proud of you
for continuing to try.

111
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,484
You know, it's bare minimum.

112
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,554
It makes me feel
like a real boy.

113
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,355
- I respect that.
- You are a real boy.

114
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,593
- You're a real boy, Harry.
- So what'd you say to him?

115
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,861
Mm, I sent him that GIF,

116
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,730
you know, the one of
the muppet that's like,

117
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,966
and the camera zooms in
on his face. [laughs]

118
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,669
That's it? Did you
send a text with it?

119
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,038
Well, I feel like the
GIF says it all, you know?

120
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,808
Hey, funny GIF, and
I care about you,

121
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,144
but not a weird amount 'cause
we only hung out one time.

122
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,879
Also, isn't this crazy?

123
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,014
Maybe we should stay in contact

124
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,951
in case someday we can touch
mouths again, but no pressure.

125
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,853
Have a great summer, stay cool.

126
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:52,787
Do you like me?

127
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,622
You don't have to say. Asterisk.

128
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,624
Down at the bottom of
the page, footnote,

129
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,792
because I kinda like you.

130
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:58,960
Whoops. Uh oh.

131
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,929
- Blake.
- It's better without words.

132
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:05,566
Okay, he's probably just
stressed about COVID.

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,569
Plus, I feel guilty for even
thinking about guys right now,

134
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,539
- people are dying.
- Yeah, I know.

135
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,442
I feel guilty for being
mad about my Boy Brow.

136
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,579
[Jamie and Blake sigh]

137
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,747
One more?

138
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,549
[Jamie and Blake inhale deeply]

139
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,919
[Jamie and Blake groan]

140
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,558
- Ah.
- At least we have company.

141
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,559
I think I'm over feeding them.

142
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,729
Yeah, that fat sweaty
one is not looking good.

143
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,899
Man, a month ago,
these mice made me a god

144
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,700
among my fourth graders.

145
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,436
Now, I'm just a grown-ass
single woman with pet mice.

146
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,438
Hey, you can
pull off pet mice.

147
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,576
You could pull off an ant farm,
that's how fabulous you are.

148
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,879
You're my whole
world now, little mice.

149
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:54,515
- Whoa, Jamie.
- What?

150
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,117
It's from Nana's nursing home.

151
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,020
"This letter is to alert you
that on March 23rd, 2020,

152
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,022
we learned that one or
more of our residents

153
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:04,725
- developed COVID-19."
- One or more?

154
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,794
And this was like a week ago.

155
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,096
We gotta check
our mail more often.

156
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,098
- [dial tone humming]
- You have reached

157
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,600
- the voicemail of
- Nana's still not picking up.

158
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,601
- 503.
- Try again.

159
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,036
I'll try the nursing home.

160
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,074
[suspenseful music]
[dial tone humming]

161
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,576
[Dora] Help us.

162
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,745
Um, uh, hello,

163
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,048
is, is this Willowbrook
Senior Care?

164
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,649
[Dora] Is this the police?

165
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:30,483
- Are you coming?
- Listen,

166
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,119
our grandmother is a resident

167
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:34,989
- at your facility and-
- Maybe not anymore,

168
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,826
she's probably a
resident in heaven above.

169
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,695
I'm sorry, who
are we talking to?

170
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,697
- My name's Dora.
- Could you just,

171
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,631
could you just tell us,

172
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,865
does our Nana have COVID?

173
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,936
[Dora] It is bad, honey, I
have never seen such carnage.

174
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,838
[Jamie] Can we speak
to whoever's in charge?

175
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,708
[Dora] COVID-19's
in charge now.

176
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,810
[Ackerman] Dora,
Dora, go lay down.

177
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,745
I'm so sorry, this
is Nurse Ackerman.

178
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,681
We just wanna know
if our grandma's safe,

179
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:03,784
uh, we got this letter
saying that you have COVID-19

180
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,519
- in your facility.
- Mm hm,

181
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:06,787
we've had a serious outbreak.

182
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:07,755
What's your grandmother's name?

183
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:11,092
- Paulina Jerikovic.
- Okay, let me check.

184
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,563
Okay, from what we know, she's
not exhibited any symptoms,

185
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,031
but, seriously, we
don't have enough gowns,

186
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,265
we don't have
enough face shields.

187
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,034
We've been trying to get
hold of the governor,

188
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,036
so if you can take care of
your grandmother at home,

189
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,605
that'd be much safer
than her being here.

190
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,875
Uh, we live in Albuquerque,
but our sister Erin

191
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,678
checked her in and she's
local in Washington.

192
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,279
Whatever you need to
do, the sooner the better.

193
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:35,716
Dora, where'd you get that
phone? Stop calling people.

194
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,952
- [dial tone beeps]
- Oh my gosh, um.

195
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,053
Are you calling them back?

196
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,888
No, I'm calling Erin.
[phone chimes]

197
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,790
[sighs] I haven't talked
to her since COVID started.

198
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,326
Oh my gosh, Jamie,
it's been so long.

199
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,029
- How are you, sister?
- Uh, weird.

200
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:49,864
Blake's with me,

201
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,665
we're, we're both weird.

202
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,067
Oh my gosh, why?

203
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,669
- Well, the pandemic.
- People dying.

204
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:56,670
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

205
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,306
It's so sad, my
girlfriend just had a baby

206
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,642
and they made her wear a mask.

207
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,144
Can you believe they
made her do that?

208
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,712
I mean, Jefferson's
birth was hard enough,

209
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,848
do you remember how hard
Jefferson's birth was?

210
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,317
Erin, Nana's nursing
home had a COVID outbreak

211
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,787
and we wanted to know if
you were gonna get her?

212
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,989
I'm not gonna abandon
the woman who raised us.

213
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,724
I was gonna bring her
back to our house.

214
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,359
Okay, we just wanted to know.

215
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,894
Um, when are you going?

216
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,862
'Cause she needs to
get out like right now.

217
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,597
Well, I can't get
there till Thursday

218
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,665
because we're on a cruise,

219
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,867
which has been such a nice
break from everything.

220
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,069
You know, everything
was just starting

221
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,870
to feel so heavy.
[upbeat music]

222
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,338
- Hey there, bumble bee.
- Hi.

223
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,040
Oh, hey, Jamie.

224
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,109
Hey, you've really thinned up.

225
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,877
- Thanks, Doug.
- I'm sorry,

226
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,612
- you're on a cruise?
- Yes.

227
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:41,348
- The tickets were so cheap.
- Because it's a death trap.

228
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,317
No, everyone's
being super careful

229
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,120
and they're soap in almost
all of the bathrooms.

230
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,689
So are you guys dating anyone?

231
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,093
- Okay, we gotta go, Erin.
- Erin, the finger food buffet

232
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,861
- just opened.
- Ooh, I gotta go too.

233
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,831
Bye.
[phone chimes]

234
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,836
[upbeat suspenseful music]

235
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,704
[Jamie] Still no
answer from Nana.

236
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,940
Google Maps says we can
get there in 20 hours,

237
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,174
if we leave right now,

238
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,876
we'll get there by
tomorrow afternoon.

239
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,744
Perfect, that
gives us a full day

240
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:14,682
before Erin gets back and
murders her with negligence.

241
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,851
- What?
- I don't want her to die.

242
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:20,287
She won't, we
just gotta focus.

243
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,189
Ooh, you smell like ham.

244
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,158
We should make some
ground rules to be safe.

245
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,160
- Our safety is her safety.
- Exactly.

246
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,795
We leave the car as
little as possible.

247
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,196
We only stop for
gas or to sleep.

248
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,831
No interacting with strangers.

249
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,266
- Don't touch your face!
- Ugh!

250
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,235
And the most
important rule of all...

251
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:35,936
you can't fall in love with me.

252
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,271
- Too late.
- Aw.

253
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:39,940
Okay, I think
we've got enough food

254
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,075
that we won't have
to go to any stores.

255
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,877
I'm packing biodegradable
wipes so we can just go

256
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,080
- on the side of the road.
- Whoa.

257
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,982
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- I'm taking the mice.

258
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,783
I don't want 'em to
starve while we're gone.

259
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,052
You can't bring those
mice. Nana hates mice.

260
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,921
Oh, I forgot that she

261
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,389
[Both] Poked that dead dog

262
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,992
and it ripped open and dozens
of bloody mice ran out.

263
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,026
Ugh, okay.

264
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,330
I could probably leave 'em
with one of my students,

265
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,932
Jacob Harper's like
obsessed with them.

266
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,066
- [seat belts click]
- Is that the kid

267
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,235
- who keeps texting you?
- Constantly.

268
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,470
Mostly it's about the mice,

269
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,205
but sometimes it's
like, "How are you?"

270
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,140
Or "You're a strong woman."

271
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,808
- He's nine?
- Yep.

272
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,944
- How'd he get your number?
- From a bathroom stall.

273
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,246
[Blake laughs]

274
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,714
But, really,
how'd he get number?

275
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,149
- I have no idea.
- Okay.

276
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,919
- [dial tone humming]
- Hello?

277
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,789
Hey, Mrs. Harper, hope
you're, um, healthy.

278
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,925
- Who's this?
- It's Jamie,

279
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,960
Miss Jerikovic, uh,
Jacob's teacher.

280
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,729
- Hi, Jamie.
- Oh, it's Miss Jerikovic.

281
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,198
[Mrs. Harper] Jacob,
put your shirt back on.

282
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:40,768
So I'm going on
this emergency trip,

283
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,969
uh, it's only for three days,

284
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:46,140
but I need someone to watch
over Bert and Ernie for me,

285
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,942
they're the pet mice from class.

286
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,477
- Ugh, really?
- We'll do it, Miss Jerikovic,

287
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,012
we'll take them!

288
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,314
- [Jacob hums]
- Jacob,

289
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,216
don't put my phone in
your mouth like that,

290
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:56,917
I have to put this
phone back on my face,

291
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,219
how do you think that
makes mommy feel?

292
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,287
No, I don't know,
Miss Jerikovic,

293
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,022
I, I'm sorry, it's just, I'm,

294
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,325
one more thing on my plate
right now, it's not ideal.

295
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,061
I know, and I can
totally find someone else,

296
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,330
it's just I know that Jacob
really likes these mice.

297
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,332
[Jacob] I love the
mice! I love the mice!

298
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,401
- I love the mice!
- Ugh, I know you love mice.

299
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:17,037
The wooden spoons don't
go in our pants, Jacob.

300
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,440
They go in the cow-print
jar by the stove,

301
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,975
and sauces and stews.

302
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,944
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
come back here, stop that.

303
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,413
Look at me, how many spoons
do you have down there?

304
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,315
How long are you gone for?

305
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,784
Miss Jerikovic, you said you're
only gone for three days?

306
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,554
- Oh, yes, yeah.
- And we'll basically

307
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,054
have to do nothing, right?

308
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:34,922
They just sit it in the cage?

309
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,824
Yep, you just
feed 'em once a day,

310
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,459
and then, you know, make
sure they're still breathing.

311
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:43,063
- Okay, fine, we'll take them.
- Yeah!

312
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:46,100
[calm upbeat music]

313
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,007
[Mrs. Harper]
Jacob, stay inside!

314
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,942
Hey, thanks, Mrs. Harper.

315
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,245
[laughs] No, problem.
[spray can hissing]

316
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,949
Oh, you know, you,
you really shouldn't-

317
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,952
Yep, you know, they're,
you're fine, okay.

318
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,956
Uh-huh.
[spray can hissing]

319
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,092
Just maybe not in the holes

320
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,128
- as much.
- Oh, mm hm.

321
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,496
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

322
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:21,335
[Blake] I really haven't
been outside for like weeks.

323
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,171
- Yeah, it's creepy.
- Let's just fill up

324
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,973
and get outta here.

325
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,310
All right, if I'm not
back in 10 seconds,

326
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,445
- leave.
- Godspeed.

327
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,214
[Blake exhales heavily]

328
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,550
I'm just trying not to
think about how many people

329
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,918
- have touched that pump.
- Uh, I don't wanna make

330
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,954
things worse, but also,
don't think about that guy

331
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,057
over there.
[dramatic music]

332
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,260
Oh! Is he staring at us?

333
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,962
I mean, I think he's smiling.

334
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,465
He's wearing a mask,

335
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,300
he can't be creepy, right?

336
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,903
Yeah, 'cause creepy
guys never wear masks.

337
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:59,106
[Blake groaning]

338
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,609
[ominous music]

339
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:13,487
Okay.

Ugh. [exhales heavily]

341
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,130
- Yes?
- I need a glove.

342
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,166
Uh, no gloves, I used the
last one's getting groceries,

343
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,203
but I brought some
sandwich baggies.

344

00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,417
- okay, don't touch anything!
- Hm.

349
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,422
I have an itch.

350
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,157
I'll blow on it.

351
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,960
No, it's on my butt.

352
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,364
It's in the hole. [laughs]

[sharp inhale]

354
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,103
I guess I should
get back out there.

355
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,205

- Trash bag.

[trash bag rustling]

00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,512

- It's okay.

00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,340
- It's okay.
- Ah, I'm sweating.

367
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,709
You don't know what
was on that pump,

368
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,310
it coulda been disinfectant.

369
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:48,282
It didn't need to be phlegm,
or pee, or liquid poo.

370
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,184
I didn't even think
about liquid poo!

371
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,453
You can't get Coronavirus
from liquid poo.

372
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:56,256
- You don't know that!
- I think it's hot enough,

373
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,759
it would've killed
all the germs.

374
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,662
- It's not boiling. [laughs]
- [laughs] It feels like it.

375
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,597
- It's not.
- You can't get it

376
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,132
- from in-body stuff.
- We do not know that yet,

377
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,300
- they have not done enough
- I read an article,

378
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,502
- studies yet.
- I think Fauci

379
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:10,270
- got some in poo hypothesis.
- They're trying to come up

380
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,240
with a vaccine, they're not
studying people's poo yet.

381
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,210
I'm sure proctologists are
in the room where it happens.

382
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,146
Ah, I don't even wanna
discuss this anymore.

383
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,582
Here, look, I'll
play something.

384
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:23,150
I got something nice.

- It's whale sounds.

388
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:33,193
I thought it would be soothing.

389
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,662

- Be honest,

392
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,569
- these are just fart sounds.
- No, these are whale noises.

393
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,738
- Those are farts.
- It's from a nature,

00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,106
- nature website.
- Farts are natural.

[laughs] That's a fart.

413
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,869
Maybe, maybe take
up cross-stitching.

414
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,771
No, that's for old people.

415
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,673
- I love cross-stitching.
- Well, we talked

416
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:53,307
with one of your nurses

417
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,341
and they said that it would
be safer for you to be

418
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,544
- somewhere else right now.
- Erin was planning

419
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,581
- to get you on Thursday.
- No!

420
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:02,282
I mean, I love Erin.

421
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,318
- It's okay if you don't.
- No, no.

422
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,453
I mean, I, I love Erin so much,

423
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,288
I don't have to convince myself.

424
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,357
- We know that. [laughs]
- One time she took me

425
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,261
out for the day, and
she left me in a hot car

426
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,363
- for two hours.
- Oh my gosh!

427
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,599
I still love her.

428
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:18,866
And I mean, I'm not saying

429
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,368
that I'll die if I
go home with Erin,

430
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,272
but even if I do
die... it's not murder.

431
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,207
- No, you don't-
- Although, Erin

432
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,509
doesn't have to come pick me up,

433
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:31,178
my car is just
sitting in her garage,

434
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,180
- I can drive myself.
- But your feet

435
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,282
can't push the pedals
because of your arthritis.

436
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,719
Oh, I got pretty good
at using a mop handle.

437
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,220
- It's not that hard.
- Nana, listen,

438
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,422
we're driving right now
to come and get you.

439
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,224
We're gonna bring you
back to Albuquerque.

Ah, thank you, I am so
glad you are on your way.

Well, I wasn't gonna
tell you this before,

442
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,367
but I think there's
only one nurse here.

443
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,802
- In the whole place?
- And sometimes,

444
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:57,939
I can hear her crying
in the supply closet,

445
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:02,309
begging Jesus to take the
old people instead of her.

446
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,647
So, yeah, it will be nice
to come home with you.

- Okay, we'll see you soon,

be there tomorrow.

and, and I love Erin too.

Don't tell her I told
you about the hot car.

- We won't.
- Okay.

452
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,727
- All right, love you.
- Okay, love you.

00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,699

"Why don't you meet
me down at the docks

484
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,604
Jenny was scared, this
was the baddest guy

485
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:37,872
in the whole school after all,

486
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,607
but she fired back anyway.

487
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,976
"Uh, guess what,
no, thanks, Spud!"

as he retorted,

"I said, I'll meet
you at the docks."

491
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,451
Then all of a sudden,
Jamal Anders strode in,

492
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,954
holding his trusty pet lizard.

leave her alone, Spud!"

"Hey, Jamal," Jenny said.

495
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,392
And Jamal's lizard kind
of nodded its head,

496
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,895
as if to say, "Sup."

497
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,663
Jenny was so grateful for that.

498
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:04,632
- Man, this book is terrible.
- Chapter Four.

00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,666
- It's really bad.
- Spud let go of

500
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,502
Jenny's arm and turned to Jamal.

501
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,604
"If you're so tough,
maybe you should fight me

502

tonight, Jamal!

503
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,541
If you can handle it!"

504
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:14,274
What is it with Spud

505
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,943
- and these docks?
- Chapter Five.

to my birthday party.

if Jenny and this
lizard are gonna bang.

510
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:25,352
- It's inevitable.
- There's definite heat.

511
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:29,724
There's chemistry. [laughs]

512
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:32,459
What you doin' on your phone?

513
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,763
Oh, you know, just
important feminist work.

514
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:38,733
[gasps] Ooh, are
those biceps real?

515
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:41,334
Mm hm, 100% grass-fed!

516
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:43,538
- [Blake chuckles]
- Zoom in, zoom in.

517
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,472
- Yeah, like this?
- More.

518
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:46,707
- Oh, yeah.
- More.

519
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,408
There it is, look
at those veins.

520
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,610
- [Blake laughs]
- Mm, pixelate it,

521
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:50,611
pixelate it!

522
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,547
- Even more?
- Bigger!

523
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,981
- You're filthy!
- I need it!

524
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,617
- Look how pixelated that is!
- Ah, so good!

525
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,418
Yeah, I don't even know
where he gets these biceps

526
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,655
'cause he said that he
doesn't like going to gyms.

527
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:03,724
Maybe he just like lifts
pumpkins in his backyard.

528
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,560
He does have a garden.

529
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:08,563
- Stop. That's adorable.
- I know, it's cute.

530
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:10,898
- Right?
- Or weird. [laughs]

531
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,667
Garden men could go either way.

532
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,668
- Right. Right.
- They could be like

533
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:15,503
this brawny sexpot,

534
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,504
- Mm.
- who's just one

535
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,438
- with the earth.
- [clicks] Yes.

536
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,676
- Or you get a garden gnome.
- A garden gnome.

537
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:24,946
Who just fertilizes his
rutabagas with his own poop.

538
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,514
- Oh.
- Scott's no gnome.

539
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:29,650
- He's no gnome.
- No, he's cool.

540
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:33,688
- Ooh, is he a reader?
- Yep, he likes books.

541
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:34,989
- Okay.
- He's a bookman.

542
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,791
- So he's literate.
- Mm hm.

543
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:38,659
- That's a good sign.
- He read a menu

544
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:41,896
while I was with him and I
was like, [gasps] "You too?"

545
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,899
- He passes the test.
- That's my one rule.

546
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,467
[laughs] I don't
wanna say he's perfect.

547
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,737
You can say it.
[inhales deeply]

548
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,738
- I-
- Say it.

549
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:51,772
- I can.
- Say it.

550
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:52,874
I don't want to, I said,

551
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:53,908
- I don't wanna say it.
- Say it.

552
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:56,611
- He's, he's,
- What is he?

553
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:57,845
he's p-,

554
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,948
he's perfect!
[Blake chuckles]

555
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:03,584
Maybe you should talk to him

556
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,720
instead of just like
sending one random GIF,

557
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:08,022
and then just, I
don't know, giving up.

558
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,725
I reached out, I don't wanna
be all up in his business.

559
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:11,926
- You should-
- He's got things.

560
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,694
I'm not saying call him,

561
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,596
but you can at least
explain yourself to him.

562
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,798
I can't explain a
GIF I sent a week ago,

563
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:19,967
like, "Oh, I know
you didn't respond,

564
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,836
but remember that
text I sent last week?

565
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,071
It was supposed to
be funny? [mocks]

566
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:26,607
[Blake gasps]

567
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:29,877
- Oh my gosh.
- What?

568
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:31,646
- I just sent it again.
- What?

569
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,049
The muppet GIF, I sent it
again to Scott on accident.

570
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,585
Are you serious?
[Blake groans]

571
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:38,653
Oh my gosh.
[phone ringing]

572
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:41,656
Oh, it's Jacob, ooh, I
normally wouldn't answer,

573
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,157
but it might be about the mice.

574
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,592
- Gosh.
- Now I have to find

575
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,794
another GIF to try
and explain this GIF.

576
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,996
I don't think another
GIF, just hold on.

577
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,131
- I can't send him a text.
- Don't.

578
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,632
- It has to be a GIF.
- Don't.

579
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,633
It's a proportionate

580
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:53,601
- response.
- Don't.

581
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:54,969
- Take your call.
- Do not.

582
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,705
- Hello, Jacob?
- Um, Jamie.

583
00:23:57,738 --> 00:24:00,207
Oh, it's Miss Jerikovic.

584
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:02,442
Is everything all right?

585
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:05,846
- Jacob?
- Not really.

586
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,249
Okay, just talk to me,
is it Bert and Ernie,

587
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,652
- are they all right?
- Ernie had babies?

588
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,721
Oh, oh my, um,

589
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,791
oh, Jacob, I'm so sorry.

590
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:21,629
I really thought I checked
all the right areas.

591
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:22,663
Does a mouse's look-

592
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,065
what does a mouse's look like?

593
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:27,168
- Are you asking him?
- My mom's really mad.

594
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,905
- It happened on her hands.
- Like, the birth?

595
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,740
[Jacob] She was
taking them away from me

596
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:34,709
because I was playing
with them too much,

597
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:37,078
and they all just came out.

598
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,747
- Oh, oh, Jacob, um,
- It got on her blazer

599
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,282
- and in her hair.
- tell your mom

600
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,684
- I'm really sorry.
- I'ma send him

601
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:44,585
the Ryan Reynolds

602
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,753
- face palm GIF.
- Jacob,

603
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:46,721
- who are you talking to?
- It's a good one.

604
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:48,789
- It's Jamie.
- No, it's Miss Jerikovic.

605
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:50,558
- Who?
- My teacher.

606
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,459
- Give me that!
- No, no, no, that's okay,

607
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,227
- I don't need to talk to-
- Why does my son

608
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,296
- have your number?
- I'm so sorry,

609
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,198
- he called me.
- You should not be talking

610
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:59,266
to a nine-year-old on
his personal phone.

611
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,702
When he texts
me, I never answer.

612
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:04,205
- You guys are texting?
- I don't answer.

613
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:06,741
I don't, you know, I didn't
even realize it was his phone,

614
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:08,709
I thought maybe it
was a family phone.

615
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:09,877
[Mrs. Harper] So
now you're shaming me

616
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,846
for giving my son a phone?

617
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,080
- Well, he's pretty young.
- He's only nine.

618
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,548
[Mrs. Harper] Stop
talking to my son,

619
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,617
we are already doing
you a massive favor.

620
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,719
You know what? You can just
put the mice back in the cage,

621
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,187
you don't even have
to look at them.

622
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,556
Just leave 'em there,
and I will fix everything

623
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,759
- when I come back.
- Have you ever smelled

624
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:27,294
- mouse afterbirth?
- I have not.

625
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:32,633
Well, you will.
[phone beeps]

626
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:36,670
What? I think she's gonna
get that other mouse pregnant.

627
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:41,709
- Something's happened.
- What have you done?

628
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:44,145
- I sent the GIF again.
- Blake!

629
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:46,147
I think it's like permanently
copied to my clipboard

630
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,783
- or something.
- It's still in the text box,

631
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:51,585
- you don't have to press send.
- I just, I was distracted,

632
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,154
it's not every day that
your sister gets accused

633
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,623
- of being a pedophile.
- She didn't say pedophile,

634
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:56,757
I don't think it's the same

635
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:57,625
- over text.
- I sent it again!

636
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:58,559
Why are you still
talking to him?

637
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:01,762
I thought I copied
the right GIF this time!

638
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,998
Maybe you should just
send him actual words.

639
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:05,199
I can't do that,

640
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:06,700
- I'll look like a fool.
- You already look

641
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:07,868
like a fool, oh.

642
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:12,673
- What?
- I started my period.

643
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:15,109
Was it all the
yelling? The diaphragm

644
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:18,946
- sometimes gooshes the blood.
- Yeah, I exerted myself.

645
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,982
Okay.
[calm upbeat music]

646
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:23,084
I figured out what to do

647
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,919
- about your period.
- Yeah?

648
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,690
- It's all natural.
- Oh, I love that.

649
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:32,193
And I suggest that
you insert this side.

650
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:34,028
- Oh.
- This is for holding,

651
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:37,231
this is, it's a
four-pronged approach.

652
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,400
- Look how friendly it looks.
- [laughs] Look at that,

653
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,168
- just mm.
- Mm.

654
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:43,104
- Yes.
- And I found a cork

655
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,905
in the gutter over there,
you can use that too,

656
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:46,941
- there's lots of options.
- That's great,

657
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,409
I'll do that right
after I'm done bleeding

658
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,244
- through these sticks.
- For real though,

659
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:51,912
- what did you do?
- Uh, I just grabbed

660
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:54,915
- some wipes.
- Made a pad?

661
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:56,817
No, I just stuck it in.

662
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,921
You stuck it in?

663
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,957
Yeah, that's what I do
when I don't have a tampon.

664
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,925
I usually get some
toilet paper and-

665
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,027
- You can't do that,
you can't just shove

666
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,395
- stuff up there.
- Yeah, you can.

667
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,731
No, it's like specific,
protected cotton

668
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,800
in the applicators, you, you,

669
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,769
I bet you have like flecks
of dissolved TP up there

670
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:17,805
- from like 2007.
- No, I was doing it

671
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:18,906
way before '07.

672
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,810
Whoa, I bet you're
gonna give birth

673
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:26,147
to just like a matted
TP baby someday.

674
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,848
It's been like 15 years,

675
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,717
I think it woulda
happened already.

676
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,685
What's the gestation

677
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,987
- for a TP baby?
- I don't know,

678
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,956
- 30, 40 years of TP flecks.
- Ugh,

679
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,326
I gotta figure out how to fix
this thing with Mrs. Harper.

680
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,163
What do you mean?
You can't unbirth mice.

681
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:45,733
No, I know, I, but
I can do something,

682
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,835
maybe not now, but later.

683
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,337
Like you're gonna put the
mice back in when you get back?

684
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,976
- Are you thinking about it?
- No.

685
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,945
No, you're right, you
can't unbirth mice.

686
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,180
Mm mm, no, sir.

687
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:02,183
What's done is done, lady.

688
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:05,085
But there's always
something you can do.

- What?
- Nana's gonna die

690

- Deal-breaker or no?
- Are they cooked?

- Yes, how warm he is.
- What is, what is

705
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:45,226
the internal temperature
of this meat? [laughs]

706

Okay, I'll say, it's like,
you know, its body warm,

707
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:49,430
- so it would cool down.
- Is it seasoned,

708

- like are these hams sticky?
- Yes, honey-baked.

That's a deal breaker for me.

It's not a deal
breaker for me.

714
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:01,909
I'm just saying, if he has
a great sense of humor,

715
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:03,077
he can carry it off.

716
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,012
He'd be like, "Hi, I'm Bob,

717
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:06,981
and I got rotisserie
chickens for hands,"

718

- I don't think-

- He'd be like
- The novelty

720

- Bob the chicken hand guy.
- would wear off.

721
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:11,919
You'd probably cheat
on him with someone

00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:13,187
with a regular butt.

not, I would never,

- Sweet cheeks?

00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,397
His are literally honey-baked.

727
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,466
I would never call ham sweet.

728
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:27,801
- It is sweet.
- It's a savory treat.

729

730
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,372

- And there's contact?
- Like full-on,

00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:49,823
like his cheeks have to
be kind of like smushed

- Anytime

740
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:56,130
- It's a deal-breaker because
- he went to the

741
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:56,964
- grocery store.
- it's actual

742
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,832
sexual harassment,

743
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,602

- It's like Tourette's,

- deal-breaker.
- against him if

- you didn't.
- What, and it's not

749
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:09,476
a deal-breaker for you?

750
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:11,011
No, it's a
deal-breaker for me.

He's perfect, he
never farts on you.

- No such man exists.
- But he sweats hot dog water.

756
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:27,261
[laughs] Not a deal-breaker.

757
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:28,962
- Not a deal-breaker?
- No, it's not

758
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,598
a deal-breaker because if he
thought it was kind of funny,

759
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:32,299
I think it would be something
we could laugh about.

you worked out together,

would it make you gag?

00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,471
No, I mean it's hot dog water.

[laughs] I like ham,
I like hot dogs.

it's not a good picture.

feels, that's horrible.

do it to someone else.

not gonna pick it up.

think of a single better way

842
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:13,320
to just tell me
you didn't like me?

843
00:34:13,353 --> 00:34:14,589
Well, we don't know that.

844
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:17,291
I mean, he did send you
a picture of his penis.

845
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:18,392
It was clearly an accident.

846
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:21,295
It was not a flattering picture.

847
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,099
Are you okay?

848
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:31,371
I'm okay.

849
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:36,310
I mean, clearly, like
he picked up his phone

850
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:38,312
after he told me he was dead,

851
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:40,615
- so he's an idiot.
- Yeah.

852
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:43,818
But... I feel really stupid.

853
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:46,688
You do not need
to feel stupid.

854
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:49,256
Well, it's just that I,

855
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,492
[laughs] I liked that
giant pile of crap.

856
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:55,262
So. Hm. [laughs]

857
00:34:55,295 --> 00:35:00,233
Blake, baby, we're going 90.
[Blake screams]

858
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:04,471
[Blake yells]

859
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:07,374
[Blake screams]

860
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:18,452
Is that four La Croixs?
[Blake burps]

861
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:20,320
- Hard day, baby.
- Yeah.

862
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:24,491
[Blake yells]
[foot thuds]

863
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,426
Don't kick the car, it's not,

864
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,228
it's not her fault!

865
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:31,365
Stop.
[phone ringing]

866
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:32,466
I'll be back.

867
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:39,507
- Nana!
- Jaybird, what's up,

868
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,710
- chicken butt? [laughs]
- [laughs] Hey, Nana.

869
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,478
I really miss you.

870
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,581
I miss you girls, too.

871
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:48,448
- How's Blake?
- Uh, she,

872
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,519
[cans clanking]

873
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:52,720
[Blake screams]

874
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:57,324
I mean, she's, uh,
she's not great.

875
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:58,960
Well, how are you, sweetheart?

876
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:01,596
Me? Oh, I'm fine.

877
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:04,932
- Mm hm.
- I am fine.

878
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,968
- Okay.
- I just,

879
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:09,403
I can't wait to see you.

880
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:12,439
It'll feel like some
part of all this isn't,

881
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:14,341
you know, just the worst.
[furniture clattering]

882
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:18,412
Well, you always
land on your feet,

883
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:21,783
- sweetheart, you always do.
- What are you doing?

884
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,686
[Nana] I can't talk
long, my battery is going.

885
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,922
[Fred] Hello.

886
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,657
[Blake] Is that Nana?

887
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:32,392
- Nana, who is that?
- Oh, that's Fred,

888
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:35,963
he's trying to get into
my room, but he's got it.

889
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,465
- Got what?
- You know,

890
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:41,234
the Corona.
[suspenseful music]

891
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,804
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

892
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:45,540
Nana, why does Fred
wanna get into your room?

893
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:48,810
'Cause this is time
of night that he...

894
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,014
- Nana!
- Ugh.

895
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,749
He finds a great deal
of comfort in his routine,

896
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:57,552
and so do I.
[Fred singing]

897
00:36:57,585 --> 00:37:00,588
Oh my gosh, I think
Fred's the Raven.

898
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,023
- What?
- It's a thing,

899
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,223
you know, like the
guy in nursing homes

900
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:07,995
that goes around to all the
ladies and keeps them satisfied.

901
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:10,430
Nana, do not let Fred in!

902
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,633
I am so excited about
seeing you, girls,

903
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:16,470
and I'm ready to start a
whole new chapter in my life.

904
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:19,640
- I want Bruce with me.
- I thought his name was Fred?

905
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:23,745
- No, Bruce, my dog.
- Um, that seems-

906
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:26,681
- Hello, Judith.
- Fred!

907
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:28,348
Why is he calling you Judith?

908
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:29,449
They're all Judith to him.

909
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:33,420
I want you to go to your
sister's and get my dog,

910
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:35,422
I need a familiar face.

911
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,825
- We're familiar faces!
- Can you call a nurse?

912
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,427
Fred is literally
scratching at your walls.

913
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,496
I think all the nurses have
gone home, I mean, this place

914
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,766
- is like a free-for-all.
- What?

915
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:47,568
♪ My lips may say ♪

916
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,003
What is this creepy song?

917
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:51,572
- I don't know!
- Okay, okay!

918
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,442
I love you, bring my dog

919
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,744
or I'm n-
[phone chimes]

920
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:58,613
- Ugh!
- Nana! Ugh!

921
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:59,814
I think her battery died.

922
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,550
The nurses can't all be gone,
she might've been confused.

923
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,318
And now she's canoodling
with a sick Raven.

924
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,521
We don't know he was a Raven,

925
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:09,524
he could've been an
exclusive booty caller.

926
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,391
She's just so pure.
[dial tone humming]

927
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:14,095
- She doesn't even say fart.
- I know, she says, oops,

928
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,495
- I popped my bottom.
- Popped my bottom,

929
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,464
- it is so much worse.
- Hello,

930
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:19,000
this is Nurse Ackerman,
how can I help you?

931
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,835
Nurse Ackerman, we're
so glad you're there.

932
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,504
So we were on the phone
with our grandma just now,

933
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:26,473
and there was a man with COVID
trying to get into her room.

934
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:28,009
Ugh, Fred, I shouldn't
be saying this,

935
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,342
but I hope he's the next to go.

936
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,380
Hold please.
[calm upbeat music]

937
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:44,659
This hold music
actually slaps.

938
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:47,995
- Ooh, oh, Willowbrook.
- Okay.

939
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:53,868
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.
- Yeah, okay.

940
00:38:56,871 --> 00:38:58,673
- Ooh.
- What is this?

941
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:02,043
This just took it
to a whole new level.

942
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:05,046
Oh my gosh, I'm seeing stars.

943
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,480
- Woo!
- Ooh, hello,

944
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,851
- Make-A-Wish Foundation?
- Dora.

945
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:13,054
- I would like to make a wish.
- Dora, give me the phone.

946
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:15,122
Okay, we've barred Fred's door.

947
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:16,691
[Blake exhales sharply]
Hey, Jeanine, move them

948
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,492
to the porch, the freezer
truck's coming tonight.

949
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,529
Wait, I have a note
from your grandma.

950
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:24,732
- You do?
- It says, "Dolphin Testicle 89."

951
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,535
She said you'd understand
what that meant.

952
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:28,603
- Um.
- No.

953
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,539
- I don't think we do.
- We don't.

954
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,174
- Paula Jenkins?
- Oh, no, our grandmother's

955
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,810
- Paulina Jerikovic.
- Oh, she has a note here too.

956
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:39,446
It says, "If I die here,
please bury me with my dog."

957
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,583
- But her dog's still alive.
- That's not my problem.

958
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:43,684
Okay, well, thank you

959
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:44,952
- so much.
- Jeanine,

960
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:47,188
- is this poop or blood?
- It's poop and blood.

961
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,456
Could you also please
just keep that Raven away

962
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,691
- from our grandma?
- Don't worry,

963
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:52,760
- Raymond's dead.
- Who's Raymond?

964
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:55,462
I gotta go.
[phone beeps]

965
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:57,430
- [Blake exhales sharply]
- She's okay,

966
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:58,633
they're taking care of Fred,

967
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,534
and we are gonna
go get this dog.

968
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:01,736
You're saying it's okay,

969
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:06,607
but we really don't know if
anything is okay at all anymore.

970
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,441
- Shh.
- Thank you.

971
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,878
Oh, that calms me
so, that's so nice.

972
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,647
Oh!
[Erin laughing]

973
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,115
Hey, you guys, hold on,

974
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:17,718
I'm watching, I'm watching
"Bad Moms Christmas." [laughs]

975
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:21,155
Oh.
[Erin laughs hysterically]

976
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,190
[Actor] Put that down!

977
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,628
- Sorry, hi, hi.
- Hey, Erin.

978
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:31,666
We've all just been quarantined
in our rooms right now.

979
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,567
Does someone on
the ship have it?

980
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:36,971
Well, there's no tests
on board, so, technically,

981
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:38,873
- no one has it.
- That's,

982
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,875
- is, is anyone sick?
- Well, there's a lot

983
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:43,476
of people coughing, but
only a few people dying.

984
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:45,713
But, I mean, when does that
not happen on a cruise?

985
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,114
I ask you, hm, come on,

986
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:48,783
- motion of the ocean.
- Erin, you need

987
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:51,619
to try to get off that
cruise as soon as possible.

988
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:52,920
Uh, and waste my Groupon?

989
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:54,689
- I don't think so.
- Okay, um,

990
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,724
we're on our way to
go and get Nana and-

991
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,793
- You guys are on a
road trip without me?

992
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:00,928
Ugh, well, now I
regret this cruise.

993
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:02,797
Nana asked us
to pick up Bruce.

994
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,532
- Is he at your place?
- No,

995
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:05,533
but there's a
really funny story.

996
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:07,702
So this the whole cruise
thing happened so fast,

997
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,537
I was really stressed about
what to do with Bruce.

998
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,972
And so I'm at Trader
Joe's and I'm in line,

999
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,207
and I'm complaining to just
like anybody that would listen.

1000
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,643
And this guy just walked
up and saved my life,

1001
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,678
and offered to take Bruce.

1002
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:22,683
So you gave Nana's dog to
a stranger during a pandemic.

1003
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:24,819
Gorb is not a stranger.

1004
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:27,288
He told me all
about his mom's MS.

1005
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,856
And he is the strongest
person that I know.

1006
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,858
- His name is Gorb?
- It's Gorb,

1007
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:33,127
or Lorb, or something,

everything he was saying

with the mask on, but
I have his address

1010
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:37,999

drop off the dog,

I feel so bad that
she's being so stupid.

1025

She's young, she's healthy.

1026

If she can survive
Jefferson's childbirth,

1027
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,630
- she can survive anything.
- So help me,

one more detail

- Jefferson's childbirth.
- about her vaginal wall.

1030
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:16,771

- Hole to hole, baby.

some credit though,

- Gorb, there he is.

1036
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:30,785
He's actually not
too far out of the way,

1037
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,686
he's pretty close to Erin's,

1038
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,588
which means he's on
the way to Nana's.

1039

We can just swing
by and get the dog.

Wait, no, no, we
don't know who Gorb is,

Are we seriously gonna go
to this stranger's house

1043
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,799
and hope he doesn't have COVID.

1044
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,600
And hope he didn't eat Bruce.

1045
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,803
You know, Nana, she's
not gonna get in this car

1046
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:50,771
- without her dog.
- Well, we can't

1047

we go there and get it.

What did he say?

1058
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:20,334
He asked for
your Hulu password.

1059
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,173
- Are you serious?
- He's clearly a douche bag.

1060

You are so much better than him.

really amazing day, Jamal."

with Jamal's lizard,

and they seemed to
understand each other.

Then a loud scream
echoed in the distance.

see Spud sprinting toward them.

out of his lunch bag!

- A lotta people

have been taking alcohol and
turning it into hand sanitizer,

1332
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:04,457
but I took some Dial and
fermented it into wine.

sanitizer too, if you want.

01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:09,410
- COVID.
- You folks

1519
01:05:09,443 --> 01:05:12,379
- having car trouble?
- We're figuring it out.

1520
01:05:12,413 --> 01:05:14,682
- Thanks.
- We are so close.

1521
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:16,551
We're only 30 minutes
away from Nana.

1522
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:19,286
Not if we walk,
it's like three hours,

1523
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:22,055
plus a two month walk
back to Albuquerque

1524
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,323
with a senior citizen.

1525
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:25,159
[Evan] You can borrow
my Uncle Gene's car!

1526
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:27,494
Uh, we probably
shouldn't get in your car.

1527
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:30,632
Ah, man, we can't use any
cars. We can't take a bus,

1528
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:32,366
we can't call an Uber.

1529
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:35,102
There is no way for
us to get to her.

1530
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:36,503
What about Nana's car?

1531
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:38,573
It's at Erin's house,
there's no one there.

1532
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,174
That's at least a little closer.

1533
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:42,075
- Yeah.
- Wanna borrow

1534
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,477
my rollerblades?

1535
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:45,045
I got some more.

1536
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:49,950
- Okay.
- All right!

1537
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,322
[spirited music]

1538
01:05:57,124 --> 01:06:00,628
- We're doing it!
- It's actually really nice.

1539
01:06:02,162 --> 01:06:02,996
Woo.

1540
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,733
- Get the- Bruce!
- Heel, Bruce.

1541
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,071
Huh!

1542
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:15,677
- Bruce!
- Oh my gosh.

1543
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:18,245
[Blake sighs]

1544
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:37,331
- Blake!
- Ah!

1545
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,167
- We made it.
- Yeah,

1546
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,368
we just gotta grab the car.

1547
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:44,304
- Be at Nana's in 20?
- Okay. [pants]

1548
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,373
Wow, there are a lotta
cars on Erin's street.

1549
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:48,743
Is someone having a party?

1550
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:52,079
[upbeat music]

1551
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:53,146
- Ooh.
- Hey, the Chickorakies

1552
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,314
are here, guys.

1553
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:56,584
- Hey, you guys made it!
- What?

1554
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:59,721
- You wanna get a burger?
- It's Erin's house.

1555
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:02,489
[dramatic music]

1556
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:19,072
- You guys want something?
- Doug, why are you home?

1557
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:20,642
They docked us
early, you didn't hear?

1558
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:22,409
Most of the other
passengers are on board,

1559
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:25,547
but they let us off
'cause we're rich.

1560
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,849
- Oh my gosh.
- Well, it's not personal,

1561
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:31,351
we're just, we're more
valuable, wink. [chuckles]

1562
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:34,288
So any who, all these guys
were having a good time

1563
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:37,224
on the boat, we figured,
let's bring the boat here.

1564
01:07:37,257 --> 01:07:40,294
- Am I right guys? [chuckles]
- Woo!

1565
01:07:40,327 --> 01:07:41,796
I don't know half
of these people.

1566
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,330
These are all
your cruise people?

1567
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:45,499
Isn't that crazy? [sneezes]

1568
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:46,768
- Ugh.
- Oh, man,

1569
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:48,235
we'll just cook that
one a little longer.

1570
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:49,403
Maybe give it to one
of the older people.

1571
01:07:49,436 --> 01:07:52,306
- Doug, where's Erin?
- She, uh,

1572
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:55,475
went to get your grandma.
[suspenseful music]

1573
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,678
Where are Nana's keys?

1574
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:58,513
They're just in the
glove compartment.

1575
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:00,414
Hey, we'll see you guys later.

1576
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:02,650
Who wants to play
some suck and blow?

1577
01:08:02,684 --> 01:08:03,851
C'mon Bruce!

1578
01:08:08,556 --> 01:08:10,324
Oh, you're heavy, okay.

1579
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,295
- Don't touch that!
- Okay.

1580
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:17,264
- Okay.
- Oh, gosh,

1581
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:19,166
this is full of
after dinner mints.

1582
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,636
They're not even wrapped!

1583
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:22,604
[car engine revs]

1584
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:23,738
- Woo!
- Woo!

1585
01:08:23,771 --> 01:08:27,341
[upbeat suspenseful music]

1586
01:08:30,377 --> 01:08:32,212
What do we do?

1587
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:35,449
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, you're in town.

1588
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,284
Oh, did Doug ruin my surprise?

1589
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:38,886
Look, I'm picking
up Nana right now,

1590
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,788
and I thought we could just
all hang out together tonight,

1591
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:42,790
- like a girls' night.
- No, no, Erin,

1592
01:08:42,824 --> 01:08:45,292
uh, just let us grab Nana,
we're already on our way.

1593
01:08:45,325 --> 01:08:46,928
Oh, stop it, I'm
like two minutes away.

1594
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:49,329
- Can you go any faster?
- No, I'm flooring it,

1595
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:50,464
this thing is so old.

1596
01:08:50,497 --> 01:08:51,799
[phone ringing]

1597
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,868
Erin, um, I don't mean
to be rude or anything,

1598
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:56,470
but I really think you
should stay away from Nana,

1599
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:57,805
especially 'cause you've
been around people

1600
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,841
- who have Coronavirus.
- We don't know that

1601
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:01,308
that's what those
people died of.

1602
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:02,910
A lot of the people in the pile,

1603
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:05,345
looked like they had a lot
of other problems going on.

1604
01:09:05,379 --> 01:09:06,848
Okay, whatever, you've
been around people

1605
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,850
who may have had Coronavirus,

1606
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:10,785
either way, Nana's high risk,

1607
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:13,253
I really think you need
to stay away from her!

1608
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:14,254
Yeah, just let
us do it, please.

1609
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:16,423
It's sweet how worried
you guys are about Nana,

1610
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:18,458
but it's making you so anxious.

1611
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:21,428
She's gonna be fine, this
pandemic is not a big deal,

1612
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:22,229
- really.
- Have you been watching

1613
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:23,898
- the news?
- They're just trying

1614
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:26,433
to make us scared, I'm not
gonna live my life like that.

1615
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:28,335
Thousands of people are dying!

1616
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:30,605
People die in cars,
people die from the flu.

1617
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:32,807
People get eaten by crocodiles.

1618
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,542
What, they're gonna
cancel the NBA

1619
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:37,512
because somebody gets
eaten by a crocodile?

1620
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:39,212
Stop touching your face, Erin!

1621
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:40,782
I know, it totally
makes me break out.

1622
01:09:40,815 --> 01:09:42,784
- She is impossible!
- I'm here.

1623
01:09:42,817 --> 01:09:44,418
I'll call you guys
after I get Nana.

1624
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:48,422
No, Erin! Um, tell us about
Jefferson's birth story.

1625
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:50,490
- Now?
- Mm hm, yeah.

1626
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:53,226
Uh, you're right,
we're so anxious,

1627
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,328
and maybe a story would help.

1628
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,431
I don't think you've
told me about it yet.

1629
01:09:57,464 --> 01:09:58,533
Okay, but we need
to start with my birth

1630
01:09:58,566 --> 01:10:00,802
because really that's how
this whole thing begins.

1631
01:10:00,835 --> 01:10:02,537
So I was a high-risk birth

1632
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,939
because I pooped so
much in the womb,

1633
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:07,307
the doctor thought I
would choke on it and die.

1634
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,976
McKenzie comes running
in and she's like,

1635
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:13,480
"What's a mucus plug?"
[laughs hysterically]

1636
01:10:13,514 --> 01:10:14,916
And my water broke.

1637
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:17,250
And the sad thing is
like, it was a mini dress,

1638
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:19,486
so it just. [imitates explosion]

1639
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,354
The bride was really
cool about it after.

1640
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:23,390
And the doctor comes
in and he said,

1641
01:10:23,423 --> 01:10:26,027
"You have the
strongest vaginal wall

1642
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,662
- I've ever seen."
- I can't.

1643
01:10:27,695 --> 01:10:28,896
- I can't.
- And I said.

1644
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,531
And his feet came out,
they were just kicking.

1645
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:32,533
And one of the nurses
said, "He's breech."

1646
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:35,737
And in, in my mind, I just
said, "Jefferson, baby,

1647
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,539
your breech," and it was
just kind of like everything

1648
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:40,273
went sort of quiet.

1649
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:41,909
And he just like scurried
right back up in there.

1650
01:10:41,943 --> 01:10:46,748
And he just like spun around
and came out head first.

1651
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:48,850
Like we just
understood each other.

1652
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:51,519
And once they like
wiped all the poop

1653
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:52,920
from his beautiful little face,

1654
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:55,422
they just handed me an angel.

1655
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:56,924
I thought, I'm just a vessel.

1656
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,660
But I don't know if everything
like went back together

1657
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:00,895
the way that it's supposed to,

1658
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,797
but we just like
carefully scraped it off

1659
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:05,867
and put it in a jar, and
I use it as night cream.

1660
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,367
That's her Escalade, right?

1661
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,569
We should have her
meet us somewhere

1662
01:11:08,603 --> 01:11:09,804
to talk about her and
Doug's first time.

1663
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:11,973
Ugh, let's have her
meet us at Denny's.

1664
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,841
- Denny's isn't open.
- She doesn't care.

1665
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:15,042
I'm gonna go get her, I'll
call you guy later, bye!

1666
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:16,878
- Erin, Erin!
- No, no, no, no!

1667
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:18,411
[gasps] She's getting out!

1668
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:20,447
She's going inside!

1669
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,949
Take care of
Nana for me, Jamie.

1670
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:23,551
No, no, no, Blake,
what are you doing?

1671
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:24,585
There's always
something you can do.

1672
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,453
[ethereal music]

1673
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:27,688
No, no, no, Blake!

1674
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:29,857
No, she'll infect you!

1675
01:11:29,891 --> 01:11:31,424
Ow, Blake!

01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,830
Go, Jamie, go!
[Erin groaning]

1678
01:11:35,863 --> 01:11:39,667
Just stay, just
stay, just stay down!

1679
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,502
- You're on my finger!
- Erin!

1680
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:43,938
- Ah.
- Stop!

1681
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:44,872
- Hi.
- Stop it!

1682
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:45,840
Sorry, I missed you.

1683
01:11:45,873 --> 01:11:48,009
Um, I'm actually right outside.

1684
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,911
- No, just, okay, okay.
- It is really good

1685
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:51,646
- to see you though.
- It's good to see you too.

1686
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,881
- Okay, now get off of me.
- Stop struggling!

1687
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:56,617
[grunts] All right, let's-

1688
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:57,450
- Just stay down!

1689
01:11:57,484 --> 01:12:00,555
- Hey!
- I love you, but stay down.

1690
01:12:00,588 --> 01:12:02,657
Oh, hey, Jamie.

1691
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,758
Oh, I love your pink hair.

1692
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:06,393
I mean, you're roots,
obviously, need to be done,

1693
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:10,598
but I bet it was really
cute when you first did it.

1694
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:11,899
What's wrong?

1695
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:14,869
Nana's dead.

1696
01:12:16,704 --> 01:12:18,039
- Oh, Jamie.
- Don't touch her,

1697
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,674
don't touch her.

1698
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:20,808
I don't understand, we
just, we just talked to her

1699
01:12:20,842 --> 01:12:22,643
and she was fine.

1700
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:25,146
Apparently, it
was really sudden,

1701
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:28,015
um, she was fine this morning,

1702
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:30,618
and, uh, then her
heart gave out.

1703
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:32,854
- Oh, no.
- No, no,

1704
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,889
she's just inside though.

1705
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:36,924
We just, we got
all the way here,

1706
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,659
we just have to go
and get her, right?

1707
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:43,531
I just, having a really
hard time breathing right now.

1708
01:12:43,564 --> 01:12:46,534
I'm just, um,
really, really hot.

1709
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:48,636
- [wheezing] I can't,
- Jamie?

1710
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:50,671
- I can't breathe.
- Jamie, whoa, whoa.

1711
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:51,839
- Jamie!
- Jamie!

1712
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:54,642
- Where are you going?
- I'm too hot!

1713
01:12:54,675 --> 01:12:56,043
Jamie, just slow
down a minute.

1714
01:12:57,178 --> 01:12:59,513
[spirited music]

1715
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:04,919
- Ugh, she's going so fast!
- She is in such great shape.

1716
01:13:08,455 --> 01:13:12,693
Oh my gosh, we
lost her. [panting]

1717
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:15,663
[Erin screams]
[screams] Dead body!

1718
01:13:15,696 --> 01:13:17,665
Oh, oh, don't look,
don't look at it!

1719
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:21,468
It's just me.
[Jamie and Erin panting]

1720
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:29,476
Hey, baby, you
lost your pants.

1721
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:32,813
They were too chafey.

1722
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:35,116
Yeah.

1723
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:41,656
I don't think I
can do this. [crying]

1724
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:45,726
I'm sorry I can't
hug you. [crying]

1725
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,765
[Jamie crying]
[gentle music]

1726
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:14,155
Oh, that's nice, thanks.

1727
01:14:16,824 --> 01:14:20,761
[Jamie breathes deeply]

1728
01:14:24,732 --> 01:14:27,702
[birds chirping]

1729
01:14:33,274 --> 01:14:34,608
- [Erin sneezes]
- Ew!

1730
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,610
- Ew, wear a mask!
- Come on!

1731
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:38,713
Oh, calm down,
they don't even work.

1732
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:44,085
[Blake] Dude, I don't think
we're gonna find your pants.

1733
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:47,755
- Did you bury them?
- No, I didn't bury my pants,

1734
01:14:47,788 --> 01:14:50,925
Erin.
[phone ringing]

1735
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:53,294
[gasps] This way. I
have ears like a bat.

1736
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:55,229
It happens in motherhood.

1737
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:56,964
Boom, there they are!

1738
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:59,200
Wow, you really
flung those bad boys.

1739
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,868
I'm way impressed.

1740
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:03,771
[phone ringing]

1741
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,579
- Mrs. Harper.
- You do not need

1742
01:15:11,612 --> 01:15:13,781
- to answer that right now.
- Hello?

1743
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:16,717
- Hi, Miss Jerikovic, Jamie.
- Yes?

1744
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:19,954
[Mrs. Harper] It's
Ainsley Harper, I, um,

1745
01:15:19,987 --> 01:15:23,991
I wanted to apologize for
being so hard on you earlier.

1746
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:26,227
I went through
Jacob's phone and, um,

1747
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,963
there are a lot of much
older women in his contacts.

1748
01:15:28,996 --> 01:15:31,932
- I mean, I'm not that old.
- He's been texting

1749
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:34,902
the babysitter, the
widow across our street,

1750
01:15:34,935 --> 01:15:38,105
my gynecologist. I
just feel terrible.

1751
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:43,077
Ugh, I have a lot of rage
and I usually blow off steam

1752
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,779
by shooting guns
out of my sunroof,

1753
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:46,747
but with the kids
not being in school,

1754
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,716
I just haven't had
that me time, you know?

1755
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:50,885
- Sure.
- And Jacob is just friendly,

1756
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:52,987
- he's not a weirdo.
- You know, he's actually

1757
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,656
a really nice kid, Mrs. Harper,

1758
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:58,692
very emotionally in tune.
[Mrs. Harper laughs]

1759
01:15:58,726 --> 01:15:59,627
[Mrs. Harper] Well,
I'm not gonna call

1760
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,828
Principal Belnap or anything.

1761
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:03,264
I mean, I'm still not very happy
about the dead mice babies,

1762
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:04,932
- What the hell?
- but I'm just too tired

1763
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:07,268
to argue about that right now.

1764
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,370
- Hang in there, Ainsley.
- I'm still gonna need

1765
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:11,305
you to pay for my
damaged blazer though.

1766
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:14,208
- It just wasn't right.
- Sure, absolutely.

1767
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:18,879
Okay, thank you so much.
[phone beeps]

1768
01:16:18,913 --> 01:16:20,281
Hey, that's good.

1769
01:16:31,192 --> 01:16:32,726
No, Erin, neither of us

1770
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,295
- is dating anyone.
- I was just asking.

1771
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:36,363
There's just, there's a
pandemic happening right now,

1772
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:37,865
- I mean, for some.
- so it's kinda hard.

1773
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:38,899
- [Jamie gasps]
- But you don't understand,

1774
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:40,301
this is my car!

1775
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:43,137
I can't just have you
getting into a random car.

1776
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:45,873
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh, Nana!

1777
01:16:45,906 --> 01:16:49,643
Jaybird, will you
please tell Nurse Ackerman

1778
01:16:49,677 --> 01:16:52,947
that this is my car and my dog.

1779
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,716
- Nana!
- Oh, oh-oh, baby.

1780
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:58,953
- [laughs] Oh my!
- [gasps] Oh.

1781
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:02,089
I don't understand,
they told me you died.

1782
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:04,925
Ugh, I am so sorry,

1783
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,760
Dora has been messing
with our files,

1784
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:09,763
- it's been a nightmare.
- Okay, okay,

1785
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:11,699
yeah, can we just
get our Nana home?

1786
01:17:11,732 --> 01:17:13,134
Yes, I will go get
the release forms.

1787
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:17,204
- Okay, okay.
- Babycakes!

1788
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:19,306
Hi, Nana, I'm sorry,
we can't get close,

1789
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,941
Erin and I got exposed.

1790
01:17:20,975 --> 01:17:24,011
- Hi, Nan.
- Hi, Erin.

1791
01:17:26,947 --> 01:17:28,382
- Wha...
- We did it.

1792
01:17:28,415 --> 01:17:30,784
- Yes, we did!
- Mm!

1793
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:35,956
- Mm.

- Doctor, don't.
- Oh, my.

1797
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:45,900
- [Blake screams]

1798
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:47,001
I'll see you in
a couple weeks.

1799
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:48,335
I'll take good care of her.

1800
