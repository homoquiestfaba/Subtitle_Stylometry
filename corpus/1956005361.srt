00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:28,865
- Where the...
- Where it should be.

12
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,609
- It's supposed to be right here.
- No, it's not.

13
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:33,746
Yeah, I left it in the kitchen.

14
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,688
Curtis, where in the kitchen?

15
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,896
- On the table.
- Right.

16
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:42,591
And is it supposed to
be on the table, baby?

17
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:44,410
Don't do that.

18
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:46,824
What... what am I doing?

19
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,410
Talking to me like I'm a child.

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,269
- Well, Curtis...
- Don't do that.

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,665
Leaving your little toys around
on the table is like a child.

22
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,977
They're not toys. They're tools.

23
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,438
And this is my work, bitch.

24
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:04,570
What'd you s...

25
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:07,732
This your work what?

26
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,639
My workbench.

27
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:13,904
Curtis, this is my kitchen table,

28
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,977
- not your work table.
- You don't know what the hell it is.

29
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:21,555
So, you did move it.

30
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,035
Well, Curtis, it shouldn't
have been right here.

31
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:26,895
- Where'd you put it?
- Where does it belong?

32
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,538
It belongs wherever the
hell I put it, woman.

33
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:31,555
Now, this is my house, Ella.

34
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,341
Okay, "my house... okay, my house."

35
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,520
Well, that's your garage out there, too.

36
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:40,159
So, you put it in the garage?
Why'd you put it in the garage?

37
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,250
Curtis, that's where tools go, tool.

38
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:45,708
Well, you need to go get it.

39
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:49,627
Curtis, do you know how
heavy that stuff was?

40
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,416
Why would I go get it and
bring it back in here?

41
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,868
How did you move it?

42
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,710
Me and the kids moved it.

43
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:00,077
Then "me and the kids" mean

44
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,336
"you need to go get it and
bring it back in here."

45
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:07,491
Baby, please, just go... go to
the garage, honey, just go.

46
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:09,319
Baby, you the one that put 'em in there.

47
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,603
Curtis, listen to me...

48
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:13,627
I am not playing with you.

49
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:14,861
Rrr!

50
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,875
Baby, I got to fix this stuff.

51
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,766
I got to fix this stuff

52
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:22,431
so I can open up the laundromat in...

53
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:24,142
tomorrow, whenever I'm opening it up.

54
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,056
- Curtis.
- What?

55
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:29,852
I have heard this for months.

56
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:31,559
That's 'cause it's true, baby.

57
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,629
You need to hire somebody, baby.

58
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:37,955
With what, Ella, my...

59
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:40,590
my amazing looks and
my gorgeous physique?

60
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,754
Curtis, baby, just go to the bank,

61
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,814
try to get a loan.

62
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:49,932
Ella, I didn't move
down here to do a loan.

63
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:50,986
I'm not doing a loan.

64
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,739
Didn't your pastor say,
"no loan, no debt" this year?

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,934
No debt... I'm not doing debt.

66
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,613
Well, if you're not doing any debt,

67
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,262
then we won't be opening this year.

68
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,472
Why can't you believe in me?

69
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,167
Curtis... because I know you.

70
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,089
You know what?

71
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:13,646
Curtis, when have you
fixed anything ever?

72
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,987
Are you serious right now?

73
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,967
I-I fix stuff all the time, Ella.

74
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,827
C-Curtis, all the time
we were in Atlanta,

75
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,743
you never... you never fixed nothing.

76
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,423
I fixed the stove.

77
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:29,598
And it never worked again.

78
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:32,670
I fix... I fixed...

79
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:35,030
Nothing, baby, nothing... nothing.

80
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,254
You fixed nothing.

81
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,685
I fixed you when I... [MUTTERS]

82
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:45,997
You really don't think
I can do this, do you?

83
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,447
Go on and say it.

84
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,910
Did you see that? I can't be...

85
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,210
I can't believe you asked me that.

86
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,011
No, baby, I don't.
No, I don't. Look at this.

87
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,145
Look... what...
What kind of tools are these?

88
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,512
Okay. All right.

89
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:04,885
- Baby.
- No.

90
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,065
I'll show you, though.
Trust that... I'll show you.

91
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,927
Okay. Well, show me, baby...

92
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,754
Show me by going right on out there

93
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:16,349
to that garage with those tools, tool.

94
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,899
- Curtis...
- You know what, woman?

95
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:24,969
Cur... Curtis, don't do this.

96
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,528
I don't believe you.

97
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:29,739
Rrr!

98
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:49,899
A mess.

99
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,845
And then she gonna go
talk about... talk ab...

100
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,518
She don't even believe I can do it.

101
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:55,550
She's right.

102
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,655
- No, she is not.
- Uncle C.,

103
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,397
you been in this place all this time,

104
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:03,631
and it still looks the same
as it did when you got here.

105
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,226
No, it doesn't.

106
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,003
This place looks so much better.

107
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,402
By whose standards?

108
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,605
By mine.

109
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:15,051
I keep telling you you're
not gonna pass inspection.

110
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,277
Ryan, I know the inspector.

111
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,768
You don't know anyone.
You just moved here.

112
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,518
I wish I didn't know you.

113
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:23,852
That can be arranged.

114
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,094
Boy, please.

115
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,846
Look, uh, get over here and
help me move this thing.

116
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,275
Man, why don't you just hire someone,

117
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
like normal managers?

118
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,434
Oh, my goodness, you sound like Ella.

119
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,392
She's a smart woman.

120
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:38,611
Excuse me?

121
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:41,679
You've been working on this
same dryer for a month,

122
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:43,226
and it still won't get hot.

123
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,474
It's because you won't
do what I tell you to do.

124
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,395
You can't put a space heater
at the bottom of a dryer.

125
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,309
Why not?

126
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,965
Code. Code!

127
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,555
Code schmode.

128
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,039
Okay.

129
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:07,076
You're never gonna get
this place open in time.

130
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:09,921
- You don't know nothing about no code.
- Yes, I do.

131
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,874
Then why didn't you fix
all this stuff then?

132
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:14,585
You know so much...

133
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,543
Why you ain't fix it, Mr. Code?

134
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,444
Look, uncle Robert showed some things

135
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,396
when I was running this
place but not everything.

136
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,733
Some things required skilled labor.

137
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,061
- Have you seen the estimates?
- Yes.

138
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:33,443
All these people were doing
were trying to rip me off.

139
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,674
You got to get these things done.

140
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,580
Not all of 'em...

141
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,536
Especially that one on top right there.

142
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,786
Pfft. Don't need that.

143
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,553
That one? Didn't need that one, neither.

144
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:49,115
Yes, you do. These are life safety.

145
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,232
You see that?
That's a life safety violation.

146
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:56,104
Which means people die. On your watch.

147
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,549
- You think you so smart.
- I am.

148
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,471
Then you need to go to school.

149
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:04,812
I would have if I could afford it.

150
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,248
Instead I'm stuck here with you.

151
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:08,404
That is so dramatic.

152
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:13,151
So get to work and hush, okay?

153
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,213
Can you do that?

154
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,080
Get to work and hush.

155
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,877
Life safety. Please.

156
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,344
This a... life safety...
T-this place is safe.

157
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:23,704
Oh, you really think so?

158
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:30,695
Name one thing that's
not safe in this place.

159
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,721
You.

160
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:34,331
Name another one.

161
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,264
Exhibit "A"... fire alarms.

162
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:38,709
You don't have any.

163
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,686
So what happens if there's a fire?

164
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:43,510
Then I yell "fire!"

165
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,729
[BANGING]

166
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,549
"Fire!" and I run.

167
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:48,979
But not too far.

168
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,606
Jesus, take the wheel.

169
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,008
This place will open,

170
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,422
and it will be a wonderful place.
I can see it now...

171
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,713
"Wash your Payne away laundromat."

172
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,252
You heard me.

173
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,184
You sure you want to go with that name?

174
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:06,934
"Payne" is my name, son.

175
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,560
Oh, and it fits.

176
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,488
You know what? You're a hater.

177
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,251
You a hater, and I'm
gonna figure it out.

178
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,293
And you gonna see...

00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,229
No, no, no, no, no, no, he won't.

353
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,701
- Ah!
- This is my mama's money.

354
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:02,692
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

355
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:04,924
Child, what you talking 'bout?

356
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:07,406
Uncle Robert left her this laundromat.

357
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:10,168
And she sold it to us.

358
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:13,163
- Bu-but that's...
- Listen, baby, the Bible says...

359
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,665
Don't you put that Bible on me.

360
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:18,444
Le boy, Le boy, Le boy.

361
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,498
"The wealth of the wicked

362
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,891
will be laid up for the feet..."

363
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,336
Hey, nuh-uh. Come on.

364
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,576
- No, no, no. That's our money.
- Your mama's money?

365
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,892
Child, your mama don't even
know this money is here.

366
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,618
- Oh, she will after I tell...
- What?

367
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:35,316
What happened to the Christian
woman I was just talking to?

368
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:37,779
She's still here.
She's still here right here,

369
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:39,643
defending her money.

370
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:43,867
Your mama don't even
know this money is here.

371
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:47,477
This money right here belongs to us.

372
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,166
- Go on and call her.
- I will.

373
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,166
Call your mammy.

374
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,994
Miss Ella, do you think that's fair?

375
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,350
Do you think it's fair for your mama

376
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,796
to sell us this piece of rat trap

377
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,318
and make it look like a...?

378
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,770
Baby.

379
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:07,475
So, she embellished a little.

380
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,067
No, your mama lied is what she did.

381
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:10,217
- No.
- You know she lied.

382
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:12,944
It did make $8,000... at one time.

383
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:15,707
Well, this right here

384
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,785
is gonna help us make it again.

385
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,614
So you not gonna give her anything?

386
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,363
Well, you know what? Okay.

387
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:29,110
We'll just count it and
see how much it is, okay?

388
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,542
- Got it.
- And then, wait. Unh-unh.

389
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,745
And then we will...

390
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:34,878
And then we will decide
on what we gonna do after that.

391
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,957
- I think I should keep my...
- No, no. Come on.

392
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:39,544
You just want to get popped, don't you?

393
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,583
No. You just wan... come on.
Put your hand in here.

394
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,931
- No, ma'am.
- Come on, soldier!

395
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,858
With your fatigues. Put it in there!

396
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,760
This isn't right, aunt Ella.

397
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,152
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

398
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:50,674
Don't tell her that we have it.

399
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,203
I'm sorry, aunt Ella,
but I gotta tell my mama.

400
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:55,523
Okay. Fine.

401
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,587
You go on and tell your mama.

402
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:00,255
Go on and tell your mama.
You can tell your daddy.

403
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,509
You can tell your grease,
grease grandmammy.

404
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,293
But ain't none of 'em coming
here to mess with our money.

405
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,800
It's wrong, aunt Ella.

406
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,580
- I thought... oh.
- Hey, it's me.

407
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:15,877
- I thought you...
- It's me.

408
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:17,068
Well, back up.

409
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,440
What you doing back there
anyway looking around?

410
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,283
Miss Ella, you do know money

411
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:24,975
can be the root to a lot of evil.

412
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:28,203
Ah, learn your scriptures, baby.

413
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,408
1 Timothy 6 and 10, the love of money.

414
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,331
And I love this money!

415
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:38,485
Ha!

416
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:41,576
The wonder!

417
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,073
I'm glad I don't have to be
the one to deal with all this.

418
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:48,151
I'm glad you the one that
gonna get all this, too.

419
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,526
Well, it'll be fine. It's gonna be fine.

420
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,618
It's gonna be fine.

421
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:54,711
And wait till your husband finds out.

422
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,658
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not
telling Curtis about this.

423
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,700
- Oh, no.
- Why not?

424
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,616
No, I'm not telling c...

425
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,946
No, I'm not telling Curtis about this.

426
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,936
This will drive Curtis crazy.

427
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,037
Trying to hold on to money is,

428
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:11,705
like Curtis trying to
hold onto a honey bun.

429
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,144
Oh, you know what he really loves?
Pork chops.

430
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,548
No, really. You wanna see it gone?

431
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:21,822
Put one in front of him. That's my baby.

432
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,172
But this money will be gone as fast

433
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,723
as that pork chop will be gone.

434
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:29,198
So, miss Ella, you gonna keep
all this money to yourself?

435
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,728
Yes.

436
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,063
