00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,128
Do you ever feel
like a plastic bag

3
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,997
Drifting throught the wind
wanting to start again

4
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,756
Do you ever feel,
feel so paper thin

5
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:30,633
Like a house of cards,
one blow from caving in

6
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:34,463
Do you ever feel
already buried deep

7
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:36,094
Six feet under scream

8
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:38,605
But no one seems
to hear a thing

9
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:42,259
Do you know that 
there's still a chance for you

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,215
Cause 
there's a spark in you

11
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:49,010
You just gotta 
ignite the light

12
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,898
And let it shine

13
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:56,730
Just own
the night

14
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:00,104
Like the Fourth of July

15
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:04,024
Cause baby 
you're a firework

16
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:07,846
Come on show 'em
what your worth

17
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:11,172
Make 'em go
"Oh, oh, oh!"

18
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:14,971
As you shoot 
across the sky

19
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:19,579
Baby
 you're a firework

20
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:23,318
Come on,
let your colors burst

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,677
Make 'em go
"Oh, oh, oh!"

22
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,892
You're gonna leave 
'em fallin' down

23
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:36,550
You don't have to feel
like a waste of space

24
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:40,532
You're original,
cannot be replaced

25
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:44,308
If you only knew
what the future holds

26
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:48,063
After a hurricane
comes a rainbow

27
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:51,883
Maybe you're reason 
why all the doors are closed

28
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:55,803
So you can open one that leads
you to the perfect road

29
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,754
Like a lightning bolt,
your heart will blow

30
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:01,670
And when it's time,
you'll know

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,405
You just gotta 
ignite the light

32
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:10,222
And let it shine

33
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,215
