7
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:00,450
- (gulping) You scared me!

8
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,150
- Well now you know how we feel.

9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,093
- Mom.

10
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:06,270
- [Becky] Oh, please don't Mom me.

11
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,190
- [John] Stacy.

12
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,490
- Uh Lord, you smell of beer.

13
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,600
- Let me handle this.

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,850
- Why are you taking her side?

15
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,389
- No one is taking anyone's side.

16
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:19,870
- Because you stay out till
all hours getting drunk.

17
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,090
You're gonna end up pregnant.

18
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,923
- [John] Becky!

19
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:24,950
- Like mother, like daughter.

20
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,340
- Now stop it, both of you.

21
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,580
- Don't you let her twist this around.

22
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,660
Johnny go back to bed.

23
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,430
- [Johnny] Fine.

24
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,273
- Fine, she's daddy's
little girl, you handle it.

25
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,000
- Daddy--

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,290
- I don't want to hear it, Stace.

27
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,200
- I just wanna live my own life.

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,220
- Well then just finish school, all right.

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,570
That's all we want, is
for you to graduate,

30
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,040
maybe go to college, even.

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,750
You know, make something of yourself

32
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,150
so that you don't wind up waiting tables

33
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,760
and painting houses like me

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,160
and driving a cab nights
just to make ends meet.

35
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,930
Stace, there are times in your
life when you make a decision

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,360
and that decision it affects
the rest of your life

37
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,660
and if you make the wrong one--

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,010
- Me living on my own,
it just makes sense.

39
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,140
- Well it doesn't to us.

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,520

more than $200 between 'em.

No, I think they'll be
home inside of a week

cut off my college money.

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440

you'll get in the car.

115

We're down to, we're
down to $60 between us.

118
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,430
- And where are we gonna live
till we get our first check?

119

What are we gonna eat?

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,470

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,303
We can take buses.

122
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:49,280

123

This isn't one of your romantic fantasies.

124
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,660

Hey, what's he doing, bothering you?

Sometimes he's kind of clumsy.

208
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,140
Eddie go check the truck.

209
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,170
He don't mean no harm.

210
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,679
Just sees beauty and can't resist.

214
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,877
- And you are?

215
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,980
- Stacey Sapp.

216
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,370
- Well, maybe you'd let me make
up for Eddie's bad manners.

217
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,470
Uh, unless you're waiting on someone.

218
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,430
- Just Lou, just a guy who gave me a ride.

219
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,320
- Oh I see and then where you off to?

220
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,843
- Home, I guess.

221
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,330
- Well, Stacey if you
don't mind me saying,

222
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,080
you don't sound too happy about it.

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,870
But I know just how you feel.

224
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,070
I ran away myself when
I was about your age.

225
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,010
What am I doing?

226
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,750
I'm about to talk your ear
off with ancient history

227
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,050
and you'd probably rather
be watching a movie.

228
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,640
- Oh no, I saw it already.

230
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,130
- Yeah so I told those Freeborn boys,

231
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,790
hey you don't want this load of birds

232
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,600
I know someone who does.

233
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,730
- And did you?

234
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,190
- Well not right at that moment. (laughs)

235
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,070
See, there's not too much
market for dehydrated chickens

236
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,040
but sometimes trucking's
like poker and life.

237
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,710
You gotta know how to bluff.

238
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,240
- So what happened?

239
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,010
- Well I laid off the entire load

240
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,089
up in Bismarck North Dakota.

241
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,918
Of course I had to take
a loss on dead birds but.

243
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,650
You know, that's the price

244
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,399

00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:44,810

will take you back to, uh?

to do with your life.

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,430

274
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,860

all the lot lizards,

289
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
what do you want with some jailbait hick?

290
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,170

295
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,610
- [Richard] Stacy!

296
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,480
- I just thought, I mean,

297
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,370
you know I'm probably gonna go home

298
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,290
but right now I'm not sure.

299
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,330
So I was thinking that
maybe I could ride with you

300
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,843
until I made up my mind.

301
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:03,900
- Course.

302
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,733
- Great.

303
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,060
I left my stuff with Lou.

304
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,000
- Oh don't worry about it.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,833
- [Stacy] But my clothes.

306
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,800

- Okay.

309
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,070
- A loan, I didn't bring
that much stuff anyway.

310

- Sure, come on, climb aboard.

312

Get comfy, all right.

314

354

- Stacy don't do this.

356
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,593
- Do what Mom?

357
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:08,600

360
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,190

362
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,943
- Bye Mom.

00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,668
(dial tone beeping)

365
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,950
- Everything okay?

366
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,783
- Yeah.

367
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:31,775
(phone dings)

368
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,087
(Becky sighs)

369
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:34,920
- Oh.

370
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,983
(Becky sighs)

371
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:41,844
(truck rumbling)

372
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:44,778
(somber music)

373
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:48,060
(upbeat music)

374
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,893
- [Richard] How's he doing?

375
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,260
- He's doing well, he's asleep

376
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,150
but I still think he needs a tetanus shot

377
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,720
since he cut it on the truck door.

378
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,170
- Hey Florence Nightingale, (laughs)

379
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,050
some sack time he'll be good as new.

380
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,620
- Just know what it feels
like to be sick and alone.

381
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,610
- You?

382
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,060
I'll bet you've never been
alone a day in your life.

383
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,440
Well, just because you live with people

384
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,630
doesn't mean you're not alone.

385
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,740
And sometimes, no, a lot of times,

386
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,438
it feels like I was born into
the wrong family or something.

387
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:16,470
♪ So now give me ♪

388
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,530
- Which is weird when you think about it

389
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,780
'cause I get along great with Gram.

390
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,684
Yeah, she's got this farm with horses

391
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:25,350
and this house, like
from Gone With The Wind.

392
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,920
And when I go there and
visit in the summer,

393
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,970
I felt like that's where I really belong.

394
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,680
Except, my mom got jealous.

395
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,600
- [Richard] Yeah, how come?

396
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,250
- We're just different,

397
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,400
not like me and my dad.

398
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,360
No, he respects me.

399
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:43,505
We can talk and he trusts me.

400
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,484
- Yeah and I can see why.

401
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:55,785
You're good company, Stace.

402
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,163
Hey look at that sky.

403
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,615

00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:10,642

00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:14,486

- Well,

412
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,230
I don't see the point of this.

413
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,660
I think she's made her decision

414
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,270
and she's not coming home.

415
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,300
- Becky, we don't know that.

416
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,030
You know, she could be in trouble.

417
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,060
- Well.

418
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,670
- Just record the call, all right

419
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,210
and she might leave some hint

420
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,325
or clue about where she is.

421
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,180
- All right.

422
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,439
- All right?

423
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,939
- Yeah, all right.

424
00:22:56,406 --> 00:23:01,406
Bye.
- Bye.

425
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:21,618
- [Stacy] What's he doing back there?

426
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:22,968
- Why don't you go ask him.

427
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:29,701
(horn beeping)

428
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,430
(door creaking)

429
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,890
- Hey shut the damn door.

430
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,103
Stacy!

431
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,233
Stace, Stace.

432
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,458
I didn't know it was
you, come on, come here.

433
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,909
Come on.

434
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,320
(Richard grunts)

435
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,210
I'm sorry about yelling.

436
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,043
- [Stacy] It's okay.

437
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,330
- Can I trust you?

438
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,860
- Yeah sure I guess.

439
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,270
- Now don't guess.

440
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,680
We're gonna be road dogs,
I mean traveling buddies,

441
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,513
I got to know.

442
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,059
- Yeah.

443
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:10,892
- Okay.

444
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:11,830
You remember Freeborn?

445
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,450
That company that lost me all that money.

446
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,980
Well they're paying for this trip.

447
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,180
- You mean, you like?

448
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,970
- Well I call it justice,
retribution, restitution.

449
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,960
Listen here, if it troubles
you, I'll understand.

450
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,890
I'll put you on a ride back to Illinois

451
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,790
first chance we get, no hard feelings.

452
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,340
- What's in there?

453
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,619
- Oh that.

454
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:40,619
I'll show you later.

455
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,720
- [Stacy] Promise?

456
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
- I promise.

457
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,953
Come on.

458
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,750
(gentle music)

459
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,320
- Freeborn Trucking, never heard of it.

460
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,936
- Me neither, til I
started driving for 'em.

461
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:56,186
- [Cashier] Hm.

462
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,934
- [Man On TV] So did you get the job?

463
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:09,767
- [Man On TV] Get the job?

464
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:10,965
Hey, I didn't even get the interview.

465
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:13,800
(people on television laughing)

466
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,300
- Seems so strange doesn't it?

467
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,880
Stacy could be watching that same program,

468
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,840
laughing at the same jokes.

469
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,270
- Yeah well you're assuming

470
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,440
she's even in the same time zone. (scoffs)

471
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:30,398
- You know what I mean.

472
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,543
- Yeah I do.

473
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:40,150
(Becky sighs)

474
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,750
You know sometimes I wonder
if I was too hard on her

475
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,715
because I was worried, you know,

476
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:49,350
and I loved her so much

477
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,840
and I wanted so much for her.

478
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,140
- I know you did.

479
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,390
She was my little girl,
John, we were friends.

480
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
Then one day I just woke
up and I was the enemy.

481
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,810
Anyway you were right,

482
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,620
I did always have to have the last word

483
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,400
but right about now I'd
sure like to hear her voice.

484
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:29,557
(traffic humming)

485
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,270
- Well, how do these look?

486
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,343
- Hm-mm.

487
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:41,390
- Like a whore who thinks she's a virgin.

488
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:43,925
Hey!

489
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,510
- What kind of thing is that to say?

490
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,480
- [Eddie] Man it was just a joke.

491
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,090
- Man apologize, apologize.

492
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,256
- It's okay, it's all right.

493
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:54,270
(door knocks)

494
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,103
- [Richard] Who is it?

495
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:58,850
- [Delivery Man] Pizza.

496
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,070
That'll be 16.95.

497
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,820
- Here keep the change.

498
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:16,593
There'll be none for you.

499
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,190
Not till you tell her you're sorry.

500
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,520
- Richard, it's okay.

501
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,752
- No it's not.

502
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:21,585
- Come on, man.

503
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,480
Come on.

504
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,790
- [Richard] Want to get the Vegas?

505
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,300
- You buy all this crap for her,

506
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,500
I can't even have a
stinking slice of pizza?

507
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,020
- [Richard] You want pizza?

508
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,283
You want pizza?

509
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,116
(Richard grunts)

510
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:37,949
- Richard stop!

511
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,870
- You're drunk.

512
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,100
Get out.

513
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,510
You want money?

514
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,550
Here get yourself a room

515
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,400
'cause you sure as hell
ain't sleeping here.

516
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,920
(Eddie crying)

517
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,330
You deaf?

518
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,163
Move!

519
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:55,394
(Eddie grunting)

520
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,350
- I'll go, I'll go.

521
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,510
- No, I'll go.

522
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:02,730
(Eddie crying)

523
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,255
- Its okay, it's okay.

524
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,583
- I'm sorry.

525
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,360
I ain't got no rich grandma.

526
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,830
I got no home to go back
to, no money, no folks.

527
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,270
I gotta get to Vegas.

528
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,280
I didn't mean it.
- I know.

529
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,380
- What I said.
- I know, its okay.

530
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,340
- But it's just that
there's already trouble

531
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,040
and you know, you mean the checks?

532
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,153
- You know?

533
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:36,020
- Yeah, he told me.

534
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,830
- You want to go to jail?

535
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,050
- I didn't steal anything.

536
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,630
- But you know and he knows you know

537
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,940
and you don't trust nobody,

538
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,773
nobody.
- He trusts me.

539
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:48,680
He does.
- You don't know,

540
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,010
you don't know what he's like.

541
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,843
- Sure I do.

542
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:52,703
- You don't.
- I do.

543
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,733
- [Richard] Get out.

544
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,295
- Its okay, I'll come get you
in the morning, I promise.

545
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:04,128
I promise.

546
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,000
Here.

547
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,813
- I'm sorry

548
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:10,646
- It's too late.

549
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,980
Sorry about throwing stuff.

550
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,140
- Think when the boy
can't hold his liquor,

551
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,880
talking you that way, that bothers me.

552
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,620
- People drink to block out the pain.

553
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,920
- Oh where'd you hear that on Oprah?

554
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
- Hey what did I do?

555
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,433
- Nothing.

556
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,722
Come on.

557
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:47,480
(somber music)

558
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,313
Let's eat.

559
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,000
It's getting cold, come on.

560
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,370
Just people start talking about pain

561
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,790
to me pain's kids crying for their Mamas

562
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,630
except their Mamas never come.

563
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,810
Guys in lockup screaming, somebody help me

564
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,590
and actually just laugh.

565
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,300
- You were in jail?

566
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,660
- No big thing.

567
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,493
Gambling.

568
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,470
I spent six months on a county
farm, chopping cotton days,

569
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,120
nights listening to guys
whimpering in their sleep.

570
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:42,808
- I'm sorry.

571
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,610
- Then I saw you.

572
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,060
I knew, said there is a
woman who understands,

573
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,290
not a girl, a woman.

574
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,630
- I'm not that special Richard.

575
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,010
- Look at you, you just starting out.

576
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,610
- That doesn't mean I
don't know what I want.

577
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,753
- Huh.

578
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:17,438
And What's that?

579
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:21,217
(gentle music)

580
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:26,560
Oh, well I ain't the lucky one.

581
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,290
- [Stacy] It's not like
I'm a virgin or anything.

582
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,600
- [Richard] I'm gonna
treat you like you one.

583
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,700
You're old enough to understand
what you're offering,

584
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,650
I'd love to accept.

585
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,690
Stacy!

586
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,040
It's too important to rush.

587
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,319
But don't get me wrong,

588
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,890
it's not like I don't
have feelings and desires,

589
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,450
it's just I don't want you thinking

590
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,520
what I feel for you is just
about sex, ya understand?

591
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,680
I'm not willing to risk my life

592
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,620
counting on some woman who's not sure.

593
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:05,534
You see?

594
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,080
I did once.

595
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
- I am sure.

596
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,403
- Maybe.

597
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,230
I sure hope so, for my sake.

598
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,950
(upbeat music)

599
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:44,744
(phone ringing)

600
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,533
- Ready?

601
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,450
Hello?

602
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,460
- [Stacy] Daddy?

603
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,930
- Stacy, it's good to
hear from you, honey.

604
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,390
We've been worried.

605
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,340
- [Stacy] I'm fine.

606
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,980
- Where are you?

607
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,790
- I'm fine daddy really, like I told Mom,

608
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm with some friends.

609
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,760
- Uh-huh, who?

610
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,950
- [Stacy] Promise you won't get mad?

611
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,710
- We're not mad, honey,
we're just worried.

612
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,860
- I was talking to Dad.

613
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,320
- We just want to know you're okay.

614
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,910
- I'm fine, I'm wonderful.

615
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,620
- [Man] I am, I am.

616
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,640
- I met a man.

617
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,560
- A man?

618
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,050
- It's not what you think, Daddy.

619
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,090
- Now Stace, you--

620
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,100
- He loves me and he's a nice guy too.

621
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,460
He's the one who wanted me to call you

622
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,270
so that you know I was okay.

623
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,910
- Well you tell him that
we appreciate that honey.

624
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,540
What's his name?

625
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,373
- Richard.

626
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:39,810
- [John] Well why don't you put him on,

627
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,880
maybe Richard and I can have
a little talk, man to man.

628
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,170
- Daddy I have to go.

629
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,510
- No, no honey, um.

630
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,420
- Look Stacy, just call us again, okay,

631
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,220
so that we can sleep nights, all right?

632
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,053
- I will.

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,710
- Nothing darling.

662
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,050
You remember I promised

663
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,450
when the time was right.

664
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,583
Show her.

665
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,529
(Stacy gasps)

666
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,310
There ain't nothing to be afraid of.

667
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,460
That's just protection.

668
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,220
- Against what, who?

669
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,950
- Eddie can we have some privacy.

670
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,120
Maybe I should have told you before.

671
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,380
All right, sit down down.

672
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,540
But there didn't seem any point,

673
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,930
not if you weren't gonna stay.

674
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,820
Now that you are, well, I
guess you know how I feel.

675
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,260
If anything ever happened to you,

676
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,380
I don't know what I'd do.

677
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,350
Now I'm not saying
something's gonna happen

678
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,420
but you never can tell.

679
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:45,853
There's lots of weirdos out there.

680
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,330
It's okay for now.

681
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,260
But if you come to feel
the same way about me

682
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,943
as I do about you, mm,

683
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,022
then I might need your
help someday, Stace.

684
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:10,794
(gentle music)

685
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,330
Mm.

686
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,010
I'd like to know I could count on you.

687
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,612
I just might need your help someday.

688
00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:26,195
(gentle music)

689
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:43,083
(birds chirping)

690
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:50,578
(Stacy and Richard laughing)

691
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,960
You know I wanted us to be by ourselves

692
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,330
'cause I want to explain
something about myself,

693
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,580
before we go any further.

694
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,270
See Stace, I was married once before.

695
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,320
Yeah I got two girls.

696
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,721
Of course I haven't seen them in years,

697
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:13,470
ever since their Mama
went off with another guy.

698
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,430
And I haven't had much to
do with women since then.

699
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:20,210
Not till I met you.

700
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,610
I just thought you should know.

701
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,780
Seeings how, Stace.

702
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:34,262
(Stacy gasps)

703
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,460
- I'd feel a lot better about this

704
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,500
if I didn't know where the
money for it came from.

705
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,710
- Stace, as soon as we get to Vegas

706
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,230
I swear I'll burn the checks.

707
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,173
But right now for you
I'd do anything anything.

708
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:50,608
- Anything?

709
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:52,535
- You and me.

710
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:53,605
- Oh, oh!

711
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:56,714
(John and Stacy laughing)

712
00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:59,297
(somber music)

713
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,270
Anything?

714
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,340
- Come on, Stace, we settled the guns.

715
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,890
- Please, Richard, they scare me.

716
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,990
- Know what scares me?

717
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,050
Not being able to defend a woman

718
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,020
I hope will be the mother of my children.

719
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,950
Now I lost one wife.

720
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,218
- You are not gonna lose me.

721
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:30,980
- Oh you better believe it.

722
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,320
Now Stace, don't take it,
not if you're not serious,

723
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,670
not if you don't mean to stay.

724
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,173
(gentle music)

725
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:58,782
Forever?

726
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:01,303
- Forever.

727
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:02,520
- Yeah girl!

728
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,270
(Richard and Stacy laughing)

729
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:09,168
(Stacy screams)

730
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,246
Oh, oh!

731
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:12,996
(Stacy laughing)

732
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:16,130
- [Stacy] It's not what you think Daddy.

733
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,970
- [John] Now Stace, you--

734
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,210
- [Stacy] He loves me
and he's a nice guy too.

735
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,530
He's the one who wanted me to call you

736
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,930
so that you know I was okay.

737
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:25,110
- [Becky] You tell him that we appreciate.

738
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,283
- Wait a minute.

739
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:28,460
- Look folks, I, uh,

740
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,420
I realize how upset you are,
I got two kids of my own

741
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,670
but the reality is that she's 18.

742
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,660
Legally she's not even a runaway

743
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,661
and it's obvious she's with
this guy voluntarily so--

744
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:40,828
(tape recorder bangs)

745
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,410
- John, wait a second.

746
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,243
- What do you care?

747
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:49,000
You don't even want her
back in the first place.

748
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,930
- That is a damn lie.

749
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,250
- She disturbs your precious peace.

750
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,810
- Oh don't you use that against me,

751
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,643
don't you dare.

752
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:56,180
I told you how I felt

753
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,770
and just because I'm not
screaming and yelling

754
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,980
that doesn't mean that I don't care.

755
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,650
There. (sighs)

756
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:08,710
(traffic hums)

757
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,580
- [Stacy] No, Richard, no.

758
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,140
- You're gonna be my wife.

759
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,040
You got to get past this fear.

760
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
You got to be ready.

761
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,290
Now come on honey, take it.

762
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,620
- Hey Rich, maybe we should just

763
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,490
chill out on the gun thing, you know?

764
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,330
- Get out.

765
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,970
This here's family business.

766
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,640
Come on, get out, Keep Watch.

767
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,570
- For what?

768
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,403
- Just get out.

769
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:41,520
Now honey, a gun is just a tool.

770
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,560
- To kill people.

771
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,360
- Only if they're trying to hurt you

772
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,490
or someone you love and
only if it's loaded.

773
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,680
Now Stace, Stace.

774
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,200
Would you take the damn gun.

775
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,940
- You, you, you're hurting me.

776
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,495
- Don't make me hurt you more.

777
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:02,272
Now take the gun.

778
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,566
Take it.

779
00:42:03,566 --> 00:42:05,554
(gunshot rings)
(Stacy screams)

780
00:42:05,554 --> 00:42:07,050
- (screams) Ow, my eye.

781
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,170
- Damn!
- What happened?

782
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,560
- Stupid son of a bitch.

783
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,000
Who told you to load it?

784
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,833
- You did.

785
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,135
- Shut up, just check outside.

786
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:15,616
(Stacy screaming)

787
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,720
Come on, let me see.

788
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,553
Let me see.

789
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,110
- All clear.

790
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,410
- [Richard] Get the stuff.

791
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,640
Come on, let's go.

792
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,820
- Now what'd you say happen?

793
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,870
- Wood shavings got
thrown from a table saw.

794
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,480
- Hmm, yeah it looks like gunpowder to me.

795
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,379
- [Richard] There was
some graphite mixed in.

796
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:39,810
- Hm-mm.

797
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,300
- Well, you leave that
patch on for a day or two

798
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,250
and put this ointment on

799
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,660
and I'll get you some
pills for the pain, okay?

800
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,850
- Oh god.

801
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,000
- Keep your mouth shut.

802
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,570
- Hey, you're the one
who got us into this.

803
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,700
- That's right and I'm the
one who's gonna get us out.

804
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,310
- Richard this is a hospital.

805
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,180
- Where you're not
staying, forever remember?

806
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:10,277
- [Receptionist] Dr. Lynn,
please call line one.

807
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,913
- You all right?

808
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,630
Well if you need anything,

809
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,850
anything at all, you
come on back, you hear?

810
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,530
- Thanks Doc, you've been great.

811
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,263
Hasn't he hun?

812
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,225
Come on.

813
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:38,956
- [Receptionist] Dr. Kim to room 222.

814
00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:42,110
(phone ringing)

815
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,736
- Didn't I warn ya?

816
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:47,410
You thought you're so damn
smart, so sophisticated, wannabe.

817
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,210
- I know, I was wrong.

818
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,130
Eddie all we have to do
now is walk out of here.

819
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:54,963
- We?

820
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:55,796
- Eddie!

821
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:58,120
- No and don't start crying,
okay, he'd said you'd cry.

822
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,390
- Okay, okay let me just use
the phone please, please.

823
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:06,863
- Go ahead.

824
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,060
He said you'd try that too.

825
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,240
- All I want to do is get out of here.

826
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,660
I want to go to Vegas
but not with Richard.

827
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,493
With you.

828
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,333
Please.

829
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,500
Come on.

830
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,730
We can go, please--

831
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,210
- Do you think he just
went through the drugstore

832
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,630
to get some aspirin?

833
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,570
What if this is a test?

834
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,403
Huh?

835
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:39,540
What if he's right outside that door,

836
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,690
he could kill us both.

837
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,530
- Maybe you're not so dumb after all.

838
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,213
You okay?

839
00:44:58,478 --> 00:44:59,870
(Stacy crying)

840
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:03,350
I keep telling ya, there
ain't nothing to worry about.

841
00:45:04,443 --> 00:45:06,400
As soon as we get to
Vegas we'll get married

842
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,800
and everything will be okay.

843
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,103
Okay?

844
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,383
Stace?

845
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,633
Okay?

846
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,380
- Maybe before we get married,
maybe I should go home.

847
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:26,863
- Home?

848
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,810
You are home with me.

849
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:36,230
(Stacy crying)

850
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,063
Aren't you?

851
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:38,843
Aren't you?

852
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,600
I love you, I do, but you're scaring me.

853
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,820
- Come on now, don't cry.

854
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,210
I can't stand to see you cry.

855
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,740
What'll make you feel better?

856
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,530
Hm?

857
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,090
- Can I please call my folks?

858
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,125
Please.

859
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,708
(gentle music)

860
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:08,289
(Stacy sniffling)

861
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:29,842
(phone ringing)

862
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,360
- [Becky] You've reached the Sapps.

863
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,930
John, Becky, Stacy, and Johnny.

864
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,342
Please leave a message.

865
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:38,420
(answering machine beeps)

866
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,920
- Hi, Mom, Dad, um Johnny,

867
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,990
I just want to tell you guys that I'm,

868
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,140
that I'm okay and then I'm getting married

869
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,560
but not here in Oklahoma

870
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,100
but in Las Vegas.

871
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,500
- Get me that, damn it!
(Stacy screams)

872
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,510
Damn you're just like all the rest of 'em.

873
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:03,340
No talent, lying, conniving, bitches.

874
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,690
- Richard, Richard, I'm sorry please.

875
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,490
It just snuck out, please.

876
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:11,490
(Stacy crying)

877
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,690
- Go downstairs.

878
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,740
Move everything from the
truck to the caddy part side,

879
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,220
remember forever.

880
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,520
Y'all screw up, something happens,

881
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
a whole lotta people beside
us could end up dying.

882
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,120
I wouldn't want that on my conscience.

883
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,953
Go ahead.

884
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:32,030
I ain't gonna hurt you.

885
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,330
Don't you know I love you?

886
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,260
Don't you know I'd do anything for you?

887
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,790
- Please Richard, please.

888
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:42,490
- I told you.

889
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:44,590
- Ow!
- Don't put it on

890
00:47:45,777 --> 00:47:47,077
if you don't mean to stay.

891
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,270
Didn't I tell you that?

892
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:53,340
- I love you, Richard,
but you are scaring me,

893
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,310
don't you understand, I am scared.

894
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:59,315
(Stacy crying)

895
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:04,870
- Oh, well I've been
thinking, I've been thinking,

896
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,120
the only, the only reason
we can get in trouble

897
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,170
is the checks, right?

898
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,190
- What if I was to tell
you I figured a way

899
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,290
not to write any more.

900
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,655
Hey, get some money so we
can throw those checks away.

901
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:20,580
Would you like that?

902
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,850
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

903
00:48:22,808 --> 00:48:25,601
Okay here's what we're gonna do.

904
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:28,601
(suspenseful music)

905
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:35,160
(truck whooshing)

906
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,200
Get it done?

907
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,830
- Switched the plates
and locked the truck.

908
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,460
- Good boy, start the car.

909
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,313
- Come on man, why don't
we just let her go?

910
00:48:42,313 --> 00:48:43,363
I mean this is crazy.

911
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,750
- Come on.

912
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,810
- I don't think I should do this.

913
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,130
- Hey you're gonna be my wife, remember?

914
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,470
- I know but please, my folks--

915
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,580
- Don't worry, don't worry.

916
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,680
I'll help you convince 'em.

917
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,843
- Richard--

918
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:58,490
- Hey, who's more important?

919
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,323
Me or them?

920
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:07,840
Okay.

921
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,026
(phone ringing)

922
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,663
- Hello?

923
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:31,780
- [Richard] Hey John, how's the Sapps?

924
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,180
- Who is this?

925
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,310
- Daddy?

926
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,350
- [John] Stacy?

927
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,020
- Daddy, I want to come home.

928
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,720
- [John] Where are you honey?

929
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,120
- I can't tell you.

930
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,060
- Are you in Oklahoma?

931
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,600
- All I can tell you is

932
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,530
he wants $30,000.

933
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,865
Ow!

934
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:48,698
(Stacy screaming)

935
00:49:48,698 --> 00:49:49,800
- You listen here.

936
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm done with her.

937
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,980
You want her, you got her for 30 grand.

938
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,770
You got two days now and remember no cops

939
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,781
or I'll send her back a piece at a time.

940
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:02,891
(dial tone beeping)

941
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:04,700
(John whimpering)

942
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,031
(Richard laughing)

943
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:10,260
Yeah that was pretty convincing, huh?

944
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:14,047
Good job, baby.

945
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,633
(Becky crying)

946
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:22,577
(traffic whooshing)

947
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:25,300
- I'm telling you, this is a
shakedown not a kidnapping.

948
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,700
- And that attitude's why
I'm glad the FBI is here now.

949
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,400
- Look Sapp, we're the
ones who called the FBI.

950
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,200
- We're not ruling out anything.

951
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,033
- Thank you.

952
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:37,764
(Richard snoring)

953
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:40,431
(door creaking)

954
00:50:44,862 --> 00:50:47,862
(suspenseful music)

955
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:01,577
- Stacy, Stacy, come on.

956
00:51:01,577 --> 00:51:06,123
Shh, come on.

957
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:10,282
Hurry up, come on.

958
00:51:10,282 --> 00:51:12,086
- Going somewhere?

959
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:13,927
- Run!
(Stacy screams)

960
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:17,677
(Richard and Eddie grunting)

961
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,280
- [Stacy] Eddie, the gun, here.

962
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,620
- Don't move, freeze!

963
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:29,000
- You think I'm gonna let
you take her away from me?

964
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,060
- No man, I don't want to,

965
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,140
it's just that this ransom thing,

966
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,540
it's gonna bring the cops
down on us, you know?

967
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,970
- Us?

968
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,940
There ain't no us.

969
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,013
Not anymore.

970
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,473
It's her and me.

971
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:54,163
Well, come on man, do it.

972
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,028
Do it big man.

973
00:51:57,028 --> 00:52:00,028
(suspenseful music)

974
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:06,803
Ain't so easy killing a
man face to face, is it?

975
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,670
Give me that.

976
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,230
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

977
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,700
- Oh god, Richard, please don't hurt him.

978

(Stacy screams)

979
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:18,680

I understand that

1009
00:53:59,576 --> 00:54:01,680
but just hanging around makes you tense.

1010
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,150

1011
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,863

1018
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,630

1019
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,650

30,000, we don't--

1021
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:32,830
- Maybe you could ask that

1022
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,470
rich mom of yours down in Florida.

1023
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:37,220
Maybe she could sell
one of her thoroughbred.

1024
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,290
- [Becky] Please don't--

1025
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,550
- Just get it.

1026
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,710
I'll call tomorrow night

1027

(phone beeps)

1029
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,450

(somber music)

1031
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:06,270

Stacy!
(tires squealing)

1037
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:37,537
- [Stacy] Dad!

1038
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:42,537
(horn beeping)
(tires squealing)

1039
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:43,826
- Stacy!

1040
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:52,682
Oh god.

1041
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:12,364
- You're here?

1042
00:56:12,364 --> 00:56:13,490
- It's just that they caught some guy

1043
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,440
who claims he was with Brown and the girl.

1044
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,800
- Yeah this guy, Eddie Lowell,
street kid from Newark.

1045
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,170
He was with brown when he picked her up.

1046
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,110
- What do we got on Brown?

1047
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,780
- Uh, he spent his
childhood in a foster home,

1048
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,440
since then in and out of
mental hospitals and jail,

1049
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,273
drugs and assault.

1050
00:56:25,273 --> 00:56:28,840
The man is unpredictable,
we assume he's dangerous.

1051
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,910
- Do we tell them that?

1052
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,520
- No, not unless it's
absolutely necessary.

1053
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,920
Family's under enough strain as it is,

1054
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,109
well, with John losing his
job and everything, all right?

1055
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:41,109
- Right, okay.
- Let's go.

1056
00:56:44,038 --> 00:56:45,638
- Please, please just let me go.

1057
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:48,080
I won't tell anyone, I promise

1058
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,590
you can just disappear.

1059
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,200
- I plan to, out of Miami,
down to the islands.

1060
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,288
There's still time.

1061
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,538
You can still change
your mind, come with me.

1062
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:02,790
If you love me, if you ever loved me--

1063
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,623
- I loved you.

1064
00:57:03,623 --> 00:57:07,560
If I loved you, you're
the one wanting to leave,

1065
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,393
desert me.

1066
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,660
- How can I marry you?

1067
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,510
When they catch you they're
gonna throw you in jail or...

1068
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:16,178
- Or what?

1069
00:57:18,827 --> 00:57:20,127
- I don't want you to die.

1070
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,940
I don't want anybody to die.

1071
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:27,967
(somber music)

1072
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,180
- Well you see then,

1073
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,790
it could have been Stacey
that John saw yesterday.

1074
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:38,603
- It's possible.

1075
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,940
- Well what do we know
about this Richard Brown.

1076
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,370
- We're still checking on that.

1077
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,880
We know he's a trucker.

1078
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,450
The Oklahoma State Police found his rig

1079
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,040
parked at a truck stop just where

1080
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,340
Eddie Lowell said it would be

1081
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,990
when they picked him up in Texas.

1082
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,300
- Would he really hurt her?

1083
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,900
- Look, uh, we always have
to be prepared for the worst

1084
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,690
but the good good news is

1085
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,160
from what we know now Stacey
really wants to come home.

1086
00:58:06,771 --> 00:58:09,438
(phone ringing)

1087
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,140
- Hello?

1088
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,990
- Don't talk.

1089
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,660
You so much as breathe
wrong, she gets hurt.

1090
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,650
You double-cross me and she dies.

1091
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,420
You got that?

1092
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,253
- Yes.

1093
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,020
- [Richard] You got the money?

1094
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,450
- Not yet, the banks won't loan it to us

1095
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,770
and my mother-in-law
has to sell something.

1096
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,130
- Yeah, well you got less than 24 hours,

1097
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,230
after that she's dead.

1098
00:58:41,404 --> 00:58:42,904
- What do you expect us to do?

1099
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:47,510
- (sighs) You deliver the money, alone,

1100
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,880
to the Golden Waffle in
Great Plains, Kansas,

1101
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,780
8:00 a.m. tomorrow

1102
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,880
and remember Daddy, I
know what you look like.

1103
00:59:00,038 --> 00:59:03,121
(suspenseful music)

1104
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,530
- When do we leave?

1105
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:10,580
- We don't, Mr. Sapp.

1106
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,780
Now I understand how concerned

1107
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,130
you and your wife are

1108
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,150
but we can't put anyone else at risk here.

1109
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,310
- But you heard him.

1110
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,370
He knows what I look like.

1111
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,050
If you try to use one of
your agents, he'll know.

1112
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,730
- If you can't keep your
head and follow orders

1113
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,529
that's a risk we'll have to take.

1114
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:27,529
(suspenseful music)

1115
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:34,916
(kitten meowing)

1116
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:40,285
- Aw.

1117
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,793
(gun clicking)

1118
00:59:45,793 --> 00:59:48,293
(cat meowing)

1119
00:59:52,073 --> 00:59:52,906
- [Agent] The most important bit

1120
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:54,480
is going along with the plan.

1121
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,680
- But what happens to Stacy

1122
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,470
if he finds out you don't have the money?

1123
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,303
- Won't get that far, son.

1124
00:59:59,303 --> 01:00:01,810
As soon as the FBI sees
him, they can grab him.

1125
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,020
- Yeah they won't do anything
to put her in danger.

1126
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,597
- Yeah right.

1127
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:08,550
- Look Johnny, I'm not
gonna lie to you, okay.

1128
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,600
Things could go wrong

1129
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,440
but Mr. Harris and his agents
are doing everything they can

1130
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,020
to make sure they don't

1131
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,290
and what I need from you is for you

1132
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,640
to stay here with your
mom and be strong, okay?

1133
01:00:21,713 --> 01:00:24,296
(somber music)

1134
01:00:30,357 --> 01:00:32,857
(Becky sighs)

1135
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,730
- Told you, put the damn cat outside.

1136
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:44,540
- Please let me keep
him, he'll make me happy.

1137
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,090
- Like I don't, right?

1138
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,210
Come here, come over here.

1139
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:04,796
(cat meowing)

1140
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:05,690
Not gonna hurt you.

1141
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,820
You know, all I ever
want, all I ever wanted

1142
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,860
is to make you happy

1143
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,670
and you could be still.

1144
01:01:22,907 --> 01:01:24,149
Stace.

1145
01:01:24,149 --> 01:01:26,250
(cat meowing)

1146
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,100
Come with me, please.

1147
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:32,423
I love you.

1148
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:35,596
Please.

1149
01:01:35,596 --> 01:01:38,179
(gentle music)

1150
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:49,711
(birds chirping)

1151
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,160
- Hey Johnny, wake up.

1152
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,700
- Becky, there's nothing you can do there.

1153
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,120
- If you were me, where would you be?

1154
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,150
At home, waiting for the phone to ring

1155
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,370
or with your husband and your daughter?

1156
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,240
- At least leave the boy.

1157
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,073
- No.

1158
01:02:26,073 --> 01:02:27,770
- No, can't do that.

1159
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:29,240
He already feels responsible

1160
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,610
and well if anything were to happen

1161
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,950
he should be with his family.

1162
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,240
Look I know you're just
trying to do your job, okay,

1163
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,179
but feeling for people
isn't that part of it?

1164
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:46,762
(gentle music)

1165
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:05,073
- Let's go to Kansas, step on it, will ya?

1166
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,189
(diners chatting)
- Here you go.

1167
01:03:14,189 --> 01:03:16,856
(ominous music)

1168
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:37,720
- Ever read Romeo and Juliet?

1169
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,870
Forever, even in death

1170
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:44,380
but don't worry nothing's gonna happen

1171
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:49,380
but if it does, I promise
I'll kill you first.

1172
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,990
(cat meowing)

1173
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,823
Come here.

1174
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,876
Come here.

1175
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:03,376
(cat meowing)

1176
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:28,298
Is that him?

1177
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,582
- That's him.

1178
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:35,582
(suspenseful music)

1179
01:04:36,768 --> 01:04:38,610
(phone ringing)

1180
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,420
- Careful, could be watching you.

1181
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,253
- Golden Waffle.

1182
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,203
Who?

1183
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:48,630
If your name is John Sapp,

1184
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:51,954
there's a guy on the phone
who wants to talk to you.

1185
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,077
- All right.

1186
01:04:53,077 --> 01:04:56,160
(suspenseful music)

1187
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,490
- There you go.

1188
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,363
- Yes?

1189
01:05:10,363 --> 01:05:11,196
- [Richard] Sapp.

1190
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,260
- Now what?

1191
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,370
Now she dies, I told you no cops.

1192
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,460
- What cops?

1193
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,420
There are no cops.

1194
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,500
- Yeah there better not be.

1195
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,770
- Look please for God's sakes,

1196
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,960
can we just get this over with?

1197
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,170
- Patience Daddy, patience.

1198
01:05:41,757 --> 01:05:42,590
- I see him.

1199
01:05:43,636 --> 01:05:46,719
(suspenseful music)

1200
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,380
- Can you get a shot?

1201
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,530
- Negative, he's using
the girl as a shield

1202
01:05:56,068 --> 01:05:57,700
and he's using binocs.

1203
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,373
- Miss.

1204
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,680
- Look Jed, we gotta move.

1205
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,670
Brown's expecting Sapp to
walk out of here right now.

1206
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:08,503
- Hold, hold.

1207
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,600
Where's your restroom, Miss?

1208
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,040
- [Richard] Come on Daddy.

1209
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:25,873
- Look, what are you doing?

1210
01:06:25,873 --> 01:06:26,910
He's already suspicious.

1211
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:27,743
He'll know.
- We got to move.

1212
01:06:27,743 --> 01:06:29,160
We can't risk any more lives.

1213
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,080
- Put this on, take your shirt off.

1214
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,730
- [Richard] Where are you?

1215
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:37,030
Come on, come on.

1216
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,240
- John, now look at me.

1217
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,100
You carry the bag out in front
of you so Brown to see it.

1218
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,890
You take the stairs over there.

1219
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,210
When you get to the top of the stairs

1220
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,690
he can't see you anymore.

1221
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,865
That's where Don here is
gonna take your place.

1222
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:51,790
- Now go.

1223
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,140
- No he'll see it's not me.

1224
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,270
- It'll never get that
far, never get that far.

1225
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,253
Our snipers will take him out before then.

1226
01:06:57,253 --> 01:06:59,290
- But look, just let me do it.
- Look Sapp,

1227
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,210
I'm gonna say this you
as straight as I can.

1228
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,230
Either do this my way or
we're gonna get somebody else.

1229
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,499
Okay, button your shirt, come on.

1230
01:07:09,499 --> 01:07:10,970
- Come on Daddy.

1231
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:14,053
(suspenseful music)

1232
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,480
What took you so long?

1233
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,580
- Everybody take position

1234
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,450
but be careful he's watching.

1235
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,796
Team two you get a shot, you take it.

1236
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:28,879
(suspenseful music)

1237
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,420
Come on Daddy, come on baby.

1238
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,370
Come on, come on.

1239
01:08:04,506 --> 01:08:05,970
- He's starting up the stairs now.

1240
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:06,803
Team two.

1241
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,190
- He's pulled back.

1242
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,250
- What's wrong?

1243
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,770
- Wait till he sees me

1244
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:15,500
and I'm gonna over run 'em.

1245
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,570
- Don't do it.

1246
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,970
No, he's following orders.

1247
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:19,920
He's bringing the money,

1248
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,390
you don't have to hurt him.

1249
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,630
- A woman shall leave her father's house

1250
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,050
and claim onto her husband.

1251
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:30,870
- Oh no.

1252
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:31,703
- Forever.

1253
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,493
- No.

1254
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:35,040
- Give me the bag.

1255
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:35,873
- You're sure?

1256
01:08:35,873 --> 01:08:37,010
- I'm sure, Mr. Sapp.

1257
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:39,138
- No don't kill him, no, Daddy.

1258
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:40,210
(Stacy screaming)

1259
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,043
- Stacy!

1260
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:43,000
- Watch out, Daddy, it's a trap.

1261
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,833
- [Jed] Damn it.

1262
01:08:45,546 --> 01:08:47,483
- Let me go, let me go.

1263
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:49,190
- We got him, get him up.

Come on.

(gunshots ringing)
(diners screaming)

1273
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:13,474
- Hold you fire right there.

1274
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:15,303
Hold your fire.

1275
01:09:15,303 --> 01:09:17,634

01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:21,968

(suspenseful music)

1288
01:10:07,017 --> 01:10:08,700
- What the hell is happening?

1289
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,186
- We're still status quo sir.

1290
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:12,686
(door knocks)

1291
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,010

1292
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,694
- [John] Oh, thank God.

1293
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:20,750
I'm glad you're here.

1294
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,870
- Is Stacy okay?

1295
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,950
- What's happening

1296
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,170
- Mr. Harris is assessing the situation.

1297
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,560
We have a right to know.

1298
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,036
I'm sure they'll
communicate with they know.

1299
01:10:28,036 --> 01:10:31,005

1300
01:10:31,005 --> 01:10:33,838

- Hello?

1305
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,170
- Who the hell are you?

1306
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,880
- FBI, Special Agent Harris.

1307
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,940
Brown, let the girl go now.

1308
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,650
We have you surrounded.

1309
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,550
- Let her go, let her go.

1310
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:09,650
- [Stacy] No, he's hurting me now.

1311
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,307
(gunshots ringing)

1312
01:11:11,307 --> 01:11:14,307

1314
01:11:18,332 --> 01:11:23,332
(Dispatcher speaking faintly)
One, three, four, One, three.

1315
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,080
- Look all we want to
know is if she's okay.

1316
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,830
Oh God.

1317
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,240
- Now the truth is at this point

1318
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,360
we're not sure what happened over there.

1319
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,140
- So she she could be.

1320
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,650
- But we're not jumping
to any conclusions.

1321
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:39,990
- Oh my God.

1322
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:43,380
- Now look, we'll be in
this next room right over.

1323
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,429
All right?

1324
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:47,012
(somber music)

1325
01:11:52,009 --> 01:11:54,676
(phone ringing)

1326
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:06,751
(Richard grunting)

1327
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:10,846
- Richard, Richard, come on.

1328
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:13,407
Brown, this is Harris, FBI.

1329
01:12:13,407 --> 01:12:15,443
Richard pick up the phone.

1330
01:12:15,443 --> 01:12:16,985
Come on Brown, pick up the phone.

1331
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:17,880
We have to talk here.

1332
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,713
We can work this out

1333
01:12:18,713 --> 01:12:20,065
but you gotta pick up
the phone and talk to me.

1334
01:12:20,065 --> 01:12:21,248
Come on Richard, pick up the phone.

1335
01:12:21,248 --> 01:12:23,801
We have to talk, come on.

1336
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:25,370
Come on.

1337
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:26,928
This is Harris.

1338
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:27,761
Come on, Richard, pick up the phone.

1339
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:30,594
- Stace, answer the damn phone.

1340
01:12:30,594 --> 01:12:31,427
COme on!

1341
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:32,347
- [Jed] Richard, I gotta know
what's going on in there.

1342
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:33,924
You gotta talk to me now.

1343
01:12:33,924 --> 01:12:36,276
You gotta talk to me Richard.

1344
01:12:36,276 --> 01:12:38,650
Come on Richard, pick up the phone.

1345
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,140
Harris, FBI, pick it up.

1346
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:42,834
- Hello?

1347
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:44,532
- Hello, she's alive.

1348
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,320
Hello, Stacy.

1349
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,670
Stacy, my name is Jed
Harris, I'm with the FBI.

1350
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,902
- [FBI Agent] She's alive.

1351
01:12:51,902 --> 01:12:53,380
- Oh God.
- Oh good.

1352
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,213
Thank God.

1353
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,253
Oh!

1354
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,520
- Stacy, Stacy can I,
can I speak with Richard?

1355
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,670
- They want to talk to you.

1356
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:08,790
He says no.

1357
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:10,630
Okay all right, that's all right Stacy.

1358
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,463
I'll tell you what.

1359
01:13:11,463 --> 01:13:14,320
You, you sort of be our goal
between here, all right?

1360
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:19,420
- I want to talk to my dad and my mom.

1361
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,253
- [Jed] Look Stacy,

1362
01:13:20,253 --> 01:13:24,760
there's not really time
to do that right now.

1363
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,620
- I'm know I'm gonna die anyway.

1364
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,720
- No wait, wait don't
hang up the phone now.

1365
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,980
Hold on Stacy, we'll get
your folks right now.

1366
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,030
They're right in the next
room, just wait a second here.

1367
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:35,070
Hold on stay there.

1368
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:35,903
It's Stacy.

1369
01:13:35,903 --> 01:13:36,736
- Stacy.
- Yeah.

1370
01:13:36,736 --> 01:13:37,569
- [Becky] Stacy.

1371
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:38,940
- We need her to cooperate, okay?

1372
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,880
- [Stacy] Daddy?

1373
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,379
- [Becky And John] Stacy.

1374
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:47,750
(Stacy crying)
(somber music)

1375
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,963
- I am so, so sorry.

1376
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:01,520
I'm so sorry

1377
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:07,320
for everything, Mom, I'm so sorry.

1378
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,561
I love you.

1379
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:11,880
- Oh honey, now you listen to me, okay?

1380
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,940
No matter what's happened,

1381
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,370
I want you to hear me
now, honey, we love you.

1382
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,440
I love you honey.

1383
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,310
- I love you too.

1384
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,000
- I'm so scared.

1385
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,860
- Yeah, I know you are.

1386
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,420
- We know honey.

1387
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:32,380
Listen you need to talk
to Mr. Harris, all right?

1388
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,650
Cooperate with the FBI.

1389
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,530
- It's not gonna do any good.

1390
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,610
- Please Stacy.
- NO, no Stacy,

1391
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,860
Stacy look, honey, do
you do it for me, okay?

1392
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,350
Will you do it for your dad?

1393
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,530
- All right.

1394
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:50,983
- All right.

1395
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,680
- Okay Stace, look I
need a favor from you,

1396
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,920
I want you to ask Richard
if he'll hold his fire

1397
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,470
until I can get my men
out of the parking lot.

1398
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:01,810
Will you do that for me now?

1399
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,610
- They want to know if they can
pull out of the parking lot?

1400
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:09,810
- What will they give us?

1401
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,840
- How do I know?

1402
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,443
- You hungry?

1403
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,760
So am I, tell 'em.

1404
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:30,750
- He said he'll let you do it
if you bring him some food.

1405
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,760
- All right, you tell him he's got a deal.

1406
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,320
- They said it's a deal.

1407
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,117
- One more thing, tell 'em, they screw up

1408
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:48,610
I'm gonna have to kill you.

1409
01:15:52,008 --> 01:15:54,330
(somber music)

1410
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:59,330
- He said, if you screw up
he's gonna have to kill me.

1411
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:08,073
(engines revving)

1412
01:16:08,073 --> 01:16:11,156
(suspenseful music)

1413
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:17,840
- DO you have a shot?

1414
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,113
- [Don] Maybe.

1415
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,163
- Damn.

1416
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,330
- Send in the food.

1417
01:16:45,566 --> 01:16:46,983
- Go on, open it.

1418
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,880
Eat, go on eat.

1419
01:17:00,588 --> 01:17:01,421
Eat!

1420
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:08,330
Give some to the cat, too.

1421
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:13,150
- Aren't you hungry?

1422
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,060
- Just keep eating.

1423
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,980
You have to eat to keep your strength up.

1424
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,980
- How much energy you think dying takes?

1425
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:24,070
Go on.

1426
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:26,653
(somber music)

1427
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:38,747
- Well they've sent in the food

1428
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:42,302
and they've established contact.

1429
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,830
- So they can negotiate?

1430
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:46,860
Right?

1431
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,690
- [John] That's right son.

1432
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:50,472
- I want to pray.

1433
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:53,222
(peaceful music)

1434
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:57,663
Um.

1435
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,650
I know we're not a very religious family

1436
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,970
and I hope that you didn't
think we're hypocrites

1437
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,970
or anything but Lord please,
please hear our prayer

1438
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:16,810
and let our Stacy be safe.

1439
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:20,827
- Amen.

1440
01:18:20,827 --> 01:18:22,906
- [Johnny] Amen.

1441
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,009
- Amen.

1442
01:18:25,009 --> 01:18:28,009
(crickets chirping)

1443
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:33,908
(suspenseful music)

1444
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:46,588
(phone ringing)

1445
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,470
- Did you really think I'd fall for that?

1446
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:22,276
(gun clicks)

1447
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:35,415
(gentle music)

1448
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:56,810
(people chattering)

1449
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:58,140
- Details are still sketchy

1450
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,420
about the hostage drama

1451
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,810
that has been unfolding the past 12 hours

1452
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,380
at this downtown motel.

1453
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,390
Neither police nor FBI will comment

1454
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,990
but KCRP has learned that the gunman

1455
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,080
is believed to be a criminal

1456
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,200
with a history of mental disturbance

1457
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,940
and that he has allegedly
kidnapped an Illinois girl

1458
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,194
and is holding her for.

1459
01:20:15,194 --> 01:20:18,630
(Television thudding)

1460
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,773
- No, no Richard, the power just went out.

1461
01:20:20,773 --> 01:20:21,750
(Richard grunts)
Ow!

1462
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,765
- Get up, get up!

1463
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:24,598
(Stacy whimpering)

1464
01:20:24,598 --> 01:20:27,440
Stace, Stacy, I'm sorry.

1465
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,570
Honey, I'm sorry.

1466
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:33,380
- Please no, please let's surrender.

1467
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,450
- Surrender?

1468
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:36,560
- [Stacy] Please, before
someone gets hurt.

1469
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,110
- That's what happens in war, come on.

1470
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,530
- I'm not in a war.

1471
01:20:43,066 --> 01:20:44,940
Please, not if you let me.

1472
01:20:47,094 --> 01:20:48,150
(Stacy crying)

1473
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,070
- Look honey, look at me.

1474
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,350
I told you, didn't I?

1475
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:55,210
Forever, didn't I?

1476
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,280
Come on, take your gun.

1477
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,520
Come on.

1478
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,353
Take it.

1479
01:21:02,353 --> 01:21:03,990
- No!

1480
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:06,950
- Stace, it's an order, take it.

1481
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:11,449
- No, no.

1482
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:12,660
Kill me.

1483
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,493
Come on.

1484
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,093
Come on.

1485
01:21:16,093 --> 01:21:18,990
We're gonna die together anyway.

1486
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,919
I don't want them to do it.

1487
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:22,060
I want you.

1488
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:25,320
Come on, please.

1489
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,680
Please I can't take it anymore.

1490
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:32,873
Please.

1491
01:21:33,928 --> 01:21:38,928
(Stacy crying)
(gentle music)

1492
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:44,050
- No, I'm crazy.

1493
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,380
I've been crazy for years.

1494
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:54,060
Died, I died long before
I before I met you,

1495
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:58,943
and dying here, don't mean nothing to me.

1496
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:05,660
Oh but you, no woman's ever been willing

1497
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:11,020
to lay down their life, not for me,

1498
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,900
not for the likes of me.

1499
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:24,340
And if you die, then their
won't be nobody to remember,

1500
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,483
will there?

1501
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:35,693
I really do love you, remember me, okay?

1502
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,259
Forever.

1503
01:22:39,259 --> 01:22:42,974
- Forever.

1504
01:22:42,974 --> 01:22:45,557
(gentle music)

1505
01:22:51,736 --> 01:22:54,319
(Stacy crying)

1506
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,333
- You there?

1507
01:23:04,228 --> 01:23:05,061
- [Jed] We're right here Richard,

1508
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:09,943
what can we do for ya?

1509
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:14,943
- She's coming out.

1510
01:23:23,446 --> 01:23:26,029
(Stacy crying)

1511
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,093
- He's agreed to let her go.

1512
01:23:39,093 --> 01:23:40,051
- Oh God, let's go.

1513
01:23:40,051 --> 01:23:40,884
- Oh my god.

1514
01:23:40,884 --> 01:23:42,240
- Stay here Johnny.

1515
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,073
- [Officer] Just right as we are.

1516
01:23:43,073 --> 01:23:43,906
Come on let's go.

1517
01:23:43,906 --> 01:23:44,762
- [Officer] Line it up.

1518
01:23:44,762 --> 01:23:49,762
Let's move, let's go.

1519
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,657
(phone ringing)

1520
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:06,167
- Hello Richard, may I
speak with Stacy, please?

1521
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,783
Hello Stacy?

1522
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:19,210
I need you to walk over to the door

1523
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:22,010
and come out the door with
your hands up over your head.

1524
01:24:22,986 --> 01:24:24,036
Do you understand me?

1525
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,870
- What about my kitten?

1526
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:33,690
- Stacy you'll just have to
leave the kitten for now.

1527
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:35,470
- No, no, no, no, no, he'll die.

1528
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,780
- All right Stacy, do this
for me will you please?

1529
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:40,070
When you come out the door

1530
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,440
hold the kitten in both hands

1531
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,540
but hold it out away from your body, okay?

1532
01:24:52,613 --> 01:24:54,882
(Becky and John sigh)

1533
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:57,465
(gentle music)

1534
01:25:05,176 --> 01:25:08,093
- What do you want me to tell them?

1535
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,650
- Tell 'em the truth,

1536
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,720
tell 'em I loved you.

1537
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:17,994
- Remember, what you told me?

1538
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,630
Never let the bastards grind you down.

1539
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:29,760
Oh God, I wish I could
take all your pain away.

1540
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:39,210
Please, please don't die.

1541
01:25:40,248 --> 01:25:42,831
(gentle music)

1542
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:11,642
(cat meowing)

1543
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,360
- Here she comes.

1544
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,970
Get her downstairs,

1545
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:35,590
everybody else hold your positions.

1546
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,700
If that man makes a move you take him out.

1547
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,700
- [Don] My pleasure.

1548
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:43,160
(gentle music)

1549
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,286
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

1550
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:53,546
Come on, go, go.

1551
01:26:53,546 --> 01:26:58,546
- Walk fast.
- Come on, come on, your free.

1552
01:27:05,629 --> 01:27:08,629
(somber rock music)

1553
01:27:39,091 --> 01:27:41,360
(gun clicks)

1554
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,950
- I am telling you he will surrender.

1555
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:45,390
- Just take him out.

1556
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,790
- Stacy, what makes you
so sure he'll surrender?

1557
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:49,950
- Because he's not evil.

1558
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:52,083
- He fooled me.

1559
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:55,620
- He's been hurt all his life.

1560
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:57,911
- Stacy!

1561
01:27:57,911 --> 01:28:00,494
(gentle music)

1562
01:28:04,055 --> 01:28:04,888
Thank god.

1563
01:28:04,888 --> 01:28:06,070
- Oh God.

1564
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:08,300
Honey, it's good to see you.

1565
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,633
Oh Lord.

1566
01:28:18,297 --> 01:28:21,380
(suspenseful music)

1567
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,473
- Oh yeah.

1568
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,243
Bye-bye.

1569
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,400
- Nobody fires till I give the word.

1570
01:28:46,937 --> 01:28:48,820
- I wouldn't do this.

1571
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:49,653
I realize that.

1572
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:52,750
- [Reporter] The gunman is
still holding his weapon

1573
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:55,482
as the FBI continues to go negotiate.

1574
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:56,669
- Shoot him, shoot him.

1575
01:28:56,669 --> 01:28:57,874
- No!

1576
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,957
(suspenseful music)

1577
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:08,390
- Richard, Richard this is Harris.

1578
01:29:10,009 --> 01:29:13,300
All right Richard, don't
move, don't do anything,

1579
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:14,420
you just hear me now.

1580
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,690
I know you're hurting up there,

1581
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,690
there's no reason you got to die.

1582
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:24,720
Come on, Stacy's safe.

1583
01:29:41,066 --> 01:29:43,649
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

1584
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,000
Richard put down that weapon.

1585
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,410
Just come to the door with your

1586
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:53,100
hands over your head Richard.

1587
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:58,310
Now you let Stacy go so
I know you're a good man.

1588
01:30:00,735 --> 01:30:03,100
You got a lot of years left,
do something with it Richard.

1589
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:03,933
Come on.

1590
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,160
- Richard, please.

1591
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,800
Oh Richard, please don't die.

1592
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,873
- Come on now.

1593
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:22,873
(suspenseful music)

1594
01:30:35,835 --> 01:30:38,668
(peaceful music)

1595
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:48,137
Come on, that's right.

1596
01:30:55,748 --> 01:31:00,748
That's right.

1597
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,454
- [Officer] Stay right there, okay.

1598
01:31:11,454 --> 01:31:14,537
(handcuffs clinking)

1599
01:31:19,221 --> 01:31:22,048
- He's not all bad.

1600
01:31:22,048 --> 01:31:27,048
- None of us are honey.

1601
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:33,463
(people shouting)

1602
01:31:36,215 --> 01:31:38,147
- [Reporter] Oh Richard.

1603
01:31:38,147 --> 01:31:40,980
(people shouting)

1604
01:31:44,508 --> 01:31:45,829
- [Reporter] Richard.

1605
01:31:45,829 --> 01:31:47,184
(people shouting)

1606
01:31:47,184 --> 01:31:48,851
- Remember, forever.

1607
01:31:51,584 --> 01:31:53,115
- Oh.

1608
01:31:53,115 --> 01:31:55,789
- [Johnny] What'd he do to you?

1609
01:31:55,789 --> 01:31:56,622
- Nothing.

1610
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,682
He just loved me.

1611
01:32:08,924 --> 01:32:12,053
- Come on, honey, let's, let's go home.

1612
01:32:12,053 --> 01:32:14,636
(gentle music)

1613
01:32:19,622 --> 01:32:22,455
(people shouting)

1614
01:32:25,145 --> 01:32:26,194
- [John] Please.

1615
01:32:26,194 --> 01:32:28,471
- Step aside, step aside.

1616
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:29,402
Back, back.

1617
01:32:29,402 --> 01:32:30,235
Move along.

1618
01:32:30,235 --> 01:32:32,666
I'm not gonna tell you
guys, get back, get back.

1619
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:33,499
