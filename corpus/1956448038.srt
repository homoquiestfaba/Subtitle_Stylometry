born to feast...

00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,762
This is not a drill.

48
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:29,628
His Majesty has requested
an audience.

49
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,195

you will rise and genuflect.

51
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:37,963
you've made me lose my lunch.

52
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,997
You will answer
to Mufasa

53
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,629
for missing the ceremony
this morning.

54
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,999
I answer to no one.

55
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,997
Scar? Scar. Scar.

56
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,264
No, no.
Don't look at me like that.

57
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,831
Are you hungry, Zazu?

58
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,731
Perhaps we could have
a bite together!

You can't eat me!

61
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,597
It is forbidden to eat a
member of the king's court!

62
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,165
Ow! No, please! Stop it!

MUFASA: Scar!

64
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,832
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

65
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:16,702
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

66
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,869
Was that today?

67
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,800
Must've slipped
my mind.

68
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,701
Of course
I meant no disrespect

69
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:32,002
towards His Majesty
or Sarabi.

70
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:38,672
As you know, I have tremendous
respect for the queen.

71
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,701
As the king's brother,

72
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,636
you should've been
first in line.

73
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,770
- I was first in line.

75
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,937
That is, until the precious
prince arrived.

76
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:54,204
Don't turn your back
on me, Scar.

77
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,770
Oh, no, Mufasa,

78
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:58,037
perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

79
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,204
(GROWLS)

80
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,738
MUFASA: Is that a challenge?

81
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,107
I wouldn't dream
of challenging you again.

82
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,273
A wise decision.

83
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,672
You are no match
for His Royalness.

84
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:14,839
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

85
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,705
But when it comes
to brute strength,

86
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:19,273
I'm afraid
my big brother...

87
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,773
will always rule.

88
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:23,240
Not always, Scar.

89
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,706
One day, it'll be
my son who rules.

90
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,640
Simba will be your king.

91
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,077
Then long live the king.

92
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:37,642
- What am I gonna do with him?
- ZAZU: Oh, come on.

93
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,041
We both know
he should've been

94
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:41,308
expelled from the
Pride Lands long ago.

95
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,209
He's my brother, Zazu.

96
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,642
This is his home.

97
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:48,043
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

98
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:49,943
Well, there's one
in every family, sire.

99
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:52,577
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

100
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,310
He slammed his head
into trees,

101
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:56,743
and our beaks
aren't built for it.

102
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,677
He was concussed regularly.
Oh, you've gone.

103
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,847
Uh, sire, coming back!

114
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,225
Your son's awake.

115
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,292
Before sunrise,

116
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:14,790
he's your son.

117
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,625
Come on, Dad, let's go.

118
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:18,225

to go up here.

Look, Simba.

133
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:06,163

as ruler...

One day, Simba...

the sun will set
on my time here...

140
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,735
and will rise with you
as the new king.

141
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:28,831
All of this
will belong to me?

142
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,933
It belongs to no one,

143
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:33,567
but will be yours
to protect.

144
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,867
A great responsibility.

145
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,933
SIMBA: Everything
the light touches?

146
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:42,000
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

147
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:43,768
And that mountain?

148
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,199
And beyond
those shadows?

149
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,168
You must not go there, Simba.

150

But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

151
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,867
Take any territory.

152
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:56,101
While others search
for what they can take...

153
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:59,171
a true king searches
for what he can give.

154
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:08,103
Everything you see
exists together

155
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:11,070
in a delicate balance.

156
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:14,670
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

157
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,836
and respect
all the creatures...

158
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:20,903
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

159
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,972
SIMBA: But, Dad,
don't we eat the antelope?

160
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:27,772
MUFASA: Yes, Simba.
But let me explain.

161
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:32,038
When we die, our bodies
become the grass...

162
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,073
and the antelope
eat the grass...

163
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:40,272
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

164
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,639
- Sire!
- Morning, Zazu.

165
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:44,205
Do you have
the morning report?

00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,806
Yes, sire.

The buzz
from the bees...

170
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,073
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

00:13:58,344 --> 00:13:59,807

the shadows...

177
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:05,609
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

178
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,709
ZAZU: The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

179
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:07,943
and now the baboons
are going ape.

180
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,176
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

181
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,310
That's what I say.

182
