00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,704
And I don't.

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,375
I'd like to be settled
in New York,

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,974
Iike, have--at least have
an apartment,

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,985
you know what I mean?

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,611
- [laughs]
Right.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,779
Well, yeah, all those things.

8
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,254
- Little things like that,
you know?

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,253
- Best place I can think
to start, right now.

10
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,851
- Okay, so you think
we're going to be able

11
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,862
to talk to someone there?

12
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,056
- I can talk to anybody.

13
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,327
I could fucking sell water
to a drowning man.

14
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,027
- I don't know.

15
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,365
I mean, I don't really trust

16
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,564
either of y'all's opinion
on this, really.

17
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,768
- Hey, I'm not saying
that we should be here either.

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,776
- You assholes watch
too many movies.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,302
Like, "Ooh, we're gonna get
carjacked in the hood, yo."

20
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,144
They're probably
just gonna think you're hot,

21
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,276
and, like, maybe they'll give us
stuff for free--or more stuff.

22
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,683
I'll be cute for them, fuck it.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,415
I could run in, or there's
like--there's some guys.

24
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,547
- No, don't get out.
Don't get out.

25
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,715
Don't get out.
- Are you sure?

26
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,724
- No wait.
Hold on.

27
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,850
This dude's coming over.

28
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,485
- He's kind of looking at us,
right?

29
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,586
- Let's see what he has to say.

30
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,926
- Fuck it, I'm going to talk
to him.

31
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,555
Let's just see what he's doing.

32
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,565
- Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,396
- Hey, what's going on?

34
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,062
- I see it in your face.
I got the good stuff.

35
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,127
- All right, now.

36
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,071
- Vocaine, pills,
whatever you want.

37
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,733
- You got ecstasy?
- Yeah, I got ecstasy.

38
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,106
The camera cool then--

39
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,235
- No, I'm not the police, man.

40
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,711
I mean, I'm just--

- You cool with that?

- Okay, no, that's--
- What y'all want to get?

45
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,715
- I'm saying, like, I need,
like, a lot of coke.

46
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,016
- And some rolls.

47
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,682
- Do you have any rolls?
- Yeah, I got rolls.

48
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,883
You said you need a lot of coke.

49
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,655
I got a goddamn eight ball

50
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,457
- How much is that?
- $1 25.

00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,929

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,374
- Them new boys up the street,

182
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,886
- This can't be no dope, man.
It can't be this big, now.

183
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,013
Whoo.

185
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,480
Who got it like this?

186
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,787
- Some nigga hooked me up

187
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,351
- Where he stayin'?
What street this on?

188
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,794
- Right up the street.
I swear to God.

189
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,990
- What?

190
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,261
You might want to--

191
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,858

00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,868

River Street, I swear to God.

198
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,678
- And you don't know

199
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,773
- I don't even know 'em, bro.
Motherfucker came to me.

200
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,306
You know, I'm for the boys
in the bluff.

201
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,615
But these new folk,
fresh from Tennessee.

202
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,450
They don't know shit.
They don't know nobody.

203
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,582
Got it.
Guaranteed.

204
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,921
I seen it.
- Oh, shit.

205
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,620
You seen it?
You made sure it was there?

206
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,127
- I bought it for myself.

207
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,290
Told me don't fuck with nobody.
Don't let nobody know.

208
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,765
Got everything you want, bro.
- D.J.

209
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,290
- You say you want to make
the move, bro.

210
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,132
It's time to make
the motherfuckin' move, man.

211
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,296
- I appreciate that, D.J.

212
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,635
I need to holler at y'all.

213
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,663
E. and J., come let me
holler at y'all.

214
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,604
E. and J., this the biz, right?

215
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,775
You heard D.J. say them boys
really flexin',

216
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,842
but we don't know how true
that is.

217
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,353
We want to make sure.

218
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,719
We don't want to go nowhere
where we're playin' at--

219
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,781
and they ain't talkin' about,
man--exactly.

220
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,554
So this how we'll do it.

221
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,322
You two go up there,

222
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,923
just typical, like y'all
walkin' past, down the street.

223
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,092
They say something to you,
flirt with them a little.

224
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,362
- Holler at them.
- Just see.

225
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,165
If they for real,
they gonna show you the dope.

226
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,432
They gonna show you the bank.

227
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,337
They gonna let you know
that they gettin' money.

228
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,864
If they flexin',
y'all gonna know.

229
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,774
Because it might be time for us
to go back to work,

230
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,971
if you know what I mean.

231
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,570
So I need y'all
to go check that out for me.

232
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,104
Come back and let me know.
- I'll holler at you.

233
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,211
- Man, they comin' back down
the street they're goin' up.

234
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,984

235
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,721

236
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,458
Damn, I know damn well niggas

00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,988

00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,761

00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,306

00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,037
- They got it.
- Oh, shit.

244
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,374
You ain't got to say no more,

00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,471
That's all we need.
That's all we need.

00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,574
Count up what we got.

336
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,942
Everything's level.
Who got a lighter?

337
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,504
Lighter, lighter.
Somebody light this lighter.

338
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,848
Oh, one ounce, two ounces,
three ounces.

339
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:34,588
Six ounces, seven ounces,
eight ounces, nine ounces,

340
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,652
ten ounces.

341
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,030
Ten ounces and a couple bags,
you know, something nice.

342
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,501
And some for the personal use.
[laughs]

343
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,628
You know what I mean?

344
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,160
- Yeah, that looks great,
right there.

345
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,537
[all speaking at once]

346
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,041
- Aww.

347
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,907
- Where the camera at?
Where the game now?

348
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,572
For sure, we gonna bet plenty
more than that, real talk.

349
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,081
- Hold on, man.

350
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,549
- 21.

351
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,381
- Throw it down.
Throw it down.

352
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,443
Throw it down.

353
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,320
Throw it.
Throw it.

354
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,415
- Four, Trey.

355
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,427
- This how we do it, man,
24 hours, seven days a week.

356
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,826
You know what I mean?
You know, this still me.

357
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,126
Hey, boy, they say that boy
Frank just got murdered up here.

358
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,893
I came up here to see him
layin' on the ground.

359
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,400
J's Frank, tall Frank.

360
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,800
Man, they cut him, some nigga,
I don't even know.

361
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,032
Yeah, last game Frank.
- Somebody just shot him?

362
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,905
- No, stabbed him in one of them
arteries, yeah, right there.

363
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,170
Right there in the middle
of the street,

364
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,734
and there's somebody blood
on the wall.

365
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,405
The police said something
about a dealer.

366
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,970
We just tryin' to see
what they gonna do.

367
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,538
Did they leave?
No, they ain't, not yet.

368
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,346
Until they say something.
Then we gonna deal.

369
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,820
We just lookin',
just like everybody else.

370
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,015
No big deal.

371
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:41,117
Is she walkin' toward us?
Uh-oh.

372
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,457
Yeah, man, we got
to see what's up.

373
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,826
Frank was a good friend.

374
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,161
- You see all that blood,
all that red shit on the ground?

375
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,324
- On the wall right there.

376
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,095
Hell yeah, he's fixin' to go.

377
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,000
Look at his shirt.
He look like he been fightin'.

378
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,765
Like shit been real.
And look at this old man.

379
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,329
They ain't took him out
in no handcuffs.

380
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,466
- No, they might have just
snatched the shit out of him.

381
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,942
- Wasn't nobody around here
but them.

382
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,502
They said they leave
for the night there.

383
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,343
Yeah, that's blood
from all the way down there.

384
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,871
Hell yeah, boy, that's blood.

385
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,180
I won't tell you no lie, boy.
Nigga just got killed, Frank.

386
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,914
There go another one.
Yeah, that might be official.

387
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,046
It might be official.

388
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,422
Frank done kicked the bucket
on these fools.

389
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,051
Like I say, man,
it just a regular day,

390
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,356
you know what I mean,
in the hood,

391
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,623
you know what I mean?

392
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,324
Nigga just got killed.
That ain't nothing.

393
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,492
Everybody from the goddamn--
you know what I mean?

394
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,297
Back to your regularly
scheduled program,

395
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,302
you know what I mean?

396
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,667
It don't matter, though.

397
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,898
We can walk on down
a little bit,

398
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,931
by the liquor store,
by the corner.

399
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,273
Show you the spot where
my brother got killed at.

400
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,938
You know, like,
when a motherfucker die,

401
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,742
or when a homey
was a team member,

402
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,113
you give 'em some bells,
or you give 'em some goddamn--

403
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,141
some flowers or something,
you know what I mean?

404
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,279
You put it right there,
just to remember the spot,

405
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,845
you know what I mean?

406
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,220
- Frank, that's fucked up.

407
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,487
- Yeah, Frank--fucked up.
This is my brother, right here.

408
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,391
His name was Snow.
"R.I.P. Snow."

409
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,952
He got killed right here
on this corner.

410
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,327
He got shot right there.

411
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,161
He came right here,
but he ain't die right here.

412
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,292
He got shot three times.

413
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,063
He fucked around
and made it to the hospital,

414
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,467
you know, and everything,

415
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,597
but when they put the medicine
and all that shit in him,

416
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,129
that made him die,
you know what I mean?

417
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,436
But at the same time,

418
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,568
he probably would have pulled
through, but, you know,

419
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,908
God got the answer
to everything.

420
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,208
But, yeah, he died right here.

421
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,807
We put the flowers and all that
out there, every year.

422
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,978
That's my real brother,
Antonio James Snow.

423
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,486
This is my strip, right here.

424
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,012
I walked this strip
for 20 straight years, man.

425
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,991
From right here--
this is where it all began.

426
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,788
My granddad stayed there first.

427
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,988
I remember when I first got
introduced to James P.,

428
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,519
when I first ever came
to the Bluff,

429
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,826
this is where I was, right here.

430
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,958
My first shooting

431
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,797
was right here in front
of this door right here.

432
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,700
Nigga tried to rob me
and my brother, Snow.

433
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,726
I'll never forget it.

434
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,170
Snow had a.22
with two bullets in it,

435
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,571
the nigga came, right,
and he ran--

436
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,905
he robbed my brother
right there.

437
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,307
They had the car parked
right here.

438
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,141
He ran out--the driver,
and my brother's like,

439
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,544
"Shoot him, shoot him,
shoot him."

440
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,673
I was spooked.
Shot the two times--"bow, bow."

441
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,308
Tried my best to hit him,
but missed him,

442
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,216
but nigga know not to ever
try that again.

443
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,222
And then, boy, I got my rank
right then like this.

444
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,621
This here bust,

445
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,522
so motherfucker know
not to fuck with me no more.

446
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,584
After that, it was straight
really ruckus with me,

447
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,459
but at the same time,
I grew older,

448
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,793
went to jail a couple times.

449
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,493
Right here is where my baby mama
got killed.

450
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,524
Her name was Tashiba Matthews.

451
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,163
A nigga shot her, hatin',
you know what I mean,

452
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,570
because of some bullshit.

453
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,073
And the nigga was just
geeked up,

454
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,804
had done been awoke
three, four days, trippin',

455
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,937
Iike, goddamn on that thing.

456
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,776
So goddamn nigga
like this here,

457
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,145
so when it all boiled down,

458
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,776
it's like, boy,
nigga walked down the street

459
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,683
with like a goddamn
semiautomatic,

460
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,019
and she was just walkin' to ask
him what happened between them,

461
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,251
and he just started shootin'.

462
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,657
Shot her, killed her right here.

463
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,457
Goddamn blood ran from right
here all along the ground, man.

464
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,329
She was a girl, and she was cool
as a motherfucker.

465
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,230
She didn't take no shit
from nobody.

466
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,734
- Hey, what you doin' that for?

467
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,236
- Oh, I told her I was gonna
make a book.

468
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,363
Told her I got the book,
I'll write about my whole life,

469
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,566
about everything.

470
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,040
- Put me in.
- I just tried to put you in.

471
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,770
You thought it was the police
and all that.

472
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,368
You want to be in it?

473
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,504
- Hey!

474
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,344

Hey.

00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,249
- That's to eat.

Cook that up in the microwave.

00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,425
Fuck, let's go.

00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,422
Yo, yo, yeah, y'all,

482
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,626
- Oh, the baby's back there.

483
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,157
- Hey, man, y'all hold on
with all this.

484
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,430
- Hold on, hold on.

485
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,028
What's up?

486
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,334
- I'm on my way.
Just be patient.

487
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,136
- Hell yeah, all day,

488
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,939
You outside?
All right, for sure.

00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,743
- I'm gonna hit you right back.

491
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,839
Something will go down, goddamn.
I'll be there.

492
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,476
Just chill.
All right, bye.

493
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,746
What's up, fellas?

494
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,617
Goddamn, y'all had me
a little bit worried.

495
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,021
I was like, "Goddamn, I hope
them boys ain't got lost

496
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,184
on Georgia 400
or something like that."

497
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,354
- Hey, man, long road,
no trees look like, man.

498
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,920
Whoa, what's up with the camera?

499
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,932

They're my people.

00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,359
I'll explain it to you later.

502
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,597
- All right.
- It's cool, though.

503

Nigga know who stay strapped.

00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:17,715
24 hours, seven days
a motherfuckin' week.

607

- Don't do her like that.

622
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,313
I wish I would have--

623
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,913
if I would have known
everybody was here,

624
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:02,086
I would have been able to bring

625
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,617
I brought this for you.

626
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,724

[engine turns over]

647
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,491
Yeah, man, I had to make

648
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,759
to let them folks know,

00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,028
"Hey, hey, hey, I love my baby,

650
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,058
Everything good."

651

I got a little something,

652
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,605
We can have a couple drinks,
you know what I mean?

653
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,371
You know, like the players
always used to do.

654
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,937
- No, I got it.

655
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,311
Where you at, bro?

656
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,338

you know what I mean?

660
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,554
We lookin' for the real one,
you know what I mean?

661
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,320
This one right here
just a little something.

662
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,091
From beginning to the end,
nits or grits for life, yo.

663
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,461
- Ah, oh.

664
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,591
- This I'm allowed right now.
Just a little something.

665
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,123
- Somebody got another blunt?

666
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,965
- We can't do too much flexin'
and puttin' on.

667
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,561
I bought a new watch,
you know what I mean?

668
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,072
It wasn't none too tough.

669
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,473
I didn't want to just put
no 24s and that on the car,

670
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,908
big old flex so they'll
be wonderin'

671
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,741
where the money came from,
you know what I mean?

672
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,713
That just was fucked up

00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,378
We got those fuckin' niggas.

845
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,179
Let's go.
Take your masks off.

846
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,379
Everybody out.

847
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,320
Take all the hoodies
and everything off.

848
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,755
Get the gloves.

849
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,692
We got to throw
all this shit away.

850
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,490
Yeah, just throw it.
Throw it out the window.

851
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,553
- What about the gun?

852
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,858
- No, we got to keep the guns
on us.

853
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,456
Let's go.
We got to keep it strapped.

854
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:02,932
Hell yeah, so we run
into trouble.

855
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,559
That's for when we get
pulled over.

856
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,263
Turn right there.

857
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,794
We good.
Fuck them niggas.

858
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,170
Everything went smooth.

859
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,175
Yeah, that's good enough.

860
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,205
[coughing]

861
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,979
Yeah, that good enough.

862
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,288
That's good shit too.
Mm-mm.

863
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,556
Boy, that's it.
Goddamn, man.

864
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,994
- Got the power of Red in there,
man.

865
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,554
- Them nigga would.

866
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,964
They say they from out of town.
Whatever, we don't give a fuck.

867
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,558
The deal is done,
and the cake been baked.

868
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:38,899
They need to come on
with the drama

869
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:39,961
or whatever they gonna do.

870
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,438
Other than that, fuck 'em.
We ball.

871
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,464
It's Curtis, Grandma.

872
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,105
Hey, Grandma.

873
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,945
How you be, Grandma?
I need a big favor.

874
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,382
- What?

875
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:58,048
- I need you to tell the camera
about Dad, about dope, you know?

876
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,523
About how long you been
staying here.

877
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,856
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

878
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:07,593
- I been here since 1 936.
- 1 936, the same house.

879
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,261
- All raised up here.

880
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,465
- This is a picture of my daddy,
right there.

881
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,996
- And that's him on the piano.

882
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,841
- There's my uncle.
- Ain't Curtis over there?

883
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,315
- Mm-hmm.

884
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,840
Yo, my dad.
It's his mom.

885
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,088
- I sure wish you'd told me
he was comin'.

886
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,785
I would have
straightened up some, Curtis,

887
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,885
and moved some of
all these things.

888
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,691
- No, it's straight.
It's straight, Grandma.

889
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,220
- No, it ain't neither.

890
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,756
I don't like pictures like this.

891
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,928
I like to be straightened out,
honey.

892
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,666
That's why the scripture
teaches us

893
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,971
that if my people
that are called by my name

894
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,640
would armor themselves,
pray, seek His face,

895
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,412
and turn from their wicked ways,
then they will hear from heaven.

896
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,443
That means you will hear
from Him.

897
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,980
He will bless you more,

898
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,823
because there's nothin'
out in the street but trouble.

899
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,353
And death--
you're guaranteed of that.

900
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,299
- Yeah, well,
we seen that with Tonio.

901
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,167
- You can have that
though eternal life

902
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,831
by knowing Jesus.

903
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:22,965
So you got to straighten up.

904
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,498
We got to get you a job,
and be a man.

905
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:31,413
God done let you live
over 25 years.

906
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,542
25 more, you'll be 50,

907
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,486
if He lets you live
to get that old.

908
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,820
Some of 'em don't even
get that old.

909
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,518
Look at Tonio, didn't get to 22.

910
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,924
- I was just gonna say, 22.

911
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,954
- Because if he had known
that he was gonna get killed,

912
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,363
he would have changed his ways.

913
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,995
He wouldn't have been
in the predicament he was in.

914
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,061
But that's the trouble.

915
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,006
We don't ever know
where death is.

916
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,602
David says just one step
between you and death.

917
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,307
He said, "One step
between me and death,"

918
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,282
so that's us, too.
It's just one step.

919
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,479
And you never know when you're
makin' that last step.

920
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,612
- That shit scary.

921
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,917
Gonna take a drink.

922
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:15,687
Word up in the end.
This shit over.

923
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,686
Oh, we laughin' at her.
This shit ain't funny, but, boy.

924
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,528
See, I see how she look when she
sayin' it at you.

925
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,329
But listenin' to that shit,
takin' that shit,

926
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,528
I been listenin' to that shit--

927
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,833
ain't anything
I made a deal for.

928
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,840
[hip-hop music]

929
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:37,872
# #

930
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,633
- You want to hit that blunt,
bro?

931
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,366
- It's game over.

932
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,570
You get no cocaine.

933
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,043
I'm on the new rule.

934
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,536
No cash, not gonna get it.

935
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,548
- This it right here.

936
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,140
- Six.
- Hell yeah.

937
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,651
- There ain't gonna be no six.

938
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,085
- Says who?

939
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,682
- We got to make sure everything
bagged up.

940
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,885
'Cause we stashin' it.

941
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,393
- We chillin' on now, man.

942
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,293
- Ain't nothin' but fifties
for cocaine.

943
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,923
That's why we're baggin' up.

944
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,057
Nothin' but fifties.

945
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,034
I read that--

946
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,697
It's easy to see, this how
this shit go in the street:

947
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,535
Either you gonna be the one
that doin' it,

948
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,302
or it gonna get done
to your ass.

949
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,866
It got to happen
one of them way.

950
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,038
But it ain't got one of those
on and off,

951
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,640
because I was doin' odd jobs,

952
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,674
and, you know, tryin' to goddamn
see what the move's gonna be.

953
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,345
That shit wasn't for me.

954
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,649
And then I'm thinkin'
in my head,

955
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,680
"It's so easy for me to
just, 'Get up,"'

956
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,691
you know what I mean?

957
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,192
When niggas see that gun,

958
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,127
it can be fake or real,
if you know how to handle it,

959
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,652
man, them motherfuckers
gonna get up.

960
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,130
Motherfucker don't want
to get shot.

961
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,962
That's the scariest thing
in the world, a gun,

962
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,230
dead in your motherfuckin' face,
the barrel part.

963
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,830
And you don't know who that is
on the other side of it.

964
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:12,138
Yeah, I got my name right there.
I just got her name.

965
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,507
- Let me see if for the camera.

966
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,809
- "R.I.P. Trice,"
with a sack in the middle.

967
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,338
I'm the only nigga you know,
still,

968
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,613
got a crack sack
tattooed on him,

969
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,619
you know what I mean?

970
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,847
Dedicated to this shit.

971
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,879
'Cause this is what really
made me.

972
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,447
If I don't know nothin'
about this shit,

973
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,926
I wouldn't goddamn have nothin'
to eat all them days

974
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,428
when I ain't had no job

975
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,157
or my mom and my daddy
weren't workin'.

976
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,892
That shit helped us out
a whole lot,

977
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,992
so I'm motherfuckin' sayin'
dope ain't always been bad.

978
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,299
Helped my family out,
so I really like to know that,

979
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,398
"Hey, well, drugs kill, now,
but at the same time,

980
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,739
"shit, they also do
help you out.

981
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,437
"They pay your rent
if you ain't got no job,

982
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,139
or they do this."

983
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,807
There's a lot of shit
you can do with drugs,

984
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:51,872
so, you know.

985
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,349
Shit still here.
Could be still here.

986
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,874
It's a still life.

987
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,218
Still smokin', still drinkin',
still standin' in lines.

988
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,316
Still takin' care of children
or whatever.

989
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,384
Still strapped.

990
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:08,296
We just still.
We just still.

991
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,630
Hell yeah.

992
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:16,664
We need to go and see
what they talkin' about.

993
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,072
Bro.

994
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,806
Guess we waitin' on them
clock to strike, and boom.

995
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,835
You know what I mean?

996
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,347
We pack up.

997
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,283
We still got the goddamn--
don't let me forget

998
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,752
that we got to walk around to
the other spot,

999
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,278
'cause I got to get something
out of there.

1000
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,847
Bro, I'ma fuck with you.

1001
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,485
Got them guys don't handle
their business, man.

1002
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,018
But goddamn now, I'm gonna
keep everything under control.

1003
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,158
- Yo, they say the nigga
gonna be waitin',

1004
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,430
so we got to hurry up.

1005
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,633
Lock the door, bro.
Make sure you lock the door.

1006
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,609
You got to make sure
this shit goes down.

1007
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,111
All the way down, man.

1008
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,637
Yeah, man, police.
Shit.

1009
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,419
Ah, shit.

1010
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,050
- Meet that nigga up there,
goddamn, how that is.

1011
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:13,257
- Get the hell on.
- I know, man.

1012
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,764
- Crazy-ass shit, man.

1013
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,664

1031
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,232

00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,742

00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,541
Look, he's talkin' on the phone.
He's talkin' on the phone.

1034
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,413

1035
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,783

but it's goin' down.

1037
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,081
Hell yeah, man,

1038
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,525
I've been goddamn thinkin' about

1039
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,495
Kita, what's goin' on, baby?

00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,499
I'm so happy to see

1041
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,433
Man, I had to goddamn
ride that shit out.

1042
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,993
That fool talkin' about givin'
me five years.

1043
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,437
Somebody had took a warrant out
on me about some robbery shit.

1044
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,873
I already know about
some old shit comin' back,

1045
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,843
but goddamn, didn't know
that shit gonna pop up.

1046
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,970
And then when I went to Grady,
goddamn, them fool like,

1047
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,173
"Yeah, man, you got a warrant."

1048
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,272
I'm like, "What?"

1049
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,805
Had a probation hold
for that old shit.

1050
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,181
- We didn't know
what was goin' on.

1051
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,311
- But I couldn't even
tell nobody.

1052
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,844
- Did you get any of the letters
we sent?

1053
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,219
- Yeah, I got them.

1054
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,247
I got the three letters
you sent, and I got--

1055
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,418
- Got the pictures and stuff?

1056
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,554
- Yeah, hell yeah, man.
I was like, damn, boy.

1057
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,655
Feels so good
to see these streets.

1058
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,166
Like good God Almighty, shit.

1059
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,761
- But you need to, like,
lay low for a couple of days.

1060
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,465
'Cause I really ain't broadcast.
Ain't told nobody nothin'.

1061
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,871
- You ain't told nobody.

1062
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,569
- Naw, fools be comin' up to me,
"Kita, what's going on?"

1063
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,601
- That means they gonna be
totally surprised.

1064
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,169
- That is the most
important part.

1065
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,738
But you got to try
to stay out of trouble.

1066
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,977
- I love y'all.

1067
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,507
I love y'all.

1068
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,917
- I love you, too, Curt,

1069
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,218
and I'm glad to see you
out of jail.

1070
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,689
- How the goddamn heck?

1071
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,158
- I told you, boy.
I'm damn near like a ghost.

1072
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,956
Hey, hey, what's up, Auntie,
baby?

1073
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,463
You're all right.

1074
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,465
Good to see you, boy.

1075
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,466
- Good to see you.

1076
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,467
- I'm all right, man.

1077
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,593
- Oh, shit.

1078
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,865
- Hey, hey, hey,

1079
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,769
- Where the fuck you been?

1080
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,798

1081
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,571

[all speaking at once]

1085
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,253
- Let me call you back.

1086
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,260
- What's up, Pancho, man?

1087
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,125
- Gave the fuck up.

1088
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,562
- They were gonna give you five,
bro.

1089
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,656
- They were talkin'
about reckless

1090
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,792
and everything like that,
don't know what's goin' on.

1091
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,702
- Too many stories out here.
You dead, you--

1092
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,069
all this and that.

1093
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,666
[all speaking at once]

1094
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,573
- Hey, y'all come here.
I want to holler at y'all.

1095
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,043
Boy, I had to win them
goddamn fools.

1096
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,602
I thought it was over for me.

1097
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,912
- Yeah, Curt.

1098
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,281
- Boy, I'm so glad to be here,
boy,

1099
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,183
it's a shame, boy,
they had to bring somebody out

1100
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,482
why it should be
so fucked up now.

1101
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,783
They don't want to be there,
man,

1102
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,620
before they're droppin' me
for four months.

1103
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,523
Yeah, but I tried to get me
a nook.

1104
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,357
I didn't like that, boy.
Had to fight that shit.

1105
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,124
Keep fightin',
but hell yeah, man.

1106
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:09,690
- You know.
You know how we do it.

1107
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,395
- Goddamn.

1108
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,801
Yeah, I need one of them, boy.

1109
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,170
I ain't drunk a beer

1110
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,437
I been missin' black ladies

1111
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,500

1112
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,908
- Why don't you holler at folk,

1113
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,310
Tell 'em you're back out here,

1114
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,211
- Hell yeah, man,

1115
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,843
- Curt just walked up
out of nowhere.

1116
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,046
- What y'all doin',
made me feel--

1117
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,146
I ain't feel this good
in four months.

1118
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,181
I've been dreamin' about y'all,
a beer, and my goddamn camera.

1119
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:39,629
[all speaking at once]

1120
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,460
Hey, hey, what's goin' on, baby?

1121
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,865

00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,630

Hey, D., let me holler at you

- All right.

1125
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,908
- When the last time you seen

1126
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:55,105
[both talking]

1127
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,375
- They say they all been

1128
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,109
- Okay, do White Hat

00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,442
- Okay, can we locate her?
- Yeah, yeah.

1132
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,045

- How close?
- The ho stay right there.

1134
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,849

No problem.

1135
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,259
- We gonna hurt that nigga
way worse

1136
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,262
than he thought he hurt me.

1137
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,763
That's just his family.

1138
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,992
I'm gonna take it straight
to his motherfuckin' family.

1139
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,058
- You got to let your boy do
what he do, you feel me?

1140
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,694
- Let me go.
- First we gonna scope it out.

1141
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,364
And we gonna see what's up.

1142
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,772
I don't give a fuck if it's
children or whoever, real talk,

1143
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,572
but right about now--
my heart gone right now.

1144
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,943
I got a heart, but it's gone.
- You just got out, though.

1145
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,676
You can't get your hands dirty.
You can't get your hands dirty.

1146
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,581
- It might not be today.
It might not be tomorrow.

1147
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,018
But it's gonna happen.
But here's another thing, bro.

1148
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,988
I got to be there myself
to make sure for a fact,

00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,117
Iike they was there to make sure
I was through, finished.

1150
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,922
I got to be there to put
the icing on the cake.

1151
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,691
- You sit in the car,
and I'll bake the cake.

1152
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,322
How about that?

1153
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,389
- We got something for that.

1154
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,559
- 'Cause you know what?

1155
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,034
We're gonna worry
about that later.

1156
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,696
Let's let's go
and get finished partyin'.

1157
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,728

00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,275
- Aw, man.

1162
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,249
- It would have been a foursome.

1163
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,080
- Where the ho Black

1164
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,177

00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,187
- What?

1166
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,347

Anyway, shit.

I'm glad to be out.

1196
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,395
I need to go up and see Adrienne

1197
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,899
She said she gonna be up here,

you know how she be flautin'
the kids like--know what I mean?

1199

We gonna see--be there,"
you know what I mean?

It's like boom,
she know I love her.

1202
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,843
I want to see her
bad as I want to see the baby.

1203
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,368

she know the baby want
to see me,

1205

But Adrienne's so crazy,

1208
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,286
I don't even want
to come back here,

1209
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,652
'cause I know she gonna say,
"Give me something for the baby.

1210
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,022
Give me some money
for something."

1211
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,119
Look to the fact,
you know what I mean?

1212
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,130
But y'all, I'm gonna see what

1231
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,505

and you really aren't
that excited to see me,

1233
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,410
but it's good to see you.

1234
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:58,478
- I am excited to see you.

1235
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,856
Curt, what's your problem?

- Ain't no problem.
I'm just glad to be out of jail.

1237
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:11,328
Glad that I ain't dead.

1238
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,701
- So I hope you're gonna change.

1239
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,706
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

1240
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,139
How can I change

1241
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,302
goddamn the baby need all this?

1242
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,675
- You can do it the right way.

1243
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,579
- Yeah, I am gonna do it
the right way.

1244

Which way is the right way?

1247
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,648
- Not sellin' drugs
and messing around with that.

1248
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,456
- Hmm, that ain't the right way?
- No.

1249
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,019
- What the wrong way?

1250
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,521
- That the wrong way.
- Oh, for real.

You don't say.

1252
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,630
Ain't no right or no wrong way.

There's the need way.

1254
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:55,609
When you need something
or you got to have something,

1255
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,844
then one way you're gonna get it
right then and there.

That the only way I know,
really.

Hell yeah, Pancho, man, shit.

1563
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,982
but my uncles, cousins,

1564
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,818
whole generation
of motherfuckers,

1565
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,221
you know what I mean?

1566
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,386
Been sellin' dope
ever since I was goddamn born,

1567
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,861
way before I was even born,

1568
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,126
Iike 25 years deep
in the dope game,

1569
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,132
you know what I mean?

1570
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,724
First time that ever caught,

1571
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,361
I sold a nigga a nick
for a dime.

1572
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,668
My uncle wasn't there,
and I was at the spot.

1573
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,198
And goddamn I knew where
the dope and all that was.

1574
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,039
I was about 1 2 years old.

1575
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,137
Sold a nigga a set.

1576
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,808
Felt good about the shit.
I was like, "Boy, boom boom."

1577
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:23,751
Yeah, I goddamn--

1578
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,186
I had dope in my system
when I was first born.

1579
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:30,750
I was goddamn--
what you call that shit?

1580
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,158
Premature.

1581
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,629
'Cause my mama, goddamn,
she smoke so goddamn much,

1582
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:37,030
and she had me before I was--

1583
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,466
she used to tell me, be like,
I used to be like this little

1584
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:40,560
when I first got born.

1585
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:41,968
Look, you know what I mean?

1586
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,997
Little enough you can hold me in
the palm of your hand like that.

1587
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,635
Yeah, but she didn't goddamn
never get took by the folk,

1588
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,043
even though she did her thing,
you know what I mean?

1589
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,104
But she wasn't never
no goddamn--

1590
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,480
no geet monster
who ran the street.

1591
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,678
She always made sure children,
everybody was straight.

1592
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,688
And whatever her job was,
she made sure that was done

1593
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,213
before she even did any kind
of dope, you know what I mean?

1594
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,453
But when she do get high,
she just want to goddamn,

1595
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,587
you know what I mean,
enjoy herself.

1596
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:10,690
And I had to get older to peep
that shit, you know what I mean,

1597
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:15,466
be like, "Damn, this what make
Mama happy."

1598
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,564
And I was like, "Damn."

1599
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,939
I ain't feel too fond
of givin' it to her,

1600
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,409
but I rather her get it from--

1601
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,638
I rather for her to get it
from me

1602
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,907
than go out there in the street,

1603
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,039
and somebody sell her some flat
or some shit like that.

1604
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:30,246
Or, you know, some shit like
that what they have in 'em.

1605
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:34,518
Or sell her some bad dope
or something like that.

1606
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,287
Ain't no way in hell, man.

1607
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,658
Yo, man, I can remember myself
bein' that little,

1608
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,823
right there, man,
just like my boy.

1609
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,889
Goddamn, my uncles used to do
the same shit,

1610
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,195
you know what I mean?

1611
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,794
And it'd be damn nearly
the same setup right here.

1612
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,271
He have some liquor.
He had him some weed.

1613
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,967
He had a pistol just sittin'
right there.

1614
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,168
And he'd be sittin' by the door.

1615
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,676
When I just thought
about this shit,

1616
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,202
I was like, damn, damn near in
the same motherfuckin' position.

But this be my uncle,

1619
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,740
That's how I used to be,
just like that,

1620
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,412
while my uncle doin'
this same exact shit.

1621
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,580
I was that little,

1622
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:07,486
runnin' around the house,
back and forth.

1623
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:10,117
Hell yeah.

01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:53,751

1679
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,313
[indistinct conversations]

1680
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,792

No.

1682
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,962

1683
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:05,696
Pop your hand?

1684
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:06,724

1685
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,107

- Just say the word, Curt.

1705
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:11,697
- Don't even worry about it,
boy.

1706
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,599
We're gonna take care
of everything, real talk.

1707
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,469

you know what it is.

Mommy.

1709
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,275
Mommy.

You got to be strong, man.

1715
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,087
Same thing happened to me,
when I was little like you.

1716
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,623
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Got to be strong.

01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,660
[baby crying]

1718
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:05,185
Calm down.
You're not a baby.

1719
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,984
Stop cryin' like a little bitty
old girl, man.

1720
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,481

01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,190

01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,759
Iike you no goddamn baby, man.

You're a big boy.

She gone to a better place.

1729
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,201
Don't worry about that.

1730
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,800
Don't worry about that.

I'm right here.
Pay attention.

1732
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,570
You not say, "Da-Da?"

1733
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:35,345
- [crying]
Mommy.

1734
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:40,822

1739
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,265

01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,435
She said you ain't been eatin'.

1743
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,705
You ain't ate nothin'?

1744
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:05,236
- Man, I have no appetite.

1745
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:10,309
- Curt, you know you can't just,
you know, lay here and mope.

1746
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,876
That was messed up,
what went down,

1747
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,412
but at the same time,
you got to think about the baby.

1748
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:18,587
- I'm gonna need you to keep him
for a little while.

1749
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,152
- On the weekend,
I got children.

1750
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,596
I really can't keep him
right now.

1751
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,623
I can help you with him,
but not right now.

1752
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,033
- I can't be runnin' from

1753
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,042
with that baby.

1754
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,101
I really need y'all to do it.

1755
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,945
- I will help you with him,
but I cannot take him right now.

1756
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,677
There's too much goin' on
with me.

1757
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,344
I can't take him right now.

1758
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:46,013
So you gonna have to get up,
come out of this,

1759
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,488
and see about your baby.

1760
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,759
I'll be back.

1761
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,662

1762
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,223
You gonna be all right, Curt.

1765
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:07,007

01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,908
You know better.

1768
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,913
[rhythmically smacking balloon]

1769

1774
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:59,650
All right, come on, come on.

1775
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:00,787
- Little Curt.

1776
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:04,595
- You swing good?

1777
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,567
But not high.

1778
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,001
- Yeah, you want to go low?

1779
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,868
Hang on, boy.
Grab the thing.

1780
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,339

1781
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,542
- You ready now?
You gonna hold on?

1782
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:24,576
Yo, I'm gonna come back

1783
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,611
Hell yeah, man, shit.

1784
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:29,954
This shit done took a toll.
Boy, they go around.

1785
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,254
I put it on everything.

1786
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,488
I can't believe this shit

1787
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,554
And I don't know what the fuck

1788
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,396
Them folk family,

1789
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,493
Iike goddamn it's my fault

1790
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,505
I-l-l--it my fault somewhat,

1791
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,700
But goddamn--but I ain't know

1792
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,641
Talk about know some shit

1793
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,804
- Yeah, the H.P. move,
that's the move.

1794
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:53,872
I'm talkin' about whole goddamn
definite with it.

1795
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,645
He don't really trust nobody

1796
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,914
so he doin' all the legwork,
you know what I mean?

1797
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,716
He comin' in.
I know his shifts.

1798
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,155
I know what time he come
and what days he come.

1799
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:05,456
And when he come,
goddamn soon as he leave,

1800
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,962
then the money gonna be there,
guaranteed.

1801
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,932
I think we should just try

1802
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,059
when he leave, 'cause
them other nigga green, though.

1803
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,229

1806
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,035
- I say two good niggas.
- Two more good niggas.

1807
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,375
- Two good niggas.

1808
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:25,607
Don't nobody know nobody

1809
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,673
that stayed too lit up
in that motherfucker.

1810
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,241
Yeah, whenever you're ready,

1811
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,548

1812
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,248
when that nigga come
and make his move

1813
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,916
and pick up the dope,
whatever he gonna do.

1814
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,118
Then when he leave, we go
straight in that motherfucker.

1815
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,059
Shit, it's a done deal.

1816
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,959
Baby Curtis.

1817
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,430

Murder my baby mama.

It's going on motherfuckin'

I'm a motherfuckin'
single parent.

1822
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,576
I'm gonna need to have
some money to make him happy.

1823
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,605
I'll be able to buy him whatever

1824
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,139
till the day I die,
you know what I mean?

1825
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:03,879
That's the only way

1826
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:05,887
And the only way I'ma
ever buy him whatever he want,

1827
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,616
I have to have

1828
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,647
Frank, go get the shirt.

1829
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,164

01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,359
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.
