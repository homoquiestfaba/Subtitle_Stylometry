at a community center.

It wasn't one of them.

348
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,657
So, let's get a statement,
and let's get
a description.

349
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,992
That's the first step.

350
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,744
I am guessing that
you don't remember

351
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,662
the last time we
met each other.

352
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,457
A year ago
in the same cellar.

353
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,296
Wait a minute.

354
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,217
You think this
has something to do
with your dad?

355
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,141
Look, she just moved in,

356
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,893
she's a little jumpy
and this freakin' kid

357
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,645
is downstairs
when she gets home.

358
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,271
We're on top of it,
Mr. Tanner.

359

BARRETT: Let's take care
of this fast.

360
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,691
Do you want
his fingerprints?

361
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,659
He switched them again.

362

MARY ON PHONE:
I wasn't exactly snooping.
I was cleaning and I saw it.

364
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,548
Uh-huh. But there
are no accidents,
are there, Mary?

365
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,092
And your son put
something in that letter

366
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,719
about himself
that he was not ready
for you to know.

367
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,181
But I feel I have
a right to make sure
he stays safe,

368
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,767
that he stays happy.

369
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,769
And that he makes
the kind of choices

370
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,813
that are the right
choices for him to do that.

371
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,402
Am I a bad mother for
thinking we should be
able to talk about

372
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,195
anything and everything?

373
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,365
The paperboy for your area
is a boy named Derek.

374
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,367
No, he said
his name was Cam.

375
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,119
Well, it's Derek.

376
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,289
And he fit your description.
This is the kid, trust me.

377
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,291
He's got the eyes
you were talking about.

378
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,043
His parents said
he has something
called aniridia.

379
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,795
It's when the iris
doesn't develop,

380
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,589
so it stays
black like the pupil.

381
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,216
Well, did you go to his house
and question him?

382
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,801
Yeah, and the kid
was more than
a little surprised

383
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,344
to see us
at 2:00 in the morning,

384
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,638
that includes his parents
who gave sworn statements

385
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,266
that Derek was home
all night, did homework,

386
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,518
watched some TV
and was in bed by 11 :30.

387
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,854
Yeah, well,
parents lie for their kids
all the time.

388
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,898
I said he had an alibi,
I didn't say we believed it.

389
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,817
I just want to
know what the hell
he was doing in my house.

390
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,611
Doesn't it make
you stop and think?

391
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,779
It made all of
us stop and think,

392
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,741
but we have nothing to tie him
to your dad whatsoever.

393
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,367
What about fingerprints?

394
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,869
We didn't find any.

395

As a matter of fact,
we couldn't find
anyone in that cul-de-sac

about this kid at all.

It barked and chased
the boy every time
he came to deliver the paper.

your father found that dog

went after him.

They'd been
called out to the house
themselves a few times...

421

And they always
found him drunk,
so no one believed him.

00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:35,748
you reach out
into the shadows.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Sonny,

515
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,459
I know you're trying
to help people, but

516
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,337
do you ever stop
and think about
what else might be out there?

517
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,924
Out there
listening to you?

518
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,342
So this is my fault now?

519
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,928
No, I'm saying
you're all over the place
out there.

520
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,390
A bus can't go by in the city
without your face
plastered on it.

521
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,683
Keep it down.

522
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:55,893
Look, Sonny,

523
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,688
he wages a war
against your dad.
He listens to your show.

524
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,940
He reads in
the same paper
he delivers

525
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,151
every morning that
you're moving right here.

526
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,995
You know, sometimes
after they dig the big hole,

527
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,374
they put in lights,
tiles and water in it.

528
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,378
Sounds to me
like this kid needs
a good kick in the ass.

529
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,299
You know,
your paperboy from hell.

530
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,681
Hey, you remember
that guy you were seeing,

531
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,725
the first year
we were dormies?

532
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,269
The Delta guy who
lived across campus

533
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,648
with the dimples,
and the smile and
the bubble butt?

534
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,526
The guy you were
so wrapped up in

535
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,694
till he stomped
all over your heart?

536
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,155
Yeah, what about him?

537
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,076
Wasn't he a frat boy
with a law degree too?

538
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,497
I'm just saying...

539
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,584
I'm just saying that

540
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,214
you should have someone
who really loves you

541
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,091
and

542
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,469
wants to take care of you.

543
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,015
Paula.

544
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,772
How many of
those have you had?

545
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,233
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

546
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,359
I didn't mean it
like that.

547
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,403
You know,
if you want me to shut up,
I'll shut up...

548
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,863
(SCREAMING)

549
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,034
Help me!

550
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,372
Help me! Oh, my God!

551
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,624
Help me!
My head's killing me.

552
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,668
It's not funny.

553
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,088
It was just a joke.
What, I thought
this was a party!

554
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,510
What?

555
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,847
Don't tell me.

556
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:01,435
Hey!

557
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,105
Do you see him,
Barrett?
Where'd he go?

558
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,191
Son of a...

559
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,318
You peeping on us,
you sick, little animal?

560
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,569
SONNY: Barrett...

561
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,862
Huh? Where is he?

562
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:13,864
Sick, little bastard!

563
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,115
Stay calm.

564
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,283
Barrett.

565
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,368
Here he is.
He's a kid.

566
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,453
BARRETT: I got him.

567
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,079
Now, you're the one
who's peeping.

568
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,748
BARRETT: I don't believe this.
Look at this!

569
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,082
DARREN: Give him
a thumping, Bar!

570
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,918
BARRETT: He's right there.
He's right there.
SONNY: Stay calm!

571
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,670
He's right here!
He's right in front of me.

572
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,797
He's standing right,
goddamn, there.

573
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,257
(CRIES OUT)

574
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,469
Bar! Bar! Holy...

575
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,638
Come here, Bar!
Give me your hand!

576
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,516
Attaboy, attaboy!
Give me your hand.
Attaboy, attaboy.

577
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:45,771
Grab on, grab on.
Help him out, guys.
All right, got it?

578
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,855
You okay?
You okay, bro?

579
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,898
You all right?

580
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,900
Just breathe,
just breathe.

581
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,071
Son of a bitch.
It's piss!

582
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,155
What?
What?

583
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,659
This kid's not sick,
he's dead!

584
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,122
Maybe he is an animal.

585
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,668
Isn't that how they
mark their territory?

586
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,892
SONNY:
No one laughed, Barrett.

587
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,436
I distinctly heard
lesbians giggling.

588
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,357
You wanna fight
fire with fire,
just let me slap

589
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,609
a civil suit on
that punk's family.

590
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,821
I'll end his
little reign of terror
the old-fashioned way.

591
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,074
If that kid is half of
what you think he is,

592
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,618
you got a hell of
a lawsuit working here.

593
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,288
What's the crossbow
doing in the garage?

594
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,789
What,
I can't keep it out here?

595
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,542
No, I don't want it here.
Take it with you when you go.

596
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,877
You sure you don't
want it for protection?

597
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,714
Thanks. I'll stick to
my dad's baseball bat.

598
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,467
Tell me something,
what happened today

599
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,720
when you fell
into the pool pit?

600
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,101
Was I imagining?

601
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,686
You don't want
to get into this.

602
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,188
No, you don't want
to get into this.

603
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:14,151
I had a hell of
a trick played on me
when I was a kid.

604
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,864
My cousin and his buddies.

605
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,949
When I was little.

606
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:26,079
One day, they dug a grave,
and they put me in it

607
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,541
in a cardboard box.

608
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,962
It had a hole
with a long snorkel

609
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,797
so I could breathe
while I was being buried.

610
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,345
The idea was,
I'd be buried alive
for an hour,

611
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,846
then they pull
out the snorkel.

612
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,058
And the test was
to see if I could

613
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,601
hold my breath
while they dug me out.

614
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,228
That's awful.

615
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,313
No, no.

616
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,232
No, let me tell you
what's awful.

617
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,611
What's awful is chanting.

618
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:01,281
"Little Barrett Tanner,
they put him in the ground.

619
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:06,787
"And when they did,
he didn't know
he never would be found.

620
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,041
"They buried him
living and screaming and then

621
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,711
"they never dug him up
again."

622
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,132
They chanted that,

623
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,261
throwing dirt
over me in the hole.

624
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,100
So, I lay there
for an hour, crying.

625
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,313
The box caved in all
around me from the dirt.

626
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,067
I'm sucking on the snorkel,

627
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,153
afraid it would be
ripped away at any second

628
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:44,574
and I'd have to hold
my breath or suffocate.

629
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,327
What happened?

630
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,621
A neighbor found me,
dug me out.

631
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,834
I don't like small places,

632
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,628
and I especially
don't like them

633
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,422
when they're
holes in the ground.

634
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,344
Hey, come on.
I was, like, 10 years old
when that happened. Relax.

635
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,639
Yeah, well, it seemed
pretty recent today.

636
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,225
(CLATTERING)

637
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,356
Don't tell me.

638
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,778
If that sick bastard
is down in the basement
listening to us,

639
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,238
I will personally
wring his neck.

640
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,865
No, it's the cat.

Go back in the bedroom.

What are you gonna do?

646
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,921
I'll be goddamned!

647
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,840
Just call the cops!

00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,508
I am the goddamn cops!

649
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,886
I am gonna
rip his head off.

650
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,430
If he's down there,
I'm gonna break him in half!

I'm gonna call the cops.

00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,633

00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,291
Have you arrested him?

669
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,792
This is frustrating
for us, too.

670

Have you taken
him into custody?

No, we did not.

672
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,008
Let me guess, his parents
said he was home
with them all night.

673
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,469
Detectives,
when you were a kid,
did you ever sneak out?

674
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,472
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I did. A few times.

675
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,100
Even Barrett said
someone he didn't see

676
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,810
came out of
the dark and pushed him.

677
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,397
No, I saw him.
I talked to him.

678
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,858
No, you talked to
a shadow at the top

679
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,319
of the stairs.
You said so yourself.

680
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,905
No, I said
he was in shadow.

681
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,033
All right, fine.
You take that to court,

682
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,243
and his parents
get on the stand,

683
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:18,371
and they say that
he's been home all night.
That's reasonable doubt.

684
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,456
No...

685
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,540
You ask your boyfriend

is not strong enough
for you, Detectives.

autograph something

breaks into my house

689

aren't his birth parents.

They adopted him
when he was five years old.

whoever she is,

down in the cellar.

716
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,567

right back there
in that basement,

and telling myself
that he wasn't something evil.

Well,

back in the basement.

at the bottom of

He drank.

729
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:07,415
He drank and fell
down the basement steps.

730
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,126
The autopsy confirmed
his alcohol level.

731
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,213
I heard what he said
after he pushed you.

732
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:16,883
He's got some twisted
nursery rhyme thing going,

733
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,177

from that show you did.
