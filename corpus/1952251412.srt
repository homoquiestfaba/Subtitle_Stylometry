1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,626
- Yes.
- I’ll pick you up later.

2
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,252
Dear Mr. Norvo,

3
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:39,503
Regarding gaining access to your
properties in the Lower Quarter

4
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,544
during our expansion
of Southern Comm Cable

5
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,169
taxes on proposed payment...

6
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,127
Blah, blah, blah

7
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:32,087
Who among us can withstand
the wild pain of love’s demand?

8
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,962
It brings to us its blunt decree.
Leave deceit or leave with me.

9
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:40,755
And we who listen,
what do we say?

10
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:44,046
Do we say yes or run away?

11
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,755
I cut myself.

12
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:55,088
Blood of the fox for the hunt.

13
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,589
Tatta awake yet?

14
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,089
I don’t know.

15
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,464
Everything’s backward.

16
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,714
I was away from her as a child
and now I’m with her as an adult.

17
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:27,214
You know, she talks like
she’d brought you up.

18
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,005
Didn’t you miss her when
you were away at school.

19
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,422
She had my best interests
at heart.

20
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,130
I was a good boy,

21
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,297
Till I meet you.

22
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:48,006
I don’t have time for this.

23
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,465
See you after the beating
of the bachelor drums.

24
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,423
Don’t try to leave town,
Mrs. Martin.

25
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:02,507
We’re watching you.

26
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:46,508
Hey, baby, whatcha know?

27
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,133
Not much.

28
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:49,966
No? Stay outta trouble now.

29
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,509
Just like you.

30
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:54,509
Yeah, baby, just like me.

31
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:58,175
Remember, nothing’s as good as they
say it is! Nothing! Not even me!

32
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,092
Although I can do something awful
pretty good.

33
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,925
Tell me what you want for this.

34
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,550
Grab the balls!
Grab the balls!

35
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:22,802
Grab the balls!
Grab the balls!

36
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,343
Now, he’s just being virtuous.

37
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,259
In a couple of years he’s
gonna be begging for it.

38
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,926
I am getting married in France.

39
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,468
What the fuck does that mean?
I got married in Cleveland.

40
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,468
I’m telling you guys,
and understand this.

41
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,468
What happens is I just love
Carol Lisa.

42
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:42,551
This man is obviously very confused
about love,

43
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:45,635
the state of holy matrimony
and the purpose of this party.

44
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,967
Hey, Manny don’t forget
you’re a vegetarian now.

45
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:56,968
<i>Hey, Johnny!</i>

46
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:03,968
Johnny, how you doin’? Thanks
for comin’, man, thank you.

47
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:14,219
I don’t believe it.
Johnny Collins.

48
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:17,511
Thierry?

49
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,094
You got the power tie.

50
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:21,886
Asshole.

51
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,968
I hear you’re married and teach
at UNO, tell me it isn’t true.

52
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,219
Well, I was teaching
and I am married.

53
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:29,887
<i> Good morning lady </i>

54
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:48,220
The boy always had sweet teeth.

55
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,095
This is first-class accomodations

56
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,303
- This one’s mine.
- No, no.

57
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:12,304
- Nothing about you changed?
- Oh, yes!

58
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,137
- I’m not gonna do anything to you.
- A little of decore.

59
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,054
All right.

60
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:22,096
- She still has her hearing.
- All right, okay?

61
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,012
Tatta?

62
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,221
I’m here!

63
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:34,012
Go hide.
Go hide.

64
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:36,847
Tatta.

65
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,639
You’ll never guess who’s employed
at the mighty Southern Comm

66
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,555
under me.

67
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,888
It’s nice to see you so happy.

68
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,472
So, you’re his wife, are you?

69
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:55,430
Yes.

70
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,639
Who are you?

71
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:00,555
I’m Johnny Collins.

72
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:03,222
One hint.

73
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:06,222
We grew up in Baton Rouge
together, same street, same age.

74
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:10,931
I’m an old friend.

75
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:12,056
Thank you.

76
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,765
Okay, Mrs. Martin.

77
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:21,890
Okay, what?

78
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,431
Just okay.

79
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,181
Now we know who the other is.

80
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,723
You know, you have a very
peculiar notion about introductions.

81
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,599
- Johnny Collins?
- Johnny?

82
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,682
John Paul Gregory Collins.
the Third.

83
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,808
- I was afraid it was you.
- Tatta.

84
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,849
Under my very nose
for the last year,

85
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:55,890
only now does he make
his presence known.

86
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:01,808
That’s Thierry’s great grandfather.

87
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:09,516
His eloquence was God’s
and it flowed through him like

88
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,182
divine lighting.

89
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,973
Impressive looking man.

90
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,683
Do they still have a poet laureate?

91
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:20,933
Archaic, isn’t.

92
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,475
Actually the state is looking
for someone right now.

93
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,308
I deeply appreciate your confidence
in me,

94
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:32,016
but my balladeer days, alas,
are over.

95
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:34,016
My pen belongs to Southern Comm.

96
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,058
Well, I’m going to let the three
of you put the moon into bed.

97
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:42,974
Tatta.

98
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,767
- Good night.
- Good night.

99
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:57,101
So, how’s your dad?

100
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,810
My father passed.

101
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,059
He had a heart attack
about a year ago.

102
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:04,975
I’m sorry.

103
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,851
Yeah.

104
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:12,101
Thierry and I were misfits together.

105
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:13,893
Artists in exile

106
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,726
Did you ever graduate?

107
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:21,017
He never even attended.

108
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,477
He faked the whole thing,
took the tuition money,

109
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:27,143
rented a studio, bought canvases
and painted.

110
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,185
Only old big daddy found out,
didn’t he?

111
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:32,811
Yeah, the judge was not amused.

112
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,060
He cut me off until I came
to my senses.

113
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:42,560
But if I can’t paint,
everything just turns to shit.

114
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,727
- What if you don’t sell?
- I can’t worry about that, man.

115
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:55,852
That’s denying what I call
the artist’s life.

116
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,936
I think money’s an excuse
for a lack of art, anyway.

117
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:03,728
I don’t care who you are,
Donald Trump, who the hell,

118
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:04,520
without...

119
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:06,228
creativity

120
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,436
without...
life,

121
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:15,728
and you are truly unable to go
straight up the devil’s ass.

122
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,436
Lookin’ right in the face,

123
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,812
smile

124
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:22,853
and survive.

125
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:25,395
Passion.

126
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:29,311
Hey, Thier, I make no excuses
for what I do.

127
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:31,396
Yeah.

128
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,187
You have your models.

129
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,062
Do you have that?
Always have that.

130
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:40,145
Weel, that’s quite the situation

131
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,896
to have women come over
and take their clothes off for you.

132
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:46,145
Yes, it is, when that big red snatcer’s
comin’ right up against your face,

133
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:49,020
like a freight train it’s pretty hard
to paint and I’ll tell you what.

134
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,479
You always felt you had to tell them
the story of your life to fuck ’em.

135
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:57,104
It was a very short story.

136
00:13:58,562 --> 00:13:59,562
But as a recall,

137
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:02,104
it was always my talkin’ that
got the girls to the barn.

138
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,355
I think I’d like to paint your portrait,
Thier.

139
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,188
Sure.

140
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,688
Put me behind my daddy’s desk
at Southern Comm

141
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,230
like some great father of industry?

142
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,063
No way, man.

143
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:18,647
No.

144
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,897
I’ll to it right here.

145
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,021
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

146
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:29,897
All right.

147
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:31,896
Why not?

148
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:35,979
What do you think?

149
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:38,731
Fine by me.

150
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,272
Great.

151
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,314
Well, I better be goin’.

152
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,815
I gotta get up early in the a.m
and toil the line

153
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,356
now that I know who’s the boss.

154
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:51,815
Lovely.

155
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,356
<i> I really am sorry about your dad</i>

156
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,023
If it’s Southern Comm,

157
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:18,690
you don’t have to stay here.

158
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:23,774
Yes, I do.

159
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:28,440
Thierry, you can’t just shut out
what you are.

160
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:33,774
You can’t just decide to be your father
like that and become him.

161
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,857
I’m not trying to be him.

162
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,440
I’m just trying to get the company
back for him.

163
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,316
Goin’ after the balls first, too,
like Johnny.

164
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,233
He’s great one for spirit.

165
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,274
He troubled you, didn’t he?

166
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,024
You’ll get to liking him.

167
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:11,899
He grows on you.

168
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,108
So do worts.

169
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,942
<i> What is the Lord?</i>

170
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:34,067
<i> Where is He hiding and why
can’t I see Him inside?</i>

171
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:38,359
So I ask you: Are you tired
of searching for God?

172
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:42,442
Well, he’s not wearing Levi 501’s.

173
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:58,901
I love it.

174
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,568
I love it, Zandalee,
it’s adorable.

175
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:04,819
Where’d you find this, honey?

176
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,110
Now, if I go and find somebody
to take me.

177
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:13,735
I’m gonna get some looks
at the Sweetheart’s Ball.

178
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,485
Are you and Thierry goin’?

179
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,902
- Mind fuckin’?
- I’m sorry, I’, sorry.

180
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:27,277
Girl, you are getting’ seriously
lethargic, even for New Orleans.

181
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,611
I think it’s about time you get a little
pinch and bustle inside your bodice.

182
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,361
- Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:35,611
Well. I’m, gettin’ it, don’t worry.

184
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,528
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

185
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,403
Here it is, I’ve saved it for you.

186
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:42,361
And nobody else has seen it.

187
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,820
I think these colours could be
perfect for you.

188
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:49,403
What do you think?

189
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,319
Look at these buttons,
they’re like Persian cat eyes.

190
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,903
Take your time, honey,
make a meal out of it.

191
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:57,277
Come back to the dressing room.

192
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,236
Are you wearin’ that
to the Sweetheart’s Ball?

193
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:01,112
And don’t you be tellin’ everybody.

194
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,028
Back in the back.

195
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,278
Come here, you.

196
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:10,862
If you’ gettin’ it,
it’s not enough.

197
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,903
Would you stop worrying about me?

198
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:15,570
But I do worry about you.
I mean, girl,

199
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,779
if you look like you’re about to come
out of some jacket with pearl buttons.

200
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:21,362
I don’t know about you
but I think it’s time for you

201
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:24,028
to take a serious excursion
with me sometime real soon.

202
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:29,404
I’m gonna be the belle
of my sweetheart’s balls.

203
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,903
- You’re disgusting.
- And you love me for it.

204
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,488
Forget it, I am your reality check.

205
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,780
Johnny, do you want me
to shut the fun off?

206
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:53,405
No, I like it.

207
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,321
I like predictable tensions.

208
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,905
It’s buggin’ me, all right,
I can’t think.

209
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:09,947
Can you just try to stay seated?

210
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,781
It’s ironic you ending up with me
as your boss.

211
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:23,905
What are you planning on doing
with all the poetry, boss?

212
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:29,322
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean in that way.

213
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:35,322
I mean, nothing’s the way I thought
it would be.

214
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:40,824
The girls.

215
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,240
Make groceries, huh?

216
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:51,906
I love it.

217
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:53,865
Is he doing me justice?

218
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:58,031
You were always talented.

219
00:19:58,657 --> 00:19:59,865
Eat a cookie.

220
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:02,532
Be kind.

221
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:03,698
Zan, come on in here.

222
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:06,365
I’m gonna fix chicken.

223
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,156
Espanian, like in the old days.

224
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:09,906
Ole.

225
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:17,990
Do you like it?

226
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:21,741
It’s to soon to tell.

227
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,949
Don’t mind her, she never critiques
till you’re finished.

228
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:29,074
Pain in the ass.

229
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,783
Your arms are around me
but your so far way.

230
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:47,950
Sorry.

231
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,700
I haven’t seen this for awhile.

232
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:05,742
The awkward sentiments
of a protracted adolescence.

233
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,450
You were good.

234
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:11,117
Shit.

235
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:14,492
Come on, your standards
are so high, they’re cruel.

236
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:17,617
No, they’re not.

237
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:19,700
It’s too easy.

238
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,326
Since when did the Martin legacy
become so important to you?

239
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:25,118
January twelfth of last year.

240
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,159
Your father’s dying isn’t the issue
anyway.

241
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,910
You just made it one
to quit writing.

242
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:37,076
Oh, is that so?

243
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,243
Do you remember when
we used to live on St. Charles

244
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,910
and you’d come home from classes,
Professor Martin?

245
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,285
I’d close the shop and we’d make
love all afternoon?

246
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,661
Lost a lot of business.

247
00:21:57,536 --> 00:22:00,285
- We were happy.
- Do you think I’ve just quit?

248
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:02,744
I didn’t just quit.

249
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,077
What do you want me to do
with him?

250
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,202
Sit on the porch by the river
and try to write.

251
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:50,912
I think we have a problem?

252
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,662
Norvo agreed to everything.

253
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,453
Well, there quite a dollar
discrepancy

254
00:22:58,453 --> 00:22:59,829
in the figures to be paid out.

255
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:01,495
There aren’t any discrepancies.

256
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:08,371
Well, the figure we agreed upon was
four thousand nine hundred dollars.

257
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,704
There are never discrepancies.

258
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:16,579
Richard Norvo was a slum lord.

259
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,079
Richard Norvo is an owner
of property

260
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:22,663
and a friend of Councilman Lweis.

261
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,287
Shit, man.

262
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:30,954
We’re talking about fifty
thousand dollars here.

263
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,538
Go with the decimal, Thierry.

264
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,539
At twenty-five my father started
a radio station.

265
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,539
At thirty he was a millionaire
owing his own radio network

266
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,288
with his morality intact.

267
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:43,789
Your father didn’t keep up
with the times.

268
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,996
We’ve been bought out, Thierry.

269
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,497
Now, it’s up to you to be
diplomatic

270
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,330
if you wanna preserve what’s left
of your father’s company.

271
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:57,664
I’ll set a lunch for you
with Norvo tomorrow.

272
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:06,455
Shake it up!
It ain’t much of a hold!

273
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:08,414
An undelayed miracle of movement!

274
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,790
<i> Here you go, ladies, two more
Puss ‘n’ Boots.</i>

275
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:20,623
Thank you, Buckles.

276
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:32,706
This one’s my personal favorite.

277
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,706
Guess were I was this morning.

278
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,039
In the chapel.

279
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:44,998
Well, say two Hail Mary’s, honey,
call me in the morning.

280
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:49,083
Girl, you better check his donor
card if you’re gonna do that.

281
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,042
Wonderful feet.

282
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,293
I didn’t mean to wake you.

283
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,960
Somebody has a good time.

284
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:38,293
Certainly did.

285
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,710
Some strange and wonderful secrets
on Bourbon Street this evening.

286
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,252
- Bourbon Street?
- Yes, Bourbon Street.

287
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:46,710
God.

288
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:54,877
- You would have figured.
- Not me.

289
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:57,670
Can you help me, please,
I’m...

290
00:26:58,461 --> 00:26:59,420
Help me.

291
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,837
I want you like we used to want.

292
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:20,044
Tell me, tell me to say your name.

293
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:23,086
Say it, Zandalee, say it.

294
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:27,586
Harder, harder.
Don’t you want me?

295
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:29,919
Say it.
Say my name.

296
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:31,921
Thierry.

297
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,087
Thierry.

298
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:35,754
Thierry.

299
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:43,671
Go on!

300
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:45,504
Do it!

301
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,087
Jesus!

302
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:52,796
All right.

303
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,295
All right, I just thought we’d try it,
that’s all.

304
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:58,129
You know, be explorers.

305
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:08,880
You have to make a place for us
in your life.

306
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:11,046
Please.

307
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:12,755
I want to.

308
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:24,797
- Is it me? ‘Cause I want you to tell me.
- God, it was nothing to do with you.

309
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,797
I’m just paralyzed

310
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,422
A paraplegic of the soul.

311
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,381
There you go, a metaphor
for old times’ sake.

312
00:29:15,006 --> 00:29:17,757
Zandalee, please, I can’t deal
with this.

313
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,173
Do you know what?

314
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:27,132
I wish you were a paraplegic because
at least I could understand then.

315
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:36,965
What?

316
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:41,757
A lizard.

317
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:52,883
Come here.

318
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,427
Hey, babe, I sell it to you for five
bucks, a bit, twenty-five cents.

319
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:18,343
It’s a deal.

320
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,844
It’s a steal.

321
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:23,468
Okay, you got me.
All right, all right.

322
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,009
That’s pretty funny.

323
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,219
<i> I gave in</i?</i>

324
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,511
You think so?

325
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:31,094
He got caught.

326
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:33,594
Don’t wanna be caught,
Shouldn’t be a thief.

327
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:35,719
<i> I got it from my mother,
I swear to that.</i>

328
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:37,969
What’s that?

329
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:42,219
<i> You can stake my life on that man,
all right?</i>

330
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,010
The black rose of fate.

331
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,553
I got a broken heart, man,
I need an operation.

332
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:49,219
Want one?

333
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:57,927
Zandalee.

334
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:01,720
We’re gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

335
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:03,053
So?

336
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,512
<i> That’s all enough?</i>

337
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,178
Whatta you think?
Any good?

338
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:16,554
I take it’s quit a bold
interpretation.

339
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,595
It’s an understatement.

340
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:30,137
I think it’s impossible to record
anything today as a fact

341
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,387
without causing some injury
to the image.

342
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:39,721
I’ll try it in the bedroom.

343
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:49,513
I’ll have some champagne.

344
00:32:57,638 --> 00:32:58,638
What do you think?

345
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:03,763
No doubts that isn’t
your talents.

346
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,849
I remember the last time I saw
your father, God rests his soul.

347
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,348
Heard you were lookin’
for an apartment in the Quarter.

348
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:48,181
I offered him a gorgeous one,
it was on Royal Street, third floor.

349
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:51,265
The last tenants had completely
renovated it.

350
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,223
I preferred to find my own apartment.

351
00:33:57,432 --> 00:33:58,348
Thank you.

352
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:01,432
Well.

353
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,056
If you’re ever...looking,

354
00:34:06,223 --> 00:34:08,181
come see me, I’ll cut you
a good deal.

355
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,765
Thank you, but we’re quite
happy were we are.

356
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:14,057
I share your sensibilities,

357
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,683
but you’re on the move now,
Vice President Martin.

358
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:21,224
Time you come over to the house,
have dinner, meet the family.

359
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:28,099
Better yet, come spend the weekend
at the camp in Mississippi.

360
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,433
You a huntin’ man?

361
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:48,350
Where you at, darlin’?
You got somethin’ for me?

362
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:55,642
I thank you.

363
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:08,100
Spare a quarter for an old
altar boy, baby.

364
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:09,142
No.

365
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,058
No?

366
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,767
Get away.

367
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:16,642
Why?

368
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,350
Do I have to spell this out for you?

369
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:21,601
No

370
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:23,601
The go lay off on someone else.

371
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:24,893
I’m not like that.

372
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:28,643
And you shouldn’t cast aspersions
on people you don’t know.

373
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,726
We’re inevitable.

374
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:38,934
I wanna shake you naked
and eat you alive, Zandalee.

375
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,601
Don’t say my name.

376
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,768
Johnny.

377
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:56,977
Nobody will be heart from it

378
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,394
because It is what it is.

379
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,144
It is what it is.

380
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:05,769
Just as simple as that.

381
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:07,811
You want it

382
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,519
and I wanna give it.

383
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:13,227
Perfectly relationship.

384
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:19,352
That’s not a relationship.

385
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,602
Zandalee.

386
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:25,727
Zandalee.

387
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:31,687
Do you know what I like?

388
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,603
I like it when you don’t wear
anything under.

389
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:10,648
What are you thinking?

390
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,731
You’re an insecure sad woman.

391
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:18,440
I am not.

392
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:25,356
It’s pretty hard to hide
the clairvoyance of the eyes.

393
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:01,940
He’s not a bad man.

394
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,400
<i>Hey, it’s Pepe.</i>

395
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,483
<i>You meet me tomorrow at the Five
Deuces six o’clock.</i>

396
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:37,525
<i>Don’t be late, bring cash and
I’ll have what you want.</i>

397
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:56,942
I can see you’ve been
staying up nights.

398
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:00,234
I understand.

399
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,651
I have needs, too.

400
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:09,526
Although...

401
00:40:11,818 --> 00:40:14,067
though my husband has been gone

402
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:16,151
for many years.

403
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:18,860
And?

404
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:20,943
Well?

405
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:24,110
there has been someone and...

406
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:26,735
then there is someone.

407
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,110
Really?

408
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,527
And, he’s now moved to New Orleans
you know, to be with me.

409
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:38,026
In fact, we’ve always lived
close to one another.

410
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:46,152
I would love it, if he would
come here,

411
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,985
but it’s, you know, difficult.

412
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:52,193
I think maybe we better
have your friend over for dinner.

413
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,403
Father, pick a card.

414
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:04,653
Okay.
Right.

415
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:19,236
Is that your card?

416
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:21,278
Yeah.

417
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,653
Man, how’d you do that?

418
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:25,486
That’s my secret.

419
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,027
I need another shoot.

420
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:34,529
Why is it that the Baptists get
the woman but no booze

421
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:36,696
and the Catholics get the booze
and no women?

422
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:42,237
You know, Pepe was lookin’ for you
a while ago

423
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:44,028
and he left a little something’ for you.

424
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:51,654
He said you short poured him
a bunch o’ C notes on the last round.

425
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:53,446
There’s not a worry in the world.

426
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:55,654
You’re just gonna have to float me
on the bar tab.

427
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,654
Unless the good Lord
takes care of me.

428
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:01,446
Johnny, Johnny.

429
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:04,613
This is about the only economy
left in the town.

430
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:07,530
Maybe it’s the only one
you allow yourself to see.

431
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:11,905
Father, you don’t really need
your parish down here.

432
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:18,655
I’ve been lookin’ for you.

433
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:20,946
Seems like everybody’s
lookin’ for me today.

434
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:23,572
- And what’ll you have?
- I’ll have what he has.

435
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:26,572
So, whatta you wanna see
me about?

436
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,946
Don’t look so concerned.

437
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,113
I’m not, I just get nervous when,
people say they’re lookin’ for me.

438
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:33,697
Well, rest easy,

439
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:36,530
the only paper I’m servin’
is an invitation to dine.

440
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,239
I have plans.

441
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:43,489
Bring her along.

442
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:46,573
Look, just come, I need you there.

443
00:42:48,156 --> 00:42:50,114
We’re meeting Tatta’s
secret boyfriend.

444
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,489
Really?

445
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,989
Really.

446
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:57,698
For all of ‘em.

447
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:00,906
Thanks, boss.

448
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:08,531
This duck is really succulent.

449
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:13,740
Why a duck? Why not
a turkey or a chicken?

450
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,866
The Marx Brothers, didn’t you get it?

451
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:21,949
Yeah, I got it.

452
00:43:22,907 --> 00:43:23,740
Yeah.

453
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:26,907
Were you named after
the cognac, Remy?

454
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:29,740
Not Remy, Ray-me.

455
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:33,323
Ah, Ray-me!

456
00:43:34,407 --> 00:43:35,365
Thierry.

457
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:40,699
I’m really didn’t wanna have to bring
this up, it’s such a lovely dinner,

458
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:41,949
but,

459
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,491
I think I have to tell you

460
00:43:46,783 --> 00:43:48,950
that you married the wrong girl,
Thierry.

461
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,700
How, so?

462
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,575
Because if you’d married Remy,

463
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,700
the she’d be Remy Martin.

464
00:43:58,575 --> 00:43:59,741
That’s reallly cute.

465
00:44:01,616 --> 00:44:02,700
I thought so.

466
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,700
To Tatta and Louie.

467
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:13,032
Eternal happiness in life’s
great mistery.

468
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:15,408
Thank you.

469
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:25,951
Mr. Medina,

470
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:29,826
are you intending to make
Tatta honorable?

471
00:44:32,075 --> 00:44:34,200
But it is not the ring that gives
soul to honor,

472
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:36,200
it is heart.

473
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:38,784
An unswerving heart.

474
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:43,451
It maybe just a touch, maybe
just a touch of sin

475
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,659
that will give us this “joie de vivre”.

476
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,617
My dear grandmamma,

477
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:52,743
go and do as the natives do.

478
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,285
Be careful what you say,

479
00:44:55,535 --> 00:44:58,743
you just might give people here
a license to rise sensuousness.

480
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:00,285
Right in that ear right there.

481
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:03,951
I’ll go prepare the dessert.

482
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:13,285
Back in the old New Orleans’
red light district,

483
00:45:14,118 --> 00:45:17,285
Countess Willie Piazza, madame
of a ritzi “maison de plasir”,

484
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,952
was famous for an exotic dessert.

485
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:24,201
Cherries jubilee?

486
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:25,870
Do tell, Tatta.

487
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,619
No!

488
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,327
Imagine fresh cherries boiled
in cream

489
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:35,453
sweetened with absinthe.

490
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:40,411
Served stuffed inside the privates
of the ruling quadroon beauty.

491
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:43,744
Is that what Zan’s up to?

492
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,327
I didn’t teach you that.

493
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,828
You don’t remember.

494
00:45:52,494 --> 00:45:54,161
I know you want dessert,
Zandalee.

495
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:59,454
Don’t bring your girl friends
into my house.

496
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:11,370
I’m not some dumb coon-ass
you can mess with.

497
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:12,620
Understand?

498
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:13,953
Fine.

499
00:46:15,454 --> 00:46:16,912
You be whatever you wanna be,

500
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:20,953
but I know what you really are.

501
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,537
And what is that?

502
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:26,704
Nothing but a dumb coon-ass prick.

503
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:32,163
<i>Really?</i>

504
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:33,079
Then take me.

505
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:37,663
Take my dumb coon-ass prick
inside of you

506
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,121
with your husband in the next room.

507
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,455
Can you do that?

508
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:45,371
Yes.

509
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:54,079
<i>Hey, Johnny, come save me from
the horrible stories they’re telling.</i>

510
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:55,413
I’ll be there in a minute.

511
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:57,329
<i>Just washing up.</i>

512
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:22,539
<i>And he kills bums, people
that nobody cares about.</i>

513
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:24,372
<i>That’s horrible.</i>

514
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:28,456
<i>Some people escape God’s eye.</i>

515
00:47:29,038 --> 00:47:31,789
<i>Conscience is the sole arbiter
of the individual</i>

516
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,955
<i>Without it...</i>

517
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,373
What’ve you done to your hair?

518
00:47:57,415 --> 00:47:58,540
I’m just experimenting.

519
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:01,790
It’s unsettling.

520
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:06,957
It doesn’t become you.

521
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,708
So, where is Louie?

522
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,958
He likes to linger in the morning.

523
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:41,749
I’ve recognized him.

524
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:45,708
He was always on the periphery.

525
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,292
Holidays, straight week-ends,

526
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:52,000
except of course when I was back
at school.

527
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,667
He’s why you came here.

528
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:59,000
Thierry, I came because of you.

529
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:02,167
And Louie came because of me.

530
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:09,292
Those are such simple rules of love
between people.

531
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,125
Can’t you accept that?

532
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,167
I mean, it’s between you and me.

533
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,250
It’s between you and Zan.

534
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,793
And it’s between me and Louie.

535
00:49:29,751 --> 00:49:32,001
And your husband?
Where was he?

536
00:49:35,793 --> 00:49:38,126
I don’t regret anything.

537
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,127
Why?

538
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:09,043
- Why what?
- Why did you do it?

539
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:11,586
Why’d I do what?

540
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:14,502
Why’d you marry him?

541
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:18,085
He was a poet.

542
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:20,960
He was pretty good, too.

543
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:24,586
And what about this?

544
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:27,587
Isn’t this poetry?

545
00:50:30,587 --> 00:50:31,753
I don’t know.

546
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:36,378
I don’t know.

547
00:50:41,253 --> 00:50:42,253
Zan!

548
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:16,463
Zan.

549
00:51:17,671 --> 00:51:18,629
No.

550
00:51:19,129 --> 00:51:21,546
This is your game, Zan.

551
00:51:23,212 --> 00:51:24,129
No.

552
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:25,337
Yes.

553
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,421
Thierry.

554
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,504
What did you say?

555
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:35,714
Fuck me.

556
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:37,547
All the time.
Anyway you want.

557
00:51:45,422 --> 00:51:46,964
He’s my husband.

558
00:51:47,797 --> 00:51:49,046
And I wanna hump here.

559
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:58,963
Say my name.

560
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:00,964
Say my name.

561
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,922
You can say it.

562
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:07,464
Johnny.

563
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:14,047
I can’t do this anymore.

564
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,465
I can’t be what you want me
to be.

565
00:52:21,214 --> 00:52:22,423
Yes, you can.

566
00:52:26,756 --> 00:52:27,882
It’s not me.

567
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:37,173
You can be what I want
you to be.

568
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:40,214
You just have to relax.

569
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,507
When I’m inside you

570
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,132
I feel lost at the edge of the universe.

571
00:53:01,466 --> 00:53:03,257
Travelling, exploring.

572
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:06,549
Roll over on your stomach.

573
00:53:20,592 --> 00:53:23,425
- I won’t do drugs.
- I’m not asking you to.

574
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:30,091
Where else can you express
this need to free our bodies?

575
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:35,091
And we’ll fuck like animals.

576
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,550
In the altar of the primal.

577
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:54,635
Look, all I got is twenty bucks, okay?

578
00:54:54,635 --> 00:54:56,219
I’ll give you a good deal.
All right?

579
00:54:57,553 --> 00:54:58,470
Sit down.

580
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:01,219
Come on, give me the money.

581
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,595
Can’t you do this someplace else?

582
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:10,094
<i>- It’s a free country.
-Do you want me to call the cops?</i>

583
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:12,887
- I’ve already called them.
- Come on.

584
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:14,511
Calm down.

585
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:15,887
- Come on.
- Get!

586
00:55:16,094 --> 00:55:18,386
- And don’t come back here!
- Nice slip, asshole.

587
00:55:19,011 --> 00:55:19,636
Jesus!

588
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,761
The Quarter is a pit.

589
00:55:24,136 --> 00:55:27,470
Now, Zandalee, honey, don’t go
blaming it on the Quarter.

590
00:55:27,761 --> 00:55:29,762
When everybody’s always
raggin’ on the Quarter.

591
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:32,971
It’s not just the Quarter, honey,
it’s everyware.

592
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,387
- Thank you, Scarlet.
- Well, it’s true.

593
00:55:37,053 --> 00:55:39,304
I’ll tell you a little ‘once upon a time’
story.

594
00:55:40,095 --> 00:55:41,679
I had an uncle Arthur.

595
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:45,929
He had a wonderful job,
sold it to the highest bidder.

596
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:48,804
And, honey, he was sheriff.

597
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:51,970
You can sell anything in this country.

598
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,220
Anything.

599
00:55:53,846 --> 00:55:55,971
Would you please tell Tatta
I’m going to lunch?

600
00:55:57,137 --> 00:55:58,471
And I’m not invited?

601
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:02,596
All right, I’ll cover your little liaison.

602
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,930
It takes the pressure off.

603
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:06,805
You keep sayin’ that, honey.

604
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:57,514
<i>Johnny, where you been?</i>

605
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,264
<i>I’m praying for you, why don’t you
call me sometime</i>

606
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:06,764
Hey, Bro, what are you at?

607
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:09,556
Did you get canned?

608
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:11,973
Promoted.

609
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,599
How do you get promoted
when you’re already the boss?

610
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,348
Well, I’m not the boss.

611
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:20,932
It’s not my father’s company
anymore.

612
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,432
Congratulations.

613
00:57:22,765 --> 00:57:25,599
Yes, congratulations.

614
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,640
You’re turning out to be real
executive dude.

615
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:33,807
- Look, I’m on lunch break.
- Yes, I know.

616
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:35,640
I took care of it.

617
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:37,182
Take a seat.

618
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:39,474
Thanks.

619
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:42,765
- Do you wanna share my peach?
- No, thanks.

620
00:57:44,516 --> 00:57:47,725
<i>Mr. Allen, pick up line three,
I’m serious.</i>

621
00:57:51,725 --> 00:57:54,141
Seems you’ve been taking
some awfully long lunches.

622
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:57,308
- Yeah, I had personal business.
- Yes.

623
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:58,725
I’ve imagined.

624
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:03,558
I’ve been savin’ you
from getting fired.

625
00:58:04,391 --> 00:58:05,433
Should I?

626
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:07,683
I don’t need saving, Thier.

627
00:58:08,641 --> 00:58:09,600
Are we through here?

628
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:12,433
Do you have somewhere to go?

629
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:14,974
Just back to work

630
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:19,225
You have a mistress, don’t you?

631
00:58:20,726 --> 00:58:21,809
I’m not married.

632
00:58:24,184 --> 00:58:25,225
I understand.

633
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:27,476
You understand?

634
00:58:28,726 --> 00:58:31,809
If you compromise your honor
you lose everything

635
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,142
and God help you then.

636
00:58:35,517 --> 00:58:37,100
Congratulations on your promotion.

637
00:58:54,143 --> 00:58:55,685
<i>Sweetcakes, it’s your Remy.</i>

638
00:58:56,685 --> 00:58:58,226
<i>Sweetheart, are you there?</i>

639
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,101
<i>Pick up</i>

640
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:02,560
<i>Johnny</i>

641
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:03,935
<i>Johnn...</i>

642
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:42,227
<i>When you’re smiling,</i>

643
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:45,311
<i>when you’re smiling,</i>

644
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:49,394
<i>the whole world smiles with you.</i>

645
00:59:51,436 --> 00:59:53,269
<i>When you’re laughing,</i>

646
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:55,811
<i>when you’re laughing,</i>

647
00:59:56,603 --> 00:59:59,645
<i>the sun comes shining through.</i>

648
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:02,896
<i>But when you’re crying,</i>

649
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:06,103
<i>you just bring on the rain.</i>

650
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,187
<i>So stop your crying</i>

651
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,187
<i>Come on.</i>

652
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:11,103
<i>Be happy again.</i>

653
01:00:12,187 --> 01:00:13,604
<When you’re smiling...

654
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,312
I didn’t stand you up.

655
01:00:29,978 --> 01:00:31,688
Somebody at work got ahold on me.

656
01:00:33,646 --> 01:00:34,813
How’d you find me?

657
01:00:35,104 --> 01:00:36,229
How’d I find you?

658
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:38,354
I know everything about you.

659
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:42,980
Come here.

660
01:00:44,396 --> 01:00:45,313
Don’t.

661
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,980
Don’t do that here.

662
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:55,021
I want you to move in with me.

663
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:57,521
No.

664
01:00:58,062 --> 01:00:59,313
It’d kill him.

665
01:01:01,605 --> 01:01:03,438
Let me tell you somethin’
about people.

666
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:07,063
People die and people die.

667
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:08,898
Everybody dies,

668
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:10,564
so, leave him.

669
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:13,105
Don’t talk like that.

670
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:16,314
Why don’t you think of
where you are?

671
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:22,898
God can hear us better in here, huh?
Yeah?

672
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:25,564
Well, fuck!

673
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,063
Shit.

674
01:01:27,063 --> 01:01:29,772
Strike me down, Lord, because
if you can’t fuckin’ leave him,

675
01:01:29,772 --> 01:01:31,230
I’ll make you fuckin’ leave him!

676
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,898
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Come here!

677
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:40,482
Aren’t we the real church?

678
01:01:41,899 --> 01:01:44,482
Isn’t this the way He really
shows Himself to us?

679
01:01:45,899 --> 01:01:46,940
Isn’t it?

680
01:01:50,981 --> 01:01:52,190
With this...

681
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,356
true miracle,

682
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:56,064
this gift.

683
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:15,357
Thank you, Father.

684
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:25,983
I freed you.

685
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:27,941
You know that.

686
01:02:30,774 --> 01:02:32,982
Okay.
Okay, okay.

687
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:06,108
Zan!

688
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:16,567
Hey, you!
Where are you going?

689
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,276
Come on, Tatta.

690
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:45,193
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

691
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:46,860
I couldn’t guess it.

692
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:51,568
Hi, Zandalee.

693
01:03:51,902 --> 01:03:53,068
Hello, Zan.

694
01:03:53,444 --> 01:03:54,652
Oh, no! The same.

695
01:03:56,194 --> 01:03:58,611
I don’t know what to do to win.

696
01:04:02,652 --> 01:04:03,736
Do you wanna play with us?

697
01:04:04,444 --> 01:04:05,486
No, thank you.

698
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:11,819
I’ll be right back.

699
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,402
You know, Zan.

700
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:27,695
Most marriages suffer,

701
01:04:29,986 --> 01:04:31,403
but the good ones conquer.

702
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:34,945
Not without a fight, though.

703
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,153
Don’t be afraid.

704
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:49,195
The longer you look at the problems
the bigger they get.

705
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:51,278
That’s true for the solutions, too.

706
01:04:54,778 --> 01:04:56,111
Just go to him.

707
01:04:57,445 --> 01:04:58,778
He is your husband.

708
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:02,863
Talk to him.

709
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,112
Make him talk to you.

710
01:05:31,446 --> 01:05:32,988
We really have to talk.

711
01:05:34,822 --> 01:05:35,864
All right.

712
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:38,739
Let’s be civilized.

713
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:41,655
Hello.

714
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:44,363
Hello.

715
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:49,530
- I just need you to know...
- No!

716
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,697
I don’t want to know.

717
01:05:53,988 --> 01:05:58,280
All I know is I don’t want to know
anything.

718
01:06:00,822 --> 01:06:01,947
I don’t.

719
01:06:14,072 --> 01:06:15,907
- Christ!
- Thierry.

720
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:18,865
- I thought I...
- Goddamnit!

721
01:06:20,072 --> 01:06:21,948
I can give you absolution!

722
01:06:22,573 --> 01:06:23,656
I’m not your confessor!

723
01:06:54,324 --> 01:06:56,491
I tried to quit Southern Comm.

724
01:06:57,574 --> 01:06:58,532
Good.

725
01:06:59,365 --> 01:07:00,574
Good?

726
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:06,782
I couldn’t quit.

727
01:07:09,449 --> 01:07:10,824
But it’ll free you.

728
01:07:13,073 --> 01:07:13,824
Like you.

729
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
<i>Western wind,
when will thou blow?</i>

730
01:07:26,867 --> 01:07:29,408
<i>The small rain down can rain.</i>

731
01:07:31,492 --> 01:07:33,909
<i>Christ that my love were
in my arms</i>

732
01:07:35,909 --> 01:07:37,617
<i>and I’m in my bed again.</i>

733
01:07:45,283 --> 01:07:46,325
Remember that?

734
01:07:48,326 --> 01:07:49,951
We don’t know how to talk.

735
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:53,159
We don’t know how to fuck.

736
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,534
I’m sorry.

737
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:06,784
I’m sorry too.

738
01:08:09,451 --> 01:08:12,951
But sorry’s gonne get us but a pool
of tears and a box of Kleenex.

739
01:08:19,992 --> 01:08:22,869
Let’s just go away for awhile
just the two of us.

740
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:26,785
Leave everything behind.

741
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,702
Start clean.

742
01:08:57,661 --> 01:08:59,536
- Johnny, how you doin’, man?
- All right.

743
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:01,912
- How’s the art comin’?
- Well, I haven’t had much time.

744
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:03,994
I hear you show sold out?

745
01:09:03,994 --> 01:09:06,786
Yeah, big bucks in the Big Apple.

746
01:09:08,036 --> 01:09:10,953
Listen, let me give you my card,
then you can give me a call,

747
01:09:11,495 --> 01:09:14,244
and I’ll give you the scoop,
you know, just like old times.

748
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:15,828
- All right.
- You look good, man.

749
01:09:22,244 --> 01:09:25,411
I told him I’d give him ten dollars to
come over to my yard with his horse

750
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,244
and fertilize my flowers.

751
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:29,454
Skunk.

752
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:32,621
You’re drunk as a skunk.

753
01:09:34,746 --> 01:09:35,913
Mr. Collins.

754
01:09:36,954 --> 01:09:40,162
- Did Pepe leave anything for me?
- He say you owe him blind.

755
01:09:40,162 --> 01:09:41,913
You know him, he’s always
shootin’ off.

756
01:09:41,913 --> 01:09:44,037
We worked out a friend schedule,
it’s okay.

757
01:09:44,329 --> 01:09:46,037
I don’t want trouble
around here tonight,

758
01:09:46,037 --> 01:09:48,662
I’m thinkin’ maybe you oughta
leave off the stuff for a while.

759
01:09:48,662 --> 01:09:50,662
- Well, he gave me this, didn’t he?
- Yeah.

760
01:09:56,162 --> 01:09:57,746
So, where’s your wife tonight?

761
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:01,412
Runnin’ around.

762
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:05,455
She took a lover.

763
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:08,413
I think so.

764
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,121
Christ, Thierry, what’s
the world comin’ to?

765
01:10:12,872 --> 01:10:14,830
No, no, we’re gonna work it out.

766
01:10:16,205 --> 01:10:18,205
Starting tomorrow a new contract.

767
01:10:19,872 --> 01:10:22,788
My forgiveness, her absolution.

768
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,497
Goin’ to the Bayou and there
it’ll begin.

769
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:29,955
Bayou Tesche?

770
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,497
Goin’ to the old spot we used to fish?

771
01:10:35,705 --> 01:10:36,831
<i>Exactly.</i>

772
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:39,997
Where else in there to go
on earth?

773
01:10:44,998 --> 01:10:46,998
Jack, hit me for the road, my friend.

774
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:54,331
And judgin’ by your size
I mean figuratively speakin’ to us.

775
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:59,164
A gentlemen politely holds his say
in polite company

776
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:01,748
except when honor is a stake,

777
01:11:01,748 --> 01:11:04,206
and then it’s to the proverbial
duellin’ oak.

778
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,207
Honor.

779
01:11:11,457 --> 01:11:13,415
Honor.
Who cares?

780
01:11:16,874 --> 01:11:18,457
Lies and manipulation,

781
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:20,916
these are the duellin’ blades
of the day, Jack.

782
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,290
Do you know who this guy is?

783
01:11:26,874 --> 01:11:27,999
Johnny.

784
01:11:28,373 --> 01:11:31,165
For all I know, it could be you.

785
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,541
You know, I should despise
this lover of hers,

786
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:48,791
but I don’t.

787
01:11:51,124 --> 01:11:52,791
I should despise myself

788
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,374
for bein’ grateful to him
for satisfyin’ my Zan.

789
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:00,208
But I don’t.

790
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,625
This has nothin’ to do with Zan.

791
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:06,666
You’re lost.

792
01:12:09,249 --> 01:12:12,124
Lost and found.
Lost and found.

793
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:14,917
I know what I’m doin’.

794
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,334
<i>Good bye, Johnny.</i>

795
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:26,000
I can’t stand up, I’ll fall down.

796
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:34,918
Drank like a king
now I’m sick as a dog.

797
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:39,083
Yep, that’s a pretty nauseating
way for us to start clean.

798
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,876
Don’t make me laugh.
Damn!

799
01:12:45,334 --> 01:12:47,083
Why?
It hurts when you laugh?

800
01:12:47,459 --> 01:12:48,417
Worse.

801
01:12:49,459 --> 01:12:52,168
Looks like you need St. Soda Pop
real quick.

802
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:08,585
That was mean.

803
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,627
I don’t know why I do these things.

804
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:15,251
I guess I’m still just white trash.

805
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:26,169
You were born a century too late.

806
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:31,586
I’m outta step and I don’t fit in.

807
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,503
My biggest problem, however,
seems to be I don’t care to.

808
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,586
We’re gonna be okay.

809
01:14:00,128 --> 01:14:01,295
God, you’re beautiful.

810
01:14:07,295 --> 01:14:08,712
Just let me look.

811
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,171
See?

812
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:36,796
All the parts work.

813
01:14:38,755 --> 01:14:41,713
I don’t wanna disturb you, baby,
would you tie us off?

814
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,004
I’ll wait here.

815
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,796
And you’re hot.

816
01:15:04,714 --> 01:15:06,005
Hold at that.

817
01:15:24,214 --> 01:15:25,589
<i>It’s out of order again</i>

818
01:15:25,964 --> 01:15:27,756
<i>- Bonjour
- Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

819
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:35,255
Nice sparkle beetles.

820
01:15:36,255 --> 01:15:37,380
I’m after catfish.

821
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:40,757
I got some fresh done stink bait, but
you can’t cook with your wife at home.

822
01:15:42,173 --> 01:15:45,006
You gonna go for catfish,
you got to use chicken blood.

823
01:15:46,924 --> 01:15:48,882
Chicken blood’ll get you a cat.

824
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:53,632
Hello.

825
01:15:57,381 --> 01:15:58,507
Where you at, Bro?

826
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:04,924
What took you so long?

827
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:08,381
Guess you knew you made
me jealous and longing

828
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:10,007
with all you talk about Bayou.

829
01:16:12,007 --> 01:16:13,090
Zan’s right outside.

830
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:17,216
Sure I won’t be imposing?

831
01:16:19,716 --> 01:16:21,132
There’s time for everything.

832
01:16:24,382 --> 01:16:25,799
Look at the stray I’ve found.

833
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:47,008
Let’s take a turn.

834
01:16:52,009 --> 01:16:53,383
Let’s show her how it is done.

835
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:55,884
Come on.

836
01:18:23,469 --> 01:18:24,552
You remember?

837
01:18:39,345 --> 01:18:41,012
- Who wants a beer?
- I’ll take one.

838
01:18:41,678 --> 01:18:42,595
Come and get it then.

839
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:44,929
I’ll bring it to you all right.

840
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:04,387
I came to take you home.

841
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:07,221
It’s over.

842
01:19:07,888 --> 01:19:08,804
You don’t love him.

843
01:19:10,596 --> 01:19:12,763
If you would leave me alone,
I would forever.

844
01:19:13,554 --> 01:19:14,513
Thierry?

845
01:19:16,387 --> 01:19:17,262
Thierry.

846
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:32,846
Thierry, you can really fucking
going coon-ass, man.

847
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:37,180
You come to the back woods and
the back woods they come to you.

848
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:44,639
It’s over.

849
01:19:56,222 --> 01:19:57,597
Who’s for some fishin’?

850
01:20:33,765 --> 01:20:35,264
Mr. Christian?

851
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:42,557
Hey.

852
01:20:43,057 --> 01:20:44,766
Isn’t our old spot the other way?

853
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:47,516
No, no, no, this way, farther up.

854
01:20:48,474 --> 01:20:51,682
Who cares about your old spot?
Let’s just get somewhere.

855
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:53,807
Out, out, damn spot.

856
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,933
Who would have thought the old man
could have so much blood in him?

857
01:20:58,849 --> 01:21:00,974
Why don’t you let me take over
for a minute?

858
01:21:04,724 --> 01:21:06,766
Jesus Christ!
Watch out!

859
01:21:07,015 --> 01:21:08,265
Gunboat Collin’s back.

860
01:21:22,725 --> 01:21:24,475
We used to do this as kids.

861
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:25,850
Slow down!

862
01:21:26,975 --> 01:21:29,767
What for?
This is what it’s all about.

863
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:32,767
Somebody’s gonna get hurt.

864
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:34,850
Faster!

865
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,517
Where’s your blood, Zan?

866
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,058
Faster!

867
01:21:39,725 --> 01:21:41,391
Get that fucker!

868
01:21:47,183 --> 01:21:49,809
- What’s gotten into you?
- Snakes!

869
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:05,226
Thierry!

870
01:22:06,559 --> 01:22:07,476
Thierry!

871
01:22:12,601 --> 01:22:14,392
You and I are gonna settle
something.

872
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:15,559
Right.

873
01:22:16,226 --> 01:22:17,809
We’re gonna settle it now!

874
01:22:24,393 --> 01:22:26,227
He’s caught in the hyacinth!

875
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:38,352
Thierry!

876
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:30,939
Hey, you got any money?

877
01:24:33,897 --> 01:24:34,813
How you doin’?

878
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:37,022
I’m not carrying any.

879
01:24:37,981 --> 01:24:39,356
No? It’s all right.

880
01:24:40,606 --> 01:24:42,314
Do you want some chicken
and biscuits?

881
01:24:43,523 --> 01:24:45,606
No, I’m a vegetarian.

882
01:24:47,773 --> 01:24:49,356
Shit, how you been?
You look terrible.

883
01:24:53,981 --> 01:24:55,147
I killed my husband.

884
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:00,856
Is this his grave?

885
01:25:01,606 --> 01:25:02,439
Yeah.

886
01:25:07,231 --> 01:25:08,439
They say he drowned.

887
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,857
How can you drown
when you can swim?

888
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:19,732
Nah, some big did dude of yoren’s
done him gone with a knife

889
01:25:19,732 --> 01:25:20,941
while you just laid back.

890
01:25:22,398 --> 01:25:23,398
Am I right or right?

891
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:30,398
It’s like I always say, be careful
what you want, you might just get it.

892
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:32,732
I never wanted this.

893
01:25:33,482 --> 01:25:36,190
Speak it once in the heart an amen,
hallelujah, it’s there.

894
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:38,941
That’s a religious heart-of-fact.

895
01:25:44,733 --> 01:25:46,107
You don’t got a light, do you?

896
01:25:48,107 --> 01:25:48,942
No.

897
01:25:52,441 --> 01:25:53,566
I’m fine.

898
01:25:59,316 --> 01:26:00,399
I’m fine.

899
01:26:11,816 --> 01:26:12,650
I’m fine.

900
01:26:18,026 --> 01:26:18,984
<i>I’m fine</i>

901
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:35,943
<i>Collins, your ass is shot.
Over and out.</i>

902
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,025
<i>Gotta make accounts
payable, man.</i>

903
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:41,317
<i>Pepe says as Pepe don’t jive.</i>

904
01:26:51,735 --> 01:26:54,401
Ants.
I detest them.

905
01:26:58,652 --> 01:27:01,360
If only one of them could pick up
a needle and sew.

906
01:27:06,026 --> 01:27:08,151
I think we need to poison
the intruders.

907
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:11,568
Yeah, I better go to the market.

908
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,610
- I’ll go honey.
- No.

909
01:27:16,026 --> 01:27:17,026
I’ll get it.

910
01:27:26,569 --> 01:27:28,861
Line me up.
Tequila.

911
01:27:32,486 --> 01:27:33,361
Three.

912
01:27:34,986 --> 01:27:36,861
Man, you oughta lay off this stuff.

913
01:27:37,569 --> 01:27:38,861
Nice to see you, too.

914
01:27:44,028 --> 01:27:45,736
Those faggots fired me.

915
01:27:47,986 --> 01:27:49,152
Hell, you been showin’ up?

916
01:27:53,027 --> 01:27:54,861
Screw that cable shit anyhow.

917
01:27:59,737 --> 01:28:01,070
Take you a vacation somewhere.

918
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,195
Get away for me for a while,
you know what I mean?

919
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:07,070
I’m not worried, I don’t care
the things happen for a reason.

920
01:28:07,403 --> 01:28:08,403
I gotta be painting.

921
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:10,570
Painting.

922
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:13,862
Where’s the bottle.

923
01:28:18,195 --> 01:28:19,987
Do you dig it, Rog?
Do you dig it?

924
01:28:21,278 --> 01:28:22,111
It’s all right.

925
01:28:22,654 --> 01:28:24,612
Has a sense of action to it,
don’t you think?

926
01:28:24,612 --> 01:28:26,695
I really captured brutality,
in fact, here.

927
01:28:27,028 --> 01:28:29,070
I feel good about it.
And I didn’t use drugs.

928
01:28:31,571 --> 01:28:32,613
This is excellent.

929
01:28:32,613 --> 01:28:35,571
This is really the best one, to me
you really broke free on this one.

930
01:28:35,571 --> 01:28:36,488
That’s an old one.

931
01:28:37,071 --> 01:28:39,363
But it’s really good direction
that you’re heading in.

932
01:28:39,363 --> 01:28:41,404
As far as I am concerned
you could be fucking dead!

933
01:28:41,404 --> 01:28:44,988
You made a mistake. It’s a Picasso!
That’s it. So get the fuck outta here!

934
01:28:48,446 --> 01:28:50,321
<i>- Do you wanna a cup of coffe?
- No.</i>

935
01:28:50,738 --> 01:28:52,279
Just call me when you get
Some new work.

936
01:28:52,279 --> 01:28:53,905
Yeah, okay.
Take it easy.

937
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:15,781
Damn!

938
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:24,405
Die!

939
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:28,197
Die! Die!
Fuckin’ die!

940
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,781
Die! Die!

941
01:29:32,697 --> 01:29:33,989
Just die!

942
01:29:42,573 --> 01:29:43,573
Fuck you!

943
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:46,782
Fuck you!

944
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:52,949
Black it out! Black it out!
Black it out!

945
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,907
Black it out!
Black it out!

946
01:30:45,867 --> 01:30:46,909
The door was open.

947
01:30:57,325 --> 01:30:58,617
I’ve been havin’...

948
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:02,992
a kind of a strange time.

949
01:31:07,575 --> 01:31:08,659
I’m sick,

950
01:31:11,784 --> 01:31:12,784
disgusted.

951
01:31:25,326 --> 01:31:28,701
I tried saving him, but he didn’t
wanna be saved.

952
01:31:31,701 --> 01:31:33,076
He wanted to be let go.

953
01:31:34,368 --> 01:31:35,743
You wanted it.

954
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:39,243
Not just me.

955
01:31:41,368 --> 01:31:44,409
When I go in my kitchen
to make toast

956
01:31:44,409 --> 01:31:46,076
I smell your skin.

957
01:31:48,701 --> 01:31:50,034
I can’t get you out of me.

958
01:31:54,619 --> 01:31:56,202
You don’t know anything
about love.

959
01:31:59,661 --> 01:32:00,577
Zan.

960
01:32:00,577 --> 01:32:02,619
How can you know anything
about it?

961
01:32:10,786 --> 01:32:12,577
I’ll never be rid of you.

962
01:32:27,787 --> 01:32:28,745
Thierry.

963
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:42,832
Johnny!

964
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:15,500
Johnny!

965
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:22,166
No.

966
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:23,124
No!

967
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,375
No!

968
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,250
You gotta make accounts
payable, man.
