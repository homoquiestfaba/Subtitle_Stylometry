00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:07,700
HERO

2
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:13,689
Two thousand years ago...
During the Warring States period,
China was divided into seven Kingdoms.

3
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,411
For years they battled for supremacy,
while the people suffered.

4
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:22,920
The King of Qin was the most ruthless
in his efforts to conquer the land
and unify all under heaven.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,589
He was regarded as a common threat
by the other six Kingdoms.

6
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:31,036
The annals of Chinese history are 
abound with tales of the assassins
sent to kill the great King.

7
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:37,215
This is one of the legends...

8
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,055
I was orphaned at an early age.

9
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:24,200
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,216
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship.

11
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:31,046
After 10 years of practice,
I acquired a unique skill.

12
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,284
The King of Qin has summoned me.

13
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:36,766
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom.

14
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,494
By order of His Majesty,
we have brought the mighty warrior.

15
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,901
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword,

16
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:42,786
The three assassins from Zhao,
have sought His Majesty's life for 10 years.

17
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:46,711
His Majesty has known no peace.

18
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:48,959
To the astonishment of all,

19
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,789
a mighty warrior of Qin has smashed them!

20
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:58,014
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

21
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:00,592
We rejoice for our King!

22
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:04,627
This warrior sent from Heaven
has exterminated the assassins.

23
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:20,474
Summon the warrior!

24
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:58,740
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty,

25
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,049
or you will be executed.
Never forget that.

26
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:34,824
No one is allowed
within 100 paces of me.

27
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,519
Do you know why?

28
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,575
To guard against assassins.

29
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:42,495
Yes. That's why I am
confined in this armor.

30
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:45,920
You have removed a great peril for me.

31
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,980
How shall I reward you?

32
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,704
My service was for Qin,
not for a reward.

33
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:53,949
Achievements must be rewarded.

34
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,182
Sky's silver spear...

35
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,610
It has wounded many of my brave warriors.

36
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,173
Announce my edict!

37
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:14,760
By order of His Majesty,
he who kills Sky will receive gold and land,

38
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,103
and be allowed to drink
within 20 paces of His Majesty.

39
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:36,721
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin.

40
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:39,336
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County.

41
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:42,716
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

42
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,839
Surely the lowest-ranking
official in Qin.

43
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,067
How did you defeat such opponents?

44
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,216
I took them on one by one.

45
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,656
Tell me the details.

46
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:57,375
Does Your Majesty know that
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

47
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,978
Yes, I do.

48
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,132
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

49
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:04,522
For three years?
Why?

50
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:08,154
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky.

51
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,380
Broken Sword never forgave her.

52
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,177
Why haven't I heard this before?

53
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:16,652
I went to great lengths
to uncover it.

54
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:22,003
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword,
I first needed to eliminate Sky.

55
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,786
I have an idea of what you planned.

56
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,639
Your Majesty is wise.

57
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,274
What did you use to defeat Sky?

58
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:31,913
A sword.

59
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:37,147
I must arrest criminals in my county.

60
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:41,188
On the fifth day of the sixth month,
Sky attended a chess house.

61
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:46,213
I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess
and listening to music there.

62
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,901
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace.

63
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,502
We are here to arrest you!

64
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:13,622
Identify yourself
by showing your spear.

65
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,424
Halt!

66
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,319
What can a minor official do?

67
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,184
This is my territory.

68
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,480
So?

69
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,673
You are on the King's most wanted list.

70
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:06,756
I am placing you under arrest.

71
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,569
Old man,

72
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,167
please play one more tune.

73
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:10,388
Martial arts and music are different,
but they share the same principle.

74
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:14,346
Both stress attaining a supreme state.

75
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:18,704
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time.

76
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:25,157
Neither of us moved.
We fought the battle in our minds.

77
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,027
How swift thy sword!

78
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:15,458
I thought I knew everything 
about my Kingdom.

79
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:21,075
I didn't know that Leng Meng County
held a talent like yours.

80
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,434
Broken Sword

81
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,618
Flying Snow

82
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:31,912
By order of His Majesty!

83
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:36,237
Flying Snow and Broken Sword
have teamed up for assassination.

84
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:41,653
He who kills either of them
will receive gold and land,

85
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:45,492
and be allowed to drink
within 10 paces of His Majesty.

86
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:58,175
Three years ago, Flying Snow
stormed the palace with Broken Sword.

87
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:02,552
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them.

88
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,796
I've since emptied the palace,

89
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:09,864
so assassins cannot hide.

90
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:13,009
Was your sword swifter than theirs combined?

91
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,177
No.

92
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:19,104
How did you do it, then?

93
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:32,660
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao,
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao.

94
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,174
I learned they were hiding in a calligraphy 
school under the names Highcliff and Springbrook.

95
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:41,381
Rumor had it that
the Qin army would attack that day.

96
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:46,535
Most of the townspeople had fled.
Only the school's students remained.

97
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,824
Why have you come at this time?

98
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,417
Who are you?

99
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,917
I'm from Yi County in the Kingdom of Zhao.

100
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:58,806
My father's dying wish
was for one of your scrolls.

101
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:02,949
I fear this may be our school's last day.

102
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:06,201
Which calligrapher do you seek?

103
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,071
I respectfully request Master Highcliff.

104
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:10,602
Highcliff was Broken Sword.

105
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:16,977
Legend said his skill as a swordsman
was rooted in his calligraphy.

106
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,863
So I had my concerns.
I needed to find out if it were true.

107
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,025
What do you want written?

108
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,271
"Sword"

109
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,872
You are fond of the sword?

110
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:33,896
It was my father's dying wish.

111
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:44,264
What size scroll?

112
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:46,621
Eight feet.

113
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,535
For that size I will need red ink.

114
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:55,163
My master asked me
to borrow some red ink.

115
00:16:57,772 --> 00:17:01,124
My master wants to borrow some red ink.

116
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,146
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

117
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,825
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink.

118
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:16,171
Tell him to come himself.

119
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:32,452
May I have some red ink?

120
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,864
The character "sword"
was still being written

121
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,874
when Your Majesty's troops
arrived at the city gates.

122
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:19,496
Your Majesty's army is invincible,
not only because it is brave,

123
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:25,501
but also because of its archery.
With a greater range than any other army,

124
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:32,103
the Qin archers are like artillery,
intimidating the enemy.

125
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:46,181
Hail! Hail! Hail!

126
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:33,290
Please remember,
their arrows might destroy our town,

127
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,814
and topple our Kingdom,

128
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:40,613
but they can never
obliterate our culture.

129
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:47,479
Today you will learn
the essence of our culture.

130
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,472
Hail! Hail! Hail!

131
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,816
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

132
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:39,073
They drew strength from their calligraphy.

133
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:41,744
What was so difficult about "sword"?

134
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:44,462
There are 19 different ways to write it.

135
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:49,201
I asked Broken Sword for a 20th way.

136
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:52,940
Both calligraphy and swordplay
rely on one's strength and spirit.

137
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,145
The 20th style would reveal
the essence of his swordsmanship.

138
00:21:57,145 --> 00:22:00,390
How odd to write it in 19 ways.

139
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,263
It makes the written language

140
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:04,261
impossible to comprehend.

141
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:09,085
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms
and all the northern tribes,

142
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:12,809
I will eradicate this problem
by mandating one style of writing.

143
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,473
Wouldn't that be ideal?

144
00:22:16,473 --> 00:22:18,535
Your Majesty won't stop at the six Kingdoms?

145
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:23,351
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

146
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:26,770
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands
and establish a great empire.

147
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:31,382
Hail! Hail! Hail!

148
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:01,836
Master Springbrook.

149
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:03,958
Why are you going outside?

150
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,508
To fend off the arrows.

151
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:08,073
You aren't needed.
Stay inside.

152
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:11,163
The Qin archers are powerful.

153
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:13,158
You alone may not stop them.

154
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,857
Hail! Hail! Hail!

155
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:18,842
You're good.

156
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,908
You are even better.

157
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:24,220
You didn't come here for calligraphy.

158
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:26,442
Who are you?

159
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:30,040
I've travelled here to deliver an item.

160
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,876
Please meet me in the library at midnight.

161
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,699
Great calligraphy.

162
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:44,201
Great swordplay.

163
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:46,439
You didn't even see my swordplay.

164
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:49,316
I couldn't have written without it.

165
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:54,751
At midnight,
meet me in the library.

166
00:25:55,298 --> 00:26:01,338
Several thousand Qin troops
were readying for the next onslaught.

167
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:04,218
I studied the character all night,

168
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:07,720
trying to unlock the secret of his skills.

169
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,005
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

170
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:24,256
But it's just an ordinary word.

171
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:27,891
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar.

172
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:30,472
One must comprehend their true essence.

173
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:32,923
Did you discover it?

174
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,519
It eluded me.

175
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:38,383
So how did you challenge them?

176
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,133
Sky died by your sword?

177
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,490
Yes.

178
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:57,985
Who are you? 
Why are you here?

179
00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:01,748
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin.
I have a message from Sky.

180
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:02,989
Go on.

181
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:06,895
He said he lived a life
without responsibilities or commitments.

182
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:09,179
He cared for only one person.

183
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:11,159
Who?

184
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,701
Flying Snow.

185
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,910
Sky was certain she'd avenge his death.

186
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:40,348
To fight me,
meet me at the Qin camp.

187
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:41,154
You can leave now.

188
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:46,703
Go!

189
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:14,046
I know you saw us!

190
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,273
I let you see us on purpose!

191
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:25,472
I no longer care about you at all!

192
00:31:54,615 --> 00:31:57,668
We were both very foolish.

193
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,913
I'm not going to fight you.

194
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:53,794
Leave!

195
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:59,942
I will kill you
in honor of my master!

196
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:59,746
You ask to die. I shall help you.

197
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:18,886
Why do you laugh?

198
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:22,594
What you did last night was stupid.

199
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:03,715
My plan proved successful.

200
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:08,993
When Flying Snow was fighting me
she was disturbed and disoriented.

201
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,491
I defeated her easily.

202
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,139
I never imagined supreme warriors

203
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,652
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow
would allow their emotions to be a liability.

204
00:37:47,286 --> 00:37:50,885
It sounds as if you did divide them.

205
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,061
Yes.

206
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,432
In that case, they must have been
petty and narrow-minded.

207
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:57,589
True.

208
00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:00,140
Your story sounds logical.

209
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,737
But,

210
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,952
you have underestimated one person.

211
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:06,905
Who?

212
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:08,689
Me.

213
00:38:09,218 --> 00:38:13,289
Would you like
my impression of them?

214
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:16,804
Three years ago,
they stormed the palace.

215
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:21,001
I was impressed
by their valor and dignity.

216
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:23,501
Their character could not be petty.

217
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,819
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie.

218
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,509
Their betrayal of one another is a lie.

219
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:30,471
The story you just told is a lie!

220
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:41,714
Except for one thing:
Sky did know one of you.

221
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:43,855
Who?

222
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,300
You.

223
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:49,994
I surmise you two were old friends,

224
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:53,502
and Sky's defeat has only one explanation.

225
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:55,164
What's that?

226
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:58,217
He permitted it.

227
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:05,251
To kill me,

228
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:09,371
the two of you formed a pact,
using my men as witnesses.

229
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:11,685
That was not hard to arrange.

230
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:15,954
The hardest part was to persuade Sky
to put his life in your hands.

231
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,098
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky.

232
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:22,154
He died willingly under your sword.

233
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,634
Such devotion deserves true respect.

234
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:28,288
He was the first to sacrifice himself
for your mission.

235
00:39:30,364 --> 00:39:31,370
Sky was proud.

236
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,627
He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter.

237
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:36,336
What convinced him you could succeed,

238
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:39,416
where he had failed?

239
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:46,521
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years,
with one goal, my assassination.

240
00:39:46,521 --> 00:39:49,297
You have a great skill that few can counter.

241
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,579
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me.

242
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,503
So why seek out Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

243
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:11,393
I surmise that your skill
requires you to come within 10 paces.

244
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:14,616
You needed a second sacrifice
to claim another reward

245
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:17,905
to bring you within 10 paces.

246
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:24,273
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow
had never met Sky,

247
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:28,723
they instantly understood
the reason for his defeat.

248
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,739
How far am I from the bookshelves?

249
00:40:43,827 --> 00:40:45,409
About 10 paces.

250
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,793
10 paces is fine.
