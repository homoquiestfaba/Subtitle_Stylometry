1
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:05,004
[music, glass shatters]

2
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,795
- [Voice-over] What
you are looking at is

3
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,532
250 million light years away.

4
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,769
This means that it
took 250 million years

5
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:40,706
for the light from those
stars to reach our eyes.

6
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,777
We are thus, at present,
staring into the past.

7
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,533
(sighs)

8
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,772
- My dad died during my
sophomore year of college.

9
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,341
For five years, Mom
kept a strong front

10
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,411
as she wanted us to
move on with our lives.

11
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,890
Mom, do you have a
favorite designer?

12
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,159
- No. (chuckles)

13
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,595
- Didn't you want to be one?

14
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,096
- Yes.

15
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,233
- So, how is it that you
don't have a favorite?

16
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,369
- Well, I suppose,

17
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,606
that would be me.

18
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,307
- Seriously, Mom.

19
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,575
- Well, honey, I don't know.

20
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:28,113
I can't afford them so I
don't bother with that.

21
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,984
- Why'd you become a nurse then?

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,020
- Stability.

23
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,725
Income, you know.

24
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,762
Helping people. (chuckles)

25
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,664
Who knows?

26
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,034
- Maybe you could do both.

27
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,970
- Ah, I think it's
too late for that.

28
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,240
- It's never too late.

29
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,910
- That is true

30
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:01,180
but I'm really good
with what I do.

31
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,449
- Right.

32
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,323
When are you gonna
use that handbag?

33
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,795
- I'll use that for
a special occasion.

34
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,697
- [Nate] Like what?

35
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,334
- Like Steven's commencement.

36
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,405
- [Nate] You should
just use it every day.

37
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,678
- No, it's too expensive.

38
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,647
Precious.

39
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:43,322
- [Voice-over] After Mom's funeral,
everything went downhill.

40
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,775
- [Larry] Hey.
- [Steven] Hey, Uncle Larry.

41
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:10,942
- Hey, Steven.

42
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:11,843
I thought you boys
would be hungry.

43
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,245
- Oh, thank you.

44
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,327
(groans)

45
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,897
- [Steven] Uncle
Larry brought dinner.

46
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,298
- Is he here?

47
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,133
- [Steven] Yeah.

48
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,637
- I don't know.

49
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,539
- [Steven] Are you hungry?

50
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,441
- No.

51
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,944
- [Steven] No worries, then.

52
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,012
- Thanks.

53
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,726
- [Larry] Well, you're gonna
be a doctor, aren't you?

54
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,627
- (chuckles) Hope so.

55
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,530
- [Larry] Then maybe
your brother will follow.

56
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,732
- Follow?

57
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,400
- [Larry] Yeah, and
finish his studies.

58
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,668
- He did already.

59
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,503
- [Larry] He did?

60
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,172
- Yeah, two years ago.

61
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,774
- I thought that
he moved back home.

62
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:19,444
- He did just because he didn't
want Mom to be by herself.

63
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,482
- So, he would drive two
hours to college every day?

64
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,584
- An hour 45 if
you drive like him.

65
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,186
- [Larry] (laughs) Yeah.

66
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,855
Sorry, I didn't know.

67
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,156
- It's alright,

68
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,958
he doesn't really advertise
his life too much.

69
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,117
You need to eat.

70
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,221
I know you didn't eat lunch.

71
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,227
- [Nate] What's for dinner?

72
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,096
- Pasta.

73
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,567
- [Nate] I'll get to it,
just leave it on the table.

74
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,104
- OK.

75
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,775
(running water)

76
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,285
(whimpering)

77
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,368
(electronic music)

78
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,704
- [Steven] Hey,
is Herman around?

79
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,972
- He is I.

80
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,675
- Hi, I'm Nate's
brother, Steven.

81
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,677
- My condolences.

82
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,845
- Thank you.

83
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,646
- How's Nate doin'?

84
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,881
- Not too well.

85
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,283
I think he just needs time.

86
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,886
- Totally understand.

87
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,122
- I hope this doesn't inconvenience
your business too much.

88
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,990
- No, it does not.

89
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,426
Trent has volunteered to
take all of his clients.

90
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:48,299
- Oh, that's very kind of him.

91
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,905
- [Trent] Hi.

92
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,440
- Hi, you're Trent?

93
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,675
- Yeah, and you're Steven.

94
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:58,877
- I am.

95
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,445
I think I saw you
at the funeral.

96
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,949
- Yeah, I'm really
sorry for your loss.

97
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,750
- [Steven] Thank you.

98
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,918
- How's Nate?

99
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,753
- [Steven] Not too well.

100
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,989
- Oh, I'm sorry.

101
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,991
He really loved his mom.

102
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,927
- She was well-loved
by the family.

103
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,896
- Of course, yeah.

104
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,030
- Hey, thanks, Trent.

105
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,632
- No, any time.

106
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,767
- Give Nate my regards.

107
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,068
- [Trent] Definitely.

108
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,136
- [Woman] OK, bye.

109
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,905
- [Trent] OK, bye.

110
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,107
Sorry.

111
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,275
- It's OK.

112
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,409
Thanks for taking
Nate's clients.

113
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,178
- [Trent] Oh, no problem at all.

114
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,180
- Herman told me you
weren't getting paid for it.

115
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,581
- It's fine.

116
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,584
A little something for
Nate during his tough time.

117
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,385
- [Steven] That's too kind.

118
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,252
I insist you get paid.

119
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,754
- No, I don't want it.

120
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:47,158
Besides, Nate knows that I'll
never take a cent from him.

121
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,661
- Of course.

122
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,131
- When's a good time
to drop by and see him?

123
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,367
- [Steven] He's not really too
keen on visitors right now.

124
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,604
- OK,

125
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,441
I'll just drop him a text then.

126
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,843
- That's very thoughtful.

127
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:39,043
- [Steven] Hey.

128
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,515
- Don't go.

129
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,929
Please don't go back yet.

130
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,065
- I already booked a flight.

131
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,767
- Can't you call and change it?

132
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,636
- It's an internet ticket.

133
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,341
I left it open for now.

134
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,444
(chuckles) Yes,
they let me do that.

135
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,382
I miss you too, Babe.

136
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,284
I love you too.

137
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,965
You're up.

138
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,833
- Yeah.

139
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,468
- You hungry?

140
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,704
- No.

141
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,942
- You should eat though.

142
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,343
- I know, I will.

143
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,508
Do you see that handbag there?

144
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,444
- Yeah.

145
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,448
- [Nate] Mom was gonna use
it for your commencement.

146
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,295
(sniveling)

147
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,162
- There's something
I need to tell you.

148
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,697
- [Nate] Yeah?

149
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,832
- I have a boyfriend.

150
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,334
- Oh, great.

151
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,136
- [Steven] He's super nice.

152
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,471
- That's good.

153
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,941
- So, I told him that I was
staying longer over here

154
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,811
so, he's flying over.

155
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,113
- What for?

156
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,548
- [Steven] Emotional support.

157
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,950
He's nice like that.

158
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,354
- Doesn't he have to work?

159
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,222
- [Steven] Nah, he's
a student as well.

160
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,223
- Med student?

161
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,059
- No, he's getting his PhD.

162
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,660
- [Nate] Smart guy.

163
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,995
- He is.

164
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,496
So, I don't know if
we'll get a hotel

165
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,166
or if I should
have him stay here.

166
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,700
- [Nate] He could sleep
in the living room.

167
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:53,471
- Nate, you know I'm gonna
have to share a bed with him.

168
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,339
- Right.

169
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,378
- [Steven] So,
what do you think?

170
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,279
- Is he rich?

171
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,147
- [Steven] No.

172
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,516
- What do you suggest?

173
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:10,621
- Would it bother you if
we stayed in Mom's room?

174
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,424
- Why would I mind?

175
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,793
- 'Cause you're
emotional like that.

176
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,696
- [Nate] But I'm
not unreasonable.

177
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,798
- Well, then it's settled.

178
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,067
- Yes, it is.

179
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,570
- [Steven] You'll like him.

180
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,438
- I'm sure I will but

181
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,508
I'm not exactly in the
mood to make new friends.

182
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,668
- [Steven] Follow me.

183
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,274
Ray, this is Nate.

184
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,642
- Hi, I'm Ray.
- [Nate] Hi.

185
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,711
- Steven talks about
you all the time.

186
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,612
- [Nate] He does?

187
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,980
- Yeah.

188
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,048
- [Steven] Let's get
that luggage in the room.

189
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,785
Thirsty, Babe?

190
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,921
- [Ray] I'm good, thanks.

191
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,391
- So, I heard you're
getting your PhD.

192
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,625
- I am.

193
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,394
- In what field, if you
don't mind me asking?

194
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,795
- Astrophysics.

195
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,197
- How's that going?

196
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,899
- You know, ups and
downs but moving along.

197
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,100
- I see.

198
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,937
- Ray's studying black holes.

199
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,004
- Really?

200
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,680
(flushing toilet)

201
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,749
(running water)

202
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,579
This is a picture
I took of Steven

203
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,917
during our last hiking trip.

204
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,523
After Steven left for college,

205
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:49,427
we never got a chance
to go hiking again.

206
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:57,034
So, I printed it out, framed
it, and set it on my desk.

207
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,806
Of course Mom and Dad

208
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:09,513
thought I was just a
sweet little brother.

209
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,152
Steven and I had
always been close

210
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,354
and shared a bedroom.

211
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:22,460
When I was 11 and he was 12,

212
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:27,198
we started to experiment
with each other sexually.

213
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,903
After a few years,
we had realized

214
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,473
we'd fallen in love.

215
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,442
Of course, we felt
guilty and ashamed

216
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:43,147
and we didn't dare tell
anybody what we were doing.

217
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:50,921
We'd hoped it was a
phase we'd grow out of.

218
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,426
But we ended up
sleeping with each other

219
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:58,596
until Steven left for college.

220
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,132
We knew this could
destroy our lives

221
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,134
so we made a pact.

222
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,369
- I'll be in Maryland

223
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,438
and you'll go to college
in a different state.

224
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,952
- When's the last night
you'll sleep in my bed?

225
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,922
- [Steven] The night
before I fly off.

226
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,758
- OK.

227
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,562
- You'll be leaving
for college soon.

228
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,697
- Gonna miss you so much.

229
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,132
- [Steven] I'll miss you too.

230
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,902
- You're moving
to a diverse city.

231
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,037
- Your mom and I
want you to know

232
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,071
that if you fall in love...

233
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,339
- Bae.

234
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,808
- It doesn't matter to
us whether that person

235
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,612
is black, white, Asian,
Latino, whatever.

236
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:52,816
- As long as that person
loves you completely.

237
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,923
- Excited about college?

238
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,191
- [Steven] A little bit.

239
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,060
- That's great.

240
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,263
- No, it's not.

241
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,934
Out with it, Nate.

242
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,471
- Fine.

243
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:17,374
Why are you so nonchalant
about the whole thing?

244
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,477
- (chuckles) I am far from it.

245
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:23,113
- You seem to be taking
this transition pretty well.

246
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,249
- So are you.

247
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:29,753
- Not now, am I?

248
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,327
- Can you feel it?

249
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:43,801
I hate this just
as much as you do.

250
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,574
Now, what would you have us do?

251
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,613
- Move to a town far far away.

252
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:58,916
- And cut ties with Mom and Dad?

253
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,951
- Of course not.

254
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,321
- OK, what then?

255
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,761
- We'll stick to the plan.

256
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,963
- You sure?

257
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,166
- Is there a choice?

258
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,568
- No, not really.

259
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,785
- [Voice-over] My grades
went down after Steven left.

260
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:40,391
Didn't help that we agreed
not to text each other.

261
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,828
The night before Thanksgiving
I could not sleep.

262
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,180
- [Mom] Steven?

263
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,149
Oh, great.

264
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,650
- Hi, Ma.

265
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:11,889
- Come on in, let
me get your bag.

266
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,091
- [Steven] I got it, it's heavy.

267
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:14,992
Hey, Nate.

268
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,126
- Good to see you, Steven.

269
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,695
- [Steven] Good to be back.

270
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,263
When's Dad comin' back?

271
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,964
- About an hour or so.

272
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,900
- [Steven] OK.

273
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,105
I think I might go
with a Japanese car

274
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,040
because they last longer.

275
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,308
- Oh, is that so?

276
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,911
- [Steven] People say that.

277
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,913
- Japanese or American
doesn't matter.

278
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,582
Just make sure you get the car
inspected before you buy it.

279
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,150
- I know.

280
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,920
- [Mom] Maybe Steven
should just take the bus.

281
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:46,190
- He needs a car for
social activities.

282
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,726
- [Mom] He needs to
focus on his studies.

283
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,461
- I am, Mom.

284
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,768
- That was not scary at all.

285
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,004
- Apparently, Nate fell asleep.

286
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,040
- I'm just tired.

287
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,775
- Your dad was scared.

288
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,043
- Pardon me?

289
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:09,279
- I saw you closing your
eyes and covering them.

290
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:17,281
- It's late.

291
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:22,526
- Here, I'll get it.

292
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,762
- [Mom] No, no, no, no, no.

293
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,864
It's after midnight for you.

294
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:27,931
- Thanks, Mom.

295
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,813
- Honey, turn off the
lights before you go to bed.

296
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:50,454
- OK.

297
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,395
(sighs) Nate.

298
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,230
- Yes?

299
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,399
- Go to bed.

300
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,768
- I will, don't worry.

301
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:44,575
(flushing toilet)

302
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,643
(running water)

303
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:08,959
- [Nate] I miss you.

304
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,710
- I miss you too.

305
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:43,727
- Good afternoon.

306
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,028
- [Nate] Afternoon.

307
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,630
- We left breakfast
for you in the fridge.

308
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,698
- Thank you.

309
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:42,319
- Hey.

310
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,355
- Did you sleep well?

311
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,023
- It was alright.

312
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,324
How 'bout you?

313
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:50,327
- Took me a while but I did it.

314
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,530
- Good.

315
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,699
- So, did you get
any on the sheets?

316
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,134
- Excuse me?

317
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,668
- Your come or his come?

318
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,737
- [Steven] What the fuck?

319
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,472
- You guys were
fucking, weren't you?

320
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,541
- Yes, I missed him.

321
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,176
- I don't know how I
feel about you guys

322
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,611
fucking on Mom's bed.

323
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,646
- Mom wanted us to be happy.

324
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:13,417
- Her bed is not
even five days cold.

325
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,887
- We're getting a hotel.

326
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,839
- [Ray] What's going on?

327
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,240
- [Steven] Close the door.

328
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:12,008
We're gonna check in.

329
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,377
I'll come back.

330
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,180
(sniffling)

331
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,883
- Where did Mom and Dad go?

332
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,021
- I don't know.

333
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,861
- Do you think there
might be an afterlife?

334
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:42,666
- You know I'm an atheist
and I know you are too.

335
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,267
- You never was.

336
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,535
- Agnostic.

337
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,404
- I suppose.

338
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,140
- And you suppose
there's an afterlife

339
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,943
for all the plants
and animals too?

340
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,112
- I don't know.

341
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,317
- Like Christopher
Hitchens said,

342
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,752
"We can't lie to ourselves
that we're any more important

343
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,822
than any other living creature."

344
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:07,824
- You worship him.

345
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:11,194
- (chuckles) He
makes a lot of sense.

346
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:16,700
- I'm not fully convinced.

347
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,902
- What about the fact
that the Universe,

348
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:23,840
vast as it is, only has one
known planet to support life?

349
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,742
This goes against the notion
that there is a creator

350
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,944
because, if there was one,

351
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,546
he certainly did not
do a very good job

352
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:32,983
fine tuning the Universe.

353
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:40,757
- Yeah, well, Christopher
Hitchens is dead.

354
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,042
I want to see Mom and Dad again.

355
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,978
- Me too.

356
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,418
- Do you think we will?

357
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:12,088
- I wish I could say, "we will."

358
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,239
We're not leaving.

359
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:32,575
- (laughs) I figured.

360
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,811
- You're too smart for me.

361
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,181
- Hardly, you're
just too patient.

362
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,317
- I'm so sorry.

363
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,086
- It's OK.

364
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,789
You get a free pass.

365
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,857
- How did I get so lucky?

366
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,906
- [Voice-over] It's been
hard without Dad and Mom.

367
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,210
Their absence has
caused a black hole

368
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:13,483
which seems to be sucking
the life out of me.

369
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,056
I remember the
mornings before school.

370
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:20,824
- Bye, Mom.

371
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:25,995
- [Mom] Bye.

372
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,201
- Bye, Mom.

373
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,602
- [Mom] Bye, Honey.

374
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,116
- Dad.

375
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,817
- Yes?

376
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:52,455
- I understand how all the
forces add up to zero now.

377
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:53,857
- Good.

378
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,558
Go to sleep.

379
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,361
You need a sharp
mind for tomorrow.

380
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:01,798
- I'm gonna read over some
more stuff before bed.

381
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,799
- Really?

382
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:03,967
Now?

383
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:08,705
- Yes.

384
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,778
Can I ask you another question?

385
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,312
- Sure.

386
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,350
- How do you manage
to stay up so late

387
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:23,787
and get up so early
every morning to work?

388
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:28,258
- Son, when you find
a job that you love,

389
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,162
you will never work
a day in your life.

390
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,950
- You should sleep already.

391
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,119
- Just want to make sure
I remember everything.

392
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,221
- You will.

393
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,692
- It's important.

394
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:07,897
The following month Dad was
diagnosed with stomach cancer.

395
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:15,405
(sniffles)
He died two years later.

396
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:19,442
The doctors said he
put up a good fight,

397
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,078
lived longer than
they ever expected.

398
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:25,815
Mom?

399
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,450
- Yeah?

400
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,186
- I need to tell you something.

401
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,821
- Sure.

402
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,893
- Can you sit down?

403
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,896
- Sure.

404
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:47,670
OK, I'm all ears.

405
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,344
- I'm not straight.

406
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:58,147
- Oh, Honey, that's OK.

407
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:04,087
- [Nate] Really?
- Yes.

408
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,991
- I never got the
chance to tell Dad.

409
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:12,795
- Oh, Honey, your Dad would
not have cared either way.

410
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:16,900
He loved you so much.

411
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:22,338
It only matters that you
find somebody to love.

412
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,374
- Thanks, Mom.

413
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,847
- Is there?

414
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,583
- Is there what?

415
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:36,185
- [Mom] Someone special?

416
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,288
- No.

417
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,358
- Good, 'cause you're too young.

418
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:10,620
(sniveling)

419
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,525
- It's OK.

420
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:17,560
It's OK, I'm here.
(weeping)

421
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,495
I'm here.

422
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,501
It's OK, Bae.

423
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,608
- What if Mom and Dad know?

424
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,710
- How would they?

425
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,511
- What if they're
in Heaven watching?

426
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,347
- Nate.

427
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,049
- They'll be so ashamed of us.

428
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,719
- There is no Heaven.

429
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,954
- What if there is?

430
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,590
- Don't be silly.

431
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,930
Relax.

432
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:55,832
Go to sleep.

433
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,336
- Can you please hold
me until I fall asleep?

434
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:03,506
- Are you going to sleep soon?

435
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,141
- I don't know.

436
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,878
- I don't know if I can.

437
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:12,248
- You could just slip out
as soon as I fall asleep.

438
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,984
- Ray's still awake.

439
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,653
- Please.

440
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:20,123
- It's not a good idea.

441
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:27,263
- (sighs) OK.

442
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:33,102
Thanks for not leaving just yet.

443
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:35,938
- You don't need to say that.

444
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,746
(sniffling)

445
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:46,616
- You're right, you should go.

446
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:49,018
Don't keep Ray waiting.

447
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,887
- Are you sure?

448
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,824
- Yeah.

449
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,460
- OK.

450
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,109
- Thank you.

451
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,911
- You're welcome.

452
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:18,347
- Do you want to go
get your brother?

453
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,682
- [Steven] No, he's
still sleeping.

454
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:20,483
- Are you sure?

455
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:21,317
- [Steven] Yeah.

456
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:22,385
- It's lunch time.

457
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,853
- [Steven] I know.

458
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,855
- Is it possible for someone
to sleep more than 12 hours?

459
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,417
- [Steven] If he only
sleeps part of it.

460
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,258
- [Voice-over] Like
most brothers,

461
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,994
Steven and I disagreed a lot

462
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:10,500
but never to a point where we
couldn't get back together.

463
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,239
- What's wrong with
doing your pre-med here?

464
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,775
It's just pre-med anyway.

465
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:21,644
- 'Cause my chances of getting
into med school are higher

466
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:25,114
if I do my pre-med
at a good college.

467
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,850
- He'll come visit
during the holidays.

468
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:30,019
- [Nate] You do realize

469
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:31,254
that Dad's prognosis
is a year, right?

470
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,222
- Yes, Nate, I'm
very aware of that.

471
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,657
- [Nate] Well, don't
you want to be here?

472
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,626
- Kids,

473
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:43,699
your dad just wants
you to live your lives.

474
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,405
- Let's eat dinner.

475
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,985
- Nate loves you to death.

476
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:06,055
- (chuckles) Literally.

477
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:09,458
- Exactly. (chuckles)

478
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:18,067
Look.

479
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,040
- [Dad] They finally
stopped fighting.

480
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,088
- I think my perversion
has reached a new level.

481
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,257
- Why do you say that?

482
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:47,597
- I'm using Dad's
cancer to keep you here.

483
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,032
- Nate.

484
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,901
- Yeah?

485
00:47:51,903 --> 00:47:53,936
- I love you.

486
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,240
- Will you always love me?

487
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:59,242
- Of course.

488
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,145
- Even after you find someone?

489
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:06,515
- Regardless.

490
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:13,589
- You will find someone,
you know that, right?

491
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,093
- I don't.

492
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:23,666
- It's college,
everybody's looking.

493
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:31,340
- We should go back inside
before they suspect something.

494
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,010
- OK.

495
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:39,315
Will you sleep in
my bed tonight?

496
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:45,354
- Of course.

497
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:50,826
(knocking)

498
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,382
- [Steven] Hey, Trent.

499
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,718
- Yeah, how are
you doing, Steven?

500
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,786
- [Steven] Gettin' by.

501
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:19,088
Come on in.
- [Trent] Thanks.

502
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:25,895
- I'll get Nate for ya.

503
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,601
- Is Jessica's knee still
givin' her problems?

504
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:33,869
- Yes.

505
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:37,640
I've taken her off
squats and lunges.

506
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,674
- She loves 'em though.

507
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,510
- (chuckles) She totally does.

508
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,980
She loves the pain.

509
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,516
- Thank you for helping me out.

510
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:48,551
I should be back soon.

511
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:50,186
- Don't worry about it.

512
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:53,389
Just take all the
time that you need.

513
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,725
- Thank you.

514
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:58,094
- So, your brother's
still in town?

515
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:59,462
- Yes.

516
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:02,698
- Who's the other guy, huh?

517
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,634
- His boyfriend.

518
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:06,702
- They make a cute couple.

519
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,990
- Everything OK?

520
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:29,859
- Yeah.

521
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,862
- Looks like something's
goin' on there.

522
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,064
- Looks like it.

523
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,766
- That's a good thing, right?

524
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:43,906
- Yes, definitely.

525
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:51,247
- [Nate] Trent.

526
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,783
- Yes?

527
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:57,253
- [Nate] You are an amazing guy.

528
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,287
- No.

529
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,156
- You are.

530
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:05,327
You deserve a really good guy.

531
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,898
- [Trent] You think so?

532
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,866
- Yes.

533
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:15,471
Do you find any of
the new trainers hot?

534
00:51:15,473 --> 00:51:17,373
- Yes.

535
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,877
- [Nate] Do you flirt
with any of them?

536
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:24,880
- You know the
answer to that, Nate.

537
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,749
Stop playing games, OK?

538
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,917
- [Nate] I'm not playing games.

539
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,386
- What is this, then?

540
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,491
- I know we had sex.

541
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:39,628
- I know, I was there.

542
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:43,032
- Trent, it meant a lot to me.

543
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:44,733
- Really?

544
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,735
- Yeah.

545
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,137
- But you drew back.

546
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,697
There's no one here.

547
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,699
- I can't.

548
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:19,935
- You want to go
back to my place?

549
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:23,405
- I can't.

550
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,712
- You can't?

551
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:31,580
- No.

552
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,585
- OK.

553
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:44,393
- I'm sorry.

554
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,499
- You have to give
me more than that.

555
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,903
OK, what's going on?

556
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,241
I love you, Nate.

557
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,342
- Oh, Trent, please
don't say that.

558
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,944
- Why not?

559
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:02,945
It's true.

560
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:08,717
- Because I can't say it back.

561
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:15,958
- How long you gonna
make me wait for it?

562
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:21,463
- I don't know.

563
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,937
- What's goin' on?

564
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:33,309
(sighs)

565
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,011
- Trent, I'm conflicted.

566
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:41,584
- You're conflicted.

567
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:51,293
- My heart wants one thing
and my mind wants another.

568
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,601
- Is there someone else?

569
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,039
- I never see him.

570
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,308
He lives out of state.

571
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,613
- Where is he?

572
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:13,449
- Maryland.

573
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:17,853
- Why didn't you
tell me about him?

574
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:24,326
- I am really sorry.

575
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:29,131
- (laughs) You're really sorry?

576
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,000
- Trent.

577
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,238
(laughs)

578
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:44,346
- I am such an idiot, right?

579
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:50,986
I'll lock the gate.

580
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:54,156
Can you activate the alarm?

581
00:54:54,158 --> 00:55:00,262
- OK.

582
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:07,269
- You still in
love with that guy?

583
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,706
- Yes.

584
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:15,978
- You guy's together?

585
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,580
- No.

586
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,354
- Who is he?

587
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,823
- I can't tell you.

588
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,825
- Why?

589
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,328
- I can't say but please
know that it's killing me.

590
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,431
- It's killing me too.

591
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:37,866
- I'm so sorry.

592
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,805
- I'll still do
anything for you.

593
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:47,376
That's how stupid I am.

594
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,613
- I know I'll commit
murder for you.

595
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:56,685
- (chuckles) Well,
that makes me happy.

596
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,555
- I'm serious.

597
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,325
- I know.

598
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:22,144
(Trent sighs)

599
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:30,419
- I'm glad you came.

600
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:35,891
- Me too.

601
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:56,912
What's on your mind?

602
00:56:58,149 --> 00:57:00,616
- My parents.

603
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,751
- I'm sorry.

604
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:06,889
- It's good memories.

605
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:12,795
- They were pretty
awesome, weren't they?

606
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,930
- Yes.

607
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,001
I miss them.

608
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:25,340
- I'm sorry.

609
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,278
- Thank you.

610
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,625
(running water)

611
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:02,044
What's wrong?

612
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:04,480
- I know you're
grieving and so am I

613
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:08,183
but you need to start
cleaning up after yourself.

614
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,485
- That's what this is about?

615
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:10,486
- Yes.

616
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:11,920
- [Nate] Really?

617
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:15,924
- Yeah, there's a fine line
between depression and laziness.

618
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,097
Good night.

619
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,165
- G'night.

620
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:02,404
Go away.

621
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:03,805
- [Steven] Nate.

622
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,842
- [Nate] I'm not
being lazy, I swear.

623
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,013
- I know.

624
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,382
I overreacted.

625
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:19,121
Can you face me, please?

626
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,928
Can't sleep?

627
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:29,197
Maybe if you turned the
lights off that would help.

628
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,533
- Makes it worse.

629
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,970
- OK.

630
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:37,439
Come here.

631
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:52,788
- Come back to me.

632
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,957
- Nate, we agreed about this.

633
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:56,625
- But Mom and Dad are gone now.

634
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,727
- But we still have
relatives to face.

635
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,395
Uncle Larry, Susie.

636
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:01,563
- Who cares about them?

637
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:03,765
- And what about our friends?

638
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,100
- I don't care.

639
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,970
- You're not thinking properly.

640
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,040
- I've never stopped
loving you, Steven.

641
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,843
- And I never
stopped loving you.

642
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,713
- Seems like you
moved on though.

643
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:20,048
- Ray?

644
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,850
Nate, we're capable of
loving more than one person

645
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,885
in our life.

646
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:24,820
One day you'll have someone else

647
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:27,689
and I'll be the one jealous.

648
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:30,859
- Are you jealous of Trent?

649
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,061
- Should I be?

650
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:34,896
- We fucked.

651
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:37,933
- Great.

652
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:15,604
(heavy breathing)

653
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,284
Lube?

654
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:03,351
- Same place.

655
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,241
(deep panting)

656
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:57,599
(moaning)

657
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:25,627
- Do you want milk, Babe?

658
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:26,695
- No thanks.

659
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:47,282
- So, any interesting news?

660
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:48,350
- Not really.

661
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:07,869
I think that's the
earliest I've seen him up.

662
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:09,437
- Nah, he might go back to bed.

663
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:43,638
- Good morning.

664
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,274
- Up already?

665
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,176
- Yes.

666
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,244
- Good morning.

667
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:51,479
- Good morning, how are you?

668
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,548
- Good, thanks for asking.

669
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,183
How are you?

670
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:56,351
- [Nate] Sleepy.

671
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:57,519
- [Steven] You want
to go back to bed?

672
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,721
- [Nate] I think I'm fine.

673
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:03,291
- [Ray] What's your
plan for today?

674
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,559
- Clean up the house.

675
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:05,927
- I said it was fine.

676
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:08,196
- No, I insist.

677
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,597
- [Ray] Babe, did you want
to show me the sandwich shop

678
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,933
you went to as a kid?

679
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:12,734
- He is a kid.

680
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:14,402
- (chuckles) Shut up.

681
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:15,971
- A big kid.

682
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,572
- [Steven] Yes, of course.

683
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,574
- I look forward to it.

684
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,579
- Sorry.

685
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,680
- [Ray] It's OK.

686
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,849
- Should we go at noon?

687
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:34,923
- Sounds good.

688
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,029
I ate so much.

689
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:42,364
I need to go to the bathroom.

690
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,599
- Go ahead.
- Excuse me.

691
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,101
- So, how was it?

692
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:46,835
- It never changes.

693
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:49,237
- I told you so.

694
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:54,542
- [Steven] (sighs) Miss you.

695
01:06:58,482 --> 01:07:00,849
Nate, not here.

696
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:01,983
- Want to go to our room?

697
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,284
- No.

698
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:04,219
- Just cuddle?

699
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:05,820
- Nate, I really shouldn't.

700
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,155
- Why not?

701
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,357
- Because of Ray.

702
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,129
I'm sorry.

703
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,463
- You're sorry?

704
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:17,432
- Yes.

705
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,434
- About what?

706
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:22,070
- (sighs) About this.

707
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:23,905
About last night.

708
01:07:24,975 --> 01:07:27,909
- You're sorry about last night?

709
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,745
- Yes.

710
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,616
- I'm not sorry.

711
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:37,886
- You know what I mean.

712
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,755
- I do

713
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,191
but I honestly don't
know how much longer

714
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:45,326
I can bear it anymore.

715
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:46,895
- What do you mean by that?

716
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,315
- [Ray] What did I miss?

717
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,716
- Miss?

718
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:09,617
- That's what he said.

719
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,553
- I was just clarifying.

720
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:13,621
- Have a seat.

721
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,327
I'll tell you what you missed.

722
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:20,228
- Sure.

723
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,797
- Why don't you, Nate?

724
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:24,799
- Go ahead.

725
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,747
- What did he miss?

726
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:43,518
- I, uh, can't recall.

727
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:47,055
- For some reason,
I can't either.

728
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:48,957
- Did you two just get
amnesia or something?

729
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:52,293
- When we get together
we just talk randomly.

730
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,396
- You can't remember what
you just talked about?

731
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:57,699
- Do you have a brother?

732
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:59,267
- No.

733
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:01,369
- Well, let me tell you this:

734
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,338
When you have a brother,
close to your age

735
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,206
and you grow up together,

736
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:08,042
he becomes the wall
at which you bounce

737
01:09:08,044 --> 01:09:10,211
your racquetballs off.

738
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:11,146
- I hear what
you're sayin', Nate,

739
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:14,082
but I'm not sure if Ray does.

740
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:16,451
- I think I do.

741
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:20,188
- It's someone you can
challenge and be challenged by.

742
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,790
It's a boy thing.

743
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:24,359
Two boys challenging each other

744
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:26,528
but in a good way.

745
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,563
- Sounds good.

746
01:09:58,662 --> 01:09:59,727
(knocking)

747
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:34,262
(Steven sighs)

748
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:52,413
- [Steven] Sometimes I
wish we weren't brothers.

749
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,917
- I don't.

750
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,386
- We could be together.

751
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:05,526
- But how would I have
survived elementary,

752
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:08,229
middle and high school?

753
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:10,965
- I'm sure you
would've been fine.

754
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:16,704
- Wouldn't have had anyone to
defend me against the bullies.

755
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,706
- You were fierce
in high school.

756
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:21,809
You defended me
from the bullies.

757
01:11:25,548 --> 01:11:28,316
- They weren't bullies.

758
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:30,585
- They were bitches.

759
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,054
- Exactly.

760
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:07,288
- [Ray] Thanks for having me.

761
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:10,491
- [Nate] Take care
of Steven for me.

762
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:16,698
- You bet.

763
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,637
- I'll call you when we land.

764
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:23,738
- OK.

765
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,406
- Bye.

766
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:27,241
- Safe travels.

767
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:31,179
- Hey, Babe, can you
give me a minute?

768
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:33,014
- Shuttle's here.

769
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:36,718
- I know, can you load
my luggage please?

770
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,486
- OK.

771
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:39,554
- Thanks.

772
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:06,247
(Nate snivels)

773
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,950
- [Nate] I can't
live without you.

774
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:13,221
- I'm just a phone call away.

775
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,758
- I miss you.

776
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:19,894
- I've always missed you.

777
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:23,231
- Babe.

778
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:25,833
- I'll be right there.

779
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:27,735
- OK.

780
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,903
Goodbye, Nate.

781
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,372
- Bye.

782
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,944
- I should go.

783
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:39,814
- OK.

784
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:07,208
- [Voice-over] Steven
called me later that day.

785
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,178
He told Ray everything

786
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,481
but Ray was not surprised.

787
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,417
Ray went on to say that

788
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,653
he would accept Steven's
past on condition

789
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:22,457
that Steven would not be
intimate with me again.

790
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:25,460
Needless to say,

791
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:29,831
Steven told me that we
absolutely needed to move on.

792
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,666
- Goodbye.

793
01:15:39,469 --> 01:15:40,535
(deep sigh)

794
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:04,825
(electronic music)

795
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:11,899
- Nine.

796
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:18,573
Eight.

797
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,145
- Hey, Nate.

798
01:16:24,147 --> 01:16:26,280
- Hey, Jess.
(laughs)

799
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:27,214
You're early.

800
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,016
- Well, you know, it happens.

801
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,151
I'm excited to see you.

802
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:31,052
- Thank you.

803
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:35,189
- Give me a hug. (laughs)

804
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:40,695
- [Trent] Leaving?

805
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:43,364
- Yeah, my last client canceled.

806
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:47,134
- Oh, I was going to
ask you if you wanted

807
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:49,837
to get dinner or something.

808
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:53,140
- You're not done yet, are you?

809
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:57,211
- I can cancel.

810
01:16:57,213 --> 01:17:00,448
- No, you shouldn't do that.

811
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,516
- That's true.

812
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,887
How are you?

813
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,058
- I'm OK.

814
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,360
(chuckles)

815
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:14,028
- So, after I left you,

816
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:17,698
I went and got my favorite
dish in the whole world.

817
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:20,801
Yes, it's meatloaf
from the same place.

818
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,870
I know you're sick of it.

819
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:36,751
You must be wondering why
I've e-mailed you a video

820
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:41,088
telling you my deepest,
darkest secret.

821
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:51,666
Life has no purpose for me now.

822
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:59,206
Please forgive me. (sniffles)

823
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,752
I love you.

824
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:42,650
(knocking)

825
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:14,949
(knocking)

826
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:36,804
- I was just in
the neighborhood.

827
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:40,841
You OK?
