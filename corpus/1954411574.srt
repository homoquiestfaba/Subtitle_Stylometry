14
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,623
- WHO DOESN'T LOVE
THANKSGIVING BREAK?

15
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,758
ME, TORI GILLESPIE.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,729
OR, AS EVERYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL
USED TO CALL ME...

17
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,198
all: WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE!

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,867
- THAT NICKNAME WAS MEANT
TO BE IRONIC, BY THE WAY,

19
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,437
ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE SEX
WITH A ZUCCHINI ONCE,

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,906
SO I GUESS THAT WAS
KIND OF SLUTTY.

21
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,875
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
HIGH SCHOOL FUCKING SUCKED.

22
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,111
BUT HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL:

23
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:21,280
IT ENDS.

24
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,315
AND YOU GET TO GO TO COLLEGE,

25
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,251
WHERE NO ONE KNOWS THAT YOU
WERE A BED-WETTER TILL 14,

26
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,521
OR THAT YOU BROKE YOUR OWN HYMEN
WITH A BABY CARROT.

27
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,391
ONLY PROBLEM IS,
WHEN THE HOLIDAYS ROLL AROUND,

28
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:36,328
YOU STILL HAVE TO GO HOME.

29
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:46,271
¶ ¶

30
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,540
- HI!

31
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,642
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

32
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,614
- THE ALLEGHANY
RAILROAD AUTHORITY

33
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,683
WELCOMES YOU TO PITTSBURGH.

34
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,985
YOUR TRAIN FROM NEW YORK...

35
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,421
- I TEXTED YOU
ON MY NEW PHONE!

36
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,524
- LOOK AT MY SIGN!

37
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,460
- WANT TO SWITCH LIVES?

38
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,497
- I'D RATHER EAT MY OWN SHIT.

39
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,731
AND I DO!

40
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,933
THIS IS SHIT UP IN HERE.

41
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,568
- AND YET I'M STILL
JEALOUS OF YOU.

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,936
- WHERE IS SHE?

43
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,005
YAY!

44
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,843
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HOME.

45
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,545
- YEP, IT'S STILL YOU!

46
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,880
- UNFORTUNATELY.

47
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,515
- I CAN'T WAIT
TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT

48
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,617
GOSSIPING ABOUT
NORTHWESTERN BOYS.

49
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,851
- OR GIRLS.
WE DON'T JUDGE.

50
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:33,886
JUST DON'T TALK DETAILS.

51
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,120
IT GIVES YOUR MOTHER NIGHTMARES.

52
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,421
- NIGHTMARES,
IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES.

53
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,090
- ALSO, I HAVE SOME HUGE NEWS.

54
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,325
- WHAT, MY TRAIN CRASHED AND
I'M ACTUALLY IN HELL RIGHT NOW?

55
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,327
- GIL AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED!

56
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,731
ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT?

57
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,765
- YEAH, I'M LOOKING AT IT.

58
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,701
- IS IT BEAUTIFUL?

59
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:53,539
- SHIT, THIS IS WHY I'M GLAD
MY FAMILY DEAD.

60
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,212
- SCOTT!

61
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,213
SCOTT!

62
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,214
SCOTT!

63
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,550
FUCKING LOOK AT ME!

64
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,961
- I MISSED YOU
SO MUCH, BOO.

65
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,629
- HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS,

66
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,364
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMEWHERE A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE?

67
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,169
YOU ARE A FUCKING GENIUS!

68
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,681
- I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
MAYBE MORE LIKE MY PLACE.

69
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,417
- SHH, PUBLIC SEX
IS WAY IN RIGHT NOW.

70
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,686
IT'S THE SECOND MOST SEARCHED
TERM ON YOUPORN,

71
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,654
RIGHT UNDER
"BROTHER SISTER STUFF."

72
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,925
SHIT!

73
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,228
HERE, HOLD MY INVISALIGN.

74
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,698
MY GOD.

75
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,199
IT'S A GLORY HOLE.

76
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,568
I'VE ONLY SEEN THESE
IN GAY PORN!

77
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,837
- WHY ARE YOU WATCHING
GAY PORN?

78
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,574
- WEE!

79
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,743
- WHO ARE YOU,
FUCKING SPIDER-MAN?

80
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,144
- GIMME YOUR DICK!

81
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,213
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I REALLY WANT TO.

82
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,648
YOU ODDLY RESEMBLE

83
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,916
THE <i>ALICE IN WONDERLAND</i> CAT
RIGHT NOW.

84
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,517
- STOP BEING SUCH A PUSSY,

85
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,421
AND GIVE ME YOUR DICK.

86
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:32,337
IT'S LIKE THE WALL'S
EATING MY PENIS.

87
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,172
- WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH THESE PEOPLE?

88
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,240
- I KNOW.

89
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,210
SOME MOTHERFUCKERS
ARE SO DISGUSTING.

90
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,281
- DEAR GOD.

91
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,682
HERE IT COMES.

92
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,860
- ARE YOU CRYING?

93
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,295
- I'M SORRY.

94
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,264
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HARD
THIS WAS GONNA BE.

95
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,101
WELL, DO YOU WANT
TO JUST, LIKE...

96
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,437
PARKOUR BACK OVER
AND FINISH ME OFF IN HERE?

97
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,739
NO, NO.

98
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,641
I REALLY WANTED THERE
TO BE A WALL BETWEEN US

99
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,311
WHEN I SAID THIS.

100
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,312
- WHAT ARE YOU--

101
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,513
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

102
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,648
- I'M SORRY, SCOTT.

103
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,650
IT'S OVER.

104
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,120
- WHAT?

105
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:34,299
- OKAY, LIKE, THIS IS
SUPER AWKWARD, BUT...

106
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:38,637
COULD YOU PUT MY INVISALIGN
BACK IN?

107
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,407
SEEWELL HIGH SCHOOL WISHES YOU
A HAPPY THANKSGIVING BREAK.

108
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,408
BE GOOD PEOPLE.

109
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,810
MAKE GOOD CHOICES.

110
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,345
- AND I WAS LIKE,
"THAT'S THE LAST TIME

111
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,581
I'M EVER HAVING SEX
WITH THE CAFETERIA LADY AGAIN."

112
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,717
BYE, GROSS,
STUPID FUCKING BITCH!

113
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,320
KIDDING.
NOT REALLY.

114
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:06,331
¶ ¶

115
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,338
- JANIE, IS THAT YOU?

116
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,573
- JOEL.

117
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,908
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

118
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,243
- NOTHING MUCH.

119
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,079
JUST VISITING
THE OLD STOMPING GROUNDS.

120
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,681
- SO ARE THE RUMORS TRUE?

121
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,884
I HEAR YOU'VE TURNED INTO
QUITE THE PIMP AT CORNELL.

122
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,419
- YOU FOLLOW MY TUMBLR?

123
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,553
- NO.

124
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,654
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.

125
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,022
I POST A LOT OF BLOGS

126
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,792
ABOUT MY WILD ADVENTURES,

127
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,861
OR, AS I TITLED THEM,

128
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,398
"#ASSVENTURES."

129
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,632
SO...

130
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,301
- THAT SOUNDS KIND OF GAY.

131
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,003
- I DISAGREE.

132
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,605
- WELL, WELCOME HOME, JOEL.

133
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,141
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

134
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,609
- HEY, I'M GONNA BE
HELPING YOUR DAD OUT

135
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,010
AT THE VINYL VAULT
THIS WEEKEND,

136
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,545
IF YOU WANT TO STOP BY.

137
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,813
- YEAH, MAYBE.

138
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,248
- YEAH, MAN,
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH

139
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,552
TO BOX UP THAT WHOLE PLACE
BY MONDAY, YOU KNOW?

140
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,020
- WHY ARE YOU BOXING IT UP?

141
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,857
- 'CAUSE YOUR DAD
IS CLOSING IT DOWN,

142
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,459
WHICH I'M GUESSING

143
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,762
HE WANTED TO TELL YOU HIMSELF.

144
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,002
HELL YEAH,
I THINK THAT WENT WELL.

145
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,005
- ¶ OOH, YOU'RE FIXIN'
MY HAIR ¶

146
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:24,976
- I CAN SEE
THAT YOU'VE READ THEM.

147
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,445
- WELL, I SEE COLLEGE
HASN'T ALTERED

148
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,647
YOUR SOPHISTICATED
EATING HABITS ANY.

149
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,148
- NOT NOW, DAD.

150
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,349
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE CHECK OUT

151
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,951
THIS SURREALIST
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBIT

152
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,586
AT THE ART MUSEUM THIS WEEKEND?

153
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,456
- I'D SAY I'M SU-REALLY
NOT IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW.

154
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,924
SO, NO.

155
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,794
- WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

156
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,129
- WHAT THE HELL, DAD?

157
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,364
YOU'RE CLOSING THE STORE?

158
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,232
- WHAT?

159
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,134
THE VAULT'S AN INSTITUTION.

160
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,169
- I WAS GONNA TELL YOU GUYS
ABOUT THAT THIS WEEKEND.

161
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,171
- YET YOU TOLD JOEL
BEFORE US.

162
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,640
- JOEL'S MY BEST EMPLOYEE.

163
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,709
HE'S EASY TO TALK TO.

164
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,277
KIND OF SOOTHING,

165
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,445
LIKE A WOMAN.

166
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,713
- ARE WE BROKE?

167
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,981
- COME ON IN HERE.

168
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,116
SIT DOWN;
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

169
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,921
YES, I'M SELLING THE SHOP.

170
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,389
NO, WE'RE NOT BROKE.

171
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,125
TRUTH IS, THE STORE IS DOING
PRETTY WELL FINANCIALLY.

172
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,328
BUT MOST OF THE BUSINESS
IS FROM COLLECTORS ONLINE,

173
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,632
SO KEEPING THE STORE OPEN
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE.

174
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,502
ALSO, I MET SOMEONE.

175
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,603
- YOU DID?

176
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,271
- ANASTASIA.

177
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,740
- A STRIPPER?

178
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,774
WHAT?

179
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,209
I MEAN, WITH A NAME LIKE THAT,

180
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,111
SHE'S EITHER A DISNEY PRINCESS
OR A TOTAL SLUT.

181
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,347
- COME ON, SHE'S A VINYL
COLLECTOR DOWN IN FLORIDA.

182
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,381
- BOO.

183
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,415
- AND I WAS THINKING

184
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,717
AFTER JANIE GRADUATED
THIS SPRING,

185
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,985
I'D MOVE DOWN THERE WITH HER.

186
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,052
THIS IS PLACE IS GONNA BE

187
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,221
WAY TOO BIG FOR JUST ME,
ANYHOW.

188
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,523
BUT, HEY,

189
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,192
WE HAVE ONE LAST THANKSGIVING
AT HOME BEFORE WE MOVE.

190
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,227
THAT'LL BE FUN, RIGHT?

191
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,271
OKAY.

192
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,506
GOOD TALK.

193
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,875
- AM I DOING IT RIGHT?

194
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,010
- NO!

195
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,578
LOU, POP YOUR ASS!

196
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,781
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MY PARENTS
TURNED MY ROOM INTO A GYM.

197
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,383
- LOU, POP THAT ASS!

198
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,784
WATCH MY ASS POP.

199
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,852
- YOUR ASS IS POPPIN'.

200
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:14,853
- YEAH.

201
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:15,954
- GIRL, IT COULD BE WORSE.

202
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,155
I KNOW A CHICK WHOSE PARENTS

203
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,224
TURNED HER ROOM
INTO A SEX DUNGEON.

204
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,792
- NOT SURE THAT'S WORSE.

205
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,862
POP THAT ASS,
POP THAT ASS, POP THAT ASS.

206
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,196
- GIRL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO OUT TONIGHT,

207
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,731
GET YOUR MIND OFF THINGS?

208
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,167
- THE ONLY WAY THAT
I COULD GET MY MIND OFF THINGS

209
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,537
WOULD BE TO JOIN A CULT AND
GET MYSELF FUCKING BRAINWASHED.

210
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,506
- GIRL, DON'T EVEN PLAY
ABOUT THAT SHIT.

211
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,942
I JOINED A CULT ONCE
BECAUSE THEY HAD RED TRACK SUITS

212
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,144
AND I WANTED
A RED TRACK SUIT.

213
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:42,147
THE AMOUNT OF INNOCENT
I SAW SLAIN...

214
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,683
WAS NOT WORTH
THAT RED TRACK SUIT.

215
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,087
- GOD.

216
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,524
APPARENTLY, THERE IS
A KEGGER ON PLUM STREET

217
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:53,758
BY THE CREEK.

218
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,393
- A KEGGER BY THE CREEK?

219
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,795
TELL ME YOU MADE THAT SHIT UP.

220
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,263
IT SOUNDS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.

221
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,632
- BELIEVE ME,
IT IS ALL TOO REAL.

222
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,500
- WELL, THEN GO, AND TAKE VIDEO.

223
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,537
I WANT TO SEE WHERE
TORI THE WHORIE COMES FROM.

224
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,173
- NO, LOOK, THE WHOLE POINT
OF GOING TO COLLEGE

225
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,108
IS TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL OF THE PEOPLE

226
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,444
THAT YOU HATED IN HIGH SCHOOL.

227
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,079
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO GO BACK TO THAT?

228
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,513
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE
LIKE TAKING A MASSIVE SHIT

229
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,917
AND THEN SHOVING IT
RIGHT BACK UP MY BUTT.

230
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,452
- REALLY, GIRL?

231
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,088
- PLUS, I'M TOTALLY FINE
SPENDING THE NIGHT IN.

232
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,889
- I'M GONNA FART.

233
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,224
- GO AHEAD, HONEY.

234
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,759
- NO, IT'S GONNA BE SO LOUD.

235
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,862
- COME ON, WE'VE BEEN
MARRIED FOR 25 YEARS.

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,635
- MY GOD;
MY GOD.

237
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,769
I...

238
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,007
I HAVE MESSED MYSELF.

239
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,975
OOH.

240
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,211
OOH, YEAH.

241
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,550
OKAY, OKAY.

242
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,686
- GIRL, YOU NEED
TO GET OUT THAT HOUSE.

243
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,454
- I'LL SEND YOU VIDEOS.

244
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,229
- YO, QUEEF, SICK PARTY!

245
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,630
- THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

246
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,899
I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING
THE DELICIOUS LIBATIONS

247
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,135
AND JOVIAL ATMOSPHERE, YEAH?

248
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,436
- HOW DID YOU GET YOUR PARENTS

249
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,604
TO LET YOU HAVE THE HOUSE
ALL WEEKEND?

250
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,272
- NOT EVEN A PROBLEM,
BROTHER.

251
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,976
YOU SEE, I HAVE AN OPEN DIALOGUE
WITH MATA AND PITA.

252
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,377
THEY RESPECT ME AS AN ADULT,

253
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,348
AND THEY TRUST
MY WISE DECISIONS.

254
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,951
- I JUST THREW UP
IN THIS GENIE BOTTLE.

255
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,554
- THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER!

256
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,122
- LET HER OUT, MAN.

257
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,291
LET HER OUT!

258
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:37,228
- ¶ I WAS LIKE, "EXCUSE ME
AND MY AWKWARD APPROACH" ¶

259
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,531
- HEY, THIS IS
MY PERSONAL HELL.

260
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,799
- SHIT, SHIT.

261
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,933
- AW, THAT'S ADORABLE.

262
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,334
YOU'RE STILL OBSESSED WITH HER.

263
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,470
- NO, I'M NOT STILL
OBSESSED WITH HER.

264
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,337
- YES, YOU ARE.

265
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,639
WHEN IS HER BIRTHDAY?

266
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,174
- JANUARY 15TH, 1996.

267
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,542
NICE TRY.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

268
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,143
- WELL, NO ONE GIVE'S A FUCK
ABOUT ME,

269
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,646
SO ONLY YOU SHOULD KNOW,
WHEN'S MY BIRTHDAY?

270
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,381
- UM...

271
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,083
TODAY?

272
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,084
MY GOD, TODAY.

273
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,119
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

274
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,456
All: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

275
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,658
- I FUCKING HATE YOU.

276
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,961
- LISTEN, THIS IS
MY LAST CHANCE.

277
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,797
JANIE IS MOVING DOWN TO FLORIDA
AT THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.

278
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,865
- MY GOD.
- I KNOW.

279
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,300
- NO WAY.
- YES.

280
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,768
- MY GOD, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE

281
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,802
CHRISTMAS BREAK AND SPRING BREAK

282
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:18,970
TO NOT FUCK HER.

283
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,338
- FALSE, BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO

284
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,940
VISIT MY STUPID,
DYING GRANDPARENTS

285
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,942
IN ARIZONA FOR CHRISTMAS.
BORING.

286
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,877
THEN I'M HITTING UP CANCUN
WITH THE PUSSY POSSE

287
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,345
FOR SPRING BREAK.

288
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,713
- I'M SORRY, WHAT THE FUCK
DID YOU JUST SAY?

289
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,581
PUSSY POSSE?

290
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,782
- IT'S MY CORNELL BOYS.

291
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,150
- THAT'S SO CUTE.

292
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,451
YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER
USE THAT NICKNAME AGAIN,

293
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,753
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE PENIS.

294
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,054
- OKAY, YOU'RE BEING
VERY AGGRESSIVE.

295
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,388
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

296
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,124
THIS IS MY LAST SHOT

297
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:43,261
BEFORE SHE IS
OUT OF MY LIFE FOREVER.

298
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,363
- OKAY, UM, LOOK,

299
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,165
I'M GONNA TRY REALLY,
REALLY HARD

300
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,266
NOT TO BE A DICK HERE,

301
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,334
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU'RE, LIKE,

302
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,535
REALLY SENSITIVE
AND EVERYTHING.

303
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,403
SHE WAS NOT INTO YOU
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

304
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,239
SHE'S NOT INTO YOU NOW.

305
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,040
AND SHE'S NEVER
GONNA BE INTO YOU.

306
00:12:56,042 --> 00:13:00,378
BUT I JUST--YOU KNOW, I FEEL
LIKE IT'S TIME WE MOVE ON.

307
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,546
- OKAY.

308
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,413
OKAY, YEAH.

309
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,615
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

310
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,649
YOU'RE RIGHT.

311
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,483
- SHIT, YOU, LIKE--

312
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,152
YOU HANDLED THAT REALLY WELL.

313
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,720
- PSYCH, NO,
I'M FUCKING WITH YOU.

314
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,422
SHE'S TOTALLY GONNA
SIT ON MY FACE LATER, LIKE...

315
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,527
- WOW, THAT'S REALLY NOT
HOW THAT GOES DOWN AT ALL,

316
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,095
SO IT'S CLEAR
YOU'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

317
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,130
- YES, I HAVE, I'VE EATEN OUT,
LIKE, 17 PUSSIES.

318
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,398
OR 23.
I DON'T KNOW.

319
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,033
I KNOW IT'S A PRIME NUMBER.

320
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,701
- GOD, PLEASE STOP DOING THAT.

321
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,702
DID YOU SPIT?

322
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,104
- YES.
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.

323
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,372
- A LITTLE BIT.
- DON'T SPIT.

324
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,873
WHERE DID THE STRAW COME FROM?

325
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,908
- MY BACKPACK.

326
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,209
- YOU HAVE A FUCKING BACKPACK?

327
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,210
- YES, I HAVE A BACKPACK.

328
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,211
IT'S AN ADVENTURE.

329
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,913
IT'S LIKE A HIKE.

330
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,582
THIS PARTY IS #LAME.

331
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,717
I'VE ONLY BEEN ROOFIED AND
FINGERED, LIKE, TWICE TONIGHT.

332
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,853
I MEAN, WHAT IS THIS,
A BAR MITZVAH?

333
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,189
- LET'S HIT UP THAT PARTY
ON OAK STREET.

334
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,424
I HEARD ETHYL'S GONNA BE THERE!

335
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,092
- EW, IS THAT YOUR GRANDMA?

336
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,694
NO OFFENSE,
BUT LAST TIME I SAW HER,

337
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,463
SHE PRETENDED TO TRIP AND
GRABBED MY COOCH FOR BALANCE.

338
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,500
- MY DAD IS ALWAYS TRIPPING.

339
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,936
- NO, YOU STUPID FUCKING DUMB
ECUADORIAN BITCH!

340
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,204
ETHYL'S THAT NEW HYBRID DRUG

341
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,605
EVERYBODY'S BEEN
BLAH-BLAH-ING ABOUT.

342
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,507
IT'S MOLLY MIXED
WITH OLD PEOPLE MEDICINE.

343
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,576
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TOTES CRAY.

344
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,811
- WELL, ANYONE WHO WOULD DO THAT
IS TOTES RETAR.

345
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,681
- HOLY ZACHARY QUINTO'S
EYEBROWS!

346
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,882
SHE'S LEARNING!

347
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,350
- NO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

348
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,686
HAVEN'T WE BEEN DOING
TOO MANY DRUGS LATELY?

349
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,693
- YOU TOTALLY HAD ME, BITCH!

350
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,896
HOLY SHIT,
THAT'S MY FUCKING JAM!

351
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,798
MANDY, HOLD MY LEGS.

352
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,436
YEAH.

353
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,272
I THINK I QUEEFED.

354
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,741
STOP LOOKING AT MY ASS,
YOU WHORE.

355
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,248
¶ ¶

356
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,783
- PHOTO BOMB!

357
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,552
SHIT, I'M SORRY.

358
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,287
FUCK, LET ME HELP YOU.

359
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,288
I'LL FIX IT.

360
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,289
LET ME HELP YOU DRY IT OFF.

361
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,058
I'LL DRY IT OFF.

362
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,660
- I HIGHLY ADVISE YOU

363
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:59,631
NOT TO TOUCH ANY
OF THE HAND TOWELS, OKAY?

364
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,080
- I GOT IT FROM HERE.

365
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,417
- RIGHT.

366
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,752
- MORE TOILET PAPER.

367
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,786
- YEAH, YEAH.

368
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,821
THERE YOU GO.

369
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,297
- IT'S NOT CREEPY AT ALL.

370
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,032
- YEAH, MY BAD.

371
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,134
SORRY.

372
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,335
SO...

373
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,804
HAVE YOU STARTED
APPLYING TO SCHOOLS YET?

374
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,872
- A FEW.

375
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:42,507
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I WANT TO GO YET.

376
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,775
- IF YOU'RE THINKING
OF CORNELL,

377
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,143
YOU CAN ALWAYS
COME VISIT WITH ME.

378
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,711
MY DORM IS SUPER COOL.

379
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,347
WE HAVE A SWIMMING TURTLE
NAMED RANDY.

380
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,282
SO, PRETTY FUCKING AWESOME.

381
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,817
- CORNELL?

382
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,354
NOT WITH THE "C" I HAVE
IN MR. DRAPER'S CLASS.

383
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,589
- DRAPER THE RAPER?

384
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,025
THOUGHT HE'D GIVE YOU
AN A-PLUS WITH THOSE TITTIES.

385
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,860
I MEAN, GOD DAMN.

386
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:03,995
- THANKS?

387
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,031
- DOES HE STILL SCHEDULE
THAT STUPID MIDTERM

388
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,000
FOR THE DAY
AFTER THANKSGIVING BREAK?

389
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,168
- YUP.

390
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,502
TURNS OUT HE'S NOT ONLY A PERV,

391
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,572
HE'S ALSO A FASCIST.

392
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,940
- YOU KNOW, I COULD HELP YOU.

393
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,443
I MEAN, I ACED--
I ACED DRAPER'S CLASS.

394
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,944
I KNOCKED THAT MIDTERM
OUT OF THE PARK.

395
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,213
I REMEMBER HE ACTUALLY
SAID TO ME, AND I QUOTE,

396
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,549
"YOU MADE THAT MIDTERM
YOUR BITCH."

397
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,985
OR, NO--OR HE SAID,
"YOU DID A GOOD JOB."

398
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,486
BUT HE MEANT IT, SO...

399
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,021
I MEAN, DON'T WORRY.

400
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,456
NO CHARGE.

401
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,158
JUST TWO STUDY BUDDIES
DOING WHAT THEY DO,

402
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,326
SHOOTING THE SHIT.

403
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,627
WHIP OUT A HIGHLIGHTER OR TWO,

404
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,796
MAKE SOME MARKS
ON THOSE TEXTBOOKS.

405
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:43,034
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
WHAT THE LIBRARIAN SAYS.

406
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,303
- OKAY, WHAT THE HELL.

407
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,671
- SERIOUSLY?

408
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,306
- - OKAY.

409
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,440
YEAH, YES.

410
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,342
SO YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS.

411
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,477
I PROMISE.

412
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,413
HOW IS 8:00 ON FRIDAY?

413
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,647
- SOUNDS GOOD.

414
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,916
- GOOD, I THINK SO TOO, YEAH.

415
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,386
OKAY.

416
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,420
BYE.

417
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,590
I LOVE YOU, SO MUCH.

418
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:09,193
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE DRANK IN, LIKE, EVER.

419
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,895
BUT I FEEL TOTALLY FINE.

420
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,164
- YEAH, NO, YOU LOOK
TOTALLY GREAT,

421
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,432
NOT AT ALL LIKE A RHINO

422
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,701
WHO'S BEEN SHOT
WITH A TRANQUILIZER GUN.

423
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,471
I THINK THE FUCKING
TIKKA MASALA SHIT'S

424
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,373
GONNA COME BACK UP.

425
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,915
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

426
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,617
WANT TO HOOK UP?

427
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,253
- SHE SAID YES.

428
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,254
SHE SAID YES.

429
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,622
MOVE, FUCKERS.

430
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,290
SHE SAID YES, SHE SAID YES,
SHE SAID YES.

431
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,025
NO.

432
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,160
- YEAH.

433
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,528
SO I'M GONNA GO NOW.

434
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,529
- HEY, MOTHERFUCK,

435
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,530
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

436
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,764
SHE SAID YES.

437
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,833
- MY GOD,
THAT IS SO EXCITING.

438
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,501
HEY, AT WHAT POINT
IN THIS CONVERSATION

439
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,271
ARE WE GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT I'M COVERED IN VOMIT?

440
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,338
- WHAT AM I GONNA WEAR?

441
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,140
SHOULD I WEAR A SUIT?

442
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,643
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE
SEXY-ASS TIGHT VESTS

443
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,344
WITH, LIKE, A DRAGON ON IT
FOR NO FUCKING REASON.

444
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,779
AND SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT'S THAT?"

445
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,214
AND I'M LIKE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

446
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,882
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO TAKE HER FOR DINNER,

447
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,417
BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY WANT
TO TAKE HER SOMEWHERE NICE,

448
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,586
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO FREAK HER OUT.

449
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,254
- THERE'S ABOUT TEN
DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS

450
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,389
UP IN THAT GIRL'S VOMIT,

451
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,724
SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PICK.

452
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,128
- TEXT ME.

453
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,297
- SUCK A DICK.

454
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,099
- NO.

455
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,813
- SHIT, LOOK, I'M SORRY,

456
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,016
BUT YOU CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

457
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,853
SCOTT?

458
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,387
- DO I KNOW YOU?

459
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:47,158
- WE WENT TO
HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.

460
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,392
AND MIDDLE SCHOOL,

461
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:52,430
AND ELEMENTARY.

462
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,631
- TORI THE WHORIE?

463
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,166
- AND WE'RE BACK.

464
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,567
- WOW.

465
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,002
YOU LOOK KIND OF GOOD NOW.

466
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,103
YOU KNOW, THAT NICKNAME

467
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,439
MIGHT NOT EVEN BE
THAT IRONIC ANYMORE.

468
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:02,840
- CHARMING, OKAY.

469
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,642
WELL, YOU'RE NOT DEAD,
SO I'M GONNA GO.

470
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,444
BUT THIS HAS BEEN SO FUN.

471
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,979
THANK YOU.

472
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,682
FUCK.

473
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,886
CAN I GET A RIDE?

474
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,692
SO YOU KNOW THIS IS
A REALLY BAD IDEA, RIGHT?

475
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,728
- IT SAYS THE PARTY IS
ONLY ONE MILE FROM HERE.

476
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,129
- FANTASTIC,
I'M GLAD THERE'S AN APP

477
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,931
THAT CAN MAKE STALKING
MORE EFFICIENT.

478
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,566
- I'M NOT STALKING, OKAY?

479
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,035
I'M MERELY USING TECHNOLOGY
TO HELP ME LOCATE SOMEONE

480
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,071
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME
AT THE MOMENT.

481
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,072
WHICH IS STALKING.

482
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,309
- OOH, MAKE THAT LEFT.

483
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,979
- YOU DO REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE PATHETIC, RIGHT?

484
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:46,083
- YOU DO REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE COVERED IN VOMIT, RIGHT?

485
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,085
BESIDES, HEATHER'S
GONNA TAKE ME BACK.

486
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,354
- FANTASTIC, SO NOT ONLY
ARE YOU A STALKER,

487
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,589
BUT YOU'RE A MISOGYNIST TOO.

488
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,990
- AND I'M A ROMANTIC.

489
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,092
- HO-HO, AND WHY WOULD
HEATHER TAKE YOU BACK?

490
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,627
'CAUSE I THINK SHE'S
MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR

491
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,963
THAT SHE WANTS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

492
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,398
- SHE JUST NEEDS
SOME TIME TO THINK

493
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,532
AND, YOU KNOW, REEVALUATE.

494
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,533
SHE'LL BE FINE.

495
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,035
- WOW.

496
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,704
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SHE MUST BE
IN A WEIRD MENTAL PLACE

497
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,974
TO DUMP YOU, MR. PERFECT
WITH THE AMAZING HAIR.

498
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,409
- THINK I HAVE AMAZING HAIR?

499
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,743
- MY GOD,
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.

500
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,145
IT'S ANNOYING.

501
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,614
- WOW, AMAZING HAIR
AND I'M ATTRACTIVE?

502
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,316
- YEAH, HERE I GO.

503
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,617
- WAIT A MINUTE.

504
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,952
ARE YOU INTO ME?

505
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,020
- NO, GOD,
I'M NOT INTO YOU.

506
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,922
I MEAN, WOULD I HAVE SEX
WITH YOU?

507
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,825
YEAH, PROBABLY, BUT THAT DOES
NOT MEAN THAT I'M INTO YOU.

508
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,927
- YOU'D HAVE SEX WITH ME?

509
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,464
WOW, I MEAN, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

510
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,299
I'M JUST SURPRISED
THAT YOU ACTUALLY ADMITTED THAT.

511
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,968
- MY GOD, IT'S 2014.

512
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,836
WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE
TO OPENLY TALK ABOUT SEX.

513
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,271
- I MEAN, I KNOW
WHAT YEAR IT IS.

514
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,606
I'M JUST SAYING--

515
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:42,873
- OKAY, HERE'S THE THING,
PROM KING.

516
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,175
WOMEN THINK ABOUT SEX
ALL THE TIME,

517
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,977
INCLUDING YOUR PRECIOUS,
WONDERFUL HEATHER.

518
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,912
SO IF SHE WANTED YOU
IN HER BED,

519
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,847
YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS CAR
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

520
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,517
AND THAT IS A FACT.

521
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,219
WAIT,
HOLD ON ONE SECOND,

522
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,088
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT
TO FILM THIS,

523
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,425
BECAUSE FAIL VIDEOS
ALWAYS GO VIRAL.

524
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,461
GO ON.

525
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,562
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

526
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:05,630
MAYBE NOW ISN'T THE BEST TIME.

527
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,797
- NO, COME ON, SCOTT.

528
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,232
THE INTERNET WANTS TO SEE YOU

529
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,369
GET KICKED IN THE BALLS
REALLY BAD.

530
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,170
- WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?

531
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,572
- I'M MEAN?

532
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,240
WOW, THAT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.

533
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,576
I RECALL IT GOING A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

534
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,545
MAYBE NOBODY HAS TOLD YOU
THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS OVER.

535
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,514
THAT BIG CEREMONY THING
THAT WE ALL DID,

536
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,749
THAT WAS GRADUATION,

537
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,816
WHERE WE ALL MOVE ON

538
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,084
AND WE ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS.

539
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,452
YOU DON'T STAY HERE
AND BE LIKE,

540
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,720
"I WAS PROM KING; I'M COOL,

541
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:30,888
SO THAT MEANS
I'M COOL FOREVER."

542
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,390
NOBODY GIVES A SHIT.

543
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,992
SO MAYBE IT'S TIME
THAT YOU TRY SOMETHING NEW.

544
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,494
TRY SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT,

545
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,362
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS WHOLE--

546
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,177
- WAIT, WAIT.

547
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,813
I DON'T HAVE
ANY CONDOMS ON ME.

548
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,317
WHO ARE YOU?

549
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,718
- TORI THE WHORIE.

550
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,886
- YEAH,
I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME.

551
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,155
- YEAH, YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE.

552
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,662
- TORI THE WHORIE
IS BACK, BITCH!

553
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,830
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

554
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,265
SHE NEVER EXISTED.

555
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,734
SECOND OF ALL,
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

556
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:20,338
IT WAS A BIG, STUPID MISTAKE.

557
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,939
- HOW BIG?

558
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:22,907
- WHAT?

559
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,275
- COME ON, GIRL,
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

560
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,377
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT PORN
SINCE I GOT HOME.

561
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,546
IT WAS HUGE, ENORMOUS.

562
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,714
AND HE PUT IT IN MY BUTT

563
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,182
AND SLAPPED ME IN MY FACE
WITH IT.

564
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,317
- I KNOW YOU'RE LYING, BUT...

565
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,452
THANK YOU.

566
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,620
- I JUST--I REALLY WANT
TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

567
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,489
- SO YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN?

568
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,890
- NO, IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

569
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,625
I'M NEVER TALKING
TO THAT DOUCHE AGAIN.

570
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,428
AND DOES HE KNOW THAT?

571
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,663
- PLEASE.

572
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,598
SCOTT IS SO FAR
UP HIS OWN ASS,

573
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,066
HE WON'T EVEN NOTICE.

574
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,702
- HOW FAR?

575
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,773
- HERE'S THE TURKEY.

576
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:56,841
HERE'S THE BIRD.

577
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:15,059
HEY, I'M SORRY YOU GUYS
GOT STUCK OVER HERE.

578
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,329
- HEY, AT LEAST WE DON'T
HAVE TO SIT WITH CRAZY AUNT FLO.

579
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,364
- DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TIME

580
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,066
I GOT ABDUCTED BY ALIENS?

581
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,135
FUNNY STORY, ACTUALLY.

582
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,371
THEIR QUEEN IMPREGNATED ME,

583
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:32,843
AND THE BABY GREW TO FULL SIZE
IN LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS.

584
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,780
AND THEN IT ATE ITS WAY
OUT OF MY UTERUS.

585
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,314
WANT TO SEE THE SCAR?

586
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,585
- WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE
AN ALCOHOLIC AUNT

587
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,387
LIKE EVERY OTHER FAMILY?

588
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:47,458
- TODAY, YOU CAN CONSIDER ME
AN ALCOHOLIC FATHER.

589
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,598
- HEY, YOU REMEMBER
TORI THE WHORIE?

590
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,436
- THE GIRL WHOSE PIMPLES
USED TO POP IN THE SUNLIGHT?

591
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,470
- THAT WAS GRAPHIC.

592
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,571
YES.

593
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:01,572
YOU SHOULD SEE HER NOW.

594
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:02,673
SHE LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

595
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,108
- NO THANKS.

596
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,176
- NO, SERIOUSLY, LOOK.

597
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,377
SHE'S, LIKE, PHOTOSHOPPED.

598
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,578
- NO, SERIOUSLY,

599
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,648
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR DUMB LITTLE CRUSH.

600
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,016
- I DON'T HAVE A CRUSH.

601
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,684
I MEAN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

602
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,786
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS RIDICULOUS?

603
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,254
"MODERN MEDICINE."

604
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,824
I MEAN, WHY DO I NEED
A "DOCTOR"

605
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,392
TO TELL ME THAT I'M "CRAZY"

606
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:23,961
AND A "DANGER TO MYSELF
AND OTHERS"?

607
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,729
I MEAN, HELLO?

608
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,133
I ALREADY HAVE THE VOICES
IN MY HEAD TELLING ME THAT.

609
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:35,206
I CAN'T KILL THEM.
THEY'RE FAMILY.

610
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,813
- YOU KNOW MENTAL ILLNESS
RUNS IN OUR FAMILY, RIGHT?

611
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,550
- HEY, AS LONG AS BALDNESS
DOESN'T, THEN I'M FINE.

612
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:49,987
- BUT WHAT I'M MOST THANKFUL FOR

613
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,190
IS JOINING
THIS WONDERFUL FAMILY.

614
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:57,261
I FEEL LIKE THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN WESTERN P.A.

615
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,296
AW, HECK, IN THE ENTIRE STATE
OF PENNSYLVANIA.

616
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,401
- MARISSA, HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU
MOST THANKFUL FOR?

617
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:09,206
WELL, OTHER THAN THIS
BEAUTIFUL TREASURE OF A MAN.

618
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,708
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

619
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,976
- GREAT, NEXT.

620
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,210
- I'M THANKFUL
THAT MY PAINTINGS

621
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,713
WERE SELECTED
TO HANG AT THE MET.

622
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,449
- YOU DID.

623
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:22,186
- AND THAT I FINALLY
LEARNED HOW TO DRIVE!

624
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,621
- YES!

625
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:24,655
SCARY.

626
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,723
- YOU DID.

627
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,057
YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION, SWEETIE.

628
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,392
- YEAH, NO, WE GET IT,
SHE'S PERFECT.

629
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,060
NOW, COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
PASS THE WINE

630
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,263
SO I CAN DRINK
TILL I BLACK THE FUCK OUT?

631
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,430
- LANGUAGE!

632
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,966
- LOOK, I'M REAL NICE
WHEN I'M DRUNK.

633
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,577
YEAH.

634
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,438
- AW, SHE'S PRETTY.

635
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,775
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

636
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,577
- THE REAL QUESTION IS,

637
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:24,315
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

638
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,683
P'SHOO!

639
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,822
WHAT?

640
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,325
- I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

641
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:37,227
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU MADE THIS FROM SCRATCH.

642
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:40,931
- WHO WANTS TO PLAY
DANCE CENTRAL?

643
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:41,999
I DO!

644
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,400
- I WANT TO KILL MYSELF.

645
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,401
- YAY!

646
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,436
LET'S PLAY.

647
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:50,341
- HEY, TORE,
CAN YOU GET THE DOOR?

648
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,545
- GIL, YOU ARE SO CLEVER.

649
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,646
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

650
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,715
SHE'S RUBBING OFF ON ME.

651
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,618
- OKAY, WELL,
IF I'M NOT BACK IN FIVE,

652
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,719
ASSUME THAT I'M DEAD,

653
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,253
AND DON'T COME LOOKING FOR ME.

654
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,556
- OKEYDOKEY, HONEY.

655
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,260
YEAH, GIL,
YOU SHOULD TRY <i>MY</i> PIE.

656
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,832
- WHAT THE HELL?

657
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,033
- HEY.

658
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,167
- DID YOU RUN HERE?

659
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,469
- I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU,

660
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,770
AND YOU WEREN'T
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE.

661
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,205
- YEAH, IT'S THANKSGIVING,

662
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,606
AND MY MOM MAKES US
PUT OUR PHONES AND BEEPERS

663
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,541
IN A BASKET BEFORE WE
SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE.

664
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,576
- WHO HAS A BEEPER?

665
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:26,577
- GIL.

666
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,978
- I'M A DOCTOR!

667
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,981
- ORTHODONTIST!

668
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,751
SO YOU WANTED SOMETHING?

669
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:34,918
- WHEN WE HAD SEX LAST NIGHT--

670
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,054
- MY GOD, DUDE.

671
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,590
MY PARENTS ARE, LIKE,
RIGHT IN THERE.

672
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,859
- SORRY.

673
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,360
WHEN WE HAD SEX LAST NIGHT...

674
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,097
- DID YOU FEEL SOMETHING?

675
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,034
- IT TOOK ME A MINUTE,
BUT YEAH.

676
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,101
- COME ON, I'M SERIOUS.

677
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,137
LIKE--LIKE A...

678
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,438
CONNECTION?

679
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,406
- MY GOD.

680
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,174
PLEASE DO NOT SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT.

681
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,410
I MEAN, IT'S SO PROM-Y.

682
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,412
YOU'RE, LIKE,
SO STUCK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

683
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:02,846
IT'S REALLY FRIGHTENING.

684
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,448
- YOU CAN'T SAY
YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

685
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,783
- I MEAN, I THOUGHT
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR

686
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:08,919
THAT WE WERE JUST TWO
SAD, HORNY ADULTS

687
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,320
GETTING SOME IN A CAR.

688
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,489
IT WAS JUST SEX, NOTHING MORE.

689
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,260
OKAY, LOOK, I GET IT.

690
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,128
YOU'RE LIKE--
YOUR GIRLFRIEND DUMPS YOU,

691
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,596
AND THEN YOU RANDOMLY
HOOK UP WITH ME,

692
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,865
AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
ALL CONFUSED AND SHIT.

693
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,500
AND I UNDERSTAND.

694
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,302
BUT I THINK IT'S BEST
IF YOU JUST, LIKE,

695
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,705
LEAVE ME OUT OF THE EQUATION
ALTOGETHER, OKAY?

696
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,739
- TORTELLINI!

697
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,973
WHAT'S GOING ON?

698
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,341
- NOTHING, MOM, WE'RE JUST--

699
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,211
- OOH, WHO'S THIS
STRAPPING YOUNG MAN?

700
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,180
- HE WAS ACTUALLY
JUST LEAVING.

701
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,948
- HEY, I'M SCOTT,
FRIEND OF TORI'S.

702
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,049
- GOT A GRIP.

703
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,317
- FRIEND, THAT'S INTERESTING.

704
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,052
- WELL, COME ON IN, SCOTT.

705
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,755
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO PLAY
DANCE CENTRAL.

706
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,090
- YEAH, I DO HAVE
SOME PRETTY SICK MOVES.

707
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,291
YOU KNOW, IN HIGH SCHOOL,

708
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,792
THEY USED TO CALL ME
A DEPRESSED DOG.

709
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,461
- NO, WHY?

710
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,597
- WELL, 'CAUSE I AIN'T GOT
NO BONES!

711
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,099
- WHOA!

712
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,203
- DID THEY ALSO CALL YOU
THE SCARECROW?

713
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:03,307
'CAUSE YOU AIN'T GOT NO BRAIN!

714
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:06,043
- OKAY, I LIKE
SCOTT'S JOKE BETTER.

715
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,345
COME ON, I'LL STEAL YOU.

716
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,646
- WE'RE DANCING.

717
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,151
GOOD.

718
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,219
SERIOUSLY?

719
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,425
¶ ¶

720
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,660
- SHE'S AN INSPIRATION!

721
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,396
- PERFECT!

722
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,699
AWESOME!

723
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,634
MARISSA WINS.

724
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,039
- OKAY, TORA THE EXPLORER,

725
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,241
IT'S YOUR TURN.

726
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,978
- COME ON, TORE,
HIT THE DANCE FLOOR.

727
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,379
THEY JUST COME TO ME.

728
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,615
- WHAT'S WRONG,
ANGELINA TORI?

729
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,649
SCARED TO LOSE?

730
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,484
- NO, NO, NO,
I JUST HATE DANCING.

731
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,553
- YOU SEEM
TO HATE A LOT OF THINGS.

732
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,420
- YEAH, I DO.

733
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,789
I HATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE.

734
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,223
IT'S KIND OF MY THING.

735
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,226
- WELL, WE DON'T HATE YOU,
TORE.

736
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,729
- I'M A LITTLE SCARED OF YOU,
BUT I DON'T HATE YOU.

737
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:00,197
- IT'S OKAY.

738
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,265
- YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

739
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,033
FINE, I WILL PLAY.

740
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,936
BUT IF I WIN,
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

741
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:06,937
- ALL RIGHT.

742
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:10,140
BUT IF I WIN...

743
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,809
YOU HAVE TO KISS ME.

744
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:15,245
- I WANT TO PLAY!

745
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,649
OR TORI CAN PLAY.

746
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:26,156
¶ ¶

747
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,159
- COOL MOVE.

748
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,795
AWESOME!

749
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,130
RIGHT ON.

750
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,632
- HEY, WE WORK
PRETTY WELL TOGETHER.

751
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:39,536
- THIS IS HOW I ALWAYS PICTURED
BLACK PEOPLE PLAYING THIS GAME.

752
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,438
- WE'RE MUCH STRONGER
AS A TEAM.

753
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,307
WE SHOULD CHALLENGE
MARISSA AND GIL.

754
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,842
- I DON'T REALLY DO TEAMS.

755
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,044
- WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL FIND
THAT HAVING A PARTNER

756
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,446
TO KEEP YOU ON BEAT
IS A GOOD THING.

757
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,948
I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING

758
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,783
WE SHOULD START AN OFFICIAL
DANCE CLUB OR ANYTHING.

759
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,151
- FOOT SLIDE!

760
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:57,020
- I'M SAYING MAYBE JUST TRY IT
FOR ONE GAME, YOU KNOW?

761
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,722
- SLAP THE GROUND!

762
00:30:58,724 --> 00:30:59,623
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

763
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,124
MIGHT MAKE YOU
A BETTER DANCER.

764
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,226
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

765
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,027
MAYBE I DON'T WANT A PARTNER

766
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,063
WHO'S MERELY AVERAGE-SIZED,

767
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,631
SOMEWHAT HERKY-JERKY,

768
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,933
AND PAYS NOWHERE CLOSE
TO THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL

769
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:14,671
THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT
FROM AN ASPIRING PHOTOGRAPHER.

770
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:18,709
- TORI WINS.

771
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,945
- CONGRATS.

772
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:23,680
GUESS I GOT TO GO NOW, RIGHT?

773
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,116
AW.

774
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,887
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

775
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,521
BYE.

776
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:46,403
- ¶ AND YOU ARE MY RADIO ¶

777
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,374
¶ TURN YOU UP WHEN I FEEL LOW ¶

778
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:55,712
¶ YOU ARE THE SOUNDTRACK

779
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,814
¶ YOU ARE THE ROCK

780
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,249
<i>WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?</i>

781
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,551
I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

782
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:20,003
WOW, BABY, YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

783
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,271
WHERE DID YOU LEARN?

784
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,273
DID YOUR MAMA TEACH YOU?

785
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,809
GOD,
YOU ARE THE BLOWJOB QUEEN.

786
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:29,012
SOMEONE SHOULD GIVE YOU
A CROWN MADE OUT OF DICKS,

787
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,114
MADE OUT OF WANGS.

788
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,149
I'M GONNA CUM.

789
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,450
OOPS-A-DAISY.

790
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,484
DON'T WANT TO COME
IN YOUR MOUTH.

791
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,485
YOU'RE A LADY.

792
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,887
WHERE SHOULD I DO IT?

793
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,455
IDEA.

794
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,357
ON THOSE TITS!

795
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,392
- HEY, WHAT YOU LOOKING AT?

796
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,393
- THE INTERNET.

797
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,495
THERE'S JUST PICTURES

798
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,799
OF ARCTIC CREATURES,
POLAR BEARS.

799
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,200
- POLAR BEARS.
- GOING EXTINCT.

800
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,501
- I SEE.

801
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,603
- YO, DICK-MUNCHER, TIME TO GO.

802
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,838
BLACK FRIDAY'S ALMOST OVER,

803
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,507
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYBODY DIE YET.

804
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:05,048
- THIS--

805
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,216
HOMEWORK.

806
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,118
SEX-ED.

807
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,053
NEVER MIND.

808
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,293
OKAY, SO THIS ONE
IS A BIT ON THE PRICIER SIDE.

809
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,095
BUT SHE PINNED IT
MULTIPLE TIMES

810
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,663
TO HER PERSONAL PINTEREST PAGE,

811
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:23,000
AND I WANT HER TO FEEL
AS BEAUTIFUL AS I DO RIGHT NOW,

812
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,535
WHICH IS VERY.

813
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,238
- I JUST WANT YOU TO REALIZE
HOW FUCKED UP THIS IS.

814
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,806
- IF BY "FUCKED UP"
YOU MEAN AWESOME

815
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,275
AND SEXUALLY STIMULATING,
THEN I AGREE.

816
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:33,677
BUT I NEED YOU
TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW,

817
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,013
BECAUSE I NEED
YOUR BRUTAL HONESTY.

818
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,518
- YEAH, THAT'S WAY TOO SLUTTY.

819
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,086
IF YOU GIVE THAT TO HER,

820
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,955
SHE'S GONNA THINK
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BANG HER.

821
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,089
- BUT I AM.

822
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,324
- YES, I KNOW.

823
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:51,294
BUT THE KEY IS
TO MAKE HER FORGET THAT.

824
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,130
- GOOD NOTE.

825
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,269
- HEY, TORI.

826
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,638
- WHAT THE FUCK?

827
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,473
- HEY, CRAZY, RIGHT?

828
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,844
- UM, HEY, I JUST WANT
TO SAY SORRY

829
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,180
FOR COMING TO YOUR FAMILY'S
DINNER LAST NIGHT.

830
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,315
THAT WAS--
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

831
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,717
IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

832
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,620
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS INAPPROPRIATE?

833
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:19,122
YOU STALKING
MY INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT

834
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,757
AND FOLLOWING ME HERE.

835
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,326
- DOES THIS LOOK TOO, LIKE,
"OOH, I DID ANAL ONCE,

836
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,328
AND NOW IT'S ALL I WANT"?

837
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,030
SCOTT.

838
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,432
DID JANIE SEND YOU?

839
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:31,234
- WHAT?
NO, WHY WOULD SHE?

840
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,736
- NO REASON.

841
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:36,606
- OKAY.

842
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,842
SO BACK TO YOU STALKING ME.

843
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:41,178
- AW, YOU THOUGHT
I'M STALKING YOU?

844
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,612
NO, I WAS JUST TAKING PICTURES
IN THE MALL,

845
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,047
AND I SAW YOU
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

846
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,683
- 'CAUSE THAT DOESN'T
SOUND CREEPY.

847
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,388
- I LIKE SHOOTING
ALL THE BLACK FRIDAY CRAZINESS.

848
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,589
USUALLY GET
SOME PRETTY COOL STUFF.

849
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,857
I MEAN, FOR THE MOST PART,

850
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,194
IT'S JUST RANDOM PEOPLE
GETTING TASERED.

851
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,162
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE THAT.

852
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:11,408
DUDE, THIS IS FUCKED UP.

853
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,577
WOULD YOU SEND THESE TO ME?

854
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:19,116
AW.

855
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:23,386
I FOUND YOUR FETISH.

856
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,622
IT'S NOT A FETISH.

857
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,724
- HEY, LOOK CLOSE.

858
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,426
YOU SEE HOW THAT OLD COUPLE
IS SITTING PERFECTLY

859
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:32,329
RIGHT BETWEEN THAT TRASH CAN
AND THAT STAINED GLASS WINDOW

860
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,530
AND THAT FOUNTAIN?

861
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,565
IT'S LIKE--

862
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,101
IT'S KIND OF LIKE BEAUTY
MEETS ITS OPPOSITE.

863
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,536
YOU KNOW?

864
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,271
AMIDST ALL THE CRAZINESS
OF BLACK FRIDAY

865
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:44,441
AND EVERYBODY'S
FREAKING OUT AROUND THEM,

866
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,243
THEY'RE SAFE, YOU KNOW?

867
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:50,480
THEY FOUND THEIR LITTLE PLACE
TO GO AND SHARE A KISS.

868
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,350
IT'S KIND OF CUTE, BEAUTIFUL.

869
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:56,219
- MY GOD.

870
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,755
I DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH THE COOL GUY.

871
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,991
I SLEPT WITH
THE FORMERLY COOL GUY

872
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:05,529
WHO'S ACTUALLY
A BIG FRICKIN' DORK.

873
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,763
I'M NOT A DORK.

874
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:07,797
I'M COOL.

875
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,266
- I'M CURRENTLY COOL.

876
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,367
- OKAY.

877
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,668
SO THEN, JUST TELL ME

878
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,137
ONE CURRENTLY COOL THING
THAT YOU'VE DONE

879
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,206
POST-GRADUATION.

880
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,614
WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?

881
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,782
- I DON'T KNOW, WHY?

882
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,350
- 'CAUSE WE'RE HANGING OUT.

883
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,686
REALLY?

884
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,754
- ALL RIGHT.

885
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:31,788
- BUT I AM DRIVING,

886
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,123
AND I AM PLANNING EVERYTHING.

887
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,459
AND YOU HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING THAT I SAY.

888
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:39,362
- ALL RIGHT, DEAL.

889
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,764
- ALL RIGHT.

890
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,799
NOW GO CONTINUE TAKING
THOSE CREEPY PICTURES,

891
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,467
AND QUIT STALKING ME.

892
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,436
- IS THIS GUY STALKING YOU?

893
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,897
- ¶ I USED TO WAIT FOR HER
AFTER SCHOOL ¶

894
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,234
¶ BY THE GATES WITH MY BOOKS,
BABY, FEELING A FOOL ¶

895
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:21,071
¶ I USED TO WALK HER HOME
EVERY NIGHT ¶

896
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,975
¶ IN THE SUMMER OR WINTER,
IN THE SUN OR ICE ¶

897
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,022
- FUCK IT LIST.

898
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,724
OKAY, WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF BUCKET LIST?

899
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,325
- YEAH, EXCEPT
YOU DON'T DIE IN IT.

900
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,628
- I MEAN, SPOILER ALERT.

901
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,429
- OKAY, THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

902
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,999
YOU'RE LIKE, SO REGIMENTED.

903
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,200
I MEAN, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

904
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:52,135
HAS TO BE, LIKE,
SO FUCKING PERFECT,

905
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,837
OR YOU, LIKE, FREAK OUT.

906
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,238
SO, WHAT I'M GONNA DO

907
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,707
IS JUST LOOSEN YOU UP
A LITTLE BIT.

908
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:00,910
- I'M NOT SHAVING MY HEAD.

909
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,680
- OKAY, ONE THING AT A TIME.

910
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:04,848
- SERIOUSLY, I'M NOT DOING IT.

911
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,982
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

912
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,450
YOU'RE SO REGIMENTED.

913
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,818
- LOOK AT IT.
- I SEE IT.

914
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,819
- LOOK AT THE WAY IT FLOWS.

915
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:10,854
- NO, YEAH, I SEE IT.

916
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,389
- LOOK AT HOW IT MOVES.

917
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,124
- YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

918
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:19,396
YOU'RE SO SET IN YOUR LITTLE
PERFECT SCOTT HAIR WAYS.

919
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,765
- FINE, OKAY, CAN WE JUST DO
SOMETHING A LITTLE EASIER

920
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,199
TO EASE ME INTO IT?

921
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,234
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

922
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,468
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
PROBABLY START

923
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,771
WITH NUMBER FOUR.

924
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,542
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

925
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,543
- YEAH.
- NO.

926
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,544
- YOU CERTAINLY ARE.

927
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:35,812
- NO FUCKING WAY.

928
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,213
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
- NO.

929
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,021
- SERIOUSLY, JUST POOP ALREADY.

930
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,790
- I'M TRYING, OKAY?

931
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,857
I HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH.

932
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,526
- MY GOD.

933
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:50,694
- TURN AROUND.

934
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:51,795
- WHAT?

935
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:52,796
- TURN AROUND.

936
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,197
- SERIOUSLY?

937
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,465
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

938
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,933
- PLUG YOUR EARS.

939
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,768
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- IT'S GONNA BE LOUD.

940
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,640
- SCOTT?

941
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,774
- SHIT!

942
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,043
ABORT MISSION!
ABORT MISSION!

943
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,111
GO, GO!

944
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,480
- IT'S LOCKED.
- JUST GET IN!

945
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:13,516
GET THE FUCK IN THE CAR!

946
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,688
- WHY WEREN'T YOU
INTO POOP STUFF

947
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,657
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER?

948
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:23,493
- ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
WE HAVE FUN ¶

949
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:27,263
¶ WE GOT THE SUMMER NIGHTS
UNDER OUR TONGUES ¶

950
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,671
MY GOD.

951
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,773
DON'T EVEN.

952
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,174
WHAT--

953
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,876
ASSHOLE.

954
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:54,357
- ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
WE HAVE FUN ¶

955
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:07,070
¶ WE HAVE FUN,
WE HAVE FUN ¶

956
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,645
- BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,
I GUESS.

957
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,347
- YEAH, IT'S SO TRUE.

958
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,949
- WELL, IT'S HARD TO PREPARE
FOR IT WHEN IT'S RAPE.

959
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,420
KIDDING.

960
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,788
NO, I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.

961
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,656
YEAH, I DEFINITELY,
DEFINITELY WANTED IT.

962
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,893
- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE
IT WASN'T WITH HIM.

963
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:30,994
- SHE'S KIDDING.

964
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,695
- NO, I'M NOT.

965
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,698
- WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THE BABY.

966
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,766
- THANK YOU, YEAH.

967
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,702
WE ARE GONNA NEED IT.

968
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,237
- YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, MA'AM.

969
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,107
- YEAH, BYE.

970
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,242
WHOA!

971
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,815
- NO WAY.

972
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:52,816
- COME ON.

973
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:53,817
DON'T BE A PUSSY.

974
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,051
- IT'S PERMANENT.

975
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:55,852
- YEAH.

976
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,320
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

977
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,222
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

978
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,626
- I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

979
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,661
IT'S GONNA HURT.

980
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:05,962
- STOP BEING SUCH A BABY.

981
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,532
- AY, CAN YOU PLEASE
HURRY THE FUCK UP?

982
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,501
MY DAUGHTER IS WAITING.

983
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,006
- GO!

984
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,477
- SEE?

985
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,445
THAT WASN'T THAT BAD.

986
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:25,648
- I GUESS IT WASN'T.

987
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,319
IS ANYONE ELSE
LOSING THEIR VISION?

988
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,825
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T
PIERCE YOUR DICK.

989
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,798
- I'M NOT REALLY
A POT KIND OF GUY.

990
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,866
- YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S FINE.

991
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:43,967
I'LL GET THE CLIPPERS.

992
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,268
- GIVE ME THAT FUCKING BROWNIE.

993
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,536
- MY GOD.

994
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,271
- OKAY, WHAT IF IT MAKES ME
ALL CHATTY AND PARANOID

995
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:49,772
AND ANNOYING?

996
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,641
- MY GOSH, THEN WE'RE GONNA
KNOW THAT IT DIDN'T WORK.

997
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,809
- IS IT GLUTEN-FREE?

998
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,310
I HAVE A REALLY
SENSITIVE STOMACH.

999
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,912
- MY GOD, I KNOW YOU HAVE
A SENSITIVE EVERYTHING.

1000
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,881
YES, IT'S GLUTEN-FREE.

1001
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,888
MY GOD.

1002
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:05,989
- THAT'S FUCKING GOOD.

1003
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:06,990
- I KNOW.

1004
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:07,924
- THAT'S REAL GOOD.

1005
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:10,793
- ISN'T THAT GOOD?

1006
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,862
- I THINK I'M HIGH.

1007
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,602
- ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
WE HAVE FUN ¶

1008
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:23,907
¶ WE GOT THE SUMMER NIGHTS
UNDER OUR TONGUES ¶

1009
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,178
ARE YOU READY?

1010
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,550
- ¶ WE HAVE FUN,
WE HAVE FUN ¶

¶ ¶

1013
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:54,971
- YOUR CAR BROKE DOWN,

1014
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:57,574
SO YOU RENTED A PARTY BUS?

1015
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,077
- I DID, YEAH.

1016
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,378
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

1017
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,914
IT'S JUST NICE
TO TREAT YOURSELF.

1018
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,683
- QUIT THE BULLSHIT, JOEL.

1019
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,850
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1020
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,219
- NO BULLSHIT.
NOTHING IS GOING ON,

1021
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:14,157
BESIDES THE START
OF OUR GLORIOUS EVENING.

1022
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,093
- NO SEX IN THE CAR, KIDS.

1023
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,494
LAST THING I WANT TO SEE

1024
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,730
IS TWO UNDERAGE,

1025
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,165
SEMI-ETHNIC-LOOKING,

1026
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,601
POSSIBLY NATIVE AMERICAN
TEENAGERS

1027
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:28,404
MAKING A MESS ON MY
BRAND-NEW PLEATHER INTERIOR,

1028
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:31,107
FORCING ME TO
LAP, LAP, LAP IT UP

1029
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,978
LIKE A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
ON A HOT-ASS DAY.

1030
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,781
FUCK.

1031
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,650
- WELL, I FEEL SAFE.

1032
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:41,751
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

1033
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:42,852
I'LL KICK HER ASS.

1034
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,320
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

1035
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,022
- JOEL, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

1036
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:48,224
I HAVE 200 YEARS
OF EUROPEAN HISTORY

1037
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,559
TO MEMORIZE BY MONDAY.

1038
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:52,195
- WHICH IS WHY
I AM GOING TO HELP YOU

1039
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:55,231
CONNECT THOSE BORING,
MUNDANE FACTS

1040
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,700
TO IDEAS THAT ARE
PERSONAL TO YOU.

1041
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,203
- HOW?

1042
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:02,071
- OKAY, CHAMPAGNE.

1043
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,940
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
WHEN YOU DRINK CHAMPAGNE?

1044
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:06,042
- OLD PEOPLE, HEADACHES.

1045
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,177
- OKAY, PERFECT,
LET'S GO WITH HEADACHES.

1046
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,846
CHAMPAGNE IS FROM FRANCE.

1047
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:13,950
IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED
IN THE CORONATION OF KINGS.

1048
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:18,254
KING LOUIS XVI
ALSO GOT A HEADACHE

1049
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:21,257
WHEN HE WAS BEHEADED
BY HIS OWN SUBJECTS

1050
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:24,460
ON JANUARY 21ST, 1793,

1051
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:27,997
DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.

1052
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,232
- NOT BAD.
- YEAH.

1053
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:30,566
- JUST LETTING YOU KNOW

1054
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:33,236
I'M CHANGING THE ATMOSPHERE UP
A BIT.

1055
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,942
WHY IS MY ASS GETTING HOT?

1056
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,145
- SEAT WARMERS!

1057
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,647
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1058
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,883
- WELL, ANYWAY,
A FEW MNEMONIC DEVICES

1059
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,318
WON'T BE ENOUGH TO GET ME AN "A"
IN DRAPER'S CLASS.

1060
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,288
- YOU KNEW ABOUT
MNEMONIC DEVICES?

1061
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,891
- WHAT I DON'T KNOW
IS WHAT TO STUDY.

1062
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:58,494
DRAPER'S CRAMMING WAY TOO MANY
CHAPTERS INTO ONE TEST.

1063
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,664
- WELL, I DON'T GO BACK
TO CORNELL

1064
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:06,436
UNTIL SUNDAY, SO...

1065
00:45:06,438 --> 00:45:10,239
- AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ACTUALLY GONNA HELP ME STUDY.

1066
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:13,943
PULL OVER.
- WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON.

1067
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,712
HOLD ON.

1068
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,649
WOULD THIS HELP?

1069
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,821
- YOU HAVE THE TEST?

1070
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:28,357
- DRAPER USES THE SAME PASSWORD
FOR ALL HIS SECURE FILES.

1071
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,694
IT'S "ARIANA GRANDE'S
PUFFY NIPPLES 555."

1072
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:34,797
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
LEAD WITH THIS

1073
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,933
INSTEAD OF THE LAME MNEMONIC?

1074
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,569
- WELL, ONCE YOU HAD
THE ACTUAL TEST,

1075
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:43,106
THERE'D BE NO REASON
FOR YOU TO HANG OUT WITH ME.

1076
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:45,141
- JOEL.

1077
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,676
I STILL WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH YOU.

1078
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:50,413
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LEAD YOU ON.

1079
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,949
LIKE, NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN
BETWEEN US.

1080
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,117
- FUCK!

1081
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,718
- NO, DUH, I KNOW THAT.

1082
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,953
- YEAH.
- SURE.

1083
00:45:56,955 --> 00:46:01,924
- SERIOUSLY, LIKE,
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

1084
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,292
- OKAY, WHAT IF YOU AND I

1085
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,328
WERE STUCK ON
A DESERTED ISLAND TOGETHER

1086
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,696
AND YOU WERE GETTING
SUPER HORNY.

1087
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:08,397
YOU'RE DIDDLING YOURSELF
EVERY NIGHT, SURE.

1088
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,666
BUT WHAT YOU REALLY NEED
IS A PENIS.

1089
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,602
NOW, YOU'RE THINKING,
"I'LL GO ARTIFICIAL."

1090
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,403
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DILDO,
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DILDO.

1091
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:15,938
YOU'RE SEARCHING THE ISLAND.
YOU CAN'T FIND ONE.

1092
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,406
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU SEE ME.

1093
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,308
I JUST GAVE MYSELF
A NICE LITTLE SALTWATER BATH.

1094
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,843
I LOOK GREAT.

1095
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:22,011
I SHOOT YOU A WINK.

1096
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,880
WHAT ARE MY CHANCES?

1097
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,248
- WELL, IN THAT SCENARIO,

1098
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,850
I GUESS YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT.

1099
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,596
ALMONT?

1100
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,965
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO EAT HERE.

1101
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:46,235
- WHAT A LUCKY GUESS.

1102
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,171
- BUT I'M NOT DRESSED FOR THIS.

1103
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:50,406
- I GOT IT COVERED.

1104
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,358
A-VOOGA-VOOGA!

1105
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,860
HEH-LA-LA-LA!

1106
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,261
YES, PLEASE.

1107
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,663
I'M KIDDING.

1108
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,731
BUT SERIOUSLY,
YOU LOOK REALLY FUCKING GOOD.

1109
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,168
- JOEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GOT ME THIS DRESS.

1110
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,970
I'VE WANTED IT FOR SO LONG.

1111
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,271
- REALLY?
NO WAY.

1112
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:23,739
MY GOD, BABY.

1113
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:28,077
WHO KNEW OUR TASTES
WERE SO SYMPATICO?

1114
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,545
- JOEL...

1115
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,615
- ONLY ON A DILDO-LESS
ABANDONED ISLAND, I KNOW.

1116
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,227
- FUCK.

1117
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,128
I THINK I BROKE MY VAGINA.

1118
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,232
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD AS HELL
WHEN YOU'RE HIGH?

1119
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:50,333
- WHAT?

1120
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:51,601
- MOTHERFUCKIN' FRENCH FRIES.

1121
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:56,205
I CAN ONLY BURP LIKE THAT
WHEN I'M HIGH.

1122
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,140
- CLASSY.

1123
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,976
OKAY.

1124
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,178
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

1125
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,312
- YOU'RE A LESBIAN?

1126
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:04,480
- WHAT?
NO.

1127
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,649
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?

1128
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,951
- YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT MADE ME BUY CHARLENE.

1129
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,853
- MY GOD, YOU NAMED HER?

1130
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:11,988
- YEAH.

1131
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,323
I EVEN GAVE HER A BACKSTORY.

1132
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,726
SHE'S HAD A HELL
OF A YEAR, CHARLENE.

1133
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:17,827
ABUSIVE HUSBAND.

1134
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:20,062
CHILDREN DIED
IN A PLANE CRASH.

1135
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,265
WENT TO REHAB A FEW TIMES.

1136
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:23,566
EVEN TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.

1137
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:24,567
- AW.

1138
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:25,735
- BUT SHE'S BOUNCING BACK.

1139
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,871
ONE DAY AT A TIME,
RIGHT, CHARLENE?

1140
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,040
- YOU'RE NOT HIGH.

1141
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:32,408
- WHAT?

1142
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,210
- THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO TELL YOU.

1143
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:36,879
I JUST GAVE YOU
A PLAIN OLD BROWNIE.

1144
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,482
THERE WAS NO WEED IN IT.

1145
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:41,951
- WAS IT EVEN GLUTEN-FREE?

1146
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,085
YOU BITCH.

1147
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,654
- I'M SORRY.

1148
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,255
MY GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK GLUTEN IS,

1149
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,757
TO BE HONEST.

1150
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,225
- THE NATION'S LEADING KILLER,
AT THE MOMENT.

1151
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:50,860
- BULLSHIT.
- YEAH.

1152
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,161
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

1153
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,063
IF I'M NOT HIGH, THEN HOW
DO YOU EXPLAIN THE FACT

1154
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:55,998
THAT I'VE BEEN REALLY FUCKING
HIGH FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS?

1155
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,266
- IT'S A PLACEBO EFFECT.

1156
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,567
YOU HAD THIS PRECONCEIVED NOTION

1157
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,070
OF HOW YOU WOULD RESPOND
TO THE BROWNIE,

1158
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,438
SO WHEN YOU ATE THE BROWNIE,

1159
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,906
YOUR BRAIN
AUTOMATICALLY RESPONDED

1160
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:08,010
AS IF THE CHEMICAL REACTION
WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

1161
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:09,946
- YOU FAKE-DRUGGED ME?

1162
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,783
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
- IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

1163
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,117
- NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S FUCKED UP.

1164
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,352
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1165
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,454
THEN I GUESS
PAYBACK'S A BITCH,

1166
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,455
AND WE'RE EVEN.

1167
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,890
- EVEN FOR WHAT?

1168
00:49:20,892 --> 00:49:22,391
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
THIS FUCKED-UP TO YOU.

1169
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:25,094
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1170
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,429
- HERE WE GO.

1171
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,698
- YEAH, HERE WE GO.

1172
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,433
YEAH.

1173
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,868
- HEY, I TOOK THAT.

1174
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,371
IT'S ACTUALLY ONE
OF MY FAVORITE SHOTS.

1175
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,273
I LOVE THE WAY THE LIGHT
HITS YOUR HAIR.

1176
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:38,507
SEE THE NATURAL COMPOSITION--

1177
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:39,875
- FUCK YOUR COMPOSITION.

1178
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:41,711
THAT WAS MY LIFE
THAT YOU WERE PHOTOGRAPHING.

1179
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:44,180
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHEN THAT WAS TAKEN?

1180
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:45,181
- PROM.

1181
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:46,615
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

1182
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:49,185
THE NIGHT THAT THAT ASSHOLE
FROM MURRYSVILLE

1183
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:50,486
WHO TOOK MY VIRGINITY

1184
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,288
DECIDED TO STAND ME UP
AND TELL ME

1185
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,390
THAT I WAS JUST HIS DUMB
LITTLE SLAM-PIG

1186
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:57,994
WHOM HE WOULDN'T BE SEEN
IN PUBLIC WITH.

1187
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:58,995
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

1188
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,396
- YEAH, NO, NOBODY KNEW.

1189
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:01,831
BUT YOU STILL WENT
AND YOU POSTED THE PICTURE

1190
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,599
LIKE IT'S JUST
NO BIG FUCKING DEAL,

1191
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,102
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE

1192
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:08,004
TO BE A LOSER.

1193
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:15,911
- YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET?

1194
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:17,613
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
ON A FRIDAY

1195
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:21,384
I'VE ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING
IN, LIKE, MONTHS.

1196
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:23,386
YOU KNOW WHAT I USUALLY DO
ON FRIDAYS?

1197
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,621
I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

1198
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:29,058
I GET HOME FROM CLASS,
LAY IN BED,

1199
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,426
AND I MASTURBATE,

1200
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:33,963
LIKE, VICIOUSLY,

1201
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,464
LIKE, FOR FIVE HOURS,

1202
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,033
LIKE A MARATHON.

1203
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,701
GOD!

1204
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,169
- AND THEN I GO TO THE FRIDGE,

1205
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:44,974
AND I GET A BUNCH OF FOOD,
AND I EAT MY FEELINGS.

1206
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:47,643
THEN I GO TO SLEEP.

1207
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:50,012
EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT.

1208
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,450
I HATE COLLEGE.

1209
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:55,785
I FUCKING HATE IT.

1210
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:56,986
I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.

1211
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:57,987
I HATE MY CLASSES.

1212
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,055
I HATE MY PROFESSORS.

1213
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:01,524
THEY SUCK THE FUN
OUT OF EVERYTHING.

1214
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:02,725
I'M FAILING EVERY CLASS.

1215
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,627
I'M FAILING YOGA.

1216
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:07,763
HOW DO YOU FAIL YOGA?

1217
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,865
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST PART
OF EVERYTHING IS?

1218
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:13,436
THIS WHOLE TIME WE'VE BEEN
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION,

1219
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,171
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW HAPPY I AM

1220
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,773
TO BE IN THIS GYM,

1221
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,576
BECAUSE...

1222
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,145
I FUCKING MISS HIGH SCHOOL
SO BAD.

1223
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:29,118
- AND WE WILL CUE
THE CW SOUNDTRACK...

1224
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,953
RIGHT THERE.

1225
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:31,787
- I MEAN, REALLY?

1226
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:32,988
WE WERE HAVING A NICE MOMENT.

1227
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,425
YOU GOT TO BE A BITCH?

1228
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,228
- NO, HONESTLY, THOUGH,

1229
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,796
I THINK THAT HEATHER DUMPING YOU

1230
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:45,468
IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

1231
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,469
THINK ABOUT IT.

1232
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:48,003
SHE WAS GIVING YOU

1233
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:50,206
A REASON TO RESIST
YOUR NEW ENVIRONMENT.

1234
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,075
SHE WAS GIVING YOU AN EXCUSE
TO HATE IT.

1235
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,478
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE SCHOOL
A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT BETTER

1236
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,513
WHEN YOU GO BACK.

1237
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:01,750
OKAY, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
WE NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW,

1238
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:03,719
BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND
THIS GYM MUCH LONGER.

1239
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,521
I PROMISED MYSELF
THE ONLY WAY I WOULD COME BACK

1240
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,123
IS IF I HAD TELEKINETIC POWERS,

1241
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:10,426
AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED TODAY,
SO LET'S GO.

1242
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,628
- ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M DRIVING.

1243
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,729
- WHAT?
WHY?

1244
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:15,931
- I KNOW COOL PLACES TOO.

1245
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,570
- YOU'RE NOT HIGH,
BUT YOU STILL CAN'T CATCH.

1246
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,578
- DAD'S DEAD!

1247
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,046
DAD'S DEAD.

1248
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:33,115
YO, MY DAD'S DEAD, DAD'S DEAD.

1249
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:35,951
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LIKE
<i>WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?</i>

1250
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:37,586
I THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONLY ONE.

1251
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:38,854
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1252
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,823
OKAY, LITERALLY,
THE ONLY THING HOTTER

1253
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,992
THAN LEONARDO DICAPRIO
IS, LIKE,

1254
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:46,762
A RETARDED LEONARDO DICAPRIO
WEARING A FUCKING SEXY DIAPER.

1255
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:50,199
- THAT SHIT
MAKES ME SO WET.

1256
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:53,936
OKAY, GOOD.

1257
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:59,575
HEY, DO YOU WANT
TO GET RETARDED WITH ME?

1258
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,076
- WHAT'S THAT?

1259
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,611
- IT'S ETHYL.

1260
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,848
IT'S LIKE MOLLY MIXED
WITH BRAN MUFFIN

1261
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,416
AND PRUNE JUICE OR SOMETHING.

1262
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,417
I HEAR IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE--

1263
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,885
- TOTES CRAY?

1264
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,788
- EXACTLY.

1265
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,424
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU LOVED THIS STUFF.

1266
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:19,094
- WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IMPRESSION?

1267
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,529
- I--

1268
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,331
- YOU FACEBOOK STALKED ME.

1269
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,632
- WHAT?

1270
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,367
- LACY POSTED THAT
STUPID SHIT ON MY WALL,

1271
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,535
LIKE, SIX HOURS AGO,

1272
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,770
ABOUT GETTING FUCKED UP
ON ETHYL.

1273
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:28,804
- WHAT IS FACEBOOK?

1274
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:29,805
IS THAT A WEBSITE?

1275
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,240
- IN FACT, THIS WHOLE NIGHT

1276
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,676
HAS BEEN A LITTLE TOO PERFECT,
HASN'T IT?

1277
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:35,411
THE RESTAURANT, THE DRESS,

1278
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,646
OUR--OUR NONSTOP CONVERSATION.

1279
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,315
- THE CONVERSATION WAS ALL ME.

1280
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:40,382
- REALLY?

1281
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,884
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF WEIRD

1282
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:45,321
THAT ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE THINGS
ARE THE SAME AS MINE.

1283
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:48,023
DO YOU EVEN LIKE
<i>WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?</i>

1284
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:49,258
- THAT WAS TRUE.

1285
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,694
THAT FAT MOM BEING LIT ON FIRE
AT THE END?

1286
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:52,962
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL!

1287
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:54,763
KILLED ME.

1288
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,468
OKAY, FINE.

1289
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,503
FINE, ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT?

1290
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:02,705
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

1291
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,306
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A SPECIAL TIME.

1292
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:05,641
IS THAT A CRIME?
AM I IN TROUBLE?

1293
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,009
ARE YOU GONNA YELL AT ME?

1294
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:08,944
I MEAN, I GOT ONE CHANCE
TO TAKE YOU ON A DATE,

1295
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:10,412
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE--

1296
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,282
- I SAID NO.

1297
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:17,386
I THINK IT'S REALLY SWEET
YOU TRIED TO IMPRESS ME.

1298
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:18,387
- YOU DO?

1299
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:19,388
- YEAH.

1300
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,556
I MEAN, NOBODY CARES

1301
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:22,524
ABOUT WHAT I THINK
OR WHAT I LIKE.

1302
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:23,859
- BUT I DON'T GET IT.

1303
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,160
IF YOU'RE NOT
INTO THIS ETHYL STUFF,

1304
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:27,263
THEN WHY DID YOU "LIKE"
LACY'S POST?

1305
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:30,266
- I DON'T LIKE
HALF THE STUFF I "LIKE."

1306
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,269
IT'S JUST EASIER
TO GO ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.

1307
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:40,175
THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

1308
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,245
IT WAS REALLY RETARDED,

1309
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:46,615
IN A GOOD WAY.

1310
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,085
- WELL, I'VE GOT ONE MORE STOP.

1311
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:52,254
AND I PROMISE THIS
IS GONNA BE SOMETHING

1312
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,923
YOU'LL ACTUALLY "LIKE."

1313
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,564
I GOT THREE WORDS:

1314
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:05,801
DI-A-RRHEA.

1315
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,203
AM I RIGHT?

1316
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:09,672
SLAM DUNK!

1317
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,008
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

1318
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,945
- ALMOST THERE, DOWN THE STEPS
TO YOUR DEEP, DARK BASEMENT

1319
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:19,214
WHERE YOU'LL CHOP MY BODY UP
INTO A MILLION PIECES,

1320
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:20,783
REVEAL THAT YOU'RE
A SERIAL KILLER,

1321
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:23,919
AND WEAR MY SKIN UNTIL YOU DIE?

1322
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,722
- NO, BUT I WILL DO THAT
ON OUR SECOND DATE.

1323
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:28,057
- GREAT.

1324
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,725
- THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
MORE AWESOME.

1325
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,599
SERIOUSLY?

1326
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,001
- YEAH, COOL, RIGHT?

1327
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,370
- MY GOD, HOW DID YOU
EVEN GET IN HERE?

1328
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:42,838
- I HAVE CONNECTIONS.

1329
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,141
SECURITY GUARD WAS IN MY
COMMUNITY PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS.

1330
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:51,280
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
EVEN BEEN HERE.

1331
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:52,448
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1332
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:55,451
- I USED TO COME HERE,
LIKE, EVERY SUNDAY.

1333
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:56,652
- REALLY, YOU?

1334
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:57,886
'CAUSE I NEVER PEGGED YOU

1335
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,755
FOR THE PROTOTYPICAL
FOOTBALL FAN.

1336
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:00,856
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1337
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:01,990
- NO, I LOVE THE FOOTBALL.

1338
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,625
- YOU LOVE <i>THE</i> FOOTBALL?

1339
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:05,828
- YEAH.
- YES.

1340
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,763
WELL, MR. FOOTBALL MAN,

1341
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:11,900
HOW MANY POINTS DOES ONE GET
FOR A TOUCHDOWN?

1342
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:14,336
- HERE, WAIT,
LET ME THINK.

1343
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,205
- NICE, GOOD.

1344
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:17,473
YEAH, AWESOME.

1345
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,741
- WAIT, ALMOST GOT IT.

1346
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:20,509
- THAT'S THE ONE
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

1347
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,111
PERFECT FORM.

1348
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:23,512
WELL DONE.

1349
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,280
- ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

1350
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:26,315
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW

1351
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,150
IS THEY GOT SOME
BOMB-ASS HOTDOGS HERE.

1352
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,619
AND THE BATHROOMS ARE
WAY CLEANER THAN YOU'D EXPECT.

1353
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:31,887
- CLASSY.
- YEAH.

1354
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,188
- CLASSY STADIUM.

1355
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,556
- YEAH, WE USED TO
COME HERE EVERY WEEKEND.

1356
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,858
MY MOM WAS A BIG FAN,

1357
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,395
SO THIS WAS USUALLY
THE FAMILY OUTING.

1358
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,904
- I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR MOM BEFORE.

1359
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,807
IT WAS CANCER, RIGHT?

1360
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:53,642
- NO, ACTUALLY,
SHE WAS A SAGITTARIUS.

1361
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,377
WHAT'S YOUR MOM?

1362
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,751
YEAH, SHE PASSED AWAY
A FEW YEARS AGO.

1363
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,219
CAN WE ACTUALLY SKIP
THIS WHOLE

1364
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,921
"HOW DID IT FEEL
WHEN SHE DIED?" THING?

1365
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,489
I HAVE DONE THAT WITH
SO MANY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS.

1366
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:08,424
I AM GOOD.

1367
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:09,892
- YEAH, NO, I MEAN,

1368
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,393
I WAS ALREADY GETTING BORED,

1369
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:13,595
SO I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT WE'RE MOVING ON.

1370
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,730
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1371
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,599
- AWESOME.

1372
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,235
- SO, UM...

1373
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:23,772
WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER
TO TALK ABOUT?

1374
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,275
- ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW THE OTHER NIGHT

1375
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:28,577
WHEN YOU SAID
IT WAS "JUST SEX"?

1376
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,549
- WAS THAT, LIKE "JUST SEX"
ONE TIME,

1377
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:37,653
OR COULD WE JUST HAVE "JUST SEX"

1378
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,222
JUST AGAIN?

1379
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,424
- FROM THE DEAD MOM TO SEX.

1380
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:46,795
THAT IS A VERY IMPRESSIVELY
SMOOTH SEGUE THERE, ROMEO.

1381
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,231
- I'D SAY IT'S A TOUCHDOWN.

1382
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:50,332
- YEAH, AWESOME.

1383
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:51,900
IT'S NOT REAL WITHOUT THE DANCE.

1384
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,202
OKAY, THERE IT IS.

1385
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:56,872
THERE YOU GO, YEAH, NICE.

1386
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:59,007
- NO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

1387
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:01,343
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION.

1388
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:10,552
- SHIT!

1389
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:11,920
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

1390
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,555
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE,
LIKE, ROMANTIC.

1391
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:14,590
MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?

1392
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:15,591
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

1393
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:16,592
- YOU OKAY?

1394
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:17,593
- I THINK I TASTE BLOOD.

1395
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:18,594
- SHIT.

1396
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:19,795
- I THINK I TASTE BLOOD.

1397
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:28,403
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE.

1398
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,472
- SO YOU BROUGHT ME
TO A PLACE

1399
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:34,209
I'VE BEEN TO
A BILLION TIMES BEFORE?

1400
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,944
- HIT IT.

1401
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:43,785
- ¶ WHATEVER IT TAKES ¶

1402
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,554
¶ YOU KNOW I CAN
MAKE IT THROUGH ¶

1403
00:58:45,556 --> 00:58:47,856
- <i>DEGRASSI?</i>

1404
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,659
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW
GROWING UP.

1405
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,261
- I KNOW.

1406
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,963
YOU PERFORMED THE THEME SONG
AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL TALENT SHOW

1407
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,398
THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

1408
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,535
- MY FAVORITE EPISODE
IS WHEN JIMMY GETS SHOT.

1409
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:03,138
NO, WHERE EMMA GETS GONORRHEA
IN HER THROAT.

1410
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,172
NO!

1411
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:06,775
WHEN SPINNER
GETS BALLSACK CANCER.

1412
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:08,610
MY GOD, SO SAD.

1413
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:11,413
I ALMOST CRIED.

1414
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:14,583
- JESUS, THAT SHOW
IS, LIKE, REALLY FUCKED UP.

1415
00:59:14,585 --> 00:59:15,884
- I KNOW.

1416
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,454
IT GOES THERE.

1417
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,026
- ALL RIGHT, AND WE'RE
GONNA SLOW IT DOWN

1418
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:27,162
WITH THE AFTER-THE-CREDITS
VERSION.

1419
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:32,134
- WE HAVE TO DANCE.

1420
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:33,902
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

1421
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,271
- YES, YOU DO KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

1422
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,706
COME ON.

1423
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:38,707
PUT YOUR HANDS HERE.

1424
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:39,875
- OKAY.

1425
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:41,743
- AND THEN I PUT MY HANDS
UP HERE.

1426
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,579
AND NOW WE JUST SWAY.

1427
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:44,580
- SWAY.

1428
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,181
- SWAY, SWAY.

1429
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,015
- OKAY.

1430
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,617
- MOVE YOUR HIPS.

1431
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,152
- BUT I DON'T WANT
TO STEP ON YOUR FEET.

1432
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:51,920
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA STEP
ON MY FEET.

1433
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:52,921
CHILLAX.

1434
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,089
- BUT IT COULD HAPPEN.

1435
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,091
- THAT'S GOOD, JOEL-SKI.

1436
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,092
- YOU'RE LYING.

1437
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,093
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING.

1438
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,028
- I'M NOT LYING.

1439
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,255
- MY GOD.

1440
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,590
THIS IS JUST LIKE THE EPISODE
WHERE CLARE LEFT ELI

1441
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,193
BECAUSE SHE FOUND OUT
HE WAS BIPOLAR.

1442
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,454
- WHAT'S WRONG?

1443
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:01,757
- NOTHING.

1444
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:02,891
- YOU NERVOUS?

1445
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:04,393
- NO.

1446
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:05,894
- I MEAN, WE'VE KIND OF
ALREADY DONE THIS BEFORE.

1447
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:06,995
- YEAH, IT'S JUST THIS TIME

1448
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,731
I'M NOT COVERED IN PUKE.

1449
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,739
- YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
YOU KNOW THAT?

1450
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,677
YOU ALWAYS WERE.

1451
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,730
- SHIT.

1452
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:48,170
MY GOD.

1453
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:51,406
SHIT, IS IT 6:00 ALREADY?

1454
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,008
I PROMISED I WOULD HELP SET UP

1455
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,777
FOR MY SISTER'S
ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

1456
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,847
HEY, DOES THIS SHIRT SAY, LIKE,

1457
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:01,550
"I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,
AND I DON'T GIVE A FUCK"?

1458
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,350
- YEAH.

1459
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:05,320
- AWESOME, PERFECT.

1460
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:08,156
YOU CAN COME IF YOU WANT TO.

1461
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,357
- REALLY?

1462
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,026
ALL RIGHT,
I LOVE ENGAGEMENT PARTIES.

1463
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:16,264
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT MAKE ME
REGRET FUCKING YOU.

1464
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,967
- HEY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

1465
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,202
ME AND YOU SHOULD GO
ON A ROAD TRIP.

1466
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:22,237
- WHAT, LIKE, OVER CHRISTMAS?

1467
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,005
- NO, LIKE, THIS WEEK.

1468
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:26,408
- I HAVE CLASSES ON MONDAY.

1469
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,744
- WELL, THEN YOU CAN
JUST SKIP THEM.

1470
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:31,713
- I CAN'T,
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

1471
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:35,751
- COME ON, WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE
AWESOME, YOU KNOW, LIKE...

1472
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:37,319
KENTUCKY.

1473
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:39,955
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOUR DOG THERE.

1474
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:42,290
- THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC,

1475
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:45,293
BUT DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME

1476
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:48,697
THAT YOU WERE, LIKE,
FLUNKING OUT OF SCHOOL?

1477
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:52,000
- I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO GO BACK ANYWAYS.

1478
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:55,203
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1479
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,773
- I JUST WANT TO STAY HERE,
YOU KNOW?

1480
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,407
WHY AM I GONNA GO BACK?

1481
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:02,077
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT ALL THIS
RANDOM SHIT IN YOUR TRUNK

1482
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:03,512
THAT WE CAN PLAY WITH.

1483
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:06,414
WE COULD HAVE SEX
IN PARKING LOTS EVERY NIGHT.

1484
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:08,817
- OKAY, YEAH,
I REALLY CAN'T TELL

1485
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:11,720
IF YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS
OR NOT RIGHT NOW.

1486
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,488
- DEAD.

1487
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,823
- NO.

1488
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,225
- COME ON, YOU ALREADY FORGET
ABOUT THE FUCK IT LIST?

1489
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:18,493
LET GO A LITTLE.

1490
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,495
- WOW, YOU COMPLETELY
MISINTERPRETED

1491
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:22,497
THE ENTIRE PURPOSE
OF THAT EXERCISE.

1492
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:25,267
- ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT I WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU MORE.

1493
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:27,636
SO WHY IS THAT SO BAD?

1494
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:31,239
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
LESSONS FROM THE LIST

1495
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,775
AND APPLY THEM TO
YOUR NEW LIFE IN NEW YORK.

1496
01:03:33,777 --> 01:03:36,111
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KICK ASS IN SCHOOL

1497
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:37,546
AND MEET NEW PEOPLE

1498
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,281
AND HAVE ALL
THESE GREAT EXPERIENCES.

1499
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,482
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RETREAT

1500
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:43,051
BACK TO WHATEVER
IS EASY FOR YOU.

1501
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,386
- COME ON.

1502
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:46,588
YOU WEREN'T THAT EASY.

1503
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,323
- REALLY, DUDE?

1504
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:51,927
- COME ON, I WAS KIDDING.

1505
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:52,961
- NO, IT'S--

1506
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:53,962
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S FINE.

1507
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:56,031
IT'S FINE.

1508
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:57,232
- CAN WE NOT END ON A FIGHT?

1509
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:58,300
- WE'RE NOT HAVING A FIGHT.

1510
01:03:58,302 --> 01:03:59,835
JUST, LIKE, CHILL OUT.

1511
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,269
I JUST HAVE TO GET BACK,

1512
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,771
SO JUST TELL ME
HOW TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE.

1513
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:04,039
- WHY?

1514
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,575
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO YOUR HOUSE FOR THE PARTY.

1515
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:11,913
- I--YEAH, I GOT TO CHECK
AND MAKE SURE THAT'S COOL.

1516
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,749
- YOU CAN JUST TAKE ROUTE 28.

1517
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,451
- OKAY.

1518
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,893
- WELL,
THAT'S THE LAST ONE, BOSS.

1519
01:04:24,895 --> 01:04:26,895
- THAT'S IT?

1520
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,630
WELL, I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD GO

1521
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:31,066
BEFORE CRACKHEADS
AND HOOKERS MOVE IN.

1522
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,038
- TOO LATE.

1523
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,940
- HEY, YOU MADE IT.

1524
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,826
- SO...

1525
01:04:57,828 --> 01:04:58,927
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

1526
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,829
DID YOU KISS ANY DUDES

1527
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:04,132
AND THEN RUN AWAY CRYING
AND LEAVING THEM STRANDED

1528
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,635
WITH A SHITTY TWO-PERSON BAND

1529
01:05:06,637 --> 01:05:10,005
TO TALK ABOUT THAT ONE TIME
THEY ALMOST GOT SIGNED?

1530
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:11,706
- JOEL, I LIKE YOU.

1531
01:05:12,843 --> 01:05:13,942
COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

1532
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:14,943
- AS A FRIEND.

1533
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:16,411
- PERFECT.

1534
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,380
- I'M SORRY I DON'T
LIKE YOU MORE THAN THAT.

1535
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:19,848
I WISH I DID.

1536
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,316
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,

1537
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:23,451
I'M ATTRACTED TO MUSCULAR,

1538
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,588
MORE CONVENTIONALLY
ATTRACTIVE MEN.

1539
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,889
- THAT'S NOT NICE.

1540
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:29,090
WHY ARE YOU SAYING--

1541
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,592
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE
MAKING ME FEEL BETTER?

1542
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,927
- I ALMOST SLEPT WITH YOU
LAST NIGHT.

1543
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,596
- AGAIN, NOT MAKING ME
FEEL BETTER.

1544
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,332
- JOEL, I WANTED YOU
TO BE MY FRIEND.

1545
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,600
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

1546
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,802
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO TALK TO.

1547
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,203
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1548
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:44,139
YOU'RE, LIKE, YOU.

1549
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:45,640
YOU'RE SUPER POPULAR.

1550
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:48,076
- YEAH, WITH PEOPLE
I'M NEVER GOING TO TALK TO

1551
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:49,744
ONCE I GRADUATE.

1552
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:53,415
MANDY, STACY, AND LACY
ARE TOTES RETAR.

1553
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:56,284
MY BROTHER'S
A SELF-ABSORBED ASSHOLE.

1554
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,854
EVEN MY DAD PREFERS
TALKING TO YOU OVER ME.

1555
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,923
I FEEL COMFORTABLE
AROUND YOU, JOEL.

1556
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,225
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
AND FOR SOME REASON,

1557
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:06,561
YOU LIKE ME FOR WHO I AM.

1558
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:08,330
I DIDN'T WANT
TO THROW THAT ALL AWAY

1559
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:10,932
BY HAVING MEANINGLESS SEX.

1560
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,569
AM I MAKING SENSE?

1561
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,306
THANK YOU.

1562
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,541
I FELT SO BAD.

1563
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:21,910
I'M SORRY I ABANDONED YOU.

1564
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,044
- IT'S OKAY.

1565
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:24,479
TO BE FAIR,
YOU WARNED ME AHEAD OF TIME

1566
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,548
THAT YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED.

1567
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,850
- WELL, YOU WERE PRETTY HARD
TO DISCOURAGE.

1568
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:29,951
- I KNOW.

1569
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:31,419
I GUESS I JUST WANTED
MY FIRST TIME

1570
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,922
TO BE WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL.

1571
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:34,923
- FIRST TIME?

1572
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:36,157
- NO.

1573
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,659
I MEAN MY 17TH TIME.

1574
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,562
I WANTED MY 17TH TIME
TO BE WITH SOMEONE SPECIAL,

1575
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:42,998
BECAUSE THAT'S--
THAT'S MY LUCKY NUMBER.

1576
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,933
THAT, AND 69,

1577
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:47,836
BECAUSE OF... ORAL SEX.

1578
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,372
- THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

1579
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:53,274
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE.

1580
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:54,943
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR TUMBLR?

1581
01:06:54,945 --> 01:06:56,611
- I MADE THAT UP.

1582
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:59,881
ONLY BOOBS I'VE EVER SEEN
ARE MY MOM'S.

1583
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,184
JOEL!

1584
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,352
I'M SORRY.

1585
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,387
I'M SORRY; THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

1586
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:06,454
- NO, IT IS.

1587
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:07,722
MY MOM'S TITTIES ARE HILARIOUS.

1588
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,362
WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,
WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

1589
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,398
- SHOULD WE GET BRACELETS?

1590
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,734
- I WAS THINKING
I'D GET YOU LAID.

1591
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,736
FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS
STAY VIRGINS,

1592
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,271
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW A TRIO

1593
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:28,009
OF OVERLY PROMISCUOUS,
EASILY IMPRESSIONABLE LADIES.

1594
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:29,978
- SO YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO PIMP THEM OUT?

1595
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,413
REALLY?

1596
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:33,481
- YES.

1597
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,983
- OKAY, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

1598
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:36,251
- JOEL-SKI.

1599
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:37,452
- JANIE.

1600
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,121
- SORRY.

1601
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:42,457
I DIDN'T--OKAY.

1602
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:51,800
- AT LEAST TURN OFF
YOUR SEND RECEIPT FEATURE.

1603
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:55,270
I MEAN, COME ON!

1604
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:56,838
- HEY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED

1605
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,475
TO BE AT SHAREEF'S
CRAZY RAGER TONIGHT?

1606
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:01,876
YEAH, I KNOW SHIT.

1607
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:05,313
- NAH, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

1608
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:06,414
- COME ON.

1609
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,549
GO ON OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN.

1610
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,917
JUST DON'T DO MARIA.

1611
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:09,951
- WHO?

1612
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:11,086
- MARIA.

1613
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:12,320
IT'S MOLLY.

1614
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:13,354
LITTLE BIT OF CHILI,

1615
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:14,889
LITTLE BIT OF CAYENNE PEPPER.

1616
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,491
<i>MUY CALIENTE.</i>

1617
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:19,194
I TOLD YOU I KNOW SHIT.

1618
01:08:21,031 --> 01:08:25,033
All: CHUG, CHUG, CHUG,
CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG, CHUG!

1619
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:27,435
TORI THE WHORIE?

1620
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,770
- DON'T CALL HER THAT.

1621
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:32,407
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU HAD SEX WITH HER.

1622
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:34,409
- WHAT THE FUCK!

1623
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:35,844
- OOH.

1624
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:36,878
- HER?

1625
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,279
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU HAD SEX

1626
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,281
WITH THAT BUTTER-EVERYTHING?

1627
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,117
- DID SOMEBODY SAY, "BUTTER"?

1628
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:44,953
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

1629
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:45,987
- HEY!

1630
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:49,023
MENTAL ILLNESS
IS NOTHING TO LAUGH AT.

1631
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:50,725
IT'S PERSONAL!

1632
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:56,097
- THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME!

1633
01:08:58,268 --> 01:08:59,934
- HEATHER, STOP.

1634
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,237
- YEAH, YOU BETTER RUN, BITCH!

1635
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,139
- I DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH HER.

1636
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,040
- YOU DIDN'T?

1637
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:10,145
SCOTTY,
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

1638
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,980
FOR REALS, BOO.

1639
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:14,716
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

1640
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:26,961
- I'M NOT AFRAID TO BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF YOU, EITHER,

1641
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,897
MEGATRON.

1642
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:39,908
- STAN,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

1643
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,809
- STAN THE MAN.

1644
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:43,945
- ZACK, HOW NICE OF YOU
TO JOIN US.

1645
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:45,747
- ZACK ATTACK.

1646
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,882
- JENNIFER,
DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT?

1647
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:51,286
- NO, NO, SHE DIDN'T.

1648
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,987
WHOO.

1649
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:56,424
- SO YOU REALLY THINK
JANIE'S GONNA HOOK IT UP?

1650
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:57,492
- HELL YEAH.

1651
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:59,294
SHE GAVE ME HER WORD.

1652
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:00,428
FINALLY GONNA GET TO...

1653
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,631
¶ SEE SOME AREOLAS ¶

1654
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:08,836
- WHAT, IS IT SCOTT AGAIN?

1655
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,004
- YEAH, HE'S AT SHAREEF'S.

1656
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:12,040
HE JUST WANTED TO LET ME KNOW.

1657
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,675
- SO, WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA IGNORE HIM?

1658
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,276
- AFTER I GO BACK
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW,

1659
01:10:15,278 --> 01:10:18,379
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE THIS WEEKEND
NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

1660
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,816
- YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT.

1661
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:24,185
YOU ACTUALLY LIKE HIM.

1662
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:25,620
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

1663
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:27,722
BUT YOU HATE EVERYONE,

1664
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,090
LIKE, EVERYONE.

1665
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:30,058
YOU HATE MY GRANDMA,

1666
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,492
AND SHE BAKED YOU
A BIRTHDAY CAKE,

1667
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:34,128
AND SHE HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

1668
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,632
WHO'S THAT?

1669
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,634
- JOEL, I GOT TO GO.

1670
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,137
- ALL RIGHT, BYE, BITCH.

1671
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,774
- DAD TURNED MY ROOM
INTO A GYM.

1672
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:50,211
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SETTING UP A TRAP TO KILL ME.

1673
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:53,581
- WOW, I ACTUALLY NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT.

1674
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,950
WEIRD.

1675
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:01,689
SO, WHY DID YOU LEAVE
YOUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

1676
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,258
DID EVERYONE GET
EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA

1677
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,392
AND HAVE TO GO HOME?

1678
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:06,227
- NO, WHY WOULD THAT HAPPEN?

1679
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,395
- I DON'T KNOW.

1680
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:09,264
I MEAN, BIG PUNCHBOWL,
NO ONE GUARDING IT.

1681
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:10,398
THINGS HAPPEN.

1682
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,532
- NO, I JUST NEEDED A BREAK.

1683
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:12,934
I MEAN, I LOVE THE FAMILY,

1684
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,936
BUT SOMETIMES
THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY.

1685
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,271
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1686
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:17,739
- YES.

1687
01:11:17,741 --> 01:11:21,276
MY GOD, I RELATED TO
A SOLID HALF OF THAT STATEMENT.

1688
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,711
- SO WHY AREN'T YOU
AT SHAREEF'S PARTY?

1689
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,281
- WAIT, HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

1690
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,915
- SIXTH SENSE.

1691
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:30,785
- DON'T YOU MEAN, LIKE,
A FIFTH--

1692
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,120
YOU KNOW, NEVER MIND.

1693
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:33,254
TOO EASY.

1694
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:35,089
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW
THAT SCOTT LIKES YOU.

1695
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,424
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S TOO BAD,

1696
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,960
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM.

1697
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:42,430
- YES, YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.

1698
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:44,666
- OKAY, FINE, I LIKE HIM.

1699
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:45,667
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1700
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:46,868
IT'S COMPLICATED.

1701
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,169
HE'S COMPLICATED.

1702
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:49,470
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE'S SIMPLE.

1703
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,638
HE'S FAR TOO SIMPLE,

1704
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,274
AND SO SCARED OF EVERYTHING.

1705
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:56,144
I MEAN, I WAS SO CLOSE
TO FIXING HIM.

1706
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,247
HE WAS SO FUCKING CLOSE
TO BEING--

1707
01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:00,248
- JUST LIKE YOU.

1708
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,482
- WITH A PENIS!

1709
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,051
- HE'S NOT YOUR PROJECT, TORI.

1710
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:04,819
YOU CAN'T FORCE HIM
TO BE SOMETHING HE ISN'T.

1711
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,922
YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT HIM
FOR WHO HE IS.

1712
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:10,792
MY GOD,
HOW DO YOU ACCEPT GIL?

1713
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:11,859
- I DRINK A LOT.

1714
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:13,428
I'M ACTUALLY NOT EVEN BLIND.

1715
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,797
I'M JUST IN A CONSTANT STATE
OF BLACKOUT DRUNKNESS.

1716
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:23,504
GOD, WE HAVE FAR MORE IN COMMON
THAT I THOUGHT.

1717
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,140
- I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE GONNA
GROW UP TO BE BEAUTIFUL, TORI,

1718
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:30,244
AND THAT YOU WERE GONNA HAVE TO
BEAT THE BOYS AWAY WITH A STICK.

1719
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:33,247
JUST DON'T BEAT THEM ALL AWAY.

1720
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:40,822
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU,

1721
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:42,490
SO LEAVE A MESSAGE,
MOTHER-.

1722
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:44,158
- FUCK.

1723
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,829
- I WON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER, SCOTT.

1724
01:12:47,831 --> 01:12:48,830
- HEATHER?

1725
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,331
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1726
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,999
- I FOUND THIS
IN SHAREEF'S MOM'S CLOSET.

1727
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,901
ISN'T IT FUCKING HOT?

1728
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,537
IT'LL JINGLE
WHILE YOU FUCK ME.

1729
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,172
WHOO!

1730
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,610
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO DO ME, SCOTT.

1731
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:04,612
- I REALLY DON'T,
AND YOU'RE REALLY RACIST.

1732
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:05,680
MY GOD.

1733
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:08,282
- YOUR PENIS
NO NOT THINK SO.

1734
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:09,283
THANK YOU.

1735
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,718
COME AGAIN, PLEASE.

1736
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:13,654
GET IT?

1737
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,323
IT'S, LIKE, COME?

1738
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,691
- YEAH, NO, I GOT IT.

1739
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:20,128
- OOPS, LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN YOUR CAR.

1740
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:24,499
IT'S ALMOST BIG ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

1741
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:26,000
BOOP.

1742
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:29,036
GOD, I MISSED YOU
SO FUCKING MUCH.

1743
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:32,607
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE?

1744
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:35,209
- SORRY, I'M ON RIHANNA.

1745
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:38,312
IT'S MOLLY MIXED WITH STEROIDS
AND ADRENALINE.

1746
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,286
¶ ¶

1747
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:47,522
- SCOTT?

1748
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:48,656
SCOTT?

1749
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:49,957
HAS ANYONE SEEN SCOTT?

1750
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:51,392
- HE'S GETTING FINGERED
IN THE GARAGE.

1751
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:53,428
- I'M SORRY,
SCOTT IS GETTING FINGERED?

1752
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,296
- NO, BUT YOU ARE.

1753
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:56,831
- OKAY.

1754
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,599
HAS ANYONE SEEN SCOTT?

1755
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,834
- SCOTT IS HERE?

1756
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:01,035
I LOVE THAT GUY!

1757
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:03,404
EVERYBODY, SCOTT'S HERE!

1758
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,856
- YOU FUCKING MISS ME?

1759
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,391
- PLEASE, NO,
I DO NOT WANT THIS.

1760
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:24,392
- SHH.

1761
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:25,193
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1762
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:26,227
- PLEASE, NO, I HATE YOU.

1763
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,628
- I FUCKING LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

1764
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,830
- I FUCKING HATE YOU!

1765
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:30,798
- I FUCKING HATE YOU TOO!

1766
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,472
- MY GOD.

1767
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:43,277
THIS IS TOO GOOD.

1768
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,279
- TORI, WAIT.

1769
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:56,090
- YEAH, THAT ONE'S
DEFINITELY THE UGLIEST.

1770
01:14:57,861 --> 01:14:59,727
- TORI, WAIT.

1771
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:00,728
COME ON.

1772
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,864
- LET GO OF ME.

1773
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:04,065
- IT WASN'T WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE, OKAY?

1774
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:07,034
- NO, I CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.

1775
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:10,204
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT I LIKE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE,

1776
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:13,574
ONLY TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU ARE A FUCKING ASSHOLE!

1777
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:14,609
- IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

1778
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:15,943
HEATHER BASICALLY RAPED ME.

1779
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:18,412
- MY GOD,
SHE WEIGHS 90 POUNDS.

1780
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:21,282
- 87.

1781
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:25,686
- JUST STAY THE FUCK
AWAY FROM ME.

1782
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:28,289
TORI, WHORIE.

1783
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:31,425
TORI, WHORIE.

1784
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:33,528
TORI, WHORIE.

1785
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,630
TORI, WHORIE.

1786
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:37,598
TORI, WHORIE!

1787
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:43,804
WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE,
WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE,

1788
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:47,441
WHORIE, WHORIE, WHORIE!

1789
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:50,077
- SHE RAPED ME!

1790
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,693
- ALL RIGHT,
MY LITTLE SWEETHEARTS,

1791
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:07,495
NAME OF THE GAME
IS STRIP CUP.

1792
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:10,798
NOW, FOR EVERY MISS,
YOU HAVE TO...

1793
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,467
TAKE OFF AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING.

1794
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:14,735
- AND FOR EVERY MAKE,

1795
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,805
WE HAVE TO TAKE OFF
AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING TOO.

1796
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:19,440
YAY.

1797
01:16:19,442 --> 01:16:20,241
- IS SHE...

1798
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:21,642
- RETARDED?
YES.

1799
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:25,813
- SOMETIMES I DRINK BLEACH.

1800
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:28,516
- HEY, I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

1801
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:29,984
- I'M BUSY HERE.

1802
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:31,018
- WHAT, WITH STRIP CUP?

1803
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,553
COME ON, IT'S IMPORTANT.

1804
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:35,289
COME ON.

1805
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,492
OKAY, TORI'S REALLY PISSED
AT ME, AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

1806
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:39,894
- GO FUCK YOURSELF.

1807
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:41,829
- EXCUSE ME?

1808
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,364
- SHALL I REPEAT MYSELF?

1809
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,099
I THOUGHT I WAS CLEAR
THE FIRST TIME.

1810
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,201
- OKAY, WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A BITCH?

1811
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,537
I JUST NEED YOUR HELP.

1812
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:50,771
- IF I HAD TO GUESS,

1813
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,773
I'D PROBABLY SAY
TORI'S NOT TALKING TO YOU

1814
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,476
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY EVER
THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

1815
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:56,344
- THAT'S NOT IT.

1816
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:57,712
- WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?

1817
01:16:57,714 --> 01:17:00,414
THE DEPTH OF YOUR SELFISHNESS
IS ASTONISHING.

1818
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:02,850
HOW DARE YOU COME TO ME
FOR ADVICE?

1819
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:05,019
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE TRIED TALKING TO YOU

1820
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:06,520
BUT YOU WERE TOO BUSY FOR ME?

1821
01:17:06,522 --> 01:17:08,556
TOO BUSY WITH YOUR HAIR,
YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, OR HEATHER,

1822
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:10,324
WHATEVER BULLSHIT
WAS CONSUMING YOU AT THE TIME.

1823
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:11,892
- LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW, OKAY?

1824
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:13,194
YOU ALWAYS SEEM SO HAPPY.

1825
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:15,429
- WELL, THAT'S KIND OF
THE POINT.

1826
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:17,198
YOU'RE ONLY WORRYING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

1827
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,766
YOU'RE NOT AWARE
OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS,

1828
01:17:18,768 --> 01:17:22,436
LET ALONE YOUR ONLY SISTER.

1829
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:23,838
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, SCOTT.

1830
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,606
- WAIT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1831
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:26,607
- I'M HUGGING YOU.

1832
01:17:26,609 --> 01:17:27,708
- WHY?

1833
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,410
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD.

1834
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:30,211
- SCOTT, ENOUGH.

1835
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,813
THIS IS WAY TOO DISNEY CHANNEL.

1836
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,749
- YEAH, I DON'T CARE.

1837
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:35,750
COME ON.

1838
01:17:35,752 --> 01:17:37,518
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

1839
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:42,957
- I'M SORRY.

1840
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:44,759
I LOVE YOU.

1841
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:46,160
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

1842
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:50,264
- I KNEW YOU DID.

1843
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:52,967
SO, I'M A SELF-ABSORBED ASSHOLE,
RIGHT?

1844
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:54,769
- PRETTY MUCH.

1845
01:17:58,307 --> 01:17:59,807
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT.

1846
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:00,808
- YEAH, FEEL GOOD?

1847
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:01,809
- YEAH, IT FEELS GREAT.

1848
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:03,611
- OKAY, GOOD; GOOD FOR YOU.

1849
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:07,014
MY GOD.

1850
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,183
I KNOW WHAT I GOT TO DO
TO GET HER BACK.

1851
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,453
UNLESS YOU NEED ME
TO STAY HERE AND TALK ABOUT--

1852
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:13,254
- GO.

1853
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:14,255
- DO YOU WANT ANOTHER HUG?

1854
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:15,456
WE CAN HUG AGAIN.

1855
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,091
- GO, GO.

1856
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:22,496
- STACY GOT TIRED OF WAITING.

1857
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,568
- EXCUSE ME.

1858
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:31,939
- MATA!

1859
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,574
PITA?

1860
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:35,976
RUN!

1861
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,981
- NO!

1862
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:47,655
SORRY, MAN.

1863
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:08,209
- TAKE ME AS A HOSTAGE.

1864
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,878
- SCOTT, WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

1865
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,347
- THIS.

1866
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,792
- I'M A COMPLETE ASSHOLE.

1867
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,360
I'M SELFISH,

1868
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,329
I'M SELF-ABSORBED,

1869
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:31,532
AND I SUCK
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE TIME.

1870
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:35,202
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE JUST
STATING THE OBVIOUS.

1871
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:36,971
- BUT I WANT TO CHANGE.

1872
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:46,614
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE PROM PICTURE.

1873
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,849
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT HEATHER.

1874
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:52,153
AND I'M SORRY IF I EVER
MADE YOU FEEL LIKE...

1875
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,121
I WAS BETTER THAN YOU

1876
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:56,791
OR THAT YOU DIDN'T MATTER,

1877
01:19:56,793 --> 01:20:00,394
BECAUSE YOU DO, SO MUCH.

1878
01:20:06,736 --> 01:20:11,605
WHAT HAPPENED WITH HEATHER
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

1879
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:15,176
YESTERDAY WAS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

1880
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:17,178
AND I REALLY WISH IT WOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN ME SO LONG

1881
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,113
TO START MY FUCK IT LIST.

1882
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:20,114
- LANGUAGE.

1883
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:22,516
- YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP.

1884
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:25,553
- I KNOW THAT HATING EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE

1885
01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:29,557
IS KIND OF YOUR THING, BUT...

1886
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:33,194
GOD, I DON'T HATE YOU.

1887
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:36,263
- DAMN IT.

1888
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:38,833
I DON'T HATE YOU EITHER.

1889
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,814
MY GOD.

1890
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:56,417
YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE SHIT.

1891
01:20:58,321 --> 01:20:59,954
- I DON'T CARE.

1892
01:20:59,956 --> 01:21:01,689
- I DO.

1893
01:21:06,596 --> 01:21:07,795
- IT WAS RAPE, ALL RIGHT?

1894
01:21:07,797 --> 01:21:08,829
I SWEAR TO GOD.

1895
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:10,097
SHE TRICKED MY PENIS
INTO A BONER.

1896
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:12,733
- SHUT UP.

1897
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:19,573
ALL RIGHT.

1898
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:20,474
ALL DONE.

1899
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:22,743
- HOW DOES IT LOOK?

1900
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:26,080
- AWESOME.

1901
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,081
- YEAH.

1902
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:34,388
- I WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE.

1903
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,824
- LOOKING LIKE THAT?

1904
01:21:36,826 --> 01:21:39,293
JUST KIDDING.

1905
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,895
NOT REALLY.

1906
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:51,906
¶ ¶

1907
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:58,646
- MY GOD!

1908
01:21:58,648 --> 01:22:01,882
WHAT DID YOU DO?

1909
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,050
- SOMETHING PRETTY STUPID,

1910
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:06,387
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

1911
01:22:06,389 --> 01:22:08,689
WOW, WHAT MADE YOU
DO ALL THIS?

1912
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:10,891
- WELL, IF WE DIDN'T
THROW A PARTY,

1913
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:12,426
HOW WOULD JOEL GET LAID?

1914
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,494
- YEAH.

1915
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:14,929
WHERE IS THAT SHIT-FACE?

1916
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:18,899
- HE'S IN THE BACK ROOM
GETTING A LOT OF STDs.

1917
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:22,336
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

1918
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:24,438
- BABY, YOU'RE
SO FUCKING HOT.

1919
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,439
WELL, NOT REALLY,

1920
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:26,907
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES.

1921
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:29,109
ASSHOLE, HERE I COME.

1922
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,444
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1923
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,012

01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:48,963
- THOSE ARE SO MUCH
BETTER THAN MY MOM'S.

01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:52,466
THAT IS HONESTLY...

1930

- SORRY, BUT THE WORLD
DOES NOT NEED TO KNOW

1965
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:18,846
HOW I FEEL EVERY SECOND
OF EVERY DAY.

1966
01:25:18,848 --> 01:25:20,147
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT I THINK

1967
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:22,649
THAT AS SOON AS WE COMMENT
ON THE PRESENT,

1968
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:24,985
WE KIND OF LOSE IT FOREVER.

1969
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:27,454
AND THE PRESENT
IS WHERE THINGS HAPPEN.

1970
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:30,524
SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT.

1971
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:33,994
SOMETIMES IT'S GLORIOUS.

1972
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:35,863
BUT IT'S ALWAYS
THE PLACE TO BE,

1973
01:25:35,865 --> 01:25:39,166
BECAUSE LIFE HAPPENS
IN THE PRESENT,

1974
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:42,369
ONE SECOND TO THE NEXT.

1975
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:46,673
AND IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH ONE FOOT IN THE PAST,

1976
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:50,043
WELL, YOU'RE MISSING
A FUCKING FOOT.

- DON'T SPIT, GOD.

1980
01:26:06,061 --> 01:26:07,394
- SOMETIMES IT NEEDS
SOME LUBRICATION.

1981
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:08,395
- NO, IT DOES NOT.

1982
01:26:08,397 --> 01:26:09,630
- NATURAL LUBRICATION

1983
01:26:09,632 --> 01:26:11,031
IS ONE OF THE BEST TYPES
OF LUBRICATION,

1984
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:13,467
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE
EATING FUCKING PUSSY.

1985
01:26:13,469 --> 01:26:14,535

- NO, NO.
- I THINK I'M HIGH.

THAT QUICKLY.
