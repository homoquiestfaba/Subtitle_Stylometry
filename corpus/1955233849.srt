1
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,178
<i>To be or not to be?</i>

2
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,060
<i>To be or not to be?</i>

3
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,577
<i>Why ask me? I'm not a prince.</i>

4
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,733
<i>Not anymore.</i>

5
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,369
<i>To be or not to be?</i>

6
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>Not since I accidentally caused
the fall of the Ching dynasty.</i>

7
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,776
<i>I moved to Shanghai,
where everyone reinvents themselves.</i>

8
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,251
<i>I became a fixer for the rich.</i>

9
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,618
<i>A con artist.</i>

10
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,215
<i>To be or not to be?</i>

11
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,933
<i>I have a talent for telling lies.
Is it my fault everyone believes me?</i>

12
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,132
<i>My story starts when Wu-Seven...</i>

13
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,533
<i>...seventh son
of the great General Wu...</i>

14
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,420
<i>...came to me for a favour.</i>

15
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,097
<i>To be or not to be?</i>

16
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,900
<i>I am Ma Zouri.</i>

17
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,492
<i>I believe in Shanghai.
I made it here.</i>

18
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,540
<i>My father made it here.
My cousins made it here.</i>

19
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,693
<i>Anyway, here's how
I shamed Shanghai.</i>

20
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,092
<i>I've fallen for an Italian broad
who I wanted to bang.</i>

21
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,933
I flew her to Shanghai.

22
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,252
She asked for a bowl of noodles
from Chef Huang.

23
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,096
I said, "Done!" I cleared the street,
booked the restaurant.

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,458
I even brought her the noodles myself.

25
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,500
She didn't touch them. She asked me:

26
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,858
"Where's the chef?"
I said, "She's gone."

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,095
Then she asked,
"And the people on the street?"

28
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,570
I said, "I got rid of them all."

29
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,091
She was furious.

30
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,776
She stuck her finger in my face
and said:

31
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,977
"You schmuck!"

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,980
Me? Wu-Seven?

33
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,339
Called a schmuck
by a little Italian tramp?

34
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,933
So the next day I sped to the airport...

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,695
...and stopped her plane on the tarmac.

36
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,217
I stuck my piece
in her bodyguard's face.

37
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,973
"Scram!"

38
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,169
I boarded her plane
and confronted her, "Signorina...

39
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,539
...I'm here with your noodles
and Chef Huang."

40
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,577
She tried the noodles,
"This is not wok-fresh."

41
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,459
I said, "What?"

42
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,974
"Wok-fresh!

43
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,172
This is the essence
of fine Chinese cooking.

44
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,175
Stray but 5 metres from her kitchen...

45
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,730
...that wok-fresh aroma is lost!

46
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,100
Master Wu-Seven...

47
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,411
...you are Chinese,
the son of a warlord.

48
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,175
But you know crap about wok-fresh!

49
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,013
Forget about me.

50
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,491
Forget about Rome.

51
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,732
To me you're nothing.

52
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,094
Nothing but new money."

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,976
With that she flew off to Tokyo...

54
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,496
...to try some Japanese udon.

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,414
I felt like a complete fool.

56
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,893
Even Chef Huang snickered at me.

57
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,337
So I asked all my advisors:

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,890
"How do I restore my dignity...

59
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,700
...impress this babe...

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,820
...and turn my money from new to old?"

61
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,292
Everyone said...

62
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,498
...I should come to see you...

63
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,060
...Ma Zouri.

64
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,656
Why did you take her to noodles...

65
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,096
...without coming to me first?

66
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,015
From now on,
I'll always come to you first.

67
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,973
You have to help me.

68
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,574
How?

69
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,820
No, that I cannot do.

70
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,619
- Huang doesn't deserve to die.
- Tell me.

71
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,093
You.... How much for a "yes"?

72
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,374
You have no respect for me.

73
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,419
You don't treat me as a friend.

74
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,450
You come for help
without even addressing me properly.

75
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,338
You called me Ma, not Mr. Ma.

76
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,698
Mr. Ma, I've been so upset
by this "new money."

77
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,052
I can't even finish spending my cash.

78
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,813
- How much?
- Enough to buy half of Shanghai.

79
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,332
Mr. Ma, help me spend it.

80
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,059
But with one condition:

81
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,018
Make me look like old money.

82
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,817
Do this, then name your own price.

83
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,455
Master Wu-Seven...

84
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,737
...why such disrespect?

85
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,812
I was once an aristocrat.

86
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,858
If I'd only been more careful...

87
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,411
- ...it wouldn't have ended.
- What ended?

88
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,810
Tell him. It's time for the truth.

89
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,613
Don't blame yourself
for the empire's demise.

90
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,578
I am responsible. It was a snowy eve.

91
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,097
The empress dowager summoned me.

92
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,174
"The Allies are invading," she cried.
"And the people are rebelling!

93
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,855
How do I save the empire?" I said:

94
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,091
"No big deal. Starting tomorrow...

95
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,172
...all men should...

96
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,572
...cut off their pigtails."

97
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,380
The empress dowager gasped.

98
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,454
I went on, "Show everyone...

99
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,976
...we nobles can be new."

100
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,498
The empress was delirious.

101
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,380
"You're my guy, Ma!

102
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,136
And now go. Get it done!

103
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,534
Tomorrow I'll issue an imperial edict."

104
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,975
I was so happy.

105
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,454
I ran all the way out of the palace.

106
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,736
The snow hushed the night.

107
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,052
I wanted to raise a toast
to the emperor. Just one drink.

108
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,451
But I ended up with two whole jugs.

109
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,571
By the time I woke up, it was already...

110
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,298
...the Republic!

111
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,260
We still cut our pigtails.

112
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,855
But we were forced to.

113
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,697
Not the same as voluntarily.

114
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,410
Perhaps it's karma.

115
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,575
Because I drank,
the Ching dynasty fell.

116
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,620
Because it fell,
your father became general.

117
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,252
Because your father
became general...

118
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,857
...you date girls
out of your league.

119
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,377
A general's son bows to you...

120
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,736
...in the old Manchurian way.

121
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,972
- I got him by the balls.
- You the man.

122
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,860
- Rise!
- That means "rise."

123
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,170
Rise!

124
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,736
Some day, and that day
may never come...

125
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,210
...I may call on you for a favour.

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,577
But before we get into that...

127
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,177
...let us turn your money from new...

128
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,809
- ...to old.
- Sounds like money laundering.

129
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,654
It is. Didn't I make myself clear?

130
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,890
Yes, you did.

131
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,098
I'm blowing money
from my dad's military budget...

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,172
...in the name of peace.

133
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,740
Noble of you.

134
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,091
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

135
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,979
Bye.

136
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,012
So much money.
How we gonna spend it?

137
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,180
We spend it lavishly.

138
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,259
<i>Shanghai, city of adventure!</i>

139
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,900
<i>The Paris of the Far East!</i>

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,337
<i>And now, host to the modern age's
most unusual election:</i>

141
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,935
<i>presidency of the Global Escort Nation!</i>

142
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,980
<i>That's right, once a Shanghai contest
limited only to Chinese working girls...</i>

143
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,453
<i>...for the first time, this election opened
its doors to candidates around the world.</i>

144
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,692
<i>And in cities and towns everywhere,
voters decided on their favourite:</i>

145
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,374
<i>courtesans from Canada...</i>

146
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,135
<i>...flower girls from France,
geisha from Japan...</i>

147
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,294
<i>...and American streetwalkers.
And tonight, in a grand finale...</i>

148
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,976
<i>...three finalists will compete to become
the world's First Lady of the Evening.</i>

149
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,974
<i>Every district in Shanghai
hoped to host this final election.</i>

150
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,575
<i>The French District won,
thanks to the help of Mr. Xiang...</i>

151
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,857
<i>...who happens to head
the organising committee.</i>

152
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,611
The French Concession is honoured
to host the final escort election.

153
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,252
This honour belongs not just to the
French and Chinese, but to the world!

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,692
<i>Sadly, this German nominee
got her paperwork in late.</i>

155
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,813
<i>She committed suicide out of despair.</i>

156
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,339
<i>But the international and
local communities in Shanghai...</i>

157
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,210
<i>...rallied to her memory, prompting
this statement from Mr. Ma Zouri...</i>

158
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,860
<i>...producer of the event:</i>

159
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,094
<i>Making the election global is
one small step for the Escort Nation...</i>

160
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,695
...but one giant leap for mankind.

161
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,854
Can mankind be united by
a common quest for truth and beauty?

162
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,933
That I can't say.

163
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,013
What I can say is...

164
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,773
...it couldn't hurt.

165
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,138
I believe this is the future of mankind.

166
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,014
<i>So let us honour these hopeful
and inspiring young leaders...</i>

167
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,139
<i>...as they ask not what service
the world can do for them...</i>

168
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,737
<i>...but how they can service the world.</i>

169
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,735
Ladies and gentlemen!

170
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,131
- Today is history.
- Today is history.

171
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,619
Today is history.

172
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,500
- Today, we make history.
- Today, we make history.

173
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,012
Today, we make history.

174
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,379
And today, we are part of history.

175
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,329
- And today, we are part of history.
- And today, we are part of history.

176
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,217
I was told the whole world
is staying up...

177
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,212
- ...for our broadcast.
- That's true.

178
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,734
How supportive!

179
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,369
Let's make it worth their while.

180
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,020
How do we do that?

181
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,773
Keep it moving.

182
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,171
So who are the finalists?

183
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,457
Shangguan, the Green Dragon.

184
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,499
Foster, the White Tiger.

185
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,653
- A dragon and a tiger.
- It's astrological.

186
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,018
A battle of celestial bodies.

187
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,130
But only one super star
can shine as our president.

188
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,620
And the last candidate?

189
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,692
- Our former president.
- Who's that?

190
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,693
- Miss Wanyan Ying!
- Miss Wanyan Ying!

191
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:54,618
And now, a song so new
that Mr. Gershwin won't even write it...

192
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,896
...for another 10 years.

193
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,259
Miss White Tiger Foster,
as she shares with us the beauty...

194
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,340
...and the passion of "Summertime."

195
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,979
<i>That's Wu-Six, Wu-Seven's sister.</i>

196
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,096
<i>Her dream is
to become China's Lumière.</i>

197
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,773
<i>Amazingly, tonight's footage will
wind up as China's first feature film.</i>

198
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,539
<i>The bad news?</i>

199
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,774
<i>It will be titled</i> Executing Ma Zouri.

200
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,016
What a touching performance...

201
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,935
...about motherly love
from the American.

202
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,695
It'll be hard to top!

203
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,818
I admit there is nothing greater
than a mother's love.

204
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,814
Except?

205
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,654
Except maybe the love of a father.

206
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,097
So here she is! Singing Puccini...

207
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,410
...Miss Green Dragon.

208
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,255
- "O Mio Babbino Caro"!
- "O Mio Babbino Caro"!

209
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,211
<i>Wanyan Ying always believed...</i>

210
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,770
<i>...she was the granddaughter
of Emperor Wanyan Aguda.</i>

211
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,616
<i>Me? I'm descended from Genghis Khan.</i>

212
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,059
<i>And just like that, Wanyan fell for me.</i>

213
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,456
<i>But I often doubt it.</i>

214
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,376
<i>We're together...</i>

215
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,294
<i>...but we're not really "together."</i>

216
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,060
<i>Wanyan has been
elected president twice.</i>

217
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,735
<i>Unfortunately, at the time,
Escort Nation...</i>

218
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,938
<i>...was just a brothel in Shanghai.</i>

219
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,013
<i>Now she has to defend her title...</i>

220
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,059
<i>...against an international field:</i>

221
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,451
<i>White Tiger from America...</i>

222
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,055
<i>...and Green Dragon from Europe.</i>

223
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,180
Ladies and gentlemen!

224
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,412
Our global broadcast
has the world buzzing!

225
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,369
We've received over 2300 telegrams.

226
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,611
From England, France, Austria...

227
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,500
- ...Japan, Russia.
- How can we pick one?

228
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,572
Without offending the others.

229
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,857
- We'll pick from a country.
- Smaller units.

230
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,773
- You mean families?
- Smaller.

231
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,296
An individual? Too many of those.

232
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,929
- So pick the most miserable.
- Like this one.

233
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,935
It's from Private Olgakov of Ukraine.

234
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,051
"Cease-fire reached with the enemy.

235
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,291
Awaiting Wanyan's appearance.

236
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,259
If she doesn't show...

237
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,496
...all hell will break loose."

238
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,891
- What does that mean?
- It means...

239
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,938
...if Madam President
doesn't show up...

240
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,935
...Ukraine will burn.

241
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,490
Madam President!

242
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,493
Stop fighting. Can you hear me?

243
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,130
- They can't reply.
- It's a live broadcast!

244
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,815
But not a phone call.

245
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,733
Perhaps they'll cable.

246
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,937
Hurry up, war's about to start again!

247
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,773
Why must men always fight?

248
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,133
You all deserve a good spanking!

249
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,575
Man needs woman's love.
Just like a child needs its mother.

250
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,254
Men, give up your arms...

251
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,930
...and return to the arms
of your women!

252
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,573
Let's be content as women.

253
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,130
Let's not fight like men.

254
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,098
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Green Dragon...

255
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,171
...and White Tiger...

256
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,695
...all have such beautiful moves.

257
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,580
I didn't want to step on their moments.

258
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,140
But now I've done it.

259
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,657
No, no, keep going!

260
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,260
In your opinion, what should we do?

261
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,537
Take less. Give more.

262
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,489
Giving makes one happy.

263
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,017
Giving blesses the world.

264
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,140
- Why not give a little yourself?
- A little? How about I give it all?

265
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,178
All my possessions.

266
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,255
Jewellery, clothing, car, property.

267
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,096
Everything.

268
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,652
- To who?
- To babies...

269
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,815
...who need milk.
To the poor who need homes.

270
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,017
To the old who need care.

271
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,691
I have money, and so do you.
To hell with middlemen!

272
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,180
I'll give directly. All!

273
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,173
Hold it, please!

274
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,737
I've just decided
I'll also donate myself.

275
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,500
My past, my present and my future.

276
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,450
Look at you!

277
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,051
I'm auctioning my virginity.
For 30 nights.

278
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,813
The bidding will start soon.

279
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,815
Please be generous!
All proceeds will be donated.

280
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,334
I won't keep a dime.

281
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,251
What did you say you'll auction off?

282
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,774
My virginity.

283
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,140
Funny, right?

284
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,295
A working girl speaking of virginity?

285
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,016
As the saying goes, the past is dead.

286
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,978
The future is unknown.

287
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,980
Like the sunrise or a newborn...

288
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,532
...like the dew or our new world...

289
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,499
...we greet each morning reborn.

290
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,059
Each night can also be a first.

291
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,578
The secret to love?

292
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,814
Treat each time like the first time!

293
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,539
<i>Wanyan! Wanyan!</i>

294
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,934
According to our charter,
whoever gets the loudest cheers...

295
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,730
...will be the next president.

296
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,459
And now...

297
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,539
...Green Dragon and White Tiger.

298
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,532
- On stage, please!
- On stage, please!

299
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,340
Who votes for Miss White Tiger?

300
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,699
<i>Wanyan! Wanyan!</i>

301
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,580
- What about Green Dragon?
<i>- Wanyan! Wanyan! Wanyan!</i>

302
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,292
<i>Just as we planned,
Wanyan became...</i>

303
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,180
<i>...the president of Escort Nation.</i>

304
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,571
<i>We thought the story would end here.</i>

305
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,017
<i>But stories, like life, get out of control.</i>

306
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,330
Good news!

307
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,340
Telegram from the Ukrainian front!

308
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,819
Permanent cease-fire.

309
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,451
- Cease-fire!
- Cease-fire!

310
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,616
<i>Wanyan! Wanyan! Wanyan!</i>

311
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,336
- Listeners!
- Honoured guests!

312
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,571
Prepare yourselves
for the biggest, the boldest surprise.

313
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:57,691
Who will crown the new president?

314
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,379
A glittering star.

315
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,170
A living legend. She is....

316
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,979
Madam Sai.

317
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,494
- Jin.
- Hua.

318
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,178
History calls her
the Joan of Arc of China.

319
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,492
Alone, she faced the Allied armies...

320
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,418
...and their horny German commander.

321
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,652
She is Madam Sai.

322
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,018
Super siren!

323
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,532
Dearest friends...

324
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,695
...the eyes of the world
are upon you.

325
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,219
So open your chequebooks
and be generous to your new president.

326
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,659
The crowning of Miss Wanyan...

327
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,337
...will conclude our auction.

328
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,572
<i>We succeeded.</i>

329
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,370
<i>Master Wu-Seven's money
became clean.</i>

330
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,294
<i>In fact, we cleaned him out.</i>

331
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,817
<i>We spent it all.</i>

332
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,974
<i>Every last dime.</i>

333
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,817
Miss! Miss!

334
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,892
Miss! One more thing.

335
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,813
- Yes?
- I don't get it.

336
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,815
You didn't eat or drink,
you even brought your own bed.

337
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,293
- Now you even refuse a tip?
- Grandpa...

338
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,214
...I did it for charity.

339
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,456
Miss! Miss!
This is my mother's ring.

340
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,733
I never married,
so I want you to have it.

341
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,933
Please, your bid was payment enough.

342
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,294
At my age, I thought I'd seen it all.

343
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,656
Life had lost its lustre.

344
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,654
But now...

345
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,019
...you just showed me
what I've missed out on.

346
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,099
You have re-lit the fire within me.

347
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,377
That's why I'm here.

348
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,896
To rekindle your fire.

349
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,494
Can I have your number?

350
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,290
Give him my card.

351
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,972
Grandpa, here's my card. Call me.

352
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,212
Grandpa, keep your fire lit.

353
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,889
I'll hold a torch for you.

354
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,212
Forget me not!

355
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,452
- Next stop.
- Joseph's place.

356
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,498
Lafayette, B1389.

357
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,371
I thought our next appointment
was with Mr. Liu.

358
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,259
Mr. Liu won the bid originally...

359
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,332
...but he gifted her to Joseph.

360
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,978
He can't do that! Gift her away!

361
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,496
We can't be picky.

362
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,175
We must reward every bidder.

363
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,569
The world watches.

364
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,020
- Where to, which road?
- Lafayette, B1389.

365
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,536
It's right here.

366
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,579
<i>In</i> Red Chamber, <i>it's written:</i>

367
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,175
<i>"When the fake is taken to be real...</i>

368
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,730
<i>...the real often becomes fake."</i>

369
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,019
<i>Wanyan really believes
she's president now.</i>

370
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,615
<i>Awashed in platonic love...</i>

371
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,898
<i>...she treats me like a lowly driver.</i>

372
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,771
<i>I drive her from "charity" to "charity."</i>

373
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,217
<i>I try to wake her up...</i>

374
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,498
<i>...but she's lost in her dream.</i>

375
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,937
<i>What a mess!</i>

376
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,778
<i>We're heading for trouble.</i>

377
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,571
Shuwan Gou,
I thought we were going to Joseph's.

378
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,857
This is Zhu-Three's place.

379
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,209
Joseph is Zhu-Three!

380
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,970
Really?

381
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,930
I know a Zhu-Three. I hate him.

382
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,889
- Hope it's not the same guy.
- Same guy.

383
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,170
Then it's your fault. If I knew...

384
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,573
...I wouldn't have brought her here.

385
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,490
Wanyan said we shouldn't be picky.

386
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,380
The whole world is watching us.

387
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,971
She's acting presidential.

388
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,338
Joseph or Zhu-Three,
we have to treat them equally.

389
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,971
She's a pro. I respect her.

390
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,499
Ma Zouri! Ma Zouri! Ma Zouri!

391
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,255
No! Oh, no! Ma Zouri!

392
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,379
I thought we were friends!

393
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,932
Peking, Shanghai, Paris.

394
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,458
I've been to all their best restaurants.

395
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,054
On several occasions...

396
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,698
...the restaurant had but one table.

397
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,020
And I was the only guest.

398
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,133
It must be a thing with you men.

399
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,654
Come.

400
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,975
This is the highest building
in Shanghai.

401
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,012
Just opened today.

402
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,970
I took over the restaurant.

403
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,537
Got the best Italian chef.

404
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,576
- Just for you.
- Thanks.

405
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,050
On my 8th birthday, I made a wish.

406
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,852
If one day a man would fight for me,
I'd marry him.

407
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,814
Just 8 years old?

408
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,257
I waited until my 18th birthday.

409
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,537
And then my 28th.

410
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,898
I lost hope.

411
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,053
Will I be waiting at 38?

412
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,060
Finally...

413
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,657
...when I least expected it...

414
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,380
...he appeared.

415
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,493
He's you.

416
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,770
Impossible.

417
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,170
You beat up Joseph for me,
out of jealousy.

418
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,979
Me, jealous of him?

419
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,860
Because you love me.

420
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,899
You and I have been friends
for 30 years.

421
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,050
That long?

422
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,492
- And we've been intimate.
- Exactly.

423
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,734
And you got so jealous,
you beat up Joseph...

424
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,211
...your good friend. That's love.

425
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,690
I beat him up because he's an ass.

426
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,616
He's a copycat.
He copies everything I do.

427
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,819
- If I date a plump girl--
- Excuse me.

428
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,370
Thank you.

429
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,896
Have you ever said, "I love you"?

430
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,858
Baby, I love you.

431
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,930
Speak Chinese.

432
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,934
- Love you. I.
- Who loves?

433
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,417
- Who do you love? Say the whole thing.
- You.

434
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,937
- I lovest thee.
- "Thee"? So formal.

435
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,898
Because I respect you.

436
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,815
I don't want you to respect me,
I want you to love me!

437
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,218
Off-the-shoulder!

438
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,051
- Sweetheart neckline.
- Oh, my!

439
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,137
- Strapless, high waist!
- Look at that!

440
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,538
Mermaid tail.

441
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,415
Look at the leggings!

442
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,810
Looks like pants to me.

443
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,695
How many times do you plan
to be married?

444
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,140
Whenever I see a gown I like...

445
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,853
...I buy it.

446
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,057
I've been collecting for years.

447
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,740
- Pretty, right?
- You're prettier the other way.

448
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,369
- What do you mean? Pig!
- Naked.

449
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,377
Can't get married without a dress.

450
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,055
- Just who will you marry?
- You.

451
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,098
Shuwan Gou! Shuwan Gou!
Shuwan Gou!

452
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,060
- What do you want with her?
- I want her to save me.

453
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,531
Why save you?
My assistant saves only me.

454
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,620
Just ignore him!

455
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,655
You're acting strange today.

456
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,131
Accusing me of being jealous.

457
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,618
Telling me to say "I love you."

458
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,091
Now ordering me to marry you.

459
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,576
That's three giant steps in one day.

460
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,530
- Let's make love.
- We just did.

461
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,060
My mother comes in two days.

462
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,535
We'll marry then. A Western wedding.

463
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,736
Why Western?

464
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,860
I love it when the couple stands there
and says:

465
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,974
- "I do."
- You even know what "I do" means?

466
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,899
I love thee.

467
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,774
Wrong. That's not what it means.

468
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,092
You know how the English say,
"How do you do"?

469
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,776
What does the "do" mean?

470
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,330
It means to force it, to push,
to doo-doo.

471
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,532
When an Englishman wakes up...

472
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,090
...he trots to the bathroom
and takes care of business.

473
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,900
It makes him feel noble.

474
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,736
When a friend asks him,
"How do you do?"...

475
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,940
...what does "do" mean? It means,
"Did you take a noble dump?"

476
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,012
- It's all about poo-poo.
- Yes...

477
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,419
...it's about making doo-doo!

478
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,092
Don't laugh. If you don't do it regularly,
your brain will explode.

479
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,379
It killed Caesar, Nero and George II.

480
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,569
So.... Why would you say "do"
at a wedding?

481
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,459
"We are gathered here to do...."

482
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,579
Everybody'll shit themselves.

483
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,696
I see.

484
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,260
But I still want a Western wedding.

485
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,300
I'm going to say "I do"
and so will you.

486
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,770
- Stop pinching me!
- Say it!

487
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,370
No!

488
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,459
- I can pinch you back. Cry out.
- Say "I do."

489
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,657
- I'm going to hurt you.
- Just say it!

490
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,489
- This doesn't hurt?
- Say "I do."

491
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,020
Why aren't you crying? You're bruised.

492
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,377
You can hurt me all you want...

493
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,419
- ...but you'll marry me.
- But I don't want either.

494
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,458
What do you have against marriage?

495
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,211
It's a serious business.

496
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,293
You don't want to marry
someone like me.

497
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,332
- Why not?
- Well, I'm still a child.

498
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,332
You are too old to be a child,
and too hung.

499
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,220
I'm too hung up to settle down.

500
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,860
Afraid of responsibility?

501
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,171
Fine. I'll take charge.

502
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,169
I proposed, didn't I?

503
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,890
I'll arrange everything.

504
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,655
I'm just begging you to say "I do"!

505
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,576
Since we're old friends,
I'll do you this favour.

506
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,812
We've pulled many scams before.

507
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,573
Is that what this is to you?

508
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,459
- I thought you wanted to fool your mom?
- No!

509
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,532
- So whose mother are we fooling?
- Yours!

510
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,410
You fraud!

511
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,813
Wait, is that a gun?

512
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,778
I was just kidding.
What's with the gun?

513
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,977
Do you even know how to use it?

514
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,060
I'll shoot you and then I'll shoot myself.

515
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,257
Then I'll marry you in hell.

516
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,458
Why are you still
acting like a princess?

517
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,211
- China's now a republic.
- Couldn't care less.

518
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,971
- Have I ever begged?
- No.

519
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,018
- Have I ever grovelled?
- Definitely not.

520
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,571
I was elected president
because I played my part perfectly.

521
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,493
Indeed you did. You were perfect.

522
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,973
Now I just want you to love me
and marry me.

523
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,338
- But you turned me down.
- No, I didn't.

524
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,412
I care for you.

525
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,658
I think you're wonderful.

526
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,937
You don't need to marry me.

527
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,420
I am already yours.

528
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,814
If you don't marry me,
I don't want to live.

529
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,212
Our hearts should be as one.

530
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,692
That's not where the heart is.

531
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,737
It's here.

532
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,090
Pull the trigger!

533
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,460
What if the gun was loaded?

534
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,296
You'd be dead.

535
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,780
Come on!

536
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,252
Don't threaten me again
with a fake gun.

537
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,333
It's loaded.

538
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,900
In my previous life...

539
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,580
...I must have owed you bigtime.

540
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,060
Otherwise, why would I...

541
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:46,933
...put up with you?

542
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,780
In our previous lives,
we must have been...

543
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,220
...two eyeballs on the same face.

544
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,249
We were born as a pair.

545
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,177
But destined never to see each other.

546
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,572
So which one of us was the left eye?

547
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,220
Take your pick.

548
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,259
You can be the left, I'll be the right.

549
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,540
- I was the right.
- Then I was the left.

550
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,413
So close, but never to meet...

551
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,811
...that's sad.

552
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,294
What if we were cross-eyed?

553
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,140
You must have a really flat nose...

554
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,498
...for the right to see the left!

555
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,414
No way.

556
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,096
One could never see the other.

557
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,252
So sad.

558
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,616
I know how they could meet.

559
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,859
Pluck one eyeball out...

560
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,611
...then they can see eye-to-eye.

561
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,213
- No!
- Then what?

562
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,691
- A snail! Eyes on a snail!
- A snail?

563
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,491
- A snail has eyes like this.
- About this high!

564
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,971
It can even see behind itself.

565
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,699
We're eye-crossed lovers!

566
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,217
- Or we could be two waves.
- Waves?

567
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,293
I'll forever be chasing after you.

568
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,897
- Do you want to steer our boat?
- I do.

569
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,100
- Where are we going now?
- Wherever you say.

570
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,331
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- I do.

571
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,378
We don't want to go anywhere!

572
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,657
Why so fast
if we're not going anywhere?

573
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,618
We have to go fast to be nowhere.

574
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,575
- Take me home.
- I do.

575
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,018
We are home!

576
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,740
- Is this home?
- It is.

577
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,894
Home is wherever you are.

578
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,770
- Lights!
- I do. Lights!

579
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,617
Too bright.

580
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,100
I'll turn them off.

581
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,455
Aim! Fire!

582
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,659
Look at that!

583
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,740
Are you singing?

584
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,053
I'll bring down the brightest lantern
for you.

585
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,172
Stop! You'll scare my friends!

586
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,370
The man in the moon?

587
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,097
No, the rabbit!

588
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,253
I can see his ears.

589
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,810
If you see his ears, then he's close by.

590
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,051
Too close.

591
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,337
Look at him! Making a mess.

592
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,095
- He's making medicine.
- He's a dirty rabbit.

593
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,377
- A dust bunny!
- Let's go sweep the dust!

594
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,893
Then the moon will shine bright
in the day.

595
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,818
Let's go!

596
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,579
- So, what's this medicine for?
- Immortality.

597
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,817
Perfect. Let's go.

598
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,937
Let's live forever!

599
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,059
Who else is up there?

600
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,413
- The woman in the moon.
- What about her man?

601
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,140
- He couldn't commit.
- Then kick him out!

602
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,850
It'll just be her, the rabbit, me and you.

603
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,057
- You'll marry me, then?
- I'll marry you all.

604
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,576
- No, just me.
- "I do."

605
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,860
<i>Never smoke opium.</i>

606
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,774
<i>Never!</i>

607
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:26,731
<i>It's what killed Wanyan.</i>

608
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,496
<i>If I knew...</i>

609
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,050
<i>...that love would have kept you alive!</i>

610
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,294
<i>Why didn't I confess sooner?</i>

611
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,180
<i>What should I do now?</i>

612
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,731
<i>I run.</i>

613
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,779
<i>No one will believe
what happened here.</i>

614
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,897
<i>I don't remember myself.</i>

615
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,619
<i>Who can I turn to?</i>

616
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,612
<i>Wu-Six.</i>

617
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,011
<i>Her dad is a warlord.</i>

618
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,969
<i>And her mom
was my beloved grade-school teacher.</i>

619
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,815
- Name?
- Ma Zouri.

620
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,539
Business?

621
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,455
- Looking for Wu-Six. Seven.
- Who?

622
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,692
- Six or Seven?
- Six, I guess.

623
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,089
This way!

624
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,375
Sit!

625
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,420
Read!

626
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,379
Escort Nation President found

627
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,138
Miss Wu-Six will see you now!

628
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,939
<i>We're taking the train
to film the sunset.</i>

629
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,137
Perfect, I can help.

630
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,860
I made films in France.

631
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,979
"A train arrives."
"Another train arrives."

632
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,735
- Say something in French.
- Yes, very good.

633
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,414
Cheese.

634
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,735
At Siruiying Elementary,
I mastered six languages.

635
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,778
My mother taught there.

636
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,930
- What's her name?
- Qi.

637
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,492
My 3rd grade teacher!

638
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,452
Your mother was quite a looker.

639
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,220
Every boy's fantasy.

640
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,135
She enlightened us in many ways.

641
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,973
What'd you do in France?

642
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,010
I was in love...

643
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,973
...and followed this girl home...

644
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,574
...to Loch Lomond.

645
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,529
We sat on its bonny banks...

646
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,572
- ...watching the sun rise and set.
- What happened?

647
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,811
The war started.

648
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,735
I told her, "Wait at the lake.

649
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,650
If I die,
my soul will take the high road...

650
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,852
...and you'll take the low road.
And I'll be home before ye."

651
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,251
Isn't that a Scottish song?

652
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,934
- They sing of me there too?
- You know...

653
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,569
...that you die in that song?

654
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,653
Well, I almost died.

655
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,858
A cannonball exploded near me.

656
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,931
I survived, but I lost my leg.

657
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,454
Lost your leg?

658
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,055
They gave me a wooden one.

659
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,815
Can't tell which one it is, right?

660
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,970
Of course I can!

661
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,690
You kicked me in the good leg!

662
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,658
That one hurts even more.

663
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,979
<i>Wu-Six broke my leg.</i>

664
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,338
<i>She actually broke them both.</i>

665
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,370
<i>She doesn't like show-offs.</i>

666
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,252
<i>They went on to film the sunset
without me.</i>

667
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,530
<i>If only I'd gone with her....</i>

668
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,375
You startled me.

669
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,817
It's been a while. You've aged.

670
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,892
- Really?
- Yes.

671
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,250
You look like a teacher
in those glasses.

672
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,537
I borrowed these, for a disguise.

673
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,459
What have you done?

674
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,055
Is that why you came to see me?

675
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,055
Actually, I hate to trouble you, but....

676
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,611
Trouble me or your Teacher Qi?

677
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,693
- Is she here?
- Xiao Qiang!

678
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,377
Take Mr. Ma to see his Teacher Qi.

679
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,899
Is that a robot?

680
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,534
- Did you build it?
- I'm still monkeying with it.

681
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,774
<i>Oh, destiny, changeable like the moon.</i>

682
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,250
Is that really you,
my beloved Teacher Qi?

683
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,695
Siruiying Elementary, right?

684
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,499
- You recognise me?
- At Siruiying Elementary...

685
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,856
...I was Teacher Qi.

686
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,855
At Yijing High, I was Madam Qi.

687
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,013
At Peking College, I was Principal Qi.

688
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,173
That's how I know your school.

689
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,937
But I can't place you.

690
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,490
- It's Ma Zouri.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

691
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,730
I went by my Manchurian name.

692
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,540
- I sat in the last row.
- Never mind.

693
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,331
- What can I do for you?
- Dear Teacher Qi, I humbly bid you--

694
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,731
What's with "dear teacher"?

695
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,335
- Tell her.
- I was about to.

696
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,050
Mother, he said you were his lover...

697
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,220
...in his dreams.
He said you awoke him.

698
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,414
- Carnally.
- I don't recall saying that.

699
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,376
- Years ago in the train.
- You desired me?

700
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,251
- Sorry.
- Don't be shy.

701
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,380
Few students admit it.

702
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,534
You're the first. You're blushing.

703
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,096
- Disaster!
- Cut the drama!

704
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,411
The old dog is mad.

705
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,175
- He bites the puppy.
- What's going on?

706
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,573
She calls our husband the old dog
and her son a puppy.

707
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,777
- Your son-in-law?
- No, no!

708
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,291
- Why are you holding hands?
- He was my student.

709
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,099
- Prepare dinner.
- Yes, ma'am!

710
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,820
Tell the kitchen, one guest.

711
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,940
- Military songs tonight?
- Always!

712
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,253
Washroom?

713
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,494
Here, here, here again and behind.

714
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,540
All ways lead to a toilet.

715
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,777
- How about I show you?
- You come with me.

716
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,739
- I'll find it. Yes.
- You sure?

717
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,459
Will you ever grow up?

718
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,380
Ma Zouri, time to grovel.

719
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,577
Cat got your tongue?

720
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,574
Am I ashamed to ask for help?

721
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,538
No shame! No shame!

722
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,137
- Who's there?
- It's me, Feitian.

723
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,216
- Help me, Zouri.
- Is that really you?

724
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,611
- What's going on?
- Don't pull, that's a horse bit.

725
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,056
- Horse bit?
- There's a saddle on my back.

726
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,449
Who did this to you?

727
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,055
- General Wu. He said...
- Why?

728
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,610
...I'm not fit to be human.

729
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,659
- He's devolving me into a monkey.
- A monkey?

730
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,254
But you're in the stable.

731
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,298
I'm starting as a horse.

732
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,217
You really offended him.

733
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,416
What'd you do?

734
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,375
Wu-Seven took me out.
His father caught us.

735
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,853
- Whoring?
- What else?

736
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,500
All this for...?

737
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,050
- We screwed Daddy's whores.
- No!

738
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,370
You see that clock?

739
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,732
At midnight...

740
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,849
...he sics those stallions on me.

741
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,339
What? No way!

742
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,378
I don't envy you.

743
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,180
I don't think I can take it.

744
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,298
- I'll unhook you.
- Don't! If I run...

745
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,940
...he'll kill me.

746
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,299
Ask Wu-Six to call off her dad.
Save me, brother.

747
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,975
Charm her.

748
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,894
What time is it?

749
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,092
- 11:37.
- Twenty-three minutes left for salvation.

750
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,860
- If I can't?
- I'll be double horse-fucked!

751
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,613
All rise! Sing!

752
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,740
<i>We know what we know</i>

753
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,813
<i>No pretending, none at all</i>

754
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,735
<i>If we don't know, we say so</i>

755
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,699
<i>No pretending, none at all</i>

756
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,297
<i>Always honest, that's our thing</i>

757
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,579
<i>No pretending, none at all</i>

758
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,336
<i>Confucius gave us these words to sing</i>

759
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,857
<i>No pretending at all, none at all</i>

760
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,852
No pretending at all!

761
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,219
No pretending. Period!

762
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,856
- Sit!
- Sit!

763
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,536
- Who the hell is he?
- I'm me.

764
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,498
Are you my son?
Which one is your mother?

765
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,976
- My Teacher Qi.
- Not a son-in-law?

766
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,654
He was my student.
He sees me as a parent.

767
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,251
Get those two bastards in here!

768
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,650
You know what Seven's problem is?

769
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,979
He spends everything
and screws everyone!

770
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,936
- My military budget?
- Spent it on whores.

771
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,373
- My poor puppy!
- Mom...

772
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,940
...stop crying! I'm not dead!

773
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,615
The money was for my cadet school!

774
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,933
The U.S. has West Point.

775
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,296
China needs East Point!

776
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,578
You just want exotic concubines.

777
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,220
I'm fitter than you think!

778
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:03,218
I want my soldiers to be fit too.

779
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,099
But these two assholes--

780
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,971
Spent money meant for men...

781
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,052
- ...on women.
- That's right.

782
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,089
- He's got it.
- General...

783
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,217
...you are a man of vision.

784
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,380
If I were younger...

785
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:25,329
...I'd follow you into battle.

786
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,856
Other generals spend money
on weapons.

787
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,819
You spend it on people.

788
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,859
You should be angry.

789
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,251
Those assholes deserve to be shot.

790
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,016
Bring me the horse!

791
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,340
Horse-screw them! Then shoot them.

792
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,854
Hold it, sir!

793
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:49,652
Money isn't the only way
to make our soldiers strong.

794
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,415
- What can we do without money?
- Science!

795
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:56,210
Science is for improving weapons,
not human beings.

796
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,612
It can also improve the human body.

797
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,011
Don't believe me? I'll prove it.

798
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:05,374
Can you touch the floor?

799
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,850
- I know I can't.
- Do as I say...

800
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,660
...and you'll be able to immediately.

801
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:14,097
Don't bullshit me.
Or you'll be horse-hammered...

802
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,095
- ...and shot.
- Let's try something else.

803
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,411
- No need. Go for it!
- Let's do this.

804
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,650
Get up!

805
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,376
- Show me!
- Everybody ready?

806
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,815
- Are you all game?
- Of course.

807
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,337
Raise your hands.

808
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,335
Straighten your legs.

809
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,298
Lower your hands slowly.

810
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,770
- Can you touch the floor?
- No.

811
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,500
That's right. Now follow me.

812
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,131
- Just do this 20 times.
- Begin!

813
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,498
One, two, three, four....

814
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,980
The moment of truth.

815
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,215
Raise your hands.
Reach for the sun. And the moon.

816
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,579
For the stars. For the ocean.

817
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,573
Deep into the ocean.

818
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,133
- I did it!
- Stretching adds years...

819
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,817
- ...to life.
- From now on, we sing before dinner...

820
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,619
...and touch toes afterwards.

821
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,938
But you can touch something else.
Your face.

822
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,451
- What do you feel?
- My beard.

823
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,614
No, your smile.
The smile of a child.

824
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,615
I bet you haven't smiled like this
in 40 years.

825
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,420
You son of a bitch,
you haven't smiled at me for ages.

826
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,939
I am smiling.

827
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,494
Let me reward you!

828
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,414
- No need.
- I insist. I owe nobody.

829
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,254
- Must I? Let these two go.
- You must.

830
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,694
Shut up!

831
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,294
My general...

832
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,940
...please let them go.

833
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:59,300
I've never been so humiliated.

834
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,450
That'll teach you...

835
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,976
- ...for being my brother's buddy.
- Yes...

836
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,297
...he is wicked.

837
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,851
Most murder victims
are killed by buddies.

838
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,055
Ma Zouri is your buddy.
But he just saved your ass.

839
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,530
Me?

840
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,331
Your father wasn't really
going to hurt them.

841
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,457
He just needed an excuse to let you go.

842
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,691
But you kept the horse out of my bed.

843
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,054
In spite of his bullshit, Ma's true blue.

844
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,056
Miss Wu-Six, be my witness.
Should Ma come to me one day...

845
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,617
- ...I'll die a thousand times to help him.
- Thanks.

846
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,020
Thanks for the ride. And my life.

847
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:46,059
- Your hat!
- Hey, your hat!

848
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,291
About that stallion...

849
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,420
...please tell no one.
Least of all my French bosses.

850
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,857
Relax. See you.

851
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,771
Ma Zouri! Ma Zouri!

852
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,330
You're wanted for murder!

853
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,376
You're acting kind of weird.

854
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:21,051
- Weird?
- Something's bothering you.

855
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,654
No. I'm fine.

856
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,494
- You sure?
- Of course.

857
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,016
If you have a problem, come tell me.

858
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,412
I can't. Your father would shoot me.

859
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,372
<i>Miss Wu treated me nicely that day.</i>

860
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:42,329
<i>She kept asking if she could help me.</i>

861
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,892
<i>I kept insisting I was fine.</i>

862
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,575
<i>How could I be fine?</i>

863
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,370
<i>They think I'm a murderer now.</i>

864
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,410
<i>I don't understand.</i>

865
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,853
<i>Why was I so free with Wanyan...</i>

866
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,457
<i>...but so nervous...</i>

867
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,660
<i>...and tongue-tied around Wu-Six?</i>

868
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,372
The old Peking crowd is upstairs.

869
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,816
- Wanna join us?
- I'll park the car.

870
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,176
- See you upstairs.
- Okay.

871
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,973
- Sir. Yes, sir.
- Give the key to that lady.

872
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,052
- And money for you. Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

873
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,654
Thank you.

874
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,051
Want a ride?

875
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,934
Where to?

876
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,614
That's too much.

877
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,137
- You hop on.
- But this is not proper.

878
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,490
<i>Does this count as being unselfish?</i>

879
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,098
<i>I went to the general to save my life.</i>

880
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,096
<i>Instead, I saved Xiang's life
by accident.</i>

881
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,219
<i>Xiang's evolved back into a human.</i>

882
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:17,700
<i>But he's coming after me now.</i>

883
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:23,330
<i>Is he being ungrateful?</i>

884
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,774
<i>I can't blame him really.</i>

885
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,854
<i>Everyone needs help at some point.</i>

886
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:37,854
<i>But no one wants to be
reminded of it afterwards.</i>

887
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,857
<i>For years, I eluded his grasp.</i>

888
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:48,335
<i>He started arresting innocent men
for crimes of passion...</i>

889
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:53,017
<i>...they didn't commit.</i>

890
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:58,209
<i>That's how he made
a name for himself...</i>

891
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,738
<i>...and became Shanghai's...</i>

892
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,132
<i>...top Chinese detective.</i>

893
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,856
<i>As for me, I have to keep running.</i>

894
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,693
<i>As time passes...</i>

895
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:18,219
<i>...I don't even know who I am anymore.</i>

896
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:51,653
<i>Hey, friend.
Where can I find some Peking opera?</i>

897
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,573
<i>No Peking opera, Shanghai opera.</i>

898
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,972
Shanghai? No, no. Peking opera.
Ma Zouri.

899
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,530
- The play about him, you mean?
- Ma Zouri.

900
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,612
- Only Shanghai opera.
<i>- Executing Ma Zouri.</i>

901
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,659
Wanyan, Wanyan...

902
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,733
...you ungrateful slut!

903
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,653
You had it coming.

904
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,891
She's Wanyan, the whore.

905
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,211
I'm Ma Zouri, the son of a bitch.

906
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,100
We're a pair of deviants.

907
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,491
When she became president,
she stopped giving me cash.

908
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,094
And stopped giving me ass.

909
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,015
I've no more use for her.

910
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,738
So don't blame me for going psycho.

911
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,060
I'm just doing God's work!

912
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,692
Oh, no, the ditch is too small.

913
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,458
Can't find a shovel.

914
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,816
Can't modify the ditch.

915
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,379
So I'll have to modify the bitch.

916
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,578
- Which one should I use?
- The big one!

917
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,969
The big one!

918
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:09,413
<i>Madam President</i>

919
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:17,053
<i>You had a change of heart</i>

920
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,891
<i>So I ripped you apart</i>

921
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:30,740
<i>Now you are à la carte</i>

922
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,613
Hey, who are you?

923
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,454
They said you waited for me all night.

924
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,614
I would've waited a year
to get an audience with you.

925
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,018
- Autograph?
- No.

926
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,649
I've been asked to deliver something
to you.

927
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,379
- From who?
- Ma Zouri.

928
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,260
His cousin.

929
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,178
Is that so?

930
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,332
Oh, my, this is too much.

931
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,414
Drinks, please.

932
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,859
Besides the gold coins,
did his cousin...?

933
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,013
- Tea, sir.
- Thanks.

934
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,179
- What else did he want?
- He asked me...

935
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,014
...to relay three messages.

936
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:25,810
- Go ahead.
- The first one is, he hopes...

937
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,334
...you stay honest...

938
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,297
- ...and be a serious actor.
- That goes without saying. Number 2?

939
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,577
The second message is...

940
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,936
...he hopes that you...

941
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,093
...stop performing <i>Executing Ma Zouri.</i>

942
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,298
- Why?
- Because...

943
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,373
...it's not good for Ma Zouri.

944
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,896
And it's certainly not good for you.

945
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,491
- And the third?
- The third message is.... Got it?

946
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,050
I meant the cousin's third message.

947
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,770
That is the third message: Got it?

948
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,933
Ma's cousin....

949
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,700
What's he do for a living?

950
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,659
This cousin?

951
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,700
His cousin.... Everything.

952
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,616
And nothing. He's a fixer.
An enforcer.

953
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,416
He doesn't ask twice.

954
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,698
Yesterday, I was threatened
by someone.

955
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,140
I was offered a bribe
to stop acting in this show.

956
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,257
I want to hear from you.
Should I keep acting?

957
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:36,379
- Yes!
- And should I slice and dice?

958
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,130
- Slice! Dice!
- Which knife should I use?

959
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,575
The big one!

960
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,493
No need for these!

961
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,092
And after I cut her up?

962
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,899
Rape and kill!

963
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:57,253
Today, I will kill, but not rape.

964
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,019
Tomorrow, I will rape, but not kill.

965
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:05,093
And the day after tomorrow,
I'll rape and kill.

966
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,496
So to see it all...

967
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,492
...you have to come
three days in a row.

968
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:19,933
<i>Madam President</i>

969
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:27,012
<i>You had a change of heart</i>

970
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,458
XIANG FEITIAN EXECUTES MA ZOURI!

971
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,293
Starring: Xiang Feitian,
Wanyan Ying, Ma Zouri

972
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,537
Directed by: Wu-Six

973
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,929
Shanghai Louis Studio

974
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,933
His name is Ma Zouri.

975
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,933
A scheming, conniving man.

976
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,130
She loved him. He made her.

977
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,176
"Today we make history."

978
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,136
"I will auction myself for the poor."

979
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,893
"Give it away? What's in it for me?"

980
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,858
He decides to murder her.

981
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,172
"Wanyan! President!"

982
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,619
His mind is made up.

983
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,977
"You ungrateful bitch!
I'm going to kill you!"

984
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,818
"Ma, let go of me!"
"You want to leave me penniless?"

985
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,170
"Help! Help!"

986
01:06:58,700 --> 01:06:59,690
He killed her and took off.

987
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,690
Xiang Feitian was torn.

988
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,214
But he decided
he had to arrest Ma Zouri.

989
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,618
"I've known him since childhood.
But I have to uphold the law."

990
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,538
Xiang kills all prisoners
who commit crimes of passion.

991
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,612
Wang Tianwang
lured Ma Zouri out of hiding.

992
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,973
English and French detectives
jointly arrest Ma Zouri.

993
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,374
Ma Zouri is incarcerated.
Xiang is a genius.

994
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,137
A great hero, Xiang Feitian,
a promise fulfilled, and justice served.

995
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,850
"Xiang, please save me!"

996
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,978
"I am good, you are evil."

997
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,177
"I'm justice, you are damned."

998
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,979
"I will execute you personally."

999
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,531
Escort Nation's president
was found dead.

1000
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,453
Murdered by her lover.

1001
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,049
He was on the run.

1002
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,689
But I got him after two years!

1003
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,897
And the whole thing, incredibly...

1004
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:14,658
...was filmed by Miss Wu.

1005
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,773
All of it.
Locations! Characters! Pathos!

1006
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:24,059
It's unprecedented, even in Paris!

1007
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:27,857
- Unprecedented!
- It's an unprecedented feat...

1008
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,979
...brought about solely by my efforts.

1009
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,655
Lucky bastard,
stumbling on such good fortune.

1010
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,334
Fortune favours the prepared.

1011
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,492
But let me ask you, what's our plot?

1012
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,252
- Inspector Xiang kills Ma Zouri.
- Why?

1013
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,935
- Because he killed Wanyan Ying.
- When?

1014
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,490
Why? How? Any witness?

1015
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:52,694
If you don't show all this,
the movie is incomplete.

1016
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,820
But it's water under the bridge.

1017
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,697
- What to do?
- Hire a few actors.

1018
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,892
Your mother loves cross-dressing.

1019
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,177
- She can play Ma Zouri.
- Your mother can!

1020
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,817
She can only play Wanyan.
She can't play a man.

1021
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,176
- Only your mother can.
- Your mother can!

1022
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,775
Let's talk movies.
All mothers are women.

1023
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,094
Obviously. Obviously.

1024
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,491
What I really appreciate
is your way of life.

1025
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:22,971
A man can marry many wives,
have many kids....

1026
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,134
Lovely! Make me Chinese!

1027
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:31,532
By the way,
isn't your father marrying again?

1028
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,578
- Ask your father.
- I'd rather not.

1029
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,058
We must find a good actor. A star.

1030
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,177
Wang Tianwang.

1031
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,975
His most popular play
<i>Executing Ma Zouri...</i>

1032
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,859
...sold out 1000 performances.

1033
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,296
- And made it to the headlines.
- Ma Zouri.

1034
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,860
Ma can play Ma Zouri.

1035
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,569
Genius! Genius!

1036
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,218
Leading man as murderer.

1037
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,734
- Genius!
- Genius!

1038
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,096
Realism is the key to a good movie.

1039
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,377
We'll show a real man
who killed his friend...

1040
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:08,009
...and the climax:
His friend shoots him for real.

1041
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,377
Wait, what's the climax?

1042
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,055
- Executing Ma Zouri.
- On film or for real?

1043
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,610
- Both.
- But he is your friend.

1044
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,373
No more than the inspector.

1045
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,940
The law outweighs friendship.

1046
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,138
He murdered a defenceless woman.

1047
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,659
We must kill him!

1048
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,255
I can't wait to see this movie.

1049
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,492
- We'll shoot as soon as Ma Zouri arrives.
- If he is unwilling?

1050
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,459
Leave it to Inspector Xiang.

1051
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,214
I'm not so sure.

1052
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,772
I'll give you an old story
that'll hook him right in.

1053
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,056
I'm not good at telling tales.

1054
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,820
- Memorise it!
<i>- Attention!</i>

1055
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,812
- Salute!
- At ease.

1056
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,970
Attention!

1057
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,859
- Salute!
- At ease.

1058
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,489
- Attention!
- Salute!

1059
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,889
At ease.

1060
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,618
You killed Wanyan, hid for two years.

1061
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,056
You were free and clear.

1062
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:05,292
But an actor insulted you.

1063
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,450
So you beat him up, got arrested...

1064
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,259
...and landed on death row.

1065
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,249
That sounds about right.

1066
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,578
Totally irrational.

1067
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:25,340
If you saw this actor again,
would you still beat him up?

1068
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,850
Of course!

1069
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,859
You prefer death to insult?

1070
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,780
You've got to come to your senses!

1071
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:38,651
What's the point? I'm about to die.

1072
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,091
Let me tell you a story...

1073
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,857
...about facing death sensibly.

1074
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,696
There was once a samurai in Japan...

1075
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,977
...named Sukyohama Jr.

1076
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,771
When he was 7,
his father got into big trouble...

1077
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,818
...and was hunted down nationwide.

1078
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:03,652
One moonless night, they showed him
a severed head and asked him:

1079
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,939
"Is this your father?"
He shook his head, "No."

1080
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,855
Another moonless night...

1081
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,497
...they brought him another head.

1082
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:18,813
"Is this your father?" Again the boy
said, "No, it's not my father."

1083
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,610
One more moonless night.
One more head.

1084
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:25,137
One more moonless night.
One more head.

1085
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,611
They screamed at Sukyohama Jr.,
"Is this your father?"

1086
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:33,893
He stared at it for a long time.

1087
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,575
His face went pale
and he fell to his knees...

1088
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,575
...stabbed himself with his own sword,
shouting, "Father...

1089
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,495
...I'm coming with you!"

1090
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,139
So...

1091
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,292
...you gonna kill yourself for me?

1092
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:59,450
- Ma Zouri!
- I don't need your help!

1093
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,180
That was a classic samurai story.

1094
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,619
About what?
About a simple-minded son?

1095
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:16,491
No. A clever son...

1096
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,697
...who saved his father.

1097
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,099
Which of the heads was his father's?

1098
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,054
None.

1099
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,333
By committing suicide...

1100
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,174
...he convinced the guards
of his father's death...

1101
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:42,259
...and stopped the manhunt.

1102
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,140
For the last two years...

1103
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:50,217
...I have been executed
over and over in many plays.

1104
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,532
- Why haven't I been saved?
- You know why?

1105
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:56,613
- I don't have a son like that.
- You do.

1106
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,173
You are Sukyohama Jr...

1107
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,300
...and Sukyohama Sr.

1108
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:07,249
Whether you can escape depends on
whether you can commit suicide.

1109
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,971
You want me to live or die?

1110
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,530
Be patient. People demand justice.

1111
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,057
Act in our movie <i>Executing Ma Zouri.</i>

1112
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:22,011
We'll show you committing the murder.

1113
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,896
I'll pretend to shoot you on film,
but the real you...

1114
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,256
...will live on as a Vietnamese.

1115
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:33,935
Here's your new identity.
As your brother in arms...

1116
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,899
...I am ever ready to risk my life
for you.

1117
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:44,294
If you're willing, open up this envelope.

1118
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,214
Tell Wu-Six to come and see me.

1119
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:56,380
We got you a great acting coach.

1120
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,531
Ma Zouri! Ma Zouri!

1121
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,211
You stay true and honest,
and be a serious actor.

1122
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,531
- Say it.
- Why?

1123
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,770
You taught me, remember? Say it.

1124
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,177
You stay true and honest,
and be a serious actor.

1125
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:24,536
- Say it in Shanghainese.
- I don't speak it.

1126
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,653
Stay true and honest.

1127
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,579
Stay true and honest.

1128
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,894
And be a serious actor.

1129
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:34,018
- Actor.
- Now say it together.

1130
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,332
Stay true and honest,
and be a serious actor.

1131
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,250
How do you like my take
on the crime scene?

1132
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,334
Romantic, grandiose, sentimental.

1133
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:47,137
- Get changed.
- Ma Zouri! Ma Zouri!

1134
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,290
Shut up, degenerates!

1135
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,816
Keep cheering for a killer,
and I'll kick you out!

1136
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,619
Hey, hey, hey!

1137
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,260
Be nice.

1138
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,178
- These are my friends.
- Now I get it.

1139
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,857
- The kind of dear friends...
- I got it.

1140
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,334
...who will pay to watch me direct.

1141
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,893
Do you know why
you're dressed like this?

1142
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,733
It sells tickets.

1143
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:27,459
I envy you, little asshole,
starring in a movie.

1144
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,134
My friends, what is a movie?

1145
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:33,533
Film is an art form
that can be appreciated by all.

1146
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,135
There is a saying:

1147
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,371
"Love is a universal language."

1148
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,860
I disagree.

1149
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,172
Does love sell tickets?

1150
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,490
Love is nice,
but violence makes money!

1151
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:50,179
So the universal language is violence.

1152
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,378
With that outfit,
the audience immediately gets it.

1153
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:57,375
You're a violent son of a bitch.

1154
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,492
Let's start shooting.

1155
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,012
Get in the car, we start shooting.

1156
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:06,536
Close your eyes. You're dead.

1157
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,010
- I'm scared.
- Why?

1158
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,974
Of him?

1159
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:16,093
See all the French cops with
their guns? If he tries anything...

1160
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:20,619
...he'll be shot dead in an instant! We'll
film the execution scene a day early!

1161
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,732
- Slate!
<i>- Executing Ma Zouri...</i>

1162
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,495
...Act 1, Scene 1, Take 1! Camera A!

1163
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:26,650
Camera B!

1164
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,698
- Camera C and D!
- Camera!

1165
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,250
Start acting!

1166
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,894
Your pacing is totally off.

1167
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,417
Don't you remember what you've done?

1168
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,334
Let me show you.

1169
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,210
Just follow my instructions.
Here, open the car door!

1170
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,219
Now pick her up.

1171
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:55,776
Drag her behind the car.

1172
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,580
Good. Good. Hurry!

1173
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,732
Pull backward.

1174
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,698
Lay her down.

1175
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,777
Okay. Ma Zouri, catch!

1176
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,534
Now chop!

1177
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,376
Full swing. One, two...

1178
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,930
...three. Go!

1179
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,815
Do it!

1180
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:25,696
<i>Madam President</i>

1181
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,655
<i>You had a change of heart</i>

1182
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,939
Okay. Excellent!

1183
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,295
Now rape the body.

1184
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,773
Now rape the body.

1185
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,892
Put the chopper down first.

1186
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,336
Move!

1187
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,696
What's this?

1188
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,739
Ma Zouri!

1189
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,615
Police! French police!

1190
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,219
Can I have a word with him, sir?

1191
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,856
All right, you have two minutes.

1192
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,659
Ma Zouri...

1193
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,420
...do you have a death wish?

1194
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:16,619
- Just kill me.
- Stop this macho bullshit.

1195
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:19,898
Didn't Inspector Xiang explain to you?

1196
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,298
You'll be released after the movie.

1197
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,737
Yes, he did.

1198
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,532
But I can't do this!

1199
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,135
Are you afraid people will see
how evil you are?

1200
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,814
I am not evil!

1201
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,057
I am innocent.

1202
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,497
Wanyan died because of me.

1203
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,731
Have me shot, I deserve it.

1204
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,179
But she shouldn't be humiliated.

1205
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,252
She was a noble person.

1206
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,731
- She had honour.
- So, what did you do...

1207
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,777
- ...to cause her death that day?
- I can't tell you.

1208
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,932
- Why?
- Because I don't remember!

1209
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:07,011
She was very happy that day.

1210
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,052
She asked me to say "I love you."

1211
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:12,100
I didn't. She wanted me to marry her.

1212
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,497
I wouldn't.

1213
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,977
I gave her some opium.

1214
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:21,573
I took her out for a drive.

1215
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:23,060
That night the moon was...

1216
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:28,374
...so big. So big.

1217
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,377
She said:

1218
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,376
"Let's race to the moon!"

1219
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,850
And so we raced to the moon.

1220
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,057
When I woke up,
the car was overturned.

1221
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,291
She lay there.

1222
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,491
Like she was asleep.

1223
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,176
Take off the mask.

1224
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,932
- No. No.
- Take it off.

1225
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,375
- Take it off!
- No!

1226
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,056
Ma Zouri...

1227
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,020
...can I believe you?

1228
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,380
Lights!

1229
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:27,533
So much for our docu-drama.

1230
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,579
Ma Zouri refuses to act.

1231
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,050
We can still kill him on camera?

1232
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,177
Half a masterpiece.

1233
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,897
A half-assed masterpiece?
We're ruined.

1234
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,972
Indeed.

1235
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:43,577
- May I share a thought?
- Out with it!

1236
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,137
Show a man's face...

1237
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,940
...followed by a baby,
you see tenderness.

1238
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,454
Show a man's face...

1239
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,818
...followed by a naked woman,
it's perverse.

1240
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,251
Show Ma Zouri's ugly mug...

1241
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,139
...then a woman's corpse...

1242
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,860
...the audience thinks
they saw the killing.

1243
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,535
I love artists!

1244
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,818
So from the audience's point of view...

1245
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,291
- ...they've seen it all.
- Who kills Ma Zouri?

1246
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,577
- You or me?
- A toast to Miss Wu!

1247
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,060
- Cheers!
- Get lost.

1248
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,620
- Who?
- All of you.

1249
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,815
Go screw yourselves.

1250
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:22,739
Why are you pissed at us?

1251
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,698
Ma Zouri said he didn't kill anyone.

1252
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,615
Yet here you are,
plotting his execution.

1253
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:32,900
If I remember correctly,
you demanded we shoot him.

1254
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,529
But only because
I thought he was guilty.

1255
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,169
- Killing him is a popular demand.
- What?

1256
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,138
The audience is never wrong, girl.

1257
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,933
- Who are you talking to?
- I was--

1258
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,614
Who do you think you are? Get up!

1259
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,660
Get up!

1260
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,094
Attention!

1261
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,857
Sis, please. Ma Zouri isn't worth this.

1262
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,091
If it wasn't for him...

1263
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:04,539
...our father would've
made Xiang a monkey.

1264
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:12,136
Out! Out! Out!

1265
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,779
See, he acts like a monkey.

1266
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:19,933
I didn't want them to eavesdrop.

1267
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,140
You should attend the opera.
You should be hanging out with stars...

1268
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,453
...not slumming at a police station.

1269
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:30,374
Or cosying up to a male jailbird.

1270
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,419
Has your promotion gone to your head?

1271
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:36,095
- How dare you.
- Please.

1272
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,058
We all benefited from the empire's fall.

1273
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,735
- New power, new money.
- You're a Manchu.

1274
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,812
Your people fell with the empire.

1275
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:45,700
Hey, I'm French now. Bruno Xiang!

1276
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:50,491
When Jean-Pierre is not around,
I run the French Concession.

1277
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,060
I can kill Ma whenever I want.

1278
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,660
You only do
what your French master says.

1279
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:58,740
You said I was new power.

1280
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,099
I'll show you new power.

1281
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,890
I'm taking the film with me.
Nobody kills Ma.

1282
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,416
I'll have him extradited
to the Shanghai Garrison.

1283
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,094
So you command your father now?

1284
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,449
Watch me.

1285
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,650
It's a legal matter.

1286
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,540
- Leave it to the courts.
- So our movie's dead?

1287
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,931
And we don't get to kill Ma Zouri?

1288
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,217
Killing Ma Zouri is up to you.

1289
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:30,335
- I can't do that myself.
- Yes, you can.

1290
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,459
Your sister may be a softie, but--

1291
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:36,977
Get out! Justice is my job.

1292
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,215
Killing Ma Zouri isn't personal.

1293
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,337
For two years, the public has cried out.

1294
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:46,011
Be a hero. Kill him for the people.

1295
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:49,218
You're not killing Ma Zouri,
the people are.

1296
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,655
I totally got it.

1297
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,654
That's a good baby general.

1298
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,333
Ma Zouri!

1299
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:02,058
The one the public has wanted dead
for years?

1300
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:05,930
- That guy?
- That's him.

1301
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,420
He's innocent.

1302
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,015
Have him extradited,
give him a fair trial.

1303
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,660
That's between two countries.

1304
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,619
- I can't decide that.
- But you have to.

1305
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,056
Aren't you a general?

1306
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:20,251
A true general
doesn't only kill who he wants.

1307
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,730
He saves who he wishes.

1308
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,416
Man!

1309
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,813
Go to the French Concession...

1310
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,653
- ...and bring that....
- Ma Zouri.

1311
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:33,619
Ma Zouri. Bring him to me. Alive.

1312
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,654
Also, don't marry
any more concubines.

1313
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:40,460
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing.

1314
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,613
The French mock
the concubine tradition.

1315
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,100
They are just jealous!

1316
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,571
They talk about science and democracy,
but they think like perverts.

1317
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,259
One request a day! What will it be?

1318
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,857
Concubine for me or Ma Zouri for you?

1319
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:58,733
- Ma Zouri.
- Okay. Deal.

1320
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:00,735
Sit.

1321
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,980
Little Six...

1322
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:08,375
...I'm getting old,
and you are grown up.

1323
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:15,535
I want to let you in on a few secrets.

1324
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,535
My heart will always be
in your mother's stomach.

1325
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:22,131
You think I like having concubines?

1326
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,258
Wrong! It's exhausting.

1327
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,612
- Carry on.
- These concubines...

1328
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:30,249
...are strategic assets.
If I don't marry them...

1329
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:34,057
...some other warlords will. They'll
form new alliances through them...

1330
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,620
...and threaten our power base.

1331
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,660
I've faced death for this family.

1332
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:43,936
For your future,
I'd wed all the concubines in the world.

1333
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,172
No regrets. It's all strategy.

1334
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,457
Are you with me?

1335
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:54,459
Ma Zouri! Don't forget!

1336
01:26:57,220 --> 01:27:00,292
- Hello? Bonjour.
<i>- Bonjour my ass. It's me.</i>

1337
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,292
My baby general.

1338
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,417
Witnesses and evidence
are all lined up.

1339
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:07,539
<i>I've dealt with my father and sister.
How's the extradition coming?</i>

1340
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:10,977
Local and international press
are invited.

1341
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,177
I have one concern, your sister.

1342
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,855
She may be dragged through the mud.

1343
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,256
What if she is? Big deal.

1344
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:22,457
This is a major event.

1345
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,340
<i>We should film it.</i>

1346
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,811
Like we'll film Ma Zouri's execution.

1347
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,449
Extradition, execution, movie.

1348
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,657
Three birds with one stone.

1349
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,380
You are a better strategist
than your father.

1350
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:39,216
- And a better filmmaker than your sister.
- Still not as wicked as you!

1351
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,580
- Am I wicked?
- Nasty.

1352
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:44,733
<i>Do I have the face of a villain?</i>

1353
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:49,534
Now, Ma Zouri,
he was born looking evil!

1354
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,739
You need to look presentable
tomorrow.

1355
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:56,780
Once extradited, I can at least
guarantee you'll get a fair trial.

1356
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:00,299
But you have to act humble.
The press will be there.

1357
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,572
My old man needs it to go well.

1358
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,499
Be upbeat, but don't smile!

1359
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:09,416
The extradition is a major bilateral event.
The French like to be wooed, not wowed!

1360
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,891
Use your brain, not your mouth.

1361
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:21,889
Did that hurt?

1362
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,097
- Did it?
- Yes.

1363
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,656
Just remember
what you can and can't say.

1364
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:28,493
No bullshitting!

1365
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,891
Let Chinese people
handle our own affairs!

1366
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,019
Chinese criminals
should be tried by the Chinese!

1367
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,698
Let Chinese people
handle our own affairs!

1368
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,372
Ladies and gentlemen!

1369
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:55,660
Today!

1370
01:29:56,180 --> 01:30:00,015
Today is history!

1371
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:04,693
Today we make history!

1372
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:11,209
And today, we are part of history!

1373
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,415
"Extradition a ruse!"

1374
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:17,652
"Cover-up affair
between killer and Wu-Six!"

1375
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,780
"Personal desires sink public interest!"

1376
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,613
You're just a sissy with a beard!

1377
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,575
Extradition was meant
to be a show of force.

1378
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,853
No, we've become a joke!

1379
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:32,296
Your bloody wedding!
Had I known about this...

1380
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,735
...I would've banned
all your concubines.

1381
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,892
Teacher Qi....

1382
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:41,292
Concubines come and go.
You are forever.

1383
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,294
Tomorrow, in an interview,
I'll deny the rumours.

1384
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,460
Moron! Denial only spreads rumours!

1385
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,771
- What should I do?
- Sit!

1386
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:52,140
Sit!

1387
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,852
Let's play along.
You want to save Ma Zouri?

1388
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,580
We'll execute him!

1389
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,859
What's going on?

1390
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,660
Why is Ma Zouri in the stable?

1391
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:06,176
At least the French put him in a cell.

1392
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:10,177
- Here.
- You believe this trash?

1393
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,332
Others do!

1394
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,892
Let them! Who cares?

1395
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,974
Dad, at your wedding,
can you pardon all prisoners?

1396
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:24,578
That's a thought. Inform the press...

1397
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,811
...that you'll grant an amnesty...

1398
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:29,211
- ...except for Ma Zouri.
- Why?

1399
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:31,656
- After the wedding, he'll be executed.
- What?

1400
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,812
Think big picture.

1401
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:37,178
- You don't love him.
- Shut up!

1402
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:40,297
Who's talking about love? Mother.

1403
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,531
Please!

1404
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,056
Dad, you promised!

1405
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:49,931
Life changes like the weather.

1406
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,569
- Get out, you two!
- Teacher Qi!

1407
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,856
Out!

1408
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:57,297
Listen to your mom.
She's the brains here.

1409
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:00,020
Sweetie. Let's talk.

1410
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,534
Come here.

1411
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,457
Sit down. I have something
to say to you.

1412
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,531
You are my only daughter.

1413
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:15,576
In this world, I love you most.

1414
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:21,056
When I was young,
I was a beauty too.

1415
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,657
With a waist so small,
it could be broken with one hand.

1416
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,812
Many gentlemen proposed...

1417
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:32,011
...but I liked the "lost puppy" type.

1418
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:35,139
- Thought I could save them.
- Was Dad a "lost puppy"?

1419
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,338
God, no! He's just a dumb soldier!

1420
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:42,255
But he won me. Why? I chose him!

1421
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,016
He had a future. And money.
And power.

1422
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,179
I didn't pick a man for me...

1423
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:51,492
- ...but a father for you.
- Mom.

1424
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:55,131
Stop guilting me.
I didn't ask to be born.

1425
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:59,613
Besides, I wouldn't brag about that.

1426
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,294
It's revolting.

1427
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,137
It's opportunism.

1428
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,974
No, it's the natural order!

1429
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,780
Have you read Huxley's
<i>Evolution and Ethics?</i>

1430
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:13,934
The Manchus were still in power. How'd
you know Dad would be a general?

1431
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,174
- I had a vision.
- What if Ma succeeds one day?

1432
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,014
I knew him as a child.

1433
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:24,218
A bum if I have ever seen one!

1434
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:29,018
Mom, have you ever been in love?

1435
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:34,455
Love? A brief hormonal rush.

1436
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,092
But I like that rush.

1437
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:41,298
A moment of joy you've never known.

1438
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:45,010
Please! I said the same things
to my mother.

1439
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:48,896
A woman will pick one of two types:

1440
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:51,211
Rich and powerful.

1441
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:53,736
Or dreamy and desirable.

1442
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,540
What's Ma Zouri?

1443
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:59,380
Rich and powerful? Not really.

1444
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,850
- Dreamy and desirable?
- I like him.

1445
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:04,137
I want to help him.
I won't see him suffer.

1446
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:07,896
What do you know? You're new to men.

1447
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,780
Talk to me again...

1448
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:13,217
...after you've bedded 40 of them.
My understanding...

1449
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,100
...comes from cumulative experience!

1450
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,217
You? With your looks? Forty men?

1451
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:21,049
It's a metaphor!
Four, forty, what's the difference?

1452
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:23,974
What have you done?
Slept with him?

1453
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,416
Kissed? Held hands?

1454
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,614
Mother. The other day, Dad said...

1455
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,693
...concubines were tactics.

1456
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,898
Today, you say sex is a strategy.

1457
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:40,492
You're one of a kind!

1458
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,456
Come back when you've grown up!

1459
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:49,537
Murder. Captured. Extradition.

1460
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,931
You made the front page three times.

1461
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,138
Your execution tomorrow
will make it four.

1462
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:58,135
You've charmed many ladies.

1463
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,374
Including my sister.

1464
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,853
I really wanted you
as my brother-in-law.

1465
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,251
But you had to choose death.

1466
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:10,093
Look at you!

1467
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:12,456
A murderer's face.

1468
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:17,291
Why couldn't you have
a friendly face like Xiang?

1469
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,454
You say you're innocent?
Your face says different!

1470
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:25,616
And your name, Ma, it's too short!

1471
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:28,090
And now you've fallen short.

1472
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:32,095
Inspector Xiang's name is powerful!

1473
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:35,618
It has four letters!

1474
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:38,492
Five.

1475
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:39,650
Five?

1476
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,580
- Five.
- Are you freaking kidding me?

1477
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,699
Why correct my math
at a time like this?

1478
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,498
I'll be delighted to watch you die,
Mr. Ma.

1479
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:57,619
You've finally learned
to call me "mister."

1480
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:01,659
Wu Danian, do you take
Katerina Sergejevna Ivanova...

1481
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,413
...to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1482
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,659
Wu Danian, do you take Katerina...

1483
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:08,413
...to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1484
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,811
- I do.
- I do.

1485
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,300
I do.

1486
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,376
Katerina Sergejevna Ivanova,
do you take Wu Danian...

1487
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,452
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1488
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:20,333
- I do.
- The rings, please.

1489
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,378
Give her the ring.

1490
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:27,456
<i>By the power vested in me by the laws,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

1491
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:31,978
By the power vested in me by the laws,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1492
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,210
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

1493
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,219
On the lips.

1494
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,295
Daughter!

1495
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,175
Pay attention. This is my daughter.

1496
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,298
We've worked up a little treat for you.

1497
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:51,771
- I'm taking him with me.
- Okay.

1498
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:53,977
I don't want to get you in trouble.

1499
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,210
No trouble.

1500
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:06,699
That'd be your alibi. Run!

1501
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,936
Are you luring me somewhere
to shoot me?

1502
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:14,980
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd have done it long ago.

1503
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,290
Step on it!

1504
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,255
Wu-Six!

1505
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:30,778
Stop the car. Let's talk.

1506
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,133
No more talking!

1507
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,259
You have given me a lifetime of lies!

1508
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:41,449
What are you saying?
I'm a revered teacher across China.

1509
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:44,260
I never lied to you!

1510
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:49,051
You read my diary
and expelled the boys I liked.

1511
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:53,419
Well, the joke's on you!

1512
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:57,256
If I hated a boy, I'd put him in my diary.
so you'd expel him!

1513
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:01,175
Insolent twit, I spilled my guts to you.

1514
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,771
Too bad!

1515
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,219
Maybe you shouldn't have slept
with 40 men! It taught you nothing!

1516
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,816
Your wife slept with 40 men?

1517
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,255
Your wife!

1518
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:16,494
Did you go see Ma Zouri last night?

1519
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,698
I did go see him,
but I didn't sleep with him.

1520
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,533
Because I love him!

1521
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:24,579
Ma Zouri is garbage!

1522
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:27,380
How can I shut her up?
How can I shut her up?

1523
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:30,016
- You want to kill her?
- I want to silence the horn!

1524
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,330
- Are you a good shot?
- No.

1525
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,490
Aim at your mother!

1526
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:35,255
- What if I shoot her by accident?
- She's safe.

1527
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,779
There's another car between us.

1528
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:42,494
Aim at the driver and shoot!

1529
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,213
I hit it!

1530
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:48,020
Instead of the driver,
you shot the hood off.

1531
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:50,615
One, two, three!

1532
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,132
- Is your mother still there?
- I shot the horn!

1533
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,730
Keep shooting!

1534
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,819
I've told you to repent.

1535
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:00,412
But I'm telling you now, it's too late.

1536
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:01,570
Keep shooting!

1537
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,937
Mother, please don't move...

1538
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,250
...I may shoot you!

1539
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:08,260
Wu-Six, you're taking potshots at me?

1540
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,695
She's still talking. Quickly!

1541
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:13,098
Let's sever our ties...

1542
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:16,180
...once and for all.

1543
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:22,850
Mother, go ahead and kill me!

1544
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:25,216
The Wu women are Valkyries!

1545
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,135
- What does that mean?
- My bitches are tough.

1546
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,412
I'll run off alone.

1547
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,015
- Go apologise to your mother!
- Damn you!

1548
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,819
What mother shoots at her daughter?

1549
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,449
- I don't deserve you.
- Go to hell!

1550
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,812
Save yourself!

1551
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:04,892
Come back! Come back!

1552
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,580
Come back or I'll shoot!

1553
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,857
I'll shoot you!

1554
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,375
Ma Zouri, wake up!

1555
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:28,769
Told you not to run.

1556
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:35,176
<i>Last time I ran away,
it was because Wanyan died.</i>

1557
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:40,734
<i>But this time, I run because
I don't want Wu-Six to be killed.</i>

1558
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:44,579
- Why'd you shoot me?
- I didn't.

1559
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:45,935
Don't die.

1560
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:48,217
They'll think I killed you.

1561
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:49,734
Wake up!

1562
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,369
You wouldn't have shot me, I know.

1563
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:55,091
You're trying to help me. Water....

1564
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,890
If you die, I'll kill myself.

1565
01:43:58,380 --> 01:43:59,450
I'll shoot myself.

1566
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,414
Please don't.

1567
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:04,095
You're not that kind of person, Wanyan.

1568
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:05,695
I'm not Wanyan.

1569
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:09,975
I know. You're Wu-Six.

1570
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:14,338
- Wake up! We're out of gas!
- I know. Run!

1571
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,412
- Run?
- Hurry!

1572
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,294
- Why'd we stop?
- Out of gas.

1573
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,860
- What do we do?
- I'll fill it up.

1574
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:48,537
Wu-Six, are we going to die?

1575
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:54,210
- You scared?
- I should've died long ago.

1576
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:57,573
Ma Zouri, I want to die with you.

1577
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:00,295
- Are you willing to die with me?
- I'm not.

1578
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,850
You're unwilling? Why?

1579
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:10,858
Wu-Six, you don't find a man
to die with him.

1580
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:15,173
Live. Be happy.

1581
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:18,139
Wait! Take me with you!

1582
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,738
Why'd you wake up?

1583
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:26,896
Are you a masochist or what?

1584
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:28,653
I'm sorry.

1585
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,698
But what else can I do?

1586
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:32,340
Stay down.

1587
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,017
Wu-Six, farewell.

1588
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:42,009
Here's Ma Zouri!

1589
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:45,252
Shoot me!

1590
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,934
But stay back!

1591
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:49,860
I kidnapped Wu-Six.

1592
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:52,615
She's in there.

1593
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:56,411
Why kidnap her?
Wasn't I on the run?

1594
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:59,300
Where to? Here!

1595
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:02,419
Don't you all want to execute Ma Zouri?

1596
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:04,060
Now's the time.

1597
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:08,738
Why not kill myself?

1598
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,580
That's no way to go.

1599
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:15,133
For Ma Zouri,
it's either kill or be killed.

1600
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:17,019
How can I shoot myself?

1601
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:22,616
Terrible aim! A breeze!

1602
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:25,852
I'm sorry, Wu-Six.

1603
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,852
And also Wu-Seven!

1604
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:31,372
He stole money from his father.

1605
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,054
Asked me to launder it.

1606
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:39,376
I said, "I'll spend it all
on an international hookers' contest!"

1607
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:41,497
Where'd I get all those hookers?

1608
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:44,255
I made them up.

1609
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:48,490
So why you gotta kill Ma Zouri?

1610
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:51,057
Beats me.

1611
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:53,860
Everyone believes I killed Wanyan.

1612
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:56,251
Well, I did.

1613
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:59,174
Here's what happened:

1614
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:03,129
She became president
and wanted to marry me. I declined.

1615
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:08,091
I never thought she'd die.

1616
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:12,698
I would've married her if I knew.

1617
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:15,853
Listen, if somebody
wants to marry you...

1618
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,099
...don't hesitate.

1619
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:22,533
Marry her!
Otherwise, it could cost two lives.

1620
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,971
I survived, but suffered.

1621
01:47:25,420 --> 01:47:27,059
So, what happened...

1622
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:32,614
...on that fateful night? How'd she die?

1623
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:35,053
I'll come clean.

1624
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,210
That night....

1625
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:40,613
That night...

1626
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:43,418
...the snow hushed the night.

1627
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:47,292
The empress dowager summoned me.

1628
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,180
She sat me down and said:

1629
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:52,932
"I need your advice."

1630
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,490
I said, "Again?"

1631
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:14,339
Hey, hey! Come back here!

1632
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:19,660
Just like that, I'm shot dead.

1633
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:22,016
Or so I've been told.

1634
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:27,453
Being dead ain't that different
from being alive.

1635
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:32,451
Just wish I knew
what happened to Wu-Six.

1636
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:37,058
Will someone please find out for me?
