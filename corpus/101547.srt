1
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,196
- So you're going to Washington?
- Yes, ma'am.

2
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,825
My son is sick in a hospital there.

3
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,931
This will be an anxious Christmas for you.

4
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,799
I think this one will do. Let's try this.

5
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,909
- Is it your only son?
- No, ma'am.

6
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:15,278
I had four, but two were killed
and one is a prisoner.

7
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,853
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

8
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:25,152
Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.
I'd go myself if I was any use.

9
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,389
Thank you for the overcoat.

10
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,391
Wait a minute.

11
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:34,497
I hope you find him better.

12
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,763
Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.

13
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,444
Merry Christmas.

14
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,438
Merry Christmas.

15
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:50,819
Mrs. March,
will you sign this so I can get it off?

16
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,584
Why, what's the matter?

17
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,418
When I see things like that poor old man...

18
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,664
...it makes me ashamed
to think how little I do.

19
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,432
But, my dear, you're doing all you can here,
and your husband is there.

20
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,038
Yes, I know.

21
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:14,006
His last son is lying ill, miles away...

22
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,741
...waiting to say goodbye to him,
forever perhaps...

23
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,616
...while I have my four girls to comfort me.

24
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,753
And a real comfort they are, too,
aren't they?

25
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,719
I couldn't bear it without them.

26
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:31,492
- Meg and Jo are working, you know?
- Yes?

27
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,186
Meg is a nursery governess.

28
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,255
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

29
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,697
Merry Christmas.

30
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,835
Remember, Lily,
Santa Claus is watching you.

31
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:43,536
Come on, Tony.

32
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:48,707
"We know as well,
what are the baneful fruits of selfishness...

33
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,907
"...and self-indulgence.
Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity...

34
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,507
"...even in the richest natures.

35
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,344
"They grow...

36
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,483
"...and ripen and bear their fruit...

37
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,525
"...like southern vines and weeds...

38
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,920
"...almost...

39
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,799
"...in a single day and night.

40
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:17,101
"Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly
from their very first appearance...

41
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,268
"...and do not weary...

42
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:23,607
"...of the labor of plucking them out...

43
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:27,605
"...again and again."

44
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,650
Goodbye, goodbye!

45
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:37,157
Hold your tongue,
you disrespectful old bird!

46
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:39,754
Go on, Josephine.

47
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:48,734
Josephine!

48
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,509
Where are you off to, Miss?

49
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,417
I didn't think you'd mind.

50
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,976
It was nearly time to leave
and the girls said they'd be home early...

51
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,353
...so we could rehearse my play
for Christmas.

52
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,824
Never a thought about my Christmas.

53
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:15,330
Flying off without a word of cheer
or greeting for your poor old aunt.

54
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,092
I'm sorry, Aunt March.

55
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,161
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

56
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:22,996
Here.

57
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:32,572
It's a dollar for each. Well, take them.

58
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:33,976
Thank you, Aunty.

59
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,951
Never mind thanking me.
Just spend it wisely, that's all I ask.

60
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:42,647
Although it's more than I can expect
when you're so much like your father...

61
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:47,392
...waltzing off to war and letting
other folks look after his family.

62
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:51,090
There's nobody looking after us.
And we don't ask favors from anybody.

63
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,727
I'm very proud of Father
and you should be, too.

64
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,529
- Don't you be impertinent, Miss.
- I'm sorry, Aunty.

65
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:02,503
It isn't preachers that are going
to win this war. It's fighters!

66
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:03,869
Yes, Aunty.

67
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,613
- Can I go, now?
- Yeah, go on.

68
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,980
- Did you clean Polly's cage today?
- Yes, Aunty.

69
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:12,384
Did you wash those teacups
and put them away carefully?

70
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:13,613
Yes, Aunty.

71
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,748
- You didn't break any?
- No, Aunty.

72
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:18,350
- What about the teaspoons?
- I polished them.

73
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,292
Yes. Very well then.

74
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,431
Wait, just a minute. Come back here.

75
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:30,404
Look at this. You haven't dusted properly.

76
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,806
I want this stair rail dusted and polished
before you leave here.

77
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:36,770
Yes, Aunty.

78
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,439
Higher.

79
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,225
Thank you very much, ladies.

80
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,765
And now I wish you all
a very merry Christmas.

81
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,525
Merry Christmas!

82
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:35,033
School is dismissed.

83
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,144
Amy March! You may close the door.

84
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,217
That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.

85
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,819
- It serves that stuck-up Amy March right.
- What's he going to do to her?

86
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:07,128
I can see there's nothing for me to do
but to stop by and show your mother...

87
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:13,541
...how instead of doing your sums,
you cover your slate with sketches.

88
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:19,342
And most uncomplimentary sketches.

89
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:27,820
Please, Mr. Davis, I'll never do it again, sir.

90
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,959
And she'd be so disappointed in me.

91
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,056
Please.

92
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:36,795
Please.

93
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,367
Well, I should hate to spoil her Christmas...

94
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:43,271
...and for that reason alone, young lady,
I shall overlook it.

95
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,169
Thank you, Mr. Davis!

96
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,172
You may go.

97
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:51,804
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Thank you very much indeed.

98
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,539
Thank you, sir.

99
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:56,051
Here she is.

100
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,853
- What did he do?
- What did he say?

101
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,885
Come on, tell us. What happened?

102
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:06,185
I just said that if I ever told my mother
the way he treated me...

103
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,729
...she'd take me out of his old school.

104
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,258
She's never been "reconciliated" anyway...

105
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:15,360
...since my father lost his money
and she's had to suffer the "degaridation"...

106
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,268
...of me being thrown in
with a lot of ill-mannered girls...

107
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,138
...who stick their noses
in refined people's business.

108
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:56,835
Little tiny pussy, I'll tell you a long story.

109
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,007
- Hannah, is it teatime?
- Yes.

110
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,407
- I'll set the table.
- Thank you, Beth.

111
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,317
It'll be a help to me
'cause my bread's raised.

112
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,788
The girls are getting home early.

113
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,294
- Are they coming?
- Just passing the Laurence house.

114
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,835
- Christopher Columbus!
- Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions.

115
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,365
Here comes old Mr. Laurence.
What if he heard you?

116
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:26,600
I don't care. I like good strong words
that mean something.

117
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,405
Oh, bother.
Now we're going to have to speak to him.

118
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,447
How do?

119
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,051
It makes my knees chatter
just to look at him.

120
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:42,155
I feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone
with such an ogre for a grandfather.

121
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,493
- Look, there he is.
- Where?

122
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,759
Don't point, Jo.
He'll think you're waving at him.

123
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,594
He's gone anyway. Well, what if he does?

124
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,298
Jo! Come along, Amy.

125
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,684
- How's my Beth?
- It's cold outside!

126
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,085
Jo just did the most terrible thing.

127
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,748
Beth, come over here.

128
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,792
- He waved at us.
- Is tea ready yet?

129
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:24,261
Merry Christmas from Aunt March.

130
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,838
- For me?
- Yes, darling, for you.

131
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,130
We got one, too.

132
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,868
- What are you going to do with it, dear?
- I don't know.

133
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:36,706
Marmee said we ought not
to spend money for pleasure...

134
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:39,042
...when our men are suffering so
in the Army.

135
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:43,775
A dollar couldn't do the Army much good,
so I'm going to buy <i>Undine and Sintram</i>.

136
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,514
I've wanted it long enough.

137
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,385
I'm sure Marmee would approve
if I got some new gloves.

138
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,120
I've darned my old ones
until I can hardly get them on.

139
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:55,823
She always says a real lady is known
by her neat gloves and boots.

140
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:00,934
I shall get a nice box of Faber's
drawing pencils. I really need them.

141
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,566
Then I'd like to spend mine
for some new music...

142
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,743
...that is,
if you don't think Marmee would mind.

143
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,809
Let's each buy what we want
and have a little fun.

144
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,177
I'm sure we work hard enough.

145
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:19,446
I know I do.
It's not the work I mind so much.

146
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:23,114
It's having to tell Flo King
how pretty she looks...

147
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:25,489
...in things I know would look
as well on me.

148
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:29,357
What would you do if you were shut up
all day with an old crosspatch...

149
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,729
...who flies off the handle
every move you make?

150
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,859
Jo, don't use slang.

151
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,668
Besides, don't forget
she gave us the dollar.

152
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,539
I'm sure neither of you suffer as I do.

153
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,844
You don't have to go
to that nasty old Davis' school...

154
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:48,076
...with impertinent girls who laugh at you
and "label" your father 'cause he isn't rich.

155
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,676
"Libel." Don't say "label"
as if Papa were a pickle bottle.

156
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:56,014
I know what I mean
and you needn't be "statirical" about it.

157
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,758
It's proper to use good words
and improve your "vocabilary."

158
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,921
Aren't we elegant?

159
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,192
You'd never be thought so with your slang.

160
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,325
I hope not. I don't want to be elegant.

161
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:09,029
- You needn't whistle like a boy.
- That's why I do it.

162
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,798
- I detest rude, unladylike girls.
- And I hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks.

163
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:17,369
Birds in their little nests agree.

164
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,755
Really, you're both to blame.

165
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:33,791
You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks
and behave better, Josephine.

166
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:38,493
Now you are so tall and turn up your hair,
you must remember you're a young lady.

167
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:43,163
No, I'm not. And if turning up my hair
makes me so, I'll wear it down till I'm 100.

168
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,398
Jo!

169
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,733
As for you, Amy, your absurd words
are as bad as Jo's slang.

170
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,973
Your airs are funny now,
but you'll grow into an affected goose...

171
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:54,809
...unless you take care.

172
00:13:55,217 --> 00:14:00,245
If Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose,
what am I, please?

173
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:04,091
You're a dear and nothing else.

174
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:08,422
We're three ungrateful wretches
who don't deserve you.

175
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:12,597
Wait until I become a famous author
and make my fortune.

176
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,829
Then we'll all ride in fine carriages,
dressed like Flo King...

177
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:20,034
...snubbing Amy's friends and telling
Aunt March to go to the dickens.

178
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,166
Let's rehearse.

179
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:26,437
We'll start with the fainting scene.
You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy.

180
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:29,916
Well, I can't help it.
I've never seen anyone faint...

181
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,978
...and I don't intend to make myself
black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do.

182
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,250
It's easy if you'll only watch me. Come on.

183
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:40,192
- Lf I can drop gracefully, I'll...
- Now, when I come in...

184
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:44,355
...you'll see the horrible look in my eyes
and you shrink back trembling.

185
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:45,700
Go ahead.

186
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,867
Get into the mood, Amy.

187
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,072
Now, when I start toward you,
with wicked intentions...

188
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,181
Oh, Amy, you...

189
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:09,657
...draw back in horror,
covering your eyes with your hands.

190
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,925
"Roderigo, Roderigo!

191
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,489
"Save me, save me!"

192
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,199
There, now you see? Now, it's easy.

193
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,400
Now, here I come.

194
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:33,245
"Roderigo, Roderigo!

195
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,310
"Save me, save me!"

196
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,189
- You were marvelous.
- That was lovely.

197
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,462
Glad to find you so merry, my girls.

198
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,106
- Darling.
- Marmee.

199
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,874
- How is your cold, Meg?
- Much better.

200
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,674
Beth, dear, kiss me, baby.

201
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,244
Thank you, Jo. Thank you, dear.

202
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:15,079
- You look tired to death, Jo.
- No, Marmee, I'm not tired.

203
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,818
- Your slippers are all ready now.
- That's my Bethie, dearie.

204
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,589
Did you have a hard day, Marmee?

205
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,790
No, very pleasant, dear.
But it's good to be home.

206
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,799
- I have a treat for you.
- A letter from Father?

207
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,130
Three cheers for Father.

208
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:35,304
"Give them all my dear love and a kiss.

209
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,809
"Tell them I know they will remember
all I said to them:

210
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:43,246
"That they will be loving children to you...

211
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:47,914
"...they will do their duty faithfully,
fight their bosom enemies bravely...

212
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:51,151
"...and conquer themselves so beautifully...

213
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,424
"...that when I come back to them,
I may be fonder and prouder than ever...

214
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,396
"...of my little women."

215
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:04,201
I am a selfish girl...

216
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:10,341
...but I'll truly try to be better
and not waste my time in school...

217
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,674
...so that Father
may not be disappointed in me.

218
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:22,355
I'll try and be what he loves to call me,
"a little woman"...

219
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:27,722
...and not be rough and wild,
and do my duty here at home...

220
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:32,361
...instead of always wanting
to go to war to help Father.

221
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,469
I'm not going to be envious anymore,
if I can help it.

222
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,619
Now, we'll save the rest till after tea...

223
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:57,622
...for it's such a lovely long letter.
I know everybody must be hungry.

224
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,336
Let's get something for Marmee
with our dollar...

225
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,997
...instead of for ourselves, shall we?

226
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,905
That's like you, Beth. What shall we get?

227
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,773
- I'll get her a nice pair of gloves.
- New slippers, best to be had.

228
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:19,542
Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed.

229
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:24,479
A beautiful little bottle of cologne.
She'll like that, and it won't cost much...

230
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:27,487
...and then I'll have some left over
for my pencils.

231
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:32,490
I've finished with Asia.

232
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,027
And here is Europe.

233
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:37,795
- Three stitches and you can have Africa.
- Not too long stitches, dear.

234
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,198
If you pass me the scissors,
I'll give you America.

235
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,532
There, you see? You did finish it after all.

236
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,868
You wanted to put it off until tomorrow.

237
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:47,806
But we never should have
if Jo hadn't made a game of it...

238
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,073
...and thought of talking
of the different countries as we worked.

239
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,613
It was a nice idea, Jo.

240
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:57,377
Do you remember how you used to play
<i>Pilgrim 's Progress</i> when you were little?

241
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:02,349
I can see us all now with your ragbags
tied over our backs for burdens.

242
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:06,291
You have real burdens now,
instead of ragbags.

243
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:10,495
According to what I heard before tea,
except Beth.

244
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:13,259
She didn't say. Maybe she hasn't any.

245
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:14,894
Yes, I have.

246
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:20,668
Mine is dishes and dusters
and being afraid of people...

247
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,406
...and envying girls with nice pianos.

248
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:25,241
A piano is a burden.

249
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,328
Good night, my precious.

250
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:16,358
Good night, Marmee.

251
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,527
- Good night, Jo, my girl.
- Good night, Marmee.

252
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,729
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, my baby.

253
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,169
- Good night, Marmee.
- Good night, Bethie.

254
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,326
- Merry Christmas, Hannah.
- Merry Christmas!

255
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:54,560
Where's Marmee?

256
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,467
She just went down the street,
but she'll be right back.

257
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:01,440
She wants you to have your breakfast
when I can get it dished up.

258
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,443
Come round here.

259
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,276
Hide them. Get close.

260
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,289
- Where have you been, Amy?
- What have you been doing?

261
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,991
Don't laugh, Jo.

262
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,686
I only changed the little bottle of cologne...

263
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:25,455
...for a big one.
I gave all my money to get it.

264
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,198
- Amy.
- Darling.

265
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,528
That was unselfish of you.

266
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,964
You're some pumpkins, Amy.

267
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:37,972
I felt ashamed, thinking only of myself.

268
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:40,510
Amy, my prettiest rose.

269
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:45,917
And I'm so glad,
because mine is the handsomest now.

270
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:52,055
- Where is Marmee?
- She'll be back any minute. Breakfast!

271
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,720
- Hannah, I'm so hungry.
- Hannah, what is it?

272
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:56,790
Sausages!

273
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,429
Popovers!

274
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,261
They are my favorites!

275
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,234
Coffee!

276
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,742
Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch.

277
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,744
No need to make such a fuss about it.

278
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:14,111
I remember when I used to serve it
on your father's table every day.

279
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,114
No?

280
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,247
- Hannah, were we really that rich?
- How was I dressed?

281
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,515
I'd like to tell Jenny Snow
all the pretty clothes I used to wear.

282
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,524
- I can tell her. Diapers!
- Jo!

283
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,924
Two each.

284
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,826
- Isn't this marvelous?
- Look at all the popovers.

285
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,954
She's coming!

286
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:32,329
Hurry, Beth, strike up.
Amy, open the door.

287
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,426
Come here, Meg. We'll cover these up
and it'll be a surprise.

288
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:41,806
Enter, Marmee.

289
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:57,223
- Merry Christmas, Marmee!
- Merry Christmas, my...

290
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:05,298
Oh, darling!

291
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,833
Oh, Meg, dear! Thank you!

292
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:14,075
And handkerchiefs from Bethie. Thank you.

293
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,940
Hannah, did you see?

294
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,346
Amy, my precious, thank you!

295
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:22,476
These are from me.

296
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:25,009
Jo, my girl.

297
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,645
Thank you, darlings. Thank you.

298
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,223
Oh, my girls.

299
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:35,521
I can't tell you how happy I am.

300
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:43,400
Well, I can tell you how hungry I am.
Come on, everyone. Pass me those plates.

301
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,406
- Sit down, Marmee.
- Marmee, look! Sausages.

302
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,867
Wait a minute, girls.

303
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:52,138
I want to say one word before we begin.

304
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:56,514
I've just come from a poor woman
with a little newborn baby...

305
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:02,051
...and six children huddled into one bed
to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.

306
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:04,988
They are suffering cold and hunger.

307
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:10,594
My girls, will you give them your breakfast
as a Christmas present?

308
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:16,001
I'm so glad you came back
before we started.

309
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:17,867
I knew you would.

310
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,506
May I carry some things?

311
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:21,735
We shall all go. Take the coffee, Hannah.

312
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:24,038
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll take the cream.

313
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,977
I'll take the bread.

314
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:29,381
I'll take the popovers.

315
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,647
Here we are, Mrs. Hummel.

316
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,629
<i>Gott in Himmel.</i> Good angels come to us.

317
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,592
Funny angels, in hoods and mittens.

318
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,635
Do you want some bread to eat?
Here, I'll give you some bread.

319
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,545
Strange that Roderigo is not here.

320
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:35,874
His note says "promptly on the hour."

321
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:40,883
"And why..."

322
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,392
And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst?

323
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:47,893
I am afraid.

324
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,130
Who comes here?

325
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:55,199
Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag.

326
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,704
Black Hugo hath betrayed thee.

327
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,337
I must fly.

328
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,346
Zara will be waiting.

329
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,576
My proud beauty!

330
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
She will be mine!

331
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,924
Black Hugo approaches.

332
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:25,260
Withered crone, begone!

333
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,339
Roderigo, Roderigo!

334
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,875
Save me, save me!

335
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:54,084
And now to carry out my fell design.

336
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:01,962
What a fake.

337
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,233
Well, I told you
I wasn't going to make myself...

338
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:13,409
Have pity. Oh, have pity!

339
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:16,808
Bring not upon me the worst of shame!

340
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:21,411
Silence, else you'll rue the day
you spurned Black Hugo's love.

341
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:27,217
Make thyself ready for the wedding.
I shall return within the quarter.

342
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:29,461
Ah, me!

343
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:33,257
Heaven protect the helpless!

344
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:38,800
Zara! My beloved!

345
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,968
Roderigo, durst I believe my eyes?

346
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:50,073
"The pale stars are twinkling

347
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,681
"The fair moon is rising above

348
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,990
"My guitar is tinkling

349
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:07,664
"But the notes are not sweet
Till they bring me my love"

350
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,199
Courage, my fair.

351
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:19,213
The good padre waits
at yonder gate with the horses.

352
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:21,975
See, the ladder. All is arranged.

353
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,387
Liberty! Fly with me.
Fly with me, my love.

354
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,287
I will assist you. I will...

355
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,364
It's all right, everyone.
Stay where you are.

356
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:52,406
Young ladies.

357
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:56,016
Will you all please come in to supper?

358
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:13,667
Christopher Columbus! What's this?

359
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:15,065
Is it fairies?

360
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,100
- It's Santa Claus?
- Mother did it?

361
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:21,733
- Aunt March had a good fit and sent it?
- All wrong. Mr. Laurence sent it.

362
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,176
- No!
- Who is Mr. Laurence?

363
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,747
The Laurence boy's grandfather.
He lives next door.

364
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,043
He heard what you did
about your breakfast...

365
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:30,709
...and sent me a nice note...

366
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,016
...saying he hoped I'd allow him to express
his friendly feeling toward my children...

367
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,853
...and send them a few trifles
in honor of the day.

368
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,729
The boy put it into his head, I know he did.

369
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:46,858
He looks like a capital fellow
and I'm dying to get acquainted.

370
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,596
I'm going to, too.

371
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,031
I wish Father were here.

372
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm afraid he isn't having
such a merry Christmas as we are.

373
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:28,774
Hello.

374
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,071
How do you do?

375
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:32,409
I wanted to thank you.

376
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:36,075
We did have such a good time
over your nice Christmas present.

377
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,648
What's the matter? Are you sick?

378
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:42,085
Just a little cold, but grandfather's
made me stop indoors for a week.

379
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,680
That's too bad.

380
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,283
Can anybody come to see you?

381
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,822
If they would.

382
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,763
Wait, I'll ask Marmee.
Close the window now.

383
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,812
- How do you do, Miss March?
- How do you do, Mr. Laurence?

384
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:13,417
Mother was so sorry to hear
that you'd been ill.

385
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:15,648
My sister, Meg,
sent you some of her blancmange.

386
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,851
It's soft and will slide down easily
without hurting your throat.

387
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,824
Thank you.

388
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:22,921
And Beth lent you these until you're well.

389
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:31,631
I know boys don't like kittens,
but she was so anxious I couldn't refuse.

390
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:35,197
Maybe they'll help to liven things up.
It's as dull as tombs over here.

391
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,145
Won't you come in?

392
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,077
No, I'm not to stay.

393
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,586
Please. Just for a few minutes.
I've ordered tea.

394
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,566
Christopher Columbus!

395
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,364
What richness!

396
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:09,071
It's just like summer!

397
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:11,611
This is marvelous!

398
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,712
It's so roomy.

399
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,079
How many, please?

400
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,217
Two, please. Three.

401
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,481
How do you like it here after living
in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence?

402
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,754
I'm going to Europe.

403
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:29,058
- Really? When?
- I don't know.

404
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,894
My aunt has rheumatism
and the doctor thought the baths...

405
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:34,696
Not that she hasn't a bath.
She has a very nice one.

406
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,862
Did you take any baths
while you were there?

407
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:40,339
- I mean, for rheumatism.
- No, I'm not troubled with rheumatism.

408
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:43,571
Neither am I. But she thought
that baths wouldn't do me any harm.

409
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:46,112
I mean, that is to say, while I was there.

410
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,808
You see,
I've always wanted to go to Europe.

411
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,476
Not for the baths, of course,
but for my writing.

412
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:54,578
You see, my aunt...
But you don't know Aunt March, do you?

413
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,351
Well, never mind.
What were you saying, Mr. Laurence?

414
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,760
I'm not Mr. Laurence. I'm only Laurie.

415
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:03,524
Laurie.

416
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,559
How do you like it here after Europe?

417
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:09,565
It's strange
after living in schools all my life...

418
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,470
...but it will be all right
when I get used to Grandfather.

419
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,905
You know, he...

420
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:17,737
Yes, you should have seen him
before you came.

421
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:21,441
- Isn't he a holy terror?
- You ought to see Aunt March.

422
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,346
It's too pretty to eat.
I wish we had things like this over here.

423
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,153
And I wish...

424
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,787
It is nice, isn't it?

425
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:35,990
My little sister put on the geranium leaves.
She's very artistic.

426
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:38,794
- Amy?
- Yes. How do you know?

427
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,801
I often hear you calling to one another...

428
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:46,034
...and when I'm alone over here...

429
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,804
I beg your pardon for being so rude...

430
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,806
...but sometimes you forget
to put down the curtains...

431
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:59,248
...and when the lamps are lighted,
it's like looking at a picture...

432
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:02,288
...to see you all around the table
with your mother.

433
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,791
You always seem to be having
such good times.

434
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,793
We'll never draw that curtain anymore.

435
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:12,725
And I give you leave
to look as much as you like.

436
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,735
I wish instead of just peeping,
you'd come over and see us.

437
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:17,834
We'd have jolly times together.

438
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:21,807
Would you let me be in a play?
I saw some of it the other night.

439
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:23,475
That was terrible.

440
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:26,045
I want to put on <i>Hamlet</i>
and do the fencing scene.

441
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:29,015
I could play Laertes.
I took fencing lessons at the academy.

442
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,277
- Really?
- Yes, look.

443
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:33,217
Look. <i>En garde!</i>

444
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:36,253
- Splendid!
- Here.

445
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,690
"Come, for the third, Laertes,
you but dally."

446
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:41,421
"Say you so? Come on."

447
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:47,664
- "Another hit; what say you?"
- "A touch, a touch, I do confess."

448
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,430
What is this? What on earth?

449
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:54,871
What's going on?

450
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:56,707
I don't know, sir.

451
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,545
"Have at you now!"

452
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:02,638
I say...

453
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,178
- Are you hurt?
- No.

454
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:08,213
- No, nothing ever hurts me.
- I'm sorry.

455
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:11,349
I forgot you were a girl
and I'm afraid I got a bit too rough.

456
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:15,555
What are you talking about?
I had you bettered if I hadn't slipped.

457
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,930
That's a good picture of your grandfather.

458
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,801
He looks pretty grim,
but I shouldn't be afraid of him.

459
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,266
Though I can see how his face
might frighten some people.

460
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,980
I'll wait upstairs, sir.

461
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:40,581
His eyes are kind and I like him
even though he does bark at you so.

462
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:42,914
Thank you, ma'am.

463
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,593
So you're not afraid of me?

464
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:51,163
No, sir, not much.

465
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,894
But my face will frighten some people?

466
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:59,430
- I only said "might."
- And I bark, do I?

467
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,765
No, sir, perhaps not all the time.

468
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,436
But with all that, you like me?

469
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,743
Yes, sir. I do.

470
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,573
I do.

471
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,443
And I like you.

472
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:21,089
Grandfather, you should see her fence.
Come on, let's show him.

473
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:24,256
- No. I've been here too long now.
- I'll see you home.

474
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:29,233
No, you stay indoors, young man.
I shall see Miss March home.

475
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,965
I want to pay my respects
to your mother...

476
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,530
...and thank her for the medicine
she sent my boy.

477
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,702
I can see it's done him lots of good.

478
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:43,414
You get upstairs and do your sums.
Brooke is waiting for you.

479
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:46,419
And see that you behave yourself
like a gentleman, sir.

480
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,852
Goodbye, Jo.

481
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,624
Here they come.

482
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:57,186
All dressed up
and looking as pretty as pictures.

483
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,061
Amy, how dainty. You look lovely.

484
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:08,803
I wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party.
I know I shall be frightened.

485
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:12,301
You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings
when he's been so kind.

486
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,174
Meg, the dress is lovely.

487
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,411
Thank you, Marmee.

488
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,078
Jo, you look splendid.

489
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,521
I feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins...

490
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:28,619
...all sticking straight into my head,
but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.

491
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:30,163
Does the patch show much?

492
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:31,755
It does a little, Marmee.

493
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,599
But she's going to sit down or else stand
with her back against the wall.

494
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,534
Jo, where are your gloves?

495
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,707
I've stained them, so I'm going without.

496
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,605
You wear gloves or I don't go.

497
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,406
I tried to clean them,
but it only made them look worse.

498
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,380
I'll carry them
and hold them crumpled up in one hand.

499
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:50,440
- Nobody will see them.
- Jo!

500
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:54,249
I'll tell you.
We'll each wear one of your nice ones...

501
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:58,486
...and carry one of my bad ones,
then the effect will be fine and easy.

502
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:02,759
All right, only be careful of it,
and don't stretch it.

503
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:07,799
And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely
and don't put your hands behind your back.

504
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,531
Good night, Marmee.

505
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,197
Above everything, don't say:
"Christopher Columbus!"...

506
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:13,706
...and disgrace us all.

507
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:15,799
Hold your tongue, Miss Baby.

508
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:20,108
I'll be as prim as I can be and not get into
any scrapes, if I can help it.

509
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,097
May I engage you for this dance,
Miss March?

510
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,293
No, thank you, I'm not dancing.

511
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:28,738
- There's that Kitty Ford.
- Where?

512
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,875
There in the pink dress and blue sash.

513
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:35,285
I don't see why she's allowed with
the grownups and I have to stay up here.

514
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:37,449
That beautiful piano.

515
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:40,456
It's as big as our kitchen.

516
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:47,626
What's this? Why aren't you young ladies
downstairs dancing?

517
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:50,226
Mother said we weren't to go down
with the grownups.

518
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:53,135
But can you see anything from here?
How about you?

519
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,305
She just likes to listen to the music.

520
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,811
You just come down with me
where it's playing.

521
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:02,872
- No, sir, please. I...
- Why not? What's the matter?

522
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,420
She has an infirmity.

523
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:08,780
She's shy.

524
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,218
I see.

525
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:14,085
If it weren't for that,
she'd be simply "fastidious"...

526
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,254
...because she plays beautifully.

527
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,024
She must come and play for me sometime.

528
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,829
No, she never would.

529
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,137
It wasn't that I wanted to hear her.

530
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:28,005
But that piano down there
is simply going to ruin for want of use.

531
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:31,509
I was hoping one of you young ladies
would come and practice on it...

532
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:33,809
...just to keep it in tune.

533
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,947
- But if you don't care to come, never mind.
- Sir.

534
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,253
We do care. Very, very much.

535
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,150
So you're the musical one.

536
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,624
I'm Beth. I love it dearly...

537
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,692
...and I'll come if you're quite sure
nobody will hear me and be disturbed.

538
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,132
Not a soul, my child. Not a soul.

539
00:40:58,172 --> 00:40:59,799
You come, too, young lady...

540
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,799
...and tell your mother I think
all her daughters are simply "fastidious."

541
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,946
Beth, isn't he elegant?

542
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,421
This is the German, and I'll be hanged
if I'll let you refuse me all of them.

543
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:22,894
Don't you like to dance?

544
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:26,330
Yes, I love to dance, but I can't.

545
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:29,731
- I mean, I promised I wouldn't.
- Why?

546
00:41:30,538 --> 00:41:34,065
- I may as well tell you. You won't tell?
- Silence to the death.

547
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,267
You see, I have a bad trick
of standing in front of the fire...

548
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:40,245
...and I scorched my frock
and I burned this one.

549
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:41,674
Where?

550
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:47,144
You can laugh if you want to. It is funny.

551
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,619
I'll tell you how we'll manage.

552
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,694
There's no one in the hall.
We could dance there without being seen.

553
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:04,168
- You're a trump.
- And I think you're just perfectly splendid.

554
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:26,724
Hello.

555
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:29,227
What are you doing up there?
Come on down.

556
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:31,926
No, they can't.

557
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,133
Have you had refreshments?

558
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,605
No, thank you, we really don't care for...

559
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:43,134
We'll bring some right up. Come on.

560
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:47,142
Then when Laurie goes to college,
what becomes of you?

561
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:50,806
I shall turn soldier as soon as he is off.
I am needed.

562
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,310
I'm so sorry.

563
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:01,350
I mean, I'm so sorry
for all the mothers and sisters...

564
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:03,328
...who have to stay home and worry.

565
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:07,196
I have neither and very few friends
to care whether I live or die.

566
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:11,302
Laurie and his grandfather
would care a great deal.

567
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:16,035
And we all would be very sorry
if any harm came to you.

568
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:19,170
Would you?

569
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,808
Here we come.

570
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:24,706
Jo!

571
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:30,253
Now you've done it!

572
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,156
- Look at me.
- It's a shame.

573
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:39,824
What a blunderbuss I am.

574
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,467
What are you going to do?

575
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,629
I'll ask Marmee.

576
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:51,810
Have you two been hiding? I've been
looking all over the house for you.

577
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:53,244
Hannah's here.

578
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:56,281
- Is it that late?
- Time slips away.

579
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:01,020
- Good night, Mr. Brooke.
- Good night, Miss Margaret.

580
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,695
Miss Margaret?

581
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,632
- Goodbye. I'm glad you came.
- We had an elegant time.

582
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,002
Good night, Amy.

583
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,509
Good night.

584
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,077
- Good night, Laurie.
- Good night, Miss Margaret.

585
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:28,273
Laurie!

586
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:30,179
Good night, everybody.

587
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,718
- Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow.
- I won't.

588
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:34,686
- Good night.
- Good night.

589
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,960
There, I've done my best.

590
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:51,467
If that won't do,
I'll have to wait until I can do better.

591
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:35,982
Why, what are you up to?

592
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,887
It's a pair of slippers
I worked for Mr. Laurence.

593
00:45:44,024 --> 00:45:47,482
He's been so kind about letting me play
on his beautiful piano.

594
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:50,324
I didn't know any other way
to thank him, Jo.

595
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,022
- Do you think they're all right?
- They're beautiful.

596
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,866
And I think you're sweet.
Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon?

597
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,471
Yes, but I think
she was going to throw it away.

598
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,099
You think?

599
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:05,037
You'd better vamoose
before she catches you.

600
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:28,427
Now I'll find out why you come
to this hole every day.

601
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:31,027
Is that why you never have
any time for me anymore?

602
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:35,006
Laurie Laurence, give that to me
or I'll never speak to you again!

603
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:37,105
All right, take it.

604
00:46:41,114 --> 00:46:42,445
You're a fine one.

605
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:45,280
I thought we weren't to have any secrets
from each other.

606
00:46:45,352 --> 00:46:48,788
Well, this is altogether different.
I beg your pardon.

607
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:53,316
Of course, it's different. Just like a girl.
Can't keep an agreement.

608
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:54,858
Oh, bilge!

609
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,726
You'll be sorry.

610
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,192
I was going to tell you
something very plummy.

611
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,468
A secret.

612
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,670
All about people you know, and such fun.

613
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:11,039
- What?
- Lf I tell you, you must tell me yours.

614
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:13,170
- You won't say anything at home?
- Not a word.

615
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,013
- You won't tease me about it in private?
- I never tease. Fire away.

616
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,824
I sold my story to the Spread Eagle.

617
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,232
Hurrah for Miss March.

618
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:42,473
Hurrah for Miss March!
The celebrated American authoress!

619
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,841
I didn't want anyone to know until it's out.

620
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:47,710
- Won't it be fun to see it in print?
- Now, what's yours?

621
00:47:47,848 --> 00:47:51,045
- I know where Meg's glove is.
- Is that all?

622
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,143
- Wait till you hear where it is.
- Where?

623
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:56,782
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

624
00:47:56,823 --> 00:47:58,290
- Where?
- Pocket.

625
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:00,292
- All this time?
- Isn't it romantic?

626
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,819
"Romantic"? Rubbish!

627
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:07,192
I never heard of anything so horrid.
I wish you hadn't told me.

628
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,701
Of all the sickly sentimental...

629
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,402
Why do things always have to change
just when they're perfect?

630
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:17,110
Meg always used to tell me everything.
Now she keeps things to herself.

631
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:20,476
She thinks brown eyes are beautiful
and John is a lovely name.

632
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,946
He'd better keep away from me
or I'll tell him what I think of him...

633
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:27,214
...trying to break up other people's
happiness and spoil their fun.

634
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:29,847
It doesn't spoil any fun.
It makes it twice as good.

635
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,615
You'll find out
when someone falls in love with you.

636
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:34,627
Soft summer day.

637
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:37,487
Sun setting through the trees.

638
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,490
Your lover's arms stealing around you.

639
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:44,293
- I'd like to see anybody try it.
- Would you?

640
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:05,047
I'll get you!

641
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,562
Now I've got you.

642
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:11,061
Wait!

643
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,896
Look out, look out! Let me in, let me in!

644
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:19,861
- Hey, look out, Laurie. Don't act like that.
- I'm sorry, Meg.

645
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,602
I'd have beaten her though
if I hadn't tripped and fell.

646
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,374
You should have seen...
