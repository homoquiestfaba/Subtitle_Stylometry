1
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,900
Hello fence!

2
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,292
Hello leaves!

3
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:30,178
Hello sky!

4
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:34,617
Get off my lawn!

5
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:40,943
- Do you want to be eaten alive?
- No...

6
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Then get out of here!

7
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:49,535
My trike?

8
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,800
Stay away from my house!

9
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,800
- D.J. We're gonna be late!
- I'm coming, I'm coming...

10
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,100
October 30th: Another
tricycle. - I'm coming!

11
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,700
Mom, he did it again!
He took another tricycle.

12
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,400
Honey, we've talked about this.
You cannot stay up in your room all day-

13
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
-staring at an old man
through a telescope.

14
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,620
But mom, there's something wrong
with that house. I'm serious...

15
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,199
What was that?

16
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:55,532
- "I'm serious".
-  His voice sounds funny.

17
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,676
Someone is hitting puberty.
"What's happening to my body?"

18
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,019
- Maybe you should come with us?
- The boy is too busy.
He's got his spying to do.

19
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm not spying!

20
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:15,580
That's okay, buddy...
When I was your age
I did exactly the same thing-

21
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,100
- of course it was with binoculars
and involved the lovely Jensen twins.

22
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:22,375
Neither of which were as lovely as
your beautiful mother.

23
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:27,063
Would you be an angel,
and help me bring out the inciser?
- Hold on to this, buddy...

24
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:38,636
Elisabeth will be here in a few hours.
If anything happens call the police-

25
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,157
-and hide in your closet.
- He knows that.

26
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,625
See you tomorrow night!

27
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:46,676
- What have you done!
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?

28
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,400
- Where is D.J?
- You would be so happy-

29
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:56,472
-if he was under the car, wouldn't you?
- Sorry, it's hard to see with the mask on.

30
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,894
Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder.

31
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,950
Why did you put up your window?

32
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,980
- Chowder?
- Hi, D.J!

33
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:11,403
- Tell him you love him, dear. Please...
- He knows that.

34
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,547
- Say: "I love you son".
- He knows I love him!

35
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,104
Why do you have to roll down the window?
We're gonna be late!

36
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,460
Love you...
that includes your dad.

37
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:28,758
- I want a kiss.
- He's had enough kisses.

38
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:38,541
Cheer up, it's almost Halloween.
In one day and three hours, it's candy time.

39
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:44,987
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool...

40
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:53,123
Speaking of which, have you decided?
Skullser or cryptkeeper?

41
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:59,764
I don't think I'm going
trick-or-treating this year.

42
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,581
Come on!
You're gonna break a six-year streak.

43
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,382
Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.
Maybe I'm getting to grown-up?

44
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:22,331
Three seconds on the clock...
I'm playing basketball.

45
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,171
It's time for an
in-your-face disgrace...

46
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,700
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brain!

47
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,250
Let me see... Oh my God!
You're a dork!

48
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:42,715
Where's my ball?

49
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,818
Oh no...

50
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,916
- Sorry man...
- Wait D.J, you're grown-up now-

51
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,650
-you go get it.
- Your ball just landed on Nebbercrackers lawn.

52
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
It doesn't exist anymore.

53
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:27,323
I payed 28 dollars for that ball.
I reaped 10 yards and asked
my mom for a dollar 26 times.

54
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,900
I've never worked that hard
in my life.

55
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,961
- Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.
- So?

56
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,500
So maybe he's sleeping.

57
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:42,836
- Alright, I'll do it.
- I'll never forget this.

58
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,450
Hurry though!

59
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,857
- You!
- No...

60
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:13,234
What have you done?

61
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,900
- I'm so sorry... I didn't mean...
- You are doomed!

62
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,350
- Come on D.J!
- Help, Chowder!

63
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,624
You think you can just terrorise my lawn?
You wanna be a dead person?

64
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:40,325
This place is not a playground for children!
This is my house!

65
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:45,871
Why can't you respect that?
Why can't you just stay away from...

66
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:36,317
No siren...
Never a good sign.

67
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:49,400
- I'm a murderer.
- No you're not.

68
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:54,958
- When it's an accident, they call it manslaugter.
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

69
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:01,529
- Babysitter's here.
- See you, D.J!

70
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:13,497
D.J, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?

71
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:17,695
Hello?

72
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:25,600
- Elisabeth, can I talk to you about something?
- Oh yeah, of course you can, cantalope.

73
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,850
We are gonna have the bestes time.
I've got tons of neat activities planned.

74
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,400
- They already left.
- Oh, they did? They're gone?

75
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,950
- Yes, and I need to talk to you.
- Ok, so the usual deal. Indoors by nine-

76
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
-In your room by eleven, lights out your call.
- Elisabeth!

77
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,279
And, it's Zee. Now listen up,
I controll the TV, the stereo and the phone.

78
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,427
I don't do boardgames, shrinkydinks
or tuck-ins.

79
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:52,139
- I'm not your mother, I'm not your friend.
- Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?

80
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,071
I am practically a grown-up.
I don't even need you here... Elisabeth.

81
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,576
- Gosh, D.J. Why did you break that?
- But I didn't.

82
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,650
Let me ask you something,
who are they gonna believe?
Go to your room!

83
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:03,287
Hello?

84
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:14,130
Hello? Very funny.
Let's see have you like it.

85
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,807
Happy Halloween, doofus!

86
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:57,154
- Nice one, Bones.
- Look at his face, that's funny?

87
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,500
You're not supposed to have friends over.
Who's this?

88
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:07,839
This is Bones, he's in a band.
Anyway, cantalope...
let's not open up the rulebook, okay?

89
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,900
- since you're up,
way past your bedtime.

90
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,227
No, no, no... This is different.
Listen!

91
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,563
Wow, you called the neighbours.
Good for you.

92
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,800
- I used dial 69, he called me.
- Who called you?

93
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,251
- Nebbercracker!
PS! He died today!
- You lie.

94
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,719
Do not, and now I'm getting
phonecalls from his house.

95
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:40,342
A phonecall,
from beyond the grave...

96
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:48,928
- I'm serious!
- Oh, he's serious...
Did you know he was serious?

97
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,900
- Give her back!
- Oh, her? You mind?

98
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,150
- Oh, come on, growse!
- Come on, Bones.

99
00:16:56,214 --> 00:17:01,080
I think she's having trouble breathing.
She might have something in her throath.

100
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,773
- I'll look into it.
- Bones, knock it off! Downstairs, now!

101
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:11,306
Sorry kid, can't play anymore.

102
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,598
<i>- You're so funny.
- I know, it's like I don't even try.</i>

103
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,719
I got to stop doing this.

104
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:52,822
- Homicide!
- Chowder, where are your parents?

105
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,700
<i>My dad's at the pharmacy, and my mom is
at the movies with her personal trainer.</i>

106
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,250
- Meet me at the dangerzone, now!
- Fine.

107
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:05,642
<i>- I said, knock it off!
- Come on, man.</i>

108
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:11,821
<i>I'm creeped out.
I saw an ambulance here today.</i>

109
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
<i>So?</i>

110
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:20,373
- Maybe Nebbercracker really did die.
- We should be so lucky, the guy is evil.

111
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,617
- No, he's just a grudgy old dude.
- Oh, really? Zee...

112
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:34,500
When I was ten years old, I had a kite.
Awesome kite! I could fly it so high
you couldn't see it.

113
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,733
One day, it crashed down.
I followed the string, and it ended-

114
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,215
-right over there, across the street,
right at the edge of his lawn.

115
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:58,198
- Did he take your kite?
- He takes whatever lands on his lawn.

116
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,356
But that's not the point.
I saw him talking to his house-

117
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,518
-and kissing it.

118
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:15,031
- Besides, everybody knows what he did to his wife...
- What did he do to her?

119
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,633
He ate her!

120
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,207
<i>Stop it! Enough...!</i>

121
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:28,839
<i>Bones, I'm so sick of you!
You have no respect for women.</i>

122
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,950
<i>- What does that mean?
- Get out!</i>

123
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Prune..

124
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,939
What are you lookin' at?

125
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,129
You really are dead, aren't you?

126
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker!
What are you gonna do about it?

127
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:45,594
My awesome kite?

128
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:45,992
Chowder!

129
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,780
Chowder?

130
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,614
- Chowder, what are you doing?

131
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,846
- Shut up!
- What?

132
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,200
- Nebbercracker's back from the dead.
- No way?

133
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:23,816
They leave the keys in here.
Dear me?

134
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,700
Chowder, you're not listening to me.
Nebbercracker's haunting me.

135
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,450
His blood is on my hands.
Now he's coming back for revenge.

136
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:35,800
You're really crazy right now,
have you noticed that?

137
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,450
I think you're just freaking out,
because you killed a guy today.

138
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:43,650
Life goes on...
for you.

139
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,190
Try to relax.
Be cool, like me.

140
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,380
Quit playing around!

141
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,869
- I need your help.
- Fine.

142
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,094
You want my help?
I got three words for you.

143
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,236
Trick - Or - Treat

144
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:12,713
Ok... whatever.
Let's go.

145
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,800
Hold on.

146
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,500
Chowder, come on.

147
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,100
The haunting is subtle.
Yet really really boring.
Can I go home now?

148
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,850
- Chowder, shh, he'll hear us!
- D.J...

149
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,158
This is why nobody will
sit next to us at lunch.

150
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,300
I'll go ding-dong-ditch the house,
and you'll see... No ghost!

151
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,568
Chowder, stop! Please...
I'm serious!

152
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Come back.

153
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:13,246
- Oh no, a bottle!
- Put that down! Come back...
Please!

154
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:36,894
Hey D.J, who am I?
"Get off my lawn!"

155
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,636
Don't... Come on!

156
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,200
<i>Run!</i>

157
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,505
This way, this way, this way!

158
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
<i>Don't look back!</i>

159
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:52,694
Bones?
Coming!

160
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,300
Don't even think about crawling back here...

161
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,384
Boo! Trick-or-treat?

162
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,295
Good morning, mam. You just witnessed
a simulation of what you'll face this evening.

163
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,100
Studies show that households that run
out of candy are 55 % more likely to be "TP'ed".

164
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
To avert this tradegy...

165
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,450
I'm here selling Halloween-candy
for my school, Westbrook Prep.

166
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,728
Good school, I got kicked out of there.
Now, what do you want?

167
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Just trying to get a head start on life,
and secure a successfull future.

168
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,650
You want a successfull future?

169
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,800
When a guy with tattoos comes up to
the drive-thru... give him his burger

170
00:26:41,825 --> 00:26:43,925
-not your phonenumber.

171
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,593
Thank you for the advice,
I'll be sure to make a note of it.
But back to business...

172
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:56,600
Eggs, shaving cream, toiletpaper!
Without candy I'm afraid your house is...
a bullseye with shingles!

173
00:26:56,625 --> 00:27:01,625
- Nice try.. But it's not my house
- Babysitter?

174
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Okay, let's cut the crap.
Maybe the parents you work for
left you 40 dollars in emergency money.

175
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,769
Maybe they left me 30.

176
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,059
Maybe you give me 20,
I write a receipt for 30,
and you pocket 10?

177
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Maybe, and... I want two extra
bags of peanut clusters.

178
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,842
One bag, and...
I'll toss in a licorice whip.

179
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:27,103
You're good...

180
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:41,266
- 8 am... no detectable movement.
- No detectable movement.

181
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,800
Hey D.J,
I brought you some chocolate...

182
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Cover blown?

183
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,375
- No detectable movement.
- What are you two weirdos up to?

184
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,900
Oh, nothing... just something in the
house across the street just tried to eat us!

185
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,250
We've been up all night watching it...
We haven't even left this room once.
Not even to go to the bathroom!

186
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,125
- Don't drink that.
- Growse...

187
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,100
Whatever decease you guys have,
I'm sure it's got letters,
and that they make pills for it.

188
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:23,225
Zee, it's true!
There's something evil going on
across the street!

189
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:30,650
That's great, I'm really happy for you.
Anyway, have you two...
astronomers... seen Bones?

190
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,000
He left last night unexpectedly,
and... he never came back.

191
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,609
He never came back?

192
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,911
- The bottle!
- Of course!

193
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,312
- Okay, I don't have time for this.
- Listen, Zee...

194
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:51,500
- I don't know have to tell you this...
- Your boyfriend has most likely been eaten alive!

195
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:55,850
Sherry Clawson...
I got to go!

196
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,000
Breakfast...
Happy Halloween, losers!

197
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:27,163
- Hello...
- What? What is it?

198
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
- Oh... Nothing.
- Let me see?

199
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,838
Oh, No!

200
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,030
- D.J, that's your phone!

201
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:59,292
Girl...
Stop it!

202
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:05,465
- Don't go any further!
- Come here! Yes, over here...

203
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:12,885
Are you guys mentally challenged?
If you are... I'm certified
to teach you baseball.

204
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,677
<i>Detectable movement!</i>

205
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,556
- What do we do?
- What do we do?
- Come on!

206
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,450
- Run, Chowder!
- I'm running!

207
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,239
Help me!

208
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,061
Hello!

209
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,585
There's an angry dad on the phone,
looking for the one called Chowder!

210
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:02,072
<i>Hello... Losers!
I'm talking to you.</i>

211
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,000
- He's worried about you.
- He should be!

212
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,570
- Start explaining!
- The house is trying to eat us...

213
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,612
- Stop explaining, I've had enough.
- Where are you going?

214
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:20,375
- I'm going to see what's happening
with that stupid house of yours.
- No, no, no! Wait!

215
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,685
- What is your problem?
- Puberty... Lots, and lots of puberty.

216
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
- No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.

217
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,700
- I'm going to find Bones.
- You have fun, okay..
- Don't worry about us, we'll be fine-

218
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,850
-And you tell him I say hey, okay?
Safe driving!

219
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,400
See ya!

220
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,200
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- Oh yeah, I made that whole puberty thing up.

221
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,726
Hey, I'm J.D... D.J.

222
00:31:55,725 --> 00:32:01,973
<i>Yes dad, I meant to call you but I forgot.
Okay, I'm sorry!</i>

223
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Absolutely, affirmative.
Okay, love you. Buy!

224
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:16,184
This is our little observation post.
Such as it where...

225
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,500
Yeah, the posters are stupid.
I was gonna tear it down. Put up some art.

226
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,550
Well, dad... Why don't you kiss my hairy butt!
- Hey D.J, got any beer?

227
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:29,495
- Well... hello there.
- This is Chowder.

228
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,500
- Charles to the ladies.
- Jenny Vennet.

229
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,425
- Two term class president at Westbrook Prep.
- That's a tough school to come into.

230
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,550
- Yeah, I got in.
- But decided not to go.
- It's a girl school.

231
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:46,113
Which is why... I didn't.

232
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,400
- There's a great tacostand near here.
- I hate mexican food.

233
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,582
- Me too.
- Me too.

234
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,802
Fascinating, isn't it?

235
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:08,850
It just sits there waiting.
Mocking us with its... houseness.

236
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:12,192
- May I please use your phone?
- Yeah sure, who are you calling?

237
00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:15,363
- My mother.
- She's probably not going to believe you.

238
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,550
It's too much for the
adult's mind to comprehend.

239
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:23,430
Is this pee?
Because if it is, that's really growse!

240
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:30,500
- D.J, you pee at bottles?
- What are you talking about,
that one's your pee.

241
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,979
May I please speak with Elsa?
Her daughter.

242
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,700
Mom, I was selling chocolates in Mayville...

243
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:48,200
- So... you hate mexican food?
- Yeah, you too?

244
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:53,540
Yeah, in fact...
you might say I started hating it first.
Outside, in front of the house?

245
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,590
Fine, let's get technical, okay?
I started hating it through the telescope.

246
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,102
You can't call dibs on a
girl through a telescope.

247
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,650
- You can't call dibs on a girl.
- Just did.

248
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,200
- Me too.
- She didn't believe me.

249
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,750
Authority can be so...

250
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,514
Ok, normally I don't spend
time with guys like you...

251
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:24,550
but a house just tried to eat me,
so... you got one hour.

252
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:30,786
<i>Oh, puppy...</i>

253
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:43,502
- Didn't see that coming.
- Okay, I think it's time to call the police.

254
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:57,900
- Do you realise what's going to happen tonight?
- Hundreds of kids, walking right up to that house.

255
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Wait, wait, wait! I think we're overreacting.
Only a total moron would walk up to
old man Nebbercrackers house.

256
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,345
- Hey, my ball!
- Chowder, no!

257
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,800
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

258
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,320
Good news, the cops are here.

259
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:30,126
Alright kids, this better be good.
I was in the forrest fighting a bear -

260
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,700
-when we got the call.

261
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,187
I was eating a doughnut!

262
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,595
<i>Alright you three! Step towards the car...
Now!</i>

263
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,500
Alright, they're at the car.
He's a rookie, first week on the job.

264
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,500
Officer, we have reason to believe that
there is a dangerous creature inside that house.

265
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,950
- It may have killed a man.
- And a dog!

266
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:56,817
- Doggy down! We've got a situation!
- What are you doing!

267
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:01,446
Calling for backup!
Didn't you hear what the kids said?

268
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,433
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.

269
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,059
And this is no situation,
it's just a couple of tater tops
hot up on to many pixiesticks.

270
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,090
- I bet you that dead dog would beg to differ.
- What was that!?

271
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,500
Nothing.

272
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:20,115
Time's up, peewees!
It's Halloween, and believe it or not -
we got things to do.

273
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Wait, you can't...
this thing, it has a mouth
and it comes out and grabs things-

274
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,809
-and pulls them in and eats them.
- Yeah, like this...

275
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The thing is, we're trying to make
this sound more real than it normally would.

276
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,100
The problem is it sounds kinda... not real.
So we'll see you later!

277
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,100
Alright, I'll show you!

278
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,834
- But if things get out of hand...
- We'll aim for Bigfoot!

279
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,379
Quit it!

280
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,188
Smart house...

281
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:15,724
Hey! You... both of you!
Come here, bring it to the car! Come on!

282
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,137
I'll forget about you throwing that rock,
because that dance was pretty funny.

283
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
- but the next time any of you mess
with this guys house, all three of you
are going to the hole. - You got it?

284
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:29,506
- Now, I give you ten seconds to march!
- But we need your help!
It's your job to help us!

285
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:32,771
One!... Two!... Three!...

286
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,565
<i>Four!... Five!...</i>

287
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:41,443
- Ouch! It's tender!
- My house is right over there!

288
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:47,487
- So much for relying on the government.
- I know, I hate the government.
- Dude, we're screwed!

289
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,780
No we're not!
We'll go to an expert.

290
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:59,650
You are looking at the threetime tri-state,
over 14, "Thou Are Dead" champion.

291
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,500
His name is Reginald Skulinski,
but they call him "Skull".

292
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,000
- Who's they?
- Me and D.J.

293
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,650
He's the smartest guy on earth.

294
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,000
- So let us go talk to him.
- Wait, Jenny!

295
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,200
Skull is in the gamezone right now.
And you don't want to mess with him
when he's in the gamezone.

296
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,159
Fine, so how long is he gonna
be playing?

297
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:26,761
Who knows? He once played for
four days straight-

298
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,900
- on one quarter, a gallon of
chocolate milk and an adult diaper.

299
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,050
The man's a legend.

300
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,320
Well, if he's not coming out of the
gamezone... then we are going in!

301
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,988
<i>You're gonna die.
You're gonna die!</i>

302
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,670
Did you see that?
I just chopped of your head again.
Your heads rolling, and you can't even see it-

303
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,800
- because your eyes are on your head.
- Skull?

304
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:58,000
What?
I'm busy playing a videogame
without even looking at the screen.

305
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:02,004
- What?!
- Old man Nebbercrackers house is possessed.

306
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,050
- I need to know how to destroy it, before...
- Calm down...

307
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,124
You make me wanna throw up in some
tinfoil, and eat it.

308
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:18,658
Possessed house, you say?

309
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,354
In my travels to the video store and
comic book conventions-

310
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,441
- I've seen many strange and
wondrous things.

311
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,212
And I've heard tell of manmade structures
becoming possessed by a human soul-

312
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:38,750
- so that the spirit
becomes merged with wood and brick,
creating a rear form of monster-

313
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:43,598
-known as Domus Mctippilies.

314
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,004
- The house is mr. Nebbercracker?
- Why is it murdering its enemies?

315
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,471
Have fun getting killed.

316
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,367
- So, how do we kill it?
- You've got to strike at the source of life -
the heart.

317
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,830
But houses don't have hearts...

318
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,911
You might be right about that.

319
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:22,204
Sorry children, but I have got some
very, very important business to take care of.

320
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I won't be seeing you later...

321
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:49,015
- So we need to strike at the heart.
- Where are we gonna find
a heart inside a house?

322
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,900
Ever since Nebbercracker died,
there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.

323
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:07,900
The furnace... the furnace is the heart!
If we wanna put out the fire,
we're gonna have to go inside.

324
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,700
Without getting chewed to pieces.

325
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,000
- Dummy!
- Hey, I was just doodling...

326
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,548
No, Chowder this is it!
First we build the dummy...

327
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:21,250
We fill the dummy with
a few gallons of cold medicin.
You can borrow from your dad's pharmacy.

328
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,265
We feed the dummy to the house.
House eats the medicine,
house goes to sleep...

329
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,366
We get in there, put out the fire...
and get out!

330
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,316
- Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts!?

331
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,908
I don't wanna steal drugs from my father,
I don't wanna to go inside a monster,
and I don't wanna to die!

332
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:42,475
- I think it's worth a shot.
- Yes, I agree.
Let's do it!

333
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:16,097
- Hey, but... I wanted that one.
- You gotta be kidding me?

334
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,237
Go!

335
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:20,533
<i>Alright, vacuum-cleaner dummy.
I'm gonna move you into posistion.
Don't be scared...</i>

336
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,735
<i>That's not how I trained you.
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.</i>

337
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,000
Come on!

338
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,243
- Trick-or-treat?
- Plug it in!

339
00:44:36,229 --> 00:44:39,150
So close...

340
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,810
Littering, loitering,
vandalism, vagrancy...

341
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,764
- And treason!
- No, not treason.

342
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:54,199
- Alright kids, out of the trashcans. Let's go!
- Come on, you heard the big guy.

343
00:44:54,250 --> 00:45:01,050
You see the light, walk towards it.
Keep it movin'.
Alright, drop your weapons-

344
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,600
- pass them to me.

345
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,863
- I will shoot you!
- Well, look what we got here?

346
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:19,134
- Stay here, I'm checking this out.
- I am on it!

347
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:38,229
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me!? You disrespecting the badge,
you don't want none of this...

348
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:41,492
<i>I'm telling you... test me, please!</i>

349
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,331
- That's it! That is it...
- You got something to say, porky?

350
00:45:55,332 --> 00:45:58,832
- We're taking 'em in!
- That's what I'm talkin' about...
- Where are we taking 'em?

351
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,500
- To jail! Let's go!
- You hear that?
You guys are going to jail...

352
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,445
- But officer, you gotta believe us!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah two procent...
You got the right to shut up!

353
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,158
- Ok.. the house is a monster!
- And to think i believed you...

354
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,700
Hey, listen! I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.

355
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:20,950
- I mean, kind of cop. He has a gun...
- They're gonna love you downtown, jughead.

356
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:28,723
- We- we are supercops!
- Yeah, that's why I live in a condo.

357
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,643
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, that's my stomach,
I'm starvin'.

358
00:46:35,774 --> 00:46:40,274
No, no..
That sounds like the dangerous creature.
I'm gonna go check it out!

359
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:45,385
Jeez! It's like trying to wrangle a puppy.
- Right, I'll be back.

360
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,024
<i>No, no...
get out of there!</i>

361
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,110
What?

362
00:47:03,107 --> 00:47:06,774
Superbowl...

363
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,187
<i>Get out!
Stop! Stop!</i>

364
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,370
<i>Where you at,
spooky creature?</i>

365
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:29,220
Freeze... tree!

366
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,700
You can't do that!
That's a officer's weapon,
that is illegal...

367
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:41,483
I'm coming buddy!

368
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,507
- I'm gonna get back-up!
- I thought there was no back-up!

369
00:47:45,508 --> 00:47:49,053
I'm gettin' Judy!

370
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:52,249
Judy...!

371
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:08,306
- Oh my God... I think I'm having a stroke...
- Just try to stay calm. Okay!?
We'll be alright if we just stay calm...

372
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:23,735
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

373
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,224
<i>Jenny, I've always loved you!</i>

374
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:37,863
<i>- Chowder!
- Sorry.</i>

375
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,569
<i>I can't look!</i>

376
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:51,265
Guys, run!
Let's go!

377
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:37,659
- We're dead! You killed us! And now we're dead!
- Shh, I don't think that the house
knows that we're in here.

378
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:45,100
- I bet it thinks we're still in the car.
- Listen! It sounds like it's sleeping...

379
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,150
The only way that we are going
to get out of here alive...
Is if we find the heart, and we put out the fire.

380
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:58,200
- Maybe we should examine our other options.
- Sure, other option! We wait here and
do nothing, till it wakes up and eats us!

381
00:49:58,576 --> 00:50:02,618
Find the heart, put out the fire...
Got it!

382
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:17,430
Explosives!
So cool...

383
00:50:33,106 --> 00:50:36,900
- He was watching me...
- D.J!

384
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:42,736
- Did you ever see a wife?
- People used to say he had one-

385
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,800
-but he battered her up,
and he ate her!

386
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,098
Demolition-squad...

387
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,091
- Sorry...
- Come on!

388
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
- Be quiet!
- Don't worry, I have a very light step.

389
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:22,870
There! Right there!
Shoot it!

390
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,900
- What!?
I thought if I shot the heart, then...
- that is not the heart.

391
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,350
- Then, what is it?
- Well, if those are the teeth-

392
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,400
-and that's the tongue...
then that must be the uvula.

393
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,500
- Oh... so it's a girlhouse?
- What?

394
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:22,257
No!
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.

395
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,984
Not me.

396
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:48,834
Ok, let's move!

397
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,414
We're gonna move quickly, and quietly...
Don't touch anything!
Let's stay together...

398
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,800
- D.J!
- Wait...

399
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,797
... I'll save you.

400
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,527
- Chowder, knock it off!
- sorry, I thought you were...

401
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,000
D.J!
- Chowder, it's a toy...

402
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,918
- Where's D.J? D.J!
- Over here!

403
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:42,743
Wow... look at all these toys!

404
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:46,611
This must be where
Nebbercracker kept his stash.

405
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,686
I think you guys should
have a look at this...

406
00:53:56,304 --> 00:54:00,836
<i>Constance - The Giantess</i>

407
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,560
- The key!
- Come on D.J, we don't have time for this.
- Yeah, we got to find a way out of here.

408
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:25,681
What are you doing?

409
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,500
We have a Ping Pong table in
our basement..

410
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:46,400
- Constance.
- Holy moly! He really did eat her.

411
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:52,413
Couldn't have...
Her whole body is buried in cement.

412
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,650
Look at all this stuff...

413
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,433
Why would he build her a shrine,
if he murdered her?

414
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:11,300
- Maybe he just felt guilty or something...
D.J, can we please get out of here?
- Shh..

415
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,600
I always knew you were hiding something,
mr. Nebbercracker.

416
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,788
Let her go, Big Nose!

417
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
It's awake!
Run!

418
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Hey! I know that sound...

419
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:18,834
My ball!
Where are you going?

420
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,900
- Chowder, come back!
- You get back here...

421
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,436
Got ya!

422
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:33,649
Killer Slinky!

423
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:37,805
Leave me alone!

424
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,100
Chowder!

425
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,673
Got you!

426
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,343
D.J, look out!

427
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,228
The uvula!

428
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:15,301
- Growse!
- Did we just get up-chucked?

429
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,400
The uvula...
the emergency exit.

430
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:27,520
- That's it!
Another great idea, D.J! Brilliant!
- What do you want from me, Chowder?

431
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,460
- I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.
- Do you wanna hear my big idea?

432
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,500
I am going home
to make a pretzel sandwich!
See ya!

433
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,600
- Chowder, the house is still alive
and you are going to whuss out?
- I risked my life for you-

434
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,900
- I stole drugs for you,
and I could have died in there!

435
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,017
- Me too!
- Yeah, but you're the one that
killed Nebbercracker in the first place!

436
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:51,200
- Getting your stupid ball back!
- You guys, stop fighting!
You're acting like babies.

437
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:57,700
We are babies! What were we thinking?
We tried to put a house to sleep
with cold medicin...

438
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:01,100
- How lame can you get?
- Where are you going?

439
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,960
I'm going home...
I suck.

440
00:59:06,772 --> 00:59:08,872
D.J!

441
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,500
At least it's an ambulance.

442
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,500
It's a ghost!
Be gone!

443
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,600
Be gone yourself!
Get away!

444
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,313
He's not a ghost! He's not dead...
I'm not a murderer!

445
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,769
Of course I'm not dead!
Who said I was dead?

446
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,314
You'll be dead if you don't scram!

447
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,960
Don't you know what day this is?

448
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,641
I'm running out of time...
I'm running out of time!

449
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,735
Honey... I'm home!

450
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,688
Look at you dear...

451
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:27,250
Shingles are all ruffled,
the windows are cracked...

452
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:36,673
- But it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.
- That's her... The house is her!

453
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,433
- Come on!
- Where are you going?

454
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:47,600
Mister Nebbercracker!
I know about Constance.

455
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,052
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

456
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:59,712
You where in my house?

457
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,130
You didn't kill her, did you?

458
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,600
I love her so much...

459
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,339
Hello?

460
01:01:45,117 --> 01:01:49,765
I can take you away from here.
Would you like that?

461
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:55,655
Yes!

462
01:02:10,223 --> 01:02:16,223
Alright... Okay, open your eyes.
Now it's not much I know, but...

463
01:02:22,746 --> 01:02:28,983
Get away from my house!
I'll rip them to bits!

464
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,027
Constance! What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

465
01:02:35,075 --> 01:02:39,075
Yes, I'm hurt.
They are attacking our house!

466
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,700
They're just kids, dear.
It's Halloween!

467
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,000
No, no, no... it's my house,
and they're hurting me!

468
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:54,743
Constance, look at me! Look at me!
As long as I'm here I will never
let anyone hurt you.

469
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:03,010
- You vandals, you hooligans! I'll get you!
- Constance, no!

470
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:21,054
<i>So... I finished the house.
She would have wanted that.</i>

471
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:26,400
<i>She died... but she didn't leave.</i>

472
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:35,588
<i>That night!
That one night of every year...!</i>

473
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,628
I had to take precautions.
I had to...

474
01:03:41,923 --> 01:03:44,949
I had to!

475
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,625
<i>Stay away from my house!</i>

476
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:58,101
She attacks anyone who comes near.

477
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,718
I'm coming, dear!
- Go!

478
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,500
- No wait!
I know how you've been
protecting us all these years -

479
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,125
- but now it's our turn to protect you...
Let her go!

480
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,900
- But if I let her go... I'll have no-one.
- That's not true.

481
01:04:35,775 --> 01:04:38,367
Not so!

482
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,985
Hide!

483
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:12,369
- What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down!

484
01:05:32,067 --> 01:05:37,767
- Come, mr. Nebbercracker. Come on!
- Run, run! I can't...

485
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:45,833
- Mr. Nebbercracker, hurry!
- Go on! I'll be alright.

486
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:02,729
Come on!

487
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:29,586
You stay away from
those children, Constance!

488
01:06:53,387 --> 01:06:57,983
- Constance...
- Mister Nebbercracker.

489
01:07:07,192 --> 01:07:13,192
My sweet...
You've been a bad girl,
haven't you?

490
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,695
You hurt people.

491
01:07:18,913 --> 01:07:23,913
We've always known this day
would come... haven't we?

492
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,081
I have to make things right.

493
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:37,708
I have to make things right.

494
01:07:43,942 --> 01:07:48,400
I've always done
what's best for you, haven't I?

495
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:52,416
Haven't I, girl?

496
01:07:57,078 --> 01:08:00,078
Constance...

497
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,910
Let this be
the right thing to do...

498
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:16,962
Leave him alone!

499
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:23,322
Take that!
... and that!

500
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,650
- Take this!
- You have to help me, please...

501
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,903
I know you can do it!

502
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,378
Go on!

503
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,807
- How do you know how to
drive this thing?
- I don't!

504
01:08:53,065 --> 01:08:56,565
The chimney!
The chimney leads to the heart...

505
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,129
- Jenny! Are you alright?
- I'm not sure.

506
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:27,450
- D.J! Get rid of that thing!
- I'm working on it.

507
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:31,000
Chowder! I need you to
get the house down under that crane.

508
01:09:31,018 --> 01:09:34,133
- Piece of cake...

509
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,600
You think you can
just mess with my friends!?

510
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,411
Mommy!

511
01:10:15,356 --> 01:10:18,351
<i>Chowder!
Come in, Chowder!</i>

512
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,516
<i>Chowder, buddy?</i>

513
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:35,753
Hey guys! Look who just won!
It's me... the screw-up!

514
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:47,629
- I'm sorry...
- Come on! Yes, look at me...

515
01:10:52,076 --> 01:10:55,849
You can't do that.
It's not fair!

516
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
That's it, Chowder!
Keep her coming...

517
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,600
You ain't nothin'! You're a shack!
You're an outhouse!

518
01:12:23,945 --> 01:12:30,386
- I can't!
- Yes, you can... Go!

519
01:12:30,918 --> 01:12:35,626
I kissed a girl...
I kissed a girl on the lips.

520
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:41,678
Any time now!

521
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,550
Sorry!

522
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:52,714
D.J! Hurry!

523
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,450
I'm flying!

524
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,432
- On the count of three,
I want you to light the dynamite!
- Okay, I got it!

525
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,190
- One...! Two...!
- Yes!

526
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,017
Three!

527
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:25,189
Do you guys hear something?

528
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,202
It's over there...
Come on!

529
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,841
<i>My dear... </i>

530
01:14:45,067 --> 01:14:48,067
Bye...

531
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:13,094
I'm sorry, mr. Nebbercracker,
about your house... and your wife.

532
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,000
Your housewife.

533
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:24,226
45 years...

534
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:32,100
We have been trapped for 45 years,
and now...

535
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,372
... we're free!

536
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:47,578
We're free!
Thank you friend!
Thank you all!

537
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:14,857
Here you go.
Happy Halloween!

538
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,950
Next!

539
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,185
- What happened to Nebbercrackers house?
-  It turned into a monster-

540
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,790
-so I blew it up.

541
01:16:26,841 --> 01:16:31,491
- Trick-or-treat?
- We're gonna need a tricycle!

542
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:37,820
- One tricycle, coming up!
- Tricycle...

543
01:16:39,823 --> 01:16:45,991
Hello tricycle! I missed you so much!
Thank you mister!

544
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:53,279
There's my mom.

545
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:59,980
So... We should hang out again.
Soon...

546
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:14,041
- Good luck with the puberty!
- She grabbed my butt.
- That's nice, Chow...

547
01:17:16,108 --> 01:17:22,800
- Hey mr. Nebbercracker... it's time to go!
- You go on... I got some work to do.

548
01:17:23,912 --> 01:17:27,712
- Alright, thanks!
- I'll see you around.

549
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,057
Hey... stay off my lawn.

550
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,312
Just kidding.

551
01:17:34,347 --> 01:17:38,600
- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
He'll go on vacation -

552
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:43,743
- get some colour,
maybe he'll meet someone new?
This time, maybe a nice beach house?

553
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:48,374
- Hey D.J, look who's here
- Yes, I can see that. Thank you.
- No biggie!

554
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:50,890
- Hey boys!
- Hey dad!

555
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,459
What the heck..?
No don't tell me, let me guess...

556
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,255
- Dirty pirates?
- That's it! Dirty pirates!

557
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,800
You look adorable...
Have fun tonight!

558
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,100
You know... you're right.

559
01:18:28,147 --> 01:18:31,501
We're definetly to
old for trick-or-treating...

560
01:18:31,536 --> 01:18:34,579
Oh yeah, no question about it.

561
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:42,800
On the other hand...
we've been working all night...

562
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,100
- Candy time?
- Candy time...

563
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,650
We're back!
Yes!

564
01:20:30,552 --> 01:20:33,422
Did we just get...?

565
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,707
It's Halloween, right?
What do you say...

566
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:46,038
... you and I go out
and "inspect" some candy?

567
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:54,539
- We should go eat some candy too.
- That's a good idea.

568
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:02,200
- Let's go eat some candy...
Lots of yummy candy!
- Like carrots...

569
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:05,816
Alright, where's the car?

570
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:10,432
And that is how I
slayed that mystical dragon...

571
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:16,080
- Come on baby, we're out of here.
- Not so fast, Bones.

572
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:20,800
Times have changed...
Skull's not like you.

573
01:21:20,946 --> 01:21:25,113
He gives me the respect I deserve...
and makes time for me.

574
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:27,250
Whatever...

575
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:31,016
Bones!
