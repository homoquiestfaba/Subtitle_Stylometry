1
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:44,978
Are we rolling?

2
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:45,813
Yeah.

3
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,080
Okay.

4
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,316
Hello, I'm George
Harris, and this is

5
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,485
my thesis project on fear.

6
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,654
Myself and the camera man,

7
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,655
What's up?

8
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,425
Simon, and three other friends

9
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,592
are gonna be going
into the woods

10
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,961
in complete isolation
to, hopefully,

11
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,897
better understand fear.

12
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,367
Is that good? You got it?

13
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:08,202
Yeah.

14
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,202
Cut it.

15
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,539
Uh, he uh, George wants me to

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,543
do some sorta diary,
so here you go.

17
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,481
We are on our way to pick
up George and Elizabeth.

18
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,716
Uh, we're gonna pack up and go.

19
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,018
The, they wanna
go to Amityville,

20
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,455
you know, get spooky ghosts.

21
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,157
I don't know why we
have to drive so far

22
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:33,025
when we have perfectly
good ghosts here.

23
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,362
And here we are.

24
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:07,928
What are you doing?

25
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,262
Get out of here!

26
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,563
What are you doing?

27
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,598
Oh my God!

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,632
Uh.

29
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,468
Shut the camera off.

30
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,739
Well, here it is.

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,375
Uh, called a bunch of people,

32
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,211
got a bunch of emails,
went back and forth

33
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:27,280
through a lot of people,
but I finally got it.

34
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,718
This is the original
'97 Amityville tape.

35
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,890
Uh, hopefully, it
has, it can shine

36
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,292
a little bit of light on some of

37
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,993
the stuff that I'm
trying to figure out,

38
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,163
but it's here and I have it.

39
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,500
And, we'll see what happens.

40
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,478
Hi, babe. It's me.

41
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,115
So, I decided to bust out your
brother's wedding gift to us.

42
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,051
And here I am using
the camcorder.

43
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:09,155
So, I decided that I'm
gonna make some videos

44
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,824
as I move into
the new house that

45
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:16,195
we just closed on right
before you got deployed.

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,598
So, um, I just wanna make sure

47
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,268
you don't miss anything
while you're overseas.

48
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,937
So, I figured that we could
watch them when you get back,

49
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,373
and, okay I'm gonna
show you the house.

50
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,776
Okay, three, two, one, ta-da.

51
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,480
Look how cute it is.

52
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,481
Woo!

53
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,317
Okay, so this is
the front porch.

54
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,651
Look how big it is.

55
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,754
We can get a new patio
set, and put it here.

56
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,156
And then we can eat
breakfast together

57
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,593
out here in the mornings.

58
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,762
And, um, it needs
some new paint,

59
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,332
but that's okay,
it's gonna be great.

60
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,600
I wish you were here.

61
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,002
Okay, um, all right,
let's go inside, okay.

62
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,504
And we're inside.

63
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,138
Okay, so I haven't
seen it yet either.

64
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,142
Whoa, there's a lot
of stuff in here.

65
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,513
Okay, this is great.

66
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,848
Uh, okay.

67
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,319
So then this is the living
room area through here.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,220
And then this is the other side.

69
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,023
Oh, this is so cute, okay.

70
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,760
And then through
here is the kitchen.

71
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,864
So we have our
fridge, and our table.

72
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,334
Oh wow. Awe.

73
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,937
You can see right
outside to the backyard.

74
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,239
Oh, that's beautiful.

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,743
And then this is our sun room.

76
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,550
Oh, I wish you were here.

77
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,454
Okay, so now we're
going upstairs.

78
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:48,822
And we're, huh.

79
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,295
There are a I, oh gro,
oh god, ew, uh.

80
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,968
Oh great, okay
well, that's gross.

81
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,504
Okay, um, oh god.

82
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,873
Oh, and they're crunchy
when we step on 'em.

83
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,509
Oh okay, uh, okay, uh well,

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,180
this is one of the rooms
with two tiny beds,

85
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,085
but we'll bring in a
nice big bed, won't we?

86
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,187
Get it?

87
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,123
All right, so,
going through here.

88
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,993
Hello.

89
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,994
And...

90
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,732
What's this?

91
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,413
Oh, well, oh.

92
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,419
Oh, it's really
humid in here, uch.

93
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Mm...

94
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,127
Ooh.

95
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,196
Ah, that's so squeaky, okay.

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,899
Yep, that's enough, okay.

97
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,071
Um, I'm gonna go into the
really creepy basement now.

98
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,007
Okay, let's, oh god.

99
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:20,747
Oh, oh god.

100
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,555
Okay, well, like, this could
be nice if it was finished.

101
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,795
Put some storage in
here, could be cool.

102
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,666
Um...

103
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,705
Hm, there's a lot of
broken glass back there.

104
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,441
Okay, well, that's good to know.

105
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:49,442
And water.

106
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,314
Oh great. Oh shit!

107
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,490
Yep, okay.

108
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,294
Yeah, so the basement is a no.

109
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:12,665
Um, you can go down
there when you get back.

110
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,900
Nice big strong man.

111
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,901
Uh...

112
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,271
'Cause I, wow, scared
myself half to death, okay.

113
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:24,010
Um, yeah, but that's basically
the tour of the house.

114
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,512
Oh, you'll love it,
okay, so there's

115
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,680
a firing range actually
just down the street.

116
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,050
So, you can keep up
with your gun play.

117
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,051
Um...

118
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,656
So yeah, all right, well
that's my first video.

119
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,827
So, I love you, a
lot, and I miss you.

120
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,599
Ooh, that's cold.

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Oh, come on, see,

122
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,401
why don't you join the party?

123
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,972
Take your top off, pop the top.

124
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,208
Uh, hey.

125
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,546
So, y-you get upset when I
film you earlier but not,

126
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,047
now it's okay?

127
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,184
You know, it's a little
thing called consent.

128
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,185
Woo.

129
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,453
Isn't this kinda weird

130
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,291
that's your brother
over there, or...

131
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,127
Not, I mean, it's kinda
like when we were kids

132
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,131
in the bathtub,
except more tattoos.

133
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,767
You're shuttin'
off that camera now.

134
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,103
Hey, shut that camera off, and
you're deleting it right now.

135
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,104
Now!

136
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,507
We're on our way to pick
up Simon's friend Lisa now.

137
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,343
I've never met her,
and I'm very excited

138
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,845
that she's gonna
come aboard because

139
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,883
she's gonna give us a fresh
perspective on the situation.

140
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,719
Sarah?

141
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,719
Yeah.

142
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,122
What are you afraid of?

143
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:20,193
Oh god, um, obscurity.

144
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,130
Really?

145
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,397
Yeah.

146
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,333
I'm fairly confident
that's not what it is.

147
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:31,070
Well no, I mean, like,
it's not even so much that,

148
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,474
it's just that I'm
afraid of being alone.

149
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,711
Does that make sense?

150
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,246
Like, - Kinda.

151
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,115
If no one else knows who
you are you never existed.

152
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,717
If no one, if nobody knows you,

153
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,655
if you don't, if
you're alone, you,

154
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,389
did you even exist,
where you even there?

155
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,561
It's like if a tree falls
in the forest, you know?

156
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,474
Ladies and gentlemen,

157
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,912
I give you Mother Earth
herself, Lisa Sheets.

158
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,854
Come on, come on. Here it is.

159
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,656
There you go. Come on.

160
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,657
Lisa?

161
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,859
Yeah?

162
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,061
So, what's with the chickens?

163
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,863
Is it, do you have
them for the eggs,

164
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,865
the meat, what's the deal?

165
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,869
No, I just, I-I
wouldn't eat them.

166
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,805
I think that they're cute.

167
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,173
Uh, I like having
animals around.

168
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,542
They make me feel at peace.

169
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,479
I like submerging
myself in nature,

170
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,785
and taking care of animals
really makes me happy.

171
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,321
Seems like a lot of
work for no eggs or meat.

172
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,322
You know?

173
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,859
Yeah, I guess, like, people
have cats and dogs, you know.

174
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah, yeah, they're like pets.

175
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,796
I love chicken.

176
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,231
Sandwiches.

177
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,166
Fried chicken.

178
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,599
Yeah.

179
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,035
Gross.

180
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,739
You might think that the
chicken thing is weird,

181
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,907
but I think it's
weirder that you wanna

182
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,144
go out into the woods
to experience fear

183
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,180
when the woods are so peaceful.

184
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:26,085
It's a little bit different
in Amityville, I think.

185
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,687
Like, Amityville, Amityville?

186
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,489
Yeah.

187
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,459
Is there a problem with that?

188
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,660
I thought you said there's

189
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,097
nothing to be afraid
of in the woods.

190
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,499
Why do we have to go there?

191
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,171
Because this
is a thesis on fear.

192
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:50,911
So, uh, what are you
afraid of, big brother?

193
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,113
I think, um, we're gonna wait

194
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,616
'til we get on location
to discuss that.

195
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,988
He's afraid of
letting our father down.

196
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,161
Hi, babe. It's me.

197
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,864
So, I'm gonna start
my aerobics workout.

198
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:16,035
And this is so you
know that all of this

199
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,205
is gonna be ready for
you when you get back.

200
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,141
So just, don't laugh to much

201
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,709
when you watch this, okay?

202
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,881
Just, all right, okay,
here we go.

203
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:31,218
Hm.

204
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,391
Hm hm hm hm.

205
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,599
Hm hm hm heh.

206
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,909
Hi. Uh, can I help you?

207
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,846
Oh, um, I have a delivery.

208
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,180
Oh, my groceries, great.

209
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,681
Come on in, come on in.

210
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,283
I never thought
I'd be delivering

211
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,085
groceries to this house.

212
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,686
Wait, what?

213
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,255
Uh, I don't wanna go...

214
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,456
Oh, that's okay, you want to

215
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,991
have a glass of
water or something?

216
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,526
Yeah, come on in, come on
in, make yourself at home.

217
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,298
I mean, I haven't really
yet, but come on in.

218
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,740
All right, um, hi babe. It's me.

219
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,978
Um, so, funny story.

220
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,015
So, I had our
groceries delivered,

221
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,718
which is crazy, right,
and kind of adorable.

222
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,388
Um, but the guy
who delivered them

223
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:46,558
started telling me about,
um, that

224
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,130
our house is the haunted
house of the town.

225
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,533
That apparently everybody
knows about except, um, us.

226
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,103
So that was great to find out.

227
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,772
Um, so, it's been kind of weird.

228
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,943
But I talked to Doctor
Stevens, actually,

229
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,880
and she told me that I should
keep talking to the camera.

230
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,782
Which I was gonna do
anyways to keep you updated,

231
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,352
but she thought that
if I kept talking to it

232
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,056
that I wouldn't feel so
lonely, or so anxious.

233
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:20,659
So, now I just feel really
weird and embarrassed,

234
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,996
and this is really awkward,
but it's gonna be fine.

235
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,998
And if I hate it then
I'll just throw the tapes

236
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,468
down the garbage disposal
and you'll never find out.

237
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,670
Um, so, it's great.

238
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,841
Um, but the house
needs a lot of work.

239
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,545
Um, we need new
wall paper upstairs.

240
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,713
And the floors are gross.

241
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
Actually, all the
floors are gross.

242
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,485
And, oh, and the toilet
doesn't flush either.

243
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,088
So I had to go outside,
and get a bucket,

244
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,125
and then bring it in, and then
fill the toilet with water,

245
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,695
and then I, I'm just way too...

246
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,932
Tired to be doing all
this, but it's fine.

247
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,401
And,

248
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,635
So, it'll be great.

249
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,638
Um, but you know,
that's probably why

250
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,908
we got the house for so
cheap, because it's haunted.

251
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,678
'Cause there are just
so many ghosts in here.

252
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,381
And maybe the ghosts will
help me fix the toilet.

253
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,648
'Cause you're not here to do it.

254
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,649
Um...

255
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,120
But I miss you, and
it's gonna be great,

256
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,655
and I think you're really gonna
love it when you get back.

257
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,726
And I promise I'll make it
really pretty, and not too girly.

258
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,195
Um...

259
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,298
Yeah. And oh, and the
idea of there being ghosts

260
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,266
in this house is not
an April fools joke,

261
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,203
so don't try to pull that,
cause I know you will.

262
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,204
Um...

263
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,141
Yeah, so that's it.

264
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,012
Hey.

265
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,749
Hi sweetheart, it's me.

266
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,320
Um, just getting ready for bed.

267
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,990
I miss you, and I
hope you're safe.

268
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:01,127
Um, and I wish you were here.

269
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,295
Okay, well not, not
here in this bed

270
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,933
because this bed is small,
and old, and creepy,

271
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,503
but in a nice big bed that
I actually ordered today.

272
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,640
So, hopefully,
it'll be here soon.

273
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,975
But, yeah, um...

274
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,247
Come home soon, I love you.

275
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,915
Excuse me, sir?

276
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,384
Yeah.

277
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,585
Do you have a
moment to talk for a second?

278
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,786
Sir, how does it
feel, like, to live

279
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,654
in the most haunted
city in America?

280
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,623
I enjoy living
here, but you know,

281
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,525
all this ghost
stuff, it's all hype.

282
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,260
So you don't
believe in the ghosts that...

283
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,230
No, no, I mean,
most of the time

284
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,632
it's just, it's just stories

285
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,167
made up for tourists like you

286
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,469
to come around and spend money.

287
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,405
Do you, personally,

288
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:19,671
believe in the paranormal?

289
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:23,442
No, no, I can't say I do.

290
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,078
But I would probably
avoid the house.

291
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,013
You know, those people,

292
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,216
they don't like people
steppin' on their lawn,

293
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,718
a-a-and you know, people
have harassed the enough.

294
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,621
If I was you I'd just, I'd
just avoid it at all costs.

295
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,623
I-it makes sense,
I'm just tryin' to

296
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,826
get to the center
of why people say

297
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,628
that this places is
haunted if the people

298
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,663
that live here don't believe it.

299
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,365
Because of the
books, the movies,

300
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,567
I mean, it,
it's all just made up.

301
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,169
Do you think
the house is haunted?

302
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,705
Oh, I mean, I've been
there a couple times,

303
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,041
and it's pretty freaky,
but mm, I don't know.

304
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,276
I don't know if it's haunted.

305
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,444
Do you know where it's at?

306
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,379
'Cause we really wanted
to go down there,

307
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,446
maybe get a couple shots of it.

308
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,281
You wanna go down there.

309
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:02,514
Yeah.

310
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,651
Okay, well I could get
you the, the address.

311
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:09,255
I have it, I know the address,
but it's gonna cost ya.

312
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,456
Really?

313
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,124
No, no, just messin' with ya.

314
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,591
Yeah.

315
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,393
All right, let me write
it down for ya, here.

316
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:14,593
Cool.

317
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,594
Okay.

318
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,666
Yeah.

319
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,140
Uh, where's your pack?

320
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,575
Maybe you could lend a hand.

321
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,177
Hey, I got the camera goin'.

322
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,979
Uh, you keep doin' what
you guys are doin'.

323
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,747
Guys, we got about 40
more minutes of daylight,

324
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,651
and about 100 yards
away, let's go.

325
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,759
Got our camp all set up, now
we just need a roarin' fire.

326
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,431
He wouldn't let us
bring any marshmallows.

327
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,066
Okay.

328
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,371
Here we go.

329
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,072
It's me again.

330
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,308
Here I am.

331
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,309
Um...

332
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,512
It's just been such a journey.

333
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,849
Um, I, oh, I went to the
hardware store this morning.

334
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,551
Which, I, gonna be
honest with you,

335
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,785
didn't know what I was doing,

336
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,721
had no idea what I was doing.

337
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,390
Um, but I found some new stuff,

338
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,593
to, like, take down the gross
wallpaper that's upstairs.

339
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,730
And so, hopefully, I'm
gonna use these muscles,

340
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,698
do it all by myself.

341
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,368
And, um, I miss you.

342
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,003
So, that's nothing new.

343
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,005
It gets really cold at night.

344
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,676
And I miss you cuddling with me,

345
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,646
um, to keep me warm.

346
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,782
But, things around the house
are going better, I guess.

347
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,484
I put in a lot of orders
for different stuff,

348
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,952
to, like, come in.

349
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,621
Um, I started going
through all of this stuff

350
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,623
that the previous owners left.

351
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,092
I guess they didn't
wanna take it with them

352
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,895
and didn't wanna
live with ghosts.

353
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,096
So, I started going through it.

354
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,165
So that's a new project,
because you know,

355
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,534
I have nothing better
to do with my time,

356
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,802
than add another project.

357
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,538
Um, but found
some pretty cool shit.

358
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,207
So, like, some of it might stay.

359
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,342
Um, we'll see.

360
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,611
And then I brought in our stuff.

361
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,781
And that's getting
kind of organized.

362
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,783
I don't really know where
you want everything,

363
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,251
so I'm just gonna put it there,

364
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,686
and then if you don't
like it when you get back,

365
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,421
then you can just change it.

366
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,825
Um, but yeah, and it's
been nice outside.

367
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,394
Like, the weather's
really beautiful.

368
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,095
There's a couple
patches of, like,

369
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,130
these purple flowers
around the corner

370
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,566
by the shed that are
really beautiful.

371
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,735
So, hopefully, they
probably won't be here

372
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,604
when you get back,
but that's okay.

373
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,572
I'll take pictures of them.

374
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,642
All right, so we're
goin' on a field trip.

375
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,011
And I'm gonna take you outside.

376
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:49,281
Yeah, look how great
the paint looks, babe.

377
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,952
This is gonna be so fun
to do all by myself.

378
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,422
Phew, and it's hot outside.

379
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,256
Hey, did you hear
all those guns?

380
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,558
Remind me of you.

381
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,259
Goin' around the corner.

382
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,994
Look how cute these are.

383
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,262
Okay, well those are dandelions,

384
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,332
but I'm just gonna
leave 'em, awe.

385
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,335
Goin' around the corner.

386
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,969
Okay, look how pretty these are.

387
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,704
Now, I don't know, oh
god, that was a bee.

388
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:13,540
Okay, no, we're fine.

389
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,206
It's fine.

390
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,475
Awe, look how pretty these are.

391
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,310
I don't really know
anything about flowers.

392
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,179
I could not tell you
what these are named.

393
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,350
But they're really pretty.

394
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,920
I miss you, and I love
you to the moon and back.

395
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,090
And, come home soon, okay?

396
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,931
All right, you guys, pizza.

397
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,100
Everybody take a slice, please.

398
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,035
I know you guys are hungry.

399
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,037
Uh, vegan.

400
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,339
Oh, okay.

401
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,307
Thanks, though.

402
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,941
W-what are you doing?

403
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:50,877
What...

404
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:51,944
I'm eating.

405
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,580
Lizzie.

406
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,214
She wants pizza.

407
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,416
Good.

408
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,984
So, you're eating grass.

409
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,619
It's not got a lot of...
No, it's clover, it's good.

410
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,020
It's kinda sweet, you want some?

411
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:02,855
No.

412
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:03,690
Yeah.

413
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,624
Mm.

414
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,091
No seriously, it's nice.

415
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,960
Like, if you bite, like,
right here it's kinda sweet.

416
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,662
That sounds terrible.

417
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,863
You're really eating grass?

418
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,064
No, it's clover.

419
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,265
Oh, okay.

420
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,201
- Why, why won't...
- Duh.

421
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:16,702
Why won't you eat the pizza?

422
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,470
I'm vegan.

423
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,507
So, about this video,
what is it exactly?

424
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,841
That is really bright.

425
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,478
We're doing a
documentary on fear,

426
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,647
uh, what people are afraid of,

427
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,749
why people are afraid
of these things,

428
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,053
what made these people afraid
of these things to begin with.

429
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,321
What are you afraid of?

430
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,658
I'm most afraid of people.

431
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,731
We, as a species, are capable
of such beauty and loving,

432
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,268
and yet we hurt each other.

433
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,103
What? Hey.

434
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,339
No, no, no,

435
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,307
- keep going.
- What we're doing

436
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,975
as a species to this planet

437
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:00,979
and our blindness to
that is terrifying.

438
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,483
So that's why you eat grass.

439
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,319
I think she's afraid that people

440
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,656
will find out that she
doesn't know anything.

441
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,923
That's what I think.

442
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,428
So, what makes you so
right about everything?

443
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,029
It's just daddy issues.

444
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,600
I wouldn't take
it too personally.

445
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,868
I don't know if anybody
remembers what I said,

446
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,003
but you guys check your phones?

447
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,405
- Uh...
- I, mine's dead.

448
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,540
I got no bars.

449
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,709
- Yeah.
- Mm, right.

450
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,480
- No bars.
- So service, exactly.

451
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,447
Isolation.

452
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,719
It lets us enjoy the
spirit of the nature,

453
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,590
like, really immerse
yourselves in it.

454
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,659
I don't know, I'm
just gonna miss Tumbler.

455
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,664
Check that out,
look at those skills.

456
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,168
What was that?

457
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,303
It's just a dog.

458
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,538
That is not a dog.

459
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,906
It sounds like a wolf.

460
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,108
It couldn't have been either.

461
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,845
I was a boy scout, I kind
of know these things.

462
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,914
- Give me the camera.
- Don't go, don't go.

463
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,316
- No.
- Let me see it. I'm goin'.

464
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,684
Simon, just

465
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:13,486
give him the camera.
Come on, give me the camera.

466
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:14,720
You're not goin'.

467
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,987
Of course, I'm not going.

468
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:16,823
Just let him go.

469
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:18,289
No.

470
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,591
Hang out with
the weird chick, I'm goin'.

471
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:20,426
Hey.

472
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,193
What?

473
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,995
I'm going with you.

474
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,731
Why, why does she get to go?

475
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,366
So, I'm sorry about
that comment earlier,

476
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,001
the daddy issues comment.

477
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,304
I just, I didn't like how
you were talking to her.

478
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,106
You were kind of cutting
into her a little bit,

479
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,307
and she's a nice girl.
II know,

480
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,644
it's all right, like,
you know I'm gonna

481
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,145
talk about dad at
some point, anyway.

482
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,847
So, I understand, it's fine.

483
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,081
All right.

484
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,517
What are you doin' out here!

485
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,519
Uh, we're camp,

486
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,454
we're camping, there...

487
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:49,888
Camping?

488
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,523
What's with the camera?

489
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,391
We're doin'
a project for school.

490
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,994
What's with the gun?

491
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,763
There's dangerous
animals out here.

492
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,497
What are you doin'
out here at dark?

493
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,966
Yeah, we just heard an animal,

494
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,233
and that's why we were comin'
out here to check it out.

495
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,434
You're damn right,
you heard an animal!

496
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,903
So you come lookin' for it

497
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:07,405
in the dark with
nothin' but a camera?

498
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,340
Yeah.

499
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,708
Are you outta your mind?

500
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:13,044
No. I mean, no, we were just,

501
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,614
we just wanted to know
what that noise was.

502
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,083
Look, son, there's
dangerous animals

503
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,486
out here all over this place.

504
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,892
My girl went missin' about
a month ago, my daughter.

505
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,226
And I been lookin' for her.

506
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,928
You got parents you care about?

507
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,196
- Yeah.
- Of course.

508
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,463
Well, unless you
want them goin'

509
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,899
through the same thing I am,

510
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,301
you will get your ass
back to that campsite

511
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,136
and stay there until it's light.

512
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,370
- All right.
- Well, this,

513
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,739
this is a public place, I mean,

514
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,440
we're not breaking any
rules, we're just...

515
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,909
You're right, you're right,

516
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,277
you're not breakin' any rules.

517
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,246
But you want your
parents to get some kinda

518
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,115
nice little letter about
what happened to you

519
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,349
when you get hurt out here?
Liz, come on.

520
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,184
- All right.
- All right, okay.

521
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:53,619
All right, we're going.

522
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,187
So, with George
out of the picture,

523
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,956
what actually scares you?

524
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,991
Where you all serious about
what you were sayin' earlier,

525
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,829
or, explain it a
little bit better.

526
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:08,934
Yeah, I mean, I
mean what I said.

527
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,502
People scare me
more than anything.

528
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,272
I mean, what we
do to each other,

529
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,608
what we're doing
to the environment.

530
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,010
Just think about
the ozone layer,

531
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:23,182
and climate change, and I
mean, like, terrorist attacks.

532
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:29,722
I mean, the wolf in the
woods, it could be a person,

533
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,058
someone that wants to hurt us.

534
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,728
I mean, if it was a
wolf, then it's hungry,

535
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:40,031
but if it's a person,
it's just cruel.

536
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,534
Do you believe
in the supernatural?

537
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,571
I believe there's
something out there.

538
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:49,574
Everything has a
spirit, everything.

539
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:52,745
And with what people
do to each other,

540
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,414
they can be so
ugly to each other,

541
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,484
I feel like there
must be some kind

542
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:02,254
of vengeful deity,
or evil spirit.

543
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:10,830
Okay, so I found another
gem upstairs today.

544
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,432
Oh, you're not ready for this.

545
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,901
Oh, you are not ready for this.

546
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,402
Okay, I'm gonna show you.

547
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,403
Ta-da!

548
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,373
Right? Right?

549
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,343
Who keeps this?

550
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,680
Me, I'm gonna keep it.

551
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:32,483
This is hysterical.

552
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,253
Buttoned, unbuttoned,

553
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,124
buttoned,

554
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,525
unbuttoned.

555
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:41,727
Okay, I'm gonna button it.

556
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:45,430
This makes me feel like
one of those, like,

557
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:49,601
19th century matriarchs who
treats their kids like shit,

558
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,639
and then expects to be taken
care of when they're older.

559
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,811
Actually, you know, I can jut
hear the kids downstairs now.

560
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,382
And they're really hungry.

561
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,093
'Cause I forgot to
make their dinner.

562
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,532
He's gonna be so mad.

563
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,739
Hey, you're back.

564
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,109
Didn't know where you were.

565
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,377
Hey.

566
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,547
Did you find
the spooky animal,

567
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,616
snarling beast out in the woods?

568
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,284
- There's no animal.
- Nope.

569
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,386
Eh, what did I tell ya?

570
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,355
Hey, Simon.

571
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,290
You know, you're the most

572
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,960
fearful person I know, and uh...

573
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,494
Not.

574
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,063
Just form
knowing you for so long,

575
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,297
Dude.

576
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,532
And knowing
that you were afraid

577
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,934
of the high dive,
You don't go-

578
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,502
- And you,
basically, pissed your pants

579
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,038
the first horror
movie you went to see.

580
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,840
I wanna know what
you're afraid of.

581
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,175
You know what,
I'm gonna take a shit.

582
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,409
Come on.

583
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,644
And I'm gonna film
it for posterity,

584
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,280
and you can put it in
your little documentary.

585
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,116
Whatever, George can suck it.

586
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,953
Chinese piece of shit.

587
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,923
This place is spooky.

588
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:55,327
Oh, yeah, that's, that's nice.

589
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,462
There you go, George.

590
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,131
You can put that in your video.

591
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,133
Uh, hello?

592
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,936
Shit!

593
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:05,872
You know
what I'm gonna ask you,

594
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:08,407
'cause you're next, so...

595
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,110
You never played hockey,

596
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,780
but always had that stupid mask.

597
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:19,750
My biggest fear is
uh, slasher flicks,

598
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,088
or you know, masked killers.

599
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,424
I know it's generic
and, I don't know,

600
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,961
stereotypical, I guess,
but, I don't know.

601
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,864
George used to torture
me when we were kids.

602
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:36,134
He'd run around and, he
would wear that mask,

603
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:39,504
and I just, I don't
know, it scared me.

604
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,941
And I guess it stuck with me.

605
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,276
All right, camera.

606
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,446
All right.

607
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,148
Be careful with it.

608
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,683
Yeah, how do
you even operate this thing?

609
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,684
God.

610
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,054
Heavy.

611
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,459
Okay, so, George, what
is your biggest fear.

612
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,666
Really?

613
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,601
Well, you're movie.

614
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,005
You know what my
biggest fear is, kinda.

615
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,941
Well, I might, but the people

616
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:20,012
that are gonna be watching
the documentary don't.

617
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,282
My dad used to take
me to games, and,

618
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:27,052
like hockey games, and
baseball games all the time.

619
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,853
And he always used
to, after the trip

620
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,421
we would go out for
ice cream, and he would

621
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,691
tell me about how
when I grow up,

622
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,660
I'm gonna be just like
he is, and I'm gonna be

623
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,828
just as successful as
he is, and that one day

624
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,465
I'm gonna be able to
send my kids to school.

625
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,466
And...

626
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,337
I remember one time I
was telling him about

627
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:50,875
how maybe, that's not what
I wanted to do with my life.

628
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,578
And I remember the
look on his face was

629
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,446
the same look he gave
me when he tried to

630
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,450
break it to us that
mom was leaving.

631
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:04,590
And that's when I realized
that I can't let him down.

632
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,560
So, I'm afraid of failure.

633
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,563
That's the bottom line,
I'm just afraid of failing.

634
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,565
I can' fail.

635
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,370
Give me the camera back.

636
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,173
Hello?

637
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:27,645
Uh...

638
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,182
Hello?

639
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:34,852
Do...

640
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:37,923
Do you need help?

641
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:40,958
I have an idea.

642
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,161
What you thinkin'?

643
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,629
How would you feel about

644
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,334
going into the woods with
a camera by yourself.

645
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,237
You mean, not like, by myself,

646
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,139
I mean if you guys,
like, followed behind me.

647
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,507
No, that's the whole
point, it's by yourself.

648
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,875
That's the scary part about it.

649
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,144
That's what you're afraid of.

650
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,311
I'm not going in
there on my own.

651
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,613
Guys, guys, we're not alone.

652
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,648
There was somebody out here.

653
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,849
There was this little girl.

654
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,285
She was, I don't, I don't know.

655
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,519
Oh my god.

656
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,654
She was just walkin' around.

657
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:10,888
It was...

658
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,423
It was probably a deer.

659
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,758
A deer? It was a kid.

660
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,793
I saw it plain as day.

661
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:19,497
She was gone, I, I don't...

662
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,000
If there's a kid out there,
we should go try and find her.

663
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,369
You're afraid of the dark,

664
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,770
you're probably just spooked.

665
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,238
I am not makin' this up.

666
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,806
If there's a little girl,
we're gonna go find her.

667
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,341
So, let's go, okay?

668
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,177
Yeah.

669
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,010
Come on.

670
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,811
Come on, Simon.

671
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:34,112
You comin'?

672
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:34,946
This way?

673
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,182
Yeah.

674
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,718
I'm back.

675
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,987
Um, here we are again.

676
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:44,955
Uh, I'm in the
kitchen this time.

677
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,126
Um, things have been good.

678
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:51,096
I slept really, really,
well last night,

679
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,997
actually, surprisingly.

680
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:57,169
Um, I don't know, it was like
you were here last night.

681
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,706
It wasn't as lonely.

682
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,711
And it felt like
your arms were around me.

683
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,214
Um, I missed that.

684
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,883
Uh, yeah, uh, things
have been good.

685
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,220
It's been really
sunny out recently.

686
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,587
It's been gorgeous.

687
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,855
And, oh, okay.

688
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,725
So I bought these new
mugs that are so cute.

689
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,327
Look how cute these are.

690
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:27,031
We don't have room for them,
but I bought them anyways,

691
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,433
'cause I couldn't help myself.

692
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,734
I'm sorry, I love you.

693
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,603
Uh, but yeah, um, it's good.

694
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,972
I think my plan today is
to organize the kitchen

695
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,642
a little bit, 'cause I've
been focusing on other rooms.

696
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:40,178
So I'm gonna come back in here
and go through the plates,

697
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,616
and um, the spoons, and
all of that, but uh...

698
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,385
Oh! Okay!

699
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,953
So, I bought this new patio set.

700
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,156
And so, hopefully,
that's what's coming in.

701
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,090
Oh, you're gonna love it.

702
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,024
It's so cute, it's so cute.

703
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,526
We're gonna, um...

704
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,195
Um, hello?

705
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,770
Hello?

706
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:21,880
Hello?

707
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,249
Jesus.

708
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,085
Is anybody out here?

709
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,055
Hello?

710
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,930
So, how far
out did you see her?

711
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,799
It wasn't too
far, but then again,

712
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,336
I got kinda thrown
off, you know, I was,

713
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:48,373
she was there, and
then she wasn't, and...

714
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:49,440
Hey, hey, stay with the group,

715
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,176
don't go too far out.

716
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,679
I just wanna
find this little girl.

717
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,747
I'm not afraid of the woods.

718
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,417
I just don't wanna lose ya.

719
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,819
Lisa's one
with the woods, guys.

720
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,154
Hello?

721
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,125
Hey, we know you're out there.

722
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,061
Oh my god, stop. It's a deer.

723
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,130
Oh.

724
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:14,900
Was she like...

725
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:16,166
She looked lost.

726
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,335
Does she look like your age?

727
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,603
Uh, what, what was she?

728
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,770
Real, real, little.

729
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,171
She looked like, I don't know,

730
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,040
kids get lost on the
trail all the time.

731
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,075
Oh, yeah.

732
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,678
Come on, Lisa,
don't go that far ahead.

733
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,514
Okay.

734
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:29,647
Yeah.

735
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,115
She probably saw the fire

736
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:34,319
and wanted to, you know, she's
probably lookin' for help.

737
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,987
Yeah, maybe she saw
our fire, you know.

738
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,590
Maybe she's walking
towards our campsite.

739
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,526
- Nope.
- Hello?

740
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:42,159
She is not waiting.

741
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,794
Yeah, she's persistent.

742
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,830
I just wish we
could stay together.

743
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:50,001
All right,
I'm gonna, oh god, wait up.

744
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,272
Hey, don't leave me.

745
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,577
Everybody, stay together.

746
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,516
All right, uh, I'm back.

747
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,853
Um, last night was terrible.

748
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:13,157
Um, I woke up in the
middle of the night,

749
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:16,161
and um, scared
myself half to death,

750
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,465
actually is what happened.

751
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,400
Um, I don't know,
I, like, must have

752
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,635
just, like, been making
a video to, like,

753
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,538
say good night and
left the camera on.

754
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,307
And I, like, fell asleep, and
was sleeping really soundly,

755
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,877
and then something,
I don't know.

756
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:35,145
There was some, like,
noise or some thud

757
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,981
that happened and scared
the shit out of me.

758
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,784
And I woke up and saw,
there's this red light

759
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:42,653
on the camera, and I don't
know what I thought it was,

760
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,424
like a rat, or like a
bug, I have no idea.

761
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:50,596
And, yeah, so um, but it's fine,

762
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,665
and it was my fault,
and I guess I just

763
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,035
left the camera
rolling all night,

764
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:02,006
and didn't think about
it, and fell asleep.

765
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:05,443
Um, so I'm exhausted,

766
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:09,680
'cause I couldn't fall
back asleep, um, at all.

767
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,283
Um, but uh, yeah, things
are great in the house.

768
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:18,255
Um, it's not as drafty as it
has been the past couple days.

769
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,258
Um, 'cause I'd sealed off
some of the windows upstairs.

770
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:26,030
Um, I started painting the
second guest room, blue,

771
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,198
'cause that's your
favorite color.

772
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,036
Um, yeah, so it
looks really good.

773
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,971
Actually, I like
the shade of blue,

774
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,372
and actually, I'm
doing a lot better job

775
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,307
than I thought I would.

776
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,175
It all looks really even.

777
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,176
Um...

778
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:46,517
I miss you, so, like,
that hasn't changed.

779
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:49,319
Um, and hopefully I'll sleep

780
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,091
really well tonight
because I'm so exhausted.

781
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:55,993
Yeah.

782
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,265
- So.
- It's me.

783
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,101
Is anyone else
freaked out about

784
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,771
not finding that little girl?

785
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,406
I mean, I'm worried for her.

786
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,741
Yeah.

787
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,310
Just a little bit.

788
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:16,447
I...

789
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:17,948
What?

790
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,786
I didn't expect
to see somethin' like that.

791
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:22,787
None of us did.

792
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,054
It's so weird,
a little girl in

793
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:27,625
the middle of the
woods by herself.

794
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,626
Yeah.

795
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,233
Yeah.

796
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,969
I mean, there's gotta
be an explanation.

797
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,473
You think maybe, uh,

798
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,374
I mean you know where we're at,

799
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,678
I mean, you think it
might have been a ghost?

800
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,647
Oh, come on.

801
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,915
Oh, come on with that, dude.

802
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:51,949
It could be.

803
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,551
It, you never know.

804
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,319
There is no such
thing as ghosts.

805
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,987
You're so certain?

806
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,556
Well...

807
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,324
I mean, you don't see them.

808
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,760
You know how sometimes
you look at, like,

809
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:06,597
a really tall,
looming, twisty, tree,

810
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,899
and it just looks kinda evil?

811
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,335
Like, you see it.

812
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:13,938
Nah.

813
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,339
You lost me.
That's what I believe in.

814
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,941
That...

815
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,276
You just don't get it.

816
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,512
No one gets it.

817
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:24,682
I mean, other than that

818
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,817
it's been a pretty good trip.

819
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,152
I would...

820
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,788
Yeah, speaking of, great.

821
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,490
Oh god, ew, that's
my brother, that's...

822
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,225
- ew.
- Great.

823
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,763
I feel sorry for you.

824
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:40,130
Is it like this all
the time with them?

825
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,800
Oh god, I don't
know, probably.

826
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:43,735
Come on.

827
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:44,735
Ew.

828
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:48,272
Well, uh, just
throwin' it out there,

829
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,775
I mean, this would be

830
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:54,713
the perfect opportunity
for a threesome.

831
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,783
Ho ho, oh my god, dude
I'm a graduate, okay.

832
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:00,752
My experimentation
days are over.

833
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,288
Yeah, we'll just be over here,

834
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,590
Harder.

835
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:07,592
And you can stay in
that part of the tent.

836
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:09,594
Well, I mean, - Yeah.

837
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,930
The offer's there.

838
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,600
Good night, Simon.

839
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,877
Okay, I'm back.

840
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:30,615
So, um, yeah, I've
just been feeling

841
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:34,184
really creeped out
being here along.

842
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,521
Um, yeah, so I um,
I went and talked

843
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,691
to Doctor Stevens
again, and she told me

844
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,027
that I should learn
how to face my fears

845
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,796
head on and do some
research on the house,

846
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:48,098
because then, maybe,
I'd feel better

847
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,335
if I knew some of
the history of it.

848
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,803
I don't know, whatever.

849
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,539
So, I went to the library
and found this book.

850
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,943
So, um, I'm gonna
read you some of it.

851
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:02,280
Um, okay, um, in 1974
a family were found

852
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,584
shot dead in their
beads, and the oldest son

853
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,287
was found guilty of
committing the crime.

854
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:13,190
He had claimed that
an evil presence

855
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,059
was speaking to him
throughout the house

856
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,527
and that it had, in
many ways, seduced him

857
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,463
into committing the crime.

858
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:22,700
He's still in
prison to this day.

859
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,669
Since then, several
families have moved

860
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,338
into the house and shortly
have left afterwards

861
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,242
claiming that the
house is haunted.

862
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:37,682
Okay, um, well that explains
how all this furniture

863
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:40,150
has just been left over.

864
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,688
This place is like
an estate auction.

865
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,589
However, two of the
families who claimed

866
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,925
to experience paranormal
activity in the house

867
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,728
all went on to attempt
to gain publicity

868
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,731
for books and movies
using their experiences,

869
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,934
which has deeply harmed the
validity of their claims.

870
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,705
Most find it to
be outright lies.

871
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:03,741
You hear that, sweetheart?

872
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,543
We could be famous.

873
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:10,580
Um, well, while I
was at the library

874
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,649
I found another
book that I thought

875
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,652
would help me even more.

876
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,322
So I found this gem.

877
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,926
Um, let me just show you
the first page of this

878
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:25,696
so you can just really see what
I'm dealing with right now.

879
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:28,332
Uh...

880
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,069
I'm so lonely, if
you can't tell.

881
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,838
And so needy.

882
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,442
Um, I want you to come home.

883
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,910
Yeah, 'cause this, this, this,

884
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,479
this book ain't,
it's not cuttin' it.

885
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,751
So, um, yeah.

886
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,653
I miss you a lot.

887
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:54,258
Yep.

888
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:05,536
What are you doing?

889
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,910
You missed all the good parts.

890
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,614
Do you love me?

891
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,050
Of course.

892
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,587
Would you do anything for me?

893
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:24,588
Yeah.

894
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,230
Okay.

895
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,565
Look.

896
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:37,435
It's the house.

897
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:39,937
The house.

898
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:40,938
Yeah, like, the
one from all the stories.

899
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:41,939
This is it.

900
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,775
I didn't want the other guys

901
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:45,710
to see it and get
all freaked out

902
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:46,911
'cause we're camped right around

903
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,147
the corner from it,
but, this is it.

904
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,951
Can we go back?

905
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:54,952
There's
nothin' to be afraid of,

906
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,454
it's just a house.

907
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,090
Pretty cool though, right?

908
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,592
Yeah, yeah, sure.

909
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,763
Let-lets go back.

910
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:08,299
Let's go back.

911
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,275
Hi, it's me.

912
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,412
Um, I actually feel a lot better

913
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:26,783
after having done all that
research on the house.

914
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:31,388
And um, I don't know, maybe
Doctor Stevens was right

915
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:35,259
that we're just afraid
of what we don't know.

916
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,028
So, yeah, it was a good day.

917
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:41,565
And um, I have a lot planned
for tomorrow, actually.

918
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:45,736
And um, I miss you!

919
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:42,792
Can't sleep?

920
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,162
Nope.

921
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:47,498
Mind if I join ya?

922
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,334
Not if you're gonna film me.

923
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,570
I'm just using the light.

924
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:56,274
All right.

925
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,921
You can't sleep either?

926
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:11,922
Nah.

927
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:37,375
I ended up calling
the police last night.

928
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,445
I just woke up,
and I kept hearing

929
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:44,449
all of these noises,
and I didn't...

930
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,718
I didn't know what to do.

931
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,888
And they showed up,
and they were so nice,

932
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,690
and so polite, and
they walked all the way

933
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,326
around the house, and
in every single room,

934
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,827
and all the way in the basement.

935
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,828
And I...

936
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,768
And there was nothing.

937
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,305
Nothing in this house except me.

938
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:14,045
So, by process of
elimination I'm the problem.

939
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,122
I just, I don't get it.

940
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,790
You know, I have a
12 year old sister,

941
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,192
and she can stay
home by herself,

942
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:29,593
but me, I can't.

943
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,762
I can't be here by myself.

944
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,033
But you know, the one good thing

945
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,369
about the police
showing up is that

946
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,940
every single neighbor came
out to see what was going on.

947
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:47,678
And there I was in my
pajamas on the porch...

948
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:51,516
Like a moron.

949
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:57,188
Because there was
nothing in the house.

950
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:16,673
You know...

951
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:24,682
I should be able to do this.

952
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:30,620
I want you to come home
and be proud of me,

953
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:33,724
and all the work
that I've done here.

954
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,699
I'm really sorry.

955
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,412
Okay, well I ordered some
new stuff for upstairs.

956
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:58,015
Hopefully, that's what that is.

957
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:11,329
Hi, um, yeah let's
just go around back.

958
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,864
That'd be great.

959
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,973
Okay, guys, we're close.

960
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,042
So, Elizabeth,
what do you think

961
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:29,214
about your hike of
the damned in these

962
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:32,617
spooky, ghost filled woods?

963
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,084
It's a little more
annoying when you

964
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,853
have that camera in
my face all the time.

965
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,054
I can get closer.

966
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:38,989
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

967
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,158
Oh, what's on that?

968
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,029
But yeah, so far
so good, I guess.

969
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,131
What's wrong with
your girlfriend?

970
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:49,733
She's just driving me crazy.

971
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,034
We still goin' the right way?

972
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:52,602
Yeah.

973
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,704
Yeah, mister
nature man with his compass.

974
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:55,705
I'm sure of it.

975
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:00,176
Back this way, sorry.

976
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:00,978
Ah.

977
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:01,812
Watch it.

978
00:53:01,813 --> 00:53:03,481
Brilliant.

979
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:12,389
Ow.

980
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,260
Look out for that, Simon.

981
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,694
Like...

982
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,329
Somebody should
start putting flowers it it.

983
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,564
It'll probably stay in.

984
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:21,831
This is exactly
what you wanted.

985
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:24,902
This is what the
documentary's about.

986
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:27,505
Looking good.

987
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,938
Awe, you look so pretty.

988
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:29,807
Awe, thank you.

989
00:53:29,808 --> 00:53:31,309
Uh-Huh.

990
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,712
I'm over it, I'm...

991
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,149
Oh, it's you two again.

992
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,286
I see you got some more
friends with you this time.

993
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:45,088
You got your camp site set
up for tonight, all ready?

994
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:48,458
No, I think we're gonna
hit the road after this.

995
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,993
Well, if you change your mind,

996
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,929
you make sure you stay to
that campsite after dark.

997
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,099
It's dangerous out
here like I told you.

998
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,468
Dangerous, like a ghost?

999
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:00,904
A lot of people think
this is a haunted area.

1000
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,005
Don't be stupid, boy.

1001
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:03,907
I'm talkin' about wild animals.

1002
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:07,244
Sir, uh, last night
you had mentioned,

1003
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,780
uh, you were looking
for your daughter.

1004
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,851
Um, we, one of us
might have possibly

1005
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,555
seen something that
was uh, may have been,

1006
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,325
um, a child in the woods.

1007
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,092
This guy thinks he saw it.

1008
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,093
Where?

1009
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,833
Like, up, up
the hill back that way.

1010
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:32,436
All right, just
remember what I said.

1011
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:33,970
Stay out of these
woods after night.

1012
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,606
Stick to your campground
and you'll be safe.

1013
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,442
Oh, sure.

1014
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:39,043
Okay.

1015
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,613
Come on, he's.

1016
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,948
Got that goin'?

1017
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,516
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool, good.

1018
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,618
All right, guys, we're
staying one more night.

1019
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,886
What? No.

1020
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,355
What are you talking about?

1021
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,022
Uh-uh, dude, that's
not what I signed up for.

1022
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,058
Listen, we're gonna
pack up these tents,

1023
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,225
we're gonna pack up our bags,

1024
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,428
we're gonna go
about 100 more yards

1025
00:54:58,429 --> 00:54:59,796
into the woods, and we're
gonna stay one more night.

1026
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,064
That's all I'm askin'.

1027
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,432
- Uh...
- That's asking a lot.

1028
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,368
That's asking a lot.

1029
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,868
Why, 'cause you're scared?

1030
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:05,803
- Exactly.
- We're all scared.

1031
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:07,971
Right, that's the point.

1032
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,105
For fear, right?

1033
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:10,074
That's what this
documentary's all about.

1034
00:55:10,075 --> 00:55:11,575
'Cause we're all scared, right?

1035
00:55:11,576 --> 00:55:12,809
We all came...

1036
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,977
So we're staying
one more night.

1037
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,211
We're gonna get
everything packed up,

1038
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:17,080
and we're gonna stay
one more night out there

1039
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:18,448
and really get what
we need to get.

1040
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,249
We signed up to sit
around a camp fire

1041
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,752
and talk about what makes
us, w-what our fears are.

1042
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:23,688
We didn't sign up...

1043
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:25,154
Yeah, dude, I'm not...

1044
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,590
We're not
expecting to run into a man

1045
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:27,392
in the woods with a gun.
Not cool with this.

1046
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:28,393
Everything's gonna be

1047
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:29,059
- completely fine.
- Whoa.

1048
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,059
Listen.

1049
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,261
The reason I have this,
That's nice.

1050
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,298
Is so everyone
knows I'm not gonna

1051
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:36,600
let anything happen to you.

1052
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:38,402
We're safe, okay?

1053
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:39,869
So if you're
worried about safety

1054
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,038
or you're afraid of
being hurt out there,

1055
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,873
no one's gonna get hurt.

1056
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,875
I won't let you get hurt.

1057
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:48,211
So let's pack everything up,
and let's go to the woods.

1058
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:49,446

1060
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,049

1061
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,552
and help me pack up this stuff.

1062
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,756
Hi, babe. It's me.

1063
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:03,192
Um, I'm gonna do another
aerobics work out,

1064
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,696
try to keep the routine goin'.

1065
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,701
Okay, here we go.

1066
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:33,723
Hello?

1067
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:39,129
Hi, yeah, uh, no, no, I asked
for the linoleum flooring.

1068
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,032
Yeah, yeah, okay,
I'll be here all week.

1069
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,634
So...

1070
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,570
Friday morning would be great.

1071
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,637
Yeah, just let me
know whenever works

1072
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,806
for you guys and I'll be...

1073
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:50,807
Hold on.

1074
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:12,797
Hello? Hello?

1075
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,737
I need you to face
your fears, all right?

1076
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:21,971
Okay.

1077
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,907
That means you
gotta go out there

1078
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:26,811
with this camera
by yourself, okay.

1079
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:30,413
Can't you go with me?

1080
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,648
No.

1081
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:33,049
Like, j-just follow,
just follow behind.

1082
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,218
The whole point is
that you're doing this

1083
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,722
by yourself in the dark, okay?

1084
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:42,827
Take this camera,
you'll be fine.

1085
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:44,728
All right?

1086
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,963
- Okay.
- Okay?

1087
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,300
Um, if I scream, I
mean, if I yell out

1088
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,938
or something, are you gonna,
are you gonna come get me?

1089
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,173
No, we're gonna
wave our flashlights

1090
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:59,510
and you can come to us, okay?

1091
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:01,579
Go ahead.

1092
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:02,412
Okay.

1093
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,647
All right.

1094
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:05,481
I don't wanna be alone.

1095
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,151
Exactly, go ahead.

1096
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,506
Oh god, oh god.

1097
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,375
Help!

1098
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,679
Okay where are they?

1099
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,914
Where are they?

1100
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:40,785
Help! Help me!

1101
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:46,090
Oh, thank god,
there they, there.

1102
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,682
Guys, I think, I
think I saw her.

1103
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:15,184
I think I saw the little girl.

1104
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,120
All right, okay.

1105
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:17,654
She, was back there.

1106
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:21,025
Okay, we'll
find her, we'll find her.

1107
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:29,199
Oh.

1108
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,534
Wha...

1109
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,208
We need to go find help.

1110
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:42,880
We need to go, we need
to go, we need to go.

1111
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,188
Ooh, all right.

1112
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,423
Welcome to the back yard.

1113
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,160
Um, so I'm just tryin'
to clean some stuff up

1114
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:59,562
before the contractors
come out again.

1115
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:03,066
Um, yeah, our
contractor's name is Tony.

1116
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:04,233
And he talks to me like

1117
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:07,637
I don't know anything
about building.

1118
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,505
You know, which may
or may not be true,

1119
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:11,708
but he's still a sexist.

1120
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,544
But it's fine, um,
so, um, oh god,

1121
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,614
I'll clean up all
of this eventually.

1122
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,984
Oh, okay, so I
wanna show you, um,

1123
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:22,251
I don't know, the
foundation around

1124
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,553
the corner of the house
has been really weird.

1125
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,522
Like, on this end, well this,
well this is the sun room

1126
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,958
on this side, and then
this is the living room,

1127
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,694
but it's been, like, sinking.

1128
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:34,130
Now I don't really know,
like, what's going on.

1129
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,000
But I, oh, that was a be.

1130
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:38,001
But I was...

1131
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,262
Yep, nope.

1132
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,868
Okay, it's done, we're done.

1133
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:12,803
This is finished.

1134
01:01:12,804 --> 01:01:14,403
Let's get our packs and go.

1135
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,239
- Car now.
- No, I'm with you.

1136
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:16,206
I'm with you, let's go.

1137
01:01:16,207 --> 01:01:17,473
Okay, everybody grab a pack.

1138
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,978
Just screw the
tents, let's just go.

1139
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,193
Jesus.

1140
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,532
Guys, wait up a second.

1141
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,600
It's so dark, you need to

1142
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:47,104
walk in front with that light.

1143
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:55,478
This even the right way?

1144
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:56,712
- Yeah.
- I don't know,

1145
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,947
I feel like we've
been walking forever.

1146
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:00,517
Just keep goin' this way.

1147
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:07,824
Seriously,
we've been walking forever.

1148
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:11,996
It's all right,
we're goin' the right way.

1149
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:24,775
We've been goin' north for
the last hour and a half.

1150
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:28,044
There's no way that we're
goin' the wrong way.

1151
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:32,216
We've been going in a
straight line this whole time.

1152
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,818
So, I think we should just

1153
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,485
continue going in
a straight line.

1154
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,923
Does anybody else have any
better ideas than that?

1155
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:40,858
- Anybody?
- I don't know.

1156
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:41,859
I guess just keep going north.

1157
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,460
Exactly.

1158
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,770
Didn't anybody bring
a map or something?

1159
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:03,412
Okay, so I went back outside,

1160
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:07,584
after composing myself and
building up the courage to do so.

1161
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:13,423
And it turns out that
it was rust water.

1162
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,960
So, that's why it was
red, because it's just

1163
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:18,862
been raining a lot,
and it must have

1164
01:03:18,863 --> 01:03:21,798
just gone through
the pipes, and...

1165
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,302
Yeah, but I didn't
have to call anyone,

1166
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,371
and I figured it out by myself,

1167
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:31,541
and progress.

1168
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:36,981
So, maybe now I can go fix
the toilet by myself too.

1169
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:43,353
I can do this.

1170
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,658
Watch out.

1171
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,829
None of this looks familiar.

1172
01:03:58,869 --> 01:03:59,836
None of it looks familiar.

1173
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:02,072
Exactly, that's a good thing.

1174
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:10,646
Do you wanna hold
on to the compass?

1175
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:11,581
Do you, would you feel better

1176
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:13,716
being in charge of the compass?

1177
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:16,120
I don't know what else to do.

1178
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,158
And we're stuck.

1179
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,394
We are, we hiked, and we hiked,

1180
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:28,132
and we hiked, and
we got nowhere.

1181
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:32,336
I don't know what's goin' on.

1182
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:40,376
What we need to do is
go find that little girl

1183
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,879
and make sure that she's safe.

1184
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:45,214
She's right.

1185
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,815
I'll go.

1186
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,251
I'm gonna go too.

1187
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:49,519
Nah, I'll go.

1188
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:53,489
You go straight,
and it meets back up...

1189
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,324
W-w, uh, hold up, um, uh...

1190
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,593
We took it earlier, we
took this path earlier.

1191
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,228
You go straight, I'm
gonna go left, okay.

1192
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,396
It meets back up.

1193
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,365
Uh...

1194
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:03,300
Just do it, just trust me.

1195
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:05,034
I have a lantern, I'll be fine.

1196
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,003
Just go straight,
I'll go this way.

1197
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,171
We'll cover more
ground that way,

1198
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:09,405
and we'll find the little girl,

1199
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,207
we'll meet back up, and
we'll go back to camp.

1200
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,308
Okay?

1201
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,709
- Just go.
- Fine.

1202
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:14,710
- Just go, just go, just go.
- Whatever.

1203
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:15,911
We have to do this.

1204
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:16,713
- [All right.
- Elizabeth] All right.

1205
01:05:16,714 --> 01:05:18,048
Hello?

1206
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,354
Nothin'.

1207
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:28,324
I made a couple rounds,
and there's nothing.

1208
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:29,559
Shit.

1209
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,602
Simon!

1210
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,139
Simon!

1211
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:04,027
Oh my god.

1212
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:06,895
Shit.

1213
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:09,933
Oh shit, oh, oh my god.

1214
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:14,938
Oh shit!

1215
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,309
Back on the trail, it forks.

1216
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:22,545
His blood's all over my hands.

1217
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:23,846
I thought we could
cover more ground

1218
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:26,283
if we split up, and he was...

1219
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,696
Oh my god.

1220
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,331
Guys, I have a radio.

1221
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,966
Oh, god.

1222
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,035
Oh thank god.

1223
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:52,575
Hello, if there's anybody out,

1224
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,709
if there's anybody out there,

1225
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,146
this is an emergency,
we need help.

1226
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:11,961
What was that?

1227
01:07:13,097 --> 01:07:15,865
We need help. We need help.

1228
01:07:24,308 --> 01:07:25,175
What was that?

1229
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,110
I don't know.

1230
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,810
What the hell was that.

1231
01:07:26,811 --> 01:07:27,877
I don't know!

1232
01:07:29,313 --> 01:07:31,714
We, we didn't
find the little girl.

1233
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:35,318
We're not gonna
find the little girl.

1234
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:37,286
We didn't
find the little girl.

1235
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:39,855
We're not gonna
find the little girl.

1236
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,124
Just, just sit tight.

1237
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,325
It's okay.

1238
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:43,959
We didn't
find the little girl.

1239
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,761
Lisa, we're not gonna
find the little girl.

1240
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:46,962
The little girl is gone!

1241
01:07:46,963 --> 01:07:48,597
Lisa! Lisa, stay here!

1242
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:49,798
What do...

1243
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:50,700
We can't keep splitting up.

1244
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,635
Lisa!

1245
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:52,436
Lisa!

1246
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:54,603
Hey, wait up.

1247
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:55,772
Lisa, come on.

1248
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,209
I see the little girl.

1249
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,444
What?

1250
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:02,545
I see her, she's right there.

1251
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:03,480
Where?

1252
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:04,913
She's right there.

1253
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,682
There's nothing there.

1254
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,351
What? I'm going to her.

1255
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:09,618
Did you find her?

1256
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:11,454
I lost her, I
don't know where she is.

1257
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:12,821
Get your shit, and let's go.

1258
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,523
We gotta get outta here, now!

1259
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,360
Grab you bag, now, go!

1260
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,028
Come on! We gotta go.

1261
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,365
Wait up! Wait!

1262
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,936
Where, where'd you go?

1263
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:33,076
Little girl, little girl?

1264
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,115
Where are you, where'd you go?

1265
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:49,293
I know where you are.

1266
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,929
You wanna play with me?

1267
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,598
You wanna play?

1268
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,201
You wanna play with me? Yeah?

1269
01:08:58,202 --> 01:08:59,469
You wanna play?

1270
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:29,433
Oh my god! Stop!

1271
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:37,540
No! Stop! What are you, no!

1272
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:38,608
Let me go!

1273
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:57,393
Keep moving, go.

1274
01:09:57,394 --> 01:09:58,761
Go, go, faster, come on!

1275
01:09:58,762 --> 01:09:59,928
Would you shut up,

1276
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,064
and turn that
fucking camera off?

1277
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:03,732
It's our only proof

1278
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:04,733
of what's goin' on right here,

1279
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,669
and it's providing us light!

1280
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,271
You know what,
professor, you wanted fear?

1281
01:10:08,272 --> 01:10:09,472
You fucking found it!

1282
01:10:09,473 --> 01:10:10,473
Fuck you!

1283
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,520
Move. Go, go, go!

1284
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:26,290
We are.

1285
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:28,392
You're not movin' fast enough.

1286
01:10:28,393 --> 01:10:29,525
We gotta get outta here, now.

1287
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:32,128
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1288
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:43,373
We gotta get outta here, go.

1289
01:10:43,374 --> 01:10:44,973
Go, go, go, go now!

1290
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:49,145
Shut up, shut,
shut, don't talk, don't talk.

1291
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:51,515
Where is she?

1292
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:55,985
Take the light.

1293
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:56,953
What? No.

1294
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:57,654
Take the light.

1295
01:10:57,655 --> 01:10:58,921
But.

1296
01:10:58,922 --> 01:10:59,756
Do remember that
house I showed you?

1297
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,023
Yeah.

1298
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,758
Go straight to that
house and don't stop.

1299
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:03,693
Come.

1300
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:04,827
Just go, I will find you.

1301
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:05,994
No, no, no...

1302
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,229
- I will find you.
- Come with me.

1303
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,265
Baby, I promise,
I will find you, go.

1304
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:13,503
Oh god, oh
god, oh god, oh god.

1305
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,119
Jesus Christ.

1306
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:36,692
Help!

1307
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,463
Somebody help me!

1308
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:43,732
Help!

1309
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:02,612
Hey, hey, everything's fine.

1310
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:06,850
You're okay.

1311
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,685
Everything's goin' great.

1312
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:10,686
Okay?

1313
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:13,122
Everything's fine.

1314
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,961
Listen, this is gonna
be perfect, I promise.

1315
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:21,731
But I need your help, okay?

1316
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:26,570
I know this is gonna be
scary, and that's okay.

1317
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:31,174
'Cause it's gonna be perfect.

1318
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:46,449
Tag.

1319
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,153
You're it.
