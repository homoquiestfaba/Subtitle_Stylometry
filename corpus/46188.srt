1
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,139
Akelei. Akelei.

2
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,176
Claire?

3
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:22,256
- Move up.
- Thank you.

4
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:34,136
Roast mules go topsy-turvy.

5
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:37,375
Ten letters ending in "T."

6
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,895
- I'm hopeless at this.
- Me too.

7
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:42,855
"Somersault. "

8
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,255
Bletchley.

9
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,854
It's a walk.

10
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,134
I know.

11
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:04,734
I've been here before.

12
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:09,334
This bus for Yardley--

13
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,254
This bus for--

14
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:39,093
Hello? Yes.
I'll try that extension for you.

15
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,332
Please hold the line.

16
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,612
I'm just putting you through.

17
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:47,172
Yes, you're through.

18
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,172
- Mr Skynner?
- Come in.

19
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,532
It's been a pleasure, sir.

20
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:55,132
I never wanted you back.

21
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,452
Logie says he needs you.

22
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:02,091
Well...

23
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:04,411
he's got you.

24
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:10,251
Conference in half an hour.
And keep your mouth shut.

25
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:12,971
You're only there for show.

26
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,729
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
You do look bloody terrible.

27
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,409
- We missed you, Tom.
- I know why you want me back, Guy.

28
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,809
You've lost the crown jewels,
haven't you? You've lost Shark.

29
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,849
We got a call from one of the
intercept stations in Scarborough.

30
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,288
And they started picking up a single
word broadcast on the hour, every hour...

31
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,688
coming out of U-boat headquarters
in Sainte-Assise.

32
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,408
- In Morse?
- No, it was a human voice.

33
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:13,608
- "Akelei. "
- Meaning what?

34
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,048
- It's a flower.
- I know it's a bloody flower, Guy.

35
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:20,568
Aquilegia. Columbine.
But what did it mean?

36
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:24,087
It meant,
"Change the weather code. "

37
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:28,447
The Germans have switched their U-boats to
a new code book, and we're blacked out again.

38
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,847
Is that why the Yanks are here?

39
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:32,967
Skynner's in a panic.

40
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:35,847
They want to take over his empire.

41
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:39,287
Here comes our team.

42
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:50,246
- You! You!
- Hello.

43
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:55,006
- You in the Royal Navy?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

44
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:58,326
- Only for a day or two. I mean, actually on a ship.
- What was your ship?

45
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:02,286
Look, I can't be expected
to remember every little thing.

46
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,046
Sorry.

47
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:08,565
Welcome to Bletchley Park, sir.

48
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:11,085
Three convoys left New York
in the past week...

49
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,885
and are presently at sea.

50
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,085
Convoy SC 122.

51
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:19,925
Fifty merchant ships
carrying fuel oil, tanks...

52
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:24,725
iron ore, bauxite,
also meat, sugar and wheat.

53
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,924
Convoy HX 229 departed
New York on Monday.

54
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:31,324
Forty merchant vessels
carrying explosives, manganese...

55
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:33,964
timber, powdered milk.

56
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,524
Convoy 229-A left New York
on Tuesday...

57
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,724
carrying steel, timber,
powdered milk.

58
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:43,124
I don't want a shopping list.
What's the total?

59
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:46,804
One hundred and forty-one merchant ships,
gross tonnage just under a million tons.

60
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:50,003
- Plus cargo of another million.
- And where are the U-boats?

61
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:55,603
A submarine tracking rumour
had three U-boat packs operational...

62
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:59,363
in the North Atlantic
as of 00 hundred Thursday...

63
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:02,243
here, here and here.

64
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:05,363
Midnight Wednesday?

65
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,803
- So where are the U-boats now?
- I'm afraid I have no idea.

66
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:15,122
I thought that was why we were here.
Our intelligence has been shut off.

67
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:18,322
You're telling us that the largest
assembly of merchant shipping...

68
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,482
we've ever sent
across the North Atlantic...

69
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:23,482
is now steaming towards
the largest concentration of U-boats...

70
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,322
the Germans have ever put
in the North Atlantic...

71
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,042
and you don't know where the hell
the goddam U-boats are?

72
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:32,321
- Gentlemen, if I may--
- Shut up.

73
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,801
What are our convoys making, hmm?

74
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,121
Something over 220 miles a day.

75
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,041
Well, I'd say we have
four days, maximum...

76
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:49,761
before the convoys come in operational
range of where you last had the enemy.

77
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:52,600
So, Leonard, this blackout--

78
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,080
will it be over in four days?

79
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,240
Uh, it's possible.

80
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,520
Yes, well, all things are possible,
Leonard, but is it likely?

81
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:03,360
Is it likely that you can break this
code, this, um-- What'd you call this?

82
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:07,120
This Shark? Before our convoys come
in range of the U-boats.

83
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:10,880
- We'll give it every priority.
- Yes, I know damn well you'll give it every priority, Leonard.

84
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,159
- That's not the question.
- Well, sir, as you press me, yes, I think we may be able to do it.

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,279
Is that what you all believe?

86
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,119
Um, well, I suppose you could say we know more
about Shark now than we did the last time.

87
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,399
If Guy thinks we can do it,
I would certainly respect his opinion.

88
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,638
And you?

89
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,998
You don't seem
to have much to say.

90
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,438
Tom Jericho. He's the one who got us into
reading Shark. If there’s anyone alive--

91
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,798
Can you break Shark again
in four days?

92
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,957
Have you any idea
what you’re talking about?

93
00:08:57,118 --> 00:09:00,117
Tom's been on sick leave for the last month,
so I don't think he's fully in the picture--

94
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,317
Enigma is a very sophisticated
enciphering machine...

95
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:06,037
and Shark
is its ultimate refinement...

96
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:10,037
so we're not talking
about The Times' crossword.

97
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:13,917
It weighs 26 pounds,
battery included...

98
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:16,076
and goes anywhere.

99
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:19,516
The Enigma machine.
The Germans have thousands of them.

100
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,516
What's it do?

101
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,316
It turns plain-text messages
into gobbledygook.

102
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,076
Then the gobbledygook
gets transmitted in Morse.

103
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:31,876
At the receiving end, there's another Enigma
machine to turn it back into the original message.

104
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,036
Press the same key any number of times,
it will always come out different.

105
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:38,915
- And you have one of your own.
- Courtesy of the Polish Cipher Bureau.

106
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:42,115
So what's the problem?

107
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:44,395
Problem?

108
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:49,395
The problem is the machine has 115 million
million million ways of doing it...

109
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:53,275
according to how you set these three
rotors and how you connect these plugs.

110
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:55,155
And that's Shark.

111
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:58,275
No. No, no, no.
This is the one we can break.

112
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:02,394
Shark is enciphered on a machine with a fourth
rotor specially developed for U-boats...

113
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:07,154
which gives it about 4, 000 million
billion different starting positions.

114
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:11,514
And, uh, we've never seen one.

115
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,834
Holy shit!

116
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,594
I haven't understood a word.

117
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:20,793
Can somebody give me a straight answer
to a straight question?

118
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:25,353
- Will this blackout definitely be over in--
- Nobody can say definitely, sir.

119
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,153
Yes or no?

120
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:35,313
- No.
- Thank you.

121
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:40,513
So it isn't over in four days.
When will it be over, hmm?

122
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,592
Hmm? Hmm? You.

123
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:49,552
Well, all I have to measure it by is how long
it took last time when Shark first came in.

124
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:52,872
- And how long did it take?
- Ten months.

125
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,192
Well, this is a great day
for Adolf Hitler.

126
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:59,472
Ten months?

127
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:02,271
But you did break it?

128
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,111
Yes.

129
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:07,871
- How?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

130
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:16,911
I think it's time we--

131
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:20,071
I think it's time
I got back to London.

132
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:39,070
It's not just a million tons of shipping.
It's a million tons of shipping every week!

133
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,790
It's our capability to supply Russia,
to support the army in North Africa...

134
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,109
to invade Europe
and drive the Germans out.

135
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,589
- It's the whole fucking war.
- Sir.

136
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,149
Satisfied? Now, send the stupid bugger
back to where he came from.

137
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,548
Don't waste a match.

138
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,828
Back to Mayfair?

139
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,828
No.

140
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,588
How many people knew
about the German weather code...

141
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,828
how important it was to us?

142
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:24,108
A dozen, maybe. Why?

143
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:26,507
Make me a little list?

144
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,147
What are you doing here,
Mr Wigram?

145
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,027
You think there's a spy
in Bletchley Park?

146
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:40,507
I'm Cave.
Naval Intelligence.

147
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:44,787
I'll be liaising with the admiralty.
They've given me an office in your hut.

148
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:50,026
I'm ultra-cleared.

149
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,506
- What does that mean?
- That means I know how you broke Shark, in principle.

150
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,746
You used a captured copy
of the German Navy's weather code book.

151
00:12:56,907 --> 00:13:00,266
Gave you a pretty good idea of what their
weather signals were supposed to be saying.

152
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:02,266
Can I see it?

153
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:07,386
Midnight, two days ago,
the Germans changed to a new book.

154
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:12,945
- So we lost that crib.
- Well, why do you think they did that just then?

155
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,585
Don't know.

156
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:17,625
And the other one?

157
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:20,105
Short signal code book.

158
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,865
The U-boats employ it for reporting
their position, course and speed.

159
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:27,305
Unfortunately, if you don't know where
the U-boat is or what it's doing...

160
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:30,545
the short signal code book
isn't much help as a crib.

161
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,624
Two men died
saving those little books...

162
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,704
from a sinking submarine.

163
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,024
Fasson and Grazier.

164
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:48,944
We caught the U-boat
on the surface in the eastern Med.

165
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:56,543
The sub went down when they were inside
trying to bring out its four-rotor Enigma.

166
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:02,943
November '42.
I was in destroyers.

167
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:05,783
It was my last ship.

168
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:11,303
Bletchley is the lucky number
in this war.

169
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:14,142
- One and six, please.
- One and six.

170
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,382
Here you are.

171
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,502
Girls, guess I'm off.

172
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,221
- See you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.

173
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,941
Miss Wallace?

174
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,021
Mr Jericho.
When did you get back?

175
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:54,261
Just today.
How, uh-- How are you?

176
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,540
How am I?

177
00:14:57,701 --> 00:15:00,860
Yeah, all right.
How is she?

178
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:03,980
She's-- She's Claire.

179
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:09,540
- Well, will you tell her?
- If I see her.

180
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,620
She hasn't been sleeping
at home the last two nights.

181
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,579
Sorry.

182
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,219
Good morning, sir.

183
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,818
- Worrying about your babies?
- Puck.

184
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:43,898
Thomas.

185
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,458
So, they say you’re
not crazy any more.

186
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:54,058
- It thinks it's found a possible.
- "It thinks"?

187
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,538
- Why not?
- Been in the hut?

188
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:00,457
- Come on. Get it over with.
- No, I'm fine, Puck.

189
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,457
Sure, you are.

190
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:06,177
Hey, Betty, wait for me!

191
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:11,097
Gentlemen, we have a ghost.

192
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:13,097
Tom, how the hell are you?

193
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:15,217
- Well. Very well.
- Have you escaped, or what?

194
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:17,457
- I thought this was the asylum.
- How are you?

195
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,616
- Good.
- Bloody hell!

196
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:22,536
- How's the revolution, Alec?
- Coming along, comrade. Coming along.

197
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:25,776
- T-- T-- T--
- Yes, it's me.

198
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:28,616
I, uh-- I want to see all the Shark
traffic we haven't been able to break.

199
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,896
- In at the deep end.
- Why not?

200
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:37,976
- Yes, why not?
- Have you got yesterday's Porpoises?

201
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,735
Open the file.

202
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:44,895
Besides, it wasn't really Shark
that made you crazy.

203
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:47,215
Was it, Tom?

204
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:51,215
I suppose you all know.

205
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:54,775
You think I made a fool of myself?

206
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:56,975
Forget about it.
You're among friends.

207
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,014
So, what about the code breakers?

208
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:08,174
King come, De Brooke,
Upjohn, Pukowski.

209
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:12,534
- Spot the odd one out.
- Puck lost his parents when Poland was invaded.

210
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:16,534
His kid brother is missing in action.
He hates the Germans.

211
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:20,134
Pinker?
Bit of an arty, isn't he?

212
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:22,334
He writes detective stories.

213
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:25,533
Baxter. They say he sleeps with
a picture of Stalin under his pillow.

214
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,733
Perhaps you haven't heard.
Stalin's on our side now.

215
00:17:27,894 --> 00:17:31,733
- And Jericho. The famous Mr Jericho.
- Mathematician.

216
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:36,573
Went off his trolley, didn't he?
About some girl.

217
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,333
We took him out of Cambridge
on the first day of the war.

218
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:43,973
He worked himself into a breakdown, so we
shipped him back to Cambridge to get well.

219
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,612
And that's all there is to it.

220
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:49,932
It's never all there is
to anything.

221
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,852
Shift's not over yet, ladies!

222
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:58,452
The 3:00's from Beaumanor
all need blisting.

223
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:07,051
You know, without your glasses,
you don't look half bad.

224
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,451
Do you know, without my glasses,
nor do you?

225
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,528
Claire?

226
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,807
I'm here.

227
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:35,127
Sorry it took an age.

228
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,247
Well, now you know where I am.

229
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,287
It's, um, off the beaten track.

230
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,087
Yes, well, it's better
than being snooped on by landladies.

231
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:46,807
Welfare found out I had a spare room,
so I had to share.

232
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:50,927
But Hester's a sweetie, really. Oh, there's
no sugar, I'm afraid, but it's lapsang.

233
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:54,486
And I always think sugar would
rather spoil lapsang, don’t you?

234
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:58,166
Don't know.
You're my first lapsang.

235
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:02,646
I knew you’d ask me out.

236
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:07,926
- I thought you asked me out.
- Well, I had to get you started. Aren't there any pretty girls in Hut 8?

237
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:12,206
- How do you know where I work?
- We've got an interesting men tracking room in Hut 3.

238
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,685
- You're not supposed to tell me where you--
- Besides, you're rumoured to have done something very clever...

239
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,325
and I want to know what it is.

240
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,165
Oh, my God.
Where did they find you?

241
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:24,365
Oh, where did they find any of us?
I'm the lucky one.

242
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,725
You know, they've got perfectly clever
girls working like post office clerks.

243
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:30,965
Not like me
on the German book.

244
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,004
I want that for my scrapbook.

245
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:39,324
- Can I see it?
- If you want. It's upstairs.

246
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:44,404
That's Hester.

247
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:49,924
And this is me.

248
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,483
You've been busy.

249
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:06,763
- Where is this?
- Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where I'd like to be old.

250
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:10,683
If I'm ever old.
Do you think it's beautiful?

251
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:57,161
Why are you a mathematician?
Do you like sums?

252
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,400
I like numbers.

253
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:05,480
Because with numbers,
truth and beauty are the same thing.

254
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:09,640
You know you’re getting somewhere
when the equations start looking...

255
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:12,520
beautiful.

256
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:16,720
And you know the numbers are taking you
closer to the secret of how things are.

257
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,359
A rose is just plain text.

258
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,995
My God.
What have you done?

259
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:57,275
What has she done?

260
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,155
- Mr Jericho?
- Miss Wallace.

261
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:04,235
I came looking for Claire.
I was worried about her.

262
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:07,714
I could fill a bus with men
who are worried about Claire Romilly...

263
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,314
but that's no reason why
I shouldn't go to the police.

264
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:13,834
She'd be the first person
they'd arrest.

265
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,754
Miss Wallace,
please put that poker down.

266
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,274
And if you know where she is,
for God's sake, tell me.

267
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:28,513
She's gone missing.

268
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,393
What are those, exactly?

269
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:37,073
Intercepts. German signals.

270
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:39,913
Yes, I know that much.

271
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:43,793
Five- letter groups. German Navy signals
are sent in four-letter groups.

272
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:46,593
So this must be army
or Luftwaffe.

273
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,592
Picked up by the radio scanners
at Beaumanor.

274
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:53,872
All sent between 9:30 and midnight
on April 17, nine days ago.

275
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:58,152
- But never deciphered.
- How do you know that?

276
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:01,952
Well, if it'd gone through the machine,
then plain text would be stuck on the back.

277
00:25:02,113 --> 00:25:05,552
All from the same source.
"ADU. ADU. "

278
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,792
Does the call sign ADU
mean anything to you, Miss Wallace?

279
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:13,151
Miss Wallace?

280
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,271
"Angels Dance Upwards. "

281
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,271
- What?
- Well, that's how we'd reference it.

282
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:23,231
- Who is it? Who is ADU?
- I don't know.

283
00:25:23,392 --> 00:25:26,431
But you could find out.

284
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,831
Do you have any idea
what you’re saying?

285
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:34,590
We can't just go digging through Bletchley looking
for information about missing cryptograms.

286
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:38,630
If we want to find Claire, then we need
to find out what she was hiding.

287
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:43,270
- You think Claire is a traitor.
- Would it matter if she were?

288
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:47,150
Of course it matters.
Look...

289
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:50,990
she was probably flirting with an officer
and forgot to file those intercepts...

290
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,589
so she hid them
rather than get told off.

291
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,509
Or she stole them
and then she ran away.

292
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,349
You really are mad,
aren't you?

293
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,349
And I would have to be even madder to have any
part in this little amateur sleuthing adventure.

294
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,589
Miss Wallace.
Miss Wallace!

295
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,389
You said yourself
that she was missing.

296
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,628
Now, is that normal?
Is that her habit?

297
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,228
Well, she does always come home
to change her clothes.

298
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:22,508
Well, there you are.

299
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,228
Is she seeing anyone,
do you know?

300
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,988
What exactly is your interest here?

301
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:37,187
You can reach me at Armstrong's
Guest House in Albion Street.

302
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:43,947
ADU, Miss Wallace.

303
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,867
Angels Dance Upwards.

304
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:56,866
# They call it Black Bottom
the new twister #

305
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,986
# It's sure got 'em
and, oh, sister #

306
00:26:59,147 --> 00:27:03,386
# They clap their hands
and do a raggedy flop
and hop #

307
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:05,586
# Old fellows
with lumbago #

308
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:07,786
# And high yellow
The waves they go #

309
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:11,226
# They jump right in
and give us all that they've got #

310
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:15,946
# They say that when that river bottom's
covered with ooze #

311
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:23,585
You silly, silly girl.

312
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,345
These people keep
such funny hours.

313
00:27:32,506 --> 00:27:35,825
I haven't heard--
Oh, Mr Jericho!

314
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:40,064
You have a visitor.
You can have the parlour.

315
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,944
We don't have guests
in the bedrooms after 10:00.

316
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,664
Oh, Mrs Armstrong, it's perfectly
sweet of you to worry...

317
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:50,584
but I don't mind taking
the risk just this once.

318
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:55,344
Well, I suppose it's all right
if you’re from the park.

319
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:03,183
Mr Wigram, would you care
for a cup of Ovaltine?

320
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:05,103
Ovaltine?

321
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:07,743
I haven't had Ovaltine since--
no, no--

322
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:10,903
Ovaltine. Thank you.
I don't think my system could take it.

323
00:28:12,864 --> 00:28:14,623
What a charming house.

324
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:19,223
And hunting prints.
Do you hunt?

325
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:31,062
Where are you based?
Here?

326
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:37,022
Bliss.

327
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:41,541
What can I do for you,
Mr, um, Wigram?

328
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:45,221
There's something
I've been wondering about.

329
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:47,981
You're the man
who broke the U-boat code.

330
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:51,061
Hmm?
Champagne all around.

331
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:54,861
Happy days are here again,
all right?

332
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,181
Then you fell out of your pram.

333
00:28:58,742 --> 00:29:00,621
So what happened?

334
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,740
It was personal.

335
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:04,980
I can keep a secret.

336
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:11,020
Wonderful thing about war--

337
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:15,580
Peacetime is about keeping
the people in their place.

338
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:20,380
But then war breaks out,
and life was never so glorious.

339
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,899
The toiling masses
turn into heroes...

340
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,299
and their little women start dropping
their drawers like debutantes.

341
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,859
- Well, if that’s all you--
- And best of all, the swots.

342
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,659
Dragged out in a cloud of dandruff
from some dim backwater...

343
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,419
and invited to the ball.

344
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,979
At Bletchley, you're as glamorous
as fighter pilots.

345
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,218
Girls you couldn't even hope to meet
go weak at the knees...

346
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:48,618
at the thought of the size
of your brain, isn't that right?

347
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,698
If talking through your arse
is what they teach you in spy school--

348
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,858
I'm talking about you
and a girl called Claire Romilly.

349
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,058
We're rather worried about her.

350
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:03,338
Officially been missing for 14 hours, give or take.
When in fact, it's more like 48 hours.

351
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:06,737
She hasn't been seen
since she went off-duty on Thursday.

352
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:12,657
Rather a good friend
of yours, I gather.

353
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:16,817
I- I haven't seen her since befo--
since before I--

354
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:19,977
Quite.
Heard from her?

355
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:24,657
- No.
- Apart from the postcard.

356
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,776
Let's try to remember everything.

357
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:31,216
It saves misunderstandings.

358
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:39,176
Did you go to the cottage tonight?
Don't think about it.

359
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,056
- Yes.
- Yes.

360
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,096
Yes.

361
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:49,135
Mind if I sit down?

362
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:52,695
I've been away for a month.
I wanted to look her up.

363
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:56,015
You ever discuss
your work with her?

364
00:30:56,176 --> 00:31:00,735
- Of course not.
- Um, how about a gun?

365
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:03,015
- Any guns?
- A gun?

366
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:06,295
A gun from that museum of yours...

367
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:10,454
liberated from a captured U-boat along with the code
books, the captain's teddy bear and what have you.

368
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:14,054
All very improper and unsigned for,
but I turned a blind eye.

369
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:17,654
But no reason why you should know,
a chap like you.

370
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,814
Mind if I check the coat?

371
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,653
While we're at it--

372
00:31:56,893 --> 00:31:59,092
- You sure you don't mind?
- I'm beginning to.

373
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,612
You see my point, though,
don’t you?

374
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:09,612
One day the Germans black us out
in the North Atlantic.

375
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:13,011
Next day, girlfriend
of crack code breaker disappears--

376
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:15,451
vanishes.

377
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:19,811
- Code breaker returns, shiny new shooter goes missing.
- She's not my girlfriend.

378
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:23,171
Hmm? What is she, then?

379
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:26,491
We were-- I suppose the phrase is
"seeing each other"...

380
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,891
for about a month.

381
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:33,331
Is that what happened to you?

382
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,330
What?

383
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:39,050
Is Claire Romilly
what happened to you?

384
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,250
There was a concert.

385
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,649
I went on my own.

386
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,608
Oh, it’s you.
You found my slipper.

387
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,888
Afterwards, Claire, Hester--
Miss Wallace, who shares the cottage--

388
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,688
and I, we came out together.

389
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,808
Next week was going to be Bach.

390
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:35,808
Oh, we must go.

391
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:38,527
Oh, I can't.
I'm on the night shift.

392
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:40,607
Oh, Hester. Poor you.

393
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,887
"Poor you, " she said.
That's one of her phrases.

394
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:46,687
So, I asked her.

395
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:51,127
I say, I hope you don't think it
fresh of me, but should we go together?

396
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:56,927
Of course you did.
And, uh, after that?

397
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,646
After that?

398
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,646
I had the happiest month
of my whole life.

399
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,406
Not happiest. Something.

400
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:13,206
- You can! You can.
- I can't.

401
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:16,206
You can. Yes.

402
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:20,286
Ready? One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

403
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:25,725
- Sorry.
- No, you can't.

404
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:28,045
- Claire!
- Aaron!

405
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:30,165
- May I?
- Do you mind?

406
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:32,885
No.

407
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:47,764
It's my favorite club.

408
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:51,844
- Mine too.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.

409
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:54,484
How do you get the petrol coupons to go
zipping up and down to London?

410
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:58,324
Secret, darling.
I know a chap.

411
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:01,644
- No, but how?
- It's not what you think.

412
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:03,643
Do you have to know everything?

413
00:35:03,804 --> 00:35:06,723
I don't know why you want me.
Let's get married before it stops.

414
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:10,643
- Tom, don't.
- I love you!

415
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:13,443
They say you shouldn't fall in love
in a war. You never know what's coming.

416
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:19,323
I love you.
I really love you.

417
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:39,762
No cottage.

418
00:35:39,923 --> 00:35:42,522
- Is that code, darling?
- Yes.

419
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,801
- I want to see where you sleep.
- Landlady has rules.

420
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:48,921
So have I.
Hester's at home.

421
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,921
Oh.

422
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,041
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
Promise.

423
00:35:56,882 --> 00:35:58,721
Shh. Shh.

424
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:12,880
Sleep with her?

425
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,280
I'll take that as a yes.

426
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,200
And then you quarreled?

427
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:23,640
Quarreled? No.

428
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,759
Claire? Darling?

429
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,239
Sorry, darling.

430
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,239
Go back to sleep.

431
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,439
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking through your things.

432
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,239
No photographs?

433
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,838
You've never given me
a photograph.

434
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,358
You're all secrets,
aren’t you?

435
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,958
I've no secrets from you.
Please come back to bed.

436
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:09,038
What's this? What's the
entscheidungs problem when it's at home?

437
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:11,317
That's just something
I was working on at Cambridge.

438
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:14,077
It's a-- It's a theoretical
machine that--

439
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:18,597
- Theoretical. So it doesn't exist?
- Please, come back to bed.

440
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:22,477
Well, this will do.
I want something of yours to keep.

441
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:24,557
Give it back.

442
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:28,917
- Why?
- Because it means nothing
to you and a lot to me.

443
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:32,156
- Aren't I clever enough, darling?
- Please, Claire!

444
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:35,076
No!

445
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:37,276
Give it back.
Give it back.

446
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,636
It's not funny, Claire!

447
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:02,235
Claire, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

448
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:05,075
I'm really, really sorry.

449
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:08,115
Claire--

450
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:10,875
She moved on.

451
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:13,834
Why won’t you answer my letters?

452
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:20,914
Are you seeing someone else?

453
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:23,834
I'm always seeing someone else.

454
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,834
Yes.

455
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,634
She moved on.

456
00:38:33,954 --> 00:38:36,153
Not right, Mr Jericho.

457
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,433
Can't quite put my finger on it...

458
00:38:40,594 --> 00:38:44,713
but definitely not right.

459
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:55,232
Were you surprised when they told you
that Admiral Doenitz...

460
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:57,432
had changed the German Navy
weather code?

461
00:38:57,593 --> 00:39:00,152
Any bells go off?

462
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:02,192
Germans were always nervous
about Enigma.

463
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:05,232
Well, the Germans are supposed to think
that Enigma's an unbreakable system...

464
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:08,432
because it would take thousands of years
to go through every setting...

465
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:11,832
to find the one that turns
the code back into the plain text.

466
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:16,072
Next day, it's different again. Using
human beings, Enigma is safe forever...

467
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:19,191
but we don't use
human beings for that.

468
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,151
Do we...

469
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:26,111
Mr Jericho?

470
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:28,991
- No.
- No.

471
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:31,631
And that is the secret
inside the secret.

472
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:34,911
All they know thus far is that the weather
code opened a crack in the system...

473
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:37,830
because somebody told them.

474
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:44,430
But what if somebody tells them
just how we do do it?

475
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:49,070
Your thinking machine.
Clackety- clack, day and night.

476
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:52,030
Programmed with a menu,
thanks to your big brain...

477
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:54,670
that reduces the odds
to just a few million to one...

478
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:57,030
till it locks on to
the winning combination.

479
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,189
There goes the war.

480
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,989
Oh.

481
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,909
I've got a little list.

482
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,189
You're on it.

483
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,509
Communists, foreign nationals...

484
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:20,348
geniuses just this side
of barking mad.

485
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:22,428
Altogether, a security nightmare.

486
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:26,828
But of all these names, Mr Jericho,
you are the only one...

487
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:32,388
who got himself fucked into
a nervous breakdown by a missing blonde.

488
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:34,988
You live quietly from now on.

489
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:44,467
Where does one pee around here?

490
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:46,867
To the right.

491
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:23,465
Good night, Mrs Armstrong.

492
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:40,025
Talk to me!
What do you want to know?

493
00:41:41,185 --> 00:41:43,624
Do you want to know about Shark?
Do you want to know about Shark?

494
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:47,304
Any secret. Ask me.
Ask me! I'll tell you!

495
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:51,264
Poor you. I really got
under your skin, didn't I?

496
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,944
Good morning.

497
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,143
- Good morning.
- You look tired, sir.

498
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:08,143
Morning!

499
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:17,583
- Have you heard the latest?
- No.

500
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,863
Utility knickers--
one Yank, and they're off.

501
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:23,103
Naughty, naughty.

502
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:31,382
- Came through the door for you.
- If there is some other way

503
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:34,182
To prove that I love you

504
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:38,822
I swear I don't know how

505
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,861
Thank you for your note.

506
00:42:56,022 --> 00:43:00,381
I take it it's about Claire.
Have you heard anything?

507
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:03,101
She hasn't turned up,
if that's what you mean.

508
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:06,821
But you’ve got something.

509
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:08,940
I don't know why I'm doing this.

510
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:22,980
ADU is the call sign
of Nachtrichten, Regiment 537...

511
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:25,700
a motorized German
Army signals unit based...

512
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,900
in the Ukraine.

513
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,939
Its messages are encoded in the standard
cipher for the Russian campaign.

514
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,979
- We call it Kestrel.
- Kestrel.

515
00:43:57,019 --> 00:43:59,058
Seven messages
with the call sign ADU...

516
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,778
were intercepted
in March and April...

517
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:06,338
not counting the last four
on April the 17th, which you found.

518
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:10,378
I've written down the dates
and times of interception.

519
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:22,537
A spy doesn't steal the enemy's signals.
And anyway, they were never de--

520
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:26,537
They were never decoded. Why would
she steal four messages she can't read?

521
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,737
She must have stolen them
to read them.

522
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,857
She stole them to read them.
But there's no way she could have.

523
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,976
- Why not?
- She couldn't. It just--

524
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,776
Just take my word for it.

525
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:41,336
God preserve me.
Another one.

526
00:44:41,497 --> 00:44:44,376
I seem to move, Mr Jericho,
in an endless round...

527
00:44:44,537 --> 00:44:47,376
from one patronizing male
to another...

528
00:44:47,537 --> 00:44:50,416
forever being told what I am
and what I am not allowed to know.

529
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:52,536
Well, that ends here.

530
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,015
So, what would she need
to read them?

531
00:44:57,176 --> 00:45:00,255
I'm sorry.
You can't ask me that.

532
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:03,855
But you can ask me to sneak into the Index
Room and risk getting hung up by my thumbs.

533
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:11,375
Cheerio, then.

534
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:13,895
Oh, Chr-- Miss Wallace.

535
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,654
Miss Wallace!

536
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:20,574
She'd need--
She'd need a Typex machine.

537
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:25,454
Every day, our Typex machines
have to be set...

538
00:45:25,615 --> 00:45:27,654
the same way the Germans
set their Enigmas.

539
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:30,894
Otherwise, you just get
nonsense from nonsense.

540
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:35,254
And working out each day's settings
is the hard part.

541
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:37,853
That's where
the code breakers come in.

542
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:42,933
- How?
- Well, you-- you need a crib.

543
00:45:43,094 --> 00:45:45,893
Suppose that gravestone was in code.

544
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:49,853
If I knew who was buried here, more
or less, I'd know what the code meant.

545
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,573
That's a crib.

546
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:57,053
And when you've set the machine,
you type in the coded message.

547
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,852
If it comes out nonsense,
the settings are wrong.

548
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:02,092
If it comes out
"Mary Jane Hawkins"...

549
00:46:02,253 --> 00:46:04,092
you've broken Enigma for that day.

550
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:09,852
Why would Claire get hold of the
Kestrel settings for April the 17th?

551
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:12,972
She couldn't have,
unless she had help.

552
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:16,612
Kestrel would be filed in Hut 6.

553
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,891
It’s your hut.

554
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:23,051
So now I'm a traitor too.

555
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:28,171
Well, maybe she got access
to one of the Typex machines from you.

556
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:31,491
Typex girls work around the clock.

557
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:33,171
Sorry.

558
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:36,571
Stuck.

559
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:40,530
Look.

560
00:46:40,691 --> 00:46:43,770
The first seven ADUs were decoded.

561
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:46,290
Now, what happens
to decoded messages?

562
00:46:46,451 --> 00:46:50,050
They get written into the German book.
That's Claire's job.

563
00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:52,090
Then what?

564
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:55,210
Well, then they get filed with
everything else in the main registry.

565
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:59,130
- Ever been in there?
- Once or twice to check some--

566
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,409
No. No, no, no, no.

567
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,489
Oh, dear, would you like some tea?

568
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,089
- Reference or loan?
- Reference.

569
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,009
- Section?
- Hut 6. Control.

570
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:23,808
- What are they?
- Kestrel intercepts, March and April.

571
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:36,368
- He's been a dark horse, hasn't he?
- Hmm. Surprise a minute.

572
00:47:36,529 --> 00:47:39,088
But there are complications.

573
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,488
Sorry to have been so long.

574
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:44,087
I've never come across this before.

575
00:47:45,928 --> 00:47:48,727
- The file was empty?
- There was a typewritten note...

576
00:47:48,888 --> 00:47:50,487
dated April the 17th...

577
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:53,207
referring all inquiries
to the Office of the Director General.

578
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:57,647
And that night, four final ADU
messages got in under the wire...

579
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,247
never deciphered, never filed...

580
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:02,607
taken home by Claire and hidden.

581
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,046
Who is the Director General?

582
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,366
Chief of the Special
Intelligence Service.

583
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:13,126
And he gets his orders straight
from the prime minister.

584
00:48:14,807 --> 00:48:16,686
We're stuck again.

585
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:19,646
Maybe. Maybe not.

586
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:26,046
I've got the hang
of this detective work.

587
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:35,885
You're out of bounds!

588
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:40,685
- Mr Mermagen.
- What are you doing?

589
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:45,085
Can you help me?

590
00:48:45,245 --> 00:48:48,444
Machine Room needs the Kestrel settings
for the last couple of weeks.

591
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:52,124
They've found a batch of intercepts
fallen behind a desk.

592
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:55,884
- They've done what?
- I know.

593
00:48:56,045 --> 00:49:00,164
But please don't tell.
It was actually a friend of mine.

594
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:04,884
Ah, you girls.

595
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:15,083
You know, I should really
report you for this...

596
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,923
but--

597
00:49:18,644 --> 00:49:21,683
One good turn
deserves another, hmm?

598
00:49:21,844 --> 00:49:25,603
Why, Mr Mermagen.

599
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:31,362
What will your wife say?

600
00:49:31,523 --> 00:49:35,682
The Kestrel settings
for the whole of March and April.

601
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:37,602
Christ.

602
00:49:37,763 --> 00:49:41,802
So, at least there's still a chance we can
read the ones you found in Claire's bedroom.

603
00:49:41,963 --> 00:49:43,882
- I've burnt them.
- You what?

604
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:46,042
Hello, Tom.
Mind if we join you?

605
00:49:46,203 --> 00:49:50,002
- You can't m-m-m-mean it.
- Well, of course I mean it.

606
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:53,841
Drowning herself was Virginia Woolf's greatest
contribution to English literature.

607
00:49:54,002 --> 00:49:57,521
- Actually, we were just leaving.
- Waste not, want not.

608
00:49:57,682 --> 00:49:59,521
Whale meat.
Brain food, Tom.

609
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:04,121
- You burned them!
- I had a close call with that lounge lizard Wigram from Special Intelligence.

610
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:08,081
I panicked. But the worst of it is,
I could have read them.

611
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:10,481
- How?
- I didn't need a Typex machine.

612
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:13,120
We've got a real Enigma
in the museum.

613
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:17,680
- Well, when did you find that out?
- Well, I knew. I just-- I just forgot.

614
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,240
You forgot?

615
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:23,080
And you're the genius.

616
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:29,680
You know, I won a newspaper
crossword competition.

617
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:34,120
I beat two men. All three of us
were recruited for Bletchley.

618
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,279
They're cryptanalysts now.

619
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,039
And I'm a glorified file clerk.

620
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,359
'Course, if I'd been a daddy's girl
from some posh finishing school--

621
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,919
God, look, it's time
to go back on shift.

622
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,679
- You?
- Not for a bit.

623
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,079
Right.

624
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:55,838
Did she ever say anything about me?

625
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,918
Well, she must like you.

626
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:05,918
The way she talks about the others--

627
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,238
A bus load, you said?

628
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,878
The Romilly effect.

629
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,598
One look, and they're "Romillied. "

630
00:51:16,758 --> 00:51:20,277
Who was she seeing?
I only mean it might be a way forward.

631
00:51:20,438 --> 00:51:23,917
- I know what you think about me.
- No, you don't.

632
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,637
Well, I feel like an idiot.

633
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:32,277
And you aren't the one standing here with
the Kestrel settings stuffed into your knickers.

634
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:38,796
Look, I don't know
who she was seeing...

635
00:51:38,957 --> 00:51:43,476
and I really think
we'd better call this a day.

636
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:45,476
Don’t you?

637
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:53,276
Bye, then.

638
00:51:54,637 --> 00:51:56,756
Miss Wallace.

639
00:51:59,556 --> 00:52:02,035
I haven't been lookin'
to the right or left...

640
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:07,115
so there's something
I didn't see clearly.

641
00:52:07,276 --> 00:52:10,115
What's that?

642
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:12,435
That you’re a remarkable--

643
00:52:15,076 --> 00:52:17,475
I think you’re simply wonderful.

644
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:33,914
Tom, nice of you to turn up.

645
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:37,714
- Look, I don't known what Skynner's been saying.
- Shut the door.

646
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:44,193
He wants you out.

647
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:47,953
"Send him back to Cambridge,
and this time make the bugger walk. "

648
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:50,193
I got you the rail pass.

649
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:53,313
- Not now!
- No, you can't do that, Guy. Tell them
you want to give me a couple of days.

650
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,913
- Why?
- To see if I can find a way back into Shark.

651
00:52:56,074 --> 00:52:58,833
Tom, it was you that announced
that it couldn't be done in four days.

652
00:52:58,993 --> 00:53:01,392
It was you that made Skynner look
a fool in front of his clients.

653
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:05,792
Now you want me to go back and
tell him-- Piss off, for God's sake!

654
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:10,232
Sorry, Guy. Hello, Thomas.
You'd better come and hear this.

655
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:12,712
Two long signals from U-boat
headquarters in the last 12 hours.

656
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:15,832
One just before midnight,
one just after. Rebroadcast twice.

657
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:19,952
- Then nothing. U-boat fleet is on radio silence.
- Christ.

658
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:23,431
They're on battle stations.

659
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:26,671
Say 12 U-boats 20 miles apart...

660
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,031
possibly two lines,
possibly three.

661
00:53:29,192 --> 00:53:32,871
An ambush covering
hundreds of miles of ocean.

662
00:53:33,032 --> 00:53:36,111
And this time,
we don't know where.

663
00:53:36,272 --> 00:53:39,511
And one golden rule--
absolute radio silence.

664
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:42,151
- And wh-- wh--
- What then?

665
00:53:42,311 --> 00:53:47,830
Either the convoy is lucky and misses
the ambush, or it isn't lucky.

666
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,590
And the first U-boat to make contact
with the convoy breaks radio silence.

667
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,950
- How?
- Minimally, using the short signal book.

668
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,830
It compresses the necessary information
to a few letters--

669
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:00,630
sighting of convoy,
position, course and speed.

670
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:04,190
That's repeated every two hours. As it's
picked up by the other U-boats in the line...

671
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:07,749
they start to converge on the convoy
and send a contact signal in their turn.

672
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,389
Contact signal.

673
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:14,109
They'll shadow the convoy till nightfall.
They prefer to attack in the dark.

674
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:20,429
We haven't got as much time as we'd thought.
I'd say, a day, a day and a half at the outside.

675
00:54:23,669 --> 00:54:28,588
- Mary Jane Hawkins.
- The oracle has spoken.

676
00:54:28,749 --> 00:54:33,308
They changed the weather code, but they
didn't change the short signal code book.

677
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:37,148
It's our way back into Shark,
so long as the U-boats find our convoy.

678
00:54:39,629 --> 00:54:41,468
Don’t you see?
It's our convoy.

679
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:44,468
We know what the U-boats are sending.
It's the crib that we've been looking for.

680
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:47,307
- Would you get enough material?
- How many signals do you need?

681
00:54:47,468 --> 00:54:50,267
One group of letters
for the convoy sighted...

682
00:54:50,428 --> 00:54:53,067
two groups for grid reference, one group
for course, one group for speed.

683
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:55,947
Five groups of letters
per contact signal every two hours.

684
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:59,787
Shadowing the convoy for maybe 10 hours,
12-- that's 25 groups of letters.

685
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:02,347
And how many U-boats joining in?
Eight, ten?

686
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:06,067
Each one a contact signal
every two hours.

687
00:55:06,227 --> 00:55:09,546
My God, he's right.
He's found us a crib.

688
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:14,306
- Brilliant.
- A-A-Appalling.

689
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:17,906
We've never had an operation on this scale. The contact
signals could easily build up to give us a crib...

690
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:21,586
of 100 group of letters and we've got
the short signal code book in the museum.

691
00:55:21,747 --> 00:55:24,186
He's right, Guy.

692
00:55:25,547 --> 00:55:27,706
Where are the keys to the museum?

693
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:32,105
Good Christ, Tom. We have to protect
the convoys, not sacrifice them.

694
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:35,265
You know what it's like out there.

695
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:37,705
The success of this plan
depends on arranging a massacre.

696
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:41,105
No. No, we are not arranging anything.
What happens is going to happen.

697
00:55:41,266 --> 00:55:44,265
But if we can use it to our advantage,
we'll be able to decipher every signal...

698
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:47,145
sent by every U-boat
on the high seas for 24 hours!

699
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:49,905
- Including the weather reports.
- Yeah. We'll have the plain text.

700
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:51,944
We can make a start on reconstructing
the new weather code.

701
00:55:52,105 --> 00:55:56,104
- This puts us back in the fight.
- And there will be many more convoys to protect.

702
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,464
You're back in business,
old thing.

703
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:40,502
Garbled text from Beaumanor.
Somebody get on the blower.

704
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:43,982
Miss Chamberlain, would you?
Get them to check their file copy.

705
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:53,022
Pam, does Beaumanor keep copies
of everything they send us?

706
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:56,341
- Yes. It's all there on file.
- Thank you.

707
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:59,341
Hello. Could I have Beaumanor 392?

708
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:03,621
Miss Wallace!

709
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:18,660
No female visitors upstairs.
That's the rule!

710
00:57:21,261 --> 00:57:23,980
Mr Jericho, wake up.
It's not over.

711
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:26,820
- We need to borrow your Enigma machine.
- Didn’t you hear?

712
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,379
Top copy goes straight to
your people by teleprinter...

713
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:58,698
or by dispatch rider,
depending on priority.

714
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:02,698
The second copy we keep,
in case of garbles.

715
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:05,098
Can we see?

716
00:58:05,259 --> 00:58:08,698
Well, if you want.
There's not much to it.

717
00:58:08,859 --> 00:58:12,698
It's a treat for us, you know, a visit
from head office to the country cousins.

718
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:15,138
It's good of you to say so,
but, um...

719
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:19,058
a fat lot of use we'd be
without your intercepts, Major.

720
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:25,097
We keep them a couple of months,
filed chronologically.

721
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:33,457
These sets are tuned to the
Eastern Front-- Kestrel, Buzzard, Kite.

722
00:58:33,618 --> 00:58:36,457
- And you're intercepting everything?
- Absolutely.

723
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:39,297
Except that time
the other week, of course.

724
00:58:39,457 --> 00:58:41,056
Kestrel, wasn't it?

725
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:46,696
Yes, your Miles Mermagen came
on the blower in a frightful panic.

726
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,696
"No more ADU, thank you very much.
Not now, not ever. "

727
00:58:49,857 --> 00:58:52,416
- What's that about?
- Orders from above.

728
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:55,696
We'd just sent him
four good, clean signals.

729
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:58,536
It was Kay here who handled
our mystery station.

730
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:00,175
Carry on.

731
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:04,375
Yeah, he has a good fist, ADU.
Touch like a concert pianist.

732
00:59:04,536 --> 00:59:06,775
He's still transmitting?

733
00:59:06,936 --> 00:59:11,175
Of course, I don't take him down any
more, but he was awful busy last week.

734
00:59:11,336 --> 00:59:12,575
Oh, excuse me, sir.

735
00:59:16,496 --> 00:59:19,295
What was it you said
you did again, Mr--

736
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:21,295
- Jericho.
- Jericho.

737
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:24,934
Can't say, I'm afraid.
Catch you up.

738
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:33,254
- Major, how many machines did you say you have here?
- We have 48 here.

739
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:13,892
Excuse me.

740
01:00:18,493 --> 01:00:21,132
He's on now,
if you’re interested, sir.

741
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:00,570
Thank you.

742
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:03,690
I don't mean
to bother you, sir...

743
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:05,890
but it is important,
isn't it?

744
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,889
I know I shouldn't ask.
I mean, no one ever tells us.

745
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,329
You are making sense of it?
It is important?

746
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,329
Yes.

747
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:18,289
This is our only war, you see,
in here-- beep, beep, bloody beep.

748
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,729
And it's always nonsense,
nonsense, nonsense.

749
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:24,209
Yes, we are
making sense of it...

750
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,009
and it is important.

751
01:01:30,409 --> 01:01:33,568
Eleven ADU signals
and launchings.

752
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:41,968
That's the car.
Man, woman, two-seater roadster.

753
01:01:54,368 --> 01:01:56,207
Invite him to stop, shall we?

754
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,166
Take him, man! Take him!

755
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:45,525
Mr Jericho, stop! Stop! Stop!

756
01:02:46,646 --> 01:02:48,245
Look out!

757
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:01,884
Shit.

758
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:06,964
Bravo, Mr Jericho.

759
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:09,684
Reckon, given the circumstances,
Miss Wallace...

760
01:03:09,805 --> 01:03:11,844
we might now risk
first names.

761
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:16,883
Hester.

762
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:18,843
Tom.

763
01:03:22,444 --> 01:03:26,043
This might be good.
It looks deserted enough.

764
01:03:26,204 --> 01:03:28,043
Well spotted.

765
01:03:38,803 --> 01:03:40,402
Bliss.

766
01:03:43,203 --> 01:03:45,802
- What would they do to us if they knew?
- Feed us to the dogs.

767
01:03:45,963 --> 01:03:48,322
Charming.

768
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:56,002
Right.

769
01:03:56,162 --> 01:03:59,241
March and April
Beaumanor log sheets...

770
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,281
and the intercepts
from March 28th...

771
01:04:02,442 --> 01:04:07,601
April 3rd, April 9th,
15th, 16th, 17th...

772
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:11,681
and Kestrel settings--
last one first.

773
01:04:11,842 --> 01:04:14,321
Might tell us
why Claire disappeared.

774
01:04:14,482 --> 01:04:17,161
Right. April 17, rotor order.

775
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,560
3- 5-4.

776
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:23,040
3- 5-4.

777
01:04:25,641 --> 01:04:28,760
R- X-O.

778
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:34,640
- Plug board settings.
- A-O-E-M.

779
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,519
The current passes
from the keyboard...

780
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,639
to the lamps by way
of the rotors and the plugs.

781
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,319
And every time you press a key,
it changes the path of the current.

782
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,959
Press the same key ten times, it comes out
ten different ways on the lamp board.

783
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,599
You never know which letters
will light up. Simply brilliant.

784
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:06,318
Message key X-A-T.

785
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:12,638
- Ready?
- Ready.

786
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:16,438
- "Y. "
- "K. "

787
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:19,478
- "E. "
- "A. "

788
01:05:19,638 --> 01:05:21,797
"W. "

789
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:23,317
"C. "

790
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,957
- "U. "
- Zed.

791
01:05:27,718 --> 01:05:30,277
"M. "

792
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:32,717
"V. "

793
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:39,397
- "Q. "
- "X. "

794
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:45,596
It's not right, is it?
This isn't German.

795
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:47,836
Keep going. Sometimes the operator
pads out with nonsense.

796
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:02,196
Keep going.

797
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:05,235
- Um, "K. "
- Zed.

798
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,795
- "E. "
- "R. "

799
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:12,475
- "O. "
- "A. "

800
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:16,275
- "F. "
- "D. "

801
01:06:17,676 --> 01:06:21,355
Isn't German.
Come on, genius!

802
01:06:31,475 --> 01:06:33,554
I'm sorry. It's double coded,
or the settings must be wrong.

803
01:06:33,715 --> 01:06:35,274
It's all been for nothing.

804
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:21,752
I'm afraid I have to ask you
to hurry up.

805
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,349
Search the barn.

806
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:24,549
This is Mr Leveret.
Detective Inspector Leveret.

807
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:28,429
He wants to know what you've been up to.
But first things first.

808
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:47,148
You've been here before?

809
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:52,468
And you?

810
01:08:57,268 --> 01:08:59,827
Line up in the street
and search the area.

811
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:04,227
Have a look at this, sir.
It's down there.

812
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:07,067
- Right, sir.
- There?

813
01:09:07,228 --> 01:09:09,587
Drag the river.

814
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:23,226
Please talk to me! What do you want to
know? I'll tell you anything you want.

815
01:09:25,747 --> 01:09:28,666
Give me your hand.

816
01:09:30,187 --> 01:09:33,386
Do you wanna know about Shark?
Any secret. Ask me!

817
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:38,345
Come this way.

818
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:42,865
I've got something to show you.
Get your notebook out.

819
01:09:45,786 --> 01:09:47,665
Miss Wallace first.

820
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:55,625
I am showing the witness
one ladies' coat, colour grey...

821
01:09:55,785 --> 01:09:58,144
trimmed with black velvet.

822
01:09:58,305 --> 01:10:02,144
Label: Hunters, Burlington Arcade.

823
01:10:03,505 --> 01:10:08,984
- And the witness responded--
- Yes. It's hers.

824
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:11,544
Yes.

825
01:10:13,745 --> 01:10:17,984
Next, one ladies' shoe...

826
01:10:18,144 --> 01:10:20,423
black high heel.

827
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,863
Uh, heel snapped off.

828
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:26,783
And the witness responded--

829
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:30,983
Yes.

830
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:34,543
It's an old quarry.

831
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,983
They built the town
with what they dug out.

832
01:10:37,143 --> 01:10:40,462
That makes sense,
making one hole out of another.

833
01:10:40,623 --> 01:10:45,022
- How deep is it?
- Sixty, seventy foot in the middle.

834
01:10:48,023 --> 01:10:49,862
Christ, we'll need a submarine.

835
01:10:55,063 --> 01:10:57,542
I would very much like
to arrest you...

836
01:10:57,703 --> 01:11:00,062
but we don't have a body.

837
01:11:02,142 --> 01:11:05,181
It's a quarter to 8:00.
Mr Leveret will take you back.

838
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:07,741
I believe your day
is just beginning.

839
01:11:19,102 --> 01:11:21,581
Chaps.

840
01:11:24,021 --> 01:11:28,220
Easy, everyone.
Just stopped by to wish you luck.

841
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:32,220
I'm sure you’re all aware,
as I am, what's at stake here.

842
01:11:32,381 --> 01:11:35,940
I don't think I'm exaggerating
when I say...

843
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:38,940
this could be one of
the decisive nights of the war.

844
01:11:39,101 --> 01:11:41,660
- So shut up, then.
- A mighty battle.

845
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,739
Probably...

846
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,939
the greatest convoy battle
of all time is about to start.

847
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,579
Three hours ago,
convoys HX 229A...

848
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:53,579
229 and SC 122...

849
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:57,179
had entered the presumed
operational area...

850
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,059
of the U-boat packs.

851
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,859
Now, in our long island history...

852
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:06,258
we have picked up the gauntlet
more than a few times.

853
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:08,178
Shakespeare coming up.

854
01:12:08,339 --> 01:12:13,458
"Out of this nettle, danger,
may we pluck this flower, safety. "

855
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:20,298
So, gentlemen, go to it.

856
01:12:39,498 --> 01:12:41,737
Come and dance.
Boop- boop

857
01:12:43,298 --> 01:12:44,657
Come on. Come and dance.

858
01:12:45,937 --> 01:12:48,176
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can. It's easy.

859
01:12:50,057 --> 01:12:52,816
- No, really, you do it.
- Right, left.

860
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:55,336
Left, left.

861
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:58,056
Ah! You're getting the hang of it.

862
01:13:16,136 --> 01:13:18,175
C- Can someone remind me?

863
01:13:18,336 --> 01:13:22,855
A- Are w-we hoping for the U-boats
to find the convoys, o-o-or not?

864
01:13:23,016 --> 01:13:25,175
- Not.
- I am.

865
01:13:25,336 --> 01:13:29,335
- Yes, well, you would, Baxter.
- Y-You'd sacrifice o-o-our--

866
01:13:29,495 --> 01:13:33,134
Sacrifice a convoy
to get back into Shark? Of course.

867
01:13:33,295 --> 01:13:36,934
How many men has Stalin had
to sacrifice so far? Five million?

868
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:39,334
It's called the greater good.

869
01:13:39,495 --> 01:13:43,614
Spoken, of course,
by someone who doesn't happen to be
in the North Atlantic at the moment.

870
01:13:43,775 --> 01:13:48,574
You can only fight your own war.
What do you think, Tom?

871
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:52,693
About what?

872
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:17,012
So, Claire,
what were you doing?

873
01:14:17,173 --> 01:14:19,892
What were you hiding?

874
01:14:44,732 --> 01:14:46,531
Right.

875
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:49,251
Start at the beginning.

876
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,611
Kestrel settings, March.

877
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,250
Atlantic time
is two hours behind.

878
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:07,530
It's still dark.

879
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,409
Here, mate,
I got a lighter.

880
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,489
Thanks.

881
01:16:38,486 --> 01:16:41,325
"Urgent. "

882
01:16:41,486 --> 01:16:43,725
Mary Jane Hawkins.

883
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:45,965
It is German.

884
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:26,203
Signal 7-3-6-9-K-C-S.

885
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:29,003
We're in business.

886
01:17:29,164 --> 01:17:30,763
Direction finders have a fix.

887
01:17:32,924 --> 01:17:36,043
Scarborough, 2-5-9 degrees.

888
01:17:39,364 --> 01:17:43,083
Witt, 2-4-6, 30 degrees.

889
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:50,322
Flower down, 2-6-8 degrees.

890
01:17:54,363 --> 01:17:59,242
There she is--
37.5, 49.5.

891
01:17:59,403 --> 01:18:02,722
She's shadowing convoy HX 229.

892
01:18:02,882 --> 01:18:05,361
No air cover. Sitting ducks.

893
01:18:05,522 --> 01:18:07,561
Grid square?

894
01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:13,121
B- D-1491.

895
01:18:13,282 --> 01:18:15,521
- Convoy course?
- Seventy degrees.

896
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:17,641
- Convoy speed.
- Ten knots.

897
01:18:37,961 --> 01:18:41,040
- From the code book, we have C-K-S-A for convoy sighted.
- First message?

898
01:18:41,201 --> 01:18:44,560
K- A-F-B-N-W-Zed-Jacob
for position.

899
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,759
Q- K-D-X for course, Q-R-Zed-A for speed.
That's five four-letter groups.

900
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:53,759
Message setting, B-H-B.

901
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,079
"A- V, V-K, A-K. "

902
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,798
Check.

903
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,278
Yeah, me too.

904
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:20,198
- "M-S, S-M. "
- Check.

905
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:23,198
Two loops. Confirmed?

906
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:25,718
And no clashes.

907
01:19:25,879 --> 01:19:27,798
10:04.

908
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:29,637
One down.

909
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,797
Now the wolves
will be gathering.

910
01:19:56,477 --> 01:19:59,036
Still nonsense. Why?

911
01:19:59,157 --> 01:20:04,396
Can you fix B-D-1611?
Convoy speed and direction same.

912
01:20:04,557 --> 01:20:08,636
New position:
K- A-F-V, N-C-L-A.

913
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:11,635
Skynner's offered a bottle of Scotch
to the first man to come up with a menu.

914
01:20:11,796 --> 01:20:14,955
- Does he know I'm still here?
- He didn't ask.

915
01:20:15,116 --> 01:20:17,195
Oh, Puck, there's a message
left for you at the switchboard.

916
01:20:17,356 --> 01:20:20,275
It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.

917
01:20:20,436 --> 01:20:23,515
There's no name,
and I'm not your social secretary.

918
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:26,795
- Message key: R-M-U.
- Sorry, Guy.

919
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:29,795
How much more material
do you need?

920
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:34,194
We've got 9 signals.
Another 20, 25 would be better.

921
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:37,194
Suppose it starts
before you have them.

922
01:20:45,995 --> 01:20:48,714
Naval grid square B-D-1386.

923
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:52,234
Course: 70 degrees.
Speed of convoy: 10 knots.

924
01:20:56,354 --> 01:20:59,793
I'm pretty sure there's enough
for a stab at a menu. Let's try it.

925
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:03,913
- You have 17 contacts, Mr Jericho.
- It's not enough.

926
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:06,073
Well, why the hell not?

927
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:10,993
When I'm done, we'll be looking
for a needle in a haystack...

928
01:21:11,154 --> 01:21:14,913
but if we stop now it'll be
a hundred thousand haystacks.

929
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:19,072
You know that.

930
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:23,552
Full moon.
Ten U-boats, somewhere.

931
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:27,712
Thirty- seven merchants, five escorts,
one of which has lost contact with the convoy.

932
01:21:27,873 --> 01:21:31,032
No rescue ship
and no air cover.

933
01:21:31,193 --> 01:21:33,232
Eighteen.

934
01:21:33,392 --> 01:21:36,551
- Flower down, 2-6-8 degrees.
- It's what you might call a bitch.

935
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,190
- Twenty-three.
- Not enough.

936
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:26,549
- What have you got?
- I need one more link.

937
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,989
I can't see it.

938
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:34,709
Names. They're names.

939
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:37,549
- You?
- No.

940
01:22:37,709 --> 01:22:40,948
Getting a very bad feeling now.

941
01:22:42,389 --> 01:22:44,668
Polish names.

942
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:55,028
- There.
- Yes.

943
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:06,827
- Menu.
- Let's hope to God it works.

944
01:23:12,788 --> 01:23:16,107
It's started. Bastards.

945
01:23:41,706 --> 01:23:44,825
Don’t you have homes to go to?

946
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:08,064
- How's it going?
- Four hits so far.

947
01:24:08,225 --> 01:24:10,504
Probably 300 men lost.

948
01:24:10,665 --> 01:24:14,664
A Dutch cargo and a Norwegian freighter
went straight to the bottom.

949
01:24:14,825 --> 01:24:17,544
And an American liberty ship's
on fire.

950
01:24:17,705 --> 01:24:21,024
Half the crew are drowning.
The other half are trying to save them.

951
01:24:24,904 --> 01:24:28,783
Tom. Unfinished business.

952
01:24:31,224 --> 01:24:33,703
Congratulations.

953
01:24:33,864 --> 01:24:36,423
It's a half bottle,
as it turns out.

954
01:24:37,584 --> 01:24:40,023
Typical Skynner.

955
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:42,743
That should go back.

956
01:24:42,904 --> 01:24:44,823
Where's the museum key?

957
01:24:44,983 --> 01:24:47,422
Oh, sorry, Guy.
I've still got it.

958
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,902
Tsk, tsk.
Security around here.

959
01:24:51,063 --> 01:24:53,942
Then get off home, old thing.

960
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:57,262
- Haven't you got a girl waiting for you?
- She's dead.

961
01:25:45,861 --> 01:25:47,780
Tom.

962
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:53,139
Oh, my God. Come on.

963
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,859
- What?
- Come on.

964
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,699
It's Polish.

965
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,699
Polish names, all of them.

966
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:02,819
The Germans
found a mass grave.

967
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:06,859
Look, doesn't it say
4, 000 corpses?

968
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:13,538
"Polish officers buried
in the forest at Katyn in 1940...

969
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:16,538
"during the Soviet occupation.

970
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:18,738
Shot in the back of the head. "

971
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:21,018
Murdered by the Russians.

972
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,618
By our Russian allies.

973
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:26,538
They were comrades-in-arms
against the Nazis.

974
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:29,618
My God.

975
01:26:29,778 --> 01:26:33,057
That's why the file was empty--
on the orders of Secret Intelligence.

976
01:26:33,218 --> 01:26:37,977
And that's why Beaumanor was ordered
to stop intercepting the signals.

977
01:26:38,138 --> 01:26:40,057
It was too big a secret.

978
01:26:40,218 --> 01:26:43,577
Just knowing that
can get you killed.

979
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:47,337
And Claire discovered it.

980
01:26:47,498 --> 01:26:50,257
Copied it into the German book,
and she had to tell...

981
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,817
someone.

982
01:26:58,657 --> 01:27:01,096
- Adam Pukowski.
- What?

983
01:27:01,257 --> 01:27:02,856
Missing in action.

984
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:05,816
Kid brother of Jozef Pukowski.

985
01:27:05,977 --> 01:27:07,456
Claire stole those intercepts
for Puck...

986
01:27:07,617 --> 01:27:10,896
because he was looking
for his brother's name.

987
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:14,016
- Puck!
- Wait! Please!

988
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,895
This Puck killed her. Why?

989
01:27:17,056 --> 01:27:21,815
Because he had a secret, too,
and she could've given him away.

990
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:24,095
- What secret?
- I can't tell you that!

991
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:25,975
Tom!

992
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:52,134
Hello. Could you get me
London Adelphi 4-2-4-3, please?

993
01:27:52,295 --> 01:27:54,854
I'm sorry. That number
is not in service.

994
01:27:58,854 --> 01:28:02,813
What the hell is this about, you and
some skirt waltzing around Beaumanor?

995
01:28:02,974 --> 01:28:06,333
Leonard, unless you're asking me
to dance, let go of my arm!

996
01:28:06,494 --> 01:28:10,653
I should've cooked your goose when you made
a fool of yourself over that blonde...

997
01:28:14,374 --> 01:28:16,373
who fucked half the park.

998
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:18,252
What?

999
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:10,890
Stand away! Stand away!

1000
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:18,450
What the bloody hell
do you think you’re doing?

1001
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:23,969
He's two carriages up.
Snug as a bug in a rug.

1002
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:26,649
Morning, sir.

1003
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,329
You knew?

1004
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:43,728
About Pukowski?

1005
01:29:43,889 --> 01:29:46,848
We had no proof,
but when Miss Romilly went missing--

1006
01:29:47,009 --> 01:29:51,288
- Puck and Claire were having an--
- Were seeing each other, as you like to put it.

1007
01:29:51,449 --> 01:29:53,568
Seeing each other's
brains out.

1008
01:29:53,729 --> 01:29:56,928
Jozef Pukowski, who'd been wondering
what could have happened...

1009
01:29:57,089 --> 01:30:00,568
to all those Polish officers who hadn't been
heard from since the first year of the war...

1010
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,568
and Claire Romilly...

1011
01:30:02,728 --> 01:30:07,007
who was reading the Wermacht traffic
from the Eastern Front.

1012
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:10,007
They were made for each other.

1013
01:30:10,168 --> 01:30:13,007
And lo, mass graves.

1014
01:30:13,168 --> 01:30:16,127
Polish uniforms, names.

1015
01:30:16,288 --> 01:30:20,367
- We've been bracing ourselves for the Nazi propaganda.
- Propaganda?

1016
01:30:22,048 --> 01:30:25,487
Four thousand Poles
murdered by Stalin?

1017
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:28,486
It's what Hitler would
give his last ball for.

1018
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:32,686
Think of all those Polish names
in the U. S. of A.

1019
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:36,526
Think of our convoys
full of American goods...

1020
01:30:36,687 --> 01:30:38,606
some of them
in American ships...

1021
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:42,606
running the U-boat gauntlet so our
supplies can keep Stalin in business.

1022
01:30:42,767 --> 01:30:45,486
- But it's true, isn't it?
- The Katyn massacre?

1023
01:30:45,646 --> 01:30:50,685
Oh, really, do shut up. There's a war
to win, and Stalin's helping us win it.

1024
01:30:50,846 --> 01:30:52,165
And they hate
the Russians, you know.

1025
01:30:52,326 --> 01:30:54,685
They've hated them
for centuries.

1026
01:30:54,846 --> 01:30:57,205
So what's Pukowski
going to do to get back at them?

1027
01:30:57,366 --> 01:31:00,005
Help the enemy. That's what.

1028
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:03,365
His enemy's enemy.

1029
01:31:03,526 --> 01:31:07,965
And he's got a big piece of knowledge
that can help the Germans-- Shark.

1030
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:12,004
- The weather code.
- Claire couldn't have known what he'd do. She wasn't a traitor.

1031
01:31:12,165 --> 01:31:14,404
I'm sure you’re right.

1032
01:31:14,565 --> 01:31:17,844
But then Pukowski heard
that you were coming back.

1033
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:22,564
Jericho, the lover who wouldn't let go,
who'd cracked once before.

1034
01:31:22,725 --> 01:31:26,084
The swot who was invited to the ball,
found Cinderella's slipper...

1035
01:31:26,244 --> 01:31:28,083
and went so crazy
he would've told her anything.

1036
01:31:28,244 --> 01:31:32,283
And you would have, wouldn’t you?
About how we lost Shark.

1037
01:31:32,444 --> 01:31:35,163
And the rumour that there was a mole
in the park, probably in your hut.

1038
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:39,723
How long would it have taken Claire to work out
that the traitor was Puck? About a minute.

1039
01:31:39,884 --> 01:31:41,723
So he killed her.

1040
01:31:46,604 --> 01:31:49,363
One- way to Manchester,
according to the ticket collector.

1041
01:31:49,523 --> 01:31:51,482
Change the watch.

1042
01:31:54,043 --> 01:31:58,882
Well, let's see where
and to whom he will lead us, hmm?

1043
01:32:08,243 --> 01:32:10,442
Train approaching, platform three.

1044
01:32:10,602 --> 01:32:14,201
It's the 3:15 to Manchester.

1045
01:32:17,042 --> 01:32:19,721
How do you get the petrol coupons
to go zipping up and down to London?

1046
01:32:19,882 --> 01:32:24,161
Secret, darling. I know a chap.

1047
01:32:27,602 --> 01:32:32,441
Train standing, platform three.
3:15 for Manchester only.

1048
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,039
Manchester, next stop.

1049
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,399
That's it for you.

1050
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,839
Go home, keep your head down...

1051
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,839
and I might try and forget about you and
your moll breaking the Highway Code...

1052
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,119
and the Official Secrets Act
on the same day.

1053
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,199
Train standing, platform three.

1054
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:13,959
3:15 to Manchester only.

1055
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:19,238
You've been trying to frighten me into keeping
my head down right from the start. Why?

1056
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:22,278
Because somehow
I frighten you. Why?

1057
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:26,198
Because of Claire.
My connection with Claire.

1058
01:33:27,559 --> 01:33:29,398
Be careful now.

1059
01:33:33,998 --> 01:33:36,877
The night you came to my room, you
already had Pukowski in your sights...

1060
01:33:37,038 --> 01:33:39,677
yet you went out of your way
to play the heavy with me.

1061
01:33:39,838 --> 01:33:42,677
And then you were more concerned about
Claire Romilly than you were about Shark.

1062
01:33:42,838 --> 01:33:45,957
- A girl who'd missed her shift? Why?
- Why? She was his girlfriend.

1063
01:33:46,118 --> 01:33:49,437
Oh, no. She was more than that.

1064
01:33:49,598 --> 01:33:53,477
She was working for you.
Claire was your agent.

1065
01:33:53,638 --> 01:33:57,437
She told you everything,
even how I found her shoe.

1066
01:34:01,597 --> 01:34:05,916
As you said, Bletchley was a security nightmare,
so you put a girl in the park to do your dirty work.

1067
01:34:06,077 --> 01:34:08,036
Surely you mean
her patriotic duty.

1068
01:34:08,197 --> 01:34:12,316
Everything that she did, she did because
you told her. You had her fucking for England.

1069
01:34:14,837 --> 01:34:17,716
And then when she got to Pukowski,
it went wrong. She took pity on him...

1070
01:34:17,876 --> 01:34:20,235
and she told him what she was
writing in the German book.

1071
01:34:22,356 --> 01:34:24,315
No wonder you were frightened.

1072
01:34:24,476 --> 01:34:29,155
You'd made a terrible mistake, and your
agent paid for it with her life. Claire.

1073
01:34:30,676 --> 01:34:32,515
He's jumped!

1074
01:34:38,315 --> 01:34:39,994
He's gone!

1075
01:34:44,035 --> 01:34:47,634
Come on! Back it up!
Back the train up!

1076
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,954
What are they doing?

1077
01:35:14,634 --> 01:35:19,873
Sir, please. The station's clear.
Roadblocks are in place.

1078
01:35:20,033 --> 01:35:23,552
- Search the train again.
- He's not on the train!

1079
01:35:23,713 --> 01:35:26,832
- We'll have to let it go.
- Please be patient.

1080
01:35:49,232 --> 01:35:53,231
Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you
at the switchboard. It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.

1081
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:04,830
- Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.

1082
01:36:04,991 --> 01:36:07,350
- To the station, rather fast, please.
- Ma'am.

1083
01:37:24,228 --> 01:37:27,147
You bloody idiot.
This time I can't save you.

1084
01:37:27,307 --> 01:37:29,146
You broke Skynner's cheekbone.

1085
01:37:31,347 --> 01:37:34,146
Tom. Well, weather code is,
uh, c-c-cracking open.

1086
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:36,746
Where's Puck?

1087
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:42,026
- Check our weather report--
- How bad is it?

1088
01:37:42,187 --> 01:37:44,146
It's bad.

1089
01:37:44,307 --> 01:37:47,466
But we are reading Shark,
thanks to you lot.

1090
01:37:50,426 --> 01:37:54,905
- What's this?
- Grid square A-M-2-9. We think it's a garbled signal.

1091
01:37:55,066 --> 01:37:57,625
- Signal to a U-boat?
- Mmm. U-617.

1092
01:37:57,786 --> 01:38:01,065
Ordered out of battle
to proceed immedi--

1093
01:38:01,226 --> 01:38:02,545
Yes?

1094
01:38:02,706 --> 01:38:04,425
Where is this?

1095
01:38:04,586 --> 01:38:09,465
Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where
I'd like to be old. If I'm ever old.

1096
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:14,464
So, it's the real thing.
U- 671, rendezvous in 24 hours.

1097
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:17,864
Our turn to find a sitting duck.

1098
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:19,464
My God.

1099
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,463
- Be careful.
- I will.

1100
01:39:51,341 --> 01:39:52,540
Damn it.

1101
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:14,019
- I'm on the chosen frequency.
- Sir.

1102
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:17,859
- There's probably interference.
- Swing around. I'll fine-tune it.

1103
01:40:18,019 --> 01:40:19,858
Perfect.

1104
01:40:20,019 --> 01:40:22,858
Just in time to bugger up
the whole operation.

1105
01:40:37,938 --> 01:40:41,697
- Do you want to abort?
- Are you serious?

1106
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:12,896
- I didn't kill her.
- I know.

1107
01:41:13,057 --> 01:41:15,616
Do you think
I'm here for that?

1108
01:41:19,736 --> 01:41:23,495
- That's right, my darling.
- They're ready.

1109
01:41:23,656 --> 01:41:26,575
Up you come.

1110
01:41:26,736 --> 01:41:28,575
What about the rest of it?

1111
01:41:28,736 --> 01:41:32,095
The real secret you want to tell the Germans,
about how we really broke the code?

1112
01:41:32,256 --> 01:41:36,095
- About my machines!
- Thomas, Thomas.

1113
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:38,415
- You can have your enemy. Let me have mine.
- No.

1114
01:41:38,576 --> 01:41:40,615
Well, shoot me, then.

1115
01:41:40,775 --> 01:41:44,414
- It's your show, but your man--
- He is not my man.

1116
01:41:44,575 --> 01:41:46,574
Serve it up.

1117
01:41:49,095 --> 01:41:52,894
- Go ahead.
- Tell Auntie Mae the package is ready.

1118
01:42:09,054 --> 01:42:10,533
Dinner's ready.

1119
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:41,452
Bulls eye!

1120
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:28,810
- Run out a couple of yards there.
- You're looking in the wrong place.

1121
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:32,009
Oh, it's Mr Jericho.

1122
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:37,369
Come home again
with his batteries dried out.

1123
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:39,649
You turned out to be
some swot.

1124
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:45,209
- I tip my hat to you.
- She's not there. Didn’t you hear me?

1125
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:48,489
She's moved on.

1126
01:43:50,729 --> 01:43:54,168
The murder scene was like
a pile of clothes left on a beach.

1127
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:56,568
Sometimes it means
somebody's dead.

1128
01:43:56,729 --> 01:43:59,568
Sometimes it means
somebody wanted to disappear.

1129
01:43:59,729 --> 01:44:02,568
Like an agent who'd been
turned by her target.

1130
01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:05,568
It was you
who saw it before I did.

1131
01:44:05,729 --> 01:44:07,688
What makes you think that?

1132
01:44:07,849 --> 01:44:10,728
Pukowski was on the train,
and you were letting him run.

1133
01:44:10,888 --> 01:44:15,727
He knew the secret that could lose us
the war. Remember? The thinking machine.

1134
01:44:15,888 --> 01:44:18,607
You were holding back to see
who he would lead you to.

1135
01:44:18,768 --> 01:44:22,047
Who the hell could it be
to make you take that risk?

1136
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:23,887
Only Claire.

1137
01:44:24,048 --> 01:44:26,287
Well, I was wrong, wasn't I?

1138
01:44:26,448 --> 01:44:28,447
She wasn't with Pukowski.

1139
01:44:28,608 --> 01:44:33,047
She was waiting for him up the line to take
him to her little Scottish hideaway...

1140
01:44:33,207 --> 01:44:36,286
where a couple of runaway lovers
could sit out the rest of the war.

1141
01:44:36,447 --> 01:44:39,206
Do you think I didn't check?

1142
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:43,286
She loved him, and Pukowski brought her
all the way to the brink...

1143
01:44:43,447 --> 01:44:45,606
but then he had to tell her
what she didn't know...

1144
01:44:45,767 --> 01:44:49,446
about the U-boat
coming to pick him up, and why.

1145
01:44:49,607 --> 01:44:51,686
If they got caught,
they'd both hang.

1146
01:44:51,846 --> 01:44:56,125
But there was no going back.
Only forward, to Germany.

1147
01:44:56,286 --> 01:44:58,285
But then,
he didn't know Claire.

1148
01:44:58,446 --> 01:45:01,005
She was no traitor.

1149
01:45:02,646 --> 01:45:05,405
She's out there, somewhere...

1150
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:09,085
like a sword
hanging over your head.

1151
01:45:10,246 --> 01:45:12,205
In different ways,
she fooled us all.

1152
01:45:12,365 --> 01:45:15,404
She was unreadable.

1153
01:45:17,445 --> 01:45:22,804
- Stick to sums.
- I think I've got something! Easy does it!

1154
01:45:22,965 --> 01:45:25,444
What have you got there?

1155
01:45:25,605 --> 01:45:27,284
Steady.

1156
01:45:27,445 --> 01:45:30,084
- We're losing her, lads.
- Do you want it to be her?

1157
01:45:30,245 --> 01:45:32,484
Steady, now.

1158
01:45:33,764 --> 01:45:37,483
False alarm!

1159
01:45:37,644 --> 01:45:40,443
Shut up.

1160
01:45:40,604 --> 01:45:42,963
Keep looking.

1161
01:45:44,204 --> 01:45:46,603
Oh, I will.

1162
01:45:46,764 --> 01:45:48,963
I will.

1163
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,559
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

1164
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:22,479
I was getting worried
about you two.
