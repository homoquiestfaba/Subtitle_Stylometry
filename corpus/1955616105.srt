4
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,547
- Eduardo Deacon.
- Eddie.

5
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:16,220
- Sharing?
- Third battalion. Marine Infantry.

6
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,798
- Postings?
- Three.

7
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:22,191
In 2011 and 2014.

8
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:27,061
- On what dates?
- Three in a row.

9
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:31,796
Sangin district?

10
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,552
- Was it as bad as that was said?
- Yes.

11
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,857
- Physical hemisphere?
- No.

12
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:44,668
- Is there something you do not want?
- I want it all.

13
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:48,940
- Do you want to clean the toilets?
- I will do everything.

14
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:56,295
Your psychological evaluations
have passed, right?

15
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,501
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,546
Listen up.

17
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:09,537
You are now in our database,
so the trip was not in vain.

18
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,887
However, we do not have anything to suit you.

19
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:17,080
- What about the job I came for?
- Was allocated a week ago.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,685
- I saw it on the page two days ago?
- Our system is stopping.

21
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,941
Hear. I have been home for a year now.

22
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:33,439
I have not worked a single day.

23
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,802
My old car falls apart.

24
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:39,079
My wife and child are two states away.

25
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,693
So when I say I want to do
everything, I mean everything.

26
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:45,697
I do this every day and
it will never be easier.

27
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:49,688
Also enter the minimum wage into the profile.

28
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:54,303
- You are a commander and have the right to more.
- I can not wait for that.

29
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,043
I need one now.

30
00:02:57,962 --> 00:03:00,137
Have a good day.

31
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,961
Wait!

32
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,991
Minimum wage. Shorter working hours.

33
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:29,771
- And 40 minutes from here.
- That means nothing.

34
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,521
The job did not arrive because your
evaluations were not intersected.

35
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:38,526
- a typo error
- Safely enough.

36
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,379
Thanks.

37
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,752
- You start tonight.
- Javel.

38
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,376
All-wheel drive and armored

39
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,399
Like last week.

40
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,939
- Charges?
- On the back of the car 2.

42
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:51,349
<i>How did the testify?</i>

43
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,363
As a child.

44
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:17,950
We do not arrive until
about an hour and a half.

45
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,408
Not in this weather.

46
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,852
We are lucky... hello?

47
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,785
The smoke signal.

48
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,388
Check your phone.

49
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,671
No signal.
It must be the storm.

50
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,786
The road is still closed, right?

51
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,902
Jo. Why?

52
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:50,433
We get guests from behind.

53
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,756
It's car 2.
There are cars from behind.

54
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,052
Can we identify them?

55
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,647
Car 3?

56
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:07,306
Car 3, can you hear us?

57
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,392
- The radios are down.
- There is something wrong.

58
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,091
See.

59
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,239
What the hell?

60
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:00,386
Move!

61
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,484
Cover me!

62
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,605
Out of the car!

63
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:18,331
Hear.

64
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:20,627
When I say so you run
against the forest.

65
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:25,290
Do not look back, continue
until you find someone.

66
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,917
Now! Run!

67
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:40,937
We got 9 out of 10.
The goal is gone.

68
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,413
Get cleaned up.

69
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,989
<i>Hello?</i>

70
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:43,055
<i>Eddie?</i>

71
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,853
<i>Where are you?</i>

72
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,599
Hear...

73
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,164
I have found a job.

74
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:54,321
<i>It's great.</i>

75
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,854
<i>- Where?
- Nearby.</i>

76
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:59,885
So I stay here a little bit yet.

77
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,737
<i>Are you okay?</i>

78
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:08,388
<i>Eddie?</i>

79
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:11,285
I'm fine.

80
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:15,034
- They have sent...
- I'm fine.

81
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,783
<i>There are also doctors here...</i>

82
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,535
I'll be back.

83
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,679
I just have to work through something.

84
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:31,014
<i>Silvia is here.
She asks for you all the time.</i>

85
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:35,588
Say that I love her.
Goodbye.

86
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,388
Can I help?

87
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:30,258
Eddie Deacon.
Regarding the job.

88
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,168
The papers?

89
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,316
Thanks.

90
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:45,329
Okay.

91
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,377
You start with $ 15 per
hour and no overtime.

92
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,888
Two breaks in one block.
Understood?

93
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,610
Yes.

94
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,275
Eddie Deacon, this is the
shopping center in Ridgeside.

95
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:03,235
We go to Montclair department store.

96
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:05,782
Great location.

97
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:09,403
Built in 1986, never modernized.

98
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:13,803
Shops with clothes for the whole family.
However, the sports department stops.

99
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,957
The barrel at the end at a time.
Keep it clean

100
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:20,399
Our headquarters.

101
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,067
You will receive a box.
Write it on your free time.

102
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,166
What...?

103
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,107
It does not work.
It must be the weather.

104
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:34,113
Now you have to meet the team.
I'm Vince.

105
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,359
Natholdet and the boss.

106
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,939
The princess here is Mason.

107
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:45,052
He is too good at his job, and
thinks he should sell houses.

108
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,205
- He is here for the sake of wages only.
- Yes, what else?

109
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:54,162
That is why we call him Løn-Mason.

110
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:58,044
You make it the only
one and no one laughs.

111
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,738
He understands that.

112
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,792
- Then what's the matter?
- Touch me and I'll throw up.

113
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,429
Thanks.

114
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:11,626
You're missing something? Water?

115
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:15,967
Cover me for an hour.

116
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,514
Just take a little.

117
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:21,441
It brings us to...

118
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:24,347
... staff department.

119
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,988
In the bed we have Ruby.

120
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:31,321
She has taken double watches for
two days now. So she's allowed.

121
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,891
We have no choice anyway...

122
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,057
Just look.

123
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,368
No fan of thunderstorm, what?

124
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,217
What do you say to lightning?

125
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,000
I only show him it.

126
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,995
30 days and a security course,
you can get your own.

127
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,612
But until then you have to look at me.

128
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:01,284
There is one more.

129
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:05,087
Johnny, how are you?
Where are you?

130
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,674
In the noses.

131
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:12,349
It's Zone D in normal language.

132
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:15,632
It's Johnny Changway, -

133
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:19,904
- but I call him "Levevej",
he lives almost here.

134
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:22,397
In the noses?

135
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,895
Yes, you see...

136
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,621
It looks like a jumper with noses.

137
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:32,395
But otherwise it looks like a gun.

138
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:36,126
Now you will have a tour.

139
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,480
Five zones. A-E.

140
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,273
Montclair, from where we
came from, is Zone A.

141
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:46,381
You should also dress well.

142
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,827
Take it on.

143
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,904
First stop. Zone B.
Shopper road.

144
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:57,240
Here is all shopping.

145
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,073
If you want to buy something delicious
for the wife, then this is the place.

146
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:03,230
Zone C. Madafdelingen.

147
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,921
Everything here kills you.
Take a packed lunch.

148
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,456
Just around the corner you
can see the parking lot.

149
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:12,308
There are the fine gentlemen.

150
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:15,555
- and blinking with the
lights but doing nothing.

151
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:19,177
Zone D. Hover this part.

152
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:23,643
But they compete over here.

153
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:27,343
Once a week it should run so
that the battery does not die, -

154
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,801
So maybe you're lucky, El Fuego.

155
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,186
If it's a real name?

156
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:34,985
And now for the big finale.

157
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:37,908
The second department store.

158
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,547
Which is much better.
Here is amazing.

159
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,129
Here are designer clothes, branded goods -

160
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:47,730
- and coins with one's name on.

161
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:50,675
Our headquarters should be there, -

162
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:54,173
- but Montclair was here first,
so we were sent that way.

163
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:58,891
They replaced us with a barricade

164
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,352
It was actually the tour.
Questions?

165
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,061
- Only one.
- Fire away.

166
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,318
Barricades, power gun,
five guards at night.

167
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:13,905
Not to offend anyone, but you
were forgotten in the 90's.

168
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:18,049
Funny now, cowboy.
You're not from the area, right?

169
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:20,787
What are you really doing here?

170
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:24,625
- I needed a job.
- Javel.

171
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,833
Here comes the next town.

172
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:32,528
The population is 12.640.

173
00:18:32,648 --> 00:18:35,470
Last year there were 48 murders.

174
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:38,304
Herovre is another city.

175
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:42,155
The population is 25,328.

176
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:45,545
- Last year there were 81 murders.
- Myth.

177
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,379
Lots of meth.

178
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:51,788
And a violent gang.

179
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:56,111
So many steal to get food.

180
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,139
You quickly catch the essence.

181
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,421
You are in pretty good shape.

182
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,484
So I have to ask...

183
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,139
The army?

184
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:12,398
I only have a sixth sense.
Were you a sergent?

185
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,124
- Commander.
- Really?

186
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,102
Oh boy. Not bad.

187
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:22,280
I have experience with your kind, -

188
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,491
- and you forget who decides.

189
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:29,401
- No no...
- That's the way it's supposed to sound.

190
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,127
I knew we would be friends.

191
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:35,051
I do not usually touch guys.

192
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,150
Sorry.

193
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:41,060
Let's move on.
You have your radio.

194
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,626
You must always be on channel 4.

195
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:47,034
When you go round,
you always go twice.

196
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:51,052
If you hear or see
something suspicious, -

197
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:54,371
- Then sign it in before doing anything.

198
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:57,672
- So you do not do anything wrong.
- Javel.

199
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:02,726
- Welcome to, soldier.
- Really?

200
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:06,044
You know... good luck.

201
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:49,216
<i>You are not too scared of darkness?</i>

202
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:56,947
Do the cameras still have power?

203
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,093
He also thinks about everything.

204
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,295
We control it.
Give it a moment.

205
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:09,904
We are ready.

206
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,540
- Continue, soldier.
- Received.

207
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,514
Fool.

208
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,415
Okay.

209
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:57,078
The people there is something outside?

210
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:02,009
Can you see someone?

211
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:05,991
It's a little girl.

212
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,861
Repeat. A girl?

213
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:12,286
- She is afraid. I'll shut up.
- No, wait.

214
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,744
No I will not.

215
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:17,345
Quiet now.

216
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,775
A moment.

217
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:26,154
Come on.

218
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:29,813
They are coming!

219
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,885
Calm. There is no one.

220
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,185
Who's coming?

221
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,240
What the hell is it now?
- Do not ask.

222
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:00,199
She is cold.
Bring a blanket.

223
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,751
- Where is her ID?
- She's 12 years old.

224
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,759
So she has no ID.

225
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:10,779
- What do we do?
- Call the police.

226
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:14,167
- She's completely from it.
- Is she stabbed?

227
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,754
I hope that's the problem.

228
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,570
The phones are dead.

229
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,543
Do you have a signal?

230
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,262
No.

231
00:24:28,683 --> 00:24:30,621
Look straight

232
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:33,634
It is at Montclair.

233
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,540
Hello?

234
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:42,549
Hello?

235
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,481
Hello.

236
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,723
Such. Are you okay?

237
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:57,782
I'm looking for my daughter.
She is 11 years old.

238
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:04,742
- We have her. She's okay.
- Thank goodness.

239
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,848
Her father is standing here.
Come down with her.

240
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:10,086
Hold on.

241
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:14,011
She was scared when she arrived.
Someone was after her.

242
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:17,096
Farmand is not always the good one.

243
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:21,020
Is there a problem?

244
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:26,096
- What's her name?
- Jamie.

245
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:30,401
Why did she stop at night?

246
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:34,006
We scolded, then she stopped.

247
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,235
It is her.

248
00:25:37,355 --> 00:25:40,850
She has some scratch marks on her
arm, but otherwise she is okay.

249
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,635
- She ran through the woods.
- What is her date of birth?

250
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:47,666
April 16, 2004.

251
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:50,823
- Eye color?
- They are brown.

252
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,782
Does she have hangers?

253
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:58,894
Sir?

254
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:05,197
No.

255
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:09,419
What is wrong with you?
He is new.

256
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:12,109
Your father.

257
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:15,170
No!

258
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:20,282
Children.

259
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,722
Find her!

260
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:30,454
- What is it?
- Have no idea.

261
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,927
Jeez.

262
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:39,384
1.25 million.

263
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:43,546
In unlabeled,
useless US dollars.

264
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:52,570
Delete the surveillance, it was the storm
and you've never seen me and the girl.

265
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:59,352
- What do you want with her?
- Nothing good.

266
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,881
- I can not.
- Why?

267
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:10,402
- She's only...
- And that makes it less true?

268
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:14,653
Give me a smile and get rich, -

269
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:17,324
- or you will all
die in a cruel way.

270
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:20,014
And nobody gets rich.

271
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:23,189
When I say cruel,

272
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,934
- I mean truly cruel.

273
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:28,034
Go away, Vance.

274
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:32,554
If you leave the door,
your answer is no.

275
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:39,886
- Do you decide here or not?
- Go away now.

276
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:46,117
Listen up. You are five guards
with power guns and strips.

277
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:50,698
You have no phone connection.

278
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:54,427
The nightmare police patrol does not come.

279
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,853
You can not stay
out or live alive.

280
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,373
What do you choose?

281
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:07,346
What do you choose, Vance?

282
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,328
- Vance? Vance!
- Shut up!

283
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:19,708
I decide.

284
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:24,211
"They do not let us go.
- I'm not saying it again!

285
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:26,937
They can not.
Think about it.

286
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,180
That's right.

287
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,717
What are you doing?

288
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:39,677
The real leader.
You should let him take the trash.

289
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:44,664
To get everyone in the building killed.

290
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:51,210
The country thanks for your service.

291
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,350
She is in the mall.

292
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,131
Exit the search.
Get all off the road.

293
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:20,454
- What do we do?
There are two approach roads.

294
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:23,342
There and there. Sniper on both.

295
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:28,167
There must be men you trust.
Spread them around the parking lot.

296
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:31,545
The radios are secured,
but no talk, -

297
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:35,204
- unless it is vital to life

298
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,024
Jamie?

299
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,436
My name is Eddie.

300
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,357
And...

301
00:29:55,492 --> 00:29:58,003
I know what happens.

302
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:03,153
You must trust someone.

303
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,045
You know that too well.

304
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,347
You know what?

305
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,508
I have a daughter of your age.

306
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:22,100
Her name is Sylvia.

307
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:25,977
And...

308
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,739
That was my mother too.

309
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:40,808
Jamie?

310
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,408
I knew you were smart.

311
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:13,520
I need dry clothes.

312
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,499
- Javel.
- And food.

313
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:19,997
You should not speak to
me, as I was a child.

314
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,060
It's a deal.

315
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:25,181
May I turn around now?

316
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,065
It's not even charged.

317
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:34,939
One last thing. You must
promise to protect me.

318
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,902
Yes.

319
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,902
- On scouting?
- You would not be treated like a child.

320
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:45,507
There is nothing in the way of scouting.

321
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,533
Oh God. You are the witness.

322
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,242
- Which?
- Tires 666.

323
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:58,104
Her father was the auditor.

324
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,001
Until he got the brilliant idea,
to help the FBI against them.

325
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:07,162
They discovered it and killed him.
She saw it all.

326
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:10,377
She will testify tomorrow

327
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:14,305
- I read the news?
Maybe they think she's safe now.

328
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:17,928
- Then you're kidding.
- The nacker and hell FBI escort, -

329
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:20,956
- but five fools in the
mall are too much.

330
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:23,216
They come back.

331
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:27,395
They closed the phones before
they knew she was here.

332
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:30,944
They knew how many we
are and where we were.

333
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:34,746
He came to the Montclair
entrance, not the other.

334
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:38,172
How can they know?
- The police patrol...

335
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,591
He said they did not come.

336
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,389
- Weapons?
- We have none.

337
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:46,779
Let's get away.

338
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,936
- How many are they?
- Is there a hiding place?

339
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,344
What? Forget it.
I will join.

340
00:32:57,464 --> 00:33:00,483
- You promised...
- To protect you.

341
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,138
We can not keep them out.

342
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:06,116
They come in, it's
just a matter of time.

343
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:09,488
- We must save her. Now!
- I know somewhere.

344
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,162
Come on.

345
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,212
Oh God.

346
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,230
Okay.

347
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:23,313
It is just ahead.

348
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:26,937
It's not much but hard to find.

349
00:33:30,865 --> 00:33:32,336
Well.

350
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:35,015
Here is a flashlight, -

351
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:38,639
- water and a radio

352
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:41,219
I know.

353
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:43,910
It's low frequency, but it works.

354
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,995
Its range is not long.

355
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:51,098
- Do not be afraid if nobody answers.
- I do not get scared.

356
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,610
Well. Do you miss anything else?

357
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:57,642
- A teddy bear or something?
- A teddy bear?

358
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:00,942
Did not you have a daughter of my age?

359
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,598
- You do not know anything, right?
"We do not see each other much.

360
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,468
My parents are dead. I have been in
witness protection for four years.

361
00:34:11,588 --> 00:34:14,660
Even though I survive and testify,

362
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,709
- I have neither a
family nor a home.

363
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:21,584
You'd better come.

364
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,464
Listen up. Lock the door.
Be quiet.

365
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:29,141
Do not get out, no
matter what you hear.

366
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,569
It's some fissure.

367
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:35,085
I promised to protect
you, so I will do that.

368
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:39,300
Lock the door.

369
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,882
Look here.

370
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,046
There.

371
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:57,028
- It is well.
- Pardon?

372
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,073
It is well.

373
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:03,216
Fun, because I think it's
the worst night of my life.

374
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:07,670
- He's bleeding.
- What do you mean?

375
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,317
If he knew that the
patrol did not come,

376
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,761
Then they had stormed the place.

377
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,613
But what are they doing?

378
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:22,524
Sets our cars out of game.

379
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:25,627
- They find Betty.
- What?

380
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:29,269
My gun under the seat.
A hidden weapon.

381
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:33,669
What is the meaning of a weapon
if you do not go with it?

382
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:38,207
Rules. No weapon here.

383
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:41,292
- We must go away.
- Impossible.

384
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:44,651
Yes, we can and should.

385
00:35:45,063 --> 00:35:49,278
There are men on their way to killing us.

386
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:53,063
And who are you really?

387
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:56,275
- You do not decide.
- He does now.

388
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,647
I will not die tonight.

389
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:02,862
If he can do better, get
up with your hands.

390
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:06,872
- sure.
- He is afraid.

391
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,867
He'll kill you.

392
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:13,139
He is professional.
High-Profiled.

393
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:17,211
Do you want to go home to your wife
and child, so stay in the building.

394
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:20,172
If you do not want to
help, find a hideaway.

395
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:22,612
Nobody condemns you.

396
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:25,266
Do you have a plan?

397
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:29,796
The attack took place 45 minutes ago.

398
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:34,393
The FBI now knows that she has disappeared.

399
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,824
- They will search for her.
- When?

400
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,845
We dont know.

401
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:47,671
But right now time is our enemy.

402
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:52,712
Let's make it to our friend.

403
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:04,766
There.

404
00:37:13,251 --> 00:37:14,416
Come on.

405
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:21,222
How do we get up on the roof?

406
00:37:23,984 --> 00:37:26,352
It's too bad.

407
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,756
Status?

408
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,523
Free lane at Route 6.

409
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,415
<i>Free lane here too.</i>

410
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:40,746
Off.

411
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,992
What the hell are we doing?
- Sends them a message.

412
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,943
Oh God!

413
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,844
Move!

414
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,381
It's probably not up to this.

415
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:44,906
Quickly!

416
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,569
Get cleaned up.

417
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,673
Run! Run!

418
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:04,866
- Fast!
- Wait...

419
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,289
Vance! Damn!

420
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:08,975
Wait for me!

421
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:10,374
Pis.

422
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,883
No...

423
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,560
- Ruby?
- Come on.

424
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:47,716
The worst guard to
have hangover on.

425
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,267
Take the sleeping bag.

426
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:01,052
Get the car away.

427
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:10,726
- Flashlight.
- Okay.

428
00:40:11,414 --> 00:40:14,933
Jeez. Hit the cards down.

429
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,592
What's really going on?

430
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,169
A girl appeared, now a
psychopath will kill her.

431
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:27,003
Now we have a whole gang behind us.

432
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:39,017
- The doors?
- Holds so far.

433
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:42,184
- On top...
- I have arranged that.

434
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,681
- Is it him?
- Eddie. He decides.

435
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:49,774
- Did you tell me what's happening?
- In general.

436
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:52,416
A girl and a gang.

437
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,648
I'm ready.

438
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:00,414
We do not have much time.

439
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:05,284
We have 30 minutes before
you reach Montclair.

440
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:09,516
A further 10 minutes to Zone B.
We must be ready.

441
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:13,627
- What is the plan?
- Buying time.

442
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:17,696
Get has on as many
of them as possible.

443
00:41:17,816 --> 00:41:21,308
If you get the chance to
turn on, do not hesitate.

444
00:41:21,456 --> 00:41:23,936
- I can shoot with a bow.
- I can make bombs.

445
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,129
What?

446
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,604
- the internet
- Let's get around.

447
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:29,771
Ruby, save yourself here.

448
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:33,678
Vance, the kitchen department.
You are the first line of defense.

449
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:37,725
Mason, garden supplies.
You are the guard post.

450
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:42,448
We just have to distract them long
enough, so the FBI will arrive.

451
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:51,607
Okay.

452
00:41:51,897 --> 00:41:53,840
Calm. It's a bomb.

453
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:01,121
Okay.

454
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:08,954
- Then it's ready.
- Departed.

455
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:18,710
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

456
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,492
Okay. Come on.

457
00:42:33,961 --> 00:42:35,303
Okay.

458
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:43,863
When the patrol comes...

459
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:47,559
If you see them, you will not go out.

460
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,944
They must come in here.

461
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:54,670
Remember. SEA.
Short, short...

462
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,306
... long, tall, long
Short, short, short.

463
00:42:58,426 --> 00:43:01,742
Short, short, long, long, long.

464
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:04,466
- Short, short...
- Listen now.

465
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:08,875
Do as I say, you can do it.

466
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:10,888
Off.

467
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:18,498
- What are you doing?
- Fit to myself.

468
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:22,334
If one of me gossip
to them, I'm done.

469
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:25,710
If I have to save, nobody
should know where.

470
00:43:26,424 --> 00:43:29,860
- I can help.
- No, we've talked about it.

471
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,344
- I have an idea.
- Real.

472
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:44,875
Clear the place. The car is ready.

473
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,062
Put it on.

474
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:07,599
Pis.

475
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,948
She is in the building.

476
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,005
Nobody gets out alive.

477
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:13,744
They are inside.

478
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:01,420
Channel 47.

479
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:09,530
47 is open.

480
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:13,446
<i>What should I call you?</i>

481
00:46:15,155 --> 00:46:18,521
- Eddie.
- Call me Charlie.

482
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:20,464
<i>Jaså...</i>

483
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,850
Last chance, Charlie.

484
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,453
The girl is gone.

485
00:46:28,094 --> 00:46:30,833
<i>Our patrol soon appears.</i>

486
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:34,565
<i>And the FBI, who has
discovered she's gone.</i>

487
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:39,529
We also have the home side advantage.

488
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:45,509
A little message to my men.

489
00:46:45,629 --> 00:46:49,860
Eddie, now where we talk together,

490
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,470
- It would also benefit
your team to hear this.

491
00:46:54,862 --> 00:46:57,175
Do everyone listen?

492
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:05,352
<i>To my men...</i>

493
00:47:06,774 --> 00:47:09,460
<i>I have talked to our employer.</i>

494
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,126
<i>After the mess of the evening,</i>

495
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:16,091
- is there a bonus in place.

496
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:22,463
If the girl dies, each
gets 100,000 on top.

497
00:47:23,555 --> 00:47:25,238
There comes a 'but'.

498
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,343
But if we fail...

499
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:31,730
<i>... and she survives.</i>

500
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,857
<i>Then everyone will be chased and killed.</i>

501
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:41,469
<i>Your family, friends and
pets are then shot.</i>

502
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,346
<i>So that's just to say...</i>

503
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:49,763
<i>... that I recommend we
get hold of her tonight.</i>

504
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:53,132
Let's get started.

505
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,032
Bastard.

506
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,910
Reports.

507
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,614
That's Vance.

508
00:50:58,215 --> 00:50:59,638
I'm innocent.

509
00:51:00,031 --> 00:51:01,453
<i>I'm fine too.</i>

510
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:06,920
I smell of cheap
hats, but I'm fine.

511
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:11,210
Mason? Can you hear us?

512
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:19,665
I'm on the way. Stay out

513
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,143
Mason?

514
00:51:31,544 --> 00:51:33,907
You just have to thank me.

515
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,143
Satan.

516
00:52:08,311 --> 00:52:10,625
Mason, it did not work.

517
00:52:10,745 --> 00:52:12,488
You must be away from there.

518
00:52:41,264 --> 00:52:43,929
The Sheriff has just turned off.

519
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:47,411
We have guests outside.
Nobody is shooting.

520
00:52:48,443 --> 00:52:51,197
Unless anyone tries something.

521
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:09,792
Do not do anything wrong.

522
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:15,021
A car.

523
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:18,080
Okay.

524
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,953
What in...?

525
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,903
It is broken.

526
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,222
I'm trying the door.

527
00:53:31,562 --> 00:53:33,677
- I'm going out there.
- No.

528
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:36,364
I do it.

529
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:44,910
Hey!

530
00:53:58,092 --> 00:53:59,797
Nice try.

531
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:06,710
Free path.

532
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,954
Clear the food department.

533
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,908
<i>Listen up. We just lost Johnny.</i>

534
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,691
<i>They mean it seriously.</i>

535
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:29,576
<i>You must be extremely careful.</i>

536
00:54:29,857 --> 00:54:32,148
Please reply.

537
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:34,021
<i>That's Vance.</i>

538
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:36,345
I'm still stuck.

539
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:39,025
I do not think I can get away.

540
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:42,701
Okay, Vance.
Can you see the food department?

541
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:48,371
No.

542
00:54:49,573 --> 00:54:51,666
Okay.

543
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:56,764
- Ruby? Mason?
- I'm still in D-2.

544
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:01,911
Stirs on Vance's ugly feather.

545
00:55:04,415 --> 00:55:06,939
Are you still alive, Mason?

546
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:12,612
Mason? Do you hear?

547
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,623
- Yes...
- Listen carefully.

548
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:24,890
We need someone to the food department.
What do you say?

549
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:29,578
No.

550
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:34,797
Mason, if you do not
move, they'll get you.

551
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:39,883
Are you still in the garden department?

552
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:50,562
- No...
- Where are you?

553
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,845
The warehouse.
I can not move myself.

554
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:07,567
It's Jamie.
I can help.

555
00:56:08,128 --> 00:56:12,590
Jamie, can you see in the food department?

556
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:15,593
Yes.

557
00:56:16,275 --> 00:56:20,011
"I have to know how many they are.
- Received.

558
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:26,409
Listen for everyone.

559
00:56:27,692 --> 00:56:31,467
We meet at Clives...

560
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:35,521
... about exactly three minutes.

561
00:56:35,752 --> 00:56:37,064
Received.

562
00:56:52,945 --> 00:56:54,307
Pis.

563
00:56:55,837 --> 00:56:58,892
<i>They are five.</i>

564
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:03,240
Okay, I'll take care of it.

565
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,103
Follow it!

566
00:57:19,329 --> 00:57:20,852
No!

567
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:40,009
Are you okay?

568
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:42,714
- I was worried.
- I'm fine.

569
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:44,316
Beware!

570
00:58:45,548 --> 00:58:48,985
I've got you! Satan!

571
00:58:49,705 --> 00:58:51,275
My Goodness!

572
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:20,205
Stop Mason!

573
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:24,160
It is me.

574
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:26,113
Okay?

575
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:29,329
Well.

576
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:36,369
Are you afraid?
We are going on.

577
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,356
We need it. Come on.

578
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:47,753
Close the gate! Close the gate!

579
01:00:03,807 --> 01:00:07,323
If you want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

580
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:12,438
- You saved him.
- You were not bad either.

581
01:00:24,177 --> 01:00:25,599
Open it.

582
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,521
Hey.

583
01:00:58,184 --> 01:01:00,238
I have a gift for you.

584
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,104
If you get trouble
and I'm not there...

585
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:07,730
-... so press here.
- I can use a power gun.

586
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:10,865
My mother had one.

587
01:01:16,624 --> 01:01:21,331
Lovely house.
Here is quite small but nice.

588
01:01:34,202 --> 01:01:36,075
It reminds me of something.

589
01:01:37,738 --> 01:01:40,320
- Where?
- At my Uncle Will.

590
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:44,577
I lived there in the
summer when I was little.

591
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,682
Then it was...

592
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,454
... normally.

593
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:56,954
One year my father said that
I could not have anymore.

594
01:01:59,102 --> 01:02:00,835
Do you see...

595
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,969
... fathers are not always perfect.

596
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:10,698
At least, some are at
home and not criminals.

597
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:15,410
- You defend him.
- Not at all.

598
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:21,489
It's hard to know why people
are doing some things.

599
01:02:21,935 --> 01:02:25,331
He may also have been scared.

600
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:28,095
Afraid? For what, though?

601
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:31,521
To put you in danger.

602
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,826
To blame you for something.

603
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:41,082
Maybe he was afraid of...

604
01:02:42,418 --> 01:02:44,397
... himself.

605
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,862
I do not know completely.

606
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:58,989
But right now...

607
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:04,941
... there is nobody
I feel safe with.

608
01:03:09,762 --> 01:03:12,055
<i>Let's talk together.</i>

609
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,195
Fire away.

610
01:03:19,888 --> 01:03:25,395
<i>You are at Clives,
without escape.</i>

611
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:28,480
Only a single steel gate, -

612
01:03:29,201 --> 01:03:31,545
- keep us cut off

613
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:35,983
I therefore offer
this one last time:

614
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,497
Give us the girl.

615
01:03:39,068 --> 01:03:41,662
Or I'm breathing ..

616
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,917
... and praise.

617
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:52,886
It's been two hours since you
let a child get away from you.

618
01:03:53,006 --> 01:03:58,017
The FBI can come at any time.
You're done, Charlie.

619
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:04,572
The patrol ran again, but you
probably remember your friend.

620
01:04:06,622 --> 01:04:09,235
<i>The answer has been received.</i>

621
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:12,571
- Ready or not.
- Come here.

622
01:04:26,413 --> 01:04:29,633
Police... oh god!

623
01:04:29,753 --> 01:04:32,968
The police are outside!

624
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,092
Eddie!

625
01:04:36,725 --> 01:04:38,857
The police are outside.

626
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:43,205
Just wait.

627
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,292
Communication carriage.

628
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,582
We must get rid of it.

629
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:53,371
Get rid of her.
Wait for me.

630
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:02,560
How are you doing, Vance?
- It's solid steel.

631
01:05:05,715 --> 01:05:07,864
It is not good.

632
01:05:13,635 --> 01:05:15,440
Help is on its way.

633
01:05:26,582 --> 01:05:28,505
The ball is given up.

634
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:05,005
- Down on Earth!
- I'm the guards.

635
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:08,691
- He has a weapon.
- No I have not.

636
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:11,956
- Is the girl here?
- Yes, in the warehouse.

637
01:06:12,076 --> 01:06:14,165
We hear shots from there.

638
01:06:14,285 --> 01:06:16,248
Move!

639
01:06:25,628 --> 01:06:27,922
I need help.

640
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,456
- Can we reach her?
- Can I use this?

641
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:15,700
Yes.

642
01:07:20,421 --> 01:07:23,626
Mason, come with the girl.

643
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:28,872
No, I can not move.

644
01:07:29,694 --> 01:07:32,779
Mason, get along.

645
01:07:34,882 --> 01:07:37,236
Jamie, are you listening?

646
01:07:37,696 --> 01:07:39,319
When i get up

647
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,055
... then you run into hell.

648
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:47,102
- What do you want to do?
- Do not think about it.

649
01:07:48,013 --> 01:07:52,844
But you get away from here and
get them down with your neck.

650
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:57,723
- Promise me it.
- Yes...

651
01:07:58,634 --> 01:08:00,100
Let's do it.

652
01:08:02,314 --> 01:08:04,889
It will be OK.

653
01:08:08,739 --> 01:08:09,991
Come on.

654
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:36,701
Such. What a shit guard.

655
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:03,343
She trusts you so she's
coming here, right?

656
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,034
Jamie, keep in mind.

657
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:20,921
<i>You can not go home without your teddy bear.</i>

658
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,802
What?

659
01:09:23,273 --> 01:09:24,920
Johnny!

660
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,142
Mason?

661
01:10:15,464 --> 01:10:18,812
Vance? Jamie?

662
01:10:21,026 --> 01:10:23,173
I thought you were dead.

663
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:30,637
- Are you in love with you?
- No.

664
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:35,956
- I think you shot him.
- Pokkers.

665
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:41,970
Listen up.

666
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:46,687
They are in the store.

667
01:10:46,928 --> 01:10:50,662
<i>You must be very quiet
and very strong.</i>

668
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:56,597
What our team has accomplished
must not be in vain.

669
01:10:57,769 --> 01:11:00,128
<i>You must also go home.</i>

670
01:11:01,928 --> 01:11:03,290
To your daughter.

671
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:07,708
Exactly.

672
01:11:08,759 --> 01:11:10,524
What do we do?

673
01:11:10,874 --> 01:11:14,039
Do you remember what we
did with Ruby's stuff?

674
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,192
Where we put them?

675
01:11:16,994 --> 01:11:19,400
In the seniors department.

676
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:24,010
Get her radio.
The real one.

677
01:11:24,722 --> 01:11:28,087
Guard radio.

678
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:30,660
Okay.

679
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,887
It has emergency channels.

680
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:40,281
There will be noise first, but
clear sound if I can handle it.

681
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:46,101
When that happens, find
a hideaway and shout.

682
01:11:46,952 --> 01:11:49,977
The good ones will listen and help us.

683
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:53,890
When you get through,
wait for me.

684
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:57,095
<i>Then I get you.</i>

685
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:00,826
On scouting?

686
01:12:03,882 --> 01:12:05,265
On scouting.

687
01:12:06,286 --> 01:12:09,642
Are you able to do it?
Can I count on you?

688
01:12:14,405 --> 01:12:15,960
I can do that.

689
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:21,818
See you soon.

690
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:30,434
You and I, dare.
You and I.

691
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,081
He goes after the noise transmitter.

692
01:14:02,693 --> 01:14:04,326
Jamie?

693
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:18,984
I know you're in here...

694
01:14:19,227 --> 01:14:21,392
... and that you can hear me.

695
01:14:23,244 --> 01:14:27,270
We were on a 20 km country road.

696
01:14:28,683 --> 01:14:31,880
The rain removed the
tracks and we the cars.

697
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,637
They do not know where we
joined the FBI escort.

698
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:37,740
There is no one.

699
01:14:38,602 --> 01:14:40,772
It's time to negotiate.

700
01:16:27,025 --> 01:16:30,351
Pis. Get the cart away.

701
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,539
Jamie?

702
01:17:05,522 --> 01:17:06,795
Jamie ?!

703
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:10,114
<i>Jamie? Do you hear me?</i>

704
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,567
Jamie?

705
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:18,942
<i>Jamie, can you hear me?</i>

706
01:17:26,665 --> 01:17:30,306
My name is Jamie.
The shopping center in Ridgeside. Help...

707
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:41,552
Do not shoot. He is mine.

708
01:17:45,478 --> 01:17:47,708
Nice to meet you, Betty.

709
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,897
Pis.

710
01:18:21,737 --> 01:18:23,129
Jamie...?

711
01:18:30,191 --> 01:18:33,985
<i>Jamie? This is the police.</i>

712
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:36,840
<i>Jamie, can you hear us?</i>

713
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,704
He's gone, Jamie.

714
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:51,654
Like everyone else does when
things get complicated.

715
01:18:52,716 --> 01:18:54,690
When I was at your age,

716
01:18:55,221 --> 01:19:00,269
- My father woke me up and
asked me to pack a bag.

717
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,957
I was happy.

718
01:19:03,424 --> 01:19:07,920
I had only been from
home quite a few times.

719
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,002
I fell asleep.

720
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:13,884
When I woke up, my
father was gone.

721
01:19:16,408 --> 01:19:21,086
There were 50 caps in my jacket pocket.

722
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:26,000
I never saw him again.

723
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:34,637
Now we make an appointment.

724
01:19:35,094 --> 01:19:38,145
From one left soul to another.

725
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:42,859
You do not have to die,
you just can not testify.

726
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:49,840
You come with me.
I'll get both of us safe.

727
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,147
Then we start from somewhere else.
I will help you.

728
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,299
Maybe I can teach you one thing or two.

729
01:20:01,523 --> 01:20:02,875
Who knows?

730
01:20:37,137 --> 01:20:41,637
You must make an important decision.

731
01:20:42,298 --> 01:20:46,880
You can be the child in vain
waiting for the white knight.

732
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:52,599
You can be immature and stupid
if you fly where I saw...

733
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:56,108
... have no choice
but to kill you.

734
01:20:58,008 --> 01:21:01,027
You can also get up.

735
01:21:01,969 --> 01:21:04,452
Then we arrange this as adults.

736
01:21:06,256 --> 01:21:07,498
So...

737
01:21:10,022 --> 01:21:12,301
What will it be?

738
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:20,112
Okay. If that's the way you want to play?

739
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,315
No! No!

740
01:21:25,435 --> 01:21:28,501
Eddie!

741
01:21:32,572 --> 01:21:34,856
Eddie...

742
01:21:35,787 --> 01:21:37,851
You could have been rich.

743
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:42,758
I said you should take the
money and turn your back.

744
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:48,222
As you said, Charlie, it's me...

745
01:21:49,194 --> 01:21:51,912
... that determines.

746
01:21:53,468 --> 01:21:55,241
You said...

747
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,244
Jamie.

748
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:05,482
You know how it works.

749
01:22:24,627 --> 01:22:25,859
Jamie.

750
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:30,717
Get up. Come on.

751
01:22:31,929 --> 01:22:35,745
Come on.

752
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:37,386
Look at me.

753
01:22:58,237 --> 01:22:59,720
There she is.

754
01:23:01,072 --> 01:23:05,400
We have contact with
Jamie, alive at Ridgeside.

755
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:12,883
Stop! Hands up!

756
01:24:29,066 --> 01:24:30,128
Hello.

757
01:24:35,692 --> 01:24:37,034
Hi...

758
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,662
You look like shit.

759
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:54,016
I feel like that too.

760
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,787
I will travel soon.

761
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,782
Evidently.

762
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:08,360
So...

763
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:15,313
I just wanted to say
thank you before I left.

764
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:24,097
You have nothing to worry
about, with your daughter.

765
01:25:25,064 --> 01:25:27,748
She is lucky to have you as a dad.

766
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:38,344
- Where are you going?
- For a foster family.

767
01:25:38,464 --> 01:25:41,013
They did not tell me.

768
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:53,005
You will be fine.

769
01:25:55,323 --> 01:25:57,851
I have a good feeling.

770
01:26:00,957 --> 01:26:02,815
Who?

771
01:26:11,658 --> 01:26:14,003
Uncle Will!

772
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:23,025
Come on.
