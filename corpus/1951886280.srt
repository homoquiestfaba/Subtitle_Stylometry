this spicy fish pasta sauce,

And then, God, you ruin it by tailing us.

1007
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:51,228
Did you think we couldn't see you?
You were practically glowing.

1008
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:56,004
So, we both fucked up. Great, I'm glad
we got that straightened out. Now what?

1009
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,004
MITCH: Help.

1010
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:10,748
Look, I don't care what's going on, all right?

1011
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:15,922
I'm not going to do anything about it
or pass judgment.

1012
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,535
I just want to know the truth.

1013
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,263
I have to know the truth.

1014
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,173
Books.

1015
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:36,309
- What?
- We smuggle rare and valuable books.

1016
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,909
Cultural artifacts, basically.

1017
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,816
You're smuggling books.

1018
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,859
You're telling me that Bob guy can read.
No way. All right?

1019
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,757
Who the hell cares about books,
for Christ's sake?

1020
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:51,560
Oh, you'd be surprised, people pay a ton
for this stuff on the black market.

1021
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:56,694
Well, we've got a network of buyers.
Someone wants a particular item,

1022
01:17:56,805 --> 01:18:00,104
we steal it from a museum
or a private collection,

1023
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:04,042
it doesn't matter where in the world it is.
And then we smuggle it here,

1024
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:08,742
stuffed in lizards, armadillos,
jack rabbits, whatever.

1025
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:11,478
Books?

1026
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:15,181
Since I'm being so honest,
that stuff I told you about monkfish

1027
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:19,321
and how I cut off my finger trying to cook,
it was only sort of true.

1028
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,685
I wasn't cooking,

1029
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:25,927
I was at Bob's trying to wrestle
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> out of an armadillo.

1030
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,901
<i>We went to the warehouse</i>
<i>to pick up the latest shipment,</i>

1031
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:32,440
<i>which is where we always meet the guys</i>
<i>who smuggle in the stuff.</i>

1032
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:37,001
<i>We were expecting some Joyce from</i>
<i>the British Museum, some Dostoevsky,</i>

1033
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:40,548
<i>the Capote armadillo, a Virginia Woolf boar.</i>

1034
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,914
<i>Everything looked fine, so we brought</i>
<i>the stuff back to Woodsman Bob's</i>

1035
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,953
<i>and I started to cut open the animals.</i>

1036
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:49,057
<i>I was having a hard time</i>
<i>with that stupid armadillo.</i>

1037
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,682
<i>Its skin was like armor, you know?</i>

1038
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:53,988
<i>I turned on the power saw,</i>
<i>which was really kind of dumb,</i>

1039
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,496
<i>'cause I could have ruined the book.</i>

1040
01:18:56,598 --> 01:19:00,694
Next thing I knew, blood was pumping out
from where my finger used to be.

1041
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:04,932
<i>I went into shock,</i>
<i>seeing all that blood and junk.</i>

1042
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,736
<i>Bob was worried about the cops showing up</i>
<i>because I'd been screaming,</i>

1043
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:11,574
<i>so he and Jimmy,</i>
<i>the guy who lives in your building,</i>

1044
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:16,845
<i>they emptied the place, and Jimmy brought</i>
<i>everything to his apartment for safekeeping.</i>

1045
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,919
An ambulance finally came
and took me to the hospital,

1046
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,649
but we never found my finger.

1047
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,886
I was pretty pissed,
it's not like I could just grow another one.

1048
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:28,462
But how did it end up in my place?
That's what...

1049
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,622
I don't know. It was lost.

1050
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:34,625
Maybe it got mixed up with everything
Jimmy brought back to his apartment,

1051
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,534
and then, I don't know.

1052
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,472
What does it matter, Wiley?

1053
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,945
I care for you.

1054
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:52,713
And there's this all this other stuff,
please don't ask me about it anymore, okay?

1055
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,123
I really do care for you,

1056
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:02,219
and if you don't believe anything else
I've said, please believe that.

1057
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,904
I need you to take me back to the shop.

1058
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:23,348
You shouldn't turn yourself in because of
some fucked up loyalty to Bob and Jimmy.

1059
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:27,387
They wouldn't do it for you,
and what good's it going to do anybody?

1060
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,286
Bob's my father.

1061
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,192
Excuse me?

1062
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,387
Bob's my father.

1063
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:39,031
Bob with the eyes?
Bob, the l-stuff-my-pets Bob?

1064
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:42,865
What about him being electrocuted,
you running away, all that?

1065
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,336
I lied.

1066
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,578
Look, I can't desert him.

1067
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:55,013
Would you desert your dad if you thought
you might be able to help him?

- Is that all you have to say?
- No.

1084
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,602
That's great you quit the bookstore.
I'm very proud.

1085
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:33,140
I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet.
I want to explore some options.
