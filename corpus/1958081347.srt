Knock, knock!

518
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,500
Now you say, "Who's there?", sire.

519
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,041
I have to participate?

520
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,333
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.

521
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,250
Who is there?

522
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,208
King Guy. [CHUCKLES]

523
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,791
- What?
- No.

524
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,291
You say, "King Guy, who?", sire.

525
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,041
Oh, I really don't get it.

526
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,666
Guards, tar him!

527
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,166
- No, no!
- [GUARD] All right.

528
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,833
- Wait.
- Okay, fine.

529
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,250
- Feather him.
- What?

530
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,416
- No, no!
- Ooh, I have an idea.

531
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,750
What about a little of both?
Could be a fun new thing.

532
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,833
Please, sire.

533
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,458
It would be wrong
to orphan this man's children.

534
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,583
Fine, then.

535
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,625
- Kill the kids too.
- No!

536
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,208

The queen tells me that as a tormentor,
you're unparalleled.

00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,041
Sire, are you aware that he is the one

548
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,750
who invented
your most successful torture device?

549
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,041
You mean my mother-in-law?

Of course, you are. Very funny, sire.

The queen tells me
that you're very fond of oysters.

569
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,916
Well, I've never actually tried them.

570
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,666
Never actually tried one? Oh.

571
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,416
Then you must try the food of kings.

572
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,916
Fresh Belon oysters.

573
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:42,750

Sweet baby Jesus.

00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:01,958
Have another.

579
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,250
Another oyster, my king?

Please, call me Guy.

- Okay. Thank you, Guy.

How dare you call the king of France

00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,416
- Guards, off with his head!
- [QUASI] What?

[HENRI LAUGHING] Yes. Good one, sire.

00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:28,791
Catherine, I wish to speak to Quasi alone
about things you would not understand.

00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,916
So leave us.

What things?

00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,375
Male things.

592
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,916
Foreskins, Adam's apples,
hemorrhoids and the like.

593
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,708
Many women suffer from hemorrhoids.

594
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,583
- In fact, last week...
- Leave us!

Hmm.

There may be goblins in there.

You want me to do what?

At your private confession,

613
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:28,500
I want you to assassinate the pope
in the name of France.

614
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,000
But it's the pope.

615
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,833

[SIGHS]
Your Majesty, why have you chosen me?

633
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,791
God chose you when you won the lottery.

634
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:12,541
And God knows
that only you can take him by surprise.

635
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,458
Yes. In the confessional, there will be
a dagger hidden under the bench.

636
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,583
You will drive that dagger
into the pope's heart.

[SIGHS] Your Majesty, I cannot do this.

Who gives a fuck?

00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,833
You will assassinate the pope,

- Are you gonna kill him?
- He can't do that. It's the pope.

00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,583
- You could run away.
- No, the king would find me.

he's gonna draw and quarter Duchamp.

01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,166
- Um, question.
- Mmm.

1531
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,666
If you and I are cousins,
does not that make me royalty?

1532
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:42,375
Yes. You are in the line of kings.

1533
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,583
Now, enter me with your royal member.

1534
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:51,625
My lady, I'm new at this.
Enter you... where?

1535
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,291
[KING GUY] <i>Qu'est-ce que c'est</i>?

1536
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:03,958
[CATHERINE MOANING]

1537
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,291
[QUASI MOANING]

1538
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:14,000
Oh, no!

1539
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,666
- My queen!
- [PANTING]

1540
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,166
Thank God you're finally here.

1541
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,125
- What happened?
- [GROANS]

1542
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:24,583
Well, he called to me with his siren song.
I was hypnotized.

1543
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:27,166
I have heard tell
of the sweet song of the hunchback.

1544
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:31,250
Then he strapped me here and left
hours ago. So many, many hours.

1545
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,791
- [KING GUY] Let's go!
- [POPE CORNELIUS] Out of the way!

1546
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:40,041
Okay, fine.

1547
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:43,000
Assholes.

1548
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,041
That was something.

1549
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:53,291
Indeed. Yes, you must be so relieved
that the queen is safe.

1550
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:54,666
Of course, of course.

1551
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:58,750
But you must be terrified with that
lumpy little maniac on the loose.

1552
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,333
Why should I be terrified?
You should be terrified, not me.

1553
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:05,083
I'm not terrified. You heard the queen.
He's long gone.

1554
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,125
There's no way we're going to...

1555
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:08,458
Catch him.

1556
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:09,958
[POPE CORNELIUS] Ah, yes, of course.

1557
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:12,291
So it's really no big deal then
if we never do...

1558
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,041
Find him.

1559
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,250
- [WHISPERING] Find him and kill him.
- [WHISPERING] What?

1560
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,041
[WHISPERING] Find that little shit
and kill him.

1561
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:23,166
[WHISPERING] You want me
to go take a shit?

1562
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,583
Why? Do you have to?

1563
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:26,541
- I don't have to.
- Then why would you?

1564
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:30,541
Find him
and catch him so he does not speak.

1565
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,375
Bind his ankles to his cheeks?

1566
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,416
Quasi.

1567
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,458
- Oh, the little hunchback?
- Yes.

1568
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:39,291
You can't call them hunchback.
You have to say orthopedically challenged.

1569
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,041
- My apologies. Yes.
- No, no, no, it's a whole, you know.

1570
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,375
- [CHUCKLES]
- [CLAUDE] Yes.

1571
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:50,416
[NORMAL VOICE] Weird weather we're having.

1572
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,708
[NORMAL VOICE] I know, I know,
we were just saying that. So weird, weird.

1573
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:56,833
[GOAT BLEATS]

1574
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:57,916
[WHISTLING]

1575
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:02,958
Ah, garlic, I... Mmm.

1576
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,791
You know what would be great?
Maybe some Brie.

1577
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,791
Oh, these top shelves are so handy.

1578
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:12,041
Michel.

1579
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,416
Quasi.

1580
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,375
Whoa, you are fuckin' tall, <i>mon frére.</i>

1581
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:19,291
Things are very <i>dangereuse,</i> Quasi.
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

1582
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,791
Then it's <i>dangereuse</i> for Duchamp as well.
I need to warn him.

1583
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:27,666
Let's rendezvous at Dupont Fork
in one hour.

1584
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,583
I'm rendezvousing
with Queen Catherine there as well.

1585
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,166
Name drop much? [CHUCKLES]

1586
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:39,041
[GASPS] Duchamp! <i>Mon Dieu!</i>

1587
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:43,458
Duchamp, I am so sorry.

1588

[DUCHAMP GROANS]

1589
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,583
Holy shit, it's bright.

1590
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:50,041
- Du! Get up.
- [GROANING]

1591
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,625
- Oh, my fuckin' head.
- Get up!

1592
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:53,708
Oh, God.

1593
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:56,458
Oh, God.
What are you, weighing in at 19 stone?

1594
01:11:56,541 --> 01:12:02,041
Okay. My balance is... is... is... <i>fakakte</i>.
Okay. Oh, Jesus.

1595
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,500
- Are you drunk?
- [DUCHAMP] Hold on.

1596
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,500
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in that cave?

1597
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:10,125
Du, so many incredible things have
happened since we saw each other last.

1598
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,333
Oh, yeah, let me guess.

1599
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:13,708
You won another lottery,
and you rode a dragon

1600
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:16,375
- to the top of <i>Mont</i> Ménage à Trois.
- No.

1601
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,166
- You sixty-nined a unicorn.
- No.

1602
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,875
You slid down a rainbow
into a chocolate river.

1603
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,166
- Okay...
- Where there was an orgy.

1604
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,291
- Okay, Duch...
- With wizards.

1605
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:25,500
No. I was captured by the king.

1606
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:29,333
And then, my new lover,
Queen Catherine, freed me.

1607
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,833
We're running away together
to the Amalfi Coast.

1608
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:34,416
And then,
it's off to Barcelona in wintertime.

1609
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,791
Listen to yourself.

1610
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,500
My new lover, Queen Catherine?

1611
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,333
- Yeah.
- Barcelona?

1612
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,583
Oh, I also learned
that I'm cousin to the queen.

1613
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:42,666
Oh, come on!

1614
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,291
Okay, look, we gotta go.

1615
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,708
You're lucky the guards didn't grab you
at the cave last night.

1616
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:48,125
I have no idea how they found me.

1617
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:51,208
Only the queen, Michel,
and you knew about that cave.

1618
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,500
But none of you
would ever tell anybody about that.

1619
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:56,833
Well, I-I... I may have told one person.

1620
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:58,666
What?

1621
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,708
And that person may have been Lucien.

1622
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,125
Why would you do that?

1623
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:05,208
'Cause the plan didn't work.

1624
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,333
I was supposed to be the hero,
but you were!

1625
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:12,875
And then I went to the cave, and I saw you
in there with the queen, laughing.

1626
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:15,916
So you told Lucien?
Didn't you realize what would happen?

1627
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,208
That was my ticket.

1628
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:20,000
Duchamp, you betrayed me.

1629
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:23,125
I used to be the big swinging dick
in this relationship.

1630
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:27,291
You were just sad, lonely Quasi,
and I was big, jolly Duchamp.

1631
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:28,625
Everyone knew my name.

1632
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:32,333
"How's it hangin', Champ?
What's up, Duch?"

1633
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:35,083
I didn't have to be your friend.
I took pity on you.

1634
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:38,333
Okay, well,
let me tell you something, Duchamp.

1635
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,125
You may have once been
the big swinging dick,

1636
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:45,500
but now that big swinging dick
has swung back in the other direction.

1637
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:47,541
And I can tell you one thing for sure.

1638
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:49,666
I never would have betrayed
my best friend.

1639
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,000
Well, that's perfect,
'cause we're not best friends.

1640
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,875
You put a knife in my back.

Behold, the best friend

1655
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:30,958
What? We're not friends.

1656
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,416
I stopped him from killing the king.
I was the hero.

1657
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,500
What are you talking about?

1658
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,166
Up there on the stage. I stopped him.

1659
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,500
Does anyone here remember that?

1660
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:41,833
I definitely remember
the handsome hunchback.

1661
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:44,166
Are you kidding me?
It happened right there.

1662
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,416
Where is the hunchback?

1663
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,041
I have no idea.

1664
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:52,666
Well, perhaps a public torturing at
the coronation will refresh your memory.

1665
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:59,583
Unless, of course,
the hunchback is here listening.

1666
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:05,250
Perhaps he'd like to show himself
to save his best friend.

1667
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,291
I told you, he's not my friend.
I hate that twisted, creepy virgin.

1668
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,666
[QUASI] He's not a virgin anymore!

1669
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,416
Who said that? Show yourself.

01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,208
- Enough. Take him away.
- [GUARD] Yes, sire.

about this, right? Hold on. Hold on.

Ah, Quasi. How'd you see me?

What are you talking about? I see
your head sticking out of the bush.

1678
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:52,833
You should try hiding.

1679
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:55,541
I am hiding. I'm behind a bush.
It's like the tallest bush in the forest.

1680
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,250
Yeah, okay, come on. We gotta go.

1681

for our journey.

Oh, yeah. It was a knife from the guards.
Stuck in the fatty deposit of my hump.
