00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,482
You ain't
scared of nothing, huh?

1241
00:48:45,517 --> 00:48:46,517
Would y'all come on?

1242
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:48,448
Be realistic, please.

1243
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:50,206
Of course I was scared.

1244
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,034
But I had a few drinks,

1245
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:54,000
I loosened up

1246
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:56,172
and I was able to do my thing

1247
00:48:56,206 --> 00:48:59,551
and I'm gonna keep it 100
with you right now.

1248
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:02,103
It felt good.

1249
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:03,758
I mean, to be honest with you,

1250
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:06,620
it was the biggest rush I have
ever had in my life!

1251
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:08,586
Am I the only person that
sees something wrong with this?

1252
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,103
All right, all right,
Kaleta, I admit,

1253
00:49:10,137 --> 00:49:12,551
this ain't for
everybody, baby girl, it's not.

1254
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,275
But the money?

1255
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,448
The money is ridiculous.

1256
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:18,758
I mean, on a good night,
I make like $1,000.

1257
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:20,793
That's $1,000.That's $1,000 right there.

1258
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:24,620
But on a real good night,
oh, the money is bananas.

1259
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:26,965
Now y'all tell me where else I'm
gonna find this kind of money.

1260
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,413
Yeah, especially without a GED.

1261
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:30,206
Kaleta.
What?

1262
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:32,379
She doesn't have one!

1263
00:49:32,413 --> 00:49:34,896
She doesn't.

1264
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,172
Move. Shut up.

1265
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,517
Sorry.

1266
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:38,724
She doesn't have one.

1267
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,551
Okay, you're telling me
you make $1,000 a night?

1268
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:42,000
Yes, every night,

1269
00:49:42,034 --> 00:49:44,310
and sometimes
it's more than that, Em.

1270
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:46,551
That explains the Manolos.

1271
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:48,137
And the Gucci

1272
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:50,862
and the Prada
and the Cadillac Escalade

1273
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:53,034
sitting on 22s that
I'm picking up today.

1274
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:56,586
Holler at your girl!

1275
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,655
Come on, y'all.

1276
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:00,793
I look at it like this.

1277
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:02,068
I've been giving it up
to these dudes

1278
00:50:02,103 --> 00:50:04,379
all these years

1279
00:50:04,413 --> 00:50:08,413
only to be cheated on
and have my heart broken.

1280
00:50:08,448 --> 00:50:10,034
Well, from now on,
only thing about me

1281
00:50:10,068 --> 00:50:12,137
that's gonna ever be
broke is my heart.

1282
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:13,724
Okay, Am... Pass...

1283
00:50:13,758 --> 00:50:15,068
Whatever your name is. Oh, God.

1284
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:16,758
What is up with
this whole VIP thing?

1285
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:18,965
Oh, okay, VIP is where
the fellas go to spend

1286
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,310
a little personal time with
one of us girls, you feel me?

1287
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:23,034
No.
No.

1288
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:24,310
Man, it's real simple.

1289
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:26,482
Tricks come in, they pay
like $40 to the house,

1290
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,275
some of 'em wanna
get a little dance,

1291
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,517
some of 'em wanna get
a little feel.

1292
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:31,896
Some of 'em want
a little but more than that.

1293
00:50:31,931 --> 00:50:33,827
It all just depends on how far
a girl is willing to go.

1294
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:35,241
Whoa, whoa,
hey, wait, wait, wait.

1295
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:38,241
You're saying when they go up to
that little room, that's the...

1296
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:39,275
So they...

1297
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:41,241
No.
Yes, yes!

1298
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:43,344
No, listen, y'all,
anything goes up in there.

1299
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:44,724
Hear me out.

1300
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:46,379
Okay, look, some of them fools
that come up in there,

1301
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:48,448
they married, all they
want is a little excitement.

1302
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:50,068
Every now and then you're gonna
sit down with a weirdo,

1303
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:52,310
he just wants some conversation.

1304
00:50:53,793 --> 00:50:55,482
Oh, yeah.

1305
00:50:55,517 --> 00:50:57,655
But most of them jokers...

1306
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:59,103
Baby, most of them
jokers is trying to

1307
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:01,448
get what's in between them legs.

1308
00:51:01,482 --> 00:51:03,310
Oh, not mine, Jesus.Uh-huh.

1309
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,172
Close your legs, what you doing?

1310
00:51:05,206 --> 00:51:06,241
Oh, yeah.

1311
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:07,448
And they getting it, too.

1312
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,620
Anywhere from $20 and up.$20?

1313
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:10,931
$20.

1314
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:12,344
And let me tell you
something else about VIP.

1315
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:13,586
You gotta watch
your back, right?

1316
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,068
'Cause undercover
be coming up in there,

1317
00:51:15,103 --> 00:51:17,103
putting them girls in handcuffs,
they be walking out, I be like,

1318
00:51:17,137 --> 00:51:18,724
"Damn, you busted..." Wait, wait, wait, wait...

1319
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:21,068
Yo, yo, yo, yo, you be up
with the $20 crew?

1320
00:51:21,103 --> 00:51:22,448
Girl, no,
I don't do all of that.

1321
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,793
I go in, I do my dance
and I bounce.

1322
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:26,793
Get my money, that's all I do.
Whatever.

1323
00:51:26,827 --> 00:51:28,793
So basically what you're saying
is you all are hookers.

1324
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:29,931
Really? No, no, no, no, no, no...

1325
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:31,379
Did you just call me a hooker?

1326
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:32,689
No, but that's what it is. We been friends
for how long?

1327
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:33,793
You get money... Remember when
that little boy

1328
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:34,965
took your stuff around
the playground?

1329
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,896
[ALL YELLING]

1330
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:38,862
Stop it!

1331
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,137
Ren, Stimpy, go in the corner.

1332
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:41,448
Don't tell me to go in
the corner, she's a hooker.

1333
00:51:41,482 --> 00:51:43,172
I ain't no hooker. You a hooker.

1334
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:44,689
No, I ain't no hooker. Yes, you are.

1335
00:51:44,724 --> 00:51:47,068
Shut up! Shut up!

1336
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,448
Dang.
I can't do this.

1337
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,448
Okay, look. You're stressing me out.

1338
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:50,724
Okay, listen.

1339
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:51,758
Emily, please, if you
give me a couple minutes,

1340
00:51:51,793 --> 00:51:53,413
I'll explain it to you, please.

1341
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:55,034
Break it down
like I'm a toddler.

1342
00:51:55,068 --> 00:51:57,137
Okay, listen, it's real simple.

1343
00:51:57,172 --> 00:52:00,034
I go in, I throw the house
$10, right?

1344
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:01,517
I give the bouncer
a little something

1345
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,344
so he can play
my favorite music for me.

1346
00:52:03,379 --> 00:52:06,655
I give Cat, the house mother,
a little something-something,

1347
00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:10,034
but the rest of
that bread, baby girl,

1348
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:12,758
the rest of that bread
is all mine.

1349
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:14,206
All of it.

1350
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:16,758
And it sure beats the hell out
of working at some damn Subway

1351
00:52:16,793 --> 00:52:18,827
like Kaleta stuck over here
in this corner.

1352
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:21,103
Yeah, and they only
get $5 for they foot-longs.

1353
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,275
See what I'm saying? Kaleta!

1354
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,448
What?
Really?

1355
00:52:23,482 --> 00:52:25,206
It's true!

1356
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:27,379
But it's true, Emily.

1357
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:28,655
Oh.

1358
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:30,206
Okay.

1359
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:32,413
All right, listen,
I got one more question.

1360
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:33,517
What? Just a minute.

1361
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:34,689
Y'all wearing me out
with the questions.

1362
00:52:34,724 --> 00:52:35,827
Please. What?

1363
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:37,344
Will you talk some sense
into her, please.

1364
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:38,793
Hush, foot-long.

1365
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:44,068
What does it...

1366
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:46,206
feel like
when you're up on the stage?

1367
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:48,655
Girl, you're not supposed to ask
her what it feels like, Emily.

1368
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:51,000
Baby...

1369
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:55,862
it's like a feeling
that I ain't never,

1370
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:58,793
ever felt in my life.

1371
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:01,172
You hot? Uh-huh.

1372
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,862
I mean, it's the ultimate,
ultimate fantasy.

1373
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:05,965
Ooh.

1374
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,551
'Cause when I'm on that stage,

1375
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:11,172
I feel like I'm making love

1376
00:53:11,206 --> 00:53:15,586
to every man in that audience.

1377
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,103
Ooh, Papi.

1378
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:18,862
Ooh, Mommy.

1379
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,034
There's my mommy.
Hey!

1380
00:53:20,068 --> 00:53:21,310
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

1381
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:23,000
Praise the Lord, Pastor.

1382
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,482
Hallelujah!

1383
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:27,000
Hallelujah.
Yes, ma'am.

1384
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:28,310
What's going on in here?

1385
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:30,241
We just sitting here, talking
about Jesus, as usual.

1386
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:35,482
There's your gym bag,
Mama, and I'll be back.

1387
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:37,068
All right, sugar,
all right, all right.

1388
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:38,310
Hi, Gammy.
Hey...

1389
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:39,793
Hi, Grandma.
How y'all doing?

1390
00:53:39,827 --> 00:53:41,172
[AMBER] We doing all
right, look at you, Grandma.

1391
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:43,655
You look so cute in your
peach little jogging suit.

1392
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:45,000
Girl, I'm trying to get
this body together

1393
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:47,655
for the summer, baby. I know, that's right.

1394
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:48,793
Well, you know what, Grandma?

1395
00:53:48,827 --> 00:53:49,965
We were on our way out.

1396
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,344
I'll call you, okay?

1397
00:53:51,379 --> 00:53:53,344
I gotta take Kaleta to work,
I gotta make a couple runs.

1398
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:54,724
Wait a minute.

1399
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:56,310
No, but you... you really ain't
got to go nowhere now.

1400
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:57,758
But we don't want to
be in the way, Grandma.

1401
00:53:57,793 --> 00:53:59,241
Baby, you're not in the way,
just make sure she gone.

1402
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:01,034
Just make sure...

1403
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:02,758
She's gone, I think. Yeah, she gone, she gone.

1404
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:04,517
How y'all been doing? Good.

1405
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:06,310
Now you know
I've been going down

1406
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:08,068
to the YMCA for my
aerobics class.

1407
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:10,000
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1408

having a prayer service

I'm sorry, I forgot.

at the hospital,

you were part-time?

to you about that.

I would take one semester off.

just listen to the plan...

... on that Howard University
diploma.

1578

I have some other dreams here,
you know, and if I don't

1579
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,379
go after them now,
I may never get another chance.

1580
00:59:41,413 --> 00:59:43,172
But, baby, you have
all that time.

1581
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:44,379
No, I don't have a lot of time.

1583
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,379
for a second about what
I really want?

see your name on that...

1586
00:59:50,689 --> 00:59:53,379
Mom, I'm not saying
I won't go back, okay?

1587
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:55,413
It's just... not everything fits
into a neat little plan

1588
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:56,655
like you think it does.

1589
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:58,103
I really wanna go after this. But, baby...

1590
00:59:58,137 --> 00:59:59,689
Mama has made sacrifices.

1591
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,758
I have scrimped and saved. Mom, okay.

1592
01:00:01,793 --> 01:00:03,620
I'll pay you back. I spent all my extra money.

1593
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:04,896
I'll pay you back.

1594
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:06,965
Emily, I spent every extra dime
on your classes,

1595
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,620
your books, your materials.

1596
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:10,000
Nursing is expensive. Are you even...

1597
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:12,241
Would you listen to
what I want to do, please?

1598
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,275
I made plans.

1599
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,413
I have planned for your success.

1600
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:16,034
I want you to do better
than I did.

1601
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:17,310
Mom...

1602
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:19,379
Mama's trying to make you do
better than I did.

1603
01:00:19,413 --> 01:00:21,448
You're trying to make me do... My plans are for you, baby.

1604
01:00:21,482 --> 01:00:24,034
And that's the problem.

1605
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:25,965
Mama, what are you
talking about?

1606
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,586
What do you mean?

1607
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,206
You know exactly what I mean.

1608
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:30,896
No, I don't know what you mean.

1609
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,000
Now, I didn't want to
get involved, but listen.

1610
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:37,931
Now, baby, I know you've been
doing everything for everybody,

1611
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,275
all your life.

1612
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,896
I know this because you
take care of me, I know this.

1613
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,448
But the only problem is
with this situation.

1614
01:00:44,482 --> 01:00:46,137
You cannot
plan that baby's life.

1615
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:48,068
Mama... Have you ever... Uh-uh.

1616
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:51,206
Have you ever asked her one time
what does she wanna really do?

1617
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:52,827
No.I did not pick nursing.

1618
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,068
You are not hearing anything
I... Mom, this is my life.

1619
01:00:55,103 --> 01:00:56,586
I'm listening to you. This is my life!

1620
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,862
It's mine,
I have to live it my way.

1621
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:01,172
All right, all right, okay.

1622
01:01:01,206 --> 01:01:03,413
Lord have mercy...

1623
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:05,896
That's a lot of grown-folk
talk for somebody

1624
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:07,206
living under my roof. Living under my roof.

1625
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:09,793
No, don't... don't...
don't mock me, girl.

1626
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:11,931
No, ma'am, no, ma'am, no, ma'am.

1627
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:15,103
Last time I checked, I pay all
the bills up in here.

1628
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:18,862
All the bills in this house:
electric, gas, everything.

1629
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:20,551
And I don't get
no help from nobody,

1630
01:01:20,586 --> 01:01:22,620
and as long as you're
in my house

1631
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:25,827
and I'm making sacrifices,
Emily, that I can't afford,

1632
01:01:25,862 --> 01:01:28,034
you will abide by my rules.

1633
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:29,172
I didn't break
any of your rules.

1634
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:31,241
I promised you if you
stayed in school

1635
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,620
and you went to church,
I would support you,

1636
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,517
but now you're skipping school,
you don't come to church,

1637
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:37,620
you ain't singing in choir
rehearsal.

1638
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,068
I only missed
one choir rehearsal!

1639
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:40,413
I don't know what's going on.

1640
01:01:40,448 --> 01:01:42,137
Uh-uh, you've missed more
than one choir rehearsal.

1641
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:44,379
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm telling you,

1642
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:47,034
if you got a change
of plans and you're so grown,

1643
01:01:47,068 --> 01:01:48,448
you wanna do it your way,

1644
01:01:48,482 --> 01:01:52,379
you're gonna do it your way,
in your own place.

1645
01:01:52,413 --> 01:01:53,896
Come on, now.

1646
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:55,862
Come on.
Yes, ma'am.

1647
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:57,689
Yes, ma'am,
I might just do that.

1648
01:01:57,724 --> 01:01:59,034
No, no. I didn't hear you.

1649
01:01:59,068 --> 01:02:00,689
What's you say? I said, I might
just do that.

1650
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:02,931
Come on, let's pray, come on.
Oh, don't might do it, honey.

1651
01:02:02,965 --> 01:02:05,000
Mm-mmm, don't might do it.

1652
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:07,793
Do it with all your might!

1653
01:02:07,827 --> 01:02:09,482
All right, Maya,
that's enough, that's enough!

1654
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,551
No, Mama!

1655
01:02:10,586 --> 01:02:12,068
I'm not through talking to you!

1656
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:12,965
You are not...

1657
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,310
[ALL SHOUTING]

1658
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:17,034
Let her go, Mama, let her go.

1659
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:19,068
Oh, my God.
Bad decisions!

1660
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:21,482
And disrespectful.

1661
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:24,379
I never talked to
you like that, Mama.

1662
01:02:24,413 --> 01:02:26,931
You didn't allow it

from the Colombians.

1732
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:57,275
But nobody can give you
a better deal, bro.

1733
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,310
I have a shipment
coming in tonight.

1734
01:06:04,689 --> 01:06:05,896
My man.

1735
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:08,310
Yeah.

1736
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:10,103
All right, we'll talk later.

1737
01:06:12,413 --> 01:06:14,517
What do you know?

1738
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:19,034
The two most powerful players in
the city are now joining forces.

1739
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:20,724
Yeah.

1740
01:06:20,758 --> 01:06:23,206
I'm gonna put 'em on my team.

1741
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:25,965
As soon as we get in good,

1742
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,862
I'm gonna
take over his operation.

1743
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:30,275
Hell yeah.

1744
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:33,482
Things are coming together
just as I planned, baby.

1745
01:06:33,517 --> 01:06:35,724
Matter of fact,
they couldn't be better.

1746
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,862
I got the whole damn city in
the palm of my hand.

1747
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:46,172
What do you think, baby?

1748
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:48,448
I think that there
is nothing sexier...

1749
01:06:50,793 --> 01:06:52,793
... than a black man
handling his business.

1750
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:53,793
This is big, baby.

1751
01:06:53,827 --> 01:06:55,620
This will put us on top.

1752
01:06:55,655 --> 01:06:58,068
My favorite position. Listen to you.

1753
01:06:58,103 --> 01:07:01,172
You sure don't sound like my
same little innocent Emily.

1754
01:07:01,206 --> 01:07:04,275
I had an amazing teacher. That's true.

1755
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,724
Come to bed,
I wanna show you something.

1756
01:07:05,758 --> 01:07:07,103
Not right now, baby,
I got work to do.

1757
01:07:07,137 --> 01:07:08,862
Not right now, baby.

1758
01:07:08,896 --> 01:07:12,655
Chill out,
stop being so damn thirsty.

1759
01:07:12,689 --> 01:07:15,827
I told you, we got a lot
of work to do.

1760
01:07:15,862 --> 01:07:17,827
So you wanna be down,
you wanna be on the team,

1761
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:20,103
I need to know that you're
ready to prove it.

1762
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,448
I need to know
that I can trust you, baby,

1763
01:07:22,482 --> 01:07:23,517
because if it's you and me,

1764
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:25,000
it's you and me
against the world.

1765
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:26,620
Jacob...

1766
01:07:26,655 --> 01:07:29,793
I will never, ever betray you.

1767
01:07:29,827 --> 01:07:31,689
Is that right?
That's right.

1768
01:07:34,068 --> 01:07:37,206
Okay.

1769
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,275
But look here.

1770
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,206
I need you to...

1771
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:43,965
get close to him.

1772
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,344
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1773
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:48,103
Yeah, but, baby...

1774
01:07:48,137 --> 01:07:49,172
Ow!

1775
01:07:49,206 --> 01:07:51,862
There are no "buts" in life.

1776
01:07:51,896 --> 01:07:54,034
It's do or die.
Okay.

1777
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:58,310
Now, I'm gonna ask you
again... nicely.

1778
01:07:58,344 --> 01:08:01,000
Baby, do you understand?

1779
01:08:01,034 --> 01:08:04,000
Yes, yes, I'll do whatever!

1780
01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:06,344
That's my angel.

1781
01:08:06,379 --> 01:08:08,379

for a life of no limits

by any means necessary,

1783
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:11,827
and you can be
a part of that, baby.

1784
01:08:19,033 --> 01:08:22,655
You know, I've given it
a lot of thought

1785
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:27,792
and I have decided that...

1786
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:29,620
I don't want any of it.

1787
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:33,033
Hey, hey, hey.

1788
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:36,931
Come here.

1789
01:08:36,965 --> 01:08:38,379
Come here.

1790
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:46,241
Acting like that.

1791
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,585
Listen to me.

1792
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:53,413
I don't want any of it
without you by my side.

1793
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:59,655
Jacob, I love the sound of that.

1794
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,172
Angel.

1795
01:09:01,206 --> 01:09:02,758
Yes, Jacob?

1797
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,241
My goodness,
that's so beautiful.

1798
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:14,379
What does it mean?

1799
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,309
"The measure of your love

1800

is only equal to that
of your loyalty."

1801
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:25,309
I can trust you, right? Of course.

1802
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:28,585
I got something for you.

1803
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,758
What?

1804
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:35,792
It's gonna make you
feel real good.

1805
01:09:39,965 --> 01:09:41,206
Just...

1806
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:42,379
Just take it.

1807
01:09:42,413 --> 01:09:43,620
Okay.

1809
01:09:49,965 --> 01:09:51,482
Yeah.

1810
01:09:51,517 --> 01:09:56,448
[EMILY] I was fast becoming the
number-one girl at The Sapphire.

1811
01:09:56,482 --> 01:09:58,344
I was in love with the crowd

1812
01:09:58,379 --> 01:10:01,448
and they were in love
with me and I...

1813
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:04,344
I loved Jacob.

1814
01:10:04,379 --> 01:10:05,689
Mmm.

1815
01:10:05,724 --> 01:10:10,344
I would do any and everything
to make my baby happy.

1816
01:10:10,379 --> 01:10:13,068
Jacob and I had some big plans,

1817
01:10:13,103 --> 01:10:14,931
but we would soon find out

1818
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:17,827
that we weren't the only ones
making plans.
