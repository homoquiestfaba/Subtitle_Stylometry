T-minus 15, 14, 13.

00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:14,252
T-minus 10, nine, eight,

00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:17,522
seven, six, five,

00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:18,523
four...

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,926
Main engine starts.

6
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,932
[rock music plays]

7
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,136
[speaking Russian]

8
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:44,276
-Boo! -Ah!

9
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:46,478
[laughing]

10
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:30,422
[alarm blares]

11
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,760
Speak English, they won’t understand you.

12
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,361
Now, go. Go!

13
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:51,810
[screaming]

14
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,379
[roaring]

15
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:11,963
[screaming]

16
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:25,076
We can’t let these monsters escape!

17
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:26,478
Once they get into the ocean,

18
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:28,246
it’s over, they’ll be unstoppable.

19
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:31,016
This is the only way to end it for good.

20
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,351
Ah!

21
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:34,619
What have we done?

22
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:36,087
Let’s go, it can be fixed!

23
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,496
[screams]

24
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:56,908
They’re coming, they’re coming!

25
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,589
I don’t know how to work this thing, do you?

26
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,124
Don’t you remember your Cosmonaut training?

27
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:14,392
Turn on the engines and hit the gas!

28
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,961
[banging]

29
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:17,362
Figure it out, Sergei!

30
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,064
They’re about the break through!

31
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,735
Sergei, hurry up! There’s more coming!

32
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,371
Once we hit ten thousand meters, they’ll have no oxygen.

33
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:28,373
Hurry up, they’re almost in!

34
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:32,644
Nearly there!

35
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,645
Sergei!

36
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,046
I think I got it!

37
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:36,848
I can’t overload it, but I can launch it!

38
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,251
One minute starting now!

39
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:42,153
I need more time, I need more time!

40
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,656
I’ll give you more time.

41
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,492
No, Aloysha! Come back!

42
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,194
Okay.

43
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,431
[roaring]

44
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:10,315
[Sergei] Aloysha!

45
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:13,652
[Sergei] Aloysha!

46
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,690
No!

47
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:23,962
[sighs]

48
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:16,047
Check main booster, propellant diagnostics are green.

49
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,750
Gyro navigation systems are online.

50
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:21,619
Orbital stabilization thrusters purged and ready.

51
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,355
This is Tabula Rasa to mission control,

52
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,923
final walkthrough complete.

53
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,725
All systems running at 100 percent.

54
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,494
We have confirmed "go" for launch by all parties.

55
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:32,030
T-minus nine minutes and counting.

56
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:33,398
Roger that, mission control.

57
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,733
Engineer Gilmour, what’s our status?

58
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:38,069
Green across the board, Commander, and...

59
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,838
and...

60
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:44,142
ooh, oh, wow, I think I shouldn’t have had those tacos.

61
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,011
I told you not to trust that food truck.

62
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:48,013
I think it’s something else.

63
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,814
Gilmour?

64
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,250
I’ll just do a couple of tests.

65
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,055
I’m just gonna touch here.

66
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,056
Ah!

67
00:06:58,123 --> 00:06:58,857
Ah, ah!

68
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:00,225
We got a possible appendicitis.

69
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,226
No, no, no...

70
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:02,694
Captain...

71
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,596
-It’s just... mm. -She’s not clear to fly.

72
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,098
Mission control, Engineer Gilmour

73
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,599
has fallen ill and needs medical attention.

74
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,134
We need to delay the launch.

75
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,769
No can do, Commander.

76
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:13,205
Delaying the launch would set us back six months.

77
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:14,439
That’s going to be a huge setback

78
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,074
that we can’t handle.

79
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:20,012
We will alert the alternate. He’s standing by.

80
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,246
Shit.

81
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:42,701
Commander Tress, alternate astronaut is en route.

82
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:45,304
Tabula Rasa, start auxiliary power units

83
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,305
and activate APUs.

84
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,741
APUs on.

85
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:52,711
Felt like this day would never come.

86
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:54,313
We are finally going to the moon.

87
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,851
As long as the alternate shows up.

88
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:05,591
Arming solid rocket booster

89
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:06,592
Sequence ready.

90
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,027
Arm and safe devices a go.

91
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:11,396
The alternate should be joining you in a minute.

92
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,899
SRBs and devices clear.

93
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,734
I know none of us are happy about it,

94
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,803
but he’s the best at what he does...

95
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:20,238
maybe even better than Gilmour.

96
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:22,674
We can’t delay this mission another six months.

97
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:26,678
Howdy, boss.

98
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,513
Prepped and ready to go to the moon.

99
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,917
I hear the commute is a killer.

100
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,352
Michael, for the last time,

101
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,320
I’m not your boss, I’m your commander.

102
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,122
Roger that, Commander.

103
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,291
Begin aero surface profile test.

104
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:44,963
Aero profile surface test activated, Commanderino.

105
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:50,402
Mission control, profile test complete.

106
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:51,770
Copy.

107
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,139
Proceed with main engine gimbal profile test.

108
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:57,042
Retract the gaseous vent arm.

109
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,877
Michael, please take this seriously.

110
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:01,413
This mission is far too important to humanity, got it?

111
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,882
You don’t have to worry about me, Commander

112
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,384
I’m here to work.

113
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,152
Commander, power status.

114
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,990
Power is running at 100 percent, no alarms.

115
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,359
Transferring communication module power from ground

116
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,794
to internal.

117
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:19,231
Activating launchpad sound suppression system.

118
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:23,802
Activating main engine burn-off in T-minus 10.

119
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,671
Copy. Guidance is internal.

120
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,072
We will begin ground launch sequencer

121
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,607
for auto sequence start.

122
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:29,975
We are still go.

123
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,944
T-minus 27 seconds and counting, Commander.

124
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,813
Roger that, mission control.

125
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:37,416
Everyone ready to go to the moon?

126
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:41,920
Oh shoot...

127
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:43,488
What is it, Michael?

128
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:45,190
I think I left my stove on.

129
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,462
Remind me to not leave you alone in the galley.

130
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,299
Luckily, NASA has ensured this ship

131
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,501
is mitigated against all excessive heat forms,

132
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,004
just so long as we don’t land in the Compton Belkovich

133
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:00,472
volcanic complex on the far side,

134
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:03,809
we should be safe, even from Liam’s cooking.

135
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,077
[chuckling]

136
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:11,516
Ten, nine, eight,

137
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,851
seven...

138
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,586
Starting main engine.

139
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:16,555
six, five,

140
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,924
four, three,

141
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,393
two, one.

142
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,129
Godspeed, Tabula Rasa.

143
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:25,330
Roger that, mission control.

144
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:26,631
Ignition.

145
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,166
Liftoff.

146
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,506
[cheering]

147
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:54,793
There’s the thermosphere.

148
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,500
Now for the exosphere.

149
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,443
Wow.

150
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,844
[sighs]

151
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:16,081
Mission Control to Tabula Rasa.

152
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:17,749
That is a successful launch.

153
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:20,085
I repeat, a successful launch.

154
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,021
Woo!

155
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:28,560
Current navigation track to the moon appears clear

156
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,696
and artificial gravity magnification is complete.

157
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,131
Roger that, mission control.

158
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,433
Tom, confirm navigation settings.

159
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,837
Navigation settings confirmed.

160
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:43,875
ETA to the moon, 68 hours, 42 minutes, and 15 seconds.

161
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:46,111
That tracks with our settings.

162
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,847
Signing off for now, but will continue to monitor.

163
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:50,949
Congratulations, Tabula Rasa.

164
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,052
Nice work, everyone.

165
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,120
Now the real work begins.

166
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:57,789
Gravity normalizers engaged.

167
00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:00,192
All right, I’ll be in the galley making popcorn,

168
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:01,359
if anybody needs something.

169
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:05,430
-[laughing] -What? C’mon.

170
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,508
How’s it looking? Everything still on schedule?

171
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:17,776
Uh, sure...

172
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,612
just trying to make a renewable source of energy

173
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,248
that will support generations of thousands of people

174
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:26,318
living on the moon, no big deal.

175
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:29,054
If anyone can make this fuel work, it’s you.

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,323
You led the team that discovered what,

177
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,825
a thousand new uses for algae?

178
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:35,260
What’s one more, right?

179
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,662
Thanks, Commander, that means a lot.

180
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,037
You know, my dad keeps saying if we’re successful,

181
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,940
they’ll have towns on the moon named after us soon enough.

182
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:51,309
Think about it...

183
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,844
Adams City.

184
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,112
Tressburg.

185
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,048
Don’t go looking for condos just yet.

186
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,083
Go for Commander Tress.

187
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:59,784
Go for Tress.

188
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:03,188
Commander, we have a bit of electromagnetic disturbance,

189
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,457
probably due to the Van Allen radiation belt.

190
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:07,158
It’s nothing out of the ordinary, but...

191
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:08,760
What does that mean?

192
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:11,229
We’ve been on a bit of a run, but we should be fine.

193
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:13,465
But we’ll have to adjust our landing by a degree.

194
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:16,067
But we should still be able to land in the West Crater.

195
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:18,503
Keep an eye on it.

196
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,704
Let Ellie and mission control know right away.

197
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,373
Henri and Michael as well.

198
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,475
Copy, we’re having trouble reaching out to mission control

199
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,911
due to the interference, but I’ll keep trying.

200
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,646
Roger that.

201
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,314
I’m about to go on my sleep shift, but don’t hesitate

202
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,583
to wake me the second anything changes.

203
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,588
Are we okay, Commander?

204
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,290
Be ready for anything.

205
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:39,991
I’m gonna get some shut-eye.

206
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:41,426
I suggest you do the same.

207
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,595
It’ll be all hands once we make our approach.

208
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,297
Sounds good, Commander.

209
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,444
Quequio satellite sighted.

210
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,815
Navigation holding steady?

211
00:14:03,882 --> 00:14:08,486
Yes, current descent is only 46 feet from our initial site.

212
00:14:08,553 --> 00:14:10,722
Final run-through at 100 percent,

213
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,993
confirmed by Michael, Henri, and yours truly.

214
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,661
Come in, Commander Tress,

215
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:19,764
we are ready to initiate orbital lunar descent.

216
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,700
Confirmed.

217
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,735
Tabula Rasa Crew, report to command module

218
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,303
for initial orbital lunar descent

219
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,305
in T-minus 5 minutes and counting.

220
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,378
Go back, go back!

221
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:34,479
Whoa...

222
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:36,948
Everyone, get your asses up here, now!

223
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,316
[alarm blares]

224
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:44,522
Status report.

225
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:46,858
Commander, we are reading that you are veering off-course

226
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,361
by 24.2 degrees, please advise.

227
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:54,966
We’re not getting back on-course.

228
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,935
Mission control, we had some interference from the Van Allen,

229
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:58,536
but we course-corrected.

230
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:00,071
There’s no way it’s causing this much interference.

231
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:02,574
Copy, Tabula Rasa.

232
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,575
We suggest, uh...

233
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:04,976
[static]

234
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:06,177
Hello?

235
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,580
Hello, mission control, do you copy?

236
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,151
Mission control, I repeat, do you copy?

237
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,352
We lost them.

238
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,787
Henri, Michael, we need a diagnostic

239
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,889
of the electrical components of the nav system.

240
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:20,258
-On it. -Copy, boss.

241
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:27,165
The hardware’s fried, the system’s completely overloaded.

242
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:30,635
Something’s scrambling the computer to continually reset.

243
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,871
My electromagnetic readings are off the charts.

244
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:36,074
Interference shouldn’t increase exponentially like this.

245
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:43,581
I’m not getting control, we need to do something, now.

246
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:44,582
Restart the ship.

247
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,550
What?

248
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,118
We should regain emergency control.

249
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,753
Oxygen and gravity are on separate systems,

250
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,788
so those should hold.

251
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:50,855
Captain, that’s insane.

252
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,357
But Commander, we have no time.

253
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:54,259
We’ll be propelled to the far side

254
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:55,693
in T-minus 95 seconds.

255
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,629
It’s either this, or we crash and explode.

256
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,230
Restart the ship.

257
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:24,389
She’s holding.

258
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:26,191
She’s holding.

259
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,863
Wait... navigation’s not course-correcting.

260
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,631
Sixty seconds till we’re flung to the far side.

261
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:35,467
We need to manually maneuver the ship.

262
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:38,937
Michael, can you slow us down by adjusting the rocket boosters?

263
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:41,573
I can keep us flying long enough to not go "kaboom."

264
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,575
We’ll be flung to the far side of the moon before then.

265
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,577
If that happens we need to get

266
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:47,178
as close as possible to the Von Kármán crater.

267
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:48,413
We can use parts from the Chang’e-4 lander

268
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,281
and Yutu-2 rover to fix the ship.

269
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,451
Michael, Henri, adjust the rockets, slow us down.

270
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:56,287
On it.

271
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,556
When we land, we can use the Quequio relay satellite

272
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,091
to make contact.

273
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:02,894
That’s the only thing on the far side that can reach Earth.

274
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,929
Assuming we land in one piece.

275
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,534
Okay.

276
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,105
Anything?

277
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,573
It’s not working.

278
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:25,283
That was the satellite.

279
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,985
We won’t be able to contact mission control.

280
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:29,220
That won’t matter if we don’t survive this landing.

281
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:31,189
Michael, Henri, the rockets.

282
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:33,358
Nothing yet, Commander.

283
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,361
Keep her as steady as possible.

284
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,862
Roger that, Commander.

285
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:46,304
It’s not working, we have to do it manually.

286
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:58,016
Anything?

287
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,918
It’s working.

288
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:02,187
[garbled transmission]

289
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:05,223
...right for the Chang’e 4!

290
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,891
Brace for impact!

291
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:11,429
[grunting]

292
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,577
Michael, Henri, are you okay?

293
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,281
All good, Commander.

294
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:43,561
We’re locked out of the systems.

295
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:49,801
We need to figure out a way to get back to Earth...

296
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,469
now.

297
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:58,409
Status report... is anyone hurt?

298
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,778
Negative, Commander, we’re all good here.

299
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:02,580
System says no hull breaches, either.

300
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:05,216
But that Chang’e 4 rover was our best chance

301
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:06,651
to communicate with mission control.

302
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:08,052
It doesn’t matter.

303
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,054
The satellite’s gone, and the only thing

304
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:13,157
on the far side of the moon that can communicate with Earth,

305
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:14,626
we destroyed.

306
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:17,395
I’ll never see my dad again.

307
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:20,031
We won’t see anyone again.

308
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:22,200
Mission control knows we crashed on the far side.

309
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,335
If they don’t hear from us in the next few hours,

310
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:26,571
the best they can try to do any time soon

311
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:27,905
will be to figure out a way to communicate.

312
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:29,574
But that could take days or longer,

313
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,943
especially without the Quequio satellite.

314
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,444
We’re all alive.

315
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:36,447
We need to assess and see what’s available, and for how long.

316
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:39,250
We’ll probably have to get back on our own.

317
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:40,685
Of course.

318
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:42,353
Tom, Henri, status report?

319
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,823
We’ve lost most of our power.

320
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,260
Owen, please tell me life support is still functional.

321
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:50,328
Okay, okay...

322
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:51,529
Um...

323
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,532
we should be okay on oxygen.

324
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,267
We have enough in reserve to last six months.

325
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,704
Our food source is supposed to mimic that as well.

326
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:02,073
We are equipped to grow vegetation,

327
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,776
so we should get some fresh food if we’re here for a while.

328
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,611
And so long as there aren’t any hull breaches

329
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:08,680
and no one opens any doors or windows,

330
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:11,349
we should be able to maintain a moderate temperature

331
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,618
inside the modules for months.

332
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:16,821
And if there aren’t any leaks, we’ll be fine.

333
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:19,090
I’ll do a walkthrough, then a moonwalk,

334
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:21,125
to ensure there’s no external damage.

335
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:24,162
See? We’re all safe.

336
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,597
How far away are we from the Yutu-2 rover?

337
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,701
Rough estimate, about a mile.

338
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,837
Is there any way to contact mission control from the Yutu-2?

339
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:35,807
No, the only way to reach Earth from the far side

340
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,475
was through the Quequio relay satellite.

341
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:40,378
Which we destroyed.

342
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:41,846
Exactly.

343
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:44,015
So, Michael, Henri, you’re coming with me

344
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:47,418
to retrieve whatever components we can from the Yutu-2 rover,

345
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,687
use it to get Tabula Rasa up and running,

346
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:51,589
at least to the near side, so we can make contact.

347
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:53,057
I’m coming too.

348
00:20:53,124 --> 00:20:54,826
The Yutu-2 houses several spectrometers.

349
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:56,694
I could pull a whole one or scavenge it for parts.

350
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,696
No, if it’s operational, we’ll drive it back here.

351
00:20:58,763 --> 00:20:59,697
You can get what you need from it then.

352
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:01,399
And what if it’s not?

353
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:04,502
Then we’ll be missing out on potentially life-saving tech.

354
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:07,138
Fine.

355
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:09,173
Ellie, I need the rest of you to take stock

356
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,408
of all the damage you can find.

357
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:11,743
Make sure all supplies and experiments

358
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:12,744
are still operational, and if possible,

359
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,512
chart a course back home.

360
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,414
We’ll need every bit of oxygen, water,

361
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:17,849
and sustenance accounted for.

362
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,350
We could be here for a while.

363
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,085
We’re on it, Commander.

364
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:22,720
And Josie, make sure the life support module

365
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:24,055
is fully operational.

366
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:26,190
If that breaks, we have no chance of going back.

367
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,259
Copy, Commander.

368
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:31,429
All right, team, let’s suit up.

369
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:47,712
All right, it’s at least a 20-minute hike.

370
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,381
Everyone keep an eye on your vitals.

371
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:52,717
-Copy that, Commander. -Copy.

372
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:54,852
Copy that, Commander.

373
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,120
Follow me.

374
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:02,193
Come on, guys, we’re the first humans

375
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,730
to set foot on the far side of the moon.

376
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:09,033
Guys, we’re a part of history no matter what now.

377
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:20,144
Stupid things!

378
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,285
Did you see that?

379
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:28,586
See what?

380
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:31,255
I don’t know, it looked Cyrillic...

381
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:32,757
Russian, maybe.

382
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:35,493
Russian? That’s odd.

383
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,628
If anything, we probably picked up

384
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,664
some Chinese characters from the Yutu-2.

385
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,766
No, no, no, it for sure wasn’t that.

386
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,768
Let me see if I can get it pulled back up.

387
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:45,603
We have more important things to do.

388
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,138
Come on, can we finish this walkthrough?

389
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,873
Fine.

390
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:06,557
Well, Liam, it appears to be working.

391
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:09,794
Aren’t you glad I came, Commander?

392
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:11,496
Okay, let’s take what we need and head back.

393
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:14,665
The less of our oxygen reserves we use out here, the better.

394
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,034
Jackpot.

395
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,172
Oh, shoot.

396
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:24,108
What is it, Liam?

397
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,209
Bloody nose.

398
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,311
I hit my face pretty bad during the crash.

399
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:30,014
Liam, have Owen check you out the second we get back.

400
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:37,221
Captain, I think you should see this.

401
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:47,365
A volcanic reaction?

402
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:48,866
Unlikely...

403
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,334
nothing under the moon should cause ripples like that.

404
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:53,004
The moon has magma, but no active volcanoes.

405
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,373
Even if we’re under a magma chamber, there’s no way.

406
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,041
Tracks?

407
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:59,777
From what, a giant moon snake?

408
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,213
The rover?

409
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:06,817
No, tire tread doesn’t match.

410
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,758
Back to the ship, leave the rover!

411
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:22,233
What are those?

412
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,901
Sharks?

413
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:53,497
Why are there sharks on the moon?

414
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:55,066
Look, it’s not moving.

415
00:24:55,132 --> 00:24:57,301
I think someone must have set a trap.

416
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:00,972
Okay, but who set the trap?

417
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:06,310
Ah!

418
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,289
[speaks Russian]

419
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:31,002
How are they breathing?

420
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:33,304
Uh, I think they just spoke...

421
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:35,272
Russian?

422
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:40,578
First there were giant sharks, now there are Russians?

423
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:42,046
You think they’re friendly?

424
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,982
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

425
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:58,095
Americans...

426
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,033
Welcome to the moon!

427
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:17,782
For the record, this was not in the brochure.

428
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:23,387
I didn’t think it would be the Americans

429
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:27,158
who will lead my rescue operation, but how do you say...

430
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:31,262
beggars can’t be choosers.

431
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:33,698
A rescue mission?

432
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:35,199
Who are you?

433
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:37,301
You weren’t sent here to rescue me?

434
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:41,005
After 40 years on the moon,

435
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:44,909
I assumed somebody would want to bring me back!

436
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:47,378
[speaks Russian]

437
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:54,018
Papa, we’re going to get you back home.

438
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:56,654
Don’t give up hope.

439
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,255
What is the point?

440
00:26:58,322 --> 00:27:00,558
I’m an old man, I’ve literally watched the world

441
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:04,395
pass me by more times than I can remember.

442
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:05,863
Maybe...

443
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,465
maybe it’s time to assume...

444
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:12,403
actually, to accept that no one is coming.

445
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,604
Don’t say that.

446
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:15,372
Yes, she’s right.

447
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,675
We’re more than happy to bring you back with us, both of you.

448
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,810
We just need to fix our ship first.

449
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:22,847
See, Papa? We’re going home.

450
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:37,895
What is up with her back?

451
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:39,864
Michael, stop. They just saved us.

452
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,805
I’m... I’m sorry.

453
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:52,476
Okay, let me officially introduce ourselves.

454
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:55,579
My name is Sergei, and this is Akula.

455
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:00,050
And she’s my daughter...

456
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:03,354
Adopted daughter.

457
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,257
I’m sorry, I...

458
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:07,691
No problem.

459
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:12,363
But hey, if you ever will try to touch my daughter again,

460
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,331
I will make the arrangement to send you back home

461
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:16,367
in a plastic bag, you understood?

462
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,105
Look, I’m sorry about my crewmate.

463
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:23,941
We can take you back to Earth with us,

464
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,744
but first we need to know who you really are,

465
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:28,012
and what you’re doing here.

466
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:30,347
There’s no time for it.

467
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:32,683
The hybrids can return any moment.

468
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,153
I have a rover just towards this ledge, let’s go.

469
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,456
Good, I can guide you back to my ship.

470
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:40,958
Are you sure it’s a good idea to have them

471
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:42,293
bring us to their ship?

472
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,562
We may be followed, and their ship

473
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:47,164
is our best bet to get off this stupid rock.

474
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:48,966
Mm.

475
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,901
Good looking forward.

476
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:53,070
Okay, change of the plans.

477
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:56,040
Now we go to our base and gather our supplies,

478
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:58,309
and when it’s safe, we return to your ship

479
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,946
and figure out how we can get back to Earth.

480
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,981
Last I checked, I was the commander here.

481
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:06,283
I need to get back to my ship.

482
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,486
Well, we either all go to my ship

483
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:14,325
and wipe them off your trail, or we go separate ways.

484
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:16,260
They will follow you, find you,

485
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:19,029
kill you and every member of your crew.

486
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:21,465
Does it still sound like a good idea to you?

487
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:26,203
Fine, lead the way...

488
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,438
for now.

489
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:43,554
Quickly, get on. They’re not far.

490
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:46,857
I’m sorry it’s a tight fit, I wasn’t expecting guests.

491
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,325
Okay, come on, guys, make some room.

492
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:49,460
Come on.

493
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,129
Ah!

494
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,965

495
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:56,967
Hurry! Drive, we have to save him!

496
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:58,135
What are you waiting for, let’s go!

497
00:29:58,202 --> 00:30:00,437
They will lead us into a trap.

498
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:02,573
If they were going to kill him, they would have done so.

499
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,375
If they’re not gonna kill him, what are they doing?

500
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:07,211
They’re taking him hostage.

501
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:09,480
I have to warn my crew.

502
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,547
No, you don’t.

503
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:12,182
Get off me, I have to warn my crew!

504
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:13,317
I’m not gonna let them die!

505
00:30:13,384 --> 00:30:14,718
If you don’t want them to die,

506
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:16,553
then don’t talk to them over the radio.

507
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,689
The electromagnetic waves will lead sharks

508
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:20,991
straight to your ship, and to your crew.

509
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:23,160
They won’t get a chance.

510
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:28,232
We have to save Henri.

511
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,334
I’m not leaving another member of my crew.

512
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:33,304
And we will, but going in there now, unprepared,

513
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,073
with what you’re wearing, is a suicide mission.

514
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,741
We will get supplies at our base.

515
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:49,253
Where’s my helmet?

516
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,754
How can I breathe down here?

I am Tzarina Selah.

520
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,698
I’m sure you have questions.

521
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,102
So do I.

522
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:50,681
Quickly, no time to lose.

523
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,654
Welcome to my abode.

524
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:07,231
It’ll take your body a minute to adjust to the oxygen

filling the ship from my algea crop.

526
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,236
You can take off your masks then.

527
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:28,385
So, now, we can talk.

528
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,861
Okay, I got one question.

529
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:41,131
How are you still alive?

530
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:46,670
Okay, I have some serious questions.

531
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:50,474
Why doesn’t she need a suit?

532
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,675
Or oxygen?

533
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:54,278
I knew there was something "fishy" about her.

534
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:55,779
He was right.

535
00:32:57,281 --> 00:32:58,415
I’m one of them.

Created to survive in all conditions.

Man, this day just keeps getting weirder and weirder.

538
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:18,168

539
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,404
She was absolutely healthy...

540

hungry, but healthy.

541
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:26,076
He saved my life, raised me as his own,

542
00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:27,578
and taught me everything he knows.

543
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:30,247
I grew up listening to his homeland’s music,

544
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:33,150
and reading the books of his people.

545
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:36,353
The ship had a fine audio system.

546

Thank God for Tchaikovsky,

"Swan Lake" was the only thing

548
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:42,926
that could put me to sleep as a child.

549
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:44,261
Have you heard of it?

550
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,662
Yes, we’ve heard of "Swan Lake."

551
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:49,733
It’s a classic back on Earth.

552
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,569
But I’m actually a rock and roll guy, you know?

553
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:55,272
But I was not able to put my hands on it.

554
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:57,474
I even saw Elton in Moscow, in...

555
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,409
Wait, wait, you saw... you saw Elton John?

556
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:01,512
Yes, this thing was the best one, eh?

557
00:34:01,578 --> 00:34:03,614
Can we get back on topic, please?

558
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:10,187
Okay, as much as her music taste,

559
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:12,589
Akula became better than me in many respects.

560
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:17,327
She even made some devices I wasn’t able to survive without.

561
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:19,396
So, speaking of...

562
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:23,667
here, upgraded suits.

563
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:29,606
They were my prototype, but they still work.

564
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:32,409
They block body heat and electromagnetic frequencies,

565
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,645
rendering us invisible to them.

566
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:36,413
While keeping your own body heat

567
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,550
to protect you from the frigid moon’s temperatures.

568
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:42,386
They also utilize an infrared communicator,

569
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:45,689
which converts sound to be undetectable.

570
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:48,325
And the oxygen?

571
00:34:48,392 --> 00:34:50,093
Same like hybrids...

572
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,828
I convert my own.

573
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:56,867
So, they able to have it by consume algae they harvest,

574
00:34:56,934 --> 00:35:00,804
and I able to extract it from the containers I grow them in.

575
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:04,074
So, that’s why my ship is full of oxygen,

576
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:10,013
and I put some on my back, you know, in my suit.

577
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,181
Like a makeshift oxygen tank.

578
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:12,649
Yes.

579
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:16,253
Impressive, but why are there hybrid sharks on the moon

580
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,521
in the first place?

581
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:22,426
Well, I was a very young scientist,

582
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,828
but always dreamed to become a cosmonaut.

583
00:35:24,895 --> 00:35:27,898
"The great gig in the sky," I always told myself.

584
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:31,902
But we had a better and straight goal

585
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,103
from the government...

586
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,839
we have to declare the moon Soviet property.

587
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:38,408
You had just left your footprint on it,

588
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:40,744
and we were going to build cities.

589
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:46,617
So, our government created these sharks, these hybrids,

590
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:51,021
to become Cold War weapons against the United States.

591
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:55,092
So, my colleague and I lured them on the rocket

592
00:35:55,158 --> 00:36:00,163
to make sure they wouldn’t invade Earth.

593
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,032
But you’re the only one here.

594
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,433
What happened to the other guy?

595
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,404
He sacrificed himself so that I could live.

596
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:13,076
Sergei, I’m so sorry.

597
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:16,613
How did you manage to survive so long?

598
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,083
Well, the ship was filled with experiments.

599
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,485
I was able to grow my own food,

600
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:23,754
collect evaporated water from plants,

601
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,292
and algae helped me to survive.

602
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:30,627
We found water, drilled underground.

603
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:32,996
It’s not very good, but we survive.

604
00:36:33,063 --> 00:36:35,232
Look, I hate to break up this Q and A,

605
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:39,903
but a man is being tortured by giant shark people.

606
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,272
Michael’s right, every second we’re here

607
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:44,107
is a second we’re not saving Henri.

608
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:48,612
Where did they take him?

609
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,447
The hybrids developed a settlement

610
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:52,115
inside the largest crater in the area.

611
00:36:52,182 --> 00:36:55,218
He’s likely being held there.

612
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:56,553
We need to get there now.

613
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,854
Henri’s our mechanic.

614
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:01,458
We can’t repair the ship without him.

615
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:02,826
Let’s boogie.

616
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:06,430
The sharks are probably off our trail by now.

617
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:12,569
We need to try and communicate with the ship.

618
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:14,571
We need to warn the crew at all costs.

619
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:17,774
They need to avoid using anything electromagnetic.

620
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:20,711
I think you’re right.

621
00:37:20,777 --> 00:37:22,079
Don’t let them see me.

622
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:25,949
Hey, you saw Elton John?

623
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:29,252
Man, I’ve been trying, never got a chance to.

624
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:30,854
Ellie.

625
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:33,323
Ellie, if you can hear this, do not respond...

626
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,125
I repeat, do not respond.

627
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:37,594
The ship is in danger of being attacked.

628
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:42,866
Any luck restoring electricity to the ship?

629
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,135
Not yet.

630
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:48,305
I repeat, do not respond using anything electromagnetic.

631
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,540
It could draw them to the ship for an attack.

632
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:53,677
Come in... Commander? Commander Tress!

633
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:55,712
-It’s not safe. -Nicole!

634
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:03,420
What was that?

635
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,088
I don’t know.

636
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,823
What could be taking them so long?

637
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,558
It sounded like she was in trouble.

638
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,659
We have to go out after them.

639
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:11,194
What? No, no, no.

640
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:12,596
We were given explicit orders to remain on the ship.

641
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:14,998
Nicole put me in charge.

642
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:17,434
They should have been back by now, they’re not responding.

643
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:19,169
What if they’re hurt?

644
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:21,371
I need you to grab your medical gear and come with me.

645
00:38:21,438 --> 00:38:24,040
-But... -No buts!

646
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:27,844
Josie, Tom, continue running diagnostics.

647
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:31,648
Owen, we have a crew to find.

648
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:47,030
Ah... I swear, I don’t know where the ship is!

649
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:49,099
The crash took us so far off-course, I... I...

650
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,034
I just want your ship.

651
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,937
You and your crew can have everything we leave behind.

652
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,573
Build your little colony in peace.

653
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,775
We are going home.

654
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,076
Home?

655
00:39:00,143 --> 00:39:03,947
Yes, the mother planet to us both. Earth.

656
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:06,817
Wait, wait, wait... you’re from Earth?

657
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:12,823
Yes, I will rule there as I rule here.

658
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:16,593
Now tell me... where is your ship?

659
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,429
I... I can’t tell you.

660
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:22,532
That’s a shame. Scar!

661
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,374
Ah, my leg, ah!

662
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:34,578
Ah!

663
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,882
[screaming]

664
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:49,025
Now tell us, or die!

665
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,495
Okay. Okay. But you have to...

666
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:53,230
you have to promise me...

667
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:54,898
promise me you won’t hurt my crew.

668
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:59,769
On my honor as Tzarina, ruler of the Hybrid sharks.

669
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:08,044
Scar, prepare the guards We’re taking the ship.

670
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:09,679
[panting]

671
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:12,249
Ah!

672
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:21,992
Heh, if Elton John could see me now, right?

673
00:40:22,058 --> 00:40:24,861
Yeah, you’re a rocket man now.

674
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:31,434
What... what are these made of?

675
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,136
Sharpened moonstone...

676
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:35,672
the only thing sharp enough to pierce the sharks’ hides.

677
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:38,875
This stone has more crystalline structure,

678
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:41,511
and it’s hold sharp edge for extremely long time.

679
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:45,916
You two really have thought of everything, haven’t you?

680
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:49,019
When the alternative is death, you do what you can.

681
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:08,238
Okay, from now, we’d better go forward on foot.

682
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:11,241
We don’t want to let them know we’re coming.

683
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:12,909
Akula, lead the way.

684
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:22,953
It’s clear. This way... stay close.

685
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:32,829
Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you about

686
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:35,465
the booby trap you set when we met.

687
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,033
What about it?

688
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,369
I couldn’t help but notice that the hybrid shark,

689
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:42,172
when it was on its back, it stopped moving.

690
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,840
Why is that?

691
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:45,475
Tonic immobility...

692
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,277
when a shark is upside-down,

693
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:48,578
it cannot move,

694
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:52,782
and it’s about the only thing what can stop them.

695
00:41:54,117 --> 00:41:59,623
And how many sharks are out there, dozens, hundreds?

696
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:01,691
A few dozen.

697
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:03,393
Their leader, Tzarina Selah,

698
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,962
only allows the very strongest to hatch.

699
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:12,002
But even with her rules, automatic parthenogenesis

700
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:16,373
asexual reproduction, started to happen.

701
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,941
Nature finds a way.

702
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:32,122
And how do they just pick a few to survive?

703
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:34,591
Do they just let the weak ones die?

704
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:36,960
All the eggs are cryogenically frozen in the hopes

705
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:38,962
that they one day will have enough resources

706
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:40,697
to hatch them all.

707
00:42:40,764 --> 00:42:41,898
The ones that are allowed to be born,

708
00:42:41,965 --> 00:42:43,633
the best and the strongest,

709
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,102
are trying to protect the crater.

710
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:47,437
No wonder you weren’t chosen.

711
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:51,474
Everyone makes mistakes.

712
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,942
Now, quiet.

713
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:54,878
They can hear us.

714
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:25,542
Wow... they built a whole civilization.

715
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:30,714
Impressive, if they weren’t so terrifying.

716
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,082
Who would have thought sharks

717
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:34,317
would have colonized the moon before humans?

718
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:36,352
Half-shark, half-human.

719
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:37,387
All teeth?

720
00:43:37,454 --> 00:43:38,621
All violence... don’t forget that.

721
00:43:38,688 --> 00:43:40,156
Enough.

722
00:43:40,223 --> 00:43:43,393
Akula, where do we need to go to get into the prison?

723
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,862
The other side of that large building.

724
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:47,897
They don’t have heavy patrols there,

725
00:43:47,964 --> 00:43:49,532
they guard the front entrance.

726
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,902
If we go in through the back, we should have a clear shot.

727
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:55,638
You heard her.

728
00:43:55,705 --> 00:43:57,040
Let’s dance.

729
00:44:35,378 --> 00:44:36,813
[growls]

730
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:59,469
Follow me, and don’t get any blood on you.

731
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:10,046
Look what they were able to accomplish

732
00:45:10,113 --> 00:45:12,115
in only a few decades.

733
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:13,516
Yeah, it’s impressive, all right.

734
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,218
Too bad they’re all bloodthirsty killers

735
00:45:15,285 --> 00:45:16,986
who would rip your throat out if given the chance.

736
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:20,657
Of course, just makes me wish we had the chance

737
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:23,259
to actually do the mission we came here to do.

738
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:27,263
Well, if they could, we sure can.

739
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,166
These shark hybrids have only expansion

740
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,035
and aggressions in mind.

741
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:34,270
They never leave their guards down...

742
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:36,206
stay alert.

743
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,828
I don’t like this.

744
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:01,297
Something feels wrong.

745
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:02,565
We have to try.

746
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:05,034
These footprints are the only signs of them.

747
00:46:06,202 --> 00:46:08,504
Nicole would do the same for us.

748
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:11,007
I guess.

749
00:46:11,074 --> 00:46:14,978
It’s just spooky out here, on the far side.

750
00:46:18,248 --> 00:46:19,682
What’s that?

751
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:20,950
What?

752
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:22,151
I don’t know, it looks...

753
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:24,487
it looks like a piece of fabric,

754
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:26,956
maybe from one of the spacesuits.

755
00:46:38,635 --> 00:46:39,936
Oh, my God...

756
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,472
Liam.

757
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:47,610
And where’s Nicole, Michael, Henri?

758
00:46:47,677 --> 00:46:51,180
Come in, Commander, Michael, Henri, anybody...

759
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:52,615
we have a casualty!

760
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:00,256
Back to the ship... now!

761
00:47:02,892 --> 00:47:04,093
What do you think got Liam?

762
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,029
There’s nothing living on the moon!

763
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,631
Owen, you cut out for a second...

764
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,634
Owen?

765
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:13,436
Owen!

766
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,372
Owen!

767
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:27,050
Help!

768
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:53,743
[groaning]

769
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,311
[screaming]

770
00:48:02,185 --> 00:48:05,421
All right, if I take our location

771
00:48:05,488 --> 00:48:09,859
in conjunction with the moon’s rotation...

772
00:48:09,926 --> 00:48:12,261
there, we have our way home.

773
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:14,864
But...

774
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:17,500
But? But what?

775
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,435
We have to get this bucket of bolts off the ground

776
00:48:19,502 --> 00:48:21,704
and headed back to Earth in less than six hours.

777
00:48:21,771 --> 00:48:26,476
If we don’t, it’s another four weeks till the next window.

778
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,845
See if you can get in touch with Nicole.

779
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:30,046
Maybe she’s with Ellie by now.

780
00:48:32,048 --> 00:48:33,950
Commander Tress, this is Tom.

781
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:35,385
Come in, Commander.

782
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:37,253
You and the crew need to get back to the ship ASAP.

783
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,923
We only have a six-hour window to get home.

784
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,359
Commander Tress, come in.

785
00:48:44,794 --> 00:48:46,729
Nicole?

786
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:47,997
Ellie?

787
00:48:48,064 --> 00:48:50,133
Is anybody out there?

788
00:48:57,173 --> 00:48:59,642
If we get attacked, remember one rule...

789
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:03,346
if we draw blood, we draw attention.

790
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:06,282
But we’ve been cutting sharks all day.

791
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:09,052
Exactly... out there, where there is no atmosphere.

792
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:10,953
But here, they can smell anything.

793
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,389
And boy, they do love smell of blood.

794
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:24,400
God, it’s hot in here.

795
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:25,802
It’s safe to take it off.

796
00:49:28,771 --> 00:49:33,242
They hold prisoners at the back end of this building.

797
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:35,545
We have to be careful not to alert any patrols.

798
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:42,418
Should we take ’em down?

799
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:44,454
We have to avoid any conflicts.

800
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,722
We’re on hybrids territory now.

801
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:57,333
Looks like the hallway splits up ahead.

802
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,303
We’ll take the left, you guys go right.

803
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:11,280
Move out.

804
00:50:21,824 --> 00:50:23,960
The sooner we can get Henri back to our ship,

805
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:26,596
the sooner we can get out of here for good.

806
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:32,135
What do I do?

807
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:35,104
We only have one shot at this.

808
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:36,405
Follow my lead and take the low road.

809
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:39,242
-What? -Trust me!

810
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:41,577
Swing!

811
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:42,879
Lunge!

812
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:50,286
Stop!

813
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:52,355
We wanna keep him alive?

814
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:54,390
We draw blood, we draw attention, remember?

815
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:01,397
[speaking Russian]

816
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:13,309
He drew blood to alert the guards.

817
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:15,178
I knew we should have killed him.

818
00:51:15,244 --> 00:51:16,712
We have to get out of here, go.

819
00:51:16,779 --> 00:51:19,715
-Go, go, go! -Go, go, go!

820
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:23,719
Can’t risk it.

821
00:51:27,757 --> 00:51:28,724
We found Henri!

822
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,831
Henri, oh, my God.

823
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:37,033
I’m sorry, I...

824
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:38,634
I tried my best, but I just...

825
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:42,972
The ship, it’s not safe.

826
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:45,942
What are you talking about?

827
00:51:46,008 --> 00:51:49,979
The sharks, they’re gonna use the ship to get back to Earth.

828
00:51:50,046 --> 00:51:52,982
They have an army of eggs that they’re gonna hatch there.

829
00:51:55,618 --> 00:51:57,486
Earth has all the resources they need

830
00:51:57,553 --> 00:51:59,555
to become the dominant species.

831
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:00,756
Why wouldn’t they just use your ship?

832
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:03,659
Well, my ship is barely big enough

833
00:52:03,726 --> 00:52:05,461
just for Akula and myself.

834
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:07,163
We don’t have enough fuel to reach Earth,

835
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,800
and we operate off the Cold War time technology.

836
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,603
So, there is no way to plot a course.

837
00:52:13,669 --> 00:52:15,938
What about your ship?

838
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:19,375
We have to get back, now.

839
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:21,611
Michael, help Henri up.

840
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:23,412
Let’s get outta here.

841
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,881
[grunting]

842
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:30,620
Come on, this way.

843
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:36,792
Hurry!

844
00:52:48,971 --> 00:52:51,974
Quick! In here. They’re running the other way.

845
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:01,617
What are these?

846
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:08,758
Uh, guys?

847
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:11,927
These are hybrid shark eggs.

848
00:53:11,994 --> 00:53:14,530
This must be their incubation chamber.

849
00:53:14,597 --> 00:53:16,532
There are so many.

850
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:19,035
Earth would never stand a chance.

851
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:21,304
We should destroy them now.

852
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,005
No!

853
00:53:23,072 --> 00:53:24,540
Those are innocent children.

854
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,309
They haven’t done anything wrong.

855
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,610
Children?

856
00:53:27,677 --> 00:53:31,180
Those are monsters, killing machines.

857
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:34,283
From what I heard about humans, they’re not better.

858
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,486
Should we kill all the humans, too?

859
00:53:37,553 --> 00:53:38,921
If we stop them now,

860
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:41,090
we can prevent an invasion from ever happening.

861
00:53:41,157 --> 00:53:44,460
Those things have millions of soldiers stockpiled,

862
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:45,995
ready to attack at any minute.

863
00:53:46,062 --> 00:53:47,863
If we destroy them now,

864
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,967
it’ll take them decades to recover, if they ever do.

865
00:54:03,379 --> 00:54:04,814
They’re sounding an alarm!

866
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,482
We’ve lingered here too long.

867
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:08,084
We have to get out of here, now!

868
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,585
Go, hurry!

869
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:20,429
Move slowly and quietly. The sharks know we’re here now.

870
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:32,908
Magnificent. Just like you and me... sister.

871
00:54:33,976 --> 00:54:35,177
No...

872
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:37,446
don’t group me in with your kind, Selah.

873
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:39,148
From the moment I was born,

874
00:54:39,215 --> 00:54:41,784
it was made very clear to me that I’m not one of you.

875
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:50,860
Where is Akula?

876
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:54,063
Akula?

877
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,131
Akula!

878
00:54:56,766 --> 00:55:00,035
They abandoned me, and you did nothing.

879
00:55:00,102 --> 00:55:01,871
I spared your life!

880
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:05,408
They wanted to kill you, but I wouldn’t let them.

881
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:07,843
I knew the human would take you in.

882
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,312
Weak, predictable humans.

883
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:12,047
My human has shown me more kindness

884
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:15,050
from the very beginning than any hybrid ever has.

885
00:55:15,117 --> 00:55:16,619
Think, Akula.

886
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:18,721
You are the link between human and shark.

887
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:21,056
I knew it then and I know it now.

888
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:23,092
We need you.

889
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:26,595
That changes nothing.

890
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:28,531
I know all about your plans.

891
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:32,868
We are returning home. To where we belong.

892
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,004
Not if you’re going to kill off humanity.

893
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,906
I won’t let you.

894
00:55:37,973 --> 00:55:40,409
You can watch from here or you...

895
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:42,845
we could finally go home.

896
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:54,089
[speaking Russian]

897
00:55:59,395 --> 00:56:01,530
Don’t scare me like that again!

898
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:03,032
Where have you been?

899
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:05,701
I heard something.

900
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:07,069
Could we steal one of the sharks’ rovers

901
00:56:07,136 --> 00:56:07,903
outside the building?

902
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,039
Yes, we have to get out of here.

903
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,740
Perfect. Henri?

904
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:13,008
All good, Commander.

905
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:20,783
We don’t have time for this.

906
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:25,354
Michael!

907
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:26,889
It’s either us or them.

908
00:56:30,459 --> 00:56:32,127
Get out! Get out!

909
00:56:39,335 --> 00:56:41,003
Commander...

910
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,605
Commander Tress, can you hear me?

911
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:44,173
It’s no use, Tom.

912
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,976
We need to keep working until someone gets back.

913
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,678
I hate feeling so helpless.

914
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:52,448
Me too, but we have our plants,

915
00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:55,851
Liam’s experiments, and our back-up oxygen reserves.

916
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:58,554
We could survive for months if we need to.

917
00:56:58,621 --> 00:57:03,225
Yeah, you’re right.

918
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:04,793
Well, let’s just...

919
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,161
-[clanging] -Oh!

920
00:57:06,228 --> 00:57:07,162
What was that?

921
00:57:10,332 --> 00:57:12,301
-The habitation chamber, hurry! -Go, go, go.

922
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,113
Those look like shark teeth.

923
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,948
Sharks on the moon... that’s what that was, yeah?

924
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,683
Whatever it is, we cannot let it destroy

925
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,786
the life support systems, we’ll never make it back if they do.

926
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,926
-Ah! -Josie!

927
00:57:46,602 --> 00:57:49,405
Which way to the rovers?

928
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:52,007
Those were children... babies.

929
00:57:52,074 --> 00:57:54,476
I did what I had to to survive.

930
00:57:54,543 --> 00:57:55,878
I saved our asses.

931
00:57:55,945 --> 00:57:57,746
And it’s not like I killed all of them,

932
00:57:57,813 --> 00:57:58,981
just a drop in the bucket.

933
00:57:59,048 --> 00:58:02,384
Enough! We have to move.

934
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:04,253
They’ll be on us any second.

935
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:09,892
We have to stick together or die alone, got it?

936
00:58:11,694 --> 00:58:14,096
Akula, lead the way.

937
00:58:26,342 --> 00:58:27,643
Get in.

938
00:58:40,923 --> 00:58:42,391
We gotta lose him.

939
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,792
Hold on!

940
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,569
Uh, he’s still there.

941
00:58:53,636 --> 00:58:55,571
Take him out.

942
00:58:55,638 --> 00:58:56,939
My pleasure.

943
00:59:02,811 --> 00:59:05,047
Nice shot.

944
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:08,050
It will be back... that wasn’t a kill shot.

945
00:59:08,117 --> 00:59:10,486
But you bought us precious time.

946
00:59:10,552 --> 00:59:13,389
All we need, just keep moving.

947
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:15,524
That’s an infrared communication device,

948
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:16,659
same we’ve got in our suits.

949
00:59:16,725 --> 00:59:19,161
Ellie? Tom?

950
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:21,430
Josie? Owen? Can anybody hear me?

951
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:24,867
This is Commander Nicole Tress.

952
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:26,235
If anyone can hear me,

953
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:27,803
we got aggressive company coming in hot.

954
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,438
Do what you can to arm the ship.

955
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:30,773
You must keep it safe.

956
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,676
I repeat, protect the ship at all costs.

957
00:59:33,742 --> 00:59:35,110
All right, everyone, keep an eye out...

958
00:59:35,177 --> 00:59:37,446
we don’t want any more surprises, got it?

959
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,458
Everyone inside, hurry.

960
00:59:54,763 --> 00:59:56,799
We’re too late.

961
00:59:56,865 --> 00:59:58,567
Come on, we gotta help them.

962
00:59:58,634 --> 00:59:59,702
How many were inside?

963
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:01,103
Four.

964
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:18,287
Where is everyone?

965
01:00:18,353 --> 01:00:20,923
No bodies and no blood.

966
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:22,391
We need to go room to room

967
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,861
and see if we can find any of your people.

968
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:29,264
Akula, stay by me.

969
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,448
What happened here?

970
01:00:46,515 --> 01:00:47,783
[gasping]

971
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,218
Oh! Nicole!

972
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:51,920
-You’re back! -Josie! Tom!

973
01:00:51,987 --> 01:00:52,955
Where’s everyone else?

974
01:00:53,021 --> 01:00:54,623
They’re not with you?

975
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,060
They went looking for you hours ago, and we’ve had no word.

976
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:01,864
Liam as well.

977
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,703
We think there’s some sharks still out there,

978
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,338
just not sure where.

979
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:10,539
They are sharks, right?

980
01:01:10,606 --> 01:01:13,008
Yes, and that’s why we need to make sure

981
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:14,710
we have everything armed against them.

982
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:15,878
Hold on, wait...

983
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:16,879
who are they?

984
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:18,947
What are you wearing,

985
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:20,516
And why doesn’t she have oxygen?

986
01:01:23,152 --> 01:01:24,386
We’ll explain everything later.

987
01:01:24,453 --> 01:01:26,021
That’s Sergei, that’s Akula,

988
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:27,456
and the only thing you need to know right now

989
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:29,758
is we need to get back to Earth now,

990
01:01:29,825 --> 01:01:31,293
with these two as part of the crew.

991
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,562
Good, I plotted us a course home,

992
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:36,064
but we only have four hours and 15 minute window.

993
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,066
If we repair breaches in the hull,

994
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:41,236
we can use some of our spare oxygen tanks as...

995
01:01:41,303 --> 01:01:43,806
well, as the algae-based biofuel I’ve been working on

996
01:01:43,872 --> 01:01:45,607
to jump-start the ship.

997
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:48,977
Great, the sooner we get off this rock, the better.

998
01:01:49,044 --> 01:01:50,979
Henri, do you think you can help Tom?

999
01:01:52,214 --> 01:01:54,650
Oh, my God, Henri, what happened?

1000
01:01:54,716 --> 01:01:56,585
That’s how they were able to find the ship.

1001
01:01:56,652 --> 01:01:58,687
They tortured me.

1002
01:01:58,754 --> 01:02:00,489
What? You did what?

1003
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:01,657
Stop!

1004
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,392
Josie, you tell Sergei what else you need.

1005
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,594
Akula, you come with us to the command module

1006
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:07,896
to help Tom and Henri.

1007
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:09,464
First, we need to repair the entrance.

1008
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:13,335
And I will not let Akula to be out of my sight again.

1009
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:15,537
If Nicole needs my help to get off the moon,

1010
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:17,306
then you need to let me come with her.

1011
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,442
[clanging]

1012
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:27,149
They’re back!

1013
01:02:31,987 --> 01:02:33,689
How many are there?

1014
01:02:33,755 --> 01:02:36,258
Ten, 20... a lot.

1015
01:02:36,325 --> 01:02:37,726
There are too many of them.

1016
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:39,628
And this... just a stupid baby.

1017
01:02:39,695 --> 01:02:43,932
There is no way we can kill them fast enough with our harpoons.

1018
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:45,267
We need a new plan.

1019
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:52,174
I’ve got this.

1020
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:54,109
-Henri, no! -That’s too dangerous!

1021
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,911
You have plenty of capable people here

1022
01:02:55,978 --> 01:02:57,145
that can repair the ship.

1023
01:02:57,212 --> 01:02:59,014
Josie and Tom figured out a way home,

1024
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,550
Akula and Sergei have been stuck here for 40 years,

1025
01:03:01,617 --> 01:03:03,819
and all I did was give up the location.

1026
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:05,020
Now I’m gonna fix it.

1027
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:06,555
What is he doing?

1028
01:03:06,622 --> 01:03:09,625
Saving your asses... and no one’s gonna stop me.

1029
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:11,526
-My mind’s already made up. -Wait...

1030
01:03:11,593 --> 01:03:13,428
I’m the commander, I should be doing this

1031
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:16,565
That’s exactly what you need to do, Commander... command.

1032
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:18,166
No, let him go.

1033
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:20,202
He’s the reason why we’re in this mess.

1034
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,406
You can barely stand on one foot.

1035
01:03:24,473 --> 01:03:26,875
The sharks were gonna find us no matter what.

1036
01:03:26,942 --> 01:03:28,610
No, they’re right.

1037
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:31,146
I’ll draw them away from the ship

1038
01:03:31,213 --> 01:03:33,148
and then I’ll take care of them.

1039
01:03:33,215 --> 01:03:35,050
Hopefully, I’ll be able to give them the slip,

1040
01:03:35,117 --> 01:03:37,452
and then together, we can get home.

1041
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,829
If we return, I will make sure you receive

1042
01:03:47,896 --> 01:03:50,399
the highest possible commendations.

1043
01:03:50,465 --> 01:03:52,601
When we get home, Commander.

1044
01:04:12,187 --> 01:04:14,456
All right, everyone, take cover.

1045
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:39,147
Ah!

1046
01:04:48,857 --> 01:04:51,193
Die, you son of a bitch!

1047
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:05,207
All clear.

1048
01:05:05,273 --> 01:05:06,742
Henri’s sacrifice won’t be forgotten.

1049
01:05:09,144 --> 01:05:10,412
All right, team, we have work to do.

1050
01:05:10,479 --> 01:05:11,580
Tom?

1051
01:05:13,415 --> 01:05:15,150
Yeah.

1052
01:05:15,217 --> 01:05:17,486
Seal off this section, plot us a course home.

1053
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,723
I’ll take care of the breach.

1054
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,724
Akula.

1055
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,162
Roger that, Commander.

1056
01:05:27,229 --> 01:05:28,530
Follow me.

1057
01:05:45,247 --> 01:05:47,115
Adjusting for our new weight,

1058
01:05:47,182 --> 01:05:50,786
using the moon’s gravitational pull to our advantage,

1059
01:05:50,852 --> 01:05:52,320
I think we can pull this off.

1060
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:57,759
Our flight path is clear, but...

1061
01:05:57,826 --> 01:05:59,194
But what?

1062
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:01,096
We have less time than I thought.

1063
01:06:01,163 --> 01:06:03,031
How much time we talking?

1064
01:06:03,098 --> 01:06:04,533
Twenty-four minutes and 37 seconds.

1065
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,001
You said we had four hours!

1066
01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:08,637
I forgot to adjust the amount of force required

1067
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,372
to get us to the speed to successfully

1068
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:11,807
fling us to the near side.

1069
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:13,675
Our initial launch didn’t account for us

1070
01:06:13,742 --> 01:06:15,710
being on the far side.

1071
01:06:21,383 --> 01:06:23,652
I just fixed the hull breach.

1072
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,855
Let’s everyone be ready so we can hit that window.

1073
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,391
Let’s move.

1074
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:30,792
More sharks will be showing up any second.

1075
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:36,131
Oh, no.

1076
01:06:36,198 --> 01:06:39,067
What? What is it?

1077
01:06:39,134 --> 01:06:40,469
They’re here.

1078
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:50,145
They’re loading up the eggs!

1079
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,182
They’re boarding the ship.

1080
01:06:58,086 --> 01:06:59,621
Who is that?

1081
01:07:03,024 --> 01:07:06,161
That’s Tzarina Selah. She’s their leader.

1082
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:12,601
[Selah] Search the ship! Kill all who remain.

1083
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,202
We still need to seal the interior hull

1084
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:15,537
before we can take off.

1085
01:07:15,604 --> 01:07:16,972
You’re not wearing protective suits.

1086
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:19,808
They can detect your electromagnetic signature.

1087
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:23,445
Stay near electronics... they’ll go after you first.

1088
01:07:23,512 --> 01:07:25,580
I need to download the flight plan onto my drive.

1089
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:27,516
We can’t let them have it.

1090
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:29,551
We have to hold on to that.

1091
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:30,952
[banging]

1092
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:33,655
We can’t risk it, we need everyone alive.

1093
01:07:33,722 --> 01:07:36,591
Find a place to hide, and attack only when necessary.

1094
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:44,366
Everyone hide, now!

1095
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:59,274
Ah!

1096
01:09:03,378 --> 01:09:05,714
Come on, come on...

1097
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,415
Got it!

1098
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:11,720
Oh, shit.

1099
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,894
Tom...

1100
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,766
Ah!

1101
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,835
You’re a freak of nature, you know that?

1102
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,942
Do your worst.

1103
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,015
Stop!

1104
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:45,520
We surrender.

1105
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:23,558
Akula, sister.

1106
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:25,894
You should have taken me up on my offer.

1107
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,264
After all, none of this could have happened without your help.

1108
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:30,799
What offer? What help?

1109
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:32,767
How do you think we learned how to fly a ship?

1110
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,402
When you were out hunting us,

1111
01:10:34,469 --> 01:10:37,105
we sent some hybrids to break into your ship

1112
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:38,640
and learn everything they could.

1113
01:10:38,707 --> 01:10:40,342
I didn’t know, Papa.

1114
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,444
I had no idea.

1115
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,112
Don’t be modest.

1116
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:47,048
Now you have a chance to live among your real family

1117
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:51,152
and be a leader of our people on Earth.

1118
01:10:51,219 --> 01:10:52,487
Is it true?

1119
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:55,023
She offered it, yes,

1120
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,493
but I never considered it, not for a moment.

1121
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,730
Sharks are not my family.

1122
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:04,332
They left me for dead.

1123
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:05,934
You are my family.

1124
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,537
Exactly why we abandoned you near his ship to begin with.

1125
01:11:09,604 --> 01:11:13,708
Our plan was executed perfectly. All thanks to you.

1126
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:16,111
I swear, I didn’t know, Papa.

1127
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:17,112
You believe me, right?

1128
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:20,115
I trust you.

1129
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:23,051
She’s my daughter.

1130
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,454
I trust her with my life.

1131
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:33,094
Selah, it’s not too late.

1132
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:39,200
You could continue your good work here.

1133
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:42,170
We can go back to Earth and return with supplies.

1134
01:11:42,237 --> 01:11:45,573
You could grow and thrive.

1135
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,942
Just let us go.

1136
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,845
Humans made you...

1137
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:52,447
we can help you.

1138
01:11:52,514 --> 01:11:54,716
I’d rather take Earth for my own.

1139
01:11:54,783 --> 01:11:57,552
We’re leaving... now.

1140
01:12:18,006 --> 01:12:20,508
We need to get off this ship.

1141
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,879
Guards don’t speak English.

1142
01:12:26,181 --> 01:12:27,882
I don’t think we can trust her anymore.

1143
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:29,684
What more does she have to do?

1144
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,020
She’s saved your ass more times today than I can count.

1145
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,956
She’s proven herself to be worth not only our trust,

1146
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:36,024
but our respect.

1147
01:12:38,293 --> 01:12:39,260
I believe you.

1148
01:12:39,327 --> 01:12:40,295
Thank you.

1149
01:12:40,361 --> 01:12:41,496
I believe you, too.

1150
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:52,073
I suppose if you’re in here with us, you’re one of us.

1151
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,042
So, we’re good?

1152
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:55,243
Sure.

1153
01:12:56,945 --> 01:12:59,981
Okay, maybe there’s a way out of here.

1154
01:13:00,048 --> 01:13:02,183
If we can get out, maybe there’s something on your ship.

1155
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,818
No, there’s...

1156
01:13:08,056 --> 01:13:09,891
Oh, my God, they’re gonna torture us.

1157
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,826
Not without a fight, they aren’t.

1158
01:13:19,234 --> 01:13:20,835
Gotcha.

1159
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:23,371
[All] Henri!

1160
01:13:23,438 --> 01:13:26,274
Henri!

1161
01:13:28,309 --> 01:13:29,844
Ah!

1162
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:41,322
Tom’s USB.

1163
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:52,233
The flight plans!

1164
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,601
If we can get this back to your ship, Sergei,

1165
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:55,203
we can use this to get back

1166
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,971
and warn Earth that the sharks aren’t to be trusted.

1167
01:13:57,038 --> 01:13:59,140
We could fight!

1168
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,681
There!

1169
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:11,319
Depressurizing.

1170
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:18,593
They’ll be here any second, hurry!

1171
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,495
It looks to be about 50 feet down.

1172
01:14:20,562 --> 01:14:21,963
It’s only gonna get further,

1173
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:24,299
and gravity’s gonna slow you down, now, go!

1174
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:26,601
One at a time to be safe.

1175
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:32,774
Come on, hurry!

1176
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,243
I’ll go first, so I can catch you when you land.

1177
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,611
I’m not a kid anymore.

1178
01:14:36,678 --> 01:14:39,280
I will not let you to be hurt.

1179
01:14:39,347 --> 01:14:40,782
Wait for my command!

1180
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:52,727
Akula, jump!

1181
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:55,897
Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

1182
01:14:55,964 --> 01:14:59,867
Warning, hatch breach in Module Four.

1183
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:02,704
-You next. -No, you!

1184
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,872
Stop!

1185
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:07,208
-Change of plans. -Ah!

1186
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,415
[grunts]

1187
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:15,416
Where is Akula?

1188
01:15:15,483 --> 01:15:16,451
Are you all right, boss?

1189
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:18,286
Yeah, I’m fine.

1190
01:15:18,353 --> 01:15:20,555
[speaking Russian]

1191
01:15:20,622 --> 01:15:22,624
I wish I could take credit.

1192
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,827
Scar...

1193
01:15:25,893 --> 01:15:28,863
But it was a human that killed your precious bodyguard.

1194
01:15:37,839 --> 01:15:38,906
It’s Akula...

1195
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:40,942
and something else.

1196
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,013
Akula.

1197
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,516
Is that the tzarina?

1198
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:50,118
It was.

1199
01:15:50,184 --> 01:15:52,453
Pretty sure she got some brain damage, or worse.

1200
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,921
Guys...

1201
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:03,097
My ship is not far away... run!

1202
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,208
Over here!

1203
01:16:14,275 --> 01:16:15,643
I’ve set up a perimeter of booby traps

1204
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:17,145
that will help slow them down.

1205
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,596
There is a way we can destroy the rest of the sharks,

1206
01:16:35,663 --> 01:16:37,465
and maybe, if we are lucky,

1207
01:16:37,532 --> 01:16:39,734
we can destroy their ship before it gets too far.

1208
01:16:39,801 --> 01:16:41,002
Out with it!

1209
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:42,470
What? What is it?

1210
01:16:42,537 --> 01:16:45,339
The nitrogen-enriched soil I use to grow crops

1211
01:16:45,406 --> 01:16:47,675
can be used to make an explosion.

1212
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:51,245
I can’t believe that I didn’t think of this sooner.

1213
01:16:52,747 --> 01:16:55,917
There is no bomb that you can make that will reach the sharks.

1214
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:57,585
Yes, but I can make the ones

1215
01:16:57,652 --> 01:17:01,422
that would aggravate the magma under the moon’s surface.

1216
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:04,092
I can fly my rocket straight into the center.

1217
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:06,961
It’s the only way.

1218
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:10,431
But you’ll die!

1219
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,304
Anything will be wiped out on the surface within 50 miles.

1220
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:17,705
Including us.

1221
01:17:17,772 --> 01:17:20,808
The geo-thermal disturbance will create tidal waves of lava

1222
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:24,212
that will spread easily over 50 miles.

1223
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:30,218
Looks like they’re flanking us, we have to move... run.

1224
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:51,773
That’s not going to hold long.

1225
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:53,107
She doesn’t have much,

1226
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:58,546
but controls still working, engine runs.

1227
01:17:58,613 --> 01:18:01,382
And we just have enough fuel for one shot.

1228
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:06,187
I can do it all by myself, but I need you buy me some time.

1229
01:18:06,254 --> 01:18:09,056
There has to be a better way.

1230
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:10,658
We don’t have time.

1231
01:18:10,725 --> 01:18:12,293
They’re already here.

1232
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,928
Sergei, no!

1233
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:16,130
I’ll stay with you, I’ll...

1234
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:19,500
Akula, my sweet daughter,

1235
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:21,235
my dearest daughter,

1236
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:23,938
I’m finally ready to do something by myself.

1237
01:18:24,005 --> 01:18:27,341
I need you to go with Nicole and Michael,

1238
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:32,713
and keep the hybrids off my back so we can destroy them.

1239
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,983
You are the best fighter I know.

1240
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,852
You can do it.

1241
01:18:37,919 --> 01:18:40,054
Spasiba, Papa.

1242

[speaks Russian]

1243
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:53,067
Keep it with you.

1244
01:18:53,134 --> 01:18:55,670
I’ve always saved it for the long time,

1245
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:57,271
while we land in the sea.

1246
01:18:57,338 --> 01:18:58,306
Keep it on you.

1247
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,408
When you land, it will do the job.

1248
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:03,444
Trust me... it will do the job.

1249
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:10,518
Now, go.

1250
01:19:10,585 --> 01:19:13,421
Please keep them off my back so we can break theirs.

1251
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,123
Go!

1252
01:19:23,664 --> 01:19:24,699
You ready?

1253
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:27,501
Ready?

Who could be?

1255
01:19:30,104 --> 01:19:31,472
Well, too bad.

01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:43,618

01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:22,970
What on Earth?

1270
01:23:23,037 --> 01:23:25,005
Exactly!

1271
01:23:25,072 --> 01:23:28,742
Earth!

1272
01:23:28,809 --> 01:23:30,010
We’re here!

1273
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:32,746
I can’t believe we’re here!

1274
01:23:32,813 --> 01:23:36,884
Papa was right... we’re home, thanks to Papa.

1275
01:23:36,951 --> 01:23:39,753
We’ll make sure his sacrifice is not forgotten.

1276
01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:44,325
Papa described Earth to me, and he was right.

1277
01:23:44,391 --> 01:23:48,129
He said it would eclipse all of my wildest imagination.

1278
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,264
Oh, it’s beautiful, Papa!

1279
01:23:50,331 --> 01:23:52,500
It really is.

1280
01:23:52,566 --> 01:23:55,236
I’m never gonna take it for granted again.

1281
01:23:56,871 --> 01:24:00,040
We need to figure out how to get back.

1282
01:24:00,107 --> 01:24:04,979
Maybe wait till dark, plot a detailed course with the stars.

1283
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:07,214
Oh, it hurts...

1284
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:08,582
oh, it really, really hurts, ugh!

1285
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:10,451
Akula! Where does it hurt?

1286
01:24:10,518 --> 01:24:12,186
It’s coming in waves!

1287
01:24:12,253 --> 01:24:15,389
All right, just breathe, deep breaths.

1288
01:24:15,456 --> 01:24:17,424
[heavy breathing]

1289
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:22,897
Akula, did you maybe have any sort of...

1290
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:25,633
relationship with any of the shark hybrids?

1291
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:27,835
What? No!

1292
01:24:27,902 --> 01:24:29,370
Ah!

1293
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:33,774
Akula, I think you’re pregnant.

1294
01:24:33,841 --> 01:24:34,975
What?

1295
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:36,310
How is it possible?

1296
01:24:36,377 --> 01:24:38,646
Automatic parthenogenesis?

1297
01:24:38,712 --> 01:24:41,348
Sergei mentioned it happening to the other sharks.

1298
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:47,521
Akula, push!

1299
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:52,426
[screams]

1300
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:05,573
It’s... it’s adorable!

1301
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:08,776
Oh, great... now we have another mouth to feed.

1302
01:25:10,144 --> 01:25:11,312
Ah!

1303
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:13,614
Son of a bitch, these teeth are sharp!

1304
01:25:13,681 --> 01:25:16,984
Nicole, I’ve got to take care of my babies!

1305
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:19,420
Akula!

1306
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:26,627
Akula! Akula!

1307
01:25:30,864 --> 01:25:32,566
We’re so fu--
