Oh yeah, nice.

Today was such

We're so blessed with
our beautiful family.

Oh, which reminds me, I
have something for you.

00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,926
Something corny.

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,231
No, it's a, it's a bunch of our
family photos, my favorites.

27
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,100
I mean, I've made you a
playlist a thousand times.

28
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,201
I just thought I'd do
something different for you.

29
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:23,602
This is so sweet, I love it.

00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:24,536
Aw, you wanna look at it?

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,604
- Yes.

Ooh, ooh.

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,764
Maybe not my best look.

55
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:52,732
Aw.

56
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,233
Look, you're always traveling.

57
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,467
I just wanted you to know

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,236
that we're always
with you, alright?

59
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,204
I love it.

60
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:58,971
Good, I'm glad.

61
00:02:59,005 --> 00:02:59,772
Thank you.

62
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,572
You're welcome.

63
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,406
Oh my gosh.

64
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,241
Look at this.

65
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,709
This is amazing!

66
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:04,509

Mm, it does.

73
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,363
Are you doing
this salad tomorrow?

74
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:26,666
Nope, it's already done.

75
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,100
Oh, wow.

76
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,302
You do know what
time it is, don't you?

77
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,502
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

78
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,369
It's time for
the dance! [laughs]

79
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,005
You are so silly.

80
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,806
Stop that.

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,308
[Daniel laughing]

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,508
Just because you're some
big time music executive,

83
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,509
doesn't mean you
can make me dance.

84
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,011
Oh, but I can.

85
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,313
Oh. [laughs]

86
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,479
I love you Abby Thompson.

93
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:51,356
You're welcome,
you're welcome.

94
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,524
Alright.

95
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:53,693
- That looks so good.
- That looks great.

96
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,027
Who wants to say grace?

97
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,029
You know, I'd like
to say it tonight.

98
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,731
Alright.

99
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,334
Dear heavenly Father,

100
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,568
we thank you for the
blessings bestowed upon us,

101
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:06,404
for the food before us,

102
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,908
for the roof above us,

103
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,710
for our family together,

104
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:13,411
and for all the love
we share between us.

105
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,379
Amen.

106
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,348
[Jay] Amen.

107
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,448
That was beautiful, Mom.

108
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,382
Thank you.

109
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:18,383
It was a beautiful day.

110
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,652
[Jay] You're beautiful.

111
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,419
Uh, thank you, Jay.

112
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:25,024
Is there something
you want, Jay?

113
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,491
No, I mean it.

114
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:28,027
I do not want anything.

115
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,996
Mm hmm.
[Daniel laughing]

116
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:33,833
Well, unless I
can get something.

117
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,534
We already have
everything we need.

118
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,237
Oh, which reminds me.

119
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,537
[Abby] Mm hmm?

120
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,073
Time you leaving for
your trip tomorrow?

121
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:42,642
[Abby] Oh, that's right,
I still have to pack.

122
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,277
I'm gonna get on the road
at eight tomorrow morning.

123
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,512
Mm, yikes, you're gonna
hit a lot of city traffic.

124
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:48,814
[Abby] I know.

125
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:50,149
[Lindsey] How long are
you gonna be gone this time?

126
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:51,150
Ah, should just be overnight.

127
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:53,019
One meeting, a
couple of signatures,

128
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,287
and then I'll be headed home.

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,289
Good, I want you to
be here for the dance.

130
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:58,724
Oh, I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

131
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,928
[Jay] I would, unless I
could be the photographer?

132
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,195
Jay, when you
get to high school,

133
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,897
you can be on the
school paper like me,

134
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,265
and you can be the photographer.

135
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:07,366
[Jay] Great.

136
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,301
- [Daniel laughing]
- There you go.

137
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,368
[Daniel] That's it.

138
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,970
Eat up, guys.

139
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:11,904
This looks great.

140
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,372
[Daniel] Mm, glad you like it.

141
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:15,540
[Jay] Mm, oh, the
macaroni's good.

142
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,776
- It's very good.
- Good, it is.

[Officer] Are you
Daniel Thompson?

147
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,383
[Daniel] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

148
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:25,617
What do you need?

149
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,054
[Officer] Sir, there's
been an accident.

150
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:28,854
Okay.

151
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,089
Your wife.

152
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,390
Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, Abby?

153
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,925
Mom?

154
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,260
Wait, wait, yeah, is
she alright, where is she?

155
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,328
I'm sorry, sir.

156
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,063
She was in an accident,

157
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,664
and she was killed on impact.

158
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:42,635
What?

159
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:45,871
[Jay] You're lying!

160
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:46,672
No!

161
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:49,574
[Officer] Sir, I'm sorry.

162
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:50,776
[Daniel] No.

163
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,312
We found all her
belongings in the car.

164
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:58,351
We're gonna need you to
come down and identify her.

165
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,320
Abby, no, no.
[Lindsey sobbing]

[Lindsey sniffling]

167
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:06,058
I need you to come down,

168
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,361
and call me on your way,

169
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,796
and I'll meet you there, okay?

170
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,697
Okay.

171
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:12,832
[Officer] Here's my card.

172
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,470
Alright.

173
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,871
I'm sorry again.

00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,358
Jay, are you okay?

178
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,359
No.

179
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,363
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

180
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,432
You gotta just take
it one day at a time.

[somber music]

182
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,634
Where's my mom?

183
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,370
She was so good.

184
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:52,204
She loved us.

185
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,474
I don't know, Josh.

186
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,743
I don't think there's a God.

187
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:59,145
Why would he do this?

188
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,714
I don't think God did this.

189
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:04,150
Okay, this was a
drunk driver, Josh.

190
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:05,718
An accident.

191
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,520
But she didn't have to die.

192
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,623
Do you think there's a God?

193
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:18,497
I don't know what
to think right now.

194
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,564
I just miss Mom.

195
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:20,565
[air whooshing]

196
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:21,901
Beautiful.

197
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,302
You think so?

198
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,437
My baby girl's all grown up!

199
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,338
[air whooshing]

200
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,473
I just miss Mom.

201
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,442
[sniffles] I do too.

202
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:30,843
I know, I know.

203
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:36,415
Daniel, I'm so sorry
about what happened.

204
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,716
She was a beautiful person.

205
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,851
We all loved her.

206
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,519
Thank you.

207
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:41,586
I'm so sorry.

208
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,556
Oh, thank you so
much for coming.

209
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,324
Brandon, please say
hi to the family.

210
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:46,292
Thank you.

211
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,893
The church is there for you,

212
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:51,130
your family is there for
you, I'm there for you.

213
00:07:51,163 --> 00:07:52,364
I know.

214
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:53,566
[Jack] Did you know I
brought your kids back

215
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,366
from the church?

216
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,167
Thanks.

217
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,570
Nice to see you, Jack.

218
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,504
Jack?

219
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,274
Hey, hey, Pop?

220
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:05,444
Oh, pastor, it was
a beautiful service.

221
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,412
Well, thank you.

222
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,780
I'm glad you liked it, Jack.

223
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:10,449
You guys wanna go with
me and greet the guests?

224
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:11,250
I do.

225
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,785
We can't, Jay.

226
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:13,886
Sorry, Grandpa,

227
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,154
our dad needs us.

228
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:16,555
Okay, but if you
wanna get away,

229
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,190
I have a getaway car outside.

230
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:20,526
If you kids feel you wanna
get away, let me know, okay?

231
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,161
I'm sure they'll take
you up on the offer.

232
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:23,562
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Pop.

233
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,533
How are you two doing?

234
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,669
- [somber music]
- We're not good.

235
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:34,573
Lindsey, do you
know Pastor John?

236
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:38,110
He runs the youth
group at the church.

237
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,612
Yeah, I've met him.

238
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:44,750
Pastor John runs a grief
support group as well.

239
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:50,556
Lindsey, please, we
would like you to join

240
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,692
our grief support group
when you're ready.

241
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,230
Jay, you can come too.

242
00:08:58,264 --> 00:08:59,365
Thanks, pastor.

243
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,034
I'm not ready yet.

244
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,303
I know, I know.

245
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,674
When you are, we're
there for you.

246
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,483
Thanks, pastor, really.

247
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,753
And the church is
there for you too,

248
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,955
and we'll always
be there for you.

249
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,156
[Daniel] You've been
a lifelong friend.

250
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,691
We appreciate it, alright?

251
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:26,892
Thank you, thank you.

252
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:27,693
Alright.

253
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:28,662
God bless.

254
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,995
God bless you.

255
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:34,800
Hey, how're you doing?

256
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,674
- [melancholic music]
- [sighs] Oh, God.

257
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,375
[drawers banging]

258
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,711
Oh, God, I'm gonna be late!

259
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,281
Where is it?

260
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,717
I thought it was...

261
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,553
[Lindsey yelling]

262
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,258
Mom, I can't do
this without you.

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,229
God, why would you
take her away from me?

264
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:04,530
Why?

265
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,531
[Daniel] Hey?

266
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,666
[door knocking]

267
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,634
Is everything alright?

268
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,568
No, nothing is alright!

269
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,203
Why can't you understand that?

270
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:13,872
I think I might be able to.

271
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,075
No, you can't, because I'm 16.

272
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,644
I should still have my Mom!

273
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,044
Hey, hey!

274
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,879
Have you forgotten that
your mother was my wife?

275
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,716
I lost her too!

276
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,116
I lost her!

277
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:24,917
I'm sorry.

278
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,318
[Daniel] Oh God.

279
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,886
- I'm sorry, Dad, I didn't...
- No, no, no, no.

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,421
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

281
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,857
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

282
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,158
I'm sorry.

283
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,793
Look, we're all going
through this, alright?

284
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:36,595
We all lost her.

285
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,032
Lindsey, look, do you
remember that group

286
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,033
the pastor was talking about?

287
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,234
No, please,

288
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,202
- that's not gonna help.
- No, no, no.

289
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:43,969
No, it's not gonna help.

290
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:44,937
It won't bring Mom back.

291
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,206
No, but it can't hurt either.

292
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:49,775
Look, no, listen,

293
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,077
your heart is so pained,

294
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,279
your mother would never
want you to feel this way.

295
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,681
Please, just go for me.

296
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:56,716
Just go, please,
just once, just once.

297
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,751
- Please, okay?
- Fine.

298
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,754
But I wanna do this on my own.

299
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:04,556
Okay.

300
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,762
Let me drive, okay?

301
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:11,964
- Okay.
- Come on.

302
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,605
[Lindsey sniffles]

303
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:23,509
[elevator rumbling]

304
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,615
[John] How's your
week been, Ava?

305
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:30,416
[Ava] Good.

306
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:31,685
[John] That's good.

307
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,152
We're glad to see
you back again.

308
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:34,486
Yeah, it's been a, it's
been a wonderful week.

309
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,221
We had a lot going
on with the church.

310
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:37,956
And, yeah, so we're very excited

311
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,760
to have those special activity
things lined up as well,

312
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:42,696
so it's always fun with them.

313
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:43,829
Ricky, how've you
been this week?

314
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,431
For those of you
just joining us,

315
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:47,032
I'd like to tell you a
bit about what we do here

316
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,668
in the group.

317
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:52,739
Our grief support group is a
place of healing and of hope.

318
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,741
We like to remember our
loved ones out loud.

319
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,843
We share stories, we share
memories good and bad,

320
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:59,912
but more importantly,
we support each other

321
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,781
through the sadness of loss,

322
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:04,283
and we move into the
comfort of knowing

323
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:08,220
that they remain in our hearts
and our memories forever.

324
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:10,956
Now, I'd like to
have our new members

325
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,124
go ahead and
introduce themselves,

326
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:13,793
then we'll share some stories.

327
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,396
Would you like to go first?

328
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:21,200
Hi, I'm Lindsey.

329
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,535
I lost my mom a few months ago.

330
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:26,405
Hi, Lindsey.

331
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:27,774
We're happy to meet you.

332
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,174
Thank you for being here.

333
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,576
And how about you?

334
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,748
Hi, I'm, I'm Andrew.

335
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:37,449
I lost my brother in a car
accident about a year ago,

336
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:40,586
and things haven't
really gotten better,

337
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,055
so my mom recommended I
come to a support group.

338
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,725
Well, thank you, Andrew.

339
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,694
At the very least, we hope you
can find some comfort here,

340
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,261
and know you're not alone.

341
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:50,864
Thank you.

342
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,767
So, would anyone like to
begin by sharing a story?

343
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,235
I'd like to share
my story, John.

344
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:57,569
[John] Oh, Ava, please.

345
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:03,108
My husband and I were trying
to have a baby for so long.

346
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:06,880
We thought after IVF and
for trying for so long

347
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,380
that it would never happen,

348
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:11,885
but we were happy because
we knew that we had options.

349
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,626
One night we went to a restaurant
with my husband's boss.

350
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,128
It was this restaurant
on the top of a building,

351
00:13:23,162 --> 00:13:24,430
really high up.

352
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,899
Now, I don't do heights,
[gentle music]

353
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,635
so I got really sick.

354
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,036
It was so embarrassing.

355
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,776
The next night I was still sick.

356
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,813
I mean, every smell, just about
anything made me feel sick.

357
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,215
He knew I was pregnant,

358
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:46,552
but I was like, "No,
I mean, it can't be."

359
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,220
He went out, he
bought me a test,

360
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,589
and it turns out he was
right, I was pregnant.

361
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,927
We were so happy.

362
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,263
I mean, it was probably one
of the second best moments

363
00:13:58,297 --> 00:13:59,131
of our lives.

364
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,435
Our first was when
our baby boy was born.

365
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:06,004
It was pure joy.

366
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:08,942
Our family was complete.

367
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:17,149
A week later, he went
on a business trip,

368
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:20,552
and the plane crashed,

369
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:21,688
and he didn't make it.

370
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,326
But he got to meet Ryan Junior.

371
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,931
[John] Ava, thank you so
much for sharing that story.

372
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:32,799
You're welcome.

373
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,605
It's hard, but I realized
through the process of healing,

374
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:46,178
there are more good memories
than there could ever be bad.

375
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:54,353
I just wish that I could
hear him again, or see him.

376
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:58,457
Thank you.

377
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:05,364
Would any of our new members
like to share a story?

378
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,770
I'm not ready yet.

379
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:12,672
That's okay.

380
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:15,574
When you're ready,
we'll be here.

381
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,276
You know, remembering
our loved ones out loud

382
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:20,245
is greatly helpful.

383
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,313
[gentle music]

384
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:22,982
It keeps them in our hearts.

385
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,986
Andrew, would you like to share?

386
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,889
I guess, yeah, yeah.

387
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:30,723
Yeah, I'll go.

388
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:35,294
But it's kind of hard to
remember things right now.

389
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:42,534
No good memories, no bad
ones, just, it just all sucks.

390
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:48,473
You know, I was in that car
accident where my brother died.

391
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:51,711
Why not me?

392
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,846
What makes me so special?

393
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,681
He was my brother.

394
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:55,480
He was my twin.

395
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,683
He was a part of me.

396
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:02,021
We were supposed to
travel the world together,

397
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:03,455
and now it's just me,

398
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,926
and that ain't right.

399
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:12,031
Andrew, it's,
it's not just you.

400
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,499
You know, he's
still part of you,

401
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,401
and remembering him
is gonna help you.

402
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,039
Thank you for sharing.

403
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:22,574
[Lindsey] Pastor John?

404
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,276
[John] Yes, Lindsey.

405
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,713
Could I tell a little
about my mom, maybe?

406
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,113
Yes, I think we'd love that.

407
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,150
My last memory of her,

408
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,886
she was helping me
pick out my dress

409
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,487
for my first school dance.

410
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:41,094
My mom was so sweet,
always loving.

411
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,633
Her dream was to be there
for me at my wedding,

412
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,138
but now she won't be able to.

413
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm sorry, I can't
talk about this yet.

414
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:02,715
And that's okay.

415
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:04,349
Thank you so much for sharing.

416
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,119
You know, the healing
process takes time.

417
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,488
And Lindsey, when you're
ready, we'll be here to listen.

418
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,061
Well, I think that's a
good place to leave it.

419
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,830
We do have some flyers
over on the table there.

420
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:20,833
It has some fun activities
to help the healing process.

421
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,467
And before we go,

422
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,504
I'd like you do a
little bit of homework

423
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,172
for this, this next week.

424
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:30,242
Now, before you look at me
like that, it's nothing hard.

425
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,211
I'd like you to talk to a
relative or a mutual friend,

426
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:37,016
and have them share a
good memory with you.

427
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,950
I'd like you to write it down,

428
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,153
and if you feel comfortable,

429
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,988
share it when you
come back next week,

430
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:43,756
and we'll start on
our memory books.

431
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:47,026
Alright?

432
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,393
Thanks again for
coming everybody.

433
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:50,863
Remember, there are some
flyers over by the coffee,

434
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:52,131
that have some
recommended reading.

435
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:54,167
As always, if you need
to talk to me at all,

436
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:56,535
feel free to come find me.

437
00:17:57,837 --> 00:17:58,738
Have a wonderful week.

438
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:07,013
Chocolate chip was
Matthew's favorite cookie.

439
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:12,284
Hey, I'm sorry
about your brother.

440
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,186
Thanks.

441
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,189
Sorry about your mother too.

442
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,158
Guess we all gotta lose
someone at some point.

443
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:21,393
Yeah, but it
doesn't feel fair.

444
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:22,260
I know.

445
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,199
Were you close
to your brother?

446
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,601
Yeah, we were pretty
much like the same person.

447
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:33,706
We even had our own way
of talking to each other.

448
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,208
Yeah, I've heard that,

449
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,210
that twins can have their
own secret language.

450
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,978
That's actually really cool.

451
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,214
Yeah, yeah, guess so.

452
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,751
Well, I gotta go,
my dad's waiting.

453
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:47,053
But it was nice to meet you.
[hopeful music]

454
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:50,255
Hey, I hope you come back.

455
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:53,525
I think I will.

456
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,735
[Daniel] Ugh, it's
a hot day today, man.

457
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:04,203
Hey, you alright?

458
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,143
No, seriously, you okay?

459
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:15,148
I don't know.

460
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,549
What's wrong?

461
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:19,719
I don't know.

462
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:21,586
Alright, you
wanna talk about it?

463
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,189
Why?

464
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:24,257
It won't bring Mom back!

465
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:28,995
No, but it's nice
to remember her.

466
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,999
Lindsey says Mom is living
in heaven now with God.

467
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:34,867
I just wish I could
talk to her, Dad.

468
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:38,237
It would be so nice if
a text or phone call

469
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,405
could reach all the
way up to heaven.

470
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:41,274
I know.

471
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,442
Look, I knew someone that
wrote a message in a-

472
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,646
- I don't want that, I want Mom!

473
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,815
I want Mom too, okay?

474
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,683
I'm sorry things have changed.

475
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,220
Dad, I don't wanna hike today.

476
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,420
I just wanna go back home.

477
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,191
Right, you don't wanna hike?

478
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,424
You just wanna go home?

479
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:00,893
Yeah.

480
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,261
Watch a movie with me?

481
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:03,296
Sure.

482
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:05,765
It's hot anyway, right?

483
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:06,966
Come on, come on.

484
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:21,513
[rain pattering]
[gentle guitar music]

485
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:30,723
[Daniel sighs]

486
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:34,392
I'm having a real
hard time here, Abby.

487
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,068
The kids are so sad.

488
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,339
I'm just trying to
make them feel loved.

489
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:57,884
Just don't laugh at me if
I start to cry. [laughs]

490
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:00,686
You know, I remember
you saying once

491
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,189
that real men do cry.

492
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,727
Well, this man cries for you.

493
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:10,663
I love you, Abby.

494
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:15,268
[gentle guitar music]

495
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,116
Oh, man.
[hopeful music]

496
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:32,385
Those cookies smell great.

497
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,387
If it's cookies,
you know it's for me.

498
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,420
Every kid loves cookies.

499
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,489
Dad, it's for group.

500
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:38,357
[Daniel And Josh] Oh.

501
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:39,926
Can we just have one?

502
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,193
Just one?

503
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:43,863
Not unless you come
to group with me.

504
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:44,664
Good luck.

505
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,368
This is a real nice
thing you're doing here.

506
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:50,403
Thanks, Dad.

507
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:53,406
How about one for the old man?

508
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:56,441
Want an apple?

509
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,380
Sure.

510
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:05,418
[Daniel and Lindsey chuckling]

511
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,271
Andrew, this is my
little brother, Josh.

512
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,272
Josh, meet Andrew.

513
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:29,175
Hey, Josh.

514
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,243
So, you're the reason

515
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:34,413
my sister won't let me have
any cookies, aren't you?

516
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,414
Me?

517
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:38,417
Well, nice to meet
you too, Josh.

518
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:43,089
I'm gonna go sit down.

519
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:44,290
You can stop now.

520
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,825
I'm just messing
with you, little man.

521
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:47,259
Coming to a good spot.

522
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:48,593
Place helps me out a lot.

523
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,396
[Josh] Sure.

524
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,331
How's your week been?

525
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:53,232
I've had a good week.

526
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:54,000
Did you have a good week?

527
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,401
Yeah, it was.

528
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:57,103
My dad set up to scholarship
in my mom's name,

529
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:58,971
and we met a few
of the recipients.

530
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:00,373
Oh, that's cool.

531
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,074
Yeah, it really was.

532
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:07,446
Hey, you wanna go
get coffee sometime?

533
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,951
Maybe talk about your mother,
or my brother, or the weather?

534
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:13,252
Yeah, I'd like that.

535
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,287
Maybe you can meet my
best friend, Katie.

536
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:16,689
Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool.

537
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,025
Okay, let's go.

538
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:19,859
Yeah.

539
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:23,796
Alright, everyone.

540
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:24,764
Well, let's go ahead
and take our seats,

541
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:25,563
and we can begin.

542
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,469
It's always nice to see
new faces in the group.

543
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:31,637
And as a little reminder,

544
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,340
I like to say what it
is we do in this group.

545
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:38,277
Our grief support group is
a place of healing and hope.

546
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,478
[gentle music]

547
00:23:39,512 --> 00:23:42,481
We like to remember our
loved ones out loud.

548
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:46,152
We share stories, we share
memories, good and bad,

549
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,387
and more importantly, we
like to support each other,

550
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:51,057
as we move from the
sadness of loss,

551
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,525
to finding the comfort

552
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,027
of knowing that our loved
ones reside in our hearts

553
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:56,395
and our memories forever.

554
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,532
I'd like the new
faces in the group

555
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,866
to go ahead and
introduce themselves.

556
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,202
And we'll go ahead and
start sharing some stories.

557
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:08,240
My name's Josh and
my sister made me come.

558
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,242
Well, it's good
to see you, Josh.

559
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:11,410
Thank you for coming.

560
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:12,545
Thanks for bringing
him, Lindsey.

561
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,379
And?

562
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:17,016
Hi, my name is Carrie.

563
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:20,086
I lost my baby boy.

564
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:22,521
He had cancer.

565
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,257
Hi, Carrie.

566
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,492
I really hope both of you

567
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,227
can find some comfort
in being here with us.

568
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,763
Carrie, would you like
to share a little more

569
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:31,997
about your story?

570
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,532
No pressure.

571
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:35,901
No, I'm not ready.

572
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:39,738
It's, it's hard to
talk about still.

573
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:42,308
We're glad you're here.

574
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,577
If you need to talk,
I'm always here.

575
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:49,081
I lost my mom not too long ago,

576
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:50,683
and I know it's not the same,

577
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:53,586
but this group is
really helping me.

578
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,589
Thank you, Lindsey.

579
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,224
Whatever we can do to help,

580
00:24:58,257 --> 00:24:59,391
that's why we're here.

581
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:02,695
So, everyone, how's
the week been?

582
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:07,633
It's been better.

583
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,740
My mother and I went
to see my dad's grave.

584
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:20,613
So, well, she decided
to start a scholarship

585
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,451
in his name, so.

586
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,521
That's wonderful,

587
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:30,422
and I'm sure he'd be very proud.

588
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:31,724
Thank you for sharing, Ricky.

589
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,426
How's your week been, Ava?

590
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,596
Oh, mine, mine actually
has been really good.

591
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:39,465
I've had more good
days than bad,

592
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:41,267
which I never
thought would happen.

593
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,336
We're actually planning a
trip to see Ryan's parents

594
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,204
this weekend, so.

595
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,674
[John] That sounds
like a wonderful trip.

596
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,011
Yeah, I might be
missing a few meetings.

597
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:53,779
Oh, well, that's okay.

598
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:54,980
Certainly a good reason.

599
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:55,781
Yeah.

600
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:57,016
[John chuckling]

601
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,984
Andy, how's your
week been, sir?

602
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,624
You know, I'm still
having a hard time.

603
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,261
You know, sometimes I still
feel angry about it all,

604
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:11,597
him dying and me surviving.

605
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:15,301
But my mom was actually
going through his stuff,

606
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,637
and she found this dictionary.

607
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,338
It's the dictionary,
we used to use it,

608
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,507
to make our own language.

609
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:24,644
When I looked at it,
something clicked.

610
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:26,545
Just realized he
was a part of me.

611
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:30,382
[John] And how has that
impacted your healing?

612
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,252
Well, I can at
least talk about him.

613
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:35,554
You know, that's
a big step for me.

614
00:26:35,588 --> 00:26:36,855
That's a great start.

615
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:41,160
You know, continuing to
remember our loved ones out loud

616
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:43,796
is always so helpful, you know?

617
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:45,497
It keeps them right
in our hearts.

618
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:46,700
Yeah.

619
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,367
It hasn't been easy,
but I've been trying.

620
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:50,603
Lindsay, how you been?

621
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:53,572
Honestly, I'm okay.

622
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:56,342
You know, I know my
mom's always with me,

623
00:26:56,375 --> 00:27:00,714
and my dad and I, we did
some things in her memory.

624
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:04,383
And I guess I'm just not
as angry as I was before.

625
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:08,520
That's great to hear.

626
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:10,289
I'm happy to hear
with your progress.

627
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,626
I'm really proud of all of you.

628
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,395
You know, these, these
reports are great, you know?

629
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:18,897
I'd actually like to
take a time of prayer.

630
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:20,966
Bow our heads in prayer.

631
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,039
Heavenly father, we thank you

632
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:29,241
for this wonderful
night you've given us.

633
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,610
Thank you for reminding us

634
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:33,879
that your mercies
are new every day.

635
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:34,913
It says in the book of Matthew,

636
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:37,449
that blessed are
those who mourn,

637
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:38,817
for they will be shown mercy.

638
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:42,788
We pray that your grace
continuously follows us

639
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:44,423
through our day.

640
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,726
And we pray that
you bless our going

641
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,094
as you blessed our
coming here tonight.

642
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:50,029
Thank you.

643
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:52,097
It's in your name we pray.

644
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:52,931
Amen.

645
00:27:57,002 --> 00:28:00,172
[upbeat guitar music]

646
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:06,278
Dad, Dad.

647
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:07,179
[Daniel] Yeah.

648
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:08,180
Teach me to play guitar.

649
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:10,549
What now?

650
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:11,685
Yeah, I wanna write
songs like you do.

651
00:28:11,718 --> 00:28:12,518
Look.

652
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:14,620
What have you got?

653
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:17,556
[strings twanging]

654
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:20,660
[chuckles] This is pretty good.

655
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:23,763
Yeah, it's for Mom.

656
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:24,764
You know what,
here, you got it.

657
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:26,498
Here, give me that guitar.

658
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:27,866
Take the old man's guitar.

659
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,602
Do you remember that E minor
chord that I showed you

660
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:31,370
- a while back?
- Yeah.

661
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:32,237
Yeah?

662
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:33,038
Let's see what you got.

663
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:34,973
Here, take the pick.

664
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:35,874
Try that.

665
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:36,810
[strings twanging]

666
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,177
Yeah, you're right on the mark.

667
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:38,977
Let's do another one.

668
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,212
Do you remember D7?

669
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:42,915
Yeah, one there.

670
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:44,850
Actually, no, put
this finger up here.

671
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:46,985
Hit that.

672
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,822
See how that works?
[strings twanging]

673
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:49,922
Not bad, could be better.

674
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:52,991
- [Daniel laughs]
- Very good!

675
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,829
[gentle music]

676
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,065
Hey, there you go.

677
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,200
Thank you.

678
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,569
Of course, you're welcome.

679
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:07,841
So, did you enjoy
group last time?

680
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:10,075
I dunno, I'm starting
to really like it.

681
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:11,678
Like, it's helping me.

682
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:12,846
Me too.

683
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,880
I didn't think I could
stop feeling angry

684
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:16,014
or guilty about it all,

685
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,217
but little by little, I am.

686
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,985
That's good.

687
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:21,086
Oh, there's Katie.

688
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:23,122
Katie's here.

689
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:25,891
Hi.

690
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:26,892
Hey, Katie.

691
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:27,727
Hi, hi.

692
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,197
Katie, this is
Andrew from group.

693
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:35,167
Andrew, this is Katie,
from like my whole life.

694
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,168
[Andrew] Hi,
hi, how you doing?

695
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:37,436
[Katie] Hi.

696
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:39,905
So, you're the one that
eats all the cookies.

697
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,741
Um, how did you know?

698
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:44,977
[Katie] I heard. [laughs]

699
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:48,480
[Andrew] Hmm.

700
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,254
Hey, Dad.

701
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:56,321
Oh hey, pumpkin.

702
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:57,356
How was your day?

703
00:29:57,389 --> 00:29:58,257
It was great.

704
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,057
Oh, that's right,

705
00:29:59,091 --> 00:29:59,859
it was your third date.

706
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:00,860
How'd it go?

707
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:02,361
Dad, it's not a date.

708
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:06,532
Alright, alright, it
wasn't a date. [laughs]

709
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:08,934
Look, I got some dinner in
the fridge for you, alright?

710
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,269
Don't be up too late,
school tomorrow.

711
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:11,236
I won't.

712
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,037
- Thanks, Dad.
- Alright, alright.

713
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,938
Goodnight.

714
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,910
We're gonna be okay, Abby, girl.

715
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,082
[gentle music]

716
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:26,018
So, I was thinking we
could go to Mayfields.

717
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:27,854
I heard they have a sale, so.

718
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:31,891
Katie, Katie, are you okay?

719
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:34,828
Sorry, what?

720
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:38,397
Is everything alright?

721
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:41,801
No, not really.

722
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,271
Okay, I can just pull over.

723
00:30:52,946 --> 00:30:53,813
What's going on?

724
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,348
Everything, Lindsey.

725
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:58,852
Tell me.

726
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:03,622
My mom has cancer.

727
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:06,024
Stage four.

728
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:08,994
[Lindsey] What?

729
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:12,632
I'm trying to be
strong. [sniffles]

730
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:13,766
We just found out.

731
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,970
It's bad, but she said
she's going to fight.

732
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:19,238
I'm so sorry.
[Katie sobbing]

733
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:20,572
God, I can't even...

734
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,809
I don't know what to do.

735
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,979
I don't want her
to see me crying.

736
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,112
I'm so scared.

737
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:29,581
Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.

738
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:31,951
I'm gonna be here for
you no matter what, okay?

739
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:36,890
Thank you.

740
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:41,995
How about we talk
about some happy stuff?

741
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,663
Okay.

742
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,900
Isn't that, what's his face
who's taking you to prom,

743
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:47,867
that guy?

744
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:48,935
Brett.

745
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:52,538
Brett, the
basketball guy, yeah.

746
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:54,473
He hasn't asked me yet,

747
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,508
but I was thinking it'd be fun

748
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,344
if just a bunch of
us went together.

749
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,546
Yeah, gonna be fine.

750
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,214
We can get a limo,
ride in style.

751
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:07,020
Love you, girl.

752
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,053
It's gonna be okay.

753
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,927
[Katie sniffling]

754
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:18,765
[gentle music]

755
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,733
So, you excited
for prom tonight?

756
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:21,567
Yeah.

757
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:23,903
Do you think it's weird,

758
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:25,137
Lindsey and I decided
not to go with any boys,

759
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,539
and just go with
our girlfriends?

760
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:29,042
Oh, yeah, it's so weird, Kat,

761
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,578
but better for your dad and I.

762
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:34,013
Now, we don't have to do

763
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:37,549
that whole crazy father
parent thing that dads do.

764
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:42,588
[doorbell ringing]

765
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,523
Here's the lovely
Miss Lindsey.

766
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:45,324
[Lindsey] Hi!

767
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,426
I'll be right back.

768
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:49,227
[Lindsey] Hello,
Sara, how are you doing?

769
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,863
I'm fighting hard.

770
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:52,097
It's good to see you.

771
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,033
[Lindsey] It's
good to see you too.

772
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:55,233
Why don't we go get ready?

773
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,803
[Lindsey] Okay, bye.

774
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:58,203
You girls have fun.

775
00:32:58,236 --> 00:32:59,237
[Katie] Thank you, Mom.

776
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,946
[Lindsey] Sorry, I
left my makeup bag.

777
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,082
Actually, I'm
glad you're here.

778
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:10,683
Can you sit with
me for a minute?

779
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,086
Yeah, of course.

780
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,087
What's wrong?

781
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,121
I need your help, Lindsey.

782
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:17,790
I don't have long.

783
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:21,027
I'm struggling with it.

784
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:26,131
And I know that Katie is not
gonna do well when I'm gone.

785
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:29,769
I wanna do something for her,

786
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,105
that'll bring her comfort

787
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,108
you know, during important
times in her life.

788
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:39,344
Will you help me make a
video message for her?

789
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:42,314
Yeah.

790
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:44,117
Yeah, of course.

791
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,351
And don't tell her.

792
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:49,154
I'll entrust them to you,

793
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:52,792
and you just make
sure she gets them

794
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,128
when the time's right, okay?

795
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,665
Okay.

796
00:33:58,698 --> 00:33:59,832
Okay.

797
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:00,933
You go on, get ready.

798
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:05,504
I'll contact you to set
up a day and time soon.

799
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,141
I'll see you.

800
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:09,809
Bye.

801
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,882
- Tom?
- Yes, dear.

802
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,684
Can you bring me
my Bible, please?

803
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,121
Anything for you, my love.

804
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:26,491
You mind if I read with you?

805
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,325
No.

806
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,402
[melancholic music]

807
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:40,305
Oh, oh, thank you.

808
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,644
Katie sure did look
beautiful for the prom tonight,

809
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:45,444
didn't she?

810
00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:46,244
Oh, she did.

811
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:51,718
There you go.

812
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:56,789
[Sara groaning]

813
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:58,024
Thank you, honey.

814
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:59,892
Huh, for what?

815
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:01,293
You know.

816
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:02,527
What, for loving you?

817
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:05,564
I love you, Tom.

818
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:10,036
And I know you're going
to do the right thing,

819
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:12,337
and raise our daughter right.

820
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:15,141
I'm not giving
up on you, Sara.

821
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:21,279
I know.

822
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:38,631
Thank you for this, Lindsey.

823
00:35:38,664 --> 00:35:39,832
You're welcome, Sara.

824
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,169
I know how much this
is gonna mean to Katie.

825
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,270
Right.

826
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:48,273
It means everything to me too.

827
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:52,979
I don't have much
I can leave her,

828
00:35:54,513 --> 00:35:58,885
but reminders of how
proud I am of her,

829
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:01,788
how much I love her,

830
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,758
bring me some peace.

831
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,592
She's gonna be here
in about 30 minutes,

832
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:10,263
so we should get started.

833
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:15,101
I'm just gonna put
some lipstick on.

834
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:16,235
Of course,

835
00:36:24,677 --> 00:36:25,778
How does that look?

836
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,281
You look beautiful.

837
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,787
Okay, I'm ready when you are.

838
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:42,094
Katie, when you
receive this message,

839
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:49,068
I'll be with God and our
savior, Jesus Christ,

840
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,536
in heaven and free of pain.

841
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:59,212
I will always be watching
over you in spirit.

842
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,283
And today is such a special day.

843
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:09,322
You're graduating from
high school with honors,

844
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:13,358
and I'm so proud of you.

845
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,495
I want you to enjoy it,

846
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:25,370
and take tons of pictures with
your friends and your dad.

847
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,373
And enjoy that moment,

848
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:30,575
when you move your tassel,

849
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:33,913
and throw your hat in the air.

850
00:37:37,283 --> 00:37:41,386
Going to UF is going
to be amazing for you,

851
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:46,025
and I hope that you have

852
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:49,262
a memorable college
experience, honey.

853
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:56,434
Katie, please try and
go to church regularly.

854
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:01,406
Read your Bible and pray.

855
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,945
I've left my Bible for you,

856
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:13,551
and I've had Pastor Mark notate
all my favorite Bible verses

857
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,122
for you to reference,

858
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:20,126
and give you strength.

859
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,197
I will always be with you.

860
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:30,703
I love you, Katie.

861
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:35,875
[Sara sniffling]

862
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,416
Okay, I got it.

863
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:49,088
Lindsey, I have
one more favor.

864
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:51,424
Yeah.

865
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:54,794
Anything.

866
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:58,898
I got a graduation
card for Katie.

867
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:05,271
Can you make sure she gets
it when she graduates?

868
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,443
Yeah, of course.

869
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:16,449
But you'll be able to
give it to her, right?

870
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,454
Appreciate it.

871
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:25,958
[Lindsey sniffling]

872
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:32,264
Thank you so much
for sharing, Rick,

873
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:34,200
and let's put that
in your memory book.

874
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:36,469
Hello, Lindsey.

875
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:39,872
- Hi.
- Hey, Lindsey.

876
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm sorry I'm late.
[gentle music]

877
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:43,242
I was helping my friend's
mom with something.

878
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:44,143
No, that's okay.

879
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:45,177
Sometimes we have things to do.

880
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:46,445
Don't worry about it.

881
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:48,180
Well, it wouldn't be
the same without you.

882
00:39:49,448 --> 00:39:51,751
I'm having a hard
time with this one.

883
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:52,617
Why?

884
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,957
It's my best friend's
mom, she's dying,

885
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,760
and I'm trying to do
something special for Katie

886
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:03,496
so she can have something
after she's gone.

887
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:06,132
Well, that's very
sweet of you to help her.

888
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,233
But are you okay?

889
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:12,738
I am, but I can't stop
thinking about my mom.

890
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:16,742
Sometimes, it's just like
I lost her all over again.

891
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:21,213
Well, I'm sure what
you're doing to help Katie

892
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:22,580
will bring her great comfort.

893
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,986
Well, I'm helping her mom
make a video message for her,

894
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:28,387
and I still have to edit it

895
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:29,688
with some of her mom's
favorite pictures at the end.

896
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:33,426
But, I don't know.

897
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,260
I like that.

898
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:37,430
I'd love to see
my brother again.

899
00:40:38,431 --> 00:40:39,932
Or my baby.

900
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:40,766
Or my husband.

901
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:42,735
My father.

902
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:44,703
My mom.

903
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,474
You know, I think
we all have someone

904
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:50,509
whose voice we'd
love to hear again.

905
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:54,180
I think it's very sweet of
you to help your friend.

906
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:56,749
And you know, you could always
invite Katie here, you know?

907
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:59,351
She doesn't have to wait
until her mother passes

908
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:00,753
to get support.

909
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:02,088
I don't know.

910
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:03,556
She's not ready to deal
with her mom dying yet.

911
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:07,293
And Sara's still fighting.

912
00:41:08,127 --> 00:41:09,195
Maybe she'll make it.

913
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:10,796
It's true.

914
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,630
We'll be praying.

915
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:13,799
Thanks.

916
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:16,435
Ava would you like
[phone ringing]

917
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:17,236
to continue with your story?

918
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,170
[Ava] Alright.

919
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:19,138
[John] Oh, why
don't you go ahead

920
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:20,005
and check that?

921
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:20,773
It doesn't happen often,

922
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:22,208
it might be important.

923
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:22,975
I'm so sorry.

924
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:24,844
I have to go.

925
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:25,644
No worries.

926
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,888
Where are you?

927
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:40,726
[Daniel sighs]

928
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:41,560
Dad, what happened?

929
00:41:41,594 --> 00:41:42,528
You're scaring me.

930
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,602
Katie's mom passed away.

931
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,703
Oh, I need to go see her.

932
00:41:50,736 --> 00:41:51,937
No, no, no, no, no,
listen, you can't.

933
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,539
They're at the hospital.

934
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:55,040
You're not gonna be able
to see them until tomorrow.

935
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:55,841
I'm sorry.

936
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,613
We finished just in time.
[melancholic music]

937
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,315
What, what did you, what?

938
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:04,583
What?

939
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:06,485
Her mom and I, we made
this video for Katie

940
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:07,686
for her graduation.

941
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:10,656
It's like, she knew.

942
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,793
That's gonna mean
the world to her.

943
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:17,563
It's like losing
Mom all over again.

944
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:18,330
Yeah, I know.

945
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:19,431
That's why I wanted to-

946
00:42:19,465 --> 00:42:20,766
- Hey, Dad, I really, I
really need to be alone.

947
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,701
No, no, no just wait.

948
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,906
[Daniel sighs]

949
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:42,855
This is so beautiful, Mom.

950
00:42:44,658 --> 00:42:46,660
I wonder what you
would have said to me.

951
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:49,895
But I know this will help Katie.

952
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:52,632
I just know.

953
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:24,029
I think Mom would
have liked the ceremony.

954
00:43:24,063 --> 00:43:25,731
Yeah, I think so too.

955
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:33,038
Does the pain ever go away?

956
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,208
Honestly?

957
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:38,210
It does and it doesn't.

958
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:42,548
We'll never stop missing them.

959
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:45,719
I don't know how you did it.

960
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,519
It's so hard.

961
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:53,025
Time, remember
the good things.

962
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:54,860
[air whooshing]

963
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,895
Mom, do you think I can do it?

964
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:57,763
[Abby] You can do it, Lindsey.

965
00:43:57,796 --> 00:43:58,864
I believe in you.

966
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:03,435
[water splashing]

967
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:04,903
[air whooshing]

968
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:07,006
[Lindsey] I guess
that sometimes helps.

969
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,643
We graduate in one month.

970
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:13,680
She wanted to be
here so bad for that.

971
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:15,214
Just one more month.

972
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:20,486
I know this probably
won't mean much right now,

973
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,491
but I truly believe
that she's here with us.

974
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:28,762
She's with God now.

975
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,064
[gentle music]

976
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:33,098
It's not the same.

977
00:44:39,773 --> 00:44:40,539
Hey.

978
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:48,782
Just, I wonder why
she's not here yet.

979
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:50,115
She's never late.

980
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:51,350
I don't know.

981
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:53,218
Maybe call her?

982
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,620
I don't know.

983
00:44:54,654 --> 00:44:55,821
I have a really bad
feeling about this,

984
00:44:55,854 --> 00:44:57,589
like she's not okay.

985
00:44:57,623 --> 00:44:58,991
I'm sure she's alright.

986
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:00,592
Just call her.

987
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:01,527
Okay, well.

988
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:03,797
[phone buzzing]

989
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,164
Oh, I bet that's her now.

990
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,005
Everything okay?

991
00:45:13,038 --> 00:45:14,139
No, it's not.

992
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:15,809
Katie's not okay.

993
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,942
[Andrew] What happened?

994
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,077
She said she's not coming.

995
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,912
She said she can't stop crying.

996
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,816
It's gonna be alright.

997
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:24,651
[Lindsey] What should I do?

998
00:45:24,684 --> 00:45:26,151
What can you do?

999
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:28,887
I mean, I can go give her
the message from her mom.

1000
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,590
I know it's supposed to
be for the graduation,

1001
00:45:31,623 --> 00:45:34,694
but I think she needs it now.

1002
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:35,829
You sure?

1003
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,029
I mean, it is your party.

1004
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:40,165
You sure?

1005
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't know.

1006
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,969
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

1007
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,371
I just don't understand.

1008
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:46,972
Hey, hey, hey, you know what?

1009
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:49,375
You know what, listen,

1010
00:45:49,408 --> 00:45:50,876
I'll finish these
decorations up,

1011
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:52,277
and you go see Katie.

1012
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:53,879
Deliver that message to her.

1013
00:45:53,912 --> 00:45:54,814
Are you sure?

1014
00:45:54,848 --> 00:45:55,815
I'm sure, alright.

1015
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:57,616
Parties come and go,

1016
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,151
but best friends are forever.

1017
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:00,185
Thank you.

1018
00:46:01,086 --> 00:46:04,089
[Lindsey sniffling]

1019
00:46:14,933 --> 00:46:17,837
[hopeful music]

1020
00:46:17,871 --> 00:46:18,838
Katie.

1021
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:21,473
Lindsey.

1022
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:23,275
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1023
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,779
I'm not so sure.

1024
00:46:28,313 --> 00:46:30,416
I'm not ready to
be without my mom.

1025
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,886
I know, I know,
but she's with you.

1026
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:33,952
How would you know?

1027
00:46:34,953 --> 00:46:36,422
I have something for you?

1028
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,925
I was supposed to give it
to you after graduation,

1029
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,059
but I don't think
your mom would mind

1030
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:41,994
if I gave it to you now.

1031
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:43,095
What do you mean, my mom?

1032
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:44,864
It's from your mom.

1033
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:46,031
She made it for you.

1034
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:47,032
What is this about?

1035
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:48,100
What is this?

1036
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:48,934
Just trust me.

1037
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:53,272
Watch it.

1038
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:57,309
Katie, when you
receive this message,

1039
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:03,783
I'll be with God and our
savior, Jesus Christ,

1040
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:06,552
in heaven and free of pain.

1041
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:13,927
I will always be watching
over you in spirit.

1042
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,097
Today is such a special day.

1043
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:23,602
You're graduating from
high school with honors,

1044
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,006
and I'm so proud of you.

1045
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:32,812
I want you to enjoy it.

1046
00:47:32,846 --> 00:47:33,947
I'm sorry, Katie.

1047
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:35,949
I didn't mean to make
you cry like this.

1048
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:37,282
- Take tons of pictures
- No.

1049
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:38,984
[Sara] with your
friends and your dad.

1050
00:47:39,017 --> 00:47:40,619
No, it's just so beautiful.

1051
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:43,555
And enjoy that moment.
[hopeful music]

1052
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:44,824
I miss her so much.

1053
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:45,692
[Sara] When you
move your tassel.

1054
00:47:45,725 --> 00:47:46,926
Thank you.

1055
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,827
- Yeah.
- And throw your hat

1056
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:49,461
in the air.

1057
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,330
Kat, you should come to
group with me sometime.

1058
00:47:51,363 --> 00:47:52,130
Maybe.

1059
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:53,198
Going to you UF,

1060
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,367
- I'll just take it
- is going to be

1061
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,602
- one day at a time.
- amazing for you.

1062
00:47:56,636 --> 00:47:57,436
Okay.

1063
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:58,237
[Sara] Katie.

1064
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,907
Oh, open your card.

1065
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,877
[Sara] Please try and
go to church regularly.

1066
00:48:05,043 --> 00:48:05,979
Read your Bible.

1067
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:12,819
I, I've left my Bible for you.

1068
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:15,955
Thank you.

1069
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:17,155
[Sara] And I've
had Pastor Mark,

1070
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:18,490
I have to go and show
Dad, but thank you!

1071
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:19,692
- notate all my favorite
- Thank you so much.

1072
00:48:19,726 --> 00:48:20,894
- readings,
- I really needed this.

1073
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:22,795
[Sara] for you to reference

1074
00:48:25,097 --> 00:48:26,365
and give you strength.

1075
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:31,470
Dad, Dad, look, you
have to come watch!

1076
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:32,304
[Tom] What's happening?

1077
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:33,438
Look, just come watch.

1078
00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:36,976
What is it?

1079
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,878
Just watch, trust me.

1080
00:48:38,912 --> 00:48:41,014
[Sara] And I'm
so proud of you.

1081
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:45,417
I want you to enjoy it.

1082
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,720
That's...

1083
00:48:48,888 --> 00:48:49,789
Mom.

1084
00:48:49,822 --> 00:48:50,990
[Sara] Take tons of pictures.

1085
00:48:51,024 --> 00:48:53,693
She left it me
for my graduation.

1086
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:54,994
She remembered me.

1087
00:48:55,028 --> 00:48:57,062
[Sara] And enjoy that moment,

1088
00:48:57,095 --> 00:48:58,397
when you move your tassel.

1089
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,198
She's here with us.

1090
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:01,533
[Sara] And throw
your hat in the air.

1091
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:05,070
And she's with God
watching over us.

1092
00:49:05,103 --> 00:49:06,739
[Sara] Going to UF

1093
00:49:06,773 --> 00:49:08,942
- is going to be amazing
- She loves us.

1094
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:10,509
[Sara] for you.

1095
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:11,343
Katie.

1096
00:49:18,718 --> 00:49:19,484
[door knocking]

1097
00:49:19,518 --> 00:49:20,385
Hey, honey.

1098
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:21,286
Hey, Dad.

1099
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:24,089
Okay, I was just thinking,

1100
00:49:24,122 --> 00:49:27,092
you know that video that
Sara made for Katie?

1101
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,027
Yeah.

1102
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:29,428
I mean, it really helped her.

1103
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:30,997
You know, I thought it was
gonna make her more sad,

1104
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,799
but she was excited,

1105
00:49:32,832 --> 00:49:34,600
and she ran and told her dad.

1106
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:36,268
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

1107
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:38,370
You know, I've
been researching,

1108
00:49:38,403 --> 00:49:40,773
and I wanna do this for
more people, you know?

1109
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:44,176
Do you think I'm too young
to start a nonprofit?

1110
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:46,244
No, no, I don't think so.

1111
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:47,747
Let's do a little research.

1112
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:50,449
With a little faith,

1113
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:52,652
I'm pretty sure you're
the one that can do that.

1114
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:53,552
Thanks, Dad.

1115
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:55,320
[Daniel] Goodnight, alright?

1116
00:49:55,354 --> 00:49:56,154
Night.

1117
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:08,433
[gentle music]

1118
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:09,736
Hey, come sit by me.

1119
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:13,271
Katie, it's good
to see you again.

1120
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:14,139
Thank you.

1121
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:17,644
[John] Katie, you're
Lindsey's friend?

1122
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:20,046
Yeah, since elementary school.

1123
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,280
[John] Oh, well it's great
to have you here with us.

1124
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:23,116
Thank you.

1125
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:27,152
I'm not sure I'm ready
to talk about it yet,

1126
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:29,088
but thank you.

1127
00:50:29,122 --> 00:50:30,089
That's quite alright.

1128
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:31,124
Thank you for being here.

1129
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:32,091
Alright, everyone,

1130
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,092
let's go ahead and get started.

1131
00:50:33,126 --> 00:50:34,426
You know, as always,

1132
00:50:34,459 --> 00:50:35,662
I like to just put a
little reminder out there,

1133
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:37,396
about what we do
here in this group.

1134
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:40,667
Our grief support group is
a place of healing and hope.

1135
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,468
We like to remember our
loved ones out loud.

1136
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:44,737
You know, we share stories,

1137
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:47,172
we share memories good and bad,

1138
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:48,975
and more importantly,
we support each other

1139
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:51,443
and move through
the sadness of loss

1140
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:53,112
to find the comfort

1141
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:55,682
in knowing that our loved
ones remain in our heart,

1142
00:50:55,715 --> 00:50:57,616
and in our memories forever.

1143
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,918
Now, before we get started,

1144
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:01,186
I'd like to have our
guest introduce herself,

1145
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:03,188
and then we'll go ahead
and share some stories.

1146
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:05,658
Hi, everyone, I'm Katie.

1147
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:10,195
I lost my mom to cancer.

1148
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:12,065
I'm just taking it
one day at a time.

1149
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:14,801
Well, thank you for
being here, Katie.

1150
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,535
This is a great
place of healing,

1151
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:18,638
and to know you're not
alone in this process.

1152
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:21,674
Pastor, Katie's the one I
helped make the video for.

1153
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:22,842
Oh, that's great.

1154
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,376
We've heard great things.

1155
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:26,012
How did it make you feel, Katie?

1156
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:30,650
Honestly, until Lindsey
showed me that video,

1157
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:33,152
I didn't know I was
going to be okay.

1158
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:35,822
But seeing my mom and
hearing her voice,

1159
00:51:35,855 --> 00:51:38,658
I felt so close to
her, close to God.

1160
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:40,459
I was angry until that moment.

1161
00:51:41,426 --> 00:51:42,494
I showed my dad right away,

1162
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,197
and we laughed and cried

1163
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:48,400
and pulled out the family
videos and photo albums.

1164
00:51:49,267 --> 00:51:51,204
And I mean, it helped us realize

1165
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:53,740
that my mom was always
going to be with us.

1166
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,809
I just wish Lindsey would've
gotten a video like that

1167
00:51:56,843 --> 00:51:57,777
from her mom.

1168
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,711
[gentle music]

1169
00:51:58,745 --> 00:51:59,578
Me too.

1170
00:52:02,215 --> 00:52:03,716
[John] Yeah.

1171
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,220
Well, I mean, I bet everyone
would like to hear a message

1172
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:08,386
from their loved ones.

1173
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:14,694
I think that's a
wonderful legacy to leave,

1174
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:18,231
you know, for
anyone's loved one.

1175
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:21,067
Yeah, I think getting a
message from your loved one

1176
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,601
can be really comforting.

1177
00:52:22,635 --> 00:52:24,237
- The legacy of love.
- Yeah.

1178
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,072
Pastor, I've been
thinking about this a lot,

1179
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:27,439
and I think there's a way

1180
00:52:27,472 --> 00:52:30,542
that we can channel all of
our pain and our suffering,

1181
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:32,111
into something that
can help others

1182
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:34,213
who are grieving
like us one day.

1183
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:35,313
What do you mean?

1184
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:36,749
Well, I've been researching,

1185
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:39,252
and I think a nonprofit
could be created.

1186
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,520
Call it the Living
Legacy of Love.

1187
00:52:41,553 --> 00:52:44,123
We can reach out to those who
soon may be transitioning,

1188
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:46,959
and help them leave messages
for their loved ones.

1189
00:52:46,993 --> 00:52:48,127
I'd be down.

1190
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:49,095
You could help out
a lot of people.

1191
00:52:49,128 --> 00:52:50,897
- Yeah.
- I'd be game.

1192
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,265
We should do it.

1193
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:53,266
Wait, what?

1194
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:57,770
Do you really think that
you can help these people?

1195
00:52:57,804 --> 00:53:00,338
What if you cause more pain?

1196
00:53:00,372 --> 00:53:02,775
Like, are you really
thinking this through?

1197
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:03,943
I hadn't thought about that.

1198
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,411
I just know what I
witnessed with Katie.

1199
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:09,347
Yeah, I mean, I get
what you're saying,

1200
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:13,186
but what if it actually
does provide comfort?

1201
00:53:13,219 --> 00:53:14,187
What if?

1202
00:53:15,288 --> 00:53:16,722
You don't know that.

1203
00:53:16,756 --> 00:53:17,957
I understand where
you're coming from,

1204
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,826
but I think it could
bring more love,

1205
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:21,828
and a reminder to
a deeper connection

1206
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:23,129
with those who passed on.

1207
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,596
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

1208
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,998
[John] Well, I'd
like to know more.

1209
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:26,866
Yeah.

1210
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:30,970
I'm not saying I
don't approve of this,

1211
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:37,310
but what if you're reminding
them of what they lost?

1212
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:39,645
I can't speak
for other people,

1213
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,015
but that message
gave me strength.

1214
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:43,850
It gave me hope.

1215
00:53:45,051 --> 00:53:46,819
[Ava] I mean,
it's worth a shot.

1216
00:53:46,853 --> 00:53:49,121
Losing someone you love
is just too painful.

1217
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:52,258
How do we start?

1218
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,327
Well, we start where
there's the most need.

1219
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:58,297
Hospice, hospitals,
assisted living, you know,

1220
00:53:58,331 --> 00:53:59,699
things like that.

1221
00:53:59,732 --> 00:54:02,467
Yeah, and we can, we can,

1222
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,036
[Andrew And Lindsey]
We could make flyers!

1223
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,972
Yeah, and we can let
them know it's free, and-

1224
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:06,939
- That'd be so cool.

1225
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:08,074
And I bet a lot of
people would help out.

1226
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:08,908
[Lindsey] Yeah, totally.

1227
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:11,543
I'm not crazy about the idea,

1228
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:16,148
but I work at an
assisted living facility.

1229
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:19,752
I can ask if you can
speak with the residents.

1230
00:54:19,785 --> 00:54:21,220
You can bring your flyers.

1231
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:23,356
That would be so awesome.

1232
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,390
I do know that
the community center

1233
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:27,360
rents out camera equipment
from time to time.

1234
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:28,560
I can talk to them.

1235
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:29,862
And, you know, I mean, you know,

1236
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:31,264
I think we should
do this, you know?

1237
00:54:31,297 --> 00:54:33,531
But we have to make sure
we do it the right way.

1238
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,500
Okay, well, my
dad's already set up.

1239
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,469
He's trying to get
the nonprofit rolling.

1240
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:40,039
And it'd be great if
you all wanted to join.

1241
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,074
I wanna help.

1242
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:45,044
It's brought me so much comfort.

1243
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:45,878
I want to.

1244
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:48,413
You know, I'll go ahead

1245
00:54:48,446 --> 00:54:49,916
and get in contact
with your father.

1246
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:52,351
That way we can kind of have
this thing all taken care of.

1247
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:54,353
And you know, I'd like to
talk about it more in depth

1248
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:55,955
after the, after group, okay?

1249
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:58,357
Thank you.

1250
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:00,893
[gentle music]

1251
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,702
Pastor John, I have good news.

1252
00:55:09,735 --> 00:55:11,103
Well, you must
have with that smile.

1253
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:12,405
Go ahead and tell me.

1254
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:14,240
My dad says a
Living Legacy of Love

1255
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,042
is ready to begin
helping people.

1256
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:17,376
Well, that is good news.

1257
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,443
Okay, well, let's
let everybody know

1258
00:55:18,476 --> 00:55:20,313
to get ready to
distribute these flyers,

1259
00:55:20,346 --> 00:55:22,181
and we can start
spreading the word.

1260
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:24,449
Well here, what do
you think of this?

1261
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:27,286
I love it.

1262
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,354
Well, good.

1263
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:29,454
Call Katie and Andy,

1264
00:55:29,487 --> 00:55:30,588
let them know the
flyers are ready,

1265
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:31,857
and the shirts will
be done in a few days.

1266
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:32,658
I will.

1267
00:55:32,692 --> 00:55:34,393
We need to put these everywhere.

1268
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:36,262
I hope people will respond.

1269
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,630
I believe they will.

1270
00:55:37,663 --> 00:55:38,463
I do too.

1271
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:44,070
[gentle music]

1272
00:55:44,103 --> 00:55:46,439
Hey, Pastor John, I
put flyers everywhere.

1273
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:47,273
Oh, good work, Andy.

1274
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,274
Thank you.

1275
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:49,075
Now what?

1276
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:50,810
Do we do more flyers?

1277
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:53,079
Guys, why hasn't
anyone called yet?

1278
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:54,780
Maybe I'm wrong.

1279
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:56,481
No, you're not wrong.

1280
00:55:56,514 --> 00:55:57,984
Ladies, have faith, you know?

1281
00:55:58,017 --> 00:55:58,951
We're meant to help people.

1282
00:55:58,985 --> 00:56:00,485
Just give it some time.

1283
00:56:00,518 --> 00:56:03,255
[phone ringing]

1284
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:10,696
Hi, this is the
Living Legacy of Love.

1285
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:14,400
[Woman] Hi, can
I talk to Lindsey?

1286
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:15,500
This is Lindsey.

1287
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,637
Well, Lindsey, I
just got your flyer,

1288
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:21,140
and I would like
to record a message

1289
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,441
for my daughter.

1290
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:23,476
Yeah, of course.

1291
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,277
What time do you
want us to come?

1292
00:56:26,712 --> 00:56:28,280
Wednesday at six?

1293
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:30,016
Okay, we'll be there.

1294
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,183
Thank you so much.

1295
00:56:32,885 --> 00:56:35,688
Guys, we just got
our first client.

1296
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:37,123
- [groups applauding]
- Wow.

1297
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:38,523
- Let's go!
- That's awesome.

1298
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:39,392
Go!

1299
00:56:40,826 --> 00:56:42,128
[John] That's very awesome.

1300
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,630
[men laughing]

1301
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:50,736
Hey, Brian, nice to meet you.

1302
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,771
[Brian] Hey, how
you doing, man?

1303
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:53,039
- Good, good.
- Hey, Brian.

1304
00:56:53,072 --> 00:56:54,273
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you guys?

1305
00:56:54,306 --> 00:56:56,776
- Good.
- Oh man, I've been better.

1306
00:56:56,809 --> 00:56:58,576
I love what you guys do here.

1307
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,478
[John] Well, we're
glad you're here.

1308
00:56:59,512 --> 00:57:00,413
Thank you.

1309
00:57:00,446 --> 00:57:01,447
We'll give you a hand with-

1310
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,415
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

1311
00:57:02,448 --> 00:57:03,449
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1312
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:04,750
Thank you, you're too kind.

1313
00:57:05,851 --> 00:57:08,487
[Brian groaning]

1314
00:57:08,521 --> 00:57:09,488
How you doing, man?

1315
00:57:09,522 --> 00:57:10,890
Oh, I've been a little better.

1316
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:14,026
But, one day at a time.

1317
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,396
But hey, I was wondering,

1318
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:20,565
can you visit my
little brother for me?

1319
00:57:20,598 --> 00:57:22,168
He's gonna need someone

1320
00:57:22,201 --> 00:57:24,503
to teach him how
to ride his board.

1321
00:57:24,537 --> 00:57:25,838
- Yeah.
- You know,

1322
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:29,208
it was only the beginning
before this happened.

1323
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,509
Yeah, yeah, I got you.

1324
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:32,211
What's his name?

1325
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:33,712
His name is Jake.

1326
00:57:33,746 --> 00:57:36,182
Yeah, yeah, I'll
deliver it myself.

1327
00:57:36,215 --> 00:57:37,516
Oh, thank you, man, thank you.

1328
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,186
Oh, one more thing?

1329
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,153
Yeah, what is it?

1330
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:44,090
50, actually.

1331
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:45,891
[Andrew] What do you mean?

1332
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:47,526
It's, it's for my dad.

1333
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,762
[gentle music]

1334
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:51,964
Yeah, there's a few notes
and whatnot for my mom,

1335
00:57:51,997 --> 00:57:54,467
but his birthday is next month.

1336
00:57:58,904 --> 00:58:00,306
[Lindsey] That's so sweet.

1337
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,741
Thanks.

1338
00:58:02,775 --> 00:58:05,311
Hopefully he can get
some laughs out of it.

1339
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:08,047
You know, we are pretty close,

1340
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,016
and he hasn't been
taking this very well.

1341
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:13,719
[Brian coughing]

1342
00:58:16,922 --> 00:58:19,624
Well, Brian, we're
actually just about ready.

1343
00:58:19,658 --> 00:58:20,626
How you doing?

1344
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,095
Oh, I've been better,

1345
00:58:23,129 --> 00:58:24,396
but I'm gonna say,

1346
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,765
this is, this is great.

1347
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:31,203
I'm just thankful I
could even do this.

1348
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,539
Hopefully it brings
me some peace.

1349
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:35,341
Well, before we
all start crying,

1350
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:37,877
Brian, you ready?

1351
00:58:39,178 --> 00:58:43,015
[Brian] [sighs]
Just tell me when.

1352
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:45,584
[Ricky] Whenever you're
ready, the camera's rolling.

1353
00:58:45,618 --> 00:58:46,452
Alright.

1354
00:58:48,587 --> 00:58:53,526
So, Dad, I hear you're
turning 50 next month, man.

1355
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:56,228
[Brian chuckles]

1356
00:58:56,262 --> 00:58:57,596
Oh, geez.

1357
00:58:57,631 --> 00:58:59,633
Looks like you're heading
over that hill, huh?

1358
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,637
Look, I just, I just wanted
to wish you happy birthday.

1359
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:09,308
Mom, give the old man a
hug from me, yeah? [laughs]

1360
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:12,044
[Brian coughing]

1361
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:18,317
Look, Mom, I'm sure when
you had children, you know,

1362
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:25,224
this wasn't exactly what you
had in mind for our future

1363
00:59:25,424 --> 00:59:26,225
or anything.

1364
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:33,432
But I just want to
let you know, [coughs]

1365
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:42,174
even though my
time here is short,

1366
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:49,748
I had a wonderful life.

1367
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:52,985
I couldn't have asked
for a better family.

1368
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:58,190
I'm always gonna be
watching over you, kid.

1369
00:59:59,258 --> 01:00:00,593
Because God has a plan.

1370
01:00:02,962 --> 01:00:04,664
So, remember these two things,

1371
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:09,768
keep your faith,

1372
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:12,805
and I will always love you.

1373
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:22,181
Thank you for giving me
such a wonderful life.

1374
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:39,798
[gentle music]

1375
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:41,000
He was really sweet.

1376
01:00:42,736 --> 01:00:43,502
He was.

1377
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:47,439
It must be hard for them,

1378
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:49,308
not having their parents
know who they are.

1379
01:00:51,143 --> 01:00:53,112
I mean, at least
they have each other.

1380
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,650
Yeah.

1381
01:00:56,683 --> 01:00:58,652
Me and Josh really needed
each other when my mom died.

1382
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:01,553
I never realized just how much.

1383
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:05,759
No, it isn't easy
what we're doing.

1384
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:10,796
It, you know, it doesn't make
the pain and loss go away.

1385
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:14,466
But I hope that it makes
them feel less alone.

1386
01:01:15,434 --> 01:01:18,270
Yeah, me too.

1387
01:01:27,446 --> 01:01:29,749
I can't believe we've
already helped 50 people.

1388
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:30,816
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.

1389
01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:32,418
We've helped a
lot of people out.

1390
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,887
Like, I was thinking people,
like, wouldn't like my idea,

1391
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,823
but it's helped people so
much to see their loved ones,

1392
01:01:37,856 --> 01:01:38,957
- you know?
- Yeah, yeah,

1393
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:40,959
I mean, we're impacting
a lot of lives.

1394
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:43,829
A lot of people are gonna be
impacted by what we're doing.

1395
01:01:43,862 --> 01:01:45,097
And there's hundreds more.

1396
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,800
It can never end.

1397
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:47,933
We could do this forever.

1398
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:49,368
Yeah.

1399
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:50,202
I can't.

1400
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:52,438
[gentle music]

1401
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:53,640
Hey Linds?

1402
01:01:53,673 --> 01:01:55,207
[Lindsey] Yeah?

1403
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:59,111
I was thinking maybe, maybe
we can go to dinner sometime?

1404
01:01:59,144 --> 01:02:00,279
- Hang out a bit.
- That'd be fun.

1405
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:02,816
We can invite Katie.

1406
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:03,783
Hey.

1407
01:02:03,817 --> 01:02:04,651
Hey, Ricky.

1408
01:02:05,551 --> 01:02:06,985
- Got my camera.
- What's up?

1409
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:09,621
Yeah, we're good.

1410
01:02:09,656 --> 01:02:12,191
Yeah, but I was
thinking more me and you,

1411
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:13,359
more of a me and you thing.

1412
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:14,960
Not really all of us.

1413
01:02:14,993 --> 01:02:16,696
Like a date?

1414
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,263
Yeah, if you want to.

1415
01:02:18,297 --> 01:02:19,465
- No, no, yeah, of course.
- I'm not trying

1416
01:02:19,498 --> 01:02:20,232
to pressure you but-

1417
01:02:20,265 --> 01:02:22,501
- Yeah, I can call Katie later.

1418
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:23,569
Okay, yeah.

1419
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:26,405
You ready to?

1420
01:02:27,674 --> 01:02:28,808
Let's get out of here.

1421
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:33,646
Mikey, Michael, by
the time you see this,

1422
01:02:35,013 --> 01:02:36,548
you'll be heading off to
college, or you better be.

1423
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,452
But I'll be proud of
you no matter what.

1424
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:43,489
[Ricky] Cut.

1425
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:44,890
One down, two to go.

1426
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:48,193
You're strong, man.

1427
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:49,863
It must be hard doing
this so many times.

1428
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,263
Yeah, it is.

1429
01:02:51,296 --> 01:02:53,999
But hey, maybe we'll get
lucky and we won't need them.

1430
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:55,869
They say I got some time.

1431
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:56,902
I'm starting chemo.

1432
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:00,339
But I knew that when I saw this,

1433
01:03:00,372 --> 01:03:02,574
that it was a great opportunity

1434
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:05,144
to leave something
beautiful for my family,

1435
01:03:05,177 --> 01:03:07,112
just in case.

1436
01:03:07,946 --> 01:03:09,581
Well, why this park?

1437
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:11,283
I've always been a runner.

1438
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:13,318
It's the only way I can unwind.

1439
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:16,890
I bring the kids with
me on shorter runs,

1440
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:19,558
and we always stop here,
right at this bench.

1441
01:03:20,794 --> 01:03:24,463
We just, you know, talk
and laugh and goof off.

1442
01:03:25,665 --> 01:03:27,867
That's a great reason
to pick this place.

1443
01:03:29,234 --> 01:03:31,937
[Ricky] Ready for another?

1444
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,439
Ready.

1445
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:34,573
[Ricky] Camera's rolling.

1446
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:36,942
I just want you to know

1447
01:03:36,975 --> 01:03:40,379
that you have always amazed
me with your brilliance,

1448
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,948
your ability to solve problems.

1449
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:44,784
You are such a kind soul.

1450
01:03:46,452 --> 01:03:48,153
I did a good job with you.

1451
01:03:48,187 --> 01:03:50,088
Ah, your mom helped a little.

1452
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,928
What I'm saying is I love you.

1453
01:03:56,428 --> 01:03:57,897
And as you graduate,

1454
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:01,166
know that I am with you and
watching over you always.

1455
01:04:02,568 --> 01:04:03,770
So, say your prayers,

1456
01:04:03,803 --> 01:04:05,939
and believe that great
things can happen,

1457
01:04:07,172 --> 01:04:09,141
because they can and they do.

1458
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:14,848
And keep me in your life
by remembering me out loud.

1459
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:18,751
Go with your mom to church.

1460
01:04:18,785 --> 01:04:19,953
Seek comfort in God,

1461
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:23,957
because God and I, we got you.

1462
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:27,526
I love you, kid.

1463
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:29,963
You did good.

1464
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:32,632
[gentle music]

1465
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:50,315
I can't believe how many
people we've helped so far.

1466
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,518
It's a blessing
for us and for them.

1467
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:54,954
I feel like this is
my purpose, you know,

1468
01:04:54,988 --> 01:04:56,088
to help these people.

1469
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:56,956
I don't-
[door knocking]

1470
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,691
[Rebecca] Excuse me.

1471
01:04:58,725 --> 01:05:00,960
[John] Hi, yes,
how many we help you?

1472
01:05:00,994 --> 01:05:02,695
My name's Rebecca Alton.

1473
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:03,963
I got a call from someone

1474
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:05,965
that my mother left
something for me here?

1475
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:07,132
Yes, hi, Rebecca.

1476
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:08,968
Yeah, hi, I'm Lindsey.

1477
01:05:09,002 --> 01:05:10,970
We do have something from you,

1478
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:12,872
actually from your mother.

1479
01:05:14,306 --> 01:05:17,010
My mom passed away a few
weeks ago, so how can you?

1480
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,678
Well, Rebecca, we met
your mother two months ago,

1481
01:05:18,711 --> 01:05:21,014
and she left you a message.

1482
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:22,214
Would you like to watch it now?

1483
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,017
Please, it'll
bring you comfort.

1484
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:25,018
She loves you.

1485
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,620
I'm not sure that I
understand that, but okay.

1486
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:34,861
My darling little girl,

1487
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:38,263
when you watch this,

1488
01:05:38,297 --> 01:05:40,365
I will have moved on
to be with the Lord,

1489
01:05:41,734 --> 01:05:43,870
but I will always be with you

1490
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,438
on the journey
through this life.

1491
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,643
I want you to know, I love you,

1492
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:53,478
I'm so proud of you,

1493
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:56,615
and you will never be alone.
[Rebecca laughing]

1494
01:05:56,649 --> 01:06:00,285
I'm always be with
you in your heart.

1495
01:06:01,486 --> 01:06:02,621
I'm watching over you.

1496
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:06,693
I love you, Mom.

1497
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:08,061
I love you, Rebecca.

1498
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:12,431
[car rumbling]

1499
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,707
[gentle music]

1500
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,121
[Andrew] Excuse me, sir.

1501
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:39,826
What do you want?

1502
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:41,094
I'm sorry to bother you.

1503
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:42,996
I'm from a Living
Legacy of Love.

1504
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:45,197
Your son, Brian, sent me.

1505
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,200
[Brian's Mom] Robert, Robert?

1506
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,303
What's going on here?

1507
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:54,306
This guy, he said
that Brian sent him.

1508
01:06:56,643 --> 01:06:57,644
Why?

1509
01:06:57,677 --> 01:06:58,978
Brian's dead, leave!

1510
01:06:59,012 --> 01:07:00,780
Jake, Jake, please.

1511
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:02,081
Brian sent us for you.

1512
01:07:02,115 --> 01:07:03,148
Why?

1513
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:05,417
He said you needed
a big brother figure.

1514
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,053
He wanted me to teach you.

1515
01:07:07,086 --> 01:07:09,588
I don't need
anything from you.

1516
01:07:09,621 --> 01:07:11,590
Jake, please
just listen to me.

1517
01:07:12,725 --> 01:07:14,292
I understand what
you're going through.

1518
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:15,527
I lost my brother too.

1519
01:07:16,996 --> 01:07:20,099
We just wanna share the message
that Brian left for you.

1520
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:22,167
I can leave this here and go?

1521
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,970
Come on, let's go.

1522
01:07:24,003 --> 01:07:25,004
Come inside.

1523
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:25,838
Let's talk.

1524
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:32,912
[gentle music]

1525
01:07:32,945 --> 01:07:34,113
I don't understand.

1526
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:36,115
What is it that Brian did?

1527
01:07:36,149 --> 01:07:38,383
[Andrew] Here,
this is for you all.

1528
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:39,451
What is this?

1529
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:45,024
It's a message
from your son, Brian.

1530
01:07:45,058 --> 01:07:45,825
What does it say?

1531
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:46,959
I can't say.

1532
01:07:46,993 --> 01:07:48,094
Just, just watch.

1533
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:50,963
Go on.

1534
01:07:50,997 --> 01:07:53,766
Son, it's, go
ahead and hit play.

1535
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,436
Looks like you're heading
over that hill, huh?

1536
01:07:57,469 --> 01:08:00,707
Look, I just, I just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

1537
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:04,209
Mom, give the old man
a hug from me, yeah?

1538
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:11,184
Even though my
time here is short,

1539
01:08:17,056 --> 01:08:21,961
I had a wonderful
life, and support,

1540
01:08:24,764 --> 01:08:27,800
and I want, I want you
to feel the same as well.

1541
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,705
I hope this message
brings you comfort.

1542
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:41,114
Even though I'd much rather
be here in my own body,

1543
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:48,154
I'm always gonna be
watching over you, kid,

1544
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:50,422
because God has a plan.

1545
01:08:52,992 --> 01:08:54,459
So, remember these two things,

1546
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:02,400
keep your faith and I
will always love you.

1547
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:05,437
Thank you for listening.

1548
01:09:06,304 --> 01:09:07,339
Jake, whenever you're ready,

1549
01:09:07,372 --> 01:09:08,540
just give me a call,

1550
01:09:08,573 --> 01:09:10,575
and I'll teach you
how to use that thing.

1551
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:11,744
[Jake] Okay.

1552
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:13,278
[Brian's Mom] Thank you.

1553
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:14,279
Of course.

1554
01:09:14,312 --> 01:09:15,214
[Brian's Mom]
Thank you so much.

1555
01:09:15,248 --> 01:09:16,249
This was so beautiful.

1556
01:09:17,216 --> 01:09:18,684
You're welcome.

1557
01:09:28,828 --> 01:09:31,429
[gentle music]

1558
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,403
[water splashing]

1559
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:03,095
Seriously, don't
push me in again.

1560
01:10:03,129 --> 01:10:04,997
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

1561
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:05,865
You're so bad.

1562
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,902
Oh, yeah, how'd it go
with Brian's family?

1563
01:10:09,936 --> 01:10:11,304
I wish you were there,

1564
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:12,537
but it went pretty well.

1565
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:16,309
The mom seemed to be really
moved by the message.

1566
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:19,212
You can, you can tell the
family's still hurt by it all.

1567
01:10:20,478 --> 01:10:22,849
But I think seeing Brian's
message brought them some hope.

1568
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:24,317
So glad we're
doing this together.

1569
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:25,218
It just feels right.

1570
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:26,518
It does.

1571
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:27,854
Yeah, me too, me too.

1572
01:10:29,387 --> 01:10:30,690
Hey, I'll give you
two seconds to swim.

1573
01:10:30,723 --> 01:10:33,358
[Andrew laughs]

1574
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:44,469
[Josh] Dad, it's 24!

1575
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:45,338
I knew you'd get it.

1576
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,272
Very good.

1577
01:10:46,305 --> 01:10:47,472
[phone ringing]

1578
01:10:47,505 --> 01:10:48,741
What else do we have here?

1579
01:10:48,774 --> 01:10:50,575
Hello, this is Lindsey.

1580
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:52,011
[Man] Hi, Lindsey.

1581
01:10:52,044 --> 01:10:53,212
We'd like to send
our news reporter,

1582
01:10:53,246 --> 01:10:54,213
to interview you

1583
01:10:54,247 --> 01:10:56,048
about a Legacy of Love.

1584
01:10:56,082 --> 01:10:57,415
Yes, yes, when?

1585
01:10:58,751 --> 01:11:00,720
[Man] How about
Monday at 6 p.m.?

1586
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:03,789
Okay, I'll be
there, Monday at six.

1587
01:11:03,823 --> 01:11:04,891
Thank you so much.

1588
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:08,327
Dad, Dad, I need to
tell you something!

1589
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:10,997
[gentle music]

1590
01:11:16,434 --> 01:11:18,838
This message
really hit me hard.

1591
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:20,072
So much heart.

1592
01:11:21,473 --> 01:11:24,076
Dean really did love his wife.

1593
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:24,911
I know.

1594
01:11:27,346 --> 01:11:30,415
I'm glad he called
us to record him.

1595
01:11:30,448 --> 01:11:33,352
It doesn't get easier,
doing what we're doing,

1596
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:34,820
making these videos,

1597
01:11:34,854 --> 01:11:38,391
but there's a genuine
comfort in knowing

1598
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:40,693
that even a little bit
of their loved ones

1599
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:41,593
are gonna come back to them

1600
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:43,495
through what we're doing.

1601
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:44,830
It's something for them

1602
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:46,399
that will live on
through generations.

1603
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,734
A living legacy of love.

1604
01:11:48,768 --> 01:11:50,036
[phone ringing]

1605
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:51,603
So, that's where
the name comes from.

1606
01:11:51,637 --> 01:11:52,939
It all makes sense now.

1607
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:00,512
Living Legacy of Love.

1608
01:12:00,545 --> 01:12:01,479
How can I help you?

1609
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,885
Okay, yeah, we can come to you,

1610
01:12:05,918 --> 01:12:07,286
or you can come to us.

1611
01:12:09,322 --> 01:12:10,588
Okay, perfect.

1612
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:11,757
What's the address?

1613
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,630
Okay, Wednesday at six.

1614
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,466
We'll be there.

1615
01:12:21,499 --> 01:12:22,500
Thank you.

1616
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:28,140
Hey, you know what'd be nice?

1617
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:31,344
If we invited everyone
we gave the videos to,

1618
01:12:31,377 --> 01:12:32,577
to come to group.

1619
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,715
[Andrew] We could do that.

1620
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:36,916
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1621
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:38,417
We can prepare a
special invitation,

1622
01:12:38,451 --> 01:12:40,686
and bring it with the
messages when we deliver them.

1623
01:12:42,655 --> 01:12:43,555
I love it.

1624
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:49,362
Here they come, let's go.

1625
01:12:50,196 --> 01:12:51,430
Fantastic, okay we'll do that.

1626
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:53,132
Yeah.

1627
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:54,566
[Interviewer] Are you the
Living Legacy of Love group?

1628
01:12:54,599 --> 01:12:56,168
Yeah.

1629
01:12:56,202 --> 01:12:59,205
Lindsey, the Living Legacy
of Love was your brain child.

1630
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:01,474
Now, that you've helped
over a hundred people,

1631
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:02,475
how do you feel?

1632
01:13:03,376 --> 01:13:05,111
Well, I'm at peace with it,

1633
01:13:05,144 --> 01:13:07,780
but there are hundreds
more and it will never end.

1634
01:13:07,813 --> 01:13:10,349
As long as we can keep bringing
love and peace to people,

1635
01:13:10,383 --> 01:13:13,686
then the Living Legacy of
Love will have a place.

1636
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:15,121
It's never ending.

1637
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:16,588
That's beautiful.

1638
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:20,525
Lindsey, how was the name
Living Legacy of Love chosen?

1639
01:13:20,558 --> 01:13:22,495
Was there something
that inspired you?

1640
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:23,496
Yeah.

1641
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:24,830
Well, our loved ones are alive

1642
01:13:24,864 --> 01:13:26,265
when they record their message.

1643
01:13:26,298 --> 01:13:28,300
And their message
is a gift of love,

1644
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:30,503
and it's a legacy
they leave for us.

1645
01:13:31,504 --> 01:13:32,905
I mean, it's priceless,

1646
01:13:32,938 --> 01:13:35,875
worth more than any material
thing could ever be.

1647
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:37,777
It can be shared with the
loved ones left behind,

1648
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,079
and even with future
family members.

1649
01:13:40,112 --> 01:13:41,981
It's a living legacy of love,

1650
01:13:42,014 --> 01:13:44,517
as it brings them back to us,

1651
01:13:44,549 --> 01:13:46,519
even if it's just for a
few moments at a time.

1652
01:13:46,584 --> 01:13:48,854
Yeah, the name just felt right.

1653
01:13:48,888 --> 01:13:49,889
I can see that.

1654
01:13:49,922 --> 01:13:51,290
It's so powerful to know

1655
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:53,292
that when someone's
hurting so much,

1656
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:55,294
that they can be touched
by a loved one's message.

1657
01:13:55,327 --> 01:13:58,531
What would you want us to take
away from your experiences

1658
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:00,733
and path of giving that?

1659
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:02,535
When my mom died,
I was so lost.

1660
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:05,638
I didn't think my life
could have a purpose,

1661
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:08,507
or a direction
without her in it.

1662
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,010
But slowly I realized that
we all have a purpose,

1663
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:13,012
and we're never alone.

1664
01:14:13,045 --> 01:14:14,747
God is with us always.

1665
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,549
Our loved ones are
always with us.

1666
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:18,084
And I really want people to know

1667
01:14:18,117 --> 01:14:20,753
that even though their
loved one has crossed over,

1668
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:22,755
they're always with you,

1669
01:14:22,788 --> 01:14:24,356
and that love never dies.

1670
01:14:25,558 --> 01:14:27,259
I think she said
it perfectly, folks.

1671
01:14:27,293 --> 01:14:30,062
If you'd like to learn more

[gentle music]

1674
01:14:36,102 --> 01:14:37,870
Alright, thank you so much.

1675
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,219
Dad?

1676
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:54,019
Yeah.

1677
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:56,522
Don't you think
Grandpa's dementia

1678
01:14:56,555 --> 01:14:58,791
is getting kind of bad?

1679
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:00,459
I mean...

1680
01:15:00,493 --> 01:15:03,529
Yeah, look, you know how
Grandma's in the hospital

1681
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:04,363
for hip surgery,

1682
01:15:06,398 --> 01:15:11,403
well when she's not around, his
memory begins to fade and...

1683
01:15:11,937 --> 01:15:13,572
Yeah.

1684
01:15:13,606 --> 01:15:16,609
I don't know, maybe we
could play a video of her,

1685
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:18,644
see if he remembers?

1686
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:19,612
Yeah, do you have one?

1687
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:20,913
Yeah, I have multiple.

1688
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:23,415
[Daniel laughs]
We could play that one?

1689
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:25,151
That was a good day.

1690
01:15:25,184 --> 01:15:26,352
Give it a shot.

1691
01:15:26,385 --> 01:15:27,153
Right.

1692
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:28,420
Hey, Grandpa.

1693
01:15:28,454 --> 01:15:29,221
Hey, Pop.

1694
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:30,055
Hey, we-

1695
01:15:30,089 --> 01:15:30,956
- Pop, Pop.

1696
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,925
We have a video of Grandma.

1697
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,193
[Josh] Oh, let me see.

1698
01:15:35,394 --> 01:15:36,162
You remember Grandma?

1699
01:15:36,195 --> 01:15:37,096
Grandma?

1700
01:15:37,129 --> 01:15:38,097
[Grandma] Okay, open it.

1701
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,265
Where is she?

1702
01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:40,599
- Are you ready?
- She's in the hospital.

1703
01:15:40,634 --> 01:15:42,601
She's in the hospital
for her hip surgery.

1704
01:15:42,636 --> 01:15:45,604
[Grandma speaking faintly]

1705
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:48,274
Hey, look, it's her.

1706
01:15:48,307 --> 01:15:49,441
- Really?
- Really.

1707
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:51,744
Really?
[family laughing]

1708
01:15:51,777 --> 01:15:54,648
You know I love
wine and chocolate.

1709
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,615
She is so beautiful.

1710
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,616
I miss her.

1711
01:15:58,617 --> 01:16:00,686
She's, look at her.

1712
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:01,954
Oh, well, what a beautiful,

1713
01:16:01,987 --> 01:16:03,522
her smile just radiates.

1714
01:16:03,556 --> 01:16:05,191
- Aw.
- I love her, oh.

1715
01:16:05,224 --> 01:16:06,325
Oh, look at that.

1716
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:07,627
Oh my goodness, that's...

1717
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:09,962
[Daniel] [laughs]
Yeah, that's the best.

1718
01:16:09,995 --> 01:16:11,030
You used to give
a fig, Grandpa.

1719
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:11,964
[Jack] Oh my goodness.

1720
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:14,033
I do love it.

1721
01:16:14,066 --> 01:16:16,735
We could be twinsies [laughs]

1722
01:16:16,769 --> 01:16:19,538
[gentle music]

1723
01:16:21,473 --> 01:16:22,875
Cookies, again?

1724
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:24,476
Yeah!

1725
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:26,612
You know I wouldn't
mind being with you.

1726
01:16:27,613 --> 01:16:28,614
I gotta go though.

1727
01:16:28,648 --> 01:16:30,482
My dad says we have to be home.

1728
01:16:30,516 --> 01:16:32,851
Linds, before we go,

1729
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:34,887
could I talk to you
about something?

1730
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,622
Yeah, of course,
babe, what's up?

1731
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:40,192
I brought you something.

1732
01:16:40,226 --> 01:16:42,662
It's little, but it
means a lot to me.

1733
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,066
Linds, you mean the world to me.

1734
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:49,301
Since we met at the church,

1735
01:16:49,335 --> 01:16:52,238
you fully restored
faith in my life.

1736
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:53,707
And not only in my life,

1737
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:56,676
but we've helped so many
people restore their hope

1738
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:58,110
and their love.

1739
01:16:59,578 --> 01:17:02,314
Most importantly, we
brought love back to them.

1740
01:17:02,348 --> 01:17:03,549
[air whooshing]

1741
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,686
Mom, how do you know
when it's true love?

1742
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,188
Well, you just know,

1743
01:17:09,221 --> 01:17:10,724
like your dad and I.

1744
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:13,727
The right person will represent
hope and faith and love.

1745
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:16,730
I wouldn't worry about that.

1746
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:21,333
You look so beautiful.
[air whooshing]

1747
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:22,835
I don't know what to say.

1748
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:26,238
Linds, when you
wear this necklace,

1749
01:17:27,707 --> 01:17:29,775
I want you to be
reminded of three things.

1750
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:32,778
The cross represents faith,

1751
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:36,782
the anchor represents hope,

1752
01:17:38,584 --> 01:17:39,952
and the heart represents love,

1753
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,689
which is everything
you are to me.

1754
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,043
It's beautiful, Andrew.

1755
01:18:04,076 --> 01:18:05,210
You look great in it.

1756
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:11,984
[Lindsey] Thank
you, I love it.

1757
01:18:12,017 --> 01:18:14,186
[Andrew] You're welcome.

1758
01:18:35,809 --> 01:18:36,909
[gentle music]

1759
01:18:36,942 --> 01:18:38,745
[Lindsey] I
would give anything

1760
01:18:38,778 --> 01:18:40,346
to have my mom here with me.

1761
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:48,520
For a long time, I was
angry with my own pain.

1762
01:18:49,555 --> 01:18:52,591
Sometimes people grieving, well,

1763
01:18:52,624 --> 01:18:54,193
we get caught up
in our own pain,

1764
01:18:57,896 --> 01:18:59,865
so much so, we can't see

1765
01:18:59,898 --> 01:19:02,935
how serving others
in pain would help,

1766
01:19:02,968 --> 01:19:05,070
or why we should even do it.

1767
01:19:06,338 --> 01:19:10,744
I was just so angry
with life, with God,

1768
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:15,581
but I grew in my faith.

1769
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:23,489
I realized that helping
people also helped me heal.

1770
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:29,194
For me, being able to help
people heal and have faith

1771
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:32,564
has been the greatest
gift from God.

1772
01:19:40,038 --> 01:19:42,809
I know that a Living
Legacy of Love

1773
01:19:42,842 --> 01:19:44,910
has brought hope
to so many people,

1774
01:19:45,879 --> 01:19:47,379
and it will for years to come.

1775
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:50,048
Never feel alone.

1776
01:19:51,183 --> 01:19:54,953
Know that God is
always with you.

1777
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:29,047
[gentle music]

1778
01:21:51,503 --> 01:21:52,371
Hey, Mom.

1779
01:21:56,743 --> 01:21:59,311
First off, I wanna say thank you

1780
01:21:59,344 --> 01:22:02,682
for finally sharing that
secret lasagna recipe with me.

1781
01:22:03,883 --> 01:22:06,886
You made Tony and
my boys so happy.

1782
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:10,422
Maybe you could make
it for them too.

1783
01:22:13,693 --> 01:22:15,060
I also, I just,

1784
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:18,564
I wanna say that, that
being your daughter,

1785
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:21,533
has been such an honor.

1786
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,070
You've always been my hero.

1787
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:28,440
I hope I've made you proud.

1788
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:35,715
I'm gonna miss your hugs.

1789
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:37,717
I'm gonna miss your hugs

1790
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:40,552
and your weird mom jokes.

1791
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:44,489
Please tell them to my boys.

1792
01:22:44,523 --> 01:22:46,759
Help them remember who I am.

1793
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:48,928
And remember that
they're your family too.

1794
01:22:52,197 --> 01:22:57,070
Don't be sad and don't be alone.

1795
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:00,439
I love you, Mom.

1796
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:03,542
I love you.

1797
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:09,716
Carla, this message means
that I'm watching over you.

1798
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:13,886
Please don't be sad.

1799
01:23:15,554 --> 01:23:17,957
We had 20 beautiful years,

1800
01:23:18,925 --> 01:23:20,760
and three beautiful children.

1801
01:23:23,428 --> 01:23:28,433
I want you to laugh, feel joy,
and tell stories about me,

1802
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:32,571
so that our children
and our grandchildren

1803
01:23:32,604 --> 01:23:35,173
would know how much I
love you and our family.

1804
01:23:38,845 --> 01:23:41,748
Until we meet again, I
love you, my sweet wife.

1805
01:23:44,616 --> 01:23:47,352
Thank you for so
many wonderful years.

1806
01:23:51,991 --> 01:23:55,862
Oh, honey, I know
you're hurting without me.

1807
01:23:55,895 --> 01:23:57,897
That's why I wanted to
try to do this, a tape,

1808
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,032
while I still could.

1809
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:03,803
I can't thank you enough

1810
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:06,739
for being there for
me all these years,

1811
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:09,142
and facing the big C with me.

1812
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:10,143
[gentle music]

1813
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:11,443
I know it wasn't easy.

1814
01:24:14,246 --> 01:24:15,180
How could it be?

1815
01:24:16,983 --> 01:24:21,688
I wasn't always myself
and I'm sorry for that.

1816
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:24,691
It just wasn't fair.

1817
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:28,695
But I want you to know

1818
01:24:28,728 --> 01:24:31,798
that you weren't just
the love of my life,

1819
01:24:31,831 --> 01:24:33,298
you were my life,

1820
01:24:33,331 --> 01:24:37,369
and you brought so much joy
and laughter into this family.

1821
01:24:37,402 --> 01:24:41,007
But now it's time for
you to live, baby,

1822
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,110
and share that big, beautiful
light inside of yours,

1823
01:24:44,143 --> 01:24:45,144
with the world.

1824
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:51,017
Hey, Megs, I know everyone
says this in the movies,

1825
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:53,452
but if you are watching this,

1826
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:57,522
I have left this world.

1827
01:25:02,427 --> 01:25:04,362
I wanted to leave you something

1828
01:25:05,765 --> 01:25:10,402
that not only would inspire
you, but comfort you.

1829
01:25:11,838 --> 01:25:13,305
And even though I'm not in
this world with you physically,

1830
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,777
I will always be with you here.

1831
01:25:23,116 --> 01:25:23,916
No tears.

1832
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:35,661
You have to keep
your chin up, okay?

1833
01:25:35,695 --> 01:25:37,797
You have to be strong
for Scotty, alright?

1834
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:46,873
Promise me you'll fill
yours and Scotty's life

1835
01:25:46,906 --> 01:25:49,742
with as much love as
this world can give you.

1836
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:01,453
In this life, the afterlife,

1837
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:02,922
and in the lives to follow,

1838
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:08,293
together forever.

1839
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:14,399
Until we are together again,

1840
01:26:18,503 --> 01:26:20,239
I love you so much.
