00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,333
and how to get it fast.

553
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,035
My brother's stuck in the streets.

554
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,803
I just found out my best friend

555
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,738
is stuck with a fuckin' pimp.

556
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,408
And I'm really the only one that can save them for real.

557
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,542
- Damn, that sounds tough.

558
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,145
- Man, tell me about it.

559
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,215
- Look, maybe God put you in my car for a reason.

560
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,051
- (laughs) Why you say that?

561
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,552
- It actually turns out that I'm

562
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,287
looking for a new business partner.

563
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,424
Somebody to help me with this new venture of mine.

564
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,692
- [Princess] Is that right?

565
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,894
- Yeah, look, we did a test run last week

566
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,430
and we made a million dollars, easy.

567
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,831
- A million dollars?

568
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,399
- A million dollars. (laughs)

569
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,834
- That's it?

570
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,303
(quietly) Get the fuck out of here.

571
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,005
- Oh, so I see what this is.

572
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,642
You think I'm trying to run some type of con on you, huh?

573
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,110
- Look, Mr.-

574
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,211
- Omar.

575
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,513
- Omar. I'm from the hood.

576
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,248
My brother is the biggest salesman I know.

577
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,749
I know when game being ran on me

578
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,818
so you can keep your little million dollar in a month

579
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,685
business venture.

580
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,753
I'm straight.

581
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,557
- You know what?

582
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,059
I see why you so miserable.

583
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,561
- Excuse me?

584
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,430
- You get in my car like your whole world's about to end.

585
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,199
And then I try to give you an opportunity

586
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,401
and you're so close-minded,

587
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,836
you can't see it right in front of your face.

588
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,670
- Close-minded?

589
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,938
- Yeah, close-minded.

590
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,239
- Look, do you get this upset when other people

591
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,741
turn you down too?

592
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:37,976
- Oh, okay.

593
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,178
- Yeah.

594
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,779
- Yeah, okay. I see you, ma'am.

595
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,647
You know what?

596
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,548
- Princess.

597
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,116
- Princess? - Yes.

598
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,785
- All I wanted to do was just give you an opportunity.

599
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,321
Show you a way you can make some extra money.

600
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,255
That's all.

601
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,623
I made a million dollars.

602
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,458
Not saying you gonna do that.

603
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,860
But you know,

604
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,029
since you can't take 10 minutes out your busy schedule,

605
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,497
I'm gonna take you home.

606
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,967
And I'm gonna let you continue to figure it out.

607
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,204
(sad music)

608
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,577
- You smooth.

609
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,011
I give you that.

610
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,112
Fuck it.

611
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,248
I don't have shit else to lose.

612
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,450
But I do have a question though.

613
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,384
- What's that?

614
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,287
- Why you do this driving shit?

615
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:25,390
- I continue to meet people like you.

616
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,329
(upbeat music)

617
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,342
- [Princess] What type of freaky shit is this?

618
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,343
- [Omar] Trust me.

619
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,143
Come on.

620
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,802

621
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,178
Now look.

622
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,681

623
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,949

624
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,783

625
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,418

00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,191

00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,129
- I thought we were done recruiting.

670
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,665
- Yeah, but you know we need some people for L.A.

671

672
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,103

- Honestly?

712
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,442
Sometimes.

713
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,878
But then I see the reward

714
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,780
and I understand it's all a part of the crime.

715
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,683
- You think about it all the time?

716
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,784
- If you work for it,

717
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,353
yeah, but this shit ain't easy.

718
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,524
It's gonna take discipline,

719
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,792
complete focus.

720
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,796
Have you ever even had an encounter with Five-O?

721
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,998
- Who you think you talking to?

00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,967
Privileged Princess?

723
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,036
Shit, Five-O might as well have had an overnight bag

724
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,039
as much as he was at my house.

725
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,740
I ain't scared of Five-O.

726
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,677
- It ain't about being scared of 'em.

727
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,645
It's about out-thinking them,

728
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,681
thinking before them.

729
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,016
Again, this shit ain't easy.

730
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,788
Look, if you expect to be successful in this business,

731
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,357
you need to be a student first.

732
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,860
Remember,

733
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,329
never try to outshine the master.

734
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,707
Look, I may talk my shit,

735
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,409
but I'm just here to help you, okay?

736
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,878
- Okay.

737
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,579
- All right.

738
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,581
Now let's get these bags in here.

739
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,582
- All right.

740
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,755
(plastic snapping)

741
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,758
(suspenseful music)

742
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,334
(doors slamming)

743
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,738
(plastic rustling)

744
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,507
(doors slamming)

745
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,950
(door creaks)

746
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,422
(door closes)

747
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,857
- Damn, another hotel?

748
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,026
- No, that one was for counting money and distribution.

749
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,061
This one's for production.

750
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,863
Grab me one of those bags over there

751
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,632
and I'll show you how to do this.

752
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,671
(plastic rustling)

753
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,613
All right.

754
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,081
You see how some of these is still somewhat put together?

755
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,215
- [Princess] Yeah.

756
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,785
- Hand me that tape over there.

757
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,188
- Here.

758
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,559
(tape creaking)

759
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,996
- You gotta make sure the information matches.

760
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,231
(tape creaking)

761
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,066
- Okay.

762
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,071
So what's all this for?

763
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,108
- Tell me what you see.

764
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,544
- (whispers)

765
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,146
Oh shit!

766
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,615
This is someone's whole life right here.

767
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,117
- Exactly.

768
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,418
It's called data.

769
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,620
Omar preaches data.

770
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,458
So this among all the rest is how we get rich.

771
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,161
(door squeaks)

772
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,296
- Okay.

773
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,332
I see you ladies getting acquainted, huh?

774
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,333
Uh, Diamond?

775
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,337
Where the fuck is Sapphire?

776
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,605
- [Diamond] She said she had to take care of something.

777
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,606
She'll be back.

778
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,440
- Uh hm.

779
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,310
I guess.

780
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,911
So, let me guess.

781
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,113
Data is key.

782
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,714
- I'm still trippin' off this paper.

783
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,749
And then there's more?

784
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,983
- Much more.

785
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,020
That's only a part of the business but,

786
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,922
it's the most key component of what we got goin' on here.

787
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,824
This information that we collect,

788
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,725
if it's local,

789
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,960
we go to the bank,

790
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,628
we get cold, hard cash.

791
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,963
But if it's out of town,

792
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,865
we create one of these.

793
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,038
Courtesy of my man, Jason.

794
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,172
- So all you goin' do is swipe?

795
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,673
- Only swipe.

796
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,543
But, we sell that information too.

797
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,444
- Many people buy?

798
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,945
- Shit, are they?

799
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,815
They buyin' like crackheads at the first of the month.

800
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,385
Now this is where the money really lie.

801
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,720
Formula.

802
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,788
(laughs)

803
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,122
- Wait, I don't get it.

804
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,424
What we scientists now?

805
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,491
- Algorithms.

806
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,692
- Algo-who?

807
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,728
- A series of encrypted codes that redirects

808
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,565
corporate payrolls to those credit cards.

809
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,499
- Oh shit.

810
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,934
Omar, you a bad motherfucker.

811
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,371
- [Diamond] I've been telling him that for years.

812
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,639
- Now Princess,

813
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,743
you ready for your life to be changed?

814
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,677

815
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,411

00:53:58,001 --> 00:53:59,436
like I usually do.

1463
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,737
And I come back

1464
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,539
and this motherfucker in my office.

1465
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,907
I asked him why.

1466
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,874
He tell me,

1467
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:05,709
Omar sent him.

1468
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,510
(punching)

1469
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,245
- So the motherfucker still alive, huh?

1470
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,147
- According to this thieving motherfucker.

1471
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,451
- Hey, why did Omar have you come here?

1472
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,286
- (spits)

1473
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,388
- You fucking spit on my?

1474
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,223
- Listen here, motherfucker

1475
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,691
and you listen real good

1476
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,326
or I decorate this place with your brains, you feel me?

1477
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,695
Omar doesn't give a fuck about you.

1478
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,397
I mean, why else do you think he had you come here,

1479
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,932
knowing that you might get caught.

1480
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,301
But he promised you something in return, hm?

1481
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,503
Money, freedom, drugs.

1482
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,704
Whatever it was,

1483
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,939
he wasn't gonna fulfill on his end.

1484
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,974
What you think he doin' right now, hm?

1485
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,676
Not giving a fuck.

1486
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:40,877
But you know what?

1487
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:41,811
I see you don't give a fuck either.

1488
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,113
Larue, cut this nigga head off.

1489
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,581
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1490
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,415
I'm a tell you, I'm a tell you.

1491
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,249
- What was that?

1492
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,250
- I said I'm a tell you.

1493
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,551
- Nah, you goin' show me.

1494
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,552
- Okay, okay.

1495
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:50,420
(phone buzzes)

1496
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,789
I'm gonna show you.

1497
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,658
- What's the word?

1498
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,360
Yeah, meeting's at 3:00pm.

1499
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,095
All right, I'll see you later.

1500
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,898
Larue, go with this nigga to where he say Omar is at.

1501
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,034
Hey, if you tryin' to fuck with me,

1502
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,602
I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

1503
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,437
Call me if you see it.

1504
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,006
- Goodbye, Princess.

1505
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:10,840
- Bye!

1506
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,409
See y'all at three.

1507
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,853
- Alright. Alright.

1508
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,524
You see that one right there.

1509
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,359
That's where I met him.

1510
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,593
- I mean now tell me shit.

1511
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,529
How do I know that ain't somebody else's room?

1512
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:33,630
- I said I'll show you where he is,

1513
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,198
not give you proof.

1514
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:36,700
- Motherfucker, well you better figure out something

1515
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,735
if you wanna live.

1516
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,669
- Look.

1517
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,937
Ain't that him?

1518
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,208
- I told you.

1519
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,042
- Shut up.

1520
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,878
- I might be damned.

1521
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,017
(suspenseful music)

1522
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,921
I can't believe I'm saying this but,

1523
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,156
I got a visual on your boy.

1524
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,524
What you want us to do?

1525
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,359
You want us to move in?

1526
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,828
- [Princess] Nah, not yet.

1527
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:05,762
I got a plan.

1528
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,297
You ready for the meeting?

1529
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,399
- Bet, say less.

1530
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:12,902
What you want us to do with our other boy over here?

1531
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,871
- [Princess] Get rid of him.

1532
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,772
- Say less.

1533
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,310
(suspenseful music)

1534
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,287
(guns blasting)

1535
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,966
(door closing)

1536
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,535
- All right, fellas, listen up.

1537
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,073
Intel is telling us that these folks are all connected.

1538
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,808
It's y'alls job to tell me how.

1539
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,677
I want to know how this gas station clerk

1540
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,113
goes from zero to hero.

1541
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,414
What happened to her brother?

1542
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,516
Where are they working?

1543
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,050
What's their next move?

1544
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,719
- You mean to tell me that that woman

1545
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,622
stole millions of dollars from top corporations in America

1546
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,490
and no one even noticed?

1547
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,758
- Right underneath their goddamned nose.

1548
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,260
Families have lost their businesses,

1549
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,594
homes, property.

1550
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,464
- She deserves everything coming for her.

1551
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,999
- You bet.

1552
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,601
- So we think this mystery man is the one who's helping her?

1553
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,869
- We can only assume.

1554
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,438
We may have a lead from this previous operation,

1555
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,873
but it's an old one.

1556
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:24,774
- Yeah, but people like that,

1557
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,109
they always keep moving.

1558
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,644
They never sit still.

1559
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,547
- Well, all moving things come to a stop eventually.

1560
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,548
- Says no physicist ever.

1561
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,782
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1562
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,350
- I mean an object in motion stays in motion.

1563
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,318
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1564
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,486
- I'm just saying.

1565
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,687
- Hey, we gotta get on this now.

1566
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,521
- Listen, listen,

1567
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:39,355
listen, gentlemen.

1568
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:40,190
- I'm just saying.

1569
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,424
- Listen.

1570
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,892
I want you to run this lead with Reed.

1571
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,228
I also want you to run a face recognition on this man,

1572
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,930
using the Lexus database.

1573
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,498
Reed.

1574
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,999
I need to see you.

1575
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:51,868
- Okay.

1576
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,176
Man, you fucked to see me.

1577
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,144
- Good luck.

1578
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,853
- Hey, hey, what the fuck was that?

1579
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:10,687
- My bad, man.

1580
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,088
I mean, you know,

1581
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:15,358
dealin' with a lot of personal shit, man at the crib.

1582
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:16,292
- [Chief] All right.

1583
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,560
But more importantly, man,

1584
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,329
I'm really pissed off that this is happening

1585
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,497
right underneath our noses, man.

1586
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:22,665
We gotta get on the bottom of this.

1587
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,499
- Yeah, I got it.

1588
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:24,334
But hey listen.

1589
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,168
Simpson's new, man.

1590
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,503
I can't have that shit.

1591
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:29,239
Are you cool? Are we good?

1592
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,373
Let's get this.

1593
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,741
Let's get these son-of-a-bitches, okay?

1594
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:32,575
- All right. You got it.

1595
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,509
My bad.

1596
00:58:33,509 --> 00:58:34,744
- Hey, I trust in you, man.

1597
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:35,645
You're gonna take my spot, all right?

1598
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,479

01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,372
- And there's more where that came from.

1642
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,207
All I ask for is your loyalty.

1643
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,210
- You keep these payments rollin' in and you got it.

1644
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,913
- I need you to understand that it's more than that.

1645
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,082
The payments roll in based off your performance,

1646
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,450
your value to me.

1647
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,085
Do you understand?

1648
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,353
If I wanted a pro bono lawyer

1649
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,021

1650
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,789

01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:35,031

Can you do that?

your presence is appreciated.

1759
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,742
In the last six months,

1760
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,212
we have established a solid network

1761
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,848
allowing us to redirect payroll

1762
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:42,785

1763
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,387
Recently,

1764
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,856
an offer has been made for us to

1765
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,692

1766
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,794

1767
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,997
Among the other streams of income,

1768
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,166
these two are our biggest.

1769
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:01,604

Maria here is our international business affair officer.

1772
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,380

1780
01:04:36,872 --> 01:04:40,076

1781
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:43,613

1782
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,148

01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,060

1789
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,562

Finally, Bug, our tech guy.

1791
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,001
Without him,

1792
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,168
there's no us.

1793
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:10,606
Now my goal is to provide generational wealth.

1794
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,375
You stay loyal to me,

1795
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,778
your kids' kids shouldn't want for nothing.

1796
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:19,382
I'm going to be the biggest female hustler

1797
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,550
in the history of mankind.

1798
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:24,920
But, there's one threat.

1799
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,223
His name is Omar.

1800
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:29,725
- Princess.

1801
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:35,231
- Word is she built a new team.

1802
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,599
- But she's not even using the same algorhythm

1803
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,933
Jason created.

1804
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:39,268
- Her tech is so advanced.

1805
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,304
I can't even crack the mainframe.

1806
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,706
- Omar, what are we gonna do?

1807
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,242
- We move on to plan B.

1808
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,311
- What was plan A?

1809
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,079
- One that didn't end well.

1810
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,580
So now we switch it up,

1811
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,416
we get in her mind,

1812
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:57,286
make it, make it seem like I'm giving in,

1813
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,255
make it seem like I want to partner with her.

1814
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:00,289
- What are we at Diamond?

1815
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,524
- What?

1816
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,459
- Princess trusted you the most, right?

1817
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,727
- I mean, I guess.

1818
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:05,995
But shit, don't none of that matter now.

1819
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,530
She don't trust none of us.

1820
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:11,834
- But, if we make it seem like I turned on you too,

1821
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,036
she wouldn't know what to expect.

1822
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,271
Yeah, T that's what I'm gonna do.

1823
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,740
I'm gonna have you go over to her,

1824
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,710
act like you wanna join forces with her

1825
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,578
for revenge towards me.

1826
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:25,715
Then, we'll have an inside man.

1827
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:26,982
- I don't know, Omar.

1828
01:06:26,982 --> 01:06:27,917
That doesn't seem like a good idea.

1829
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,785
- What's up with you, huh?

1830
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,987
Don't you want all us to win?

1831
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:33,155
- Of course I do.

1832
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,790
- You can't.

1833
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,058
You always talking about,

1834
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,426
"I don't know, Omar,"

1835
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,462
or, "Maybe it don't seem right, Omar,"

1836
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,098
or "It may not work, Omar."

1837
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,366
Why can't you just be like,

1838
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,767
"Let's go, Omar!"

1839
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,769
or "Let's do it, Omar.

1840
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,604
It's great idea, Omar."

1841
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,939
You know what? Just sit there.

1842
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,173
Don't say shit.

1843
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,908
Have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up.

1844
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:53,743
All right?

1845
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,912
If you don't got any bright ideas to bring to the table,

1846
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,848
I don't wanna hear nothing.

1847
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,149
What?

1848
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:03,252
What y'all scared of Princess now?

1849
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,054
Y'all gonna act like some bitches?

1850
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,889
That bitch shot at me.

1851
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,728
I ain't going out like that.

1852
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:17,066
This is the time that we unite.

1853
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:18,968
Diamond,

1854
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,005
I need you in this.

1855
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,041
- Okay, Omar.

1856
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:26,876
I got you.

1857
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,412
- What do you want me to do?

1858
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:30,346
- You and Ace,

1859
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,747
y'all go to Daeton.

1860
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,249
Check out that new formula.

1861
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,917
Jason's goin' to test it while you're all down there, okay?

1862
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,118
Jason,

1863
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:37,553
we need to get as much cash as possible,

1864
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,155
if you're going to ride with me, okay?

1865
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:39,989
- Okay.

1866
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,959
- The mission here is to end whatever Princess thing

1867
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,795
she got going on

1868
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,862
by any means.

1869
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,999
- By any means,

1870
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:53,169
we cannot let Omar get the upper hand.

1871
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,005
Fam and Doe,

1872
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:58,607
I need y'all to go back to the motel

1873
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,075
and track his every move.

1874
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:02,445
- Anything for you, Princess.

1875
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,147
- Maria,

1876
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,348
your flight leaves in a few hours.

1877
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,484
Is there anything else you need from me?

1878
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,653
- Not that I can think of.

1879
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:11,887
Oh, do you have that phone?

1880
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:12,721
- Oh yeah.

1881
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:17,493
- Untraceable, right?

1882
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,561
- Yes.

1883
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,495
- Okay.

1884
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,664
I'll call you when I land.

1885
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:29,605
- (speaking in foreign language)

1886
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,474
- Rebecca,

1887
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:32,975
I'm going to send Bug with you

1888
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,877
to give you a little bit more insight on what we're doing

1889
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,445
digitally so that you have a better understanding.

1890
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:37,379
Okay? - Okay.

1891
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,582
Come on, Bug.

1892
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,593
- Call me when you get the email, okay?

1893
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:51,427
- Okay.

1894
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,002
- All right, look.

1895
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:02,304
Omar is a tricky motherfucker.

1896
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,873
I don't need y'all getting caught up in his war.

1897
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,608
It's already bad enough we lost Dae Dae.

1898
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,743
- It's because of Dae Dae we wanna ride for you, Princess.

1899
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:08,978
- I know that.

1900
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:09,778
That's why I need y'all to distribute

1901
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,113
this income and product.

1902
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,516
I need brains now more than ever.

1903
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,417
Y'all know how the streets move when it come to rock.

1904
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,652
- You're not going to have to worry about that.

1905
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,721
- [Doe] Yeah, we got that shit locked.

1906
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,322
- Even the white boys in upper Arlington?

1907
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,857
- Shit, they ain't fucking with us.

1908
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,660
- Plus we took the clientele last year.

1909
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,128
- It's a new year, Black.

1910
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,097
Every day is a new year when it comes to this life.

1911
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,099
The next hour isn't promised for any of us.

1912
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,367
That's why I need you to set up the meeting

1913
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,568
with the Arlington boys.

1914
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,537
Bring them into what we got going on.

1915
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:36,405
- With all due respect Sis,

1916
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,907
this shit ain't going to never work.

1917
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,142
They ain't nothin' but stuck up, rich-ass white folks.

1918
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,010
- Shit.

1919
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,478
Good thing I'm rich too.

1920
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,413
All I see is green.

1921
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:45,648
Set up the meeting, Black.

1922
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,683
Let's do this in the name of Dae Dae.

1923
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,118
- Okay. - Okay.

1924
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,553
- Okay, let's go.

1925
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,659
- You set up that meeting now but,

1926
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,327
we still want you there just in case.

1927
01:09:58,327 --> 01:09:59,261
- [Princess] All right.

1928
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:00,162
Let me know the time and place.

1929
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,330
- I will soon.

1930
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,676
- That didn't go bad at all.

1931
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,811
- Do you think everybody was receptive?

1932
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:16,745
- To me?

1933
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:19,582
Yeah, we gotta wait and see.

1934
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,717
- Larue, you handle that problem from earlier?

1935
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,719
- Yeah, his body down in my cellar.

1936
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,853
(phone chimes)

1937
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,255
All right. They just landed.

1938
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:27,189
- All right, boys.

1939
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,458
Let's go meet the new buyer.

1940
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,236
(muffled bang)

1941
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:42,404
- Welcome, welcome.

1942
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,239
You must be Princess.

1943
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,306
I'm Nicko.

1944
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:45,574
Cali's told me a lot about you.

1945
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,508
- Hello, Nicko.

1946
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,377
- Come with me, please.

1947
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,348
(suspenseful music)

1948
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:58,654
Princess, meet my colleagues, Amish and Amara.

1949
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,688
They flew all the way in from India

1950
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,290
to learn this information.

1951
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,992
- We have heard great things about you.

1952
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,960
- Which I hope to be true.

1953
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,529
- Well, I can show you better than I can tell you.

1954
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,566
- Nicko tells us that you have managed to scale your income

1955
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:13,636
by 75% in the last six months.

1956
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,738
- And I hope to do the same for your business.

1957
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:16,872
Did you bring the money?

1958
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,207
- Slow down, Princess.

1959
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,675
You'll get your money.

1960
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,243
Show us this algorithm.

1961
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:24,446
- You see, it's not that simple.

1962
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,281
I have to-

1963
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,115
- Fraud!

1964
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,049
I told you, Amish,

1965
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,117
we should have never come here.

1966
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,419
You wanted to listen to Nicko.

1967
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,621
(speaking foreign language)

1968
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,989
- Hey!

1969
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,457
I said it wasn't simple,

1970
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,359
not impossible.

1971
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,528
Larue, hand me the tablet.

1972
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,733
This is how it works.

1973
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,537
First, you're gonna go here and then

1974
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:49,672
do this.

1975
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:52,141
(piano music)

1976
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,313
- Princess, princess,

1977
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:00,349
I must say I'm impressed.

1978
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,320
Nicko, hand me over the briefcase.

1979
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,689
- Now remember,

1980
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,391
this information is only valid for 90 days.

1981
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,325
- And then what?

1982
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:11,627
We come back to you for more?

1983
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,828
- Well, of course.

1984
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,496
And if we establish a solid network,

1985
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,866
the initiatives are much greater.

1986
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,535
- [Amish] Thank you.

1987
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,874
- Pleasure doing business with you.

1988
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:26,875
- Until next time.

1989
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,911
- [Princess] Yes.

1990
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:31,413
- Princess, we'll be in touch.
