No, no, no. She's got them.

176
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,519
No, no, no, really,
it's no trouble at all.

177
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:09,621
I'll just throw them in
your room for you?

00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,756
Great.

It's room five, Tom. Thanks!

Katherine, I know how difficult
this must be for you.

181
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,163
This work can be
pretty challenging,

182
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:19,765
especially for someone
with your issues.

183
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:21,900
But you should know that
just you being here

to Samantha.

your workbooks

191
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:45,792
and your schedules.

Why don't you settle in,
get comfortable...

00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,563
we'll all meet for introductions
in the great room in an hour.

Wow, there is a lot of stuff
going on.

00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,005
Katherine, if any of these exercises
feel uncomfortable for you,

196
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,174
please just talk to Bob
or myself.

197
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:05,144
We can organize an alternative.

- Okay.
- Great.

199
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,847
I'll see you soon.

200
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,649
Yeah.

201
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,288
What did you tell her?

202
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:17,923
Nothing.

203
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:20,058
I just let her know what
some of your issues are.

204
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:21,159
My issues?

205
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,162
Well, I had to let her know
why we were coming here.

206
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:24,730
So we're here
because of my issues?

207
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:26,533
No, I have issues too.

208
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,901
What did you tell her
my issues were?

209
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:31,036
Hey! You said you wanted to be
able to just hang out by the pool,

210
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,173
so I let her know that some of
this stuff might be hard for you.

211
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:35,975
SAM:
What with your intimacy issues.

212
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:39,579
And your mild social anxiety
disorder.

213
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,283
I don't have social anxiety
disorder.

214
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,285
Which is why I said 'mild'.

215
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:46,852
Why would you tell her that?

216
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,621
So we could skip the exercises.

217
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:58,898
I don't know Sam, I think
it would be a shame to...

218
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,333
...be here and not
take advantage

219
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:02,936
of all of these very helpful
exercises.

So, I guess you'll just have
to talk to Jacqueline

222
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:07,573
if you feel like you
can't handle it.

223
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:08,975
Are you seriously
going to punish me

00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:11,311
just because I made you out
to look a little neurotic?

and I are thrilled

00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:12,804
to be taking this journey
with you.

235
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:16,375
We don't think of ourselves
as teachers, per se.

236
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:19,711
Rather as living examples

237
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:24,017
of how fruitful and rewarding
this work can be.

238
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,818
Much like Shamans.

What Bob is trying to say
is that

we're not really here
to teach you anything new.

241
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:34,126
This work is really about
removing road blocks...

242
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,429
and getting back to why you
fell in love in the first place.

243
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:41,733
You may find that the love
you rediscover here...

244
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:45,772
is greater than any love
you imagined was possible.

245

Amen to that!

tends to be a group experience,

so we hope you'll support each
other through the exercises...

248
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:57,783
and choose to learn from
each others' strengths

249
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,019
as well as each others'
limitations.

for you to consider is

to put up with my shit.

consider, this weekend, Scott,

more seriously

about him is that he's a...

294
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:19,424
he's a great dad
to our daughter...

295
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:24,029
and I'm not sure what I want
him to work on this weekend,

296
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:25,831
because...

297
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:29,302
honestly, he asked me to
come to this, and so I'm here.

And I don't,

299
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,341
I don't really have anything
else to say right now. Sorry.

Uh, this is obviously my wife,
Rebecca.

And, uh, she is a great mother,
and

302
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,917
I think the reason she's having
a difficult time explaining

303
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,419
why we're here this
weekend is because...

304

we used to be great.

I mean, look, I, I know I process
things differently than you,

here, you will realize that we...

learning how to let go...

this weekend, even if that means
just, you know, admitting something

334
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:36,429
might be too hard for you and
just choosing to sit by the pool.

335
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:39,265
Um, maybe

336
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,167
address those demons
that make you act out...

most importantly...

I want to say right now.

This is my boo, Samantha.

Sam, what I love about you

347
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:25,377
is, um, your uncanny ability
to know what I'm thinking

00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,114
- without my even having to say it.
- Hmm.

you've had so, so,

350
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:34,787
so many different partners,

351
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:39,024
you have always made me feel like
I'm in a category all my own.

352
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,126
And, uh,

353
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,264
what I hope you will
consider this weekend is

354
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:46,632
not

355
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:49,335
taking it personally when I

356
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:52,203
don't want to make
love every single day.

357
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:53,773
Sometimes twice a day.

358
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:56,909
Just...

359
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:01,013
know that our needs are different,
and sometimes I'm just tired. Okay?

360
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:05,684
BOB:
Excellent. Thank you.

361
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,586
We were right out
of high school,

362
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:09,788
handyman business. Cash only.

363
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,457
You know, we didn't even
file for income tax.

364
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,394
But then, we got married,
and a couple months into the marriage...

365
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:19,398
Chloe takes over the
business side, and boom.

366
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:21,467
Yeah, he and his brother
had the construction part down,

367
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,435
but forgot all about
the company part.

368
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:27,706
So, I had to step in and crack the
whip on tweedle-dum and tweedle-dumber.

369
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:29,275
[LAUGHTER]

370
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:30,509
Which one am I?

371
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,610
Aww, honey if you have to ask...

372
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,480
Oh, she got ya.

373
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,287
So, have you guys ever taken
one of those Atlantis cruises?

374
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,823
No. No, we did the, uh,
the Rosie O'Donnell cruise.

375
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:46,157
It was awesome.

376
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:47,192
JONAH:
Really?

377
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:49,495
I thought that was primarily
for gay families.

378
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:52,530
We brought my mother.

379
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,467
Kat brought her mother.

380
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,803
My mother's a big fan
of Rosie O'Donnell's.

381
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:01,641
So, you guys are adopting?

382
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:05,110
We are.

383
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,679
JONAH: Are you planning
on having children?

384
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,515
Yeah, maybe someday, um...

385
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:12,518
We kind of just want this time
to be for us right now, you know?

386
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,818
I get it.

387
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,721
You have to know
when the time is right.

388
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,625
David and Rebecca,
you have a daughter?

389
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,528
Carolyn, yeah.
She's really great. Very lucky.

390
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:24,663
Well, we're lucky now.

391
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:27,599
I don't think we slept
the first two years, remember?

392
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,335
Don't tell J.K that.

393
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,571
I do love my sleep.

394
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:37,276
What I remember is that I got up at night
because you couldn't handle the stress.

395
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,244
Remember that?

396
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,447
It was literally like
having two kids.

397
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,450
But it's cool because, you know,
now our daughter's almost a teenager

398
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:46,317
and all she wants to do
is sleep, so...

399
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,321
Unless she's twittering,
or tweetering.

400
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:51,257
It's tweeting.

401
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,526
Tweeting, whatever it's called,
it's annoying.

402
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:54,726
[LAUGHTER]

403
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,095
Well, I don't let it get to me.

404
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,865
I believe that something can't
bother you unless you allow it to.

405
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:00,665
You know?

406
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:07,773
For what it's worth, I think
you'll make wonderful parents.

407
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:13,345
Everyone, we are going to head
down to the fireplace now

408
00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:16,347
for our second exercise
and some dessert.

409
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,383
SUZIE:
Ooh good.

410
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,751
SUZIE:
Yum yum yum.

411
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:30,863
J.K.:
That's so inappropriate.

412
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:31,563
SAM:
So wrong.

413
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:32,964
You've got a little bit there.

414
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:33,798
Want me to kiss it off?

415
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:35,367
Mmmhmm.

416
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,538
So, um, how long
have you been a lesbian?

417
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,907
This next exercise can
appear quite simple, but

418
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,512
please just give yourselves
the gift of being

419
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:50,216
as honest and as open
as you possibly can.

420
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:54,353
Ok, my first heartbreak.

421
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:57,855
I fell in love with a young
man when I was 17,

422
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,559
and we were going
to get married,

423
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:06,398
but I didn't want to start a new life with
him until we had some kind of stability,

424
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:09,434
so I suggested that he enlist

425
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:13,339
in the hope that this would give
him some direction in his life.

426
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:18,377
But he never returned.

427
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,713
And when I found out
that he died,

428
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:27,019
the sense of loss and guilt
was just...

429
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:28,920
completely overwhelming.

430
00:22:28,953 --> 00:22:30,623
So when Bob came into my life

431
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:34,359
I just refused to open
my heart again

432
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,862
for fear of having it broken.

433
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:40,900
But, thanks to this work, and...

434
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,936
this wonderful man...

435
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:47,705
we left that behind us
a long time ago.

436
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:53,011
It's not always easy, but the love
that we share makes it worth it.

437
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,980
Perhaps, um,
Samantha and Katherine

438
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:57,250
could go next.

439
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,689
Okay, um...

440
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,726
Ok, so, I was pretty young,
for mine.

441
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,528
I was, um, 15,

442
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,731
and I had just lost my virginity
to my boyfriend Johnny,

443
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,868
who was a couple years older,

444
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:19,672
and the next night we went
to an AC/DC concert, yeah.

445
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:23,942
And, um, he met some girl there
and he and broke up with me

446
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:26,077
right there at the concert.

447
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,746
It was awful.

448
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:31,416
I pretty much can't hear
AC/DC to this day, so...

449
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,986
No, she really can't.

450
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,490
Okay, uh, my first heartbreak
wasn't actually a relationship.

451
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:41,392
It was my father.

452
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:42,827
Um.

453
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:46,532
My dad traveled a lot for work,
and

454
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:47,566
every time he was leaving
for a trip,

455
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,901
he would come into our room
and he would sing

456
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,970
"Leaving on a Jet Plane" for us.

457
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,871
Oh, I love that song!

458
00:23:53,904 --> 00:23:56,541
Yeah, me too.

459
00:23:56,575 --> 00:23:58,376
Um.

460
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,714
And then one night
when I was six,

461
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:04,650
he came in to the room
and he sang the song,

462
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,752
and this time he
didn't come back.

463
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:11,056
He took off
and started a new family.

464
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,958
And I've only seen him
once since then,

465
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:15,927
and that was 15 years ago, so...

466
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:22,401
Anyway, all I know is that

467
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:25,903
if AC/DC ever does a cover
of "Leaving on a Jet Plane,"

468
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:27,872
we are screwed.

469
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,375
[LAUGHTER]

470
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:31,344
BOB:
Well done.

471
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:35,081
Rebecca and David?

472
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:39,951
Uh, my first heartbreak.

473
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,887
Uh, I guess for me

474
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:45,524
it's been a series
of heartbreaks, really.

475
00:24:45,557 --> 00:24:49,461
Since I met Rebecca she
had a lot of ups and downs.

476
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,696
The most recent one was
that she lost her dad,

477
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,099
and they had a lot of unresolved

478
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,902
issues between them.

479
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:58,436
It broke my heart to

480
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:00,471
see her so broken.

481
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:01,940
Oh, Jesus.

482
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,642
What? What did I do this time?

483
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:05,009
You're doing it again.

484
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:07,412
Do you not see how that sounds?

485
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:12,417
It's like somehow I am damaged
and that's your only issue.

486
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:14,920
My dad died five years ago,

487
00:25:14,952 --> 00:25:18,723
and granted, I did not handle
that well, but I am fine now.

488
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,192
Can we please move on?

489
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:22,827
Well look, I'm sorry.
I just don't trust it, ok?

490
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:26,632
I just can't pretend that I'm not waiting
for the other shoe to drop because it will.

491
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:27,633
It always does.

492
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:30,535
Wow, David. Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

493
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:33,538
If I could just interject
for a second, David.

494
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,607
Our focus is supposed to
be on a prior heartbreak

495
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,509
which is affecting
our current relationship.

496
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,812
Perhaps you could go back to
a time before you met Rebecca.

497
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:43,147
I understand Jacqueline, I do.

498
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:45,017
But the truth is,

499
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,886
anything that happened before
her doesn't really compare.

500
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,224
God, You know, that,
that almost sounds loving.

501
00:25:52,257 --> 00:25:53,525
But you know what?

502
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:55,626
You know, you're the one who
wanted to come here and get honest?

503
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,798
Well the truth is, our marriage
does not work if I'm not a mess,

504
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,201
and I think you hate it that I
don't need you as much anymore.

505
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:04,802
That's a little unfair to me,
don't you think?

506
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:05,770
No, I...

507
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:08,040
You can't expect me
to be a different person

508
00:26:08,073 --> 00:26:11,643
because you just happen
to feel alright this week.

509
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,244
It is not this week.

510
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:15,514
REBECCA: It's been five years.
And I don't expect you

511
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:17,182
REBECCA:
to be a different person.

512
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:21,252
I married you when I was 25 years
old, and I have grown up since then.

513
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:23,020
And I don't think you know
what to do with that.

514
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:24,890
And I see you doing
the same thing with Carolyn.

515
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:26,959
You're terrified that she's
getting a mind of her own.

516
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:28,894
Do not bring her into this.

517
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,963
DAVID:
Look, I still love you, ok?

518
00:26:31,997 --> 00:26:34,833
I still want you. I want this.

519
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:37,068
You're the one that decided
that, that all of the sudden,

520
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:38,737

Why don't you just figure out
who you want to be this week,

When you return to your rooms,

548
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:20,372
we ask that you provide
your partner

549
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:24,710
with a 20 minute
non-sexual massage.

550
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:27,678
This is all about the
therapeutic nature of touch,

551
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:31,083
and just allowing your partner
to bring you to a state of bliss

552

with no expectation
of anything further.

553

of the workbook.

And finally,

00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:40,925
just in order not to dilute the
work that we'll be doing here,

556
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:45,330
we do strongly suggest that you refrain
from having sex while you're here.

No. Come on, come on.

a baby together.

blindfold off! So what?

what it is you're experiencing?

because of an egg.

Why are we even here?

Ok, try this for me.

735
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:16,308
J.K., whatever it is you're
feeling, I want you to cluck it.

each other without the need of words.

Babies are messy, life is messy.

if you can't even let it go here?

00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:50,707
Ok.

747

You want to know the truth?

748
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:52,943
Yeah, that would be nice.

for this.

you're not going to wake up one day

thing isn't for you?

if that's going to happen.

raising a baby with me?

we're going to make it as a couple

quite so strongly to it.

Thanks, Ken.

athletic you are. It's about trust...

you both found that.

You know, Ken and I were friends for

she was a hottie, but, you know,

00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,052
who and what we are attracted
to changes as we grow as people.

We shift perspective,
we open our hearts,

and suddenly

983
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:26,096
we're attracted in different
ways and to different things.

but

1096
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:56,320

find a way to screw it all up.

women it's not about the intimacy.

who are great are first

that there was some attraction.

I will concede to some attraction
if you admit that you had feelings.

1165
00:59:46,688 --> 00:59:48,657
So I'm admitting to gazing
and to feeling?

You know, we are working through
some serious shit here, Kat,

1176
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:11,581
and you just ran off.

1177
01:00:11,614 --> 01:00:13,048
I didn't run. I walked.

1178
01:00:13,081 --> 01:00:16,118

some time to process.

Let's do this.

01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:37,106
So, Chloe,

1186
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:40,543
what I'd like you to do is
discuss an issue that you feel

1187
01:00:40,577 --> 01:00:44,881
either is ongoing, or perhaps
needs to be resolved in a way

1188
01:00:44,914 --> 01:00:48,618
that is constructive
instead of destructive.

1189
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,288
There are so many
to choose from.

1190
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,623
Now Scott, remember,
no interrupting.

1191
01:00:53,655 --> 01:00:54,556
Ok.

1192
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,759
If Chloe says anything
that is a trigger,

1193
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:59,930
just write it on a post-it,
and place it on her.

1194
01:00:59,963 --> 01:01:02,798
For example, if you think your
partner is name-calling,

1195
01:01:02,831 --> 01:01:06,869
just write "name-calling"
and throw that post-it on her.

1196
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:10,106
It lets your partner
share without having to edit.

1197
01:01:11,273 --> 01:01:14,009
Okay, great.

1198
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:17,747
Two weeks ago, I'm making
a turkey for my in-laws,

1199
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:18,949
meaning your family,

1200
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:20,750
and I'm a little stressed out,

1201
01:01:20,782 --> 01:01:22,818
because your family
can be a lot to take.

1202
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:25,288
I go to baste the turkey

1203
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,824
and this guy thinks that
it would be hilarious

1204
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:31,928
to shove a beer can up its ass

1205
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,228
and stand it up on
its little hind legs

1206
01:01:33,262 --> 01:01:35,731
so it looked like it
was running away.

Chloe, does this happen often?

1208
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:39,969
Sort of. You know.
Or stuff like it.

01:01:40,003 --> 01:01:42,105
It's not always the poultry.

Why don't you address
Scott directly.

01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,675
Not a problem, Bob.

1212
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,144
You stood him up,

1213
01:01:48,177 --> 01:01:50,347
put little cauliflower
sneakers on him,

1214
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,248

broccoli for hair.

It also scared
the crap out of me.

A running turkey in the oven
is a very freaky thing.

- Aaaah! No talking!

the entire way

It's just that she

I wasn't trying to be
an asshole.

I was just trying
to make you laugh.

I'll start.

1271
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,398
As we've discussed many times before,
you have some real issues with boundaries,

1272
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:33,468
and you are constantly
crossing mine

1273
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:37,340
and not worrying about
how that makes me feel.

1274
01:05:42,077 --> 01:05:47,050
For example, on my birthday,
you took my massage gift certificate.

1275

Uh-uh. No talking.

1277
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:55,592
Now, I don't like massages, but it
would have been nice to have been asked.

1278
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,360
Oh, and she took
my coasters too.

1279
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:03,967
It really shows up when there's
something that we need to talk about,

1280
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,103
something that maybe you're ready
to talk about, but I'm not ready to,

1281
01:06:08,137 --> 01:06:12,008
because maybe sometimes
I need time to process things

1282
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,978
before I'm ready to talk
about them,

1283
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,512
and I don't feel
that you respect that.

1284
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:19,348

it's as if it's the first time
I've heard you say it.

01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:38,668
I am glad to give you the time
you need to process things,

1293
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:41,336
as long as you let me know
that I'm not the only one

1294
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:44,206
who thinks that there
is something to talk about.

1295
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,242
I can wait to talk about something
as long as I know that you know

that there is something
to talk about.

in a room

thinking that I'm the only one
who thinks that there's something

pretty huge that
we need to talk about.

when I took your birthday presents.

- Kat, would you like to...
- Sure.

There are a lot of things

that maybe wouldn't
be so funny now.

flirt to get attention.

that didn't bother me before

1554
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,796
Ok, um, there was a moment when
Kat and I thought that maybe

1555
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:32,033
we were attracted to each other,
which is just ridiculous.

1556
01:20:32,067 --> 01:20:34,869
Why is that ridiculous?

1557
01:20:34,903 --> 01:20:37,472
Because she's Kat, you know?
She's my best friend.

1558
01:20:37,506 --> 01:20:41,944
I don't see the problem. Isn't
that what we're all looking for?

1559
01:20:41,976 --> 01:20:44,747
I'm so turned on right now.

1560
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:47,315
JACQUELINE:
Samantha, it took courage

1561
01:20:47,349 --> 01:20:49,184
to stand here and apologize.

1562
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:53,855
And I think we all appreciate,
if nothing else, you making amends.

1563
01:20:53,889 --> 01:21:00,061
Um, uh, wait a second. I have
something I'd like to say.

1564
01:21:00,095 --> 01:21:03,999
You know, Jonah and I came
here for a very serious reason.

1565
01:21:04,032 --> 01:21:06,534
This weekend had
a lot of meaning for us.

1566
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:08,503
JONAH:
And the worst part of it.

1567
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:11,340
We actually like you guys.

1568
01:21:11,372 --> 01:21:16,478
I mean, did you think you'd come and
have some laughs at the pathetic couples?

1569
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:18,948
J.K.:
Well guess what?

1570
01:21:20,849 --> 01:21:23,018
We are those pathetic couples

1571
01:21:23,952 --> 01:21:24,953
[THUD]

1572
01:21:24,987 --> 01:21:26,889
J.K.: And some of us
really needed to be here.

1573
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:28,823
Not in some theoretical way, but

1574
01:21:29,925 --> 01:21:31,393
actually really needed

1575
01:21:31,426 --> 01:21:36,966
to work things out to be better
parents to our future child.

1576
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,069
J.K.:
And you wasted our time.

1577
01:21:41,936 --> 01:21:44,239
I find that very hard
to forgive.

1578
01:21:46,942 --> 01:21:48,176
J.K., Jonah,

1579
01:21:49,277 --> 01:21:51,145
the truth is,

1580
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:54,382
I did think we'd end up
laughing at you.

1581
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:55,583
SAM:
I thought that you were all

1582
01:21:55,617 --> 01:21:58,520
gonna be a little ridiculous.

1583
01:21:58,552 --> 01:22:02,023
And I, uh, I couldn't have
been further from the truth.

1584
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:05,993
JONAH:
Holy hell,

1585
01:22:06,027 --> 01:22:06,962
you look like shit.

1586
01:22:06,994 --> 01:22:08,831
I know. I was up all night,
I just told you.

1587
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:10,565
No, I think he means me.

1588
01:22:10,599 --> 01:22:12,234
Oh Jesus.

1589
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:16,438
- Hi.
- Hi.

1590
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:18,573
I came back.

1591
01:22:18,606 --> 01:22:19,475
I see that.

1592
01:22:21,408 --> 01:22:23,511
KAT:
Um,

1593
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:28,483
okay. Everybody, I want
to apologize for lying.

1594
01:22:28,515 --> 01:22:30,219
Uh, Sam and I are
not in a relationship...

1595
01:22:30,252 --> 01:22:31,920
They know everything.

1596
01:22:31,953 --> 01:22:34,623
Oh. Ok. Great.

1597
01:22:34,655 --> 01:22:37,492
I wanted to... did you tell them I
don't have social anxiety disorder?

1598
01:22:37,524 --> 01:22:39,060
- Yes.
- Ok.

1599
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:44,265
Um, listen, I have

1600
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:48,237
no idea what's going on
between us, but I

1601
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,338
took off last night because

1602
01:22:49,371 --> 01:22:51,340
I was scared to find out. And,

1603
01:22:53,007 --> 01:22:54,876
when we kissed, I think that I...

1604
01:22:56,578 --> 01:22:57,847
Now they know everything.

1605
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:05,954
Look, I don't know what kind of Jedi
mind trick happened this weekend, but

1606
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,425
Something hit me
as I was driving here.

1607
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:12,994
KAT:
You were right.

1608
01:23:13,028 --> 01:23:15,564
I am a chicken shit.

1609
01:23:15,596 --> 01:23:18,332
Every relationship I'm in,
I keep a certain amount of distance,

1610
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:22,436
and that way when it ends,
it doesn't hurt too badly.

1611
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:25,207
But I realized that I don't
do that with friends,

1612
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:28,109
because there is no end date
in friendships.

1613
01:23:28,143 --> 01:23:32,280
And I don't ever think for a second that you
and I won't be in each others' lives forever.

1614
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:35,050
I mean, you're my best friend.

1615
01:23:37,452 --> 01:23:42,591
And look, there's a lot of reasons
that this might not work out. I mean,

1616
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:46,194
I mean, I'm still a closed off mess,
you're still an attention whore.

1617
01:23:47,628 --> 01:23:49,997
And...

1618
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:52,234
I guess I should be freaked out
about the fact that you're a woman,

1619
01:23:52,266 --> 01:23:53,301
but I'm not.

1620
01:23:57,271 --> 01:24:00,475
For the first time in my life,
I want what you all have.

1621
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,079
KAT:
I want to at least try.

1622
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:08,317
With you.

1623
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:10,351
KAT:
I think.

1624
01:24:15,122 --> 01:24:15,690
Wow.

1625
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,225
KAT:
I'm sorry...

1626
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,195
I just went all Jerry Maguire
and you respond with "Wow"?

1627
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:24,032
I'm processing. You're not
the only one who processes.

1628
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:26,033
SAM:
Ok, just listen.

1629
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:28,603
There was some truth
to what you said about me too.

1630
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:31,606
I do jump from relationship
to relationship, and I,

1631
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:35,344
I know it looks like I just
want the attention, but

1632
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:37,412
I do want more than that.

1633
01:24:37,444 --> 01:24:40,282
The only thing I know
after this fucking weekend

1634
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:42,616
is that I like the day to day
with you.

1635
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:45,119
And I never get bored with you.

1636
01:24:45,153 --> 01:24:47,389
And truthfully, it,

1637
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:49,357
it broke my heart
when I thought I lost you.

1638
01:24:51,192 --> 01:24:52,426
SAM:
I have no idea what this thing

1639
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,596
is between us, and,

1640
01:24:54,628 --> 01:24:56,664
to tell the truth, the stuff
that works between us as friends

1641
01:24:56,698 --> 01:24:58,633
could be disastrous
in a relationship.

1642
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,900
I get it.

1643
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:01,469
SAM: You have some real issues
around emotional withholding,

1644
01:25:01,502 --> 01:25:05,073
and I'm sure I have some issues that could
be difficult in a relationship too...

1645
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:07,541
Yeah, like the fact that
you never shut up?

1646
01:25:07,574 --> 01:25:09,444
Or the fact that you're
a miserable bitch?

1647
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:19,253
Look, if we want what they all have, then
we have to risk the other stuff too, and...

1648
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:22,289
I'd be willing to try.
With you.

1649
01:25:22,323 --> 01:25:22,992

1650
01:25:24,692 --> 01:25:26,595
- You think?
- Really?

1651
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:28,095
You said "I think."
Why is that ok?

1652
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:29,331
Oh my god.
I don't believe this.

1653
01:25:29,363 --> 01:25:30,698
Oh my god.

- Sure.

we have another session in three weeks.

01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,444
You should go.
