1
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,482
Man overboard! Man overboard!

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,610
Man overboard!

3
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,154
Ma...

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,114
Man overboard!

5
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,620
Man overboard!

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,831
Man overboard!

7
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,252
Man overboard!

8
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,927
All hands stand by on deck.

9
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,722
Please remain calm.

10
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,124
Quite a hoax.

11
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,084
This dummy made of pillows.

12
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,087
I don't know anything about this.

13
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,507
What did you call it again?

14
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,591
Hoax.

15
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,303
We have two witnesses who saw you
push this dummy overboard.

16
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,555
Witnesses?

17
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,599
The Bradley brothers?

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,227
Couple of runty finks.

19
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,312
I should have pushed them overboard.

20
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,023
-Harvey!
-So what?

21
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,399
I did it.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,360
It was a joke.

23
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,115
Thanks to your thoughtless joke, the lives
of our crewmen were put in jeopardy.

24
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,409
False alarms take the edge off
our crew's readiness.

25
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,912
When a true emergency arises,

26
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,413
our crew will be skeptical.

27
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,623
I know. I know.

28
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,667
That's me.

29
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,418
The boy who cried "wolf."

30
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,003
This prank of yours was also very costly.

31
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,339
Two hours time was lost.

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,966
Money.

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,301
You know, I knew we'd get around to this.

34
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,303
My lawyer here will write you a check.

35
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,139
Whatever amount you say.

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,058
There is more involved here
than dollars and cents.

37
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,935
Take care of it, Wade.

38
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,061
Just a moment, young man.

39
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,271
Harvey...

40
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,565
Let him go.

41
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,029
I really am very, very sorry about this.

42
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,699
Please, give me a bill
for the costs incurred.

43
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,868
I warn you, Mr. Wade,

44
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,245
keep that insufferable brat in check

45
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,914
or I'll confine him to his quarters
for the remainder of the voyage.

46
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,125
If we had a brig,
I'd be tempted to throw him in it.

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,211
Well, Harvey...

48
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,255
Harvey can be difficult.

49
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,340
But he's not entirely to blame.

50
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,594
We have to remember that the boy
was orphaned at eight months.

51
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,430
And our law firm is the only family
he's ever known.

52
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,556
Spare me.

53
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,684
One of the richest people in the world,
isn't he?

54
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,353
Yes, he is,

55
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,981
but as you yourself pointed out, sir,

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,151
dollars and cents aren't the answer
to everything.

57
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,040
Well, you've set
a new record for rudeness.

58
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,251
What am I supposed to say,
"You pompous old windbag"?

59
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,047
The purser is a man
with an enormous responsibility

60
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,840
who is only trying to do his job.

61
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,137
You self-centered, mindless little idiot.

62
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,020
Did you know
I could hear underwater, Wade?

63
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,522
I don't want to lecture you, Harvey.

64
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,358
Good.

65
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,401
But I do want to warn you.

66
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,821
If you cause any more trouble
on this voyage,

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,824
the purser means to confine you
to your cabin.

68
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,452
He can't do that.

69
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,912
Yes, he can.

70
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,042
If he tries it, I want him fired.

71
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,044
Don't be ridiculous.

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,464
My trust owns a lot of stock
in this shipping line, right?

73
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,969
And if the Cheyne Trust wants
a rude employee fired...

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,515
We have
six days left on this ship.

75
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,517
I want you to enjoy yourself,

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,477
but not at the expense of others.

77
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,230
This trip is boring.

78
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,734
If word of your misbehavior
makes the English newspapers,

79
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,444
and Greyfriars hears of it,

80
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,154
they won't admit you.

81
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,573
Hey, great.

82
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,410
We can spend the whole year
bumming around.

83
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,204
Thanks, Wade.
I've been looking for a way out.

84
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,165
Now, instead of boring classes
in drizzly England,

85
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,586
we could go to Paris, the Riviera,
Monte Carlo...

86
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,547
If Greyfriars refuses you,

87
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,173
you're on your own.

88
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,304
We'll see what Caniff, Tourcel and Wade
have to say about that.

89
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,556
I don't give a hoot in hell what they say.

90
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,145
You can be fired, too, you know.

91
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,606
Well, that will be
the happiest day of my life.

92
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,526
When I was first offered this job,

93
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,821
I was naive enough to believe
that you and I could be friends.

94
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,282
Harvey Cheyne with a friend.

95
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,993
You'll never have a friend

96
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,704
because you never think
of anyone else but yourself.

97
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,664
Where are you going?

98
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,958
I asked you a question!

99
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
Go again.

100
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,234
Come on.

101
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,528
Give me what I need.

102
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,573
Got it!

103
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,952
Am I hot or am I hot?

104
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,746
The dice, I think, need to cool off.

105
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,498
-Let's start a new pair.
-No.

106
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,665
No.

107
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,585
I like the way these little babies
are rolling.

108
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,879
-Go again.
<i>-Uno momento.</i>

109
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,548
I need to settle myself.

110
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,063
Nothing like a big stogie
to settle you down

111
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,065
when the ship begins to pitch up and down.

112
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
An old sea dog like you knows that.

113
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,361
Sure. Let's go.

114
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,278
Here. Here.

115
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,280
Have one.

116
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,242
Thanks.

117
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,077
Left mine in the cabin.

118
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,873
You probably smoke only Cubanos,
but this is the best I can afford.

119
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,065
Not too bad. Let's go.

120
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,359
Okay.

121
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,699
Yes!

122
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,576
That is good. Very good.

123
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,373
Now, I show you how
to make these little ones dance.

124
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,168
Hey, where you goin'?

125
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,294
You can't leave now.

126
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,713
Hey, give us a chance
to win our money back.

127
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,007
Hey, come back. Come on.

128
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,321
Come back! Do you hear me?

129
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,199
Help!

130
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,037
Come back!

131
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,788
Come back.

132
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,874
Come back!

133
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,710
Please.

134
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,878
Help!

135
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,672
Help!

136
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,676
Come back!

137
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,324
Hold on! Hold on.

138
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,248
Hold on, now.

139
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,713
Hold on, we're coming!

140
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,807
Take... Take my hand.

141
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,642
Hold my hand.

142
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,143
Come on!

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,154
Did I drown?

144
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,073
Did he drown?

145
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,619
Sure. You drowned,

146
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,079
and you go to heaven.

147
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,166
How did you pitch over?

148
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,127
Rough water...

149
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,588
Cigar...

150
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,299
Couldn't help it.

151
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,175
You are one lucky fellow.

152
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,345
We figured you'd be cut to pieces
by the ship's screw.

153
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,763
The backwash carried you to safety.

154
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,101
Just... Take me back to the liner.

155
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,645
Too late. No way we're gonna catch up now.

156
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,732
I have to get back on board.

157
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,359
No, no, no. We go to schooner.

158
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,278
But you don't understand.

159
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,572
I have to get back on that liner.

160
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,914
Feeling better?

161
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,005
You didn't listen to me.

162
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,592
I told you I had to get back
to that liner.

163
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,514
Have some coffee.

164
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,601
I use cream.

165
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,561
Do you?

166
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,773
Where do you think you are?

167
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,527
Not likely to see milk of any kind
before the middle of September.

168
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,405
Nearest cow's about 500 miles away.

169
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,365
I saved you this from breakfast.

170
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,134
I'll have fresh fruit, a poached egg,

171
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,260
and a rasher of bacon.

172
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,054
Not here you won't.

173
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,348
Take what you can while you can.

174
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,687
Who's in charge here?

175
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,022
Captain Troop.

176
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,774
Captain Matthew Troop.

177
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,526
I'm his son, Dan.

178
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,821
Cook's helper and anything
that's too dirty for the men to do.

179
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,824
This captain and me
better have a little talk.

180
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,618
He said the same thing.

181
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,040
These are some pretty crazy clothes
you were wearing.

182
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,834
They seem to have shrunk some.

183
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,544
Is the boy on his feet yet?

184
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,004
Just getting dressed, Dad.

185
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,755
Tell him I wanna see him.

186
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,884
You heard. That's the Captain.

187
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,429
If he wants to see me,

188
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,930
let him come down here.

189
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,435
Hey, Dad, he says you can come down
and see him if you're anxious.

190
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,352
You hear, Dad?

191
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,938
Quit your foolin', Dan, and send him up.

192
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,025
The Captain would prefer
to see you on deck.

193
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,443
Sunlight'll do you good.

194
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,833
Good morning.

195
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,711
Or good afternoon.
You've nigh slept the clock around.

196
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,840
So, time to set the record straight.

197
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,592
Name, where from, where bound?

198
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,429
Harvey Cheyne, Jr.

199
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,015
I was aboard the <i>Rotterdam</i>
bound for Southampton.

200
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,351
Now, you're to take me to New York.

201
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,977
The faster we move,

202
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,354
the better it'll pay you.

203
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,356
Pay me? Just what would it pay me?

204
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,900
In dollars and cents.

205
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,610
Hard cash.

206
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,238
Didn't you connect the name?

207
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,865
Cheyne. Harvey Cheyne.

208
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,285
I do recall some Cheynes down Narraganset.

209
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,828
Clam diggers.

210
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:55,042
Look, you did the best day's work
of your life when you pulled me in.

211
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,088
Now, let's get this tub under sail,

212
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,173
headed for New York.

213
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
We never go to New York.

214
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,135
Or Boston.

215
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,012
Gloucester's our home port.

216
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,266
If we did take you to New York,
what be in it for us?

217
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,142
Fifty dollars? Twenty-five?

218
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,395
Twenty-five dollars.

219
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,607
I'll show you money.
Real money. Almost $200.

220
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,195
My wallet!

221
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,322
It's been stolen.

222
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,658
What would a boy your age

223
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,994
be doing with almost $200 in his wallet?

224
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,745
Part of my monthly allowance.

225
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,872
Just part of it.

226
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,124
You didn't by chance
hit your head on anything

227
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,166
as you fell yesterday?

228
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,253
Look, I had almost $200 in there,

229
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,088
and someone on this boat stole it!

230
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,175
Mister, so far there's just three things
about you I'm sure of.

231
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,511
You fell off a boat.

232
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,222
You got a tongue that doesn't stop.

233
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,473
And you're a liar.

234
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,227
No one on this ship
took any money from you.

235
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,105
Okay. Okay. Forget the $200.

236
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,774
What will it take to get me to New York?

237
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,862
There's no way we can go back now.
We just come to these fishing grounds.

238
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,656
With good luck, we'll be ashore again
the first weeks of September.

239
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,867
It's only May.

240
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,286
I'm not gonna sit around here
doing nothing

241
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,829
just 'cause you feel like fishing.

242
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,123
Fishing is our livelihood.

243
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,251
There are seven of us on board.

244
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,838
If we go back now, it's more than
1,000 mile, we lose the season's catch.

245
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,674
What we catch and sell
is seven men's bread.

246
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,304
I will make it up. My trust will pay
you and your crewmen whatever you lose.

247
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,474
What are we talking about?
$5,000? $10,000?

248
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,392
You'll have it.

249
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,645
Just take me to New York.

250
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,146
No.

251
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,649
Okay. Doesn't have to be New York.

252
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,567
Just pull in to the nearest port.

253
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,319
Telephone one of the Cheyne companies

254
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,613
in Boston, Hartford, New York...

255
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,782
Too far from any port to put you ashore.

256
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,201
You're with us for three months
and lucky to be alive.

257
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,369
Yeah, for three months.

258
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,163
What am I supposed to do
on a fish-kettle for three months?

259
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,290
You'll work. We take no passengers.

260
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,833
I'll pay you ten and a half a month.

261
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,252
You won't be worth it, of course,
but who knows, you may learn.

262
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,673
Are you saying you expect me
to scrub decks,

263
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,675
clean pots and pans?

264
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,011
Can't I get it through your thick head
who I am?

265
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,514
I am Harvey Cheyne, Jr.

266
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,684
I can buy and sell this stinking boat
ten million times over.

267
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,645
Now, take me to New York!

268
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,648
Suit yourself.

269
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,900
You don't work, you don't eat,

270
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,694
and you have no bunk.

271
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,863
Dan will show you.
Go forward and give him a hand.

272
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,922
Come in.

273
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,843
A reply to your New York cable, sir.

274
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,052
Thank you.

275
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,933
I'm to go back to New York
on your return voyage.

276
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,019
You are booked in your present cabin.

277
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,522
These things of Master Harvey's,
we'll put in storage.

278
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,150
This must be difficult.

279
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,278
Harvey and I,

280
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,573
we didn't get on.

281
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,742
The last day, I...

282
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,412
I said some cruel things to him.

283
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,707
True, but still...

284
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,836
Trying to act as a parent
without having the authority.

285
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,715
Behind that spoiled brat facade,

286
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,009
I always felt there was a person

287
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,926
of great potential.

288
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,639
He never had a chance to find out
who he was or...

289
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,892
what he might become.

290
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,277
Seat ye! Seat ye!

291
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,945
I'm starving.

292
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,992
I've been looking forward to this all day.

293
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,454
A little bit of extra just for you.

294
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,293
Could you pass me the bread, please?

295
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,131
I think I'll have another.

296
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,842
Pass, pass me more. I'll get it myself.

297
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,934
You put in two of those beans
and three of the other.

298
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,018
Who would know?

299
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,770
Dad would know.

300
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,897
He'd know before he even tasted it.

301
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,232
Just from the smell.

302
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,775
Yes, that man would.

303
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,610
Do it right, Dan.

304
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,862
The coffee fixes his temper
for the whole day.

305
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,121
Let the weather be good
and the cod be plentiful.

306
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,006
I can smell the new beans.

307
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,728
I think we've found the right combination.

308
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,023
It took some time.

309
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,401
Tomorrow, bring two mugs,
I'll share it with you.

310
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,986
Thanks.

311
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,280
Dan.

312
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,073
You're growing fast.

313
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,368
Another year, you'll be doing
a full man's job on the ship.

314
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,788
You mean I can order somebody else around?

315
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,542
No. I mean you can take on
more of my duties.

316
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,378
But speaking of somebody else
to order around...

317
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,255
He's still just sitting up there.

318
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,508
As if I don't have enough natural worries.

319
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,303
I've got to worry about this spoiled
puppy dog dropped onto me.

320
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,931
Says his thanks for saving his life
by calling us thieves.

321
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,267
I think he was talking out of his head.

322
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,395
He was near drowning
and ended up with us strangers.

323
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,022
He's the strange one.

324
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,607
Barking orders
like some drunken first mate.

325
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,109
Bragging on about his money.

326
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,821
A night on deck with nothing to eat
has likely brought him to his senses.

327
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,740
I've said all I had to say to him.

328
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,158
I made him a fair offer.

329
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,660
It's up to him now
to go to work or go hungry.

330
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,246
Seems an easy choice to me.

331
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,914
Aye.

332
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,799
This can't go on.

333
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,510
I've never been so hungry.

334
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,345
You should think.

335
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,430
Look.

336
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,309
Maybe you could talk some sense
into your father.

337
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,269
When we get to New York,

338
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,812
I'll make it worth your while.

339
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,856
I'm not interested in your money.

340
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,192
Even though you think I stole it from you.

341
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,152
I shouldn't have said that.

342
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,029
I wish you'd forget it.

343
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,948
I need another boy on my side.

344
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,995
I could use some help with the chores.

345
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,041
Look, I'm not doing dirty work
for a servant's wages.

346
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,960
Less than a bar steward gets paid
on the <i>Rotterdam.</i>

347
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,421
You're not cruising on
a fancy ocean liner.

348
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,507
You're Second Boy on a fishing schooner.

349
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,467
You seem smart enough.

350
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,720
If you are, you'll remember
how you got here and do what's necessary.

351
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,809
I offered your father $10,000
to take me home.

352
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,646
Tell him I'll give him $20,000, $30,000.

353
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,732
It doesn't have to be New York.

354
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,695
I mean, I'll give him $25,000
just to drop me off at a decent port.

355
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,449
Tell him.

356
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,244
I'm not telling Dad anything so stupid.

357
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,538
And if I did, he wouldn't listen.

358
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,373
You're the one to talk to him.

359
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,708
If I was you, I wouldn't go bragging
about my money

360
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,418
that no one believes you have.

361
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,587
First thing I'd say is thank you.

362
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,590
If it wasn't for us, where do you reckon
you'd be right now?

363
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,093
-Think about it.
-Dan.

364
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,556
-Okay.
-There we go.

365
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,559
Ahoy! Gang way!

366
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,728
Come.

367
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,946
Well?

368
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,868
Well, we seem to have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

369
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:19,583
I've been told you think
I haven't acted quite right.

370
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,336
I realize it wouldn't be easy
for a man like you

371
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,213
to understand where I'm coming from.

372
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,428
Of course, I do appreciate
what your men have done for me,

373
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,473
and, in good time, I'll see that
they are properly paid for it.

374
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,022
You just can't bring yourself to say,
"Thank you," and, "I'm sorry," can you?

375
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,152
-Consider it said.
-No.

376
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,197
Thank you.

377
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,907
I'm sorry.

378
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,828
Very well, then. Go about your work.

379
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,001
Look, instead of you paying me
ten and a half a month for work,

380
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,047
how about letting me pay you $100 a month
for my passage?

381
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,883
Maybe another $50 for Dan to be my valet?

382
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,384
No passengers.

383
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,888
Look, what do I have to do
to make you see this my way?

384
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,474
On this ship, boy,

385
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,684
there's one way, my way.

386
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,520
Now, if you want to eat, go to work.
It's up to you.

387
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,575
Come on,
give it some elbow grease, Harvey.

388
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,120
If it's not clean as a whistle,
Captain'll have us do it again.

389
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,082
You know, the worst part about work
is that it's boring.

390
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,334
I'll tell you what,

391
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,877
we'll mix scrubbing with learning.

392
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,003
I'll teach you about the ship.

393
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,755
Yeah, I'll be twice as bored.

394
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:55,345
Staysail, foresail, mainsail, riding sail.

395
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,764
Isn't she a daisy?

396
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,226
Wait till our mainsail's set,
and she walks home with her salt all wet.

397
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,727
This is worse than school.

398
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,063
Okay, now when I say,
"With her salt all wet,"

399
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,440
I mean with her hull
full of salted-down fish.

400
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,818
We wet the salt when we stow the fish.

401
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,112
Salt's all wet. Good catch.

402
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,950
Main hatch. It's empty now.

403
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,535
It's our job to fill it with fish.

404
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,871
Salted down. Hundred hogshead of salt
in those bins down there.

405
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,956
What's a hogshead?

406
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,750
They're comin' in.

407
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,260
Yeah. All right.
Let her down easy.

408
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,180
-What's your catch?
-239.

409
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,392
Hey. So...

410
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,020
You feel some pretty well now, huh?

411
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,772
Hello?

412
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,318
This time, the other day,

413
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,903
the fish, they fish for you.

414
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,740
So you're the one who dumped me
in with the fish.

415
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,451
That's Harvey's way of saying "thank you."

416
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,705
No big thanks to Manuel.

417
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,082
What do I to? I leave you to drift?

418
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,711
Maybe.

419
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,506
So, now you are big fisherman.

420
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,008
Catch.

421
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,552
Clean out Manuel's dory.

422
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,554
Come on.

423
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,973
Scrub good.

424
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,042
Not so fast.

425
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,128
A job half done isn't done at all.

426
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,673
Hike out the floor boards.
They slide in the grooves.

427
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,511
Never let a floor board jam,
the man may need it very bad some day.

428
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,971
On this ship, boy,

429
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,141
we each do our best
because our surviving depends on it.

430
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,976
If I do my best,

431
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,270
will you offer me $11 a month?

432
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,316
In a year or two, maybe.

433
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,874
Here, let me help you.

434
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,592
So, this is our passenger, eh?

435
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,637
The Captain's got you hard at it already?

436
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,013
Yeah, well, he would.

437
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,184
My name's Jack, Long Jack.

438
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,438
A British Tar, as you can tell.

439
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,064
British, is it?

440
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,358
I'll give you British.

441
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,609
Eh? Eh!

442
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,694
The impudence.

443
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,612
And me as Irish as the shamrock.

444
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,657
I tell you, you beware of this Danny Boy.

445
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,201
He's a terrible, terrible person.
What are you?

446
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,662
-A terrible, terrible person.
-Yeah, right.

447
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,748
He'll corrupt you inside a week
if you let him.

448
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,167
Now, you get out of my way

449
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,793
before I gives you one.

450
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,680
I think it's 42.

451
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,308
Then my luck's turned at last.
I counted 45.

452
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,685
Well, 42 or 47, I lost count.

453
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,687
Never could count, anyway.

454
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,522
That's my uncle, Salters.

455
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,816
He's arguing with Little Penn
about who caught more fish.

456
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,904
Seat ye! Seat ye!

457
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,198
Dinner time.

458
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,867
All right. About time.

459
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,798
Pass the bread, please.

460
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,717
Thanks.

461
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,385
So, how old are you, lad?

462
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,889
-Fourteen.
-Oh.

463
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,017
Same age I was when I went to sea.

464
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,811
Just as green as you are.

465
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,813
Not much has changed in 20 years.

466
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,689
Hey.

467
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,528
It must be a sad thing, for your father
and mother, thinking you drowned.

468
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,572
My mother and father are dead.

469
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,160
I was eight months old
when they died in a train wreck.

470
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,080
An orphan.

471
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,837
Well, what were you doing
on that liner, then?

472
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,714
Going to England.

473
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,091
To boarding school.

474
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,677
What? One of them snobby English schools?

475
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,928
-You're better off without it.
-Mmm.

476
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,305
We teach you good right here.

477
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,348
And you get paid for it.

478
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,314
It looks like you could do with a snooze.

479
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,444
Dressing down,
we put him on the move, huh?

480
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,572
We'll have him pitch.

481
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,576
What's dressing down?

482
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,412
Pitch what?

483
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,496
We'll show you.

484
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,123
You'll like it.

485
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,482
Good pitch, Harv.

486
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,944
Boy, pitch 'em bunched.

487
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,362
Try not to scatter.

488
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,239
Go on. Pitch.

489
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,882
Boy, wait.

490
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,343
You and Dan have first watch.

491
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,429
Not me. I'm for bed.

492
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,014
After you stand watch.

493
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,266
I did my job.

494
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,185
I worked hard.

495
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,062
I need sleep.

496
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,316
Come on, Harv. You and me.

497
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,902
After dressing down, boys clean up.

498
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,863
And in calm weather,
boys take first watch.

499
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,281
Says who?

500
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
Me.

501
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,541
When we get to shore,
I'll make you pay for this.

502
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,002
Maybe.

503
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,055
Leave me alone.

504
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,975
You're on watch. Stay awake.

505
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,893
The men are counting on you.

506
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,353
They sleep, I sleep.

507
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,738
Stop it!

508
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,702
Come on, Harvey, stop it.
I don't want to hurt you.

509
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,336
You have to stay awake.

510
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,714
All right. All right!

511
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,924
I'll stay awake.

512
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,151
Dad's studying the fish.

513
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,570
It's him and what he knows
against the cod.

514
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,405
What he knows?

515
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,742
Weather, winds, currents, food.

516
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,078
Only he sees it through the eyes
of a 20-pound codfish.

517
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,497
It's like he becomes a cod.

518
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,292
That's what makes him
the ace fisherman on the Banks.

519
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,087
Okay, it's okay, now.

520
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,800
-Dad?
-Aye?

521
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,427
We've finished our chores.

522
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,763
Later, can we go overside a piece?

523
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,181
It's good catching weather.

524
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,768
Not in that fancy rig he's wearing,

525
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,063
or those half-baked shoes.

526
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,938
Find him something fit to wear.

527
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,193
These were tailored just for me.

528
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,902
One of a kind.

529
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,072
I would hope so.

530
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,255
Dad keeps my spare gear in here.

531
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,305
Your mom looks nice.

532
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,853
I didn't know you had a sister.

533
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,983
I don't.

534
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,070
She died.

535
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,489
Died?

536
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,075
She's just a kid.

537
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,536
She had a ruptured appendix.

538
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,080
Nearest hospital's 30 miles.

539
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,083
By the time we got her there,
it was too late.

540
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,837
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,549
My mom still cries
when she thinks nobody's around.

542
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,014
Here. Try these on.

543
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,730
Isn't it beautiful?

544
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,733
My dad gave it to me for my birthday.

545
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,945
Too handsome to wear.

546
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,699
Here you go.

547
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,284
This should keep your brains dry.

548
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,262
Passable.

549
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,393
Practical.

550
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,162
She belongs to me.

551
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,955
My very own.

552
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,251
Who's "Hattie S"?

553
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,670
Someone I know in Gloucester.

554
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,089
A girl?

555
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,301
That she is.

556
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,511
Grab the rope over there.

557
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,472
Just attach it to the end, will you?

558
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
Sure.

559
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,448
Here we go.

560
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:35,670
Wow!

561
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,339
Muckle, Harv. Muckle.

562
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,423
Right there.

563
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,550
By your hand.

564
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,021
Hey, your turn.

565
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,481
I got one. I got one!

566
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,399
Okay.

567
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,359
Give it some room, Harv.

568
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,819
That's a big one.

569
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,571
Here, let me help you with that.

570
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,286
Oh, no! It's my first fish. All mine.

571
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,957
Is it a whale?

572
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,875
A halibut, maybe.

573
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,920
I'd be willing to bet my entire salary

574
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,672
that that weighs 100 pounds.

575
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,936
Good work, Harv.

576
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,231
It weighs more than I do.

577
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,069
You know, I just wish
those know-it-all stewards

578
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,155
on the <i>Rotterdam</i> could see me now.

579
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,540
What's going on?

580
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,585
Anchor's fouled.

581
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,129
Penn's always losing anchors.

582
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,261
Oh, Danny.

583
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,472
This is so good of you.

584
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,689
Again, I thank you.

585
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,275
You're the angel of the Banks, Danny.

586
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,155
That mix is a good sign.

587
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,115
How's that for a halibut?

588
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,120
It's not bad.

589
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,956
Harvey caught it. His first fish.

590
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,127
We'll be raising anchor.

591
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,549
Harvey's trying.

592
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,302
Don't you think he deserves
a kind word now and then?

593
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,853
Hey, grab the rope, will you?

594
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,642
Harv, bait like this.

595
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,521
Hurry it along.

596
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,232
I want these lines out
and the dories back before dark.

597
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,945
Boy, stop your dawdling
and day-dreaming. Finish up.

598
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,198
Watch how you bait.
It'll be off before it touches the water.

599
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,200
Tight. Coil it tight.

600
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,202
We'll end with nothing
but a nest of tangles.

601
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,328
Catch Dan's rhythm, can't you?

602
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,748
No, I can't. I'm not Dan.

603
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,127
If you don't like the way
I'm doing the job, do it yourself.

604
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,754
I try and I try to please you.

605
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,173
Never can. Never will.

606
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,259
Harder I work at it,
the more you criticize, put me down.

607
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,637
Well, Captain Know-it-all Troop,
you can go to the devil.

608
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,682
And take your trawl lines,
pitchforks and stinking fish with you.

609
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,642
Just put me on another boat. Any boat.

610
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,104
And someday I'm gonna buy
this stinking, old tub and sink it.

611
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,443
Leave him be.

612
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,241
Sail ho.

613
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,759
She's coming down on us swift as smoke.

614
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,304
Pull alongside, do you hear me?
Pull alongside.

615
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,931
Oh, no. It looks like...

616
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,307
Abashai.

617
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,767
King of all the Jonahs.

618
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:04,605
He's loaded down her cargo
with gin and meanness, as usual.

619
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,112
Been a Jonah all his life.

620
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,448
What's a Jonah?

621
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,826
Anyone, anything that brings bad luck.

622
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,999
Ahoy there!

623
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,646
Can you spare me a hand?

624
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,606
I got a dead one in the focsle.

625
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,734
Need someone livelier.

626
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,154
How about the boy?

627
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,450
Put you on a boat, you said.

628
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,077
Any boat.

629
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,706
Wanna switch? Now's your chance, boy.

630
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,083
Fill in for the dead man.

631
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,588
How about it? Fifteen a month,

632
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,464
and all you can drink.

633
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
Dad, don't.

634
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,176
How about it?

635
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,054
Please, sir. No.

636
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,309
No!

637
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,769
No.

638
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,698
Please.

639
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,658
How about it?

640
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,286
On your way, Abashai.

641
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,667
Better get to your pumps mighty quick.

642
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,504
Immerse you and curse you!

643
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,590
Hoodwink you and sink you!

644
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,967
You're all on your last voyage!

645
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,639
None of you.
You'll never see Gloucester no more!

646
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,182
No more!

647
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,810
There's a fine little floating hell
for you.

648
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,313
I wish he hadn't laid on that curse.

649
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,033
What happened to the ship?

650
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,422
Looks like her boilers burst.

651
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,970
Drunk or sober, we gotta help 'em.

652
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,806
Heave short. Break her out.

653
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:44,890
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Smart.

654
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,517
Heave short, break her out.

655
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,818
No survivors.

656
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,531
All of them drowned.

657
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,577
Never took the time
to tend to their ship.

658
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,372
Drunk beyond all caring.

659
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,999
His own curse boomeranged on him.

660
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,669
He took all his bad luck
to the bottom with him.

661
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,591
Thanks.

662
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,096
Thanks for not putting me on that boat.

663
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,684
Ship.

664
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,522
Dan, you and the boy go in the crosstrees,

665
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,065
and guide us back to the trawl buoys.

666
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,859
Yes, sir.

667
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,768
Do you know what this is?

668
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,356
I've seen you point it at the sun,

669
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,233
then look at that book.

670
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,110
Somehow you know where you are.

671
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,822
It's called a hog yoke.

672
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,367
Fancy name is "sextant."

673
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,120
The book is the <i>Old Farmer's Almanac,</i>

674
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,914
between the two,
I can figure out latitude.

675
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,291
Seems like magic.

676
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,128
My father taught me.

677
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,714
That'd be something to know.

678
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,511
Come closer.

679
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,097
Come on.

680
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,018
Take it in your hand.

681
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,978
Get the feel of it.

682
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,400
A little higher.

683
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,861
Focus it on the sun.

684
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,988
Here.

685
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,073
Like that.

686
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,824
Can you see it?

687
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,909
Yeah.

688
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,911
Now, you wiggle it a little bit.

689
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,329
-Like this?
-Like a baby, yeah.

690
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,997
Till you see the sun on the horizon.

691
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,263
Don't work at it so hard, Harv.

692
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,398
Let her do it,
mostly she'll do the job herself.

693
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,705
Beautiful how the lad takes to it,
isn't it?

694
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,789
Yeah.

695
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,626
Harvey, he so much want to please Captain.

696
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,670
I think he pretend.

697
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,798
Well, that's the way
we all begin, isn't it?

698
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,675
When we're lads,

699
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,720
we make believe
and make believe, until, finally,

700
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,764
we cheat ourselves into being men.

701
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,059
And so on forever.

702
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,562
That's the way of it.

703
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,814
Pretendin'...

704
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,109
Always pretendin'.

705
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,744
Not bad. At least you didn't hit anything.

706
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,040
Though it would break a snake's back
to follow in your wake.

707
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,842
Okay, Jack!

708
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,386
See you in another month!

709
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,573
Not much mail.

710
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,785
Salters.

711
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,788
One for you here. Appears to be a bill.

712
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,539
I don't owe nobody nothing.

713
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:24,002
And, Long Jack,
I think that's meant to be your name.

714
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,046
She's just learning to write.

715
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,714
Now you'll have to learn to read.

716
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,007
I'll give you one.

717
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,676
One from your mother.

718
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,098
And I bought you something.

719
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,724
Belonged to a Frenchman.

720
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,019
Swears it was used to stab
another sailor in a fight.

721
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,355
Thanks, Dad.

722
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,542
If you ever tire of it, Dan,
I'll buy it from you.

723
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,422
I'll never sell it, Harv. Never.

724
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,560
"I put up 18 pints of berry jam.

725
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,479
The blackberries were especially nice
this year.

726
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,149
Dan, I saw Hattie at church Sunday.

727
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,609
She said I was to tell you, 'Hello.'

728
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,196
I hope the catch is good,
and my two men are staying well.

729
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,741
I am fine and keeping busy.

730
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,494
Time passes slow,
and September seems a long ways off.

731
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,913
I miss having dear Beth..."

732
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,093
She, um, sends her love.

733
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,347
Must be lonely for Mom.

734
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,809
I mean, now that Beth...

735
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,311
I know what you mean.

736
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,816
Ever think about taking a job on shore?

737
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,112
I was born to fish.

738
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,823
Your mother always knew that.

739
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,538
Hattie's a lot like Mom, don't you think?

740
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,089
Close enough.

741
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,770
Well, better go relieve Harv at the pumps.

742
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,610
He's shaping up, don't you think?

743
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,694
I do.

744
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,114
When he first came aboard,
he knew all the answers.

745
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,617
He's learning to ask questions.

746
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,592
Maybe I can meet Hattie
when we get to Gloucester.

747
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,677
Maybe.

748
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,346
Do you want to see a picture of her?

749
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,098
Sure.

750
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,984
That's a lock of her hair.

751
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,194
I sure see why you like her.

752
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,154
She's prettier than that.

753
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,241
Guess you'll marry her.

754
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,827
I expect to. Someday.

755
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,497
One day I'm gonna have a fleet
of the new fishing boats.

756
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,791
Haddockers, herring boats.

757
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,919
Dad, he could find the fish,

758
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,255
but he's no way keeping up with the times.

759
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,758
Must cost a lot.

760
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,302
Oh, hills of dollars.

761
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,637
Fifteen thousand, maybe more.

762
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,099
I figured I'll call
the first one<i> Hattie S.</i>

763
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:08,059
But Dad may not take to that.

764
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,394
Him and me'll be partners.

765
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:12,898
Dan,

766
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,861
any chance we might partner?

767
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,407
Well, I don't know.

768
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,326
I mean, I'd like it,

769
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,786
but Dad would have the final say.

770
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,663
Yeah, you're right.

771
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,249
And he wouldn't want me
hanging around either.

772
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,501
He's not an easy man to know.

773
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,254
He puts up with me, but

774
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,049
he doesn't like me.

775
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,887
We'll bring him around, Harv.

776
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,056
We'll work it out.

777
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,265
Yeah.

778
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,539
Here.

779
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,291
This is for you.

780
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,128
No, Dan.

781
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,005
I couldn't.

782
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,300
When's your birthday?

783
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,178
Not till December.

784
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,055
Okay, so...

785
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,475
It's for your birthday,
and for Christmas, and,

786
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,019
just because we're dory mates,
and so on and so on.

787
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,068
Thanks, Dan.

788
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,821
Best present I ever got.

789
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,617
I'll keep it.

790
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,453
As long as I live.

791
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,249
Don't worry, Harv.

792
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,085
Somehow, we'll work together.

793
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,171
Partner.

794
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,883
Partner.

795
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,004
I didn't think you saw it.

796
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,048
I see more than you think.

797
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,510
How do you spell "bachelor"?

798
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,305
Just write,
"I'll never be nobody's husband."

799
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,725
What are you reading?

800
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,393
The <i>Old Farmer's Almanac.</i>

801
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,728
The Captain gave me a lend.

802
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,314
A word with you, lads.

803
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,069
I've decided tomorrow,
we go out before sunrise.

804
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,528
Get a jump on the rest of 'em.

805
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,156
All hands on deck by 3:30.

806
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,908
Aye, aye, sir. Dories down and away.

807
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,204
And, boy, you won't be going
with Dan in the morning.

808
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,874
You'll be going in a dory of your own.

809
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,002
Yes, sir.

810
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,837
Ha-ha! All right.

811
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,589
Get some sleep.

812
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,551
Who can sleep?

813
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,970
A dory of my own.

814
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,266
My own dory.

815
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,936
Way to go, son.

816
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,982
I still can't believe he trusts me
with my own dory.

817
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,527
It's a good sign he sees
some hopes for you.

818
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,154
It's a start.

819
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,990
But he still doesn't call me by name.

820
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,034
Just "boy."

821
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,577
That'll come.

822
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,955
First year was the same thing with me.

823
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,498
Even though I'm his son.

824
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,959
I talked to Dad about the partnership.

825
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,585
The three of us.

826
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,379
Did it make him mad?

827
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,756
Not so you'd notice.

828
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,467
Maybe I shouldn't go to New York.

829
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,594
Maybe I could just stay on in Gloucester,

830
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,471
we could start the partnership right away.

831
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,014
What about school?

832
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,143
Who needs school
when we've got our own ship?

833
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,228
That's not the way Dad sees it.

834
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,647
Him and Ma are set
on me having that diploma.

835
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,525
Yeah.

836
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,153
Which is what worries me.

837
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,655
I go to New York,

838
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,032
you stay in Gloucester.

839
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,702
Year passes.

840
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,413
It's all forgotten.

841
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,249
The partnership, I mean.

842
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,084
I'm not forgetting, Harv.

843
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,878
Is that the kind of friend you think I am?

844
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,047
No, of course I don't.

845
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,634
I'm kind of missing Hattie.

846
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,137
You know the best part about getting home?

847
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,513
A night shirt.

848
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,348
Ma'll have a new one for me.

849
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,058
All washed soft.

850
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,602
Yeah.

851
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,192
Good fishing!

852
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,235
All together, lads.

853
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,778
Stay close to me, Harvey.

854
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,863
That's it.

855
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,037
Men, stay close!

856
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,057
Line squall's coming!

857
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,977
Back aboard!

858
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,603
Up-anchor!

859
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,565
Back to the ship! All aboard!

860
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,817
Go back to the ship, Harv!

861
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,860
Stay close to me!

862
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:41,953
Penn!

863
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:47,208
Penn! Anchor up! Follow me!

864
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,668
Okay!

865
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,735
Help!

866
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,780
Somebody, help!

867
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,744
It's Penn! Cut the roding!

868
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,829
Penn, cut it!

869
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,377
He can't find his knife!

870
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,302
Go back to the ship, Harv!

871
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,012
Please, go back!

872
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:50,063
Harvey! Harvey, go back! It's not safe!

873
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,650
Dan can look after himself!

874
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,612
Somebody, help me!

875
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,905
Hang on, Penn!

876
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,948
I'm on my way!

877
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:02,950
Dan!

878
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,535
I'm here!

879
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,371
Over here!

880
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,254
It's all right. I'll cut it.

881
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,805
I've got it!

882
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,348
-There you go, Penn.
-Go back.

883
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,432
Are you all right?

884
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,601
Thanks, Danny.

885
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,811
Get back to the ship.

886
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,030
Penn!

887
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,450
Help! Help!

888
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:45,993
Penn!

889
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,538
Get in the dory, Penn!

890
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,206
Help!

891
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,709
Help!

892
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,010
Hang on, Penn!
I'm coming for you!

893
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,179
-I'm trying.
-Hang on now!

894
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,724
That's it. Here. Grab this.

895
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,267
Grab it. That's it.

896
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:13,855
Come on, I got you.

897
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,025
Help!

898
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,278
I lost an oar!

899
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:21,904
Ahhh!

900
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,162
Where's Dan?

901
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,375
Dan! Dan!

902
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,961
Dan!

903
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,964
There! Over there!

904
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,808
Dan!

905
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,769
Dan!

906
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:22,423
Dan.

907
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,682
Where's Dan?

908
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,940
When the storm broke, Penn's anchor stuck.

909
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,734
And Dan went to help him.

910
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,091
We sail.

911
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:49,677
Now.

912
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,439
You heard him.

913
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,483
Dories aboard. Hoist the main.

914
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,110
We're under way.

915
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:48,569
Little Penn,

916
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,738
now is the time for a prayer.

917
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,824
A prayer?

918
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,663
Yes.

919
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,792
"Our Father,

920
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,419
Who art in heaven,

921
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,922
hallowed be Thy name.

922
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,008
Thy kingdom come,

923
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,052
Thy...

924
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,721
Thy will be...

925
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,348
done."

926
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,070
"And Thy will be done, on earth

927
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,240
as it is in heaven.

928
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,910
Give us this day..."

929
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,453
"...our daily bread,

930
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,623
and forgive us our debts,

931
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,334
as we forgive our debtors."

932
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,294
Morning coffee, sir.

933
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:11,462
Go away.

934
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:12,588
Go away!

935
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:13,881
But, sir...

936
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:15,549
How dare you?

937
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,676
-You think you can take Dan's place?
-It wasn't that, sir.

938
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,595
I should have left you where I found you!

939
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,223
You damned Jonah!

940
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,890
Bad luck!

941
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,185
Nothing but bad luck
since you first come aboard!

942
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,770
Go away! Go away!

943
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,330
Where's the lad?

944
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,421
Boy.

945
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,051
Cover your head.

946
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:22,903
Thank you.

947
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:25,948
You're welcome, sir.

948
01:11:28,742 --> 01:11:29,743
Harvey.

949
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,290
Yes, sir?

950
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,917
Tomorrow morning,

951
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,462
half a teaspoon less sugar.

952
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,507
Yes, sir.

953
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,010
Wait a bit.

954
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:51,348
We're approaching land.

955
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,767
We need to make some plans for you.

956
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,436
Yes, sir.

957
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,896
When we get to the dock, I'll...

958
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,816
get a telegram off
to that legal firm in New York.

959
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,361
I would guess they'll send someone
to fetch you.

960
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,947
Yeah. Arthur Wade, I expect.

961
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,616
If he hasn't been fired or quit.

962
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,788
Long Jack says there's a boarding house
where the crew stays.

963
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:18,834
I, uh... I guess I'll stay there
till he comes.

964
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,673
I imagine you'll be going off to school.

965
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,175
Yeah.

966
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,762
Some boarding school somewhere.

967
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,932
You've got a good mind.

968
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,436
Learn to make the best use of it.

969
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,272
Yes, sir.

970
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,742
How will you tell Mrs. Troop,

971
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,328
about Dan?

972
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,044
She'll know.

973
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,769
We lost him, Mary Ann.

974
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,859
So...

975
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,529
You wanna come with us?

976
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,571
Harvey, is it?

977
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,490
Yes, ma'am.

978
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:43,932
Harvey is coming home with us.

979
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,806
I baked a gingerbread this morning.

980
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,145
Dan could never get enough gingerbread
with butterscotch icing.

981
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,523
Is anyone hungry?

982
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,192
No, thank you.

983
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,153
The boy's frazzled.

984
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,450
It's been a lot of hours
since he hauled out this morning.

985
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:46,578
Of course.

986
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:00,008
Just come with me.

987
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,667
Here you are.

988
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:00,902
So...

989
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,323
You got to know Danny, then, did you?

990
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:07,492
Yeah.

991
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:12,122
He was the best friend I ever had.

992
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,131
Sleep well.

993
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,775
The Cheyne Trust, of course,

994
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:25,529
can never hope to adequately repay you
for what you have done.

995
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,406
Saving Harvey, caring for him,

996
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,492
and bringing him back safely to us.

997
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,245
But we would like to show our gratitude

998
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,872
with a token of,

999
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:40,043
say, $10,000?

1000
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,046
No.

1001
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:50,220
Twenty thousand
would be a more appropriate sum.

1002
01:20:58,311 --> 01:20:59,312
Harvey?

1003
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,902
What's happened to you?

1004
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,782
Been working for my living as a fisherman.

1005
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,579
Which reminds me, I owe you your wages.

1006
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,876
Three months at ten and a half,
that's $31.50.

1007
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,336
There we are.

1008
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:32,971
And $0.50.

1009
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:38,643
Thank you.

1010
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,230
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1011
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,991
Why didn't you tell Captain Troop
who you were?

1012
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:57,162
I tried, but he thought I was crazy.

1013
01:21:58,121 --> 01:21:59,205
Also, um...

1014
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,168
I'm afraid I called him a thief
when I couldn't find my wallet.

1015
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:07,464
That didn't get me off
to a very good start.

1016
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,549
No, I don't imagine it did.

1017
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:13,303
But the Captain's son, Dan,

1018
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:14,804
spoke up for me.

1019
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,265
So, I was offered ten and a half a month.

1020
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:21,019
It was work or I don't eat.

1021
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,607
I worked.

1022
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,192
You worked?

1023
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:30,445
Doing what?

1024
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,240
Well, I can handle a dory
almost as well as Dan,

1025
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:36,576
and I don't get rattled in fog...

1026
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,078
much.

1027
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,829
I can steer in light winds,

1028
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,706
and I can bait up a trawl.

1029
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,626
Well,

1030
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,629
Dan, you know,

1031
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:49,839
taught me the most.

1032
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,509
And will I meet Dan?

1033
01:22:56,763 --> 01:23:00,350
He drowned saving another crewman.

1034
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,065
I want to do everything I can
for the Captain,

1035
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,901
and every man on that crew.

1036
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:12,445
Of course.

1037
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,575
I want to build a hospital. Here.

1038
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,703
A hospital?

1039
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,998
Dan's sister died of a ruptured appendix

1040
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,083
because there was no hospital.

1041
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,712
So, I want to build one.

1042
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,715
In memory of her and Dan.

1043
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,345
Yes.

1044
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,392
We can do all of that from New York.

1045
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:44,811
The limousine's waiting.

1046
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,484
There's... something important
I have to do first.

1047
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,502
We are here this morning to honor
the memory of those brave men of the sea,

1048
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,214
who, in the year past, gave their lives

1049
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,759
in pursuit of the calling
that supports most of us.

1050
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,470
I will read their names
in chronological order.

1051
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,265
Schooner <i>Florrie Anderson.</i>

1052
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,810
Lost with all aboard off the Georges.

1053
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:31,608
Reuben Pitman, master, 50, single, City.

1054
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,070
Schooner <i>Gilbert Hope.</i>

1055
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:36,780
Robert Bevin...

1056
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,531
<i>Don't worry, Harv.</i>

1057
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,868
<i>Somehow, we'll work together.</i>

1058
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:45,455
<i>One day I'm gonna have a fleet</i>
<i>of the new fishing boats.</i>

1059
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:47,499
<i>Haddockers, herring boats.</i>

1060
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,251
<i>I figured I'll call</i>
<i>the first one</i> Hattie S.

1061
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,841
<i>Here.</i>

1062
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:58,384
This is for you.

1063
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:00,428
Thanks, Dan.

1064
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,722
Best present I ever got.

1065
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,142
Partner?

1066
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:09,771
Partner.

1067
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,398
Schooner <i>We're Here.</i>

1068
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:17,821
Dan Troop, 16, single.

1069
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:22,700
Drowned when his dory,
the <i>Hattie S</i> capsized

1070
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,745
during successful rescue
of a fellow crewman.

1071
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,425
Schooner <i>Marie Douglas.</i>

1072
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,929
Mark Kelly, single...

1073
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:47,392
Harvey.

1074
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:49,727
Mr. Wade.

1075
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,889
I couldn't get my breath.

1076
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,309
Same here.

1077
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:33,146
All those names.

1078
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,647
That bell.

1079
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,151
I kept hearing Dan's voice.

1080
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:50,663
Harvey...

1081
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:55,210
What you're planning to do
about the hospital,

1082
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,422
it means a lot to Mrs. Troop...

1083
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,593
and me.

1084
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,763
You and Dan did so much for me.

1085
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,141
Made me feel like I had a family.

1086
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:13,394
I know you two talked a lot.

1087
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,980
Had some big plans, he said.

1088
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:22,987
He wanted this fleet of fishing boats.

1089
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,031
Partners with you.

1090
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,327
"Dad knows fish," he said,

1091
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,746
but he don't keep up with the times."

1092
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:35,583
He said that, did he?

1093
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:38,628
He had it right.

1094
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,714
And...

1095
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,593
I sort of hoped I'd be part of it one day.

1096
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,139
Troop and Cheyne,
I do like the sound of that, but...

1097
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,058
We could be partners? Together?

1098
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,269
I'll call Wade.
We can start the boats right away.

1099
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,938
Hold up. Hold up.
You're running on hurricane wind here.

1100
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:02,026
First for you,
it's back and finish school,

1101
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,946
the same as it would have been for Dan.

1102
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:08,324
Get the best education you can,

1103
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,786
because you're gonna have
some mighty big responsibilities.

1104
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,497
And to make sure you are doing your best,

1105
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:17,417
I expect a copy of your report card
sent to me regular.

1106
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,295
Boys need to know that somebody's
keeping close watch.

1107
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,173
How does that sound to you?

1108
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:25,758
Well...

1109
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:28,386
I wish I could skip school,

1110
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:32,932
but I've gotten used to doing as you say.

1111
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:37,770
Cheyne and Troop.

1112
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:41,607
Troop and Cheyne.

1113
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:09,844
So, is good I see you drifting
and haul you in, yeah?

1114
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:11,137
Yeah.

1115
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:13,056
Manuel,

1116
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:16,059
tell your little girl in Madeira
to stop crying.

1117
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,603
There's already too much saltwater
out there.

1118
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:26,527
How am I gonna live
without your fried pies?

1119
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:29,655
You will eat many more of them.

1120
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,219
When you're doin' all this learnin',

1121
01:29:51,844 --> 01:29:53,846
learn some respect for farmers,

1122
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,307
the real salt of the earth.

1123
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:00,061
I'll put my shoulder to the plow,
Uncle Salters.

1124
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:09,946
Get outta here before I gives you one.

1125
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:19,664
You take good care of yourself.

1126
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:22,583
I'll see you next summer.

1127
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:39,058
Thank you.
