1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,400
Welcome to the strange and
wonderful world of illusions.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,840
Baa. Baa. Baa.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,800
Illusions to deceive your eyes.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,680
So I do take cheques.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,160
Trick your tongue.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,160
And fool your sense of touch.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Oh!

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,400
But don't worry, it's all in the
name of a noble scientific quest.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,000
These illusions hold the key
to how our senses work.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,240
When you open your eyes
in the morning,

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,920
most people think,
"I'm seeing the world as it is".

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,960
The beautiful thing about illusions
is they tell us that that's not true.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,240
They show us that our perceptions
of the world are something different

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,080
from seeing it as it really is.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,880
Illusions are providing a
unique window into the
inner workings of our minds.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,920
Helping to reveal what our sensory
brains are really capable of.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,480
So this is a golden age
in perceptual psychology.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,120
The things we've learned over
the last ten years have been
absolutely phenomenal.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,240
These new discoveries are opening
up a whole new world of possibility.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,600
Even enabling us to move beyond
our sensory evolution altogether.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,880
So watch, play along,
and prepare to be amazed at
what your senses can do.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Can you trust
anything you see with your eyes?

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,560
Do you think seeing is
really believing?

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,080
The beautiful thing about illusions
is that they make us realise

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,000
things are not
always quite as they seem.

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,480
So the question for you is,
you see the surface here
and the surface there?

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,320
Right? Do they look
the same in terms of their colour.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,600
That's what you see,
they look different.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,440
What if I told you that they're
actually the same.
Will you put money on it?

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Would you bet your life on it?

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,560
You wouldn't be standing here,
would you?!

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,720
Do they look the same now?
That's mad, ain't it? It looks it.

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
Are they the same physically?

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,040
To our amazement and delight,
illusions are so powerful

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,920
that even when we know how
they work we can still be fooled.

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,800
But for scientists like
Dr Beau Lotto, they are far
more than fun and games.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Now, how many people see
four blue tiles on the left?

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,960
Yes? I see four blue.
How many people see
seven yellow tiles on the right?

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,040
I see seven yellow.

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,480
What if I told you they're all grey?

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,160
So if I take, for instance,
this tile, what colour is it now?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,520
Grey.

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,320
If I move it over here,

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,240
what colour is it now?

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
Yellowish grey.

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
So those tiles
are all physically the same.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,720
Illusions are crucial tools that
reveal how the world out there

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
can be very different
to the one in our heads.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:42,360
And it's this gap between reality
and what we perceive that holds
the key to how our senses work.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,440
So if you're unsure if seeing
is really believing,
you're not the only one.

51
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,520
Is seeing believing?

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,760
What do you mean by that?

53
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,200
Is seeing believing?

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,840
Is seeing believing?

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
No.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Yes.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,760
I think it depends who you ask.

58
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,960
Seeing is literally believing.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
We see what we believe.

60
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,080
So, yes.

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,120
So it's this question of whether
seeing really is believing that's

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,400
helping scientists to open up the
fascinating world inside our heads.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,880
And one of the places they are
turning to for inspiration
is an ancient and untapped source.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,960
Magic Singh is a master of illusion.

65
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,200
His livelihood depends
on his ability to confuse,
trick and deceive.

66
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,960
It's something magicians like him
have been doing for millennia.

67
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,600
But now scientists
want in on the act.

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
Magicians have developed

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,440
really powerful ways of
manipulating what we see.

70
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,600
And many of these techniques
have been tried and tested
in front of live audiences.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,240
So by doing so, magicians have
sort of developed

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,080
a very solid understanding
of how we see the world.

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,760
Psychologist Gustav Kuhn is well
versed in the language of illusion.

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,160
In a former life,
he was a professional magician.

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,560
Today he's swapped the
magic circuit for the science lab,

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,840
but he's convinced
there are some important lessons

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,800
to be learnt from plundering
the magician's book of tricks.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,800
So actually take the card out.

79
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,960
We're really interested
in the magic tricks per se,

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,000
but what we focus on is
the techniques that magicians
use to manipulate your perception.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,200
OK, I'm not going to put the
eye-tracker on you, so if you could
just wear these glasses.

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,520
In order to find out how
these illusions work,
Gustav Kuhn has developed

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,320
an eye-tracking experiment

84
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,720
to enable him to find out
what's happening
when we watch certain tricks.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Now in the vanishing ball illusion,
the magician tosses the ball up
a couple of times and then on the

86
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,720
final throw, he just pretends to
toss the ball up in the air.

87
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,040
Yet most people actually
experience an imaginary ball

88
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,200
leave the hand and then sort of
disappear somewhere up there.

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,880
But when Gustav analysed his data,

90
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,040
he discovered the eyes
and the brain
told a very different story.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,280
Now, the eye-tracking data
showed us that whilst most people
were fooled by the illusion,

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,240
the eyes weren't tricked.

93
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,880
So the eyes, rather than actually
looking at the imaginary ball,
just stayed on the face.

94
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,480
And what this showed us is that
the illusion really happened
in people's minds.

95
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,920
What this trick really demonstrates
is that, rather than
seeing what's physically present,

96
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,320
the way we see the world is
based on our prediction of the world.

97
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,360
So we see things that we expect to
see, so in this case,

98
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,120
we expect the ball to
leave the hand, and that's why

99
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,560
we actually see the ball,
even though physically
it's not actually present.

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,800
When it comes to what we see,
the brain often overrules the eyes,

101
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
even constructing events that
may not have actually happened.

102
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,320
It's an important insight into how
our visual system operates
in the real world.

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,440
In the real world things happen
incredibly quickly and we have to

104
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,560
respond at great speed and accuracy
to visual information.

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,120
This information processing may take
up to 150 milliseconds,

106
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,400
and that kind of delay would just
be far too great for us to miss,

107
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,840
for example,
catching a ball or so.

108
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,720
So rather than just relying
on this information,
what the visual system does,

109
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,960
is it predicts what's
going to be happening in the future.

110
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,200
So in many ways, what we see
is what's going to happen in the
future rather than in the present.

111
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,760
So seeing may not
always be believing.

112
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,360
But is our sense of
hearing any more reliable?

113
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,680
At any one moment, we are being
bombarded by sensory information.

114
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,760
Our brains do a remarkable
job of making sense of it all.

115
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,400
It seems easy enough to
separate the sounds we hear

116
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
from the sights we see.

117
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,400
But there is one illusion that
reveals this isn't always the case.

118
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,600
Baa, baa, baa.

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,040
Have a look at this.
What do you hear?

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
Baa, baa, baa.

121
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,280
Baa, baa, baa.

122
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,920
But look what happens
when we change the picture.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,560
Faa, faa, faa.

124
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,440
Faa, faa, faa.

125
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,560
Faa, faa...
And yet the sound hasn't changed.

126
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,680
In every clip, you are
only ever hearing "Baa", with a B.

127
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,600
Baa, baa, baa.

128
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,520
Baa...

129
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,360
It's an illusion known
as the McGurk effect.

130
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,400
Take another look.

131
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,120
Baa, baa... Concentrate first
on the right of the screen.

132
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Now to the left of the screen.

133
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,040
Baa, baa... The illusions occurs
because what you are seeing clashes
with what you are hearing.

134
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,520
In the illusion,
what we see overrides what we hear,

135
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,560
so the mouth movements we see
as we look at a face

136
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,040
can actually influence
what we believe we're hearing.

137
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,240
If we close our eyes,
we actually hear the sound as it is.

138
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,240
If we open our eyes, we actually see
how the mouth movements can
influence what we're hearing.

139
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
Baa, baa, baa.

140
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,680
It's a bizarre effect.

141
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Remember, the only sound
you're hearing is "Baa", with a B.

142
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,480
Faa, faa, faa.

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,560
Baa, baa, baa.

144
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,720
What's remarkable about
this illusions is

145
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,160
even knowing how it's done doesn't
seem to make a difference.

146
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,840
The effect works no matter how
much you know about the effect.

147
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,640
I've been studying the
McGurk effect for 25 years,

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
and I've been the face
in the stimuli,

149
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,280
I've seen stimuli thousands
and thousands of times,
but the effect still works on me.

150
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,320
I can't help it, the speech brain
takes in that information

151
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
and doesn't care about what outside
knowledge you bring to bear.

152
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,560
Baa, baa, baa.

153
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,560
The McGurk effect shows us
that what we hear
may not always be the truth.

154
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,760
It also helps us to understand what
happens when our senses conflict.

155
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Baa, baa, baa.

156
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
When the brain
has the conflicting information,

157
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,320
it tries to make sense
of that conflict,

158
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,640
and depending on what type of
modality is providing more, I guess,
salient information,

159
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,080
that information
might override or at least combine
with the other information.

160
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,920
So we can't always trust what
we hear because sometimes
our sense of vision takes over,

161
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,480
enabling us to maintain
a coherent view of the world.

162
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,280
But why do illusions
have such power?

163
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,360
Scientist are finding answers
in the most surprising of places.

164
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,680
For bees, colour
is a matter of life and death.

165
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,320
They need to
distinguish between colours
to find the source of their food.

166
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,760
And the way bees learn this
important lesson can offer us
insights into how we perceive.

167
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,200
One of the great things about
studying bees is that bees see
colour much the way that we see it.

168
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,800
They see the same illusions
that we see, yet they do it with
only a million brain cells.

169
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,960
Which means that we can actually
study how bumble bees see

170
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,120
and in doing so
we can understand how we see.

171
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,360
Dr Beau Lotto has devised a unique
experiment known as the bee matrix,

172
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,480
where he uses 64 coloured lights
to represent flowers.

173
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,400
The aim of the game
is to find the sugar reward.

174
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,920
We are training the bees
to go to blue flowers,
as opposed to purple flowers,

175
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,720
and the way we do that is we reward
only the blue flowers,

176
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,920
reward being sugar water,
and we don't put any reward
into the purple flowers.

177
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,440
So if they land on a blue flower,
they get a reward.

178
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,600
And then they associate
that with the colour.

179
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,600
In the top part of the array we have
blue flowers surrounded by white
flowers, in the bottom part of

180
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,040
the array we have purple flowers
also surrounded by white flowers.

181
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,160
Only the blue flowers
have a sugar reward.

182
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,760
At first, the bees quickly find
their reward by learning the
difference between the colours.

183
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,720
But then things
are made more difficult.

184
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:21,280
Using filters, Beau changes the
colours, so now the blue and purple
flowers look exactly the same.

185
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,760
But remarkably, the bees still
fly straight to to the reward.

186
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,640
So as far as the bee's
eye is concerned,
those are exactly the same.

187
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,600
If the bees only remembered
the colour of the stimulus,

188
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,120
they should go to both,
because they're physically the same.

189
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,400
If, however, they've remembered
the blue flowers in a context

190
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,920
and used that context, they
should now go only go to the top.

191
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,160
What we've shown is that that's
exactly what happens, which means
they are using the context.

192
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,720
They have remembered and learned
the relationships between
the colours to solve the puzzle.

193
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,160
So, to solve the puzzle,
the bees don't just look at
the colours in the middle

194
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,600
they also look at
the colours that surround them.

195
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,880
And it's by comparing the central
colours to those on the outside

196
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,800
that they are able to detect
the true colour.

197
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,680
It shows that, for bees, colour
isn't just seen in isolation,

198
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,040
it's entirely dependent
on the environment in which
it's perceived.

199
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,600
And what applies to bees
also applies to us,
every day of our lives.

200
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,040
Here we have two cubes,
except in this case

201
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,760
it looks as if the cube on the left
is under yellow light,

202
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,840
and the cube on the right
is under blue light.

203
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,920
On the left we have four
blue tiles, and on the right
we have seven yellow tiles.

204
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,080
What's amazing about this illusion

205
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,960
is that the blue tiles on the left
are exactly the same, physically,

206
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,400
as the yellow tiles on the right.

207
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,840
They're all in fact grey.

208
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,440
So in this instance
the brain has created colours
that simply aren't there.

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,400
When the other colours are stripped
away, we can see the blue and
yellow tiles are just grey.

210
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,000
Put the scene back, and the colours
change back to yellow and blue.

211
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,600
It shows that, in spite of our
strongest instincts, colour
is a purely subjective experience,

212
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,080
governed by the context
in which we see it.

213
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,400
Redness is not a
product of the world.

214
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,680
It doesn't exist unless
we're there to make it.

215
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,840
Blueness is not a part of the world,
wavelengths are not colour.

216
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,120
All they are is little packets
of energy called photons,
they are not colour.

217
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,080
We take that and we make
perceptions of them, and those
perceptions guide our behaviour.

218
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,200
Illusions fool us
because, try as we might,

219
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,600
we cannot overcome our experience
of how we think the world works.

220
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,400
It's these experiences we
store in our heads that really
determines what we see.

221
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,680
What's amazing is that that
information, coming from the eyes

222
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,360
through the thalamus
to the back part of the brain,

223
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,280
actually only makes up 10% of the
overall information we use to see.

224
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,880
The rest of the information comes
from other parts of the brain.

225
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Only 10% of the information we
use to see comes from the eyes.

226
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,720
But are these experiences
only built up in the course
of our own lives,

227
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
or are some illusions so powerful

228
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,440
their roots lie
far in our distant past?

229
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,640
Janine Spencer and husband Justin
O'Brien are hoping to find out

230
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,280
if seeing certain illusions is
learnt in the course of our lives

231
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,360
or hard-wired from birth.

232
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,800
It requires several babies,
and a great deal of patience.

233
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,720
Anybody who studies with babies
will know they're
notoriously difficult,

234
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,600
not because they're hard
in themselves, they're lovely,

235
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I love having babies in the lab,
but we can't ask them anything.

236
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,240
There is a number of reasons
why it takes such a
long time to get baby data,

237
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
pretty normal reasons.

238
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,200
They cry, they get hungry, they
don't like what they're looking at,

239
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,040
they want to move, they don't
want to sit in their car seat,

240
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,960
so there are a number of reasons
and because of that,

241
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
we have to test lots of
babies to get enough data.

242
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
BABIES CRY

243
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,000
In order to find out they are using
a famous piece of visual trickery

244
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,920
called the hollow mask illusion.

245
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,160
One side of the mask is hollow,
but it doesn't necessarily
look that way.

246
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,880
Even when we know it's an illusion,
we see it as the convex face.

247
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,840
Even when we know it's hollow
our visual system sees it,
we interpret it, as being convex.

248
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,520
Essentially, our knowledge
of faces is overriding what our
visual system can see,

249
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,960
so our depth perception
can see that it's hollow,

250
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,320
but our visual system is
overriding that and saying, "no".

251
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
Not in those words,

252
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,240
it's unconscious
of course, but that's a face,
so it must be sticking out.

253
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,600
They've been testing the hollow
mask illusion on babies at
just four and a half months of age.

254
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
I think it's important to study
babies to look at visual illusions

255
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,920
and any phenomenon where you want
to find out if it's innate or not,

256
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,120
because they don't
have that kind of experience
we would get as adults.

257
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,000
The younger you can test them,
the better it is.

258
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,280
It's known babies
are good at recognising
faces, but the question is,

259
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,800
do they still see a face
when they look at the hollow side
of the mask?

260
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,960
By carefully monitoring their eye
movements, it's possible to detect
if the babies see the illusion

261
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,160
by the way the mask
captures their attention.

262
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,960
We measure the amount of interest
the baby has in the experiment
by looking at their eyes.

263
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,560
We monitor their eye movements
and we time how long they look,

264
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,680
and when we get to a certain level
where they're not looking
very much at all,

265
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,760
we know they're
bored of the experiment.

266
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,480
It's still early days,
but 50 babies later
a pattern is beginning to emerge.

267
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,240
From the data we have so far,
it would suggest that
babies can see the illusion,

268
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,600
giving an indication that face
perception is an innate ability.

269
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,160
If this pattern continues,
it will be the first significant
evidence to suggest that seeing

270
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,840
certain illusions is so powerful
it's an ability we've
inherited from our parents.

271
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,440
What's exciting for us about the
results we're finding at the moment

272
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,520
is that it doesn't just tell us
about the way babies see, it tells
us about our evolutionary past.

273
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,640
The experience of our ancestors
of seeing faces and them
being so necessary for survival

274
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,480
is now written into our DNA,
so when a baby's born,

275
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,160
the first thing they'll look at
and show interest in is a face.

276
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,320
The hollow mask illusion helps
explain why seeing illusions may
have come about in the first place.

277
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,480
We've learnt to see what best
aids our chances of survival.

278
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,040
In our evolutionary past,
it's important to see faces

279
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,160
because they could be our enemy.

280
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,760
It's also not just human faces,
it's animal faces as well,

281
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
so we're very good
at seeing animal faces.

282
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,840
So something staring at you
through the trees could be a tiger,

283
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,320
so it's important you interpret
something as being a face.

284
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,440
If it turns out to be a pattern
of leaves in the sunlight,
you haven't lost anything.

285
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,000
If you ignore it and it really
was a face, then you're in trouble.

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,280
For Janine and Justin,

287
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,200
over five years of infinite
patience is finally paying off.

288
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes, very pleased, we need more
babies but we're very pleased
with the results we have so far.

289
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,440
It's only taken five and a half
years but we're nearly there.

290
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Illusions show us that we
literally see the world through
the lens of the past,

291
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,520
learning to see in
the way that's most useful to us.

292
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,880
It's an ability that's so important

293
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,000
it's been handed down through the
generations for thousands of years.

294
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,960
So if you thought being tricked
by illusions was a weakness,
then think again.

295
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:57,040
They may seem to be just a
bit of fun, but it turns out
they may be the key to our success.

296
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,040
So what if I told you
they're exactly the same?

297
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,200
Oh, my God.
So, I do take cheques.

298
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,600
You just lost so much money!

299
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,760
Many people think that illusions
in fact demonstrate the fragility

300
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
of the human senses, which is
in fact completely rubbish.

301
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,360
Illusions don't tell us
that our senses are fragile.

302
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,880
If they were, we wouldn't be here.
Illusions tell us that actually,

303
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,880
our brains are incredibly
capable of constructing meaning

304
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,440
from the meaningless.
We're really good at doing that.

305
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,800
If we were to
process all of the information

306
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,320
that we feel that we're aware of,

307
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,720
we would have to grow huge brains

308
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,920
and have massive heads that our
bodies would just fail to support.

309
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,600
Rather than using this approach,
we've evolved to, I think,

310
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,760
a very clever attentional system
that only processes the information
that is actually needed.

311
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,160
So, far from being a disadvantage,

312
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,480
illusions are a necessary
and powerful shortcut

313
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,960
that lie at the heart of our most
sophisticated human abilities.

314
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,480
And yet the insights we can get
from illusions don't end there.

315
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,240
Scientists are now realising that
illusions get even more fascinating

316
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,360
when the senses start
to work together.

317
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,000
One of the things most of us
can hold on to is that our
five senses work separately.

318
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,240
We see with our eyes,
hear with our ears,

319
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,240
taste with our tongue
and touch with our skin.

320
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,680
But scientists have been studying
a group of people

321
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,600
for whom this just isn't the case.

322
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,440
So when I hear the sea,

323
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,560
the big clunkiness,
as it were of the wave,

324
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,720
has a kind of dark, dark blue.

325
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,560
And the pebbley bit has
kind of oranges and yellows

326
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,720
and little bits of white.

327
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,000
I heard the wind earlier and
it had these kind of long shapes,

328
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,720
a bit like,
you know, mackerel fillets.

329
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,200
You know those shapes, but a bit...
The little thin ones.

330
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,120
Like that, but blue, and
quite a lot of them going across.

331
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,080
I have synaesthesia,

332
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,120
which means when
I experience taste, smell, sound,

333
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
I get visual images.

334
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,320
Shape, colour and texture
to accompany the sense.

335
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,440
Synaesthesia is a
mixing of the senses.

336
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,080
A sensory experience in one sense
can trigger an entirely
different reaction in another.

337
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,880
Whenever Philippa hears,
smells, or tastes something,
she also sees colours and shapes.

338
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,440
If I was to have fish and chips,
the fish -

339
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,800
the crispiness, that's angular
and then the actually taste

340
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,440
of the fish is kind of
speckeldy brown.

341
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,080
Nice brown, but yeah,
kind of coffee-coloured brown.

342
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,720
While this experience
isn't always pleasurable,

343
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,720
it's helped drive
Philippa's artistic creativity.

344
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,640
This is a painting of
the taste of English mustard.

345
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,840
It has such a distinctive
colour as it is as a product,

346
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,200
it's bright yellow,
but when you taste it, to me,

347
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:07,080
it has this massive red hit,
which then just
disappears into something else

348
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,760
that ends up, by the time
the kind of fumes of it

349
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,800
are going up through your nose,
it's actually quite...pretty.

350
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:22,720
So it starts off as a big,
massive red hit of taste, which then
disperses into something else.

351
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,000
For years, synaesthesia
wasn't taken seriously...

352
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,760
but now scientists are
realising that people like Philippa

353
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,480
provide important clues
as to the way all our senses work.

354
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,680
We're going to present you with
letters and numbers.

355
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,080
They're, um, going to be
coloured either red or green.

356
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,480
Dr Noam Sagiv has spent his
career studying synaesthetes

357
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,520
in an attempt to understand
how their brains are connected.

358
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,160
So scientists have suspected

359
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,200
for a long time that what causes
synaesthesia is extra connections

360
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,280
between different parts of the
brain, particularly between the
sensory areas that are involved.

361
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,760
For example, if someone has
auditory-visual synaesthesia,

362
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,640
we expect that the auditory part
of the brain and the visual part
of the brain would be cross-wired.

363
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,360
And this understanding of how
their brains are wired has led to

364
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,040
an exciting new idea about the way
all our senses develop from birth.

365
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,600
OK?

366
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
That's it. I got one wrong.

367
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:46,480
What we do know is that the brains
of newborns are actually a lot more
connected than the brains of adults.

368
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,520
We start our lives with a
lot of connections in our brains
and we lose some of them.

369
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,360
One of the ideas that
is trying explain the difference

370
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,640
between synaesthetes'
and non-synaesthetes' development

371
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,800
is that essentially,
synaesthetes were able to keep

372
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,040
a little bit more of those
many connections that we
all started our lives with.

373
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:18,160
So this condition might have been
something we've all had at one
time in our lives, but since lost.

374
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,000
But the similarities between
synaesthetes and the rest of us
may not end there.

375
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,480
Scientists are now beginning
to suspect that even as adults,

376
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,960
we may have far more in common
with synaesthetes than we realise.

377
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,280
I can't imagine what it
would be like to be alive

378
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,760
without it...

379
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,760
because it
doesn't impose itself,
it's just part of my being.

380
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,200
So I...

381
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,120
kind of don't believe that

382
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,240
people don't have it.

383
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,560
I think they're just
not looking hard enough.

384
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,120
And this question of the
way our senses are connected

385
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,960
is being answered with the help
of another set of bizarre illusions.

386
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,320
Neuroscientist Charles Spence has
recruited some willing volunteers
for an unusual multi-sensory feast.

387
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,560
He's taken his science out of the
lab and is going to attempt to trick

388
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,360
a group of trainee chefs,
who rely on their senses
more than most of us.

389
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:45,840
OK. You've got four coloured drinks
in front of you and what I want
you to do is to taste each one

390
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,680
and try and figure out
what the flavour is.

391
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,880
The colours and flavours of
the drinks have been mismatched,

392
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,600
resulting
in a certain degree of confusion.

393
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,960
Just looking at some of the
expressions on their faces, you
can see confusion and puzzlement.

394
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,880
One of the people thinks that
the yellow drink is apple.

395
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
It was actually strawberry.

396
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,720
And the red one, they smell like
berries, but in fact was lemon.

397
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,640
I think the green one tasted
more of lime.

398
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,240
Like lime cordial or something
like that, rather than mint.

399
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,920
OK. Excellent.

400
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,200
Green lime, so it's completely
lost the peppermint flavour

401
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,880
and it's being completely driven by
the eyes. The light green actually

402
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,440
reminded me of green washing-up
liquid rather than mint.

403
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,880
Lady's convinced it's
washing-up liquid smell.

404
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,320
And that expectation and knowledge
that comes

405
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,360
from names, from labels, from
colours, from textures,

406
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,400
from ways of presentation,
our brains use that all the time

407
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,160
to tell us what the flavour is.

408
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,120
People will talk about you eat
with your eyes, which is probably
much more true than we realise.

409
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,800
So it's impossible to separate
what we see from what we taste.

410
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,680
But what may be even more surprising
is that when it comes
to what you eat,

411
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,440
your ears may be just as important.

412
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,200
CRUNCHING

413
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,120
This time the chefs
are eating crisps,

414
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,760
but they are also hearing the sound
of their own crunch via headphones.

415
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,360
But what they don't realise is the
noises they hear have been changed.

416
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,400
When they hear low frequencies, they
are tricked into thinking the crisps

417
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,480
are significantly less crunchy than
when they hear higher frequencies.

418
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,160
When anyone thinks about
flavour, the first sense they
think about is taste.

419
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,360
To think about it a bit more,
some people say, "Well I
suppose smell's involved, too."

420
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,640
Then they start, possibly if pushed
they'll say, "Well maybe colour's
got something to do with it."

421
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,200
And finally a bit of texture.

422
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,440
Is it soft and slimy
or crispy or crunchy?

423
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,440
But virtually no-one
ever thinks about sound.

424
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,480
The results show hearing can have
a significant effect on taste.

425
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,600
Just playing higher frequencies
makes people believe crisps
to be over 15% crispier.

426
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,760
But all this culinary trickery
has even more insights to offer.

427
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,480
The reason these tricks work
is because it's impossible to
separate one sense from another.

428
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,480
It's experiments like these
that have enabled scientists

429
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,360
to piece together a revolutionary
new understanding of the brain.

430
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,520
The traditional view was that
you had five senses on the outside,

431
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,120
and the eyes are connected to one bit
of the brain, your ears are connected
to a different part,

432
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,600
your skin to somewhere else.

433
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,400
Each sense had its own bit of brain.

434
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,080
What we find now is in fact, the eye
is talking to the ear almost as soon

435
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,520
as those signals get from the
eye and the ear into the brain.

436
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,320
From very early on, there are
multisensory interactions at work.

437
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,400
Scientists are saying there is
no such thing as a visual brain,

438
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
no such part of the brain
that is just doing hearing.

439
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,880
All of the brain is multisensory,
all of the brain is combining all
the different senses, all the time.

440
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,240
So it turns out we are all far
more similar to synaesthetes
than we've realised.

441
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,360
It's clear we should no longer
think of our senses

442
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,560
as working independently
but as working together as one.

443
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,600
It's a discovery that has truly
revolutionary possibilities.

444
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,320
Hi. I'm Larry. Hi, Edie.

445
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,280
Very nice to meet you. We're going
to do little demonstration here
called the rubber hand illusion.

446
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,320
This illusion may look like
fairground fun, but it reveals

447
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,200
one of the most important
new ideas in brain science.

448
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,840
Right there.

449
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,520
Good. Can you put this hand down
right over here, and curl it up
like the rubber hand is curled up

450
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,520
a little bit. I'm going to try
to position the rubber hand
so it looks like it's your own.

451
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,720
Could you imagine that
being your own hand? Yeah.

452
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,240
We're going to stroke your finger
simultaneously, the rubber
finger and your real finger.

453
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,440
Hopefully this will convince you
that the rubber hand is your own.
Your brain will adopt this hand.

454
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,840
In the illusion, simply watching the
rubber hand being stroked at the

455
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:59,200
same time as the real hand is enough
to trick the brain into adopting it
as its own. We like weird!

456
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,400
And slowly but surely, you should
feel that the hand you're looking at
is actually part of your body.

457
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,280
It feels like you're
touching my hand with that one.

458
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,640
Right, so it feels like this is
your hand I'm touching, right?

459
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,800
Are you OK? Yeah. Good.

460
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,520
Try that at home with your kids!

461
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,880
The rubber hand illusion
is a wonderful example of how

462
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,760
multisensory perception can influence
how we perceive our own body.

463
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,080
That's how deep
multisensory perception runs.

464
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,680
When you hold your hand out, it's
generally thought that you know
it's there because of the information

465
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,960
you're getting from your muscles and
tendons and that sort of thing.

466
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,280
The rubber hand illusion shows
how that can be overridden
by visual information.

467
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,360
The rubber hand illusion shows
the powerful connection between
what we see and what we feel.

468
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,280
But it reveals even more than simply
the way our senses are connected.

469
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:08,320
It hints that a fundamental
change in the brain is taking place.

470
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,680
Oh!

471
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,840
Isn't that strange?!
Yeah, that's creepy.

472
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,040
What might be going on in
this illusion is that

473
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,200
the brain is actually changing to
accommodate the new rubber hand.

474
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,600
Going through some sort of structural
change that we call neuroplasticity.

475
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:37,560
Neuroplasticity is an exciting new
idea that suggests the brain can
change in response to experience.

476
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,960
And this is what's taking place
in the rubber hand illusion.

477
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,440
The brain may be temporarily
re-wiring itself to adopt
the plastic hand as its own.

478
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,920
It really feeling like it's
your hand now, huh? Yes.

479
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,160
Is that a little weird?

480
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,240
Yes. We like weird
in perceptual psychology!

481
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,760
Here we go.

482
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,600
Was that scary? Yes.

483
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,640
Good, we like that!

484
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,080
'Brain plasticity
is a terrifically exciting'

485
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,360
sort of phenomenon
for perceptual psychology.

486
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,440
I think the rubber hand illusion
shows that.

487
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,320
That the brain can change,
based on a new experience.

488
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,600
This is important for somebody,
say, who doesn't have vision,
to know that they can compensate

489
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,880
through plasticity with another sense
and use that to navigate the world.

490
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,400
This idea of a plastic,
flexible brain is so exciting

491
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,440
because of the phenomenal
possibilities it contains.

492
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:43,120
Not only do our senses work
together, but it suggests one
could be used to replace another.

493
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,920
CLICKING

494
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,920
I lost my first eye at the age
of seven months, and my second

495
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,600
at the age of 13 months,
to retinoblastoma,
which is a retinal tumour.

496
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,640
I have no visual memories at all.

497
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,360
CLICKING

498
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,080
Although Daniel is completely blind,
he's developed a remarkable ability

499
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,520
to see,
using his sense of hearing alone.

500
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,280
CLICKS HIS TONGUE

501
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,040
People do express surprise

502
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,200
at a blind person cycling.

503
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,000
I think different people
are good at different things.

504
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,920
I was good at cycling
but I wasn't much for ball sports.

505
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,840
Using the sound of his tongue
clicks, Daniel has learned to
echolocate, just like a bat.

506
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,240
Echolocation
is just another way of seeing.

507
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,960
It's a way of seeing with sound
instead of light.

508
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,760
You extract images
from the patterns of sound
as they reflect off the environment.

509
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,960
When Daniel clicks,
the sound waves he produces
bounce off nearby objects.

510
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:28,400
From the returning echoes,
Daniel creates an image in his mind,
which he uses to navigate the world.

511
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,200
It's an ability that's enabled him
to overcome the impossible.

512
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,600
I could cycle without echolocating
for a brief while, and then it would
end uncomfortably.

513
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,200
It's kind of like they say,

514
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,040
"Falling is really quite a blast,
it's the striking the ground that's
the real bummer." So, yeah...

515
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,640
But Daniel can show us
far more than what one
extraordinary man can achieve.

516
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,400
His remarkable bat-like abilities
are helping scientists reveal the
hidden potential of the brain.

517
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,880
Professor Lutz Wiegrebe
is an expert in bat echolocation,
but now in Daniel,

518
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,160
he's been given the unique
opportunity to study
his first human subject.

519
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,720
Wow. That is very cool.

520
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,640
There's another one!

521
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Today, Lutz is conducting
a series of MRI scans,

522
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,760
to find out what happens inside
Daniel's brain when he echolocates.

523
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,240
For me personally, this has been a
really great experience, because
I've been working on the

524
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,520
echolocation of bats and
we've only recently started working

525
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,640
on echolocation with humans.

526
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:05,160
Having Daniel around is like
almost being able to talk to a bat,
and Daniel is not only exceptionally

527
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,080
good at echolocation, he's also
exceptionally good at verbalising
how he does it.

528
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,200
Inside the scanner,
Daniel is hearing virtual echoes.

529
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,760
This should enable the team to see
which parts of his brain

530
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,720
are activated when he echolocates
in the real world.

531
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,000
Lutz suspects that when Daniel
clicks, something remarkable may
be happening inside his brain.

532
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Even though he can't see, the sounds
he hears may still be activating
parts of his visual brain.

533
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,600
What we are interested in is
so-called cross-modal plasticity,
which means that these parts

534
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,840
of the principal visual cortex are
taken over by auditory information.

535
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,040
Lutz is looking for evidence to show
just how malleable the human brain
really is.

536
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,920
Not only can experience
temporarily change the brain,

537
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:19,680
but as Daniel seems to suggest,
these changes can also be permanent.

538
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,120
It means that at the extreme

539
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,080
extent of...

540
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,000
the cross-modal plasticity on
a perceptual level that Daniel

541
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,800
has demonstrated, he can
really see with his ears.

542
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,000
That it's not only that he can
process spatial information acquired
with his auditory system, but that

543
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,640
he can also recruit parts of
his visual cortex to do this task.

544
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,520
It's just a demonstration how

545
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,520
plastic the system is,
and how intelligently it's designed.

546
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,960
If one part of the brain
has really no input any more because

547
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,760
of a sensory deprivation,
then this part can be taken
over by other modalities.

548
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,080
As unique individuals
like Daniel seem to show,

549
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,960
the human brain can change and adapt
in the most phenomenal way.

550
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,120
This has implications not only for
people whose senses are impaired,

551
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,200
it has the potential
to affect us all.

552
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,440
For Dr Angus Rupert, finding a way
of replacing one sense with another
has been a lifelong ambition.

553
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,480
It's `, rdlmthat for
his colleagues at Fort Rucker
Aviation Centre in Alabama

554
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,360
could mean the difference
between life and death.

555
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,680
Since 1990 alone, we've lost between
ten and 30 pilots and air crew
per year,

556
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,440
just due to spatial disorientation.

557
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,520
These are the figures across
our army, navy and air force.

558
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,240
We define spatial disorientation as
occurs whenever a pilot misperceives

559
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:23,440
the position, motion or attitude
of his aircraft, relative to the
Earth or other significant objects.

560
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,960
In other words it's,
"Which way is up?"

561
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,280
In normal circumstances, pilots
can correct the problem of spatial
disorientation by using their eyes.

562
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,080
But there are instances when they
can't always rely on what they see.

563
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,800
When you are flying, there is no way
for you to know where down is

564
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,120
unless you are actually
looking at the horizon

565
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,000
or looking at an indicator

566
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,200
to give you the information
in the aircraft.

567
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,240
But Angus Rupert
thinks he has found the solution.

568
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,360
It comes in the form of the Tactile Situation Awareness System, or TSAS,

569
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,920
which uses touch to support
or replace the sense of vision.

570
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,680
Together with research pilot
John Ramiccio,

571
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:21,880
they've found a way of giving pilots
spatial awareness by using a series
of vibrating pads called tactors.

572
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,600
So, in this situation we have
John wearing tactors incorporated
into the shoulder harness.

573
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,160
These are the ones telling him
if he is too high.

574
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,760
In the seat we have tactors letting
him know if he's getting too low

575
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,680
as well as tactors
around his waist here.

576
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,360
And you can see these tactors

577
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,200
giving information as to which way
he is drifting in space.

578
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,320
So confident are they in how the
system works, it's being
put to the test

579
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:59,280
on a pilot who will attempt to fly
with his eyes completely closed.

580
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,800
So it's at some risk that we are
not successful

581
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,920
but that's the essence of science,
is to experiment

582
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,320
and so this is raw...

583
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,400
and un-attempted-before footage.

584
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,240
We will have Captain Wingate
close his eyes, and use
the tactile cues to land

585
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,800
the helicopter so he
is going to be fully reliant
on feel for spatial orientation.

586
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,320
I would like you to take off
down the runway.

587
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,280
Do you feel the upper tactor fire?

588
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,280
It's your shoulder harness
telling you that you're
above 100 feet, which is perfect.

589
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,680
Eyes closed.

590
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,720
Zero the tactor out on the belly
button so you know you need
a little bit of...

591
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,080
There is your belly button tactor.
Keep your eyes closed.

592
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,600
Feel that increase,
it means velocity is getting fast.

593
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,840
Slow it down a little bit. Very nice.

594
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,680
Don't dump power.
You are on a nice descent right now.

595
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,720
I am not going to give you
any warnings.

596
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,080
Your seat pad will tell you 10 ft.

597
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,080
That's not going around.
That is me preparing cushion.

598
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,520
Right? You are on the ground.

599
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,720
LAUGHTER
Nice job! Nice job!

600
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,080
That was a first
for TSAS right there.

601
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,680
Eyes closed approach from over 100ft.

602
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,120
Straight to the ground

603
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,800
like crazy men. OK.

604
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,480
For pilots on the front lines,
this ability to make more of their

605
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,920
other senses could make all
the difference in the world.

606
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,600
I've done numerous dust landings
sat roadsides where you have

607
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,440
zero reference with the ground
because of the dust outside.

608
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,120
It's talcum powder -
very thick and it envelops you.

609
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,800
So to be able to use your body
and adjust appropriately,

610
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,240
not only are you saving
the guy's life on the ground

611
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,920
but you also have the guys on
board you are trying to protect.

612
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,560
It gives you another ability to...

613
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,960
adjust appropriately
so that's amazing.

614
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,240
I am very excited and pleased to be
able to say it is a wonderful feeling

615
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,920
in your heart to know you have an
answer for a problem that will save

616
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,000
many lives under many different types
of conditions, not just in aviation
but in many other situations.

617
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,640
This new technology
has profound implications,

618
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,040
helping to reveal what our senses
are really capable of.

619
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,800
As we use touch,
we will find there are more

620
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:53,360
and more applications in the future
and they will be almost limitless,
only limited by our imagination.

621
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,680
And it is up to us to come up with
new and better ways to use this.

622
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,920
And I am sure there are people out
there that will take this technology
and carry it well into the future.

623
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,480
And that future may be
just around the corner.

624
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,560
In the small German town
of Osnabruck, a group of scientists

625
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,640
have been pioneering
a groundbreaking new experiment.

626
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:39,320
They've been pushing the boundary of
our sensory capability, attempting
to give a man an entirely new sense.

627
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,680
They've been trying to see if
humans can make use of the earth's
magnetic field, just like birds.

628
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,960
So in the beginning
we came up with the idea you

629
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,600
could use the magnetic field of the
earth to augment the sensory system

630
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,200
and extend the sensory experience

631
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,960
you usually have.

632
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,360
For the past six years, they've been
developing the feelSpace belt -

633
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,200
a vibrating sensory device
that enables the wearer to feel
the position of magnetic north.

634
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,480
So actually that's the prototype
of the belt, so we did the first...

635
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,600
exploratory study with that belt

636
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,720
and it exists, basically

637
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,400
of a row of vibrators
like in cell phones
so these green things are vibrating.

638
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,160
And at the other side
is the most important part.

639
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:43,120
The compass
feeds information to the control box
and the control box then controls

640
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,200
all these vibrators.

641
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:52,960
So if you put it around your waist,
like this, there is always one
of the vibrators vibrating.

642
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,240
This one is vibrating because there's
north and if I turn like this,

643
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,400
the next one is vibrating
and if I turn like this,
the next one is vibrating.

644
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,840
So a signal's going around my waist.

645
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,920
I think it's not so important how
it looks but it really works so...!

646
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,040
Udo Wachter was one
of the volunteers
who took part in the study.

647
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,480
For six weird weeks, he wore the
belt every moment of his waking day.

648
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,920
In the beginning it was a little
bit strange because one isn't very

649
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,440
used to having a constant buzzing
on the body,

650
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,400
and I'm also a little
bit ticklish in certain places!

651
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,160
But it didn't take very long
to get used to it,

652
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,360
after a day or so, I didn't really
realise it was there any more.

653
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:57,520
The first clue the team were on to
something came when they noticed an
important and unexpected phenomenon.

654
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,160
Strangely, wearers found it
difficult to articulate
what they were experiencing.

655
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,680
It was a sign something really
significant was taking place.

656
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,960
It's a characteristic of senses
that it's so specific and so special

657
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,640
that it's hard to communicate
to someone who does not have it.

658
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,280
You can't communicate
how it is to see red to someone
who has never seen red.

659
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,880
It hints at the possibility that
there is really integration of
new sensory information going on.

660
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,800
In the modern world,
there's no shortage of technology
to find our way around.

661
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,280
But the feelSpace system
was unlike any other kind of device.

662
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,160
For the first time
it suggested new sensory

663
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,760
information could be absorbed
without having to think about it.

664
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,240
You might say, you can just have a
compass, and look at it and then you

665
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,600
can find your way anyways but this
is what we do not want to find.

666
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,800
We want to help subjects
integrate this kind of

667
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,960
information in a way which makes it
available to them just intuitively.

668
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:20,400
Usually senses do not work
or they do not need attention so you
open your eyes and see,

669
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,800
you take out earplugs and you hear,
and you just put your hand down here
and you feel that it's sand here.

670
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,880
After six weeks
of intensive training,

671
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,840
Udo and the other volunteers
faced the ultimate challenge.

672
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:48,400
Using only his new magnetic sense,
Udo had to navigate blindfold
around a previously unseen shape.

673
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,600
And even when
deliberately disorientated,

674
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,600
he still managed to find his way
back to his starting position
with remarkable accuracy...

675
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,520
an otherwise impossible task.

676
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:27,520
While wearing the belt, it felt like
having a new sense and after a
very short time it just felt like it

677
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,120
should always be there,
and it felt like it always was there.

678
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,280
After its initial trial,
the feelSpace belt offers us
a glimpse of the future,

679
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,760
suggesting we may not be limited
by the senses we are born with.

680
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,120
The team are already working
on a more extensive trial,

681
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:55,400
where they will probe the system's
impact on the brain
in even greater detail

682
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:01,520
but it's clear that when it
comes to creating new senses,
this is just the beginning.

683
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,960
Just the idea that
there are more ways

684
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,000
to experience the world
is just fascinating.

685
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,920
I wouldn't say it's going beyond...

686
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,640
er...

687
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,520
evolution, it's more like...

688
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,000
I would say it's more like
a part of evolution.

689
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,640
Because I would say evolution is
nothing which stopped ten years ago,

690
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,160
or 100 years ago,
or stopped just now,

691
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:34,040
but it's going on. And if it's going
to work out and if we are successful
with this study and we find out it is

692
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:41,840
working then it's an important step
for science, but also for everyone
who is a human being, in a way.

693
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,480
Over the past ten years,
our understanding of the senses
has undergone a revolution.

694
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,800
It's enabling us to finally unlock
the extraordinary potential
of our minds...

695
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:11,440
and promising to transform
all our lives in the most
weird and wonderful ways.

696
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,280
So next time you're not sure
whether to believe what you see...

697
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,680
enjoy it,
because these tricks of the mind are
how you make sense of your world.
