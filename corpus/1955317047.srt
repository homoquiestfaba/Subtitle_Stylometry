Bano? El bano?
- Bano? You mean, el bano?

00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:53,117
The bathroom's that way, asshole.
- Gracias. Muchas gracias.

8
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,116
I'm gonna speak to something now cause I see
you over here and I know you're concerned.

9
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,295
Something that's largely unspoken, something
almost taboo that we choose to ignore.

10
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,326
People, people like you, buyers, you come on
to this lot with expectations and with fears

11
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,626
and with this belief that all
salespeople are basically conmen.

12
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:27,921
Swindlers, hustlers, out to do you in.
Out for blood, your blood.

13
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:30,843
So you talk to friends and family and
they tell you you gotta go in there...

14
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:33,556
you gotta be concerned,
you gotta watch these guys.

15
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:36,267
You gotta duck whatever
sucker punches they throw.

16
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:39,635
You're both asking yourselves right
now, "When will this guy make his move?"

17
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,368
You said some things, I said
some things. I've apologized.

18
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:49,375
I just wanna make this right.
Elda, dear, where did we go astray?

19
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:54,424
You make me sick. Leave me alone!
- Helda, had I known

20
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,744
your son had been killed in a similar
vehicle, I certainly wouldn't have pushed.

21
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:01,993
Unfortunately, yes, you should
be watching me, absolutely.

22
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:05,951
Because the best in this business
are by virtue fabulous magicians.

23
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:09,354
Their sleeves are loaded.
Now you see it, now you don't.

24
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:13,633
But you have to understand the nature of
the sale, in order to understand the sell.

25
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:18,166
I don't know if you know this, but as
a rule the Japanese machine everything.

26
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:22,081
All the cranks, the gears, the struts,
down to the micronometer. - Micronometer.

27
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,207
You got various metric measurements,
centimeter, millimeter, so on and so forth.

28
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,672
Then you got the micronometer, which is
roughly the circumference of a human hair.

29
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,302
And what their machinists do
at that microscopic level...

30
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:36,058
it would be the equivalent of you or I
trying to perform heart surgery on a fly.

31
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:40,771
At any rate, listen... you look like
a guy from my neck of the woods.

32
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:45,324
Let me do you the courtesy of being blunt.
Permit me that, let me be frank with you.

33
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,813
They lab test these goddamn things
in Japan. They bury the tach at rpms

34
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,809
for days on end... they simulate,
100000 miles. Manifolds are red hot,

35
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,704
the bearings finally snap. The
engine collapses. They go through it.

36
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,578
They find out what went out
where, and they correct it.

37
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:05,025
That is why these folks have been making
light of the big three for the last 20 years

38
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:08,909
On this they did that?
- Absolutely.

39
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:13,877
It's pressure. It's movement. It's
commission. It's incentive. It's hard sell.

40
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:17,179
This is it! What do you say? I saw
this and I knew your name's on this.

41
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:20,758
Where you going? No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait! Come on, come on!

42
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:25,135
You take a walk over to Danny Woo's. He's
the biggest resaler on the West Coast.

43
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,779
You'll see that embodied
in his sales policy.

44
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,435
I used to work for the guy, so
I know a few things about him.

45
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,746
He told me once in a moment of candor,
"I don't hire salesmen, I hire hitmen."

46
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,493
You walk on that lot, and you're stepping
into the crosshairs of some zealot.

47
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,297
Some guy so bent on selling you an auto,
it becomes his primary means of existence.

48
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,447
I don't think they ever publicly
referred to it as a "timebomb."

49
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,527
Maybe it was "deathtrap," "rolling
coffin," something or other.

50
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:52,761
You gotta keep in mind how heavyhanded
the media is with the adjectives.

51
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:56,570
What everyone seems to forget is
the sterling performance record...

52
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:59,187
that the Pinto had achieved
up until that incident.

53
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:02,258
Coupled with the fact that it was a
Peterbilt fifthwheel diesel truck...

54
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:06,443
doing upwards of eighty on impact...
and all four passengers, driver included,

55
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:11,194
were packaday plus smokers. You know you
don't need to be Mr. Wizard to deduce...

56
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:15,900
a semitruck travelling at high velocity...
colliding with a subcompact car...

57
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:20,913
gasoline, cigarettes. You come out of that
situation without resembling charcoal...

58
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:23,543
I'd say you've been personally
touched by the hand of God.

59
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:26,123
You don't smoke, do you?
- No, not at all.

60
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:31,075
Ever been rearended by a runaway
eighteenwheeler? - No. - Bingo.

61
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:35,586
I'm gonna tell you folks flat out... we are
not here to gouge the buyer, to stiff you.

62
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,310
The knocking will go away.
Listen, listen.

63
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,478
That's dual port, that's fuel
injection, that's sixteen valve.

64
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,908
I don't know the technical terminology,
but I can assure you that's good.

65
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:49,059
If that's disrupting the
status quo, giving pause...

66
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,576
giving truth to a business
that thrives on untruth...

67
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,962
Listen to that. That's music to
my ears, and I hope to yours too.

68
00:06:55,678 --> 00:07:00,296
...then I say so be it. Because there are no
jukes or jab steps here, no Jekyl and Hyde.

69
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,429
We deal straight, with
a smile and a handshake.

70
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,191
Does that make us part of a dying breed?

71
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,877
By God, I hope so.

72
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:20,267
Ray, I frankly... I never said that.
I never said that, Ray.

73
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,557
Let me put you on hold. Ginger,
wait a minute. What's going on?

74
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:28,327
I'm out of here. - I need two weeks notice.
- Two weeks notice? Forget two weeks notice.

75
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:31,120
I need ten working days.
- I have kids to worry about!

76
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:35,028
Kids? How old are you? - That doesn't
matter. I gotta go down to Mr. Woo' s.

77
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:37,674
Do you know what I get down there?
I get full medical, full dental.

78
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:41,522
I can get acupuncture if I want. - What the
hell is acupuncture? - Don't worry about it.

79
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:44,549
Don't expect a reference out of me.
- I don't need your reference.

80
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,347
Good, 'cause you won't get it.
Do you hear me? You won't get it!

81
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,966
Ray? Ray, are you there?

82
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:56,172
No. Listen to me. Two months
I've been waiting on this.

83
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:59,991
You come back with a list, "Lincoln
Continental, Cadillac Eldorado"?

84
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:03,490
How am I supposed to move vehicles get five
miles to the gallon in this kind of economy?

85
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:06,524
There's no small makes,
there's no midsize.

86
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:11,113
And what is this Zephyr, AMC
Javelin, Volare shit about?

87
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,773
What are we, a fucking orphanage?
Come on, Ray!

88
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,906
I feel like I'm getting blindside with
a different line of bullshit every week.

89
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:21,082
I feel like I need a flak
jacket every time we talk.

90
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:26,413
Jesus what happened to you? - Can we get the
trunk on the Charger fixed? It got me again.

91
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:31,263
Ray, I did not say
that... I did not say that.

92
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:35,426
It don't know where you hear that...
- Mike, Julie, bless your patience.

93
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:38,414
Can I get you anything while I'm in
here, coffee perhaps? - That'd be great!

94
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,719
Sons of bitches want coffee.
- I need a better list than this.

95
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,704
I cannot work with this list.
This list is shit!

96
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:53,383
Is that that fucker Ray? Don't let
him off the phone. I wanna talk to him.

97
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:56,195
You know what, Ray... I
don't understand how you live.

98
00:08:56,211 --> 00:09:00,271
I don't understand how you're still
in business. - Get the blue book.

99
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:03,521
I need the blue book.
- What you're doing to us is bullshit!

100
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:08,533
That's right. It sure as hell
is. Delivery? Ray...delivery?

101
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:12,734
You couldn't deliver an old lady across
an intersection. - Let me talk to him.

102
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:17,308
Ray, guess who this is. It's
me, yeah, asshole. Listen to me.

103
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,901
You know what? It is me. Bob's a
nice guy. I'm not a fucking nice guy.

104
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:29,309
Where are our cars?
I can't believe you gave us this list.

105
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:33,126
Do you really think this is gonna fly?

106
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:38,275
You must or you wouldn't have sent
it to us. Where are our cars, Ray?

107
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,830
Do you understand me? - This isn't my sale,
this is his fucking sale. - Yeah, let's go.

108
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,021
The idea is we want you to roll off this
lot, not walk. - Jesus! - Are you all right?

109
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,300
She's okay. Did it scald? - I don't think
this is gonna happen. - Don't touch me!

110
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,799
My partner's got a fairly nasty cut. - My
wife is in some serious discomfort here.

111
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:04,292
He's inside, he's bleeding badly.
Please, try and be understanding.

112
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:09,889
Okay, one minute, one minute. - Hang there,
I'm gonna be right w,ith you, Mister...

113
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:13,934
No, no, asshole. You don't song
and dance me with that bullshit.

114
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,542
You sold my kid this sack of shit,
which has no fucking airbag, by the way.

115
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:24,538
If you don't give me that money, I'm gonna
lay my BoogPowell all over your fucking lot!

116
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:29,495
Okay, sir. Please, the language.
Who...what's your son's name?

117
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:33,684
Dickie. That is my kid, Dickie
Dupree, and I'm his father Dick Senior.

118
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:37,839
I don't doubt that for a second.
Folks, give me fifteen seconds.

119
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,719
I'm gonna be right with you. Folks,
fifteen seconds, that's all I ask, okay?

120
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,758
Folks, folks? Wait a minute. What
are you doing? Sir, don't do that.

121
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:50,727
Please, you're being very discouraging.
I don't need you dissuading my clientele.

122
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:54,064
You listen, cocksucker. You're gonna
give me that money, my kid's money.

123
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:58,026
My kid, who works his ass off...
throwing people's papers on their porches

124
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,363
at five in the morning...
mowing their lawns in degree weather...

125
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,115
doing all the shit that kids do to earn money
and you sonsofbitches robbed him blind!

126
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,762
Give me a moment to compose.
How much was it?

127
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,220
Two thousand six hundred and ninety nine
dollars plus tax you owe him, jerkoff!

128
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:17,827
What? What did you say?
Where did you get that figure?

129
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:21,054
You must've pulled that
out of your ass, Ray.

130
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,185
Do you know how many cars we have on
the lot right now? Do you have any idea?

131
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:27,677
We have eleven cars on the lot.
We have eleven fucking vehicles.

132
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,455
Do you know how much passing
interest that elicits right next door

133
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:34,046
to the biggest dealer on the West Coast?
You obviously have a grudge against us!

134
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,666
Listen to me. Forget about
that shit, listen to me.

135
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:40,552
You have until noon to make something happen,
to get us a list that's not this bullshit.

136
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:43,245
Do you understand? You have till noon.
If you do not give me that list...

137
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:46,941
I will hit you with a lawsuit that will
make Nuremburg look like small claims court.

138
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,552
Do you understand me, Ray? Do it!

139
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:19,918
They walked. - You let them walk?
- I didn't let them walk, you went AWOL.

140
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:22,826
Look at this shit. Does this look like I can
go back out there? They asked me for a quote

141
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:25,578
So come off the top of your head with
something. You don't let them stew.

142
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,792
You turn your back on them, we're dead - You
couldn't handle them while I handled Ray?

143
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,807
Five minutes? - I was doing fine.
- You were not doing fine?

144
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,434
I gotta go out there and fill in for you...
this idiot is outside scaring everybody off.

145
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:38,635
Saying we cracked his kid's piggybank
on that Starlet. - Dupree, from last week.

146
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:41,822
The ugly little carrottop
hick? His old man showed up?

147
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,323
And the son-of-a-bitch was shooting flames.

148
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:47,365
What did you do about the money? - Obviously
he ain't getting it back. - Obviously.

149
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:50,173
I don't see the pursuit of
legal action in this halfwit...

150
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:54,492
so I made a small, cursory move toward
the Buick, the Skylark out there...

151
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:57,135
and he was all over
it like long lost love.

152
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,162
So long, asshole...

153
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:10,668
You traded up even. You didn't let him roll
with the Starlet and roll with the Skylark.

154
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,603
The guy was cancer. I had to get him off
the lot. - That's a tenth of the inventory.

155
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:18,630
We still made a profit. I am not gonna argue
with you on this. - It sticks, so I can't...

156
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:22,473
You sure Dick and Jane are gone? - They've
flown, man. They're up the block at Woo's.

157
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:29,673
Don't blame me. I say, what? You don't
believe in killing the messenger? Hello!

158
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:37,089
I wish I could keep the visit
strictly social, fellas...

159
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,719
but to tell you the truth,
I'm in a bit of a spot.

160
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,594
I don't wanna take you through
all the twists and turns...

161
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:47,285
but to be perfectly pinpoint
with you, I'm being audited.

162
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:51,229
Damn it, Dan.
- IRS. Backbiting bastards.

163
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,761
Cheap shot sonsofbitches,
they pick on the good guys.

164
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:57,634
Save the venom, boys. No sense in
beating a dead horse, it's done.

165
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,167
They're gonna put my books through the
paces and see how the pennies line up.

166
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:04,837
I got the gals in accounting on
override trying to shore things up.

167
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:10,421
Nip and tuck. Keep it from getting nasty.
Trying to shield Dottie from this mess.

168
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,646
How's she doing, anyway, Dan?
- It varies week to week.

169
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:18,370
Got a bushel of medical bills.
Specialists, second opinions...

170
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,910
crap shoot crackpots, witch doctors.
What do they know, anyway? - Nothing.

171
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:28,661
What exactly is it that's wrong with her?
- She's anemic.

172
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,662
She inherited it. Weak
circulatory system,

173
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:38,365
transfusions...it s ugly.
But I love her.

174
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,231
God damn it, I love her. Take the
world off its axis if she asked me to.

175
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,737
It's a tough time.
- What can we do? You say it...

176
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:52,338
You say it, it's as good as done.
- Boy... Jesus, that is...

177
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:58,422
Thank you. I do sincerely appreciate it.

178
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:02,909
Fact is, fellas, they are gonna
be sending someone down to see you.

179
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:07,803
They are going to be interviewing all
my former employees, associates, so on.

180
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:13,655
I'd be indebted if you could
possibly...I don't know.

181
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,300
Kudos and kind words across
the board for you, Dan.

182
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:22,096
Bob, that's what I needed to hear.
- A better man we have not known.

183
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,582
Consider it done.
- Sid, you're a very gracious man.

184
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:30,454
Thank you, thank you both.
I am gonna take care of you for this.

185
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:35,742
I am eternally, eternally grateful.
- No more than we are. It's not necessary.

186
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:40,433
Not necessary at all. - It certainly is.
I mean it. I'm going to repay you for this.

187
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:44,070
You can't imagine what this
means to me. You have no idea.

188
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:49,824
Knock, knock. - Hello, beautiful.
Did you come dpwn to eat with me?

189
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:54,375
I brought some sandwiches and some
orange slices and some other goodies.

190
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,616
You remember these nice young men, don't
you? - Hello, ma'am, it's good to see you.

191
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,989
How are you, ma'am?
- I'm trying to get back on my feet.

192
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:05,784
You're going to be back on your feet
for keeps, sweetie. Don't forget it.

193
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,737
We're going to take off and let you
eat lunch. - Let me know how it goes.

194
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:15,156
They'll be calling you. Just remember,
answer them straight. No dancing or dodging.

195
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:18,686
I have absolutely nothing to hide.
- Sure thing. Take care, okay?

196
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:22,511
I will be making good on this.
Believe it.

197
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:27,605
Danny Woo. That son-of-a-bitch...
If I bear but one grudge in this life.

198
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,417
He got Stan... - And Cliff,
and Ginger walked today, too.

199
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,265
He took Ginger. - She walked today?
- He's a fucking born money man.

200
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,971
If I had what he had, I'd
run it ragged, I would.

201
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:42,120
We worked for that guy for three years,
and in that time I never understood.

202
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,981
Understood what?
- How that guy makes money.

203
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:48,170
One, he's connected like
a fucking switchboard.

204
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:50,992
Two, he's got a network that
puts the Hebrews to shame.

205
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,788
And three, he's got the
gals, and the skirts sell.

206
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,289
No shit. Loan me a vagina,
I'll show you how to sell.

207
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:59,154
No shit. We're down here busting our
asses, dumping sticker prices left and right

208
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,967
and that bastard wraps a sale,
financing and all, inside an hour.

209
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,794
Tell me he ain't doing that with mirrors.
- You gotta suffocate them to sell them.

210
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:07,922
That's all there is to it. - It doesn't
require any talent to sell at Woo's anymore.

211
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,282
It's not like it was when
we were there. The staff now

212
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:13,903
has all the subtlety of a fucking great
white. - This is a now business, my friend.

213
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,786
Do you know what that means?
It means you're here... - Now.

214
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:21,821
The car's here... - Now. - The deal's
here... - Now. - Sign it! - Right now!

215
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:25,470
It doesn't require any skill anymore,
any aptitude. The showroom sells it.

216
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:30,529
You put a Mercedes sedan under glass,
people are curious. It's the presentation.

217
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,332
A guy can go out and move this...
he can sell a '78 Vega wagon.

218
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:39,600
Get a price for that, you got my
undying respect. You cannot sell shit.

219
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,350
I know. Because shit don't sell.
- Have you looked at this lately? - No.

220
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:47,110
You need to look at this. We are
eightythree thousand dollars in the hole.

221
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:52,215
Eightythree...eightythree
thousand in the fucking red?

222
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,660
One eight, one three and three zeros.
Come on, you're not blind.

223
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,900
It's gotten bad. What do we have out
there that's moving? And be honest.

224
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:04,086
We need a draw. - We just need
something. I don't care if it's one car.

225
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:08,070
We just gotta goose business a little.
'Cause all we got right now is a parking lot

226
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,766
A bunch of cars sitting
around waiting to die.

227
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,497
#DEAD ASPHALT#

228
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:43,591
#CONFAB WITH RAY#

229
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,657
You got trouble telling time now
or what? - So I'm a little late.

230
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:50,577
You are a little late. Where's
the list? - I don't have a list.

231
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,631
What do you mean, I don't have a list?
- I have one car for you.

232
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:59,280
A '63 convertible Le Mans. - You're
kidding. I know you're kidding, Ray.

233
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:05,139
A 63' convertible Le Mans and...
- And a '63 convertible Le Mans.

234
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:09,385
That's it. - Are you honing your
standup routine? You must be.

235
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:15,970
One car? One car, asshole? - I said noon.
Didn't I say noon to you on the phone?

236
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:19,227
Right now, it's ten after two, and
you re gonna show up with one car?

237
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:22,271
Worth two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. - Jesus.

238
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:25,647
Must be pretty cherry then, right, Ray?
- Like a tricked up, turned out,

239
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,340
fucking fantazmobile, be worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

240
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:31,899
Must be. Right Ray?
- I want that list. I asked you for a list.

241
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:35,044
I don't have a list. I have one car worth
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

242
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:38,468
That's bullshit. I don't want some
deal... - Two days. You sit on it.

243
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:42,404
It ain't for sale, it's ain't
for shit but show. And that's it.

244
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:46,435
I don't want to hear this out of you.
I want my list.

245
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:50,181
This is a bullshit deal, and I cannot
believe you would bring this to us.

246
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:54,375
I cannot believe you would bring this to us.
- I bring this to you, throw you this bone,

247
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,709
because I know you've been sitting
back on the dime quite a ways.

248
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,210
Because you put us there.
Let me ask you something.

249
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,733
How come I gotta trudge
through this shit...

250
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:04,824
Volares and Aspens and every other
piece of shit Gremlin you wanna bring me?

251
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:07,824
And I look over at Woo's lot, and
I know that you're bidding for him.

252
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:10,343
And I don't see any of
that crap over there.

253
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,666
And you want me to take some deal about
some Le Mans that's carrying something?

254
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,743
I got nothing out of you, Ray.
- How many times do I have to tell you?

255
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,803
It's worth two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. All you have to do is let it sit.

256
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,442
If I take a bag of coke and
walk it across the street...

257
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:25,255
it's probably worth 250000 dollars...
That doesn't mean I'm gonna do it.

258
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:28,509
I give you my word. Nothing
will happen. - Your word?

259
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:32,753
Your word is useless to me. - You park the
car on the side, and let it sit there.

260
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:36,136
Your word is useless to me.
- And you collect 250000 dollars.

261
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:40,915
And I know you need it.
I pity your situation.

262
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,467
I don't want your pity.
I'm so sick of your ass.

263
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,825
I'm trying to come
here and help you out.

264
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:51,384
We've been out on a limb for two months
'cause you haven't come through with a list.

265
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:55,947
A simple list. That's all we're asking for.
- I'm sorry, I made a few mistakes.

266
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:58,737
I'm trying to apologize and bring
it back to you by giving you

267
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:01,335
something worth two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.

268
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:05,509
Your word means shit to me.
How do I know what's in that car?

269
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:08,233
I wanna know what's in that car.
- I don't know what's in that car.

270
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:14,500
Sometimes in life you have
to do things sight unseen.

271
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:19,717
The car is worth to you two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars...

272
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:24,658
in bigass, cold, hard cash...
No strings attached.

273
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:32,837
#THE FEDS# Over the past two months,
nearly thirtyfour bodies have been found...

274
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:36,686
in varying stages of post mortem decay...
stretching from here to South America.

275
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,550
While the supposition that
these deaths are somehow linked

276
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:44,808
may seem both premature and remote... we
have established a plausible connection.

277
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:48,856
The method of killing differs in each one,
but the bodies, all thirtyfour,

278
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:53,379
were found in close proximity to a road
or freeway. This is what we have thus far.

279
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,232
The most recent discovery
yielded seven dead in a 48 hour span.

280
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:00,893
Victor E. Drubb, 33 years of age,
shot six times at close range...

281
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:06,355
Frank R. Priolo. 29. He was
identified from dental records.

282
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,488
It seems most of his face was removed by
two short range blasts from a gauge shotgun.

283
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,676
And finally, Mitchell Wayne Richter. 26.

284
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,758
He was found about five days ago
with four other unidentified men.

285
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:21,123
his entire chest cavity, clavicle,
sternum and lower torso...

286
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,059
are crushed by what appears to
be the impact of a moving car.

287
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,581
He also had superficial
knife and bullet wounds.

288
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,922
The common denominator shared by these
men outside of their present condition...

289
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:37,094
is the fact that each of them has
an extensive criminal history...

290
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,979
from the three I've just profiled
to the remaining thirtyone.

291
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:43,287
From shoplifting, domestic
terrorism, petty thieves...

292
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,934
convicted arsonists, mercenaries, rap
sheets and arrest records abounding.

293
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,997
Intelligence gathering up to this point
has been rather marginal and slow in coming.

294
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:54,733
But given this initial information, we
have ruled out any aimless murder spree.

295
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:57,235
These were not wanton,
random acts of violence...

296
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,736
they were measured, calculated attacks.

297
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:04,272
Continuing on, we have two witnesses,
both freight line drivers...

298
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:08,423
that remember seeing Drubb outside the El
Matador truck stop in Needles, California.

299
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:12,577
They say they saw him exchanging what appea-
red to be money with one of the mechanics.

300
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:16,255
money the mechanic denies ever receiving.
No one witnessed the shooting...

301
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:20,952
but we have strong physical evidence
suggesting that Mr. Priolo was the gunman.

302
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:24,279
A discarded pistol
found near the body...

303
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,155
matches the grain and the caliber
of the slug extracted from Drubb.

304
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,745
The spacing of the wounds and the pattern
of the muzzle burns on Priolo's body...

305
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,542
indicate that he was
shot while he drove.

306
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:38,264
His car has not been recovered.
This brings us to Mr. Richter.

307
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:44,149
We have impounded a orange Oldsmobile
Toronado from the murder scene...

308
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,508
but the fiber on one of the victims
doesn't match the vehicle's interior.

309
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:51,097
The wounds on Richter are also
inconsistent with the Toronado's design.

310
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:54,110
And there was a noted absence
of bone and blood fragment...

311
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,475
on both the front and rear bumper.

312
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:59,108
Two months ago, near Quito,
Equador in the Andes Mountains...

313
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:02,435
a small indigenous tribe called
the Machu Pica was slaughtered.

314
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:05,730
Their emaciated bodies were
discovered piled up near a riverbed.

315
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:10,045
Each of the victims was bled almost
to the point of being drained dry.

316
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:13,063
We're operating under the
premise that this tribe...

317
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:15,685
somehow tampered or disrupted
the local drug trade...

318
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:18,211
and they were subsequently slaughtered.

319
00:25:19,032 --> 00:25:22,346
Now, strangely enough, we have
several confirmed sightings...

320
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:26,376
of a 1960's model red convertible
car of American make...

321
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:29,311
that was seen in the area
before and after the killings.

322
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,052
A week later in Cali, Columbia,
the same car is spotted...

323
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:35,001
and five men are butchered
outside a reputed drug den.

324
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,535
Eight days later,
same car, three dead...

325
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,929
found chainsawed and burned with
a blowtorch in a sugar cane field.

326
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:45,108
This pattern continues through
Guatemala, Vera Cruz, Mexico,

327
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,618
and ultimately Needles, California,
where both freight drivers interviewed

328
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:54,158
regarding the Drubb shooting, remember
seeing a, quote, "red convertible car."

329
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:58,492
Speculation is that this car is carrying
an exceptionally large narcotics shipment...

330
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:03,144
uncut cocaine, heroin, any
number of possibilities exist.

331
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:07,474
One thing we know for certain is that each
of these men was ambushed in succession...

332
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:12,462
each knowing exactly what the cargo
was, as well as its potential cash value.

333
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:15,682
Agents from the ATF and the Drug
Enforcement Agency have been tracking...

334
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:19,559
an elusive and very lucrative smuggling
operation for the past ten years now.

335
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:22,789
We have centered our efforts right here.
And believe me, gentlemen...

336
00:26:23,237 --> 00:26:28,450
something or someone, dead or alive...
will lead us directly to that car.

337
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:34,745
Did you get the thing, that
La Chappell, the financing?

338
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,274
'Cause I gotta wrap them up now. - I didn't
get that, but you're gonna love this.

339
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,725
What is this? #NOTICE OF EVICTION#
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

340
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:47,719
#STONEWALLED AND SNAKEBIT#

341
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,598
Are you serious? - We're out
of here. Tipped and turned.

342
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,703
These bastards ever consider
the concept of a grace period?

343
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:57,755
How the fuck do you do business
like this? - You don't, Sid, you don't.

344
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,294
Thirty day billing cycle, all their
bullshit, they give us five fucking days.

345
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:04,535
They don't budge. They never
Hardons, one and all.

346
00:27:04,684 --> 00:27:07,069
I hope their mothers contract cancer.
- Kicking us when we're down.

347
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,936
They're killing us when we're down.
What do we got left in the bank?

348
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,845
Bus fare, chump change.
You know that.

349
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,662
Yoy know what? I do not wanna
go out soup kitchen swan song.

350
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:21,681
I've seen it happen to too many guys.
You understand me?

351
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,351
We're going down, and
that is a factual fact.

352
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:28,083
And I don't know what to do,
and I don't know what to say.

353
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:30,658
I'm gonna say the only thing left to
say. I say we get liquid. You understand?

354
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:35,298
We get loaded, cash in hand, shed the
overhead, and bury this whole place.

355
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:38,461
What do we got to sell off, the cars?
- I'm not talking about that.

356
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,922
I'm talking about the Le Mans.
I'm talking about Ray's thing. - Jesus.

357
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:44,467
I'm talking about Ray's thing, because
that's all there is to talk about.

358
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:48,044
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?
- Do you have a feasible alternative?

359
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:51,804
If you don't, it's pretty much a one way
street. Are we in agreement about that?

360
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:56,617
Because we are flushed from every angle.
We are leveraged till doomsday,

361
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:59,398
we got creditors riding our ass into
a Chapter Thirteen. - So what, Sid?

362
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,235
We start clutching at straws...
- We start doing something...

363
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:06,841
Listen to me. We both know there is no
Pontiac convertible worth 250000 grand.

364
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:10,021
So it's not the car, it's what
the car is carrying. - Yeah, no shit!

365
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,119
And what that car is carrying
carries with it my concern.

366
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:16,480
It could be suitcases of
smack, guns, bodies, who knows.

367
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,336
So there's a wrinkle, there's a catch.
No shit, for that kind of money.

368
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,876
We're still talking about a
quarter of a million dollars.

369
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:24,720
I'd turn cartwheels for that kind of money.
- There's another way, there's another way.

370
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,037
You have a way to make that kind of money.
- What about insurance? - What do you mean?

371
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:31,757
A burn. Get somebody to put a match to
this place. - Are you fucking kidding me?

372
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:35,328
Do you have any idea how difficult it
is to pull a successful insurance scam?

373
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:39,414
You got cops and claims adjusters looking
you sideways, secondguessing everything.

374
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,942
That's assuming you got
somebody who understands fire

375
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,637
and all its flammable cousins
intimately. - What about us?

376
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,455
What, we do it? Are you fucking
nuts? Are you kidding me?

377
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,194
The guys that skimp are the
same guys that get caught.

378
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:54,775
They try to pull the job themselves,
they leave big bread crumb clues.

379
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:58,126
Any idiot first day fire investigator
can tell you the job is a rig.

380
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:00,771
Didn't you hear about Jerry Goldman?

381
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:05,057
I didn't know him that well. - He had
that little tittie bar over on Jefferson.

382
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:07,662
You know the one I'm talking about?
Six months ago it burns.

383
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,487
They go through it, you know what they
find? A little bag of charcoal briquettes...

384
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:15,431
halfassed hotwired with Dcell batteries
and some kind of gasoline trigger.

385
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,296
Isn't that funny? Needless to say, Jerry
now spends his days strolling C Block...

386
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:23,703
swinging off some fucking inmates
belt loop. You wanna end up like that?

387
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:26,876
I know you don't.
- So you've made up your mind?

388
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,582
I've made up my mind. I shouldn't
have to hit you over the head with it.

389
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:32,468
I think Ray's a bullshitter, too.
What do you want me to do?

390
00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:36,681
Because this is gone. And we
have nothing. We have nothing.

391
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:41,964
And you think it's worth it.
Assuming the cash end is solid...

392
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,648
you think it's gonna be worth whatever the
hell is waiting for us on the other end.

393
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,210
It beats the shit out of the
alternative. - Which is obvious.

394
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:52,509
Which is painfully etched in stone, sealed
in blood obvious. We do this or we fry.

395
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:00,444
Darling, I called in a
large burger and fries.

396
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:03,128
Why don't you slide on over
there and let me have a sit down.

397
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:07,212
Whatever. Who are you?
- Cash. Vernon Cash.

398
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,109
That's great, Vernon Cash. Where's Ray?
- Don't you go worrying about Ray.

399
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:13,750
Ray handled his shit. He got you
here. I'm the one you got to deal with.

400
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:17,460
#THE MAN IN BLACK#

401
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,961
You any relation to Johnny?
- No, it's kind of funny, though.

402
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:22,744
A buddy of mine fucked Johnny
Cash one time. - Come again?

403
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,536
A buddy of mine fucked Johnny Cash.
- There it is. - Would you like ketchup?

404
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,206
You got Tabasco.
That makes everything nice.

405
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:32,297
Johnny Cash. The man in
black. Johnny Cash. - The same.

406
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:37,423
When you say fucked, you mean, like what,
got over? - I mean like sodomy and shit.

407
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:40,574
My buddy was at Folsom, Johnny was at
Folsom. They bunked together, same cell.

408
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:44,472
Johnny Cash was not at Folsom in general
pop or anything. He was there as a performer

409
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:48,264
He was the block bitch. That's what my
buddy said. Cons be loving them song birds.

410
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:53,340
Your buddy had relations with
Johnny Cash. - Vern, listen up here...

411
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:58,120
Vernon, brother. That Vern shit
ain't happening. - All right, Vernon.

412
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,624
I don't wanna come out outright
and say your pal's full of shit...

413
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,055
But my mother, big Johnny
Cash fan, she passes it down.

414
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,515
I get an album collection, age
six, nothing but Johnny Cash.

415
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:13,450
"Ring of Fire," "I Walk the Line"...
"Forty Shades of Green,"

416
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:16,568
"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down."
Beautiful, moving ballads.

417
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:20,948
Fact remains, he was my partner's trick.
- Understand that by saying that,

418
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:25,109
you are not only slandering one of the
greatest folksingers of the last halfcentury

419
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:30,143
you are also pissing on a very sacred,
very cherished part of my childhood.

420
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:35,178
He wrote a song called "Folsom Prison Blues.
What'd you think made him so blue at Folsom?

421
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,896
Black and blue with that convict love.
- Are you backing this bullshit?

422
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:42,289
Let it go. You're a fan, leave
it at that. We know you're a fan.

423
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:47,025
Vernon's not passing judgment on Johnny Cash
- It's got nothing to do with being a fan.

424
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:51,271
It's a man's good name being dragged through
the mud. - I'm just stating it flat out.

425
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:54,462
When a motherfucker writes a
song called "A Boy Named Sue"...

426
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:58,425
you got to be wondering how he got the
inspiration to be writing that shit.

427
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,059
Johnny Cash was never jailed at Folsom.

428
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:04,250
Nor was he ever fucked by an inmate,
either figuratively or literally.

429
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:06,775
He's been married to his wife
June Carter Cash for years.

430
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:11,678
Having said that, let's just let it go.
- All right. Enough of this chitchat, anyway

431
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:15,756
Y'all listen up, 'cause what I got to
say is gonna be coming fast and furious,

432
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,677
I ain't gonna go repeating shit that's been
said already, so you best have your ears on.

433
00:32:19,988 --> 00:32:23,910
And what I do have to say has to be held
in the strictest motherfucking confidence.

434
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:27,431
You don't go repeating this to nobody,
not even the good lord himself, you dig?

435
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:32,187
I know Ray spooled some
shit to you about a car.

436
00:32:33,897 --> 00:32:36,380
That's a very important car, gentlemen.

437
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:39,868
It's a 1963 burgundy Pontiac
Le Mans convertible.

438
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:45,451
And its cash value to you is two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

439
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:49,390
To get that money, all y'all gotta
do is play valet a couple days.

440
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,602
Money don't come easier
unless you mint it yourself.

441
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:55,176
Wait a minute, I don't understand.

442
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:59,383
We park a car in our lot
for two days and that's it?

443
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:04,408
That's all. You save the farm just like that
This ain't no sales pitch bullshit neither.

444
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:09,744
I know you two are down, 'cause you wouldn't
be here if you weren't down for the dirt.

445
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:13,317
I'm gonna make my money whether
it's cut long ways or lengthwise.

446
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,972
Whether you take it or some other fool,
I don't care, I'm still getting paid.

447
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,629
We're taking the car. Here's my
concern. Wanna hear what's on my mind?

448
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:23,600
I don't care if it's you saying
it or Ray saying it or whatever.

449
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:26,381
If I see anything contrary
to what you said to me...

450
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,255
it constitutes a bullshit, null and void
deal. You understand what I'm saying?

451
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,957
Anything henkie and it's fucking off - Don't
sweat yourself, brother, it's all good.

452
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,767
I am gonna sweat.

453
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:40,205
Now that we got ourselves a little
arrangement, let me tell you something.

454
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,597
First, when the car arrives day
after tomorrow at twelve noon...

455
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:47,330
it will be under surveillance
for the rest of its stay.

456
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:50,158
What do you mean, under surveillance?
- I mean big, ugly men with big guns

457
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,733
looking at your ass.

458
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:56,879
And the trunk is going to be
wired, trunk and ignition to blow...

459
00:33:57,074 --> 00:34:01,448
So any attempt on your part to start
the car after it's been stopped...

460
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:04,225
or to open the trunk
after it's been parked...

461
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:09,695
there will be little pieces of your
jenky ass flying through orbit. You dig?

462
00:34:09,854 --> 00:34:14,263
You don't fuck with the car,
and the car don't fuck with you.

463
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:19,470
In the event of an absolute, end of the
world, fucked up, Armageddon emergency...

464
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:25,247
you call that number. Are we clear?
- We're solid. - Good.

465
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:28,752
#FLAME TO FUSE#

466
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:34,478
Come in. What do you got?
Forensics finally got around

467
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:39,388
to ID'ing the John Does from the
Drubb shootings. You all right?

468
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:42,143
This happens all the time. It's
just stress, nothing big. - You sure?

469
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,824
That's a lot of blood.
- It's nothing. Let me take a look.

470
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,860
The first three are strictly mercenary
material... low rent lifelong felons,

471
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:52,714
not much practical experience.
The fourth one's interesting.

472
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:58,611
Frank Manzano. - Three years
hazardous recon duty in the Marines.

473
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:02,586
Worked covert demolitions in Desert Storm.
Highly decorated, much maligned soldier.

474
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,195
Fought and drank recklessly.

475
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:07,869
He and another soldier wound
up beating their CO into a coma.

476
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:11,927
Dishonorably discharged two months
later. Charges filed, later dropped.

477
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:15,105
Who have you questioned? - I had
phone interviews with Charles Gordean...

478
00:35:15,242 --> 00:35:18,309
who went through boot camp with
Manzano at Paris Island. And Felix Hale,

479
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,559
head of Intelligence for the Corps.
- Alright. Paint me a picture.

480
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:25,707
According to Gordean, Manzano was
a short fuse with a mean streak...

481
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:30,755
and he traveled in kind.
Diaz Ortega Carbajal.

482
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:37,429
Cuban born, exiled to Freedom City, Miami,
age three, adopted, raised in South Beach.

483
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:40,858
So he was the other
soldier with Manzano.

484
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:46,458
Discharged one month after him.
According to Gordean,

485
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,959
they were inseparable
through boot camp and beyond.

486
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,872
I pulled this out of the classified.

487
00:35:55,788 --> 00:36:00,723
"One ace for a trigger, the
other makes the boom bigger"

488
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:05,311
"Sempre fi, eye for an eye,
make them die" Splended.

489
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,890
I traced the PO box listed back to Manzano.

490
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,944
So he's fielding black ops
offers, presumably with Carbajal.

491
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,739
This morning sheriff's
deputies found a '68 Mustang

492
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,560
deserted off a county access road
upstate. The interior was wiped clean,

493
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:23,455
no partials, nothing, but SDI matched the
blood spray on the exterior passenger door

494
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:28,337
to Priolo's. Type 0-positive, the exact
same blood type found on Manzanos forearm.

495
00:36:28,507 --> 00:36:32,539
Manzano is B-negative. Ballistic
results put Manzano behind the trigger.

496
00:36:32,688 --> 00:36:34,898
And Carbajal behind the wheel.

497
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:37,677
Which brings us to Mitchell Wayne
Richter and the red convertible.

498
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:40,952
What do you think?
- I think they killed Priolo for the car.

499
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:43,597
Ambushed him like they were
ambushed by the other four.

500
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:49,221
One party intercepts the other, they tangle,
shots are exchanged, Carbajal escapes...

501
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:53,098
but not before ramming the back of the
convertible into Richter, killing him.

502
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:58,302
That's patent plain right there.
Let's move off that assumption.

503
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:02,712
If Carbajal is alive and in possession of
that car, we need him locked down in a hurry

504
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:05,229
Give me a standard canvas,
discretionary searches.

505
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,613
Use the local Police Departments
and Sheriff's Departments.

506
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:10,703
Let them know this guy is A and D in
a big way, so brief them accordingly.

507
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:14,590
We get our hands on him, this whole things
gonna go from a simmer to a boil in a hurry.

508
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:38,272
#WHITE TRASH TRIGGER#

509
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:42,301
What did he say, noon?
Didn't he say noon? - What?

510
00:37:42,455 --> 00:37:46,699
What time did he say?
- He said noon. It's like ten after.

511
00:37:50,773 --> 00:37:55,564
You know, punctual is professional. - You're
this close to driving me nuts. Listen to me.

512
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:58,859
You're letting a man's opposing view
of Johnny Cash cloud your judgment.

513
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:01,837
Just relax.
- You know what I got right now?

514
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,952
I got that shit back that I haven't had
since Natalie left, that thing with my chest

515
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,850
I cannot believe you are so worked up
about this it's affecting your health.

516
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:18,011
It's fucking with me real bad.
It may turn out to be a real stroll,

517
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,908
but right now it's killing my ass.
- Take this shit. Drink. Shut up.

518
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,547
Just relax. They're due any second.

519
00:38:26,495 --> 00:38:30,882
Yeah. - Out on the lot, white LTD...

520
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:36,271
back seat, black case, get it.
Car gonna be there in five minutes.

521
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:43,566
Who was it? - I don't know. - Was it
Vernon? - I didn't recognize the voice.

522
00:38:43,706 --> 00:38:47,670
He said there's a black case
in the LTD. The car is coming.

523
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:51,483
The LTD, a black case... wait.
The car is on its way?

524
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:55,883
That's what he said. - This is not good.
Sid, this is not getting off good.

525
00:38:56,033 --> 00:39:00,232
Bob, relax. Drink that. Just relax,
I'll be back in a second. Sit tight.

526
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:15,379
B and S Auto. - Right side
one-one-two, left side three-nine-five.

527
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:19,142
Come on, what is this?
- Was it them?

528
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,621
Yes, it was them.
- What did they say?

529
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:26,398
I don't know. Something...numbers and
some other shit. I wasn't ready for it.

530
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,904
Numbers? This is a combination.
Did they give you the combination?

531
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:33,629
It's a combination lock. Can you
remember the numbers, the sequence?

532
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,517
What did they say? - He blew right through
them. I didn't have a chance to...

533
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:39,156
Perfect. - See?
This is how things get out of hand.

534
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:42,585
All this cloak and dagger bullshit.
- You have to listen!

535
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:46,341
Jesus Christ, these guys aren't gonna
fuck around. - Wait, wait a second...

536
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:53,253
They must be watching us. The phone
rang as soon as you hit the door.

537
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:57,414
They gotta be watching
us, man. Go signal them.

538
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,263
Let them know we didn't get the
combination. - All right, hang on.

539
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,632
Shit, what the hell are you doing?
This is gonna be fun.

540
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:17,282
I'm gonna take you down like a...

541
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:24,880
Shit! Fuck! Fuck! - Jesus! What
the hell! What the hell happened?

542
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,085
You're shot! Are you shot?
You're shot!

543
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:31,604
Don't pull me! Don't pull me!
Get the case! Get the fucking case!

544
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:39,951
You got the case? - Yeah. Oh, fuck...

545
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:43,513
Get that. Answer the phone. Forget
about me, just answer the phone.

546
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:47,201
Hello, B and S Auto...hello? - Another move
like that and the bullet's in his head.

547
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:51,562
Fuck you! What the... Hello?

548
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:55,725
It was them. - I know.
Help me to the bathroom.

549
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:58,364
They fucking shot you!
- Help me to the bathroom...

550
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:03,844
#SIDESWIPED#

551
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:10,280
Okay, get off me. I'm all right. Get
off me! Give me that bottle of peroxide.

552
00:41:11,963 --> 00:41:14,637
I can't fucking believe this!
- I gotta tourniquet my leg.

553
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,775
You want this? - No, just help
me tie this fucking thing off.

554
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:22,534
I can't believe they shot you!
- Help me tie this thing off.

555
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,323
They shot you, man!
- Not so fucking tight!

556
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:30,117
It's all right, listen to me.
I blew that, I fucked up.

557
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:34,167
Piss! God damn it,
does that fucking hurt.

558
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:39,497
Not so... don't fuck with it! - They shot
you, man! I can't believe they shot you!

559
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:43,823
Listen to me. I fucked
that up, I fucked that up.

560
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:48,592
I'm all right. - Have you gone fucking
insane? Jesus Christ, man...

561
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:52,645
These guys put a bullet in you!
- I'm ok. It doesn't hurt. Listen to me!

562
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,525
The legs are vascular. I got a
lot of blood in there. I'm fine.

563
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:00,629
Who are these people? They just
shoot a man... - It exited clean.

564
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:05,196
The situation is not as delicate
as we thought. I fucked up.

565
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:07,865
I shouldn't have been
waving so much. I blew that.

566
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:11,730
You know what? Forget the car.

567
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:16,593
Forget the goddamn car, 'cause we are
obviously way the fuck out of our league.

568
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,458
We are taking that car. I do not care what
it takes, we are taking that fucking car.

569
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:25,050
Sid! With guys like these, we
go any deeper than we are...

570
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:30,199
there's not gonna be any... These guys
do not wanna fucking powwow with us!

571
00:42:30,343 --> 00:42:34,841
All they understand is brute force.
- They're just letting us know. It's okay.

572
00:42:35,016 --> 00:42:38,082
Listen to me, Bob, listen carefully.
I am counting on you now

573
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:41,035
like I have never counted on you
before and I never will again.

574
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:44,404
Please, please calm down.
Listen to me.

575
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:47,878
Go out in the desk drawer.
In the desk drawer is a 38...

576
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,825
What the hell you doing with a...
- Just get it, Bob.

577
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:54,301
And get the case and bring it in here.
- Are you sure you're all right?

578
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:59,296
I'm all right. Please, just
go. I'm fine, Bob. I'm fine.

579
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:13,715
Just get me on my feet. - Are you
sure you're okay? - Yes. Watch the leg.

580
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:16,944
Hand me that, hand me that.
Turn that. Turn that thing.

581
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:20,116
Get back, get back.

582
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,350
It gets this good once.

583
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:42,273
Mr. Franklin, sir...

584
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:44,866
Go, Bob, 'cause they're coming.
- How do you know they're here?

585
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:47,367
Trust me, they're here. Are you all
right? - I'm all right. You all right?

586
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:50,707
I'm gonna wrap my leg.
Just go, I'm fine. - Tight.

587
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:37,426
Hi.

588
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:53,873
You have any gum?
Any type of mint?

589
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:59,623
I have Rolaids, Mylanta.
They're mint flavored.

590
00:45:23,828 --> 00:45:26,328
Are we good?
- He only gave me the ignition key.

591
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,431
That's the only key we're gonna need.
- Are you sure you don't need a hospital?

592
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:34,069
I'm fine. I wrapped it. It went
through clean, it just bled a lot.

593
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,953
The car looks good.
- Good. No problems with the guy?

594
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:46,275
Basic convertible, it looks fine.
So now what?

595
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:52,469
Now... let's get something to eat...
and sit back and see what happens.

596
00:45:53,366 --> 00:45:55,866
#COLDBLOODED HOTHEADS#

597
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:12,133
Ray? - No. - Get him.

598
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:17,487
Ray's not here. Let's try and
handle this like a pair of gentlemen.

599
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:20,209
Get Ray, get my money, get it now.

600
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,019
Ray has served his purpose
and has been dealt with.

601
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:28,245
No, there is no money. No, we never
intended on paying you that money.

602
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:31,677
What we intend is to kill
you and dispose of your body.

603
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:35,767
In this case are saws and other cutting
implements to assist me in that task.

604
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:38,405
That being said...

605
00:47:09,712 --> 00:47:12,811
#STICKER SHOCK#

606
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:18,624
We got caddies, and we got
coups and wagons and trucks.

607
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:23,156
All this and more for just a few bucks.
- Look at that shit. Unbelievable.

608
00:47:23,535 --> 00:47:26,035
Does that guy have it
tagged and bagged or what?

609
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,977
Did you talk to the IRS about him?
- They came by, day before last.

610
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:32,239
They came by to see me. Did
you burn him? - No. - You? - No.

611
00:47:32,374 --> 00:47:35,527
I could've handed him over cap and coat.
- For the shit with the Cadillacs.

612
00:47:35,661 --> 00:47:39,897
All that back door brokering he was
doing. Remember that fleet of Town Cars?

613
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:43,536
Came from wherever.
- Had them shipped up, paid shit for them.

614
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:49,469
Boot jacked cargo...come on, man. - Come
on down to Woo's Wild World of Resale!

615
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:53,361
Feeling charitable, I guess. - He owes us.
Whether he beats this audit or not,

616
00:47:53,362 --> 00:47:57,218
he's into us for the good load.
- Who cares about Danny Woo?

617
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,629
Reasonably, who cares about him?

618
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:03,507
We got a bag of money and no
place special to be. - Right.

619
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:07,842
How you feeling? - I'm feeling
good, man. I'm feeling real good.

620
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:11,344
Nothing a little Cutty and water can't
take the edge off of. I'm sore, but...

621
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:14,647
No big blood loss, a lot
of pain, lesson learned.

622
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,629
Now they know we won't fuck them.
- That remains to be seen.

623
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:23,100
What do you mean?
- Have you been thinking about this?

624
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:26,397
I've been thinking about Natalie, the
dealership... - Forget the dealership.

625
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:30,484
The dealership's dead.
As far as Natalie is concerned,

626
00:48:30,485 --> 00:48:34,494
she can't take you back with thousand in
your hand, she cannot take you back, chief.

627
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:37,404
I just wanna talk to her.
I get wistful with the booze,

628
00:48:37,405 --> 00:48:39,969
end up in a knockdown, drag out,
hate her guts all over again.

629
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,774
That's what women are
for. Look at Sylvia.

630
00:48:42,775 --> 00:48:45,862
She's wound tighter than
a two-dollar wristwatch.

631
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,477
I gotta go bark for bite with that bitch
every week, and for what?

632
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:51,858
That's anybody's guess. - I'm not saying
that all women are worldclass ballbreakers,

633
00:48:51,978 --> 00:48:54,716
But the vast majority... - They have the
potential. That's what I'm saying.

634
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,437
Put your finger on the one thing
that made Natalie walk. - I can't.

635
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:03,193
No, you couldn't possibly. Can I explain
Sylvia's vanishing act? I could try.

636
00:49:03,716 --> 00:49:06,626
But I'd be miles away
from any specific reason.

637
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:10,214
That's because women, they
fucking hoard, they tabulate. - Yes.

638
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:15,280
Some bullshit, snide comment... long
forgotten remark you made six years ago...

639
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:18,571
it has a shelf life with most women.

640
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:21,813
She's filing away a folder in her head
every time I fuck up, big or small.

641
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:26,076
Forget it. The defense rests. - In peace.

642
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:30,170
I think of how fucked it's been,
in general, you know, women.

643
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,774
Then I look at Danny Woo and see
how he dotes over that old girl.

644
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:36,343
That's pity, not to be confused with
love. She's a cripple, he's obligated.

645
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:40,809
No, no... - What did she crank out
for him, six, seven kids? - Eight, I think.

646
00:49:41,154 --> 00:49:44,278
So he dumps her ass, he's a fucking
heel, his business fishtails...

647
00:49:44,427 --> 00:49:47,182
his associates cast him out,
cut him off. For what reason?

648
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,046
It's smart management.
You hang on to her...

649
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:53,317
parade her through once in a while, show
everybody what a sweetheart you are...

650
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:57,033
That's bullshit. We both agree, Danny's
not the sharpest cat on the planet.

651
00:49:57,163 --> 00:50:00,141
You're confusing smart with savvy.
Danny's not textbook bright...

652
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,063
but he's got a shitload of panache,
showmanship. - He still loves his wife.

653
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:08,145
I don't know how you can't see that.
For that, I am envious.

654
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,028
I loved Natalie. I still love her right now,
this minute. - I know what you're saying.

655
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:15,028
Why do you think I keep
this strapped to my finger?

656
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:18,578
Hope springs eternal.
- Hope can spring as long as it likes.

657
00:50:19,077 --> 00:50:22,055
Natalie, like Sylvia, is gone for good.

658
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,475
We re gonna be two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars richer.

659
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:26,840
What kind of pay day would our
old ladies have offered up...

660
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:29,629
in lieu of a quarter million dollars?
- You're right.

661
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:33,349
I can't keep, you know...
- You beat yourself up.

662
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:36,278
"I could have done this if..."
You know what I'm saying?

663
00:50:36,448 --> 00:50:40,333
Now. That's the thing. You take it,
snatch it, seize it, grab it now.

664
00:50:40,506 --> 00:50:44,491
You flinch, it's blown. - It is.
- Hindsight, retrospect.

665
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:47,145
Everybody's brilliant looking back.
- 'Cause it's easy. - It is!

666
00:50:47,251 --> 00:50:49,986
And that's the only thing that taunts
you in the end. Not the things you did...

667
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:52,773
The things you didn't do.
- That's why we're doing what we're doing.

668
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:55,474
You need one reason, that's why. 'Cause
I don't wanna "what if" looking back.

669
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:00,807
On that note, permit me this hypothetical.
I've been thinking about this a little bit.

670
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:04,199
Cop shows up on the lot.
This is just "what if".

671
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:06,940
Cop shows up on the lot,
report of a stolen vehicle.

672
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,624
Looks a lot like that red
convertible you have over there.

673
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:14,007
Mind if I see the bill of sale... we
don have that. Mind if I see the title...

674
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:17,274
we don't have that either. Where's the
registration, your guess is as good as ours.

675
00:51:17,414 --> 00:51:21,842
Open the trunk...
- We can't 'cause it would explode.

676
00:51:22,543 --> 00:51:26,189
You're both under arrest for grand
theft auto, receiving stolen merchandise.

677
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:31,001
You have the right to remain,
etcetera... Listen to what I'm saying.

678
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:34,096
What are you saying?
- Keep your voice down.

679
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:38,325
I'm saying we have the car,
we act on that. - Act on it how?

680
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:42,175
This car gets laid on us, quarter
million, only half of which we've seen.

681
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:44,684
Day after tomorrow, somebody
shows up, pops the trunk.

682
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:48,147
Where did all this cocaine come from?
My god, theres a dead body in here.

683
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,542
Now you've got a possession
rap and a major murder beef

684
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:54,944
you couldn't beat on your best day.
Think about it.

685
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:58,470
No tags, no title, no bill of sale.

686
00:51:58,624 --> 00:52:01,792
This thing looks, feels and
smells like a fucking setup.

687
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:05,228
You're fucking nuts! Is this
speculative, are you speculating?

688
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:08,311
What is this? - I'm suggesting.
I'm offering a suggestion.

689
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,315
You're suggesting what? - We take
the car. - The Le Mans? Take it where?

690
00:52:11,473 --> 00:52:14,571
Take it, lift it, steal it, hijack it...
- For what purpose?

691
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,301
Ransom it back. - Ransom it back?
- What is this, connect the dots?

692
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:20,728
We take the car, we put a price on it, we
ransom it back. We run the table on them.

693
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,119
You wanna take what, from all
appearances, is a heads up gig...

694
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,121
You wanna take that and put an extortion
twist on it. Are you fucking nuts?

695
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:29,080
We took the ether on that lot,
something we really wanted.

696
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:31,654
We got sewn up and shut out,
now we're getting suckered.

697
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:34,155
How do you know we're getting suckered?
- Come here, come here.

698
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:38,617
You are letting that hole
in your leg dictate the shot.

699
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:41,054
You got some vendettarevenge combo
you wanna run, keep me the hell out.

700
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:45,337
You said you could still smell bullshit.
We got fallguy patsy stenciled all over us.

701
00:52:45,507 --> 00:52:48,047
Someone stickered us chumps. You wanna
sit tight and see what transpires?

702
00:52:48,253 --> 00:52:51,389
Who's fucking nuts now? - You knew
it was gonna come to this all along.

703
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:54,029
But the fact of the matter
remains... - we made a deal, Sid.

704
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:58,997
One that is neither binding now
permanent. Think about what I'm saying.

705
00:52:59,403 --> 00:53:03,024
The consequences if we sit still.
- Consequences which can double if we run.

706
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,723
I don't plan on spending the
rest of my life as tumbleweed.

707
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:08,482
This is a one shot thing. You have to ask
yourself, do you have the stomach for it?

708
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:12,317
Can we gut it out and make for ourselves
like we did when we started the lot?

709
00:53:12,571 --> 00:53:16,541
Fuck the lot, this is bigger than that.
- This whole thing is a big slice of voodoo.

710
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,104
It is what it is. Opportunity and nothing
more. To get it, you must take it now.

711
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:26,901
How do you know the car will start?
- 'Cause we have the key.

712
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:53,185
#DUMPSTER DU JOUR#

713
00:53:57,531 --> 00:54:01,509
What's the status on the room?
- It's clean. No latent prints, no spillage.

714
00:54:01,683 --> 00:54:04,332
SDI found traces of
cordite artifact in the rug.

715
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:09,182
It appears the victim was first
shot... and then dismembered.

716
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:11,904
What do you got? - Nothing for you.

717
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:14,567
What about the maid service, desk
clerk...anything? - Nothing but vagaries.

718
00:54:14,742 --> 00:54:18,541
Tall, blonde man, sunglasses.
Nondescript.

719
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:25,399
Okay, I got a right foot.
Removal was accomplished by a hacksaw

720
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,900
or some kind of general carpentry saw.

721
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:33,806
Victim's scalp seared off
by a hunting knife or a...

722
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:38,219
Excuse me, Mr. Sportcoat. You're gonna
have to take this business somewhere else.

723
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:41,131
You're killing me. What the
hell you got going on over there?

724
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:44,402
Are you the proprietor here?
- Right. My name is Milt Huggins,

725
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:48,700
owner-operator of Huggins Roadside Hacienda,
formerly known as Holiday AGoGo Inn.

726
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:52,272
Before I contact some sort of legal
service, which I do have a right to do...

727
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:55,255
I got a card here in my pocket. My associate
is a trial lawyer right here in town.

728
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:58,122
Before I do that, I just wanna
know what the hell's going on here?

729
00:54:58,246 --> 00:55:01,994
Mr. Huggins, right? - I'm Agent Jared,
this is Agent Littel. We're with the FBI.

730
00:55:02,187 --> 00:55:04,687
We're investigating a murder
scene here. Do you understand that?

731
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,781
I understand that.
But I'm the one you're killing here.

732
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:10,430
I'm in peak season here.
My hotel is full to capacity.

733
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:14,641
I understand your concern for your
business, but we cannot disturb this area.

734
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:18,138
If we do, we put the integrity
of the evidence here at risk.

735
00:55:18,263 --> 00:55:22,000
You do want to catch this guy? - I don't give
a frog's ass if you do catch this character.

736
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:24,625
All I know is I got a
hotel full to capacity.

737
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:27,210
I got people going down to the kidney
pool expecting a nice afternoon.

738
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,711
They run across some guy hacked to
hell, that reflects poorly on me.

739
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,930
We can appreciate that.
I tell you what we' re gonna do.

740
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:36,124
We're gonna try to conduct as
discreet an investigation as possible.

741
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:39,545
I got fingers! I got the left hand!

742
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:41,922
Get those fingers to SDI and
have them dusted for prints.

743
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:44,563
Get a hazmat crew out here
and remove that dumpster.

744
00:55:47,064 --> 00:55:49,715
Excuse me, sir, I'm terribly sorry.
These folks are federal agents.

745
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:52,099
They're gonna be done with their job
in just a minute. In the meantime,

746
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,556
we got complimentary beverages
and finger food down by the pool...

747
00:55:54,557 --> 00:55:57,197
we got backgammon, we got baccarat, and
competitive shuffleboard for the seniors.

748
00:55:57,331 --> 00:56:02,522
I got the head!
- Please enjoy your stay.

749
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:08,062
#THE BIG BUSTOUT#

750
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:17,117
Get down! Get your head down!
Do you see anything?

751
00:56:17,276 --> 00:56:20,558
Do you see any wire?
Start it, goddamn it, start it!

752
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,765
#REDNECK RECKONING#

753
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:23,633
Hi. I was just calling you.
- What happened?

754
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:31,397
We missed them.
- What's this "we" shit?

755
00:58:40,508 --> 00:58:43,000
#326 PM#

756
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:46,580
Outside of the severed limbs, this is the only
piece of saline evidence out of that dumpster.

757
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:51,111
This from Carbajal? - Yeah.
The killer sawed through the clothes,

758
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:55,294
tore it up quite a bit,
but we ran the number. - And?

759
00:58:56,081 --> 00:59:00,187
It belongs to a Raymont Phelps.
- Raymond? - No, Raymont.

760
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:04,684
We sent a unit over to the
house to question the landlady.

761
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:07,229
Said he was late with his
rent, chronically, in fact.

762
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,730
Last time she saw him two days
ago, he was with another guy.

763
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,143
You get a description on that?
- Who? - The guy he was with.

764
00:59:14,571 --> 00:59:17,274
Blonde, 6.1. - Blonde...

765
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:20,943
The desk clerk at the motel
rented 260 out to a blonde man.

766
00:59:21,173 --> 00:59:24,502
Anything else, specifics? Did you check
the place? - Yeah, it's clean, nothing.

767
00:59:26,116 --> 00:59:29,829
Witnesswise, what do we got? We got two
truckers that made Drubb at the El Matador.

768
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:32,827
We got one mechanic who
testified under oath.

769
00:59:32,828 --> 00:59:37,037
Room service slash housekeeping saw
Carbajal... blonde man, very nonspecific.

770
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:41,731
The only one who had contact...
- The mechanic.

771
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:46,196
Who says he A, knew nothing about the
car, and B, received no money from Drubb.

772
00:59:46,354 --> 00:59:49,180
That's testimony that runs completely
counter to the two freight drivers.

773
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,841
Somebody's not saying something.
- No, they're not.

774
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:56,440
Let's just dismiss Earle Ray Enteman's
testimony. - Who? - The mechanic.

775
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:59,884
Let's just assume it's diluted. - Which
it probably is. - Which it certainly is.

776
00:59:59,885 --> 01:00:03,875
He lies under oath... - On a sworn summons.
- On a sworn summons from the Grand Jury.

777
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:08,462
This is a man tiptoeing on a tightrope. And
he's risking a fullblown federal prosecution

778
01:00:08,658 --> 01:00:11,278
Why? - That's what we're gonna find out.

779
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:14,388
#GRAB BAG UGLY#

780
01:00:14,732 --> 01:00:17,399
What's the number we're
playing with here? - Four grand.

781
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:22,145
Four grand? You're looking under the
trunk, Bill. - It's very dirty under there.

782
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,624
That's a fucking gouge.
Just do it. That's fine.

783
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,182
#BILL'S AUTOMOTIVE 351 PM#

784
01:00:27,845 --> 01:00:30,882
How much? - Four grand. - What?
- Do you wanna do what he s doing?

785
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:35,540
Do you wanna crawl underneath there? It's
risk rates. This is hazardous duty pay.

786
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:38,406
And he's cool? You know him?
- I don't know him personally.

787
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:42,001
He's a friend of a friend. He's solid.
Don't worry about it. - Jesus Christ, Sid.

788
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:47,077
You guys got yourselves an hones to god
rolling warhead here, a powder keg on wheels

789
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:50,266
What's up? - Your number if
you fuck around with this.

790
01:00:50,415 --> 01:00:53,775
Your whole chassis, stem to
stern, is wired with C plastique...

791
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:59,062
molded along the transmission and
keyboxed at the end, probably the trunk.

792
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:03,185
Keyboxed, what's that? - It's like
a strongbox, takes a key to get in,

793
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:06,209
disarm whatever detonation
system you got there.

794
01:01:06,528 --> 01:01:10,299
Without a key and likely a coded sequence,
ain't nobody getting into this trunk.

795
01:01:10,444 --> 01:01:12,944
But the guy that dropped
it off, he popped the trunk.

796
01:01:12,955 --> 01:01:15,532
And he probably armed the fucking thing when
he shut it. - This is the real fucking thing

797
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:19,901
These people actually wired... Somebody
went to a hell of a lot of trouble.

798
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:22,526
Great pains to make sure
nobody tampered with this trunk.

799
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:26,085
Rather blow it than show it. - Looks
like it's counterweighted, NG based.

800
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,113
NG? - Nitroglycerine. - Beautiful.
We're tooling around in this thing...

801
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,348
with the most unstable compound known
to men, sloshing around. Fuck this.

802
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:38,602
Is it safe to drive? - Not likely.

803
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,336
You got enough boom under here to blow
this thing six or seven stories high.

804
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,152
How did you know it wasn't wired
into the ignition? - We didn't know.

805
01:01:45,304 --> 01:01:49,408
You are a pisser, aren't you?
- Can you do anything with it?

806
01:01:49,587 --> 01:01:52,498
Clip a wire, cut a fuse?
- Common sense.

807
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:56,661
Don't deny it and you ought not to defy it.
And common sense say simply, don't touch it.

808
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:05,881
Alright, Sid. We are in a bigtime pinch here
- Thanks for cueing me in on that.

809
01:02:07,451 --> 01:02:11,245
I am not anywhere remotely hipped
about driving around on top of a bomb.

810
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:14,794
How safe is it? I gotta get the
fucking car out. - You got it here.

811
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:19,180
Don't go over 40, treat it like your
greatgranny, you'll be all right.

812
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,830
That's not good enough.
It's not gonna be good enough.

813
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:24,111
We take a pothole, hit
a speed bump too hard...

814
01:02:24,112 --> 01:02:26,612
Why are you telling me
shit that I already know?

815
01:02:26,631 --> 01:02:31,949
Gentlemen, you got a problem here.
We got a big problem. - What, what, what?

816
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:35,727
You got some kind of leakage here.
- Where? Not from the trunk.

817
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:38,426
Yeah, from the trunk.
What kind of fluid is that?

818
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,208
This is blood!
- Bill, this is not...

819
01:02:44,215 --> 01:02:48,795
that is not fucking
blood. This is not blood!

820
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,101
You're overreacting.
This could be any number of things.

821
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:55,938
It's brown, for Christ's sake.
- Are you colorblind? It's red.

822
01:02:56,081 --> 01:02:59,968
It's not red. - This isn't tranny
fluid, it's not motor oil.

823
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:04,298
It's blood on my hand.
- It could be any number of things.

824
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:08,287
Don't pull that shit 'til we get this sorted
out. - There's a pool of it collecting...

825
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:12,827
Relax. Both of you, fucking
relax. It's not blood.

826
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:16,077
Jesus Christ, he says it's
blood, I say it's blood...

827
01:03:16,232 --> 01:03:19,366
it's fucking blood red in color,
and it looks exactly like blood.

828
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:22,325
How many more forms of ID
do you need? - So it's blood.

829
01:03:22,483 --> 01:03:25,389
We got Hiroshima strapped to this,
you're worried there's blood in the trunk?

830
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:28,237
Listen! - You gotta go.

#HUB BUB FOR VIC DRUB#

832
01:03:34,455 --> 01:03:38,186
I already filled out one of them
after Davids, so fuck you and David.

833
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,540
Mr. Enteman, the penalty for perjury in
a federally sanctioned investigation...

834
01:03:42,705 --> 01:03:45,097
will put you in Leavenworth for
the rest of your natural life.

835
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:47,598
Howdyho, hello to you,
too, Mister Motherfucker.

836
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:50,240
I hope you can appreciate
the gravity of the situation,

837
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:52,828
because you're going down a long, dark
road. You withheld on the Drub shooting.

838
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:57,395
I want to know what you omitted, right
here and now. - I told them all I know.

839
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:03,969
I was inside, I hear this bang, bang, bang,
I come out, Drubb's lying extra dead.

840
01:04:04,126 --> 01:04:08,226
This offer expired in the next sixty
seconds. I want the truth and nothing but,

841
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:12,447
only this time in its entirety.
Earle, I know the day-to-day.

842
01:04:12,576 --> 01:04:15,361
I got surveillance guys
catching all kinds of shit...

843
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:19,998
prostitution, meth sales, stolen shipment
swapping, I got weapons trafficking.

844
01:04:20,177 --> 01:04:23,919
I could go on, but the point
is, I got your country ass.

845
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,975
I got you dead to rights if I so desire.
If you wanna cooperate,

846
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:30,385
this whole file remains inactive.
You wanna play games with me,

847
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:33,138
we come back, bugles blaring...
I'm leading the charge.

848
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:37,793
Know that you have no other choice.
Was there a vehicle here?

849
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:42,008
If so, was Drubb here to
pick that vehicle up? - Yeah.

850
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:46,897
Elaborate. Make and model. - I don't
know...it was a GTO, a Le Mans.

851
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:51,506
You know what? It had a "for
sale" sign in the window. - For sale?

852
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:55,601
The guy gives me five grand, tells me
this cat named Vic is gonna show up.

853
01:04:55,753 --> 01:04:59,051
He'll add another three thousand to
the kitty if I just give him the keys.

854
01:04:59,183 --> 01:05:03,433
What guy? - The one who delivered the car.
Big dude, blonde. Big blonde motherfucker.

855
01:05:03,956 --> 01:05:06,398
Big, what, over six feet? - Yeah.

856
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:09,848
So he hands you the keys to the
car, some instructions, then what?

857
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:13,302
Then this slick, pimplooking,
bolotie Drubb shows up.

858
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:17,776
He doles out the cash, I deal him the
keys... I go inside. You know the rest.

859
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:27,375
Friday, 4:29 p.m. Regarding
the incidental evidence

860
01:05:27,528 --> 01:05:31,097
surrounding the Drubb-Priolo shootings...
After reinterviewing Earle Ray Enteman...

861
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:34,255
I have determined that the
original witness testimony

862
01:05:34,256 --> 01:05:36,963
was inaccurate. Now Enteman
revised previous testimony...

863
01:05:37,138 --> 01:05:40,223
and made another link to our
unidentified blonde suspect.

864
01:05:40,397 --> 01:05:43,888
It's my belief that the blonde man is
intrinsically linked to all the murders.

865
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:48,431
I think he's hiring career criminals
and turning them on one another.

866
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,530
This is all to encumber
any ensuing investigations.

867
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:54,851
And I also believe that this man
is covering for someone else...

868
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,527
because he simply
cannot be working alone.

869

#GUTCHECH#

In the event of an absolute, end-of-the-
world, Armageddon, fucked up emergency...

871
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:16,836
you call that phone number.
- Who's this?

872
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:20,300
Vernon, my man.
Cash money man Vernon.

873
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:23,390
Sid, you are one dead
bitch, you understand me?

874
01:06:23,534 --> 01:06:27,004
I'm not gonna talk to you
when you're acting like this.

875
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:29,707
We have the car. - You do?
- Yes, we have the car.

876
01:06:29,762 --> 01:06:33,011
I know you ain't this motherfucking
stupid! - Vernon, listen to me.

877
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:35,820
I'm gonna hang up the goddamn...

878
01:06:44,678 --> 01:06:49,241
Hello? Who's this? Who is this?

879
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:53,252
Hold on just a second.

880
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:59,562
Who is this? - This is the guy that just
put two slugs into the former Vernon Cash.

881
01:06:59,734 --> 01:07:02,297
Where is my car?
- Listen to me very carefully,

882
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:05,680
'cause the line is going dead in 10 seconds.
You understand me? The line goes dead.

883
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:09,234
Five hundred thousand dollars to get the car
back in any kind of salvageable condition.

884
01:07:09,374 --> 01:07:13,225
You meet me out Route near the reactors.
If you don't know where it's at, find out.

885
01:07:13,399 --> 01:07:17,968
You understand me? I hope you're
listening to me. End of call.

01:07:31,261 --> 01:07:34,236
You know what? This is everything bad.
This is all the wrong we have ever done.

888
01:07:34,365 --> 01:07:37,326
I've been listening to you
for the last hour. I'm done.

889
01:07:37,494 --> 01:07:40,159
I'm done hearing that shit.
- This is fucking weird.

890
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,690
The last two days have been nothing
but how bad it is. I'm tired of it.

891
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:47,101
This is fucking weird. - What? - I just had
a dream about this fucking place.

892
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:51,686
You know, that's wonderful.
- You know what? You died at the end.

893
01:07:52,478 --> 01:07:56,843
It's fucking weird. I don't like this.
- Why the fuck would you tell me that?

894
01:07:56,988 --> 01:07:59,809
Why would you say that to me now?
- It was a dream.

895
01:07:59,963 --> 01:08:03,164
I don't give a shit if it was a dream.
Why would you say that to me?

896
01:08:04,178 --> 01:08:08,338
I had a dream. - Do me a favor.
You've totally lost composure.

897
01:08:08,516 --> 01:08:11,663
The last two days have been a joke.
Do me a favor.

898
01:08:12,545 --> 01:08:16,152
Shut up, or say something that
makes sense. Do one or the other.

899
01:08:16,748 --> 01:08:20,801
It's getting old. It's getting
really old. Get your act together.

900
01:08:26,865 --> 01:08:29,706
#DOUBLE BARRELED DOOMSDAY#

901
01:09:15,588 --> 01:09:19,330
You the guy that I spoke with?
- I am he, yes.

902
01:09:19,445 --> 01:09:24,836
You're good? You understand the gist,
the upshot of what we're doing here?

903
01:09:25,022 --> 01:09:30,144
What? - You know what I'm talking about.

904
01:09:30,363 --> 01:09:33,219
Are you sure you're the guy I talked to?
- I'm the guy, yes.

905
01:09:33,363 --> 01:09:35,876
Where's that commanding phone presence?
- The money, the extra money.

906
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:39,912
Did you bring the extra money? I want
the money. - No. - What do you mean, no?

907
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:45,753
What, no? It was you and I that talked
on the phone. - I was aware of that.

908
01:09:46,157 --> 01:09:50,397
The contract called for thousand down,
remainder on delivery of the vehicle.

909
01:09:50,572 --> 01:09:54,000
There were no revisionary clauses
concerning theft and ransom of said vehicle.

910
01:09:54,135 --> 01:09:57,201
You broke the contract. - Forget it.
We're not talking about the contract.

911
01:09:57,355 --> 01:09:59,947
Bob. - Now what are you doing?

912
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:02,607
Listen to me, five hundred
thousand dollars right now...

913
01:10:02,608 --> 01:10:06,031
or me and this guy behind me take you
down dead. You understand me, right now.

914
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:10,467
I did not bring half a million dollars with
me. In fact, I didn't bring any money at all

915
01:10:10,601 --> 01:10:12,982
We forfeited the balance
when you fled with the car.

916
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:15,439
Get your buddy. I wanna see
him. Get him out of the car.

917
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,999
Get him out of the fucking car right now.
- I can see that we're reaching an impasse.

918
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:24,544
And frankly, I don't feel all that well.
I'd like to get out of here,

919
01:10:24,545 --> 01:10:27,398
go home and take a shit.
So here's the situation.

920
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,996
You, neither of you, have ever
killed a man. I'd venture to say,

921
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:36,311
no matter how extraordinary the
circumstances, right now included...

922
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:38,972
you're both too morally
inclined for murder.

923
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:44,264
Your friend Ray, I shot him sixteen times
and poured quick dry cement down his throat.

924
01:10:44,568 --> 01:10:47,746
Vernon, you heard what happened
to Vernon. But after I reloaded

925
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:51,161
and shot him again, I doused him
with propane and roasted his corpse.

926
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:54,204
The guy who delivered your car?
Cut him up digit for digit,

927
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:56,844
then decorated a dumpster
with what was left.

928
01:10:57,138 --> 01:11:00,216
This is the work of a guy with
no ethical attachments at all.

929
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:03,963
A silly, screwy guy.
Now, if you don't mind...

930
01:11:04,113 --> 01:11:07,495
What are you doing? Don't do
that. - It's okay, it's all right.

931
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:10,148
It's not okay, it's not all right.
Put the gun away.

932
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:13,898
It's all right, don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen. - Bob! Bob!

933
01:11:14,028 --> 01:11:17,892
You don't shoot on a regular basis, you're
not gonna hit anything over 20 feet away.

934
01:11:18,102 --> 01:11:20,842
I can get both of you from right
here in about half a second.

935
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,091
I'm just trying to help you out now.
- Give me the money right now!

936
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:50,349
Dan? What... what?

937
01:11:53,427 --> 01:11:58,558
Kiddo, my profound apologies.
I'm very, very disappointed.

938
01:11:59,156 --> 01:12:01,656
It should have been handled differently.

939
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:08,046
I know Sid. In all
fairness, he's blind greedy.

940
01:12:09,099 --> 01:12:11,958
He played this thing
with epic stupidity.

941
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,997
This was a standup arrangement
he personally shot to hell.

942
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:22,824
What is this? You don't sound like...

943
01:12:22,993 --> 01:12:28,244
A cornball car hustler extraordinaire?
No, that's a public face, a bit player.

944
01:12:28,403 --> 01:12:34,215
Dan, what is this? Sid is dead.
I mean... - It's very involved, Bob.

945
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,159
You know my wife.
She has a condition.

946
01:12:39,975 --> 01:12:42,717
You already know she's very
ill, has been for some time.

947
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:46,121
Bad blood, diseased, infected.

948
01:12:46,276 --> 01:12:48,776
Heart pumps poison through
her system at all hours.

949
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:54,080
I have exhausted every means of modern
medical technology in an effort to cure it.

950
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,720
Nothing.

951
01:12:57,096 --> 01:13:01,469
Now, I have friends...
connections, far and wide.

952
01:13:01,623 --> 01:13:05,428
Some time ago, word reaches me,
a native tribe in Equador...

953
01:13:05,593 --> 01:13:08,703
A small indigenous tribe called
the Machu Picu was slaughtered.

954
01:13:08,857 --> 01:13:12,771
...rumors, myths their blood
is blessed, supercharged.

955
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:17,891
Something about the mountain air.
No history of cancer, plaguefree.

956
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:20,967
The elders live to be, 110-120 years old.

957
01:13:22,929 --> 01:13:28,267
I receive a pint, a transfusion
for my wife. Instantly she responds.

958
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:33,192
She's up, moving around under her
own power... spirits lifted, laughing.

959
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,452
I hadn't seen my wife
laugh in six years.

960
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:46,232
It lasts for a month... then she's back
to bedridden, meals through straw status.

961
01:13:47,663 --> 01:13:51,035
I try to secure more
blood, am flatly denied.

962
01:13:51,203 --> 01:13:56,156
I pour money into the offer by the bushel. I
plead, I grovel, just shy of shedding tears.

963
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:58,853
imploring the tribal
heads to reconsider.

964
01:14:00,572 --> 01:14:05,018
I offer them every worldly possession
I own in exchange for their help.

965
01:14:06,047 --> 01:14:10,268
They refuse my every entreaty.
They spite me.

966
01:14:10,782 --> 01:14:16,577
And they hold the fate of my wife
of 43 years in their third world grasp.

967
01:14:18,031 --> 01:14:21,917
Each of the victims was bled, almost
to the point of being drained dry.

968
01:14:22,109 --> 01:14:25,589
So arrangements are made, men are hired.

969
01:14:25,734 --> 01:14:29,645
I don't hire salesmen...
I hire hitmen.

970
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:39,297
Thugs, crooks, mercenaries. Mr. Reich
over there handles the contracts.

971
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:46,436
Goon squad versus peaceful mountain
village. The entire tribe is slaughtered.

972
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:52,465
Their blood is spilled,
bottled, and shipped back to me.

973
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:00,391
I wish it could have been
prevented...it couldn't.

974
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:03,369
Dottie would never have
condoned any of this.

975
01:15:03,559 --> 01:15:06,059
She grew up with strict,
Protestant parents.

976
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:12,414
You had people killed so your wife...
Blood for your wife?

977
01:15:12,871 --> 01:15:16,102
Dan, you're responsible...
- It's a hitandrun world. Savage.

978
01:15:16,483 --> 01:15:19,871
Swallow you whole, spit out the bones.
You gonna draw a line

979
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:22,884
on what you would or wouldn't do for
someone who meant the world to you?

980
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:26,814
There are still things
in this life, Bob...

981
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:30,345
things that are
unbreakable, vows, promises.

982
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:35,318
My family is the only
thing that matters to me.

983
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,066
'Cause when it's all said and done
and your business is dead and buried...

984
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:43,725
it's only your family that cares if you live
or die. Everybody else is a Christmas card.

985
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:49,024
The thought of me without her, the
children without their mother...

986
01:15:49,196 --> 01:15:51,696
was a thought I didnt want to think.

987
01:15:53,151 --> 01:15:58,430
I love my wife more than I will ever
be able or ever care to put into words.

988
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:03,450
And with that love comes
complete commitment.

989
01:16:04,499 --> 01:16:08,517
So if I'm required to pistol-whip
the Pope on her behalf...

990
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:11,584
then the Papal robes are
running red, make no mistake.

991
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:14,607
'Cause I'm in it to win it.

992
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:19,988
I've been selling cars for almost forty
years. That's not where I made my money.

993
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:31,128
Agents from the ATF and the Drug Enforcement
Agency have been tracking an elusive

994
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,312
and very lucrative smuggling
operation for the past ten years now.

995
01:16:35,393 --> 01:16:38,540
I've done enough bad shit in my day
to land me in the hottest spot in hell.

996
01:16:38,698 --> 01:16:42,659
If that's where I'm headed, so be it. I
don't know hell. It's not tangible to me.

997
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:46,356
When I kiss my wife, that is,
and that's all I wanna know.

998
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:50,405
And heaven? I'm a punishable soul,
a sinner in every sense of the word.

999
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:53,270
But since the only redemption
I've ever sought in my life...

1000
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:56,626
was on cash back dealer
incentives and factory buybacks...

1001
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:01,218
which the big three in their
divinity always grant...

1002
01:17:01,891 --> 01:17:04,857
my afterlife status is unimportant.

1003
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:12,049
Mr. Reich, heaven or hell, any thoughts?
- They're both overrated.

1004
01:17:12,191 --> 01:17:14,691
I agree wholeheartedly.

1005
01:17:26,383 --> 01:17:29,888
I'm no better than any of them.
Never was, never will be.

1006
01:17:30,052 --> 01:17:33,225
Why did you do this to us?
- You helped me, I tried to help you.

1007
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:38,195
The audit... I will be making
good on this, Bob, believe it.

1008
01:17:38,315 --> 01:17:42,097
If you'd have just sat on the car you would
have been fine. I had the IRS all over me.

1009
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:45,322
I couldn't take delivery with the federal
government camped out on my doorstep.

1010
01:17:45,473 --> 01:17:48,328
So the car was a gift?
- You read into it.

1011
01:17:48,566 --> 01:17:52,527
You thought it was a setup.
It wasn't... this is.

1012
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:55,825
What do you mean? - We have a trunk
full of stolen drugs, contraband.

1013
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:58,810
But you just put that there.
- I did?

1014
01:17:59,825 --> 01:18:03,470
You got a dead partner who exchanged
bullets with a dead mercenary.

1015
01:18:03,604 --> 01:18:06,009
You got a closed case,
blood simple murder scene.

1016
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:08,510
And you, kiddo, have
earned fugitive status.

1017
01:18:08,606 --> 01:18:11,623
You can't explain any of this, you
can only run from it. - It's a frame, Dan!

1018
01:18:11,766 --> 01:18:15,430
I'm telling you, it is
this and nothing more.

1019
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:20,579
Are you gonna turn me in?
I'm handing you a clean slate.

1020
01:18:20,723 --> 01:18:23,541
The Camaro over there, it's
yours, it's unregistered.

1021
01:18:23,695 --> 01:18:26,195
We're two hundred and sixty
miles from the Mexican border.

1022
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,959
The remaining hundred and twenty
five thousand is in the trunk.

1023
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,513
Are you gonna turn me in?
- It wouldn't make. It wouldn't wash.

1024
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,031
They'd never believe... - No, they wouldn't.
I know I've given you reason.

1025
01:18:36,186 --> 01:18:38,686
Maybe I destroyed your
business, maybe I meant it.

1026
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:41,983
Maybe I've given you this
chance all along, maybe not.

1027
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:45,214
It doesn't matter now. I'm a bad guy.

1028
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,836
That's my cross to bear.
I'm only sorry about Sid.

1029
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:55,578
The rest...the rest are
fading into forgotten.

1030
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:09,138
I'm going home now. Good life
to you, kiddo. You deserve it.

1031
01:19:53,157 --> 01:19:56,534
#EPILOGUE#

1032
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:09,716
Fiftysix pounds of unprocessed,
Bolivian cut cocaine...

1033
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:16,452
recovered from the trunk of one
1963 Pontiac Le Mans convertible.

1034
01:20:21,165 --> 01:20:26,101
Two dead. One, tall, blonde,
ponytail, pending identification.

1035
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:32,024
The other, Sidney J. French, twentynine.
Ran a now defunct auto dealership.

1036
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:37,636
He had a partner, Robert Douglas
Melba, thirtyone... unaccounted for.

1037
01:20:38,651 --> 01:20:41,151
He is still at large.
