1
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,124
Oh shit!

2
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,692
* Voice on the breeze

3
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,362
* You're singin' to me

4
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:06,300
* Told me everything about
the way the world should be *

5
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,637
* Stories of lights

6
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,072
* Across a giant sea

7
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:16,910
* Truths to discover
and the means to be free *

8
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:21,282
* And I know that
we will never know *

9
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:26,687
* How the world keeps
going how it goes *

10
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,958
* And all this time we spent

11
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,495
* Waiting for our
lives to happen *

12
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,031
* Is time that's been wasted

13
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:42,836
* While the world keeps
moving and changing *

14
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,277
* I've said my goodbyes

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,912
* So there's no turning back

16
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:56,717
* Keep singin' this melody
to keep my heart in tact *

17
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,255
* Now the world keeps
goin' how it goes *

18
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,523
Breakfast.

19
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,559
Pancakes?

20
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:09,397
Uh no, crepes
with strawberry jam.

21
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,664
Yay!

22
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,469
But you
didn't know for sure

23
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,605
that you were adopted
until you were 63.

24
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,706
That's right.

25
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,873
Gram,
we're leaving!

26
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,509
Not 'til after my
parents were dead.

27
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,877
Give the cat
some food before you go.

28
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,112
We got a cat?

29
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,214
No, come on.

30
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,450
* All this time we spent

31
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,986
* Waiting for our
lives to happen *

32
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,726
* This time has been
wasted while the world *

33
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,530
- * Keeps moving and changing
- Sam, I know you're in there.

34
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,266
Sam!

35
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,270
* And all this time
we've spent *

36
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,573
* Waiting for our
lives to happen *

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,646
* It's time that's been wasted

38
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,748
* While the world keeps

39
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,452
- * Moving and changing
- Sam?

40
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:11,325
* And I know that
we will never know *

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:17,197
* How the world keeps
going how it goes *

42
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:21,402
* And I know that
we will never know *

43
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:27,675
* How the world keeps
going how it goes *

44
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,656
Okay, we know how to fly.

45
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,091
Come on, come on, enough.

46
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,929
You don't think
I see you, Scout Havers.

47
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,899
You enroll Tallulah
in school yet?

48
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,567
It's complicated.

49
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,835
It's not complicated.

50
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,036
It's public school.

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,838
You fill out a
form, they take you.

52
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,573
She really likes it here.

53
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,309
This
is a daycare center

54
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,976
for two to four year olds.

55
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,244
She is four.

56
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:08,048
If Tallulah is four,
I am the Queen of Shiba.

57
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,584
And I don't see no crown
sittin' on top of my head.

58
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,486
Just for today, please.

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,021
No, some of the
other parents have been

60
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,923
calling and complaining.

61
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,426
I'm sorry. You have to go.

62
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,893
Come on, Lulu.

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,436
This is the window to
your bathroom, right?

64
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,103
Yep.

65
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,906
Okay, so just go
in and open the door

66
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,342
and into your class, okay?

67
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,910
Okay. Am I
going to get into trouble?

68
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,479
No, you're gonna be fine.

69
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,647
But when you're done,

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,566
instead of going
out into the hall,

71
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,749
just come back here, okay?

72
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,535
Okay.

73
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,651
Love you, Lulu.

74
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,319
You too, Scout.

75
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,325
The sea otter was
almost hunted to extinction,

76
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,362
their trusting nature
making them an easy target

77
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,563
for the fur traders.

78
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,297
Doctor Arginow says
that you absolutely

79
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,833
must go to a real
treatment center.

80
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,803
I suppose you could
always go to Mclarence.

81
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,807
Pigeon.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,577
It's a mental institute,
not a boarding school.

83
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,945
They're used to
people behaving badly.

84
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,550
The food's horrendous
there though.

85
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,952
Some devoted
mothers have been known

86
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,254
to carry their pups for days,

87
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,290
even after they have died.

88
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,527
Of course, we could
try something different.

89
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,463
The Doctor thought you
might like Prosper.

90
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,666
Your father really
loved it there.

91
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,841
New York
passenger, Sam Prescott,

92
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,211
please meet your party at
the baggage claim area.

93
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,114
A Mr. Prescott,
please meet your party

94
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,483
at the baggage claim area.

95
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,951
Mr. Prescott?

96
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,555
Mr. Prescott?

97
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,581
Mr. Prescott!

98
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,051
* We are skin and bone

99
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,891
* We are skin and bone

100
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,465
* We are skin and bone

101
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,573
We're supposed to
paint our feelings.

102
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,478
Fantastic.

103
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,170
Why can't I
go to school any more?

104
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,339
Is it cause of the
goldfish thing?

105
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,074
What goldfish thing?

106
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,510
I told you.

107
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,979
Ms. McGintey got mad cause
I was petting the gold fish.

108
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,447
You didn't tell me that.

109
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,983
You stuck your hand
in the goldfish bowl?

110
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,485
No stupid.

111
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,086
You can't pet them in the bowl.

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,387
They don't stay still.

113
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,823
You gotta take em out.

114
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,991
Fish die without water Lulu.

115
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,092
Duh.

116
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,832
Scout, what's that guy doing?

117
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,505
Trying to escape
from the looney bin.

118
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,674
But he's not going anywhere.

119
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,777
Don't tell him that.

120
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,542
If they catch you, they're gonna

121
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,024
give you a lobotomy.

122
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,362
They stopped doing
lobotomies in the 1980's.

123
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:19,266
Toto, I don't think
he's been to Texas before.

124
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,968
Can we eat now?

125
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,071
Are you okay?

126
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,775
Yeah. I'm just
waitin' for it to rain.

127
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,480
I bet you know how
to make it rain.

128
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,083
People don't make
it rain, silly.

129
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:40,888
No. People make cookies.

130
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,626
Sorry, that was kinda weird.

131
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,565
Yeah well, you
don't wanna end up

132
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,333
on my side of the fence.

133
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,042
They're not poisoned.

134
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,081
Uh oh. Busted.

135
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,287
Prescott.

136
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,859
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

137
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,861
Now, if you'd read
your rule book,

138
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,697
you'd know these
woods are off limits.

139
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,667
And fraternizing with
strangers is strictly forbidden.

140
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,636
Page 65.

141
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:29,788
Go ahead.

142
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,404
Okay, Mr. Prescott.

143
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,242
Next time, let's go
some place it rains.

144
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,275
Let's go.

145
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,677
Prescott.

146
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,386
That cookie,
Prescott. Spit it out!

147
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,759
My
guest today, Tammy,

148
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,261
had a tumor that grew, now
you're not gonna believe this,

149
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,764
to 275 pounds.

150
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,465
Yes, you heard me correctly.

151
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,469
A 275 pound tumor before
she called the doctor

152
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,404
and when the ambulance
finally did arrive

153
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,974
to pick her up, well
they needed one for her

154
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,676
and one for her leg.

155
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,744
Now, Tammy, I gotta ask you,

156
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,345
why didn't you call the doctor?

157
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,648
I think like
anyone, I was scared.

158
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,049
Scared that they might...

159
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,552
Hey, I
was watchin' that.

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,990
We need to get a birth
certificate for Lulu.

161
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,192
Oh no, I'm not
havin' any of those

162
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,761
busy body bureaucrats
stickin' their nose

163
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,897
in my business, no way.

164
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,631
Well, I need to enroll
her in public school

165
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,867
and I can't without
a birth certificate.

166
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,969
I thought she liked daycare.

167
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,338
She's too old for daycare.

168
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,373
She has to go to
real school now.

169
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,342
So, send her to school.

170
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,377
But I just told you, I can't

171
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,213
without a birth certificate.

172
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,050
If Lulu doesn't go to
school, I can't either.

173
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,451
Well, sure ya can.

174
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,653
Just leave her at
home here with me.

175
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,089
What?

176
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,624
I raised four kids in this house

177
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,693
before you were even born.

178
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,163
Gram, you had two children.

179
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,499
Hmm, well,

180
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,335
felt like four.

181
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,612
Some more tea?

182
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,550
You got it all
over my new dress!

183
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,352
How is it new? You've
been wearing it for five...

184
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,586
Hey Lulu, I gotta run,

185
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,221
but I'll be back at noon
to check on you, okay?

186
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,656
Wait, Scout!

187
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,026
Me and King Bochi
don't have any cakes.

188
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,895
Well, you and King
Bochi must be blind.

189
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,096
There are plenty of cakes.

190
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,264
Don't you see em?

191
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,101
Okay, love you Lulu!

192
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,537
Sorry about my
sister, your heiness.

193
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,706
She's a little.

194
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,843
There's gotta be
cakes here somewhere.

195
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,148
What else can I do ya for?

196
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,085
I'll have an oreo milkshake

197
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,555
with rainbow sprinkles
and green gummies.

198
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,023
You got it.

199
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,592
Sorry about the weather.

200
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,963
Guess you should have picked
a looney bin in Seattle.

201
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,233
Killer shoes though.

202
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,207
You seem to normal
to be at Prosper.

203
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,113
You've caught
me on a good week.

204
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,218
There ya go. Anything else?

205
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,954
Not unless you've got a
pepto bismol I can bum.

206
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,655
I don't think so.

207
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:51,031
Shit, I gotta run.
Thanks for lunch!

208
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,066
Hey, wait!

209
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,767
My boyfriend'll pay.

210
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,404
But
that's not a to-go cup.

211
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,741
Lulu!

212
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,710
I brought you a milkshake.

213
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:06,947
Lulu?

214
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,517
Gram?

215
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,587
Are you playing hide and seek?

216
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,593
Lulu?

217
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,196
I'm gonna find you.

218
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,466
King Bochi and I
are gonna find you.

219
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,442
Lulu? Lulu?

220
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,810
Lulu, you have to come out now.

221
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,512
It's not funny any more.

222
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:42,749
Lulu!

223
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,885
Hey, come here.

224
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,126
That kid's still here?

225
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,894
Yeah, I've been
calling the number

226
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,229
she gave us all night.

227
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,698
No answer. No machine.

228
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,600
You want me to
call child welfare?

229
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,435
Nah, I'll go talk to her.

230
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,710
Is she okay?

231
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,980
We had to pump her
stomach, but she'll be fine.

232
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,515
We've been calling that
number that you gave us

233
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:16,984
to talk to your family.

234
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,651
But no one's answering.

235
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,820
We've been staying
with my great grandma.

236
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,923
I'm sure she's there but,
you know how old people are.

237
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,677
Once she's asleep, I don't think

238
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,694
an atomic bomb would wake her.

239
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,997
Well tomorrow, we
need a parent here

240
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,098
when we release her.

241
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,133
And someone to make payment.

242
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,419
Not a problem.

243
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,468
Okay.

244
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,657
See, so this is
what they used to do.

245
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,559
They'd be buried under there.

246
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,195
Like in the middle of there.

247
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,066
Oh, so everyone
would have to walk around it?

248
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,167
Mmhmm!

249
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,968
Egyptian boys and girls

250
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,704
wore their hair in a
style called sidewalks.

251
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,406
Nobody knows why.

252
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,276
Hey, how long do
you think that guy's

253
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,910
been sitting over there?

254
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,916
Here. Be back in a second.

255
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,892
So, are you a cop or a perv?

256
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,564
Bureau of child welfare.

257
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,201
Guess that makes
you a bit of both.

258
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,802
Are your parents at home?

259
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,671
My Dad's at work.

260
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,440
What time do you
expect him back?

261
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,711
Is there anyone over the
age of 18 I can speak to?

262
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,314
My great grandmother,

263
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,883
but I doubt she's gonna
wanna talk to you.

264
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,224
Dial the number.

265
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,727
There must be another way.

266
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,362
Yeah, there is.

267
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,764
You go to foster care.

268
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,267
Aren't you the one that's
saying the government

269
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,187
should stay out of it...

270
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,437
Dial the number, Scout.

271
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,943
Will you dial the
f'ing number please?

272
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,380
Hello?

273
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,132
Ray, it's Mary.

274
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,133
Hey.

275
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,453
You comin'?

276
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,756
Who's that?

277
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,300
Trouble.

278
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,403
So, you gonna take em?

279
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,972
He doesn't need to take us.

280
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,274
All he has to do is
put an appearance

281
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,709
at BCW and it'll be fine.

282
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,778
Scout, will you give
us a moment alone here?

283
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,780
Look, I know you don't
wanna take us, okay?

284
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,548
You can say it to my face.

285
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,817
Do you want my help?

286
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,587
Let me talk to your
grandma alone for a minute.

287
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,461
You're gonna take em right?

288
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,529
Come on, for Christ sake.

289
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,697
Mary, I'm...

290
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,470
I'm a f'in carnie, ain't
no way to raise a kid.

291
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,873
It's a little late for that.

292
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,976
Or are you gonna
abandon this one too?

293
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,014
What was that joke Janie
used to like to tell?

294
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,316
What do ya get when
ya put 20 carnies

295
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,717
in a room together?

296
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,185
A full set of teeth.

297
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,889
She loved to tell that joke.

298
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,392
Can we stay focused here?

299
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,993
He's got A.D.D.

300
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,430
Is that what ya call it?

301
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,634
This smells pretty.

302
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,910
They give you money and
food stamps and stuff

303
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,879
for takin' care
of em, don't they?

304
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,914
Every month.

305
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,149
I know a guy who will buy

306
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,051
food stamps for cash.

307
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,086
Maybe this way, we can afford

308
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,456
that nice apartment you keep
promising me for the winter.

309
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,623
You couldn't pay
me a million dollars

310
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:51,691
to live in a 10
by five shit hole

311
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,360
with a moody teenager.

312
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,094
Can't breathe as it is.

313
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,530
Well maybe we could
just take the little one.

314
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,734
She don't need much room.

315
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,519
Hey, I want you
to run to the store

316
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,755
and get your Gram a Coke.

317
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,691
She ain't gonna drink it

318
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,192
unless you got some
rum to put in there.

319
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,127
Do you ever do
what you're told?

320
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,662
Depends who's
doin' the tellin'.

321
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,030
Um, your father.

322
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,465
The only fathering
you ever did

323
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,933
was gettin' my Mom knocked up.

324
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,103
Sorry, I don't think that's
much of a parenting skill.

325
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,705
Lulu, come here.

326
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,541
Go to the store. Get a Coke.

327
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:45,978
You gonna talk to BCW?

328
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,580
Yeah, we already
worked it out.

329
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,015
Well, you wanna
tell me the plan then?

330
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,082
When you get back.

331
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,384
This is my life.

332
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,337
Yeah, ya know what,

333
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,853
and everybody else's too.

334
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,656
Go get the f'in Coke.

335
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,152
Hey! Hey!

336
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,521
What the hell are you doing?

337
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,128
Scout!

338
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,599
Wait!

339
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,434
Scout!

340
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,105
Scout!

341
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,710
Oh shit. Shit!

342
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,049
Shit.

343
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,756
Now, the foster family
that's taking you is very nice.

344
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,257
Yeah?

345
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,959
When was the last time
you said to some kid

346
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,496
the foster family that's
taking you totally sucks,

347
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,663
so just pull yourself together

348
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,764
'cause the next four
years of your life

349
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,500
are gonna be pure hell?

350
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,475
What about my great
grandmother, huh?

351
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,310
She going to foster care too?

352
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,579
She sure as hell can't
take care of herself.

353
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,116
Can I say goodbye?

354
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,800
* It's the first defeat

355
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,004
* That cuts you to your bone

356
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,507
* Knock you off your feet

357
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:58,611
* You just never felt home

358
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,714
* It's not a person or place

359
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,251
* But a feeling you can't

360
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,054
Gram, I'm going.

361
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,624
Someone from Visiting
Nurses is gonna come by

362
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,059
and check on you.

363
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,796
Try not to burn the house down.

364
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,638
I love you.

365
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:43,189
* This will be the last time

366
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:50,062
* This will be the last time

367
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:56,736
* This will be the last time

368
00:23:57,003 --> 00:24:00,139
* You take me

369
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,221
Hey.

370
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,591
You ready to break outta
this joint for real?

371
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,859
Go on a road trip?

372
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,661
How did you get up here?

373
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,230
I brought you some clothes

374
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,298
in case you're getting tired
of the whole bathrobe look.

375
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,300
They're kinda lame but wait.

376
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,670
Tada!

377
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,139
It's a raincoat.

378
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,042
Listen, we can get you new ones.

379
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,481
Okay, you don't have to
come if you don't want to.

380
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,183
Send you a postcard.

381
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,919
Besides, you'd be missing out

382
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,988
on some really
great events here.

383
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,151
Come on Ray, pick up.

384
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,658
Got a drivers license?

385
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,111
I bet you're one
of those cat people.

386
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,647
You know, those cat lovers

387
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,182
who go to all the
shows and stuff.

388
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,985
He hates cats.

389
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,023
Yeah, my mother died
and left me this sweater.

390
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,727
Aww, I'm so sorry.

391
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,462
Yeah well, she
could've left me a house.

392
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,264
Or a car.

393
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,438
Thank you.

394
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,574
Alright, all I need
is a drivers license

395
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,343
and credit card please.

396
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,880
I don't have a
credit card but...

397
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,248
No credit card?

398
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,750
No, I got a license.

399
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,184
You're staying at
the most expensive

400
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,386
mental institute and you
don't have a credit card?

401
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,860
Can we pay cash?

402
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,061
That's a good one.

403
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,196
Everybody knows you
can't rent a car

404
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,831
without a credit card.

405
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,369
Do you have a
ladies room I can use

406
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,805
or do I need a credit
card for that too?

407
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,341
Yes, we do. It's
right over there.

408
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,541
Thanks.

409
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,384
* Some people call me crazy

410
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,019
* Spin round and round

411
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,922
* I just say whoopsie daisy

412
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,191
* Then come unwound

413
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,225
'Scuse me.

414
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,595
Hello, how can I help you?

415
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,831
Which kind of car
would you like?

416
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,835
Sure, sure, no problem.

417
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,840
Just a moment, let
me look into that.

418
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:27,313
Mmhmm, I'll get that
for you right away.

419
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,917
Well, I'm not sure.

420
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:33,720
Sure.

421
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,723
Are you crazy?

422
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:37,742
That's your
department, remember?

423
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,291
Get in before she sees us!

424
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,793
Get in the car!

425
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,329
Alright then.

426
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,531
Thank you. We'll see
you at 12:00 noon.

427
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,317
Come on!

428
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,834
Just drive. Drive!

429
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,103
Oh! Oh no, no, no!

430
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:53,873
No!

431
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,708
'Scuse me.

432
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,610
I have a rental car
that's being stolen.

433
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,016
The corner of

434
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,654
I don't know what
I was thinking.

435
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,656
We needed a car.

436
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,642
Yeah great, now you can add

437
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,692
grand theft auto to your resume.

438
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,928
We're just like
Bonnie and Clyde.

439
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:18,397
No, we're just
like dumb and dumber.

440
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,968
Do you want me to drop
you off at the pawn store?

441
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,771
No. What'd
happened to you then?

442
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,473
I don't know. I'd
hitchhike, I guess.

443
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,707
Yeah great, then you'd end up

444
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,077
duct taped to death
in the back of a van.

445
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,578
You wanna drive?

446
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,080
No.

447
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,547
It might look better if
the person with the license

448
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,549
is the one actually
doing the driving.

449
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,085
I'm not much of a driver.

450
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,053
Wanna try?

451
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,553
No.

452
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,795
Is your Mom really dead?

453
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,299
No.

454
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,873
She's not.

455
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,516
Hey, clothes store.

456
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,334
You keep a lookout, okay?

457
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,388
Come on, let's go, let's go!

458
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,127
Hey!

459
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,142
No.

460
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,945
Lighten up soldier.

461
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,986
Think it looks pretty good.

462
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:27,759
I mean, what if
somebody sees us?

463
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,028
Who?

464
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:56,322
Why did you, ya know?

465
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,259
There must have been a reason.

466
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,595
A girl? Money problems?

467
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,469
Sorry, I don't mean to pry.

468
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,104
Just never met anyone

469
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:14,440
that killed themself
on purpose before.

470
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:20,646
I lost all hope.

471
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,681
All hope of what?

472
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,486
All hope of anything.

473
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,156
That's not possible.

474
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,025
What's not possible?

475
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,995
To lose all hope.

476
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,265
I mean, you might have
hoped to be dead but,

477
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:40,699
it's still a hope.

478
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,334
Pretty shitty hope.

479
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,702
Just sayin'.

480
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,705
No, it's actually
kind of like the worst.

481
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:48,274
Hope.

482
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:51,110
Must have been a
bummer when you weren't.

483
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,212
Yeah, I guess.

484
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,348
Was it bloody?

485
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,008
Shit, duck.

486
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,789
Where are we going?

487
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,596
To get my sister back.

488
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:20,766
Will you help?

489
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:24,869
Yeah.

490
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,011
Goodnight.

491
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,593
All my children have left me

492
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,495
one time or another.

493
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,664
No reason why Scout
should be any different.

494
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,900
You don't think
she's a little young

495
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:55,934
to be?

496
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,170
Scout?

497
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,006
Scout's as old as the hills.

498
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:05,311
And this boy.

499
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,780
You ever see him with
your great granddaughter?

500
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,583
Well, he don't look familiar.

501
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,086
Yeah, New York boy.

502
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,524
So, you have no idea where...

503
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,460
Now, didn't you already
ask me that question?

504
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,364
I had a talk with
the waitress at Lynn's.

505
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,201
Said she saw em together.

506
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,174
Never trust a man who
won't drink with ya.

507
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:36,642
Wish I could.

508
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,179
What's retirement?

509
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,117
Crystal
had her first baby at 12

510
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:47,386
after being raped by her father.

511
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,920
She ran away from home.

512
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,557
Well, if you

513
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,794
hear from anyone.

514
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,195
Oh well,

515
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,497
Scout won't call here.

516
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,532
She's too smart for that.

517
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:01,933
Yeah well.

518
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,637
I don't suppose
you're a smoker huh?

519
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,641
Lungs are a terrible
thing to waste.

520
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,778
Past tense. Already did.

521
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,547
Might as well enjoy it now.

522
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,817
Yeah, might as well.

523
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,486
Good evening, ma'am.

524
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,493
F'in bureaucrat.

525
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,863
Stuff started happening.

526
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,365
The hitting, the kicking,

527
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:36,001
it's just always been
a part of my life.

528
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,769
The sexual abuse?

529
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,338
That
started when I was eight.

530
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,973
So, here you
are with two unwanted children

531
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,376
by this man, your father.

532
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,378
Where did you get the courage?

533
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,220
My Mom and Dad
needed some privacy.

534
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,807
Psst. Hey.

535
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,803
When I was pregnant
with my second baby,

536
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:48,774
my father attacked me
with a kitchen knife.

537
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,755
I blacked out.

538
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,127
I was in the hospital
with over 100 stitches.

539
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,896
It was the people
in the hospital

540
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,799
that convinced me
to go get help,

541
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,301
go to a shelter.

542
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,935
Weren't you scared?

543
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,437
Yes.

544
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:21,139
Every day, I walk out my door.

545
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,674
How do you watch that shit?

546
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,943
It's educational.

547
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,984
The beloved classic,
To Kill A Mockingbird,

548
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:35,787
went on to garner
three Academy awards,

549
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,956
including the only
best actor Oscar

550
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,190
for Gregory Peck

551
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,626
- as Atticus Finch.
- Hey look, it's you.

552
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,328
His young
co-star, Mary Badham,

553
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,529
who gives a beautifully...

554
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:44,796
What?

555
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,964
...nuance
performance as Scout.

556
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,265
Isn't that what
you're named after?

557
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,836
No. Scout Willis.

558
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,238
Demi Moore's kid?

559
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,307
Demi Moore, the actress?

560
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,043
No, Demi Moore, the Senator.

561
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,111
Me and Tallulah both.

562
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,481
My Mom worshipped her.

563
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,050
People used to say they
could have been twins.

564
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,454
I guess she thought
if Demi Moore

565
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,855
could make it outta
the trailer park,

566
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,122
so could she.

567
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:14,493
Did she?

568
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,226
No.

569
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,797
Not the way she intended to.

570
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,333
It's hard to make it
outta the trailer park

571
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,834
when you're a junkie.

572
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,442
Do you think I look like her?

573
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,444
Demi Moore?

574
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,034
Well, the asshole
disconnected his phone,

575
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,436
but the lady at the
Ryder office says

576
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,805
the carnival's gonna
be in Clayton next.

577
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,674
You hungry?

578
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,911
Yeah, I got a little
money in the car.

579
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,913
You've got money?

580
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,881
A little.

581
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,283
Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,320
You thought I was gonna
steal it from you.

583
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,789
I was just saving
it for an emergency.

584
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,042
Well, please let me know

585
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,692
when we reach emergency status.

586
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,827
Can
I have the keys?

587
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,829
We don't need
your precious money.

588
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,567
Though
an untimely end

589
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,469
to Amy the Armadillo,
she will no longer

590
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:32,203
be the mascot of the school.

591
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,172
But, we hope that...

592
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,008
Go ask the clerk
for some condoms.

593
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:39,911
Just keep them distracted.

594
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:41,312
Look, I can get money.

595
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,881
That's no fun.

596
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,148
Go!

597
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:52,290
Hey, could I get some condoms?

598
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,092
Well,
here's one from the only

599
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,127
in-Texas files.

600
00:39:56,462 --> 00:40:00,131
Teenage girl walks into a
west Texas car rental company,

601
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,501
but when the clerk
refuses to rent her a car,

602
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:05,604
she slips out the
back and steals one.

603
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,273
Oh, the police say
the girl in question

604
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:10,442
has dyed her hair pink,
so that should make her

605
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,377
a little bit easier to spot.

606
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,280
If you know anything,
they're looking for a 2008

607
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:18,016
dark blue sedan that
was pretty serious...

608
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,184
Just hang on.

609
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,586
Hey, don't you
want any of these?

610
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,555
You made me pull them
all down for nothin'.

611
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:26,891
Hey!

612
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:29,961
Asshole.

613
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,030
Who you callin' asshole man?

614
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,599
Just go, don't worry about it.

615
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,534
Hey, you're that girl.

616
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,268
The one that stole
the car, that's you.

617
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:39,671
Put the phone down.

618
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,406
Hey, find something
to tie him up with.

619
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,574
Yeah.

620
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,044
Sit down. Sit
down, face the wall.

621
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,747
Sit down, give me the phone.

622
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:51,516
Give me your hands.

623
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,073
That the front key?

624
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,088
Yeah.

625
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,059
Go get the car.

626
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,787
You were pretty
cool back there.

627
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
You know that?

628
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,488
Hey, can we just
pull over a second?

629
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,374
Right here?

630
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,389
Yeah.

631
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,630
Woah, hey!

632
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:14,331
Hey!

633
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:29,915
Hey, come here!

634
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:33,919
Come here!

635
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,587
Sam, come here!

636
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:38,256
It's this thing, I saw
it on Faith Price once.

637
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,491
Just lie down and put
your head on my chest.

638
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:41,860
Just try it.

639
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,065
Listen to my heart beat, okay?

640
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,268
You'll probably go to
hell for that, ya know?

641
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,437
Coloring over the Virgin Mary.

642
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,875
Bet that's where your Mom is.

643
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:37,649
You listening to me?

644
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,986
My Mom is dead.

645
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:45,423
My point exactly.

646
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,194
Yeah, nothin' serious,
but if you see her,

647
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,629
just give me a shout out here.

648
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:56,067
And here's a little
somethin' for you.

649
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,268
Thank you.

650
00:43:58,436 --> 00:43:59,604
Hey baby!

651
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,907
You comin' back in here soon?

652
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,574
Yeah, I'll be right there.

653
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,362
Alright.

654
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,645
Thank you.

655
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,141
Okay, like the lady
on the phone said,

656
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,877
they're gonna be in
Clayton on September 2nd.

657
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:41,179
We should be able to
get there by then.

658
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,382
Alright.

659
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:56,794
What are you doing?

660
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,196
What's funny?

661
00:44:58,496 --> 00:44:59,597
Nothing.

662
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:01,617
Didn't your mother teach you

663
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,101
it's rude to Google?

664
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,303
It wasn't right
to Google people?

665
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,110
Wanna give me that thing?

666
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,431
You know, there's this guy,

667
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,468
Vlad the Impaler and they
base Dracula off him.

668
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,004
Anyways, he used to
have these picnics

669
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:41,072
when he was surrounded
by like hundreds,

670
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,174
I mean hundreds of his victims

671
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,810
and they'd just have
like these spikes

672
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,144
stuck up through their
bodies and they'd

673
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:48,179
bleed to death as
he ate his lunch.

674
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,515
Or breakfast or ya know.

675
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:53,751
You and Lulu are
gonna make a great pair.

676
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,355
Are you sure she's better off,

677
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:00,225
ya know, living with me?

678
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,429
You know, I mean, you
don't know how crazy I am.

679
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,432
Yeah, trust me.

680
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:10,135
You're a lot less
crazy than my Dad.

681
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,670
He's nuts. Totally nuts.

682
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,072
And nasty.

683
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,875
He's kinda like that
guy from the oil movie.

684
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:18,443
What oil movie?

685
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:22,713
Ya know, he'll
drink her milkshake.

686
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,115
Oh, you've seen that?

687
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:25,550
Yeah.

688
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,718
If you keep doin'
that, you're gonna throw up.

689
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,690
What about your Dad?

690
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,025
Is he crazy too?

691
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,794
Yeah, he was.

692
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,030
What do you mean?

693
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,101
He died.

694
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,303
How?

695
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,540
He was in this
mental institution and

696
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,277
he stole the director's car

697
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,012
and drove it off a cliff.

698
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,952
I think someone's
following us.

699
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:35,954
It's been following
us basically since

700
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,655
we left the taco truck.

701
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:39,656
Pull over.

702
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,102
Is that it?

703
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,071
Yep.

704
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,040
Guess they're not
following us any more.

705
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,988
We
should find a hotel.

706
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:14,059
A hotel?
Did we strike oil?

707
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:16,227
I don't
think it's a good idea

708
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,096
to live out of the car any more.

709
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,111
Wow.

710
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,858
Sorry, didn't hear you guys.

711
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,895
Hey, look it's your book.

712
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,563
It's like his bible.

713
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,132
Yeah, it's pretty good.

714
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:55,666
Guess that's why I
didn't hear you guys.

715
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,767
Have you gotten up to the part

716
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:57,935
with TJ Eckleburg?

717
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,238
Eckleburg, the eyes
of Dr. Eckleburg.

718
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,407
Are blue and
gigantic, their retinas.

719
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,742
Okay Shakespeare,
you can stop.

720
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:06,978
He just got out of solitary.

721
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,750
Uh, so you read the
Great Gatsby in jail?

722
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,919
Yeah, death row.

723
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,288
So, we gonna start a book club

724
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:18,723
or can we get a room?

725
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:20,458
Sure, sorry.

726
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,461
Is that gonna be
one room or two?

727
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,065
He just spent
three years in jail.

728
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,333
What do you think?

729
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,336
My sister and I can share.

730
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,509
Alright, just need a
signature and a credit card

731
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:39,977
and you'll be good to go.

732
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:42,247
Oh, I don't actually have
a credit card at the moment.

733
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,851
But, I could pay for
the whole thing upfront,

734
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,519
if that's okay.

735
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,694
Room 414.

736
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:04,535
Were you really in jail?

737
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,415
My sister and I can share?

738
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,284
What did you want me to say?

739
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,886
You liked her.

740
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,523
Admit it. You
thought she was cute.

741
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:26,691
She is cute.

742
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,094
If you like bimbo's.

743
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,064
She's reading
The Great Gatsby.

744
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:34,732
I doubt she's a bimbo.

745
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:37,702
You should ask her out.

746
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,505
Why? You just
called her a bimbo.

747
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,641
You're a guy. You're
supposed to like bimbo's.

748
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:49,846
Wow.

749
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,417
You think you could live here?

750
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,119
After we get Lulu?

751
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:55,819
Yeah.

752
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:59,490
Yeah, you could be like

753
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,526
Eloise from Lubbock.

754
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,494
Who's Eloise?

755
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:05,163
Another one of your bimbo's?

756
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:06,864
No, she's um,

757
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:09,700
she's this girl that
lives at the Plaza hotel.

758
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:11,436
She's fictional.

759
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:14,004
A lot of your
friends are fictional.

760
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:17,708
Yeah, I mean, they're
better than real people.

761
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,610
Thanks.

762
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,513
No, not you, I mean.

763
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:25,383
You're different.

764
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,590
Hello?

765
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,194
He's not here right now.

766
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,828
It's the bimbo.

767
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:45,570
If we stay, she has got to go.

768
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,233
See? Told ya.

769
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,502
Small town, nothin' to do.

770
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:29,680
So, this is how we
amuse ourselves.

771
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:35,986
Wow, I don't...

772
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:40,157
wow, how does that even work?

773
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,860
There's something in
the soil from the plant

774
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,762
that just makes it light up.

775
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,664
Drink!

776
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:48,332
Got it?

777
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,585
Can't believe that
you're really into

778
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:42,119
The Great Gatsby.

779
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,323
You're really obsessed
with that book, aren't you?

780
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,760
I didn't mean that in a bad way.

781
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,095
It's nice.

782
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,402
In school, we had to go around

783
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:00,237
and say which character we
identified with the most.

784
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:04,775
I bet you'd choose Nick.

785
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,111
No.

786
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:11,382
I was more like the son that

787
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,784
Gatsby and Daisy never had.

788
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,186
And I'd be what's left after she

789
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,823
was finished destroying him.

790
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,560
That's really sad.

791
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,460
Is it always this
empty around here?

792
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:59,296
Pretty much.

793
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,568
You're not exactly in the
center of the universe.

794
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,302
Especially this time of year.

795
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:09,474
It's a bit claustrophobic,
don't you think?

796
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,519
You okay?

797
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:31,396
It's about time. Bonehead.

798
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:39,036
Scout Havers?

799
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,578
Hey look, Melinda,

800
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:48,979
I'm really sorry.

801
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,548
You said that already.

802
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,650
Yeah, well.

803
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:54,651
Yeah.

804
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:20,578
Scout.

805
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:23,481
Scout.

806
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:35,425
Shit.

807
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,137
'Scuse me, have you seen this
girl that I've been with?

808
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,673
She's like this
tall. She's blonde.

809
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,575
No, I haven't seen anybody.

810
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:51,976
Well, has anybody
else checked in today?

811
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:54,244
I'm not supposed
to tell you that.

812
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,814
Hey! You can't do that.

813
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:00,585
Ren Preston, 506.

814
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:07,791
Scout.

815
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:11,529
Where is she?

816
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:12,563
Hi Sam.

817
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,264
Where is she?

818
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:23,941
She's fine.

819
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:25,375
Oh fine?

820
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:28,378
Yeah, it was either that
or put a muzzle on her.

821
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,648
Look what she did to my arm.

822
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,418
Your mother wants
to talk with you.

823
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:36,654
Well, my mother
can go to hell.

824
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:38,856
Hey Sam.

825
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,691
Do you know how many
laws you've broken?

826
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:42,693
Look, I don't
need a babysitter.

827
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,163
Just talk with her.

828
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:50,200
Okay but, can we
go somewhere else?

829
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:51,969
Just downstairs or something?

830
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,606
Okay.

831
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:07,451
It's so
desperately hot.

832
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,521
Why does the power
always have to go off

833
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:12,256
on the hottest day of the year.

834
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,392
Oh, I'm sorry. Where were we?

835
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:22,900
The word for when you
wanna kill your own child.

836
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:24,887
Abortion.

837
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,604
No, no, no, no, umm...

838
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:29,607
matricide.

839
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,675
Babycide.

840
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:34,544
Sam.

841
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:37,715
Oh, speaking of children.

842
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,622
Pigeon.

843
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,393
Do you know how absolutely
distraught I've been?

844
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,262
Maria.

845
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,569
Oh sweetheart.

846
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,438
You can't just keep
running around the country

847
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,107
breaking the law.

848
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:06,476
It's uncouth.

849
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,945
Is that all you
give a shit about,

850
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:09,113
how it looks?

851
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,065
'Cause you really
didn't seem to mind

852
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,649
when Dad was losing his mind.

853
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,350
Pigeon, you
don't really mean that.

854
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,785
Oh, no of course. I'm sorry.

855
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:16,420
Having a crazy son's
nowhere near as romantic

856
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,388
as having a crazy husband.

857
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,391
Pigeon?

858
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,060
Have you been drinking?

859
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:26,163
She wants to talk to you.

860
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,100
Yeah?

861
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,154
You've gotta help me here.

862
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,169
I just.

863
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,773
Just a minute. You okay?

864
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,441
I'm just feeling
a little nauseous.

865
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,777
You didn't stop
taking your medication?

866
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,680
Red, I'll be right
back. I'll be right back.

867
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:43,633
Alright.

868
00:59:43,648 --> 00:59:45,015
I guess he went to the restroom.

869
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,317
Yeah, he said he's
a little nauseous.

870
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:55,826
Hey hey, you okay?

871
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,095
Look, we only have
five minutes together.

872
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,797
So I need you to be calm, okay?

873
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,467
You know this asshole?

874
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,836
Yeah, he kinds works for us.

875
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,471
You've got to be kidding.

876
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:08,639
No, I'm not.

877
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,108
He used to be a Texas
ranger and then,

878
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,443
he was put in the psych
ward next to my Dad.

879
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:14,764
So that's who's
been following us,

880
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,280
someone that works for you?

881
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:19,917
Hey, did you see the
bite mark I gave him?

882
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,118
Yeah, nice one Mike Tyson.

883
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,219
Alright, come on.

884
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,292
Sam?

885
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:39,636
Son of a bitch.

886
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:42,572
Hey, can you help me pack?

887
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,175
Yeah. Sure.

888
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,277
What happened to
this room anyway?

889
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:49,613
Your friend attacked me.

890
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,981
Oh yeah?

891
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,852
With cookies and mini bottles?

892
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,088
You know how in the
beginning of Cinderella,

893
01:00:58,122 --> 01:01:01,225
all those little mice and
things come and help her?

894
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:03,627
You should see
those suckers drink.

895
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,579
You're crazy.

896
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,296
That's why you like me.

897
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:08,984
Okay Cinderella.

898
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,901
Cookie if you want it.

899
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,377
Damn it!

900
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:30,454
Shit.

901
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:35,559
Careful.

902
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,733
No, no, no, can't take the car.

903
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:43,719
No, we can't take the car.

904
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:44,734
Come on.

905
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:52,209
Sam!

906
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:11,628
Have you ever been in love?

907
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:15,399
Yeah. Once.

908
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,502
What happened?

909
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:21,738
She was a goldfish.

910
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,440
No, I don't know.

911
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,843
She didn't love me back.

912
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,311
Didn't work out.

913
01:02:29,013 --> 01:02:30,447
She was an idiot.

914
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,617
Yeah. I guess so.

915
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,425
We should get married.

916
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:43,460
No, we really shouldn't.

917
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,462
Besides, it's been like what?

918
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,332
24 hours since we've
broken any laws?

919
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,167
No. I'm serious.

920
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,969
No, I'm serious.
You're 15 and drunk.

921
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,204
I'm not drunk! I'm serious!

922
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,339
No, you're really...

923
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:56,841
Hey, I'm serious.

924
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:59,443
No. I'm serious, you're
15 and you're wasted.

925
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:00,911
I'm not wasted.

926
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:03,080
Yeah you are, I saw like
a thousand mini bottles

927
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,681
in the hotel room.

928
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:11,288
You have no
sense of adventure.

929
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:36,480
Ray loves to claim he's
not my real father.

930
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:38,849
Sure as hell hope he's right.

931
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:42,519
You know what their
favorite place to aim is?

932
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,055
The balls.

933
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,094
He has to wear all this
protective gear and stuff

934
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:51,195
so he doesn't get hurt.

935
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:52,596
Ladies
and gentlemen,

936
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:54,031
step right up!

937
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:58,002
Can we live in New
York after we get Lulu?

938
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,737
What, with my Mom?

939
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,572
No, definitely
not with your Mom.

940
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,842
She probably lives in some
big, fancy building right?

941
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:08,612
Yeah, 76th and 5th.

942
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:10,347
It overlooks the park.

943
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,283
The East Village.

944
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,718
I've always wanted
to live there.

945
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:15,953
Sure.

946
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,623
Sure, but you gotta
go to school though.

947
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:21,525
I hate school.

948
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:22,626
You hate school?

949
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:23,660
I hate school!

950
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,062
Jesus, school's great.

951
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:26,863
School's great. You
get an education.

952
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,065
Ya make friends.

953
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:29,666
Do drugs? Have sex?

954
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,268
We'll be just like
a normal family.

955
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:32,121
Yeah.

956
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:33,470
It'll be nice.

957
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:34,671
Yeah.

958
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:48,752
Okay, we need to
find Ray's trailer.

959
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:52,456
Wanna look down here?

960
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:53,958
Yeah.

961
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,459
I mean, should we be
looking for anything,

962
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,995
like shitty decorations maybe?

963
01:04:58,028 --> 01:04:59,163
I don't know.

964
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,864
I've never been to
his carnival before.

965
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,340
I bet you that one's his.

966
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,209
Real welcoming.

967
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,411
Come on.

968
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:29,759
Well, his junkie
girlfriend's in there,

969
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,295
but I don't see Lulu.

970
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:33,563
I'm gonna go around front.

971
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:34,731
You stay here and
keep watch, okay?

972
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,576
Your head is
backwards. I don't care!

973
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:48,712
Lulu!

974
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:49,798
Oww!

975
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:52,782
Lulu! Lulu, are you okay?

976
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:56,920
No. I'm dead.

977
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,459
Why didn't you put me
on a milk carton, Scout?

978
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:05,162
Maybe somebody
would have found me.

979
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:06,963
I did find you, Lulu.

980
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:08,732
Now I'm gonna take you home.

981
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,734
Come out and talk to me, okay?

982
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:11,868
I can't.

983
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,870
It's my punishment.

984
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,373
Come out here please and talk.

985
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:20,710
What happened to your hair?

986
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,482
Tallulah?

987
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,819
You talkin' to somebody?

988
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,390
King Bochi.

989
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:35,992
King Bochi?

990
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:37,961
He's my stuffed dog.

991
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,331
There ain't no
stuffed dog out here.

992
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:42,766
That's because Daddy made me

993
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,368
leave him with Gram.

994
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,570
But I can still talk to him.

995
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:50,507
K, well talk to him
a little more quietly.

996
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:52,576
You're givin' me a headache.

997
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,012
Shit Lulu.

998
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:57,747
You're all banged up.

999
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:01,051
Come on, let's get outta here.

1000
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:02,319
Hey Tallulah,

1001
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,121
you under the trailer again?

1002
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:05,655
I got a new one for ya.

1003
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,325
What do you call
the red gooey stuff

1004
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,128
that gets between the toes of
the elephant at the circus?

1005
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,363
The slow clown.

1006
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:19,002
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

1007
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,037
You disconnected your phone.

1008
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,110
Have you been hitting her?

1009
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,945
Nah. It's a rough and
tumble world, Scout.

1010
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,414
Tallulah, come on
out from under there.

1011
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:31,548
Come on.

1012
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:33,117
Say goodbye to your sister.

1013
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,351
But she just got here.

1014
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,419
Yep and now she's leaving.

1015
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:36,820
She said I was going with her.

1016
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:37,839
No, you're not going anywhere.

1017
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:38,988
You come around here again,

1018
01:07:39,022 --> 01:07:40,190
I'm gonna get the
cops after you.

1019
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,143
Yeah and if your
druggie girlfriend

1020
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:41,810
lays another

1021
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:42,711
finger on her...

1022
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:43,645
Leave Georgia outta this!

1023
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,546
She saw the Virgin Mary once

1024
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,230
on the side of a 14-wheeler.

1025
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:47,564
That's really tragic.

1026
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:48,550
It's not a joke.

1027
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,400
She saw God. Go on!

1028
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:53,870
Thing like that'll
mess you up for life.

1029
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,439
Living with you would
mess you up for life!

1030
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:56,540
Goodbye Scout!

1031
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:57,392
Why did you even take her?

1032
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,393
You don't want her!

1033
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,443
Goodbye.

1034
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,111
Hey!

1035
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:03,079
Walk away!

1036
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:05,849
Shit.

1037
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,122
Hey. Hey.

1038
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:15,259
Hey. It's okay.

1039
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,026
I got a plan, alright?

1040
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,430
It's fine.

1041
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,847
Red, it's Ray.

1042
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,284
Ray from the carnival.

1043
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,659
Get the red,
get the red. Yeah!

1044
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,805
Hello. Georgie Russert?

1045
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:04,608
Yeah?

1046
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:07,577
John Forest, Jesus
for Me and You magazine.

1047
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:08,812
I'm doing an article on people

1048
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:09,946
who have seen the Virgin Mary

1049
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,848
and I was hoping to include you.

1050
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:15,452
You're shittin' me, right?

1051
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,755
You're like a rock
star at the magazine.

1052
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,724
So, this is like that show

1053
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,360
where Ed McMahon
comes to your door?

1054
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:25,362
Except...

1055
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,998
without the giant check thing?

1056
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:32,536
I'm just thinking I
could take a few pictures.

1057
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:33,903
Maybe ask you a few questions.

1058
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:35,104
Would that be okay?

1059
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:37,926
Okay!

1060
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:38,941
Wonderful.

1061
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:43,046
Alright, I'll just
be over there.

1062
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:45,249
Okay, I'll come over there.

1063
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:01,783
You stay in here so you don't

1064
01:10:01,798 --> 01:10:03,367
mess everything up.

1065
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:06,703
Okay.

1066
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,843
And don't make so much
noise all the time.

1067
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,061
My goodness!
Look at you!

1068
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:34,816
Wow.

1069
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,933
You look A okay.

1070
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,204
You look miraculous.

1071
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:42,438
Thank you.

1072
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:43,572
Wow.

1073
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,709
I can't believe it.

1074
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,844
Okay, so first off,
I'm just thinking,

1075
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,647
maybe some prayer?

1076
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:52,516
Okay.

1077
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,018
Is that Mary?
Face Mary this way.

1078
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:56,686
I'm gonna just talk
to Jesus right now.

1079
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,720
Okay.

1080
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:00,223
Beautiful.

1081
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,959
Did I not tell you that
you're gonna be the cover?

1082
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,145
The cover!

1083
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,160
The cover.

1084
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:07,764
Oh my God.

1085
01:11:08,365 --> 01:11:09,633
Isn't this unbelievable.

1086
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,601
Oh my
gosh, this is crazy.

1087
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:13,970
You have no idea how
much of a rock star you are.

1088
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,405
I can't
wait to tell Ray.

1089
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,391
Who's Ray?

1090
01:11:16,406 --> 01:11:19,042
Ray is my fiance.

1091
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,645
Oh so, actually now
that I think about it,

1092
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:23,413
do you maybe wanna
change your outfit?

1093
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,014
Because you're gonna
be on the cover,

1094
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:27,183
anything that should
show your true colors?

1095
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,853
I'm gonna go put on my
Miracle at Smiley shirt.

1096
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:31,321
Okay? You'll stay right here?

1097
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:32,355
I will.

1098
01:11:32,856 --> 01:11:33,990
I'm gonna be famous!

1099
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,058
You are.

1100
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:47,456
Alright here, we
haven't got long.

1101
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:48,772
Give me this. Jump on my back.

1102
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,273
Alright, I got ya.

1103
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:53,777
Lulu?

1104
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,230
Lulu!

1105
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:57,313
This way, this way, come on.

1106
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:58,748
Sam.

1107
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,117
Lulu.

1108
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:03,520
Sam!

1109
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,091
Oh shit.

1110
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:09,759
Lulu?

1111
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:12,429
Ray.

1112
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:14,598
Sam!

1113
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:17,232
Sam!

1114
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:19,603
No, you guys go this way.

1115
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:20,636
Put her down.

1116
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,175
Scout!

1117
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:37,086
Move! Move!

1118
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,827
You can't go in
there without a ticket.

1119
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,730
I need a ticket!
I need a ticket!

1120
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,702
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.

1121
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,671
Come on. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1122
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,140
'Scuse me. I'm sorry, ma'am.

1123
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:01,845
Hey!

1124
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:03,713
Watch the front.

1125
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:05,348
There's no other way for
them to get outta here!

1126
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:06,716
We've got it covered.

1127
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,585
Sam? Scout?

1128
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:10,119
Come on, get in, get in.

1129
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:11,488
What now?

1130
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:12,889
Down that hole.

1131
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:15,158
Here, you guys
make a run for it,

1132
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:16,010
I'll keep him distracted.

1133
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:16,945
Give me the gun.

1134
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,127
We're not leaving you here.

1135
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:19,362
Give me the gun. I'll
keep him distracted.

1136
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,930
I'll meet you at the bus
stop at 8:00, alright?

1137
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,231
Give me the gun.

1138
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:25,702
Sam? Come on out.

1139
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,537
Lulu, put your legs down.

1140
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,090
You got her?

1141
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,306
Yep, here, come here.

1142
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:32,141
Alright, come on.

1143
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,376
I will
sit here until the

1144
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,044
cows come home, Scout!

1145
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,646
The bus stop, you'll
be there, you promise?

1146
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,114
I'll be there, I promise.

1147
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,416
If you're not there,
I'm gonna kill you.

1148
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,519
Love you too.

1149
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,552
Alright?

1150
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:46,122
Alright, come on Lulu.

1151
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,491
I'm going.

1152
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:50,244
Sam!

1153
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,427
Scout!

1154
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:55,932
Come on out.

1155
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,508
Sam, drop the gun.

1156
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,580
Drop the gun, Sam.

1157
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:15,218
Okay? Just drop the gun.

1158
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,120
Come on now.

1159
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,390
Come on. Drop the gun.

1160
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:29,132
Alright.

1161
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,685
You sure made a mess of
things this go round.

1162
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,855
I mean, I wouldn't wanna
disappoint my mother.

1163
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:53,723
God knows what she'd
do without a mess.

1164
01:14:53,757 --> 01:14:56,192
They're holding you
on a $10,000 bail,

1165
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,562
but they're gonna
drop the charges

1166
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,130
if you promise you'd go
back to New York with her.

1167
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:04,067
I'm not going
back to New York.

1168
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,268
That's not happening.

1169
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:07,537
If you don't,
they're gonna bring

1170
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:09,138
those two girls in.

1171
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:12,542
The younger one will go
back with her father.

1172
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,243
The other'll be sent to juvie.

1173
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:16,279
But they've got
nothing to do with this.

1174
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,281
It's not a perfect world.

1175
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:23,920
Whatever, if I go
back to New York,

1176
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:25,488
will you take care of them?

1177
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,125
I don't know if
your mother will...

1178
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:30,326
Ray.

1179
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:33,997
Okay yeah, I'll
make it happen.

1180
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:35,699
Thank you.

1181
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,134
I wish you and your Dad

1182
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,836
could have gotten to
know each other better.

1183
01:15:40,503 --> 01:15:41,738
I think you would've

1184
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:42,772
been able to help him

1185
01:15:42,806 --> 01:15:44,874
a lot more than I did.

1186
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,800
He's not coming.

1187
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:20,804
Scout?

1188
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:24,874
Are you okay?

1189
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,931
You're making
it easier. Thank you.

1190
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,034
Pigeon.

1191
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,403
Who always rescues you
when you need help?

1192
01:17:57,774 --> 01:18:00,543
Red is taking care
of your friend.

1193
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,478
This might be hard to believe,

1194
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,814
but I was actually
taking care of my friend.

1195
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,750
Don't be ridiculous, Pigeon.

1196
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:07,851
You can't take care of yourself,

1197
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,552
let alone anyone else.

1198
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:11,554
What were you planning to do?

1199
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:13,356
Spend the rest of
your life on the run?

1200
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:15,825
I wasn't on the run.

1201
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,394
You ready?

1202
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,939
Hey, you remember
what I asked?

1203
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:31,841
I got ya covered.

1204
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,610
You take care of
yourself, alright?

1205
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:39,648
Thank you.

1206
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,184
You're welcome.

1207
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:25,121
Shh.

1208
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:00,649
Can you stop that?

1209
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:03,486
There's nothing to do here.

1210
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:05,721
Why can't we go back to Gram's?

1211
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:08,024
Because we can't, okay?

1212
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,193
Can we play dressup?

1213
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:11,860
Whatever.

1214
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,124
Okay, we need to
find 76th and 5th.

1215
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,461
Come on.

1216
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:41,784
Which one should we try?

1217
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:46,089
How about that one.

1218
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:47,489
Okay.

1219
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:01,137
We're looking for Sam Prescott.

1220
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,140
Mr. Prescott doesn't
live here any more.

1221
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:05,908
But he did?

1222
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:09,145
Did he leave a
forwarding address or?

1223
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:11,980
Would you like me to
ring up Mrs. Prescott?

1224
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:14,417
Nevermind.

1225
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:11,274
Does that woman ever go out?

1226
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,258
Scout?

1227
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:30,892
What?

1228
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:33,596
Can we go now?

1229
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:35,331
I'm hungry.

1230
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:37,666
You're always hungry.

1231
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,802
It's dinner time.

1232
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,838
Soon, okay?

1233
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,180
Oh my God! That was his Mom!

1234
01:25:51,214 --> 01:25:52,348
Come on, come on!

1235
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,226
Hey, wait.

1236
01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:14,337
Okay, let's go.

1237
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:23,946
Lulu.

1238
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,482
Lulu, get away from the window.

1239
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:27,883
Scout, look.

1240
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,919
It's him! The looney bin guy.

1241
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:33,188
He's sitting right
there at the table.

1242
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:37,960
There are some things I
need to talk to you about.

1243
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:41,464
He's smiling.

1244
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:43,666
Pigeon?

1245
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,411
Oh my God, it's that girl.

1246
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:58,781
Why didn't you tell
me she's in New York?

1247
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:00,048
I didn't know.

1248
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:02,718
Sam, where are you going?

1249
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:04,119
Sam?

1250
01:27:21,404 --> 01:27:22,771
- Hey.
- Hi!

1251
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:25,674
Tallulah, welcome.

1252
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:28,444
You want me to take that?

1253
01:27:28,811 --> 01:27:31,580
* I went out in the rain
suddenly everything changed *

1254
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:36,619
* They're spreading
blankets on the beach *

1255
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:42,024
* Yours is the first
face that I saw *

1256
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:47,296
* I think I was blind
before I met you *

1257
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:49,932
* Now I don't know where I am

1258
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:51,767
* I don't know where I've been

1259
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,505
* But I know
where I want to go *

1260
01:27:57,873 --> 01:28:00,676
* And so I thought
I'd let you know *

1261
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,347
* That these things
take forever *

1262
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,115
* I especially am slow

1263
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:10,953
* But I realize
that I need you *

1264
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:14,657
* And I wondered if
I could come home *

1265
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:27,403
* Remember the time
you drove all night *

1266
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,975
* Just to meet me
in the morning *

1267
01:28:34,443 --> 01:28:37,380
* And I thought it was strange
you said everything changed *

1268
01:28:37,413 --> 01:28:42,117
* You felt as if
you'd just woke up *

1269
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:47,456
* And you said this is
the first day of my life *

1270
01:28:49,525 --> 01:28:53,028
* I'm glad I didn't
die before I met you *

1271
01:28:54,797 --> 01:28:58,767
* But now I don't care I
could go anywhere with you *

1272
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,571
* And I'd probably be happy

1273
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:06,975
* So if you want to be with me

1274
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:10,345
* With these things
there's no telling *

1275
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:13,148
* We just have to wait and see

1276
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:17,085
* But I'd rather be
working for a paycheck *

1277
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:20,556
* Than waiting to
win the lottery *

1278
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:27,095
* Besides maybe this
time is different *

1279
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:31,066
* I mean I really
think you like me *
