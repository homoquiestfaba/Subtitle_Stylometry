1
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:13,097
Hey.

2
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,506
Hey, how ya doing?

3
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,935
- Hey.
- Hi, Jimmy.

4
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:21,616
Hey, how you doing, Carly?

5
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:22,617
Julie.

6
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,838
Jimmy.

7
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,756
- How are ya?
- All right.

8
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:30,494
Well, what's the verdict?

9
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:32,578
Just a few more months.

10
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,965
What you gonna do with
the time you have left?

11
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:38,799
What would you do?

12
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,504
Oh, I'll get that, I'll get that.

13
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:42,611
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:43,612
Well.

15
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:49,985
No, ma'am and you and
me, we're not the same.

16
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:54,732
We'd probably choose different things.

17
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,966
Not true.

18
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,713
We're human.

19
00:01:57,714 --> 00:01:59,723
We'd choose the same things.

20
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,557
Life, love, happiness.

21
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:04,906
You forgot money.

22
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:10,702
It starts with money, then
we realize life is short

23
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:14,905
and we have to catch
up on the other three.

24
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,903
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, where's the fire?

25
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,885
Jimmy, my old lady, I
just don't understand her.

26
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,336
Women, right?

27
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,034
Women.

28
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,632
Hi, I know you're kidding,
or I dropped this tray

29
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,204
on both your asses.

30
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:31,644
If we'd be angry,
we'd be an emotional car.

31
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:35,208
- That's true.
- No, that's the worst thing.

32
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,465
- What's up, guys.
- Oh, hey.

33
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:39,133
The gang's all here.

34
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:44,878
Hey.

35
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,095
I'm Carly, welcome to EA.

36
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:48,929
Thanks.

37
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,579
Come on in, we're about to get started.

38
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,607
Hi, everyone.

39
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,846
I'm Julie.

40
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:04,398
Hi, Julie.

41
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:08,232
No questions, no advise,
stick it to yourself.

42
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:15,642
Many of you know I
struggle with this step.

43
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:17,621
I come back to it.

44
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:18,622
I skip it.

45
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,724
I come back to it again.

46
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:26,825
For today I shall think
of my higher power.

47
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,988
Myself and my neighbor.

48
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:35,975
I'm going to try and
relax and be truthful.

49
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,391
Hi.

50
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:44,951
My name is Faith.

51
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,619
Hi, Faith.

52
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:52,682
You said to give ourselves
over to the care of God.

53
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:55,435
I know my name is Faith but I'm not sure

54
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,103
if I believe in God.

55
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:03,099
It's not about God, it's
about a higher power within us.

56
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:05,915
Our spirituality.

57
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,364
Many of us don't believe in God.

58
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,115
We don't judge each other for it.

59
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,163
It's the higher power
within us moving us forward

60
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:19,015
towards a greater wellbeing.

61
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:21,043
Yeah, that's exactly what I...

62
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:23,444
Oh, sorry.

63
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,294
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

64
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:26,419
Hi, Jimmy.

65
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,420
Hi.

66
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,071
She's right, you know.

67
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:37,685
I've seen war.

68
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,388
Pain.

69
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:42,827
Death.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,847
I've known there's something out there

71
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,946
that's keep me tied to humanity.

72
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:59,401
Makes everything worthwhile.

73
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:04,677
After coming here I've learned
I can't control everything

74
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,478
that happens in my life.

75
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,979
Only my reactions.

76
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:13,048
How do you resolve your problem, Julie?

77
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,966
I didn't, not really.

78
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:22,119
But I did do something
to help me come to terms.

79
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,876
I had dealt with my pain
in secret for so long.

80
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,816
That I actually, I finally
told my best friend.

81
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,586
I know if I tell you in person

82
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:45,769
I can tell if you're being honest or not.

83
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,187
So, what is it?

84
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:49,375
What did I do?

85
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:52,506
About a year and a
half ago, I was diagnosed

86
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:54,840
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

87
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,756
- I went through the basics.
- Talk to me.

88
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:01,049
Chemo and whatnot.

89
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,088
A window.

90
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,407
It slowed the cancer
down, but not by much.

91
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,515
The window before the friend zone.

92
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,016
I was so angry and frustrated.

93
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:13,748
Answer the fucking question.

94
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,865
All the time.

95
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,009
I'm not gonna answer this question.

96
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,289
And I did not
know what to do about it.

97
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,180
No matter what I say, I'm
still going to be wrong.

98
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,014
I mean, I was angry.

99
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,858
But not at a doctor or at my cancer

100
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:30,201
but at myself.

101
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,596
My whole, my own body betrayed me.

102
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,526
I'm not gonna make it.

103
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,255
I'm not gonna have my happily ever after.

104
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,923
Instead of being mad
that my life is ending,

105
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,331
I'm coming to terms.

106
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,946
Yes, we had a window,

107
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,074
but Jules, you're my rock.

108
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:55,346
I've been sick for over
a year and a half now

109
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:57,186
with no change.

110
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:59,073
It's too late.

111
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:02,907
I finally told Andrew I
was, and now he knows.

112
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,627
It's done.

113
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,814
Nothing's changing.

114
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,314
What do you mean, you
aren't getting treatment?

115
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:13,153
I'm finally content and...

116
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:14,126
You have to.

117
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,043
Okay with everything.

118
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:21,012
I'm not gonna be afraid of dying anymore.

119
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:26,671
So you feel good about this, huh?

120
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:32,594
You drop this huge ass
bomb on your best friend

121
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:35,428
and now you're content with dying.

122
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:43,482
And it doesn't matter I
suppose how he feels about it

123
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:46,963
or anybody else fucking feels about it.

124
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,047
Jesus Christ.

125
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:51,582
One day, we're gonna find Andrew in here.

126
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,991
- That's not fair.
- That's not fair.

127
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:56,960
All right, guys, not now, okay.

128
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:00,378
We can talk about this after the meeting.

129
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:05,280
Sometimes you just have
to say things out loud.

130
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,282
That's step one.

131
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:11,366
Admitting that you're
powerless to your emotions.

132
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,100
That your life has become unmanageable.

133
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:19,552
I know my has.

134
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,902
So, Julie, how did that step help you?

135
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:32,260
It helped me not be
angry that I have cancer.

136
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:38,610
Because cancer had begun to define me.

137
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:47,082
People die happy, knowing
they lived a good life.

138
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:55,410
I think I was haunted by
not being able to have

139
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,207
that fairytale ending I
thought I had time for.

140
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,654
Hi, I'm Shawn.

141
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:08,322
Hi, Shawn.

142
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,190
Step nine is really hard for me.

143
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,680
Many of the ones I needed to do this for

144
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,692
aren't here anymore.

145
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,493
Suitable place for a suitable man.

146
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:26,640
All these things, these
steps aren't easy for me.

147
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,920
You wanna talk about it?

148
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:31,159
No, I don't wanna talk
about it, goddam it.

149
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,692
I just wanna drink in peace.

150
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:36,140
And admitting that isn't
an easy thing to say.

151
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,471
- You need help.
- Of course I need help.

152
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,030
And now the whole world
goddamn world knows

153
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,429
that I need help.

154
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,089
I still don't understand
why I couldn't speak

155
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,500
at my dad's funeral.

156
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,199
You didn't have to say anything.

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,923
I'm his son.

158
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:50,409
His grown-ass son and I couldn't think

159
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,429
of a couple of things to...

160
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,489
It still haunts me.

161
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,749
That was a once in a lifetime opportunity

162
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,098
that I'll never get the chance
to fucking say goodbye again.

163
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,158
And it wasn't because I didn't love him.

164
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,088
I don't look like a man.

165
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,089
And that image of myself will
be frozen in my brain forever.

166
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,750
I chose step eight and nine
to complete after step one.

167
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,585
Not because I was in a hurry.

168
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:20,748
I'm gonna be the same fucked-up
piece of failure he wants.

169
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:23,068
No, no, no, no, baby, you're not not.

170
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,467
But in case I ran out of time.

171
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,779
If we could take the memorial over,

172
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,953
what would you say?

173
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,891
I would feel good knowing that I did it.

174
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:32,892
Nothing.

175
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:40,235
I definitely wouldn't have
been able to do that before.

176
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,846
Hi, I'm Carly.

177
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,621
Hi, Carly.

178
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,132
This week I went on my first date

179
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,883
since my divorce with my husband.

180
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,852
It wasn't too bad.

181
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,543
Hi.

182
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:01,072
Hello, beautiful.

183
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:02,515
It's nice to officially meet you.

184
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:04,793
Yeah, I hope I didn't keep you waiting.

185
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:07,222
I'm disappointed in myself

186
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:08,842
that I continued on a date with a man

187
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:12,543
I had no intentions of seeing again.

188
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:15,602
So, Peter, what do you like to do for fun?

189
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:18,473
Talk to beautiful women like yourself.

190
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,034
That's nice.

191
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,431
What about you?

192
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:24,015
What do you like to do for fun?

193
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:27,053
I'm an artist.

194
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,395
I left Zane hoping that
I would find someone

195
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,052
who would treat me better.

196
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,862
And all I found was a guy on Tinder

197
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:36,231
who's obsessed with making
money and getting laid.

198
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:40,471
What do you wanna paint
me in the nude or something?

199
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,972
I just wanna meet Mr. Right.

200
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:53,705
So, sorry to end such a sour note.

201
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,622
And that's all the time we
have in this space today.

202
00:11:57,623 --> 00:12:01,706
We have water and coffee
and cookies in the back.

203
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:28,635
You know, that was selfish of you.

204
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:30,974
Hmm.

205
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:33,354
So, why?

206
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,995
We both...

207
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:48,426
We both were so afraid years ago.

208
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,820
So afraid to lose something
we thought we had.

209
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:07,504
He thought I mattered more
than what he was worth.

210
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,836
He thought his feelings
for me shouldn't matter.

211
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:24,539
I didn't wanna die without
telling him the truth about me.

212
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:29,679
If he ever got another
opportunity for love,

213
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,586
I wanted him to feel like he was worth it

214
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,246
to take that chance.

215
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,982
That his feelings mattered too.

216
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,169
I know you care about him,

217
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,788
but I think you're gonna
end up leaving yourself

218
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,190
with more regret than anything else.

219
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,455
I know we're supposed
to work on handling

220
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:02,789
our feelings here but I had
so many emotions to face

221
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,879
and they just needed to be free.

222
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,673
So why'd you leave
him hanging like that?

223
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:21,182
I mean, he's got to be beaten himself up

224
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,350
knowing you suffered this
long and never told him.

225
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:29,960
I was angry.

226
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,004
I guess I still am angry.

227
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:43,531
I'm dying.

228
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:47,394
And he can still live.

229
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:52,036
But he's not really with it.

230
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,962
You know this isn't over yet.

231
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:03,546
You ain't finished.

232
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,592
Come on.

233
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,122
Come help me put some of this stuff away.

234
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:14,324
I'll give you a ride home, okay?

235
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:32,272
You've been quiet all night.

236
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:39,816
I feel kind of weird telling you this.

237
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,642
But I am fucking pissed right now.

238
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:47,331
You're pregnant.

239
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,417
What's going on?

240
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:50,407
We're pregnant.

241
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,135
We're having a baby?

242
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,298
Harper's pregnant.

243
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,299
No, we...

244
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,086
We aren't.

245
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,766
Remember I told you I didn't want this,

246
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,558
not right now.

247
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,372
Hey, congrats.

248
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:07,158
Yeah, I thought so too.

249
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,797
But how can you dismiss my
feelings on this so casually?

250
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:13,145
That's not what Harper thinks.

251
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,727
I could've lied and never told you,

252
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,515
but you deserve more than that.

253
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:17,856
This is gonna kill us.

254
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:20,054
It doesn't have to.

255
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,745
You don't know what
you're talking about.

256
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,385
And you let her think
you weren't coming back.

257
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,385
It's your body, it's your choice.

258
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:26,886
But it's our baby.

259
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,081
I love you.

260
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:38,030
Please don't kill my baby.

261
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,973
What are you gonna do

262
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,390
if she don't change her mind?

263
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,660
I don't know, Jimmy.

264
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,696
I really don't know.

265
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,669
You going back home today?

266
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:58,669
I should.

267
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,002
I know I should.

268
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,016
I just don't trust myself.

269
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,950
All right, I'll give you one night.

270
00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:19,472
Figure out what you're gonna do and say.

271
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,756
On one condition.

272
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,059
Call her.

273
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,608
How do you do it?

274
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,048
How do you do what?

275
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,049
Connect.

276
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,419
Have you ever been
afraid to connect so much

277
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,337
that it hurt to be without someone?

278
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:42,229
I'm not sure.

279
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,398
I don't really wanna be afraid

280
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,671
to face what's holding me back.

281
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,810
That's what we're here for.

282
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,020
There's a card for the meetings.

283
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,318
My number's on it.

284
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,630
You can call me as long as I'm around.

285
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:56,798
Here, let me give you my number too.

286
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,806
Thanks, Jules.

287
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,639
- Oh, hello.
- Jimmy.

288
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,091
How was group today?

289
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,832
- Productive.
- Hmm.

290
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,033
I feel part of the group.

291
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,951
Have you been able to sleep more?

292
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:22,941
Thank you.

293
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,153
Couple hours on and off.

294
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:33,669
Night terrors, sweats?

295
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:37,712
Yeah.

296
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:44,265
Are you ready to start?

297
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,266
Okay.

298
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:48,782
Lie back.

299
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,659
Take a couple of deep breaths and relax.

300
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,959
And tell me all about it.

301
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,877
Start at the beginning.

302
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,990
I wake up in a bed.

303
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,844
But it's not mine.

304
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,370
I'm in a girl's room.

305
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:30,628
I don't recognize it.

306
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,918
Is anyone with you?

307
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,752
No, no, no, not now.

308
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:36,918
But...

309
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,298
There's just something's not right.

310
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,299
Something don't feel right.

311
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
I, I...

312
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,959
I can't pinpoint the cause.

313
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,871
So I reached for my sidearm.

314
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,113
God, they have shit at
night, I can't find it.

315
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,887
But I find my Ka-Bar.

316
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,389
We're taking fire but I'm not hit.

317
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:15,491
I...

318
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,473
I duck and I close my eyes.

319
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,431
It's okay, Jimmy.

320
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,841
You're in a safe place.

321
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:32,954
Open your eyes and tell me what you see.

322
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:38,024
I'm in hold ops.

323
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,739
I can still hear bullets firing.

324
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:49,834
They're firing things, not taking fire.

325
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:56,302
I wanna move, I've gotta move.

326
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,747
I got unrestricted men.

327
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,026
Just stand down.

328
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,754
I've gotta...

329
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:08,834
I need to do something.

330
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:09,918
I've gotta...

331
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:15,011
No one's listening to me.

332
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,211
No more.

333
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:44,764
You did good, Jimmy.

334
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,551
You've made progress today.

335
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:48,932
We finally left the bedroom.

336
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,850
So tell me, how are things at home?

337
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,044
Fine.

338
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,033
How are you
feeling about the baby?

339
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:02,211
Are you still overwhelmed?

340
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,962
No, no, not that...

341
00:22:06,876 --> 00:22:08,626
I don't know anymore.

342
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:11,133
You know.

343
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:15,717
It's hard to explain but over
there things were simple.

344
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,744
Like the Commander would say,

345
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:23,662
"Interrogate a target."

346
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:25,753
Done.

347
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:31,802
Or "Disable a vehicle."

348
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:32,803
I did it.

349
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,573
But this thing I'm going through...

350
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:45,376
A baby?

351
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:48,555
What?

352
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:53,294
That shit ain't simple.

353
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:55,326
You know...

354
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:01,816
There's all kinds of
complex shit to deal with.

355
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm a little unconventional.

356
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,122
I'm gonna tell you something
that helped my husband

357
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,052
when he came back.

358
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:12,886
Try going out dancing.

359
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:19,653
Dancing?

360
00:23:19,654 --> 00:23:21,493
Uh-huh, dancing.

361
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:25,004
It's reclaiming that trust
and harmony in a relationship.

362
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,852
A couple that sways
together stays together.

363
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,655
You know, you should check it out.

364
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,683
But don't make it a therapy thing.

365
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:33,692
Go with some others from group

366
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:36,360
and try to get your groove back.

367
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,524
And this is gonna help me how?

368
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,552
Give it a try.

369
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,274
It won't hurt you.

370
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:52,012
You know, sometimes it's the journey

371
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:56,013
and not the destination
that helps you the most.

372
00:23:58,845 --> 00:23:59,845
All right.

373
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,114
Hey.

374
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:07,215
Where you being?

375
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:09,213
I went to this EA meeting.

376
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,184
It's supposed to help with
my anxiety and whatnot.

377
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,718
Why do you even bother wasting your time

378
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,068
with that bullshit?

379
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,837
You're fine.

380
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:20,421
There's nothing wrong with you.

381
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:25,032
So what do you talk about in this meeting?

382
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:27,740
Nothing.

383
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:30,991
I didn't say anything, I just listened.

384
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
Cool, all right.

385
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:23,965
Hi.

386
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:26,191
Julie, this is Patty at Spencer Oncology.

387
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,333
I just wanted to let you
know that we're still waiting

388
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:31,080
for you to make an appointment
to go over your lab results.

389
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:34,014
Can you give us a call back?

390
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:39,591
Hey, Jules, call me back.

391
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:47,760
Jules, listen, you can't
just spring something like

392
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:50,417
that on someone and walk away.

393
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,698
That's not fair to you or me.

394
00:25:52,699 --> 00:25:53,782
Call me back.

395
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,630
Jules, please call me back.

396
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:06,950
You're my best friend.

397
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:10,058
Whatever you're going through,
I'm gonna be there for you.

398
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,397
You know this.

399
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:12,831
I love you.

400
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:17,101
Call me back.

401
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:25,837
It's really deep.

402
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,871
All right, just like when we
were at school, all right.

403
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:28,705
All right, let's do it.

404
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,038
One, two, three.

405
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:34,762
Got him.

406
00:26:35,454 --> 00:26:37,490
Okay, we're gonna have to redo that one.

407
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:39,246
Hey, can we get another one?

408
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,560
All right, one more round.

409
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,709
Oh, man, these got bigger.

410
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,388
Oh, ball and chain's back.

411
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:47,891
What are you doing?

412
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,634
Hey, don't worry about it, boss-lady,

413
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:52,529
we're just having a good time.

414
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,613
You can't drink away your problems.

415
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,868
Obviously, 'cause you're still here.

416
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,230
We're gonna need another round, please.

417
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:27,564
Make that two.

418
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,959
No, I'm not doing this right now.

419
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,747
I need a night to think
and I can't do that

420
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,298
with you in my ear.

421
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,132
I'll be home tomorrow.

422
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:44,300
I'm sorry about that.

423
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:45,491
Here, for you.

424
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:47,239
Thank you.

425
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,549
You think I couldn't
handle a few arguments.

426
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,322
I'm engaged to a veteran with PTSD.

427
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:58,170
You're arguing about
something pretty heavy.

428
00:27:58,171 --> 00:27:59,969
You wanna talk about it?

429
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,278
Especially if you need a
whole day to mull it over.

430
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,946
Harper's pregnant.

431
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,778
Well?

432
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,399
You're not ready?

433
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,999
No, that's not it.

434
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,399
I want the baby, but she doesn't.

435
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,943
And I have no say and I feel like

436
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:19,549
she's not considering my feelings.

437
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,928
Hmm.

438
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,512
That must be tough.

439
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,468
Well, you take all the time you need

440
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:28,141
to think about things, all right?

441
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:29,911
Jimmy and I are here for you.

442
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:30,912
Thanks.

443
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,350
Hi.

444
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:38,700
How's he doing?

445
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,451
He's getting there.

446
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,350
Goodnight.

447
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:44,909
Goodnight.

448
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,743
Goodnight, Avery, get some rest.

449
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,884
Chance, what are you doing here?

450
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,509
I've been drinking and I can't drive

451
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,843
and you're the closest walk.

452
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,561
I think you should go.

453
00:29:07,562 --> 00:29:09,881
- I'll call you a cab.
- Save your money.

454
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,350
I'll just sleep it off on the couch

455
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:15,268
and I'll just leave first
thing in the morning.

456
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,670
You're not welcome here, Chance.

457
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,181
Take the money leave.

458
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:23,221
Since when did you start living here?

459
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:25,160
He's helping me with bills.

460
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:27,848
Kind of hit a rough spot.

461
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,672
Look, my car is parked at the bar.

462
00:29:30,673 --> 00:29:32,779
I'll just sleep it off on the couch

463
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,452
and first thing in the
morning, I'll be gone.

464
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,281
Save your money.

465
00:29:37,282 --> 00:29:38,519
Good night.

466
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,187
You piece of shit.

467
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:45,312
Lock your door.

468
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,063
Scream if you need me.

469
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,614
You're safe, you're safe.

470
00:30:19,615 --> 00:30:20,773
I've got you.

471
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,363
I've got you.

472
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:40,474
How long?

473
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:47,101
Since he found out I was pregnant.

474
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:48,500
Why haven't you said anything?

475
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:49,501
I...

476
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,358
He doesn't even know it's happening.

477
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,526
Tonight it's the worst it's ever been.

478
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:06,521
I gave him something to
help him sleep tonight.

479
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:10,189
He usually wakes up
before it gets that bad.

480
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,209
Something...

481
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,947
Something is bottled up inside of him

482
00:31:16,948 --> 00:31:19,698
and he hasn't figured it out yet.

483
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:27,788
I don't know what to do,
but I don't wanna leave him.

484
00:31:30,082 --> 00:31:32,080
I hate to think of
what would've happened

485
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,700
if I hadn't been staying here tonight.

486
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:41,311
You have to tell him.

487
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,670
How?

488
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:50,081
He'll hate himself even
worse than he already does.

489
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:53,590
Please don't tell him.

490
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:57,878
He can't fix what he
doesn't know is happening.

491
00:31:57,879 --> 00:31:59,557
Think about your baby.

492
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:01,391
What if I wasn't here?

493
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:04,937
You go on to bed, it's okay,

494
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:08,089
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

495
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,757
I'll figured it out.

496
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:14,365
If you don't tell him, I will.

497
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,758
Hey, hey.

498
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,485
Wakey, wakey, sis.

499
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:33,695
How'd you get into my room?

500
00:32:33,696 --> 00:32:34,696
Please.

501
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:38,233
Why the hell would you
go into a locked room?

502
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:39,684
Why the fuck would
you wanna lock your door

503
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,575
from your own brother?

504
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,644
Is it because of Victor?

505
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:46,225
I just prefer enjoying
my personal space.

506
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:47,406
That's all.

507
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,963
Okay, I can give you your personal space

508
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:51,733
but I just wanted to thank my baby sister

509
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:55,521
with breakfast in bed for
letting me crash on the couch.

510
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:59,831
It's kinda hard to do that
when you lock your door.

511
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:02,665
There's more where that came from.

512
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:12,762
Good morning!

513
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,149
You want some?

514
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,499
No, no, no, no I don't want.

515
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,848
You sure you don't want some, man?

516
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:22,547
Yeah, no, I'm good.

517
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:23,686
You know what?

518
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:26,270
I bet all your shit's out on the streets.

519
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:27,104
All of it.

520
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:27,937
Gone.

521
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:30,479
I bet all my money on it.

522
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,942
Dude, you're broke, man,
what are you talking about?

523
00:33:33,943 --> 00:33:37,529
Dude, you totally let
Ellie have it last night.

524
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,530
What?

525
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,649
What did I say?

526
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,662
Let's see, only that you were
drinking your problems away

527
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:48,001
and that she was still there.

528
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:49,252
You get it?

529
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:51,914
You called your lady a problem, dude.

530
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:55,321
Phew, your ass is totally in the shitter.

531
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:56,322
Fuck.

532
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:59,553
What are you still drunk?

533
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:01,887
No, I think I'm hung over.

534
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,152
Don't sweat it, man.

535
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:07,486
Come on, you don't need her.

536
00:34:14,462 --> 00:34:16,832
Yeah, I know you like cherry pie

537
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,880
but what about cherry juice

538
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:20,770
'cause it's supposed to be
real good to help you sleep.

539
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:21,771
All right.

540
00:34:22,913 --> 00:34:23,913
I'll try.

541
00:34:25,424 --> 00:34:26,424
Hungry?

542
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:29,216
Looks great.

543
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,782
Seriously, Chance, you should've

544
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:41,393
just taken a cab and got out.

545
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:42,940
Why?

546
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:45,941
You don't wanna hang
with your big brother?

547
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,272
I barely see you anymore.

548
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:50,701
Not since Vic moved in.

549
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:53,879
I don't know, Chance, I
just feel weird around you.

550
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,209
I really need you to leave.

551
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,969
I started getting these
awful panic attacks

552
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,222
and I went to a therapist.

553
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:05,311
They think it has something
to do with a childhood trauma.

554
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,749
I think it may have
something to do with you.

555
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,150
What the fuck you talking about?

556
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:13,068
I'm saying, I think you raped me.

557
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:18,632
What the fuck are you talking about?

558
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,301
I never touched you.

559
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:24,719
This the first I'm hearing
about anything about rape.

560
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:30,140
Look, I never touched you, okay.

561
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,837
You're my baby sister.

562
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,187
We're family.

563
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,668
That's disgusting.

564
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,139
Family?

565
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,049
The kind of family where
you over drunk off your ass?

566
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,860
You broke into my room, Chance.

567
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:44,046
Who the fuck does that?

568
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:46,028
Are you fucking serious?

569
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:47,889
You're kidding me, right?

570
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,918
You're my baby sister.

571
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,606
I love you.

572
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,668
I wanna know who raped you.

573
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,868
'Cause I swear to God it wasn't me, sis.

574
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:55,619
And I'll fuck him up.

575
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:58,909
You should just leave, man.

576
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,741
What's your deal here, Victor?

577
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,575
Huh?

578
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,487
She said, she wants you to leave.

579
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:05,571
So get the fuck out, man.

580
00:36:05,572 --> 00:36:07,739
Please, Chance, just go.

581
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:10,659
This isn't over, sis.

582
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm gonna leave, but I swear to you,

583
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:14,570
I'm gonna find out who hurt you.

584
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:15,654
We're family.

585
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,410
I'm just so confused.

586
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,411
Faith?

587
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:24,668
Don't you fucking touch me.

588
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:29,591
Hey?

589
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,930
It's okay.

590
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I got you.

591
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,160
No one else is gonna hurt you.

592
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,997
I think we need to get
you a restraining order.

593
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:46,821
You gonna be okay?

594
00:36:58,641 --> 00:36:59,724
Hey, Jules.

595
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,521
Can you come over?

596
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:05,587
- Hey, man, you good?
- No, man.

597
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:08,467
I don't wanna deal with your
bullshit right now, okay?

598
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:10,436
I gotta find a way to
fix shit with my girl.

599
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,277
Yeah, that's not what
you said last night.

600
00:37:12,278 --> 00:37:13,498
I know, all right.

601
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,348
You keep reminding me.

602
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:17,818
Dude, she's my everything, man.

603
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,567
I'm lost without her.

604
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:20,600
It's no big deal, bro.

605
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:23,197
She's a fucking dick-blanket.

606
00:37:23,198 --> 00:37:25,948
Don't ever say that, all right?

607
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:30,567
Goddammit.

608
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,127
How did you sleep?

609
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,459
Not too bad.

610
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:44,182
No nightmares?

611
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:46,901
What's it to you?

612
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,610
It's a nice scarf, Becca.

613
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:57,450
But isn't it a little fancy for breakfast?

614
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:58,588
Thank you.

615
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:03,589
I was just putting together
a little something something.

616
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,229
I'm headed out soon.

617
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,651
Let me help you with that plate.

618
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:11,519
Don't you have something to tell Jimmy?

619
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,770
Tell me what?

620
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:21,550
Is there something going on with you too,

621
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:23,718
- I need to know about?
- No.

622
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:28,839
It's not what you think.

623
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,211
I know you think you're
getting better, man,

624
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,462
but you're not.

625
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:39,481
You had a nightmare last night.

626
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:42,572
I found you choking Rebekah.

627
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:46,823
Rebekah show him.

628
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,583
I did this?

629
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:10,358
Why would you hide this from me?

630
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,474
Baby, I'm sorry.

631
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:18,388
It was never this serious.

632
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,031
Sometimes it's just, it's just knee jerks

633
00:39:22,032 --> 00:39:24,371
or wailing your arms.

634
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:25,880
Screaming.

635
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:28,298
It's never been this serious.

636
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,734
I need to get some fresh air.

637
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:44,570
Let me grab my things,
I'll get out of your way.

638
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:49,733
Oh my god.

639
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,679
So as you can see, I
managed our finances.

640
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,331
We wouldn't be where we are
today if it weren't for me.

641
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,614
He had me on an allowance,
like I was a teenager.

642
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:04,953
You spend money like a teenager.

643
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:06,394
I earned money, like an adult.

644
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:09,670
No, I earn money like an adult,

645
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:11,994
long before she earned anything.

646
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,083
Plus it didn't cost me
money to make money.

647
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,141
What about you and your fancy art?

648
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:17,642
Did you ever earn any of your money back?

649
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:19,244
We were supposed to be a team

650
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:20,402
and you treated me like a child.

651
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:22,753
I had no privacy, nothing was mine.

652
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,181
You read my personal emails.

653
00:40:24,182 --> 00:40:25,015
You went through my phone.

654
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,822
I had no respect.

655
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:28,192
It's my computer.

656
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:29,690
No, it's our computer, Zane.

657
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:30,752
You see, that's your problem.

658
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:32,551
Everything is mine, mine, mine.

659
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,163
It's supposed to be our computer,

660
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,581
our house, our car, our kids.

661
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,694
You have the stipulation on
the things that you bought

662
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:42,013
but you don't seem to realize
I helped buy those things too.

663
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:45,747
Okay, I'd like for us to
focus on what we need to resolve

664
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:47,355
and if you're not able to do that

665
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:49,346
perhaps we should do a split mediation.

666
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:50,180
It's her.

667
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,885
She moves around from subject to subject.

668
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:54,225
How can I focus on
answering a single question?

669
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:56,913
If it wasn't about whose
things are who's, Carly,

670
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:58,215
why are we here?

671
00:40:58,216 --> 00:40:59,079
I can't believe you're trying

672
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,735
to justify your behavior right now.

673
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:01,569
Well, there's a difference

674
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,696
between helping buy and helping spend.

675
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:04,530
Yeah.

676
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,363
And there's a difference

677
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:07,965
between being a man and being an ass.

678
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,892
So if we're not going
to do a split mediation,

679
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:13,570
maybe it would be healthy for
the conversation right now

680
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,008
to take a short break.

681
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:17,067
I can't keep up with you
and these fucking tangents.

682
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:19,317
Let me just break it down for you.

683
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:22,401
You bought books, food, art supplies.

684
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:24,959
Did you get your hair done?

685
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,997
Did you get your nails done?

686
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:28,168
Okay, Zane.

687
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,002
You wanna break it down?

688
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:30,047
Let's break it down.

689
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,947
You wanna know what I was doing
while you were out working?

690
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,659
I was raising the kids.

691
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,650
I was cleaning the house.

692
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,048
I was taking in the practices.

693
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:38,140
I was watching their games,

694
00:41:38,141 --> 00:41:39,620
signing their permission slips.

695
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:40,898
Because by the time you got home,

696
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,567
they were already in bed.

697
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:45,210
Yeah, I was the one cooking
for them and cooking for you

698
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,158
and you wanna call it your house?

699
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,587
The computer that we shared is yours?

700
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:52,826
I'm not entitled to anything?

701
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:54,269
You know what, Zane?

702
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,659
I'll drop all of this.

703
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,160
If you can give me the name
of Raquel's favorite band.

704
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,860
Exactly.

705
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,186
Fuck you, Zane.

706
00:42:08,187 --> 00:42:09,020
Yeah, you know what?

707
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:11,637
I've made a lot of mistakes
and I can admit my wrong

708
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:12,729
but maybe you need some glasses

709
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,147
because you sure as shit can't see yours.

710
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,378
It sounds like you might
need that split mediation.

711
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:23,317
And I'd like to recommend
that you reconsider some

712
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:24,899
of the terms in the paperwork.

713
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,650
Or this might get a little messy.

714
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,071
He broke into my room.

715
00:42:32,072 --> 00:42:33,951
Okay, we need to call the police.

716
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,119
No we don't.

717
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:38,820
Well, if we're not calling the police

718
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,071
you need to start explaining.

719
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:42,302
All right.

720
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,753
It's my brother.

721
00:42:43,754 --> 00:42:45,680
Your brother?

722
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:47,598
Did something happened?

723
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:53,250
I think you need to
start from the beginning.

724
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,392
It started happening a year ago.

725
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:58,982
Around the same time my
Uncle Victor moved in.

726
00:42:58,983 --> 00:43:02,150
These awful nightmares, panic attacks.

727
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:06,953
This pain in my chest,
like I can't breathe.

728
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:09,080
My Uncle Victor found me a therapist.

729
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:12,728
Well, a hypnotherapist to help me.

730
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:17,729
Turns out I'm suppressing
something major from my childhood.

731
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,777
We were able to recover some memories

732
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:21,877
that I've blocked up but the details

733
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:23,961
are still a little fuzzy.

734
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,589
What kind of memories
are you blocking out?

735
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,840
I'm not sure.

736
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:34,256
I remember bits and pieces.

737
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:36,897
Like being really happy at a birthday,

738
00:43:36,898 --> 00:43:39,329
but then the memory goes dark.

739
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:44,247
Or riding in the car and then
feeling really uncomfortable.

740
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:47,527
I went to give my uncle
a hug the other day

741
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:50,681
and even his deodorant
made my stomach turn.

742
00:43:50,682 --> 00:43:53,085
Where does your brother
fit into all this?

743
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:54,406
According to my therapist, all

744
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:57,447
of these experiences point to my brother.

745
00:43:57,448 --> 00:44:01,339
The deodorant, the car
trips, the birthdays.

746
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,504
Does your brother wear the
same deodorant as your uncle?

747
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:05,505
Maybe.

748
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,977
I don't know.

749
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,412
Still trying to figure it all out.

750
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:11,913
Hey, who's this?

751
00:44:13,185 --> 00:44:14,210
I'm her Uncle Vic.

752
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,785
Oh.

753
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:16,619
Hey, Victor.

754
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,904
This is Julie.

755
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,972
Her an I met when I was out the other day.

756
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:21,252
That's nice.

757
00:44:21,253 --> 00:44:24,074
What are you beautiful
ladies talking about today?

758
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:24,908
Nothing.

759
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:26,213
Just personal stuff.

760
00:44:26,214 --> 00:44:29,963
Well, can I get you
anything to drink or eat?

761
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:31,342
- No.
- We're fine here.

762
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:32,176
Thanks.

763
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:33,810
I was actually on my way out.

764
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:34,811
- So.
- Okay.

765
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:41,544
Okay, Faith, I just sent
you Dr. Cuffee's number,

766
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,451
she's an amazing therapist.

767
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:47,291
Super sweet and her first
sessions are usually free.

768
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:48,734
So just give her a call.

769
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:51,314
See if she can fit you in.

770
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:54,635
I feel like I'm always
getting numbers from you.

771
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:56,969
We always help each other.

772
00:45:08,344 --> 00:45:10,094
Come on, let me in.

773
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,024
Dude, I think you should call her.

774
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:24,336
Rebekah?

775
00:45:24,337 --> 00:45:26,004
No, the therapist.

776
00:45:29,256 --> 00:45:30,977
You wanted to improve things with Rebekah

777
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,977
and you're not really mad at her,

778
00:45:32,978 --> 00:45:35,583
you're mad at yourself.

779
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:39,084
Maybe this will push you in your sessions.

780
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:41,365
Raquel is so cute.

781
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:45,303
She has made me this list
of like different outfits

782
00:45:45,304 --> 00:45:48,206
she wants me to wear.

783
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:49,744
Depending on the guys she's like...

784
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:51,391
That's so like her.

785
00:45:51,392 --> 00:45:52,461
I know, she's like, "Okay, mom,

786
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:56,099
"this is what you wear for this date."

787
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,982
I don't know where she gets it.

788
00:45:56,983 --> 00:45:59,744
- Fashion and stuff.
- I know.

789
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:03,828
I wonder where she gets it from?

790
00:46:13,174 --> 00:46:15,251
What do you want?

791
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:18,052
No, that's not part of the agreement.

792
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:20,886
I already agreed to the mediation.

793
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:23,593
Zane, we're not doing this right now.

794
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,062
I can't do this.

795
00:46:25,063 --> 00:46:26,371
Goodbye, Zane.

796
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:27,372
Goodbye.

797
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,865
Zane up to his normal dickhead ways?

798
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,116
Yeah.

799
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:37,670
You gonna be okay?

800
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:40,968
Yeah, I'll live.

801
00:46:42,777 --> 00:46:43,923
Let's talk about you.

802
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:44,757
No.

803
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:49,257
Have you decided if
you're gonna get treatment?

804
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:51,695
Okay, let's do this.

805
00:46:51,696 --> 00:46:54,822
We are going to write a bucket list.

806
00:46:54,823 --> 00:46:57,263
- A bucket list?
- Uh-huh.

807
00:46:57,264 --> 00:46:59,347
And Andrew is at the top.

808
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:02,864
Wait, what?

809
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,365
Lover or friend?

810
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,213
You're totally tapping that ass.

811
00:47:07,214 --> 00:47:09,334
No, no I'm not.

812
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:10,940
- Tapping...
- No.

813
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:12,358
- The ass.
- Stop.

814
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:16,954
- I'm not.
- Number one.

815
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:49,560
Hey, whoa, what the fuck are you doing?

816
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:50,561
Well?

817
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,529
I'm not dealing with
this shit any longer.

818
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,697
Now it's your turn to make a decision.

819
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:05,780
You wanna leave me?

820
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,609
I should.

821
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,298
Especially after last night
but I'm gonna let you decide.

822
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:13,674
I've already got your stuff packed.

823
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:16,266
Bags by the door, so, if you
wanna drink your life away

824
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:19,596
like your dad, get your shit and get out.

825
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:32,346
Or?

826
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:36,876
Or keep pouring and you can unpack

827
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:39,973
and really get help this time.

828
00:48:39,974 --> 00:48:44,057
It's your choice, but I'm
not doing this anymore.

829
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:54,034
All of it?

830
00:48:55,074 --> 00:48:56,574
Every last drop.

831
00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:00,308
Well, what's it gonna be?

832
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:08,519
Glad you can make it in, Faith.

833
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:21,230
So tell me what's on your mind.

834
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:29,893
So you're back?

835
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:33,273
Ready to talk?

836
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:36,794
Nope, not right now, I'm tired.

837
00:49:36,795 --> 00:49:39,515
Yeah, I know the feeling.

838
00:49:39,516 --> 00:49:41,608
Another sleepless night?

839
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:43,895
Doesn't help I was
sleeping on the couch.

840
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:48,716
Didn't have my meds, plus I
sleep better when I'm with you.

841
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:49,716
You know that.

842
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,024
You miss me?

843
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:52,025
Of course.

844
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:54,036
I love you.

845
00:49:55,056 --> 00:49:56,056
I love us.

846
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:59,717
We really need to talk.

847
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:03,414
I love you too, Avery,
but not right now.

848
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:04,866
We both need to be in a better mood

849
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:07,367
for this conversation to work.

850
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:11,504
I'm headed to the spa with my girlfriends,

851
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:14,365
I'll feel more refreshed when I get home.

852
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:16,192
And then maybe I can make
you your favorite dinner

853
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:19,026
and we can have a talk then, okay?

854
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:21,877
Yeah.

855
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:26,041
Go take your meds and try

856
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,375
to take a nap while I'm out.

857
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,914
- Baby.
- Don't

858
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:40,748
baby me, I need to know
what your decision is.

859
00:50:41,712 --> 00:50:43,715
I've stuck by you through hell, Shawn

860
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:46,341
this shit doesn't get
you through anything.

861
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:52,239
Is it gonna be me or the door?

862
00:50:58,458 --> 00:50:59,458
You, babe.

863
00:51:00,548 --> 00:51:01,631
I choose you.

864
00:51:03,549 --> 00:51:06,011
What, so, I'm the boogie man now?

865
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:08,952
Yeah, you'd be the cutest one ever.

866
00:51:08,953 --> 00:51:11,602
Plus you've fought so many battles for me.

867
00:51:11,603 --> 00:51:14,743
But I can't keep fighting
these battles all alone anymore.

868
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:15,667
I need you to help me.

869
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:16,526
Yeah.

870
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,432
If you're not capable
of fighting I'm done.

871
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:20,542
I swear I'll walk out right
now and never come back.

872
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:21,543
Okay.

873
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:28,832
Let's do it together, huh?

874
00:51:43,436 --> 00:51:45,103
What do you think?

875
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,126
What do I think?

876
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:52,183
I think you need to
figure out what you think.

877
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:55,326
You seem to be living in the
shadow of doubt and fear.

878
00:51:55,327 --> 00:52:00,013
And frankly, I don't believe
you know what you believe.

879
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:01,674
He says he didn't do it.

880
00:52:01,675 --> 00:52:03,444
We know what he thinks.

881
00:52:03,445 --> 00:52:06,585
The better question is, why
do you believe otherwise?

882
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:08,715
Now I don't doubt that something happened

883
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:11,345
to you when you were younger
but why do you believe

884
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:13,763
that he's the root of it all?

885
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:16,311
I don't know.

886
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,014
It's the only thing that makes sense.

887
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:21,301
He's my older brother.

888
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:25,054
When I was younger,
wherever I was, he was too.

889
00:52:25,055 --> 00:52:27,654
I think you're trying to
force this idea on yourself

890
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:29,822
so that things make sense.

891
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:35,663
Maybe we should dig a little deeper.

892
00:52:35,664 --> 00:52:37,514
I don't think so.

893
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:39,784
Do you have any
evidence that he's the one

894
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:42,036
that physically hurt you?

895
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,253
Do you have any recollection
of him being anything

896
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,222
but kind to you?

897
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:47,623
Because you've told me several stories

898
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:51,266
of the two of you together
with no blackouts.

899
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:54,145
And yet the only thing that's reoccurring

900
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:58,423
is that your blackouts occurred
during a family function.

901
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:00,924
Think about that for a minute.

902
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,223
Do you think he was
trying to protect me?

903
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:07,641
Okay, Faith, but protect you from whom?

904
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:12,430
I don't remember.

905
00:53:14,426 --> 00:53:17,421
I need you to remember
your past family events.

906
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:19,183
Let's go over who attended them

907
00:53:19,184 --> 00:53:22,184
and your relationship with them now.

908
00:53:26,175 --> 00:53:27,342
You're late.

909
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,983
That was rude.

910
00:53:29,984 --> 00:53:34,067
Well, you're cutting
into my conversation time.

911
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:36,986
Shall we?

912
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,173
What, Av?

913
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:44,846
You promised we would talk.

914
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,855
And I have a lot to say.

915
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,916
So what is it?

916
00:53:54,866 --> 00:53:59,366
I just want you to understand
where I'm coming from.

917
00:54:00,277 --> 00:54:01,698
You know how I told you it was just me

918
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:04,032
and my mom when I was young?

919
00:54:05,638 --> 00:54:07,805
It wasn't always that way.

920
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,696
My dad was a meth head.

921
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:16,192
And when I was about four,

922
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:21,908
he was in the basement with his friend,

923
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:27,072
he freaked out, beating
on his friend and left.

924
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:32,036
I found the body.

925
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:35,846
I never heard from my dad again.

926
00:54:37,977 --> 00:54:40,034
I didn't know.

927
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:41,702
I know you didn't.

928
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:46,907
I wasn't sure if I'd be
able to share this with you.

929
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:52,581
I wanted you to know I'm
excited for this baby.

930
00:54:54,414 --> 00:54:59,081
To show my kid that I'll be
the dad my father never was.

931
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,975
He was on drugs, he didn't
know what he was doing.

932
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,726
He never came back.

933
00:55:06,964 --> 00:55:11,224
I spent enough sleepless
nights waiting up for him.

934
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,392
I should know.

935
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:17,075
So is he the cause for your insomnia?

936
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:26,633
Fine, Av, I'll think about it, okay?

937
00:55:28,364 --> 00:55:31,884
I'm going to the doctor
to go over everything

938
00:55:31,885 --> 00:55:34,552
before I make my final decision.

939
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:36,404
Thanks.

940
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:43,331
Thank you for hearing me out.

941
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:47,565
Is it okay if I come with you?

942
00:55:50,937 --> 00:55:52,020
Hey, Jimmy.

943
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:54,804
How's it going?

944
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:02,090
It's a little tough,
but getting through it.

945
00:56:03,295 --> 00:56:04,922
How you doing, Sophia?

946
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:06,203
I'm doing good.

947
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:08,733
You know, it's been tough here too.

948
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:10,731
Tony says hello, by the way.

949
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:12,495
He just got a new place.

950
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:13,665
You should really stop by.

951
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:15,317
I will.

952
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:16,318
Good.

953
00:56:18,405 --> 00:56:21,238
Hey, what unit where you in again?

954
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:25,005
6th Marine Division, why?

955
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,024
That's what I thought.

956
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:28,613
We just got a new guy from that same one.

957
00:56:28,614 --> 00:56:29,781
Robert McNeil.

958
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:34,530
Robert McNeil.

959
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:36,855
You know him?

960
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:40,504
Yeah, we served together.

961
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:43,317
I kind of lost touch after I left.

962
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:44,455
Do me a favor?

963
00:56:44,456 --> 00:56:45,882
Wait for me there.

964
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:46,883
Yeah.

965
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:52,597
Forgive me, Rose,

966
00:56:52,598 --> 00:56:54,094
but I haven't had sex in 15 years

967
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:57,054
and it's starting to get on my nerves.

968
00:56:57,055 --> 00:56:58,683
I can't believe you watched this show.

969
00:56:58,684 --> 00:57:00,346
- It's so stupid.
- It's good.

970
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:02,804
No, it's not.

971
00:57:02,805 --> 00:57:03,933
Hello?

972
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:07,119
Got a call from County Jail.

973
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,953
County Jail?

974
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,003
Yeah?

975
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:16,228
Shawn, my man, I need you.

976
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,306
Come down and bail me out.

977
00:57:17,307 --> 00:57:19,279
Dude, what are you doing in jail?

978
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,303
There may have been,

979
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:23,873
leaving a bad clip to his car,
but no one's hurt, I swear.

980
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,631
Promise you, man, I'll get dry.

981
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:26,632
All right.

982
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,710
I'll be there in about an hour.

983
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:31,042
If you can get here any faster,

984
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:32,064
I'll owe you, man.

985
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,679
Mother fucker, you already owe me.

986
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,513
All right, hang tight.

987
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:41,230
Everything okay?

988
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:42,231
Yeah.

989
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:45,758
It's just Neil's fucking drama.

990
00:57:45,759 --> 00:57:47,426
I'm gonna get going.

991
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,268
I'll be back soon.

992
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,577
Don't let me know how it ends.

993
00:57:58,578 --> 00:58:00,161
Okay, be careful.

994
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:08,401
I don't want no visitors.

995
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:12,551
Yeah, I said the same damn thing

996
00:58:12,552 --> 00:58:14,385
when I first got here.

997
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,572
No way these civilians
could relate to two fucks

998
00:58:17,573 --> 00:58:19,743
of what I was going through.

999
00:58:19,744 --> 00:58:21,211
You work here?

1000
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:22,993
No, McDonald, if I worked here,

1001
00:58:22,994 --> 00:58:26,077
I'd wind up in the same chair as you.

1002
00:58:27,009 --> 00:58:28,009
McDonald?

1003
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,012
Jim Beam, is that you?

1004
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:33,013
Ooh-rah!

1005
00:58:37,283 --> 00:58:41,033
Surprised you didn't
recognize me, my friend.

1006
00:58:42,196 --> 00:58:45,878
I do have some more hair these days.

1007
00:58:45,879 --> 00:58:48,051
I recognize your voice.

1008
00:58:48,052 --> 00:58:50,969
It's been a while since I heard it.

1009
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:56,181
I can't see you, but
I can tell your lying.

1010
00:58:56,182 --> 00:58:58,599
You're probably ugly as ever.

1011
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:05,062
Yeah.

1012
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,371
So how's life treating you?

1013
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:10,872
It's been free pretty rough.

1014
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:15,117
I'm expecting a baby.

1015
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,118
A baby?

1016
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:17,918
Well, that's good news, man.

1017
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:19,252
Congratulations.

1018
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,987
Hell, I'm surprised you
actually found somebody

1019
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:24,988
to have a baby with you.

1020
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,188
Rebekah's pretty damn awesome.

1021
00:59:32,189 --> 00:59:33,189
Yeah?

1022
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:38,130
Then life's not as bad as you think it is.

1023
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:42,157
You've got your eyes.

1024
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:43,908
Got a kid on the way.

1025
00:59:45,022 --> 00:59:50,022
So from where I'm sitting,
that seems pretty damn good.

1026
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:53,488
Seriously, MacDonald, how you doing?

1027
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:58,277
Same old Jim Beam.

1028
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:00,111
Straight to the point.

1029
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:02,711
And I...

1030
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,377
I've been having more bad days than good.

1031
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:11,878
What happened to your eyes?

1032
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:14,687
Some dumb fuck trying to be a hero,

1033
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:16,438
set off a goddam IED.

1034
01:00:19,469 --> 01:00:23,219
Remember I was running
radio with my squad.

1035
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:27,868
All I had on me was my damn M-9.

1036
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:30,479
Oo-rah, M-9.

1037
01:00:34,887 --> 01:00:38,366
You gotta have two hands for that shit.

1038
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:42,514
We're lucky if the
fucking thing don't jam.

1039
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,348
You talking to anyone?

1040
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:48,589
I'm always talking to people.

1041
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:51,146
It seems in here, they don't trust me

1042
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,897
to be alone with my own thoughts.

1043
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:00,953
Yeah, I know it.

1044
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:08,395
I remember my first couple of
weeks were my roughest too.

1045
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:17,695
You know, they're just
looking out for you, right?

1046
01:01:17,696 --> 01:01:18,696
Yeah.

1047
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:22,289
You listen to me.

1048
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:24,566
Listen to me.

1049
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:29,722
This shouldn't be the end of the road.

1050
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:32,223
Despite the shit we got dealt.

1051
01:01:33,293 --> 01:01:34,293
You hear me?

1052
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,819
Now we gonna fight this thing.

1053
01:01:40,952 --> 01:01:43,102
We're gonna fight this thing.

1054
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:44,103
You hear me?

1055
01:01:45,192 --> 01:01:46,359
The two of us.

1056
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:54,239
Ooh-rah!

1057
01:01:55,564 --> 01:01:56,564
Ooh-rah!

1058
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,603
Dude, slow down.

1059
01:02:01,604 --> 01:02:02,842
Why are you so mad?

1060
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:04,926
We should be celebrating.

1061
01:02:05,873 --> 01:02:07,521
Are you really that dense?

1062
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:09,309
I just bailed you out of
jail and now you're talking

1063
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,753
about how you wanna celebrate?

1064
01:02:11,754 --> 01:02:12,934
I'm a free man.

1065
01:02:12,935 --> 01:02:14,481
I'm out of jail, I'm not going back.

1066
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:17,601
No, no dude, you've gotta show up, okay?

1067
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:18,803
I've got money behind you.

1068
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:21,020
That's the behind mine and Ellies car.

1069
01:02:21,021 --> 01:02:22,071
What's the big deal?

1070
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,381
You get another car, you get another girl.

1071
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:27,299
Come on, man, I'll buy you a drink.

1072
01:02:34,662 --> 01:02:35,662
Hey, El.

1073
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:38,253
Hey, babe, I
just called to let you know

1074
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,551
I put an apple pie in the oven.

1075
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:42,661
God, that's my favorite.

1076
01:02:42,662 --> 01:02:43,495
I know.

1077
01:02:43,495 --> 01:02:44,328
I love you.

1078
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:45,781
I love you too.

1079
01:02:45,782 --> 01:02:48,008
All right, I'll see you soon.

1080
01:02:48,009 --> 01:02:49,372
See the leash has got a little tighter.

1081
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:50,983
Will you stop with that shit!

1082
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,067
Come on, man.

1083
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:55,130
You know what, I wasn't
gonna bail you out this time.

1084
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:56,464
I really wasn't.

1085
01:02:57,802 --> 01:02:59,313
Then why did you?

1086
01:02:59,314 --> 01:03:01,759
Because my girlfriend, you know the one

1087
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,311
that you hate so much,
she told me to use our car

1088
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:06,729
as collateral to get you out.

1089
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,352
She didn't want me to turn
my back on my best friend.

1090
01:03:13,353 --> 01:03:16,520
You were gonna turn your back on me?

1091
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:20,552
God, you're such an idiot, dude.

1092
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,271
You clipped a car, man.

1093
01:03:23,272 --> 01:03:25,447
You sent someone to the hospital.

1094
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:30,028
No one fucking got hurt,
are you fucking serious?

1095
01:03:30,029 --> 01:03:32,112
Do you not feel anything?

1096
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:35,769
I can't believe you were
gonna leave me in jail.

1097
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,353
I mean, I feel bad.

1098
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,857
You know what?

1099
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:42,468
I'll feel better after I have a whiskey.

1100
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:43,469
Come on.

1101
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,012
Call a cab.

1102
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:50,438
I'm going home to my girl.

1103
01:03:50,439 --> 01:03:52,667
You gotta get your shit together, man.

1104
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:53,835
- Shawn?
- Nah.

1105
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:05,274
Oh, thank you.

1106
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:14,148
Waiting for someone?

1107
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:15,980
Yeah, I'm waiting for a blind date.

1108
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:17,170
A blind date?

1109
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:18,618
Since when does a beautiful woman like you

1110
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:20,290
need to go on blind dates?

1111
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:22,986
You must have a lot of
men begging at your feet.

1112
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:24,407
I wish.

1113
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:26,420
What century are you from?

1114
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:29,410
The kind that brings a beautiful woman

1115
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,828
a beautiful rose.

1116
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:33,556
Pasqual.

1117
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:35,665
I hope you are satisfied?

1118
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:37,052
No, it's cute.

1119
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:38,062
I'm still intrigued.

1120
01:04:38,063 --> 01:04:39,783
Intrigued.

1121
01:04:39,784 --> 01:04:41,313
I can work with that.

1122
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:43,270
But let me tell you,
you should be really mad

1123
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:46,351
at Soraya, 'cause that
picture she showed of you,

1124
01:04:46,352 --> 01:04:49,435
huh-uh, you look sexier in real life.

1125
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:52,978
Thank you.

1126
01:04:52,979 --> 01:04:55,338
So why are you single and on a blind date?

1127
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:59,258
Well, sadly not a lot of woman
can keep up with my energy.

1128
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:02,426
I'm a lot to handle but well worth it.

1129
01:05:04,228 --> 01:05:06,772
Ah, what do you mean by a lot to handle?

1130
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:08,458
Hold that, please.

1131
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:09,570
Don't worry.

1132
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:11,188
In due time, my love.

1133
01:05:11,189 --> 01:05:15,210
I have a feeling we'll get to
know a lot more of each other.

1134
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,211
Please.

1135
01:05:23,332 --> 01:05:24,812
You smell really good.

1136
01:05:24,813 --> 01:05:26,108
Excuse me.

1137
01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:28,308
Don't worry, it's a compliment.

1138
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:29,972
Didn't mean to offend you,

1139
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:33,428
this just look good enough to eat.

1140
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,279
Delicious.

1141
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,742
You compliment every
woman you meet that way?

1142
01:05:37,743 --> 01:05:40,410
Only the ones that deserve it.

1143
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:43,118
You seem a little nervous, baby.

1144
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,932
Are you ready for your next drink?

1145
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:48,016
Ur, no, this one's fine, thank you.

1146
01:05:48,973 --> 01:05:51,961
Look, I think we got off the wrong foot.

1147
01:05:51,962 --> 01:05:54,629
How about I take you to my place

1148
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,090
with dance salsa all night long,

1149
01:05:57,091 --> 01:05:59,308
I'll make you breakfast.

1150
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:01,741
How does that sound?

1151
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:03,368
That'll be a no.

1152
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:04,863
Considering I just met you,

1153
01:06:04,864 --> 01:06:07,252
I don't feel comfortable
going home with you tonight.

1154
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:09,022
- So.
- Oh, baby.

1155
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,807
You wouldn't be the first
girl I take home at night

1156
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:13,928
and you most certainly
won't be the last one.

1157
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,512
It's your loss.

1158
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,161
No, it's your loss.

1159
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:20,995
So, cool off.

1160
01:06:21,963 --> 01:06:25,213
Cool off.

1161
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:31,599
Don't worry, she got nervous, baby.

1162
01:06:39,772 --> 01:06:41,399
I need your help.

1163
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,263
I need to get better.

1164
01:06:43,264 --> 01:06:44,543
You are getting there.

1165
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:45,690
It just takes time.

1166
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:46,961
No, no, no, it's not enough.

1167
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:49,289
I need to get better faster.

1168
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,540
What's the cause of this new urgency?

1169
01:06:54,253 --> 01:06:55,253
Rebekah.

1170
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:03,123
Apparently I had a nightmare
and I choked her in my sleep.

1171
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:10,192
I can't do that shit anymore.

1172
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,645
I can't do that with the baby.

1173
01:07:12,646 --> 01:07:14,300
I need you to put me under right now.

1174
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:15,301
Now!

1175
01:07:16,654 --> 01:07:18,237
Okay, I'll do it.

1176
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:23,510
But there's no quick fix for any of this.

1177
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:35,164
Fox Three, you're too
far from our location.

1178
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:43,530
Alpha One, could you please,

1179
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:45,678
could you please eyes on Foxtrot?

1180
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:52,684
Fox Three, come in.

1181
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:55,174
Come in, Fox Three!

1182
01:08:02,383 --> 01:08:04,216
I tried to get backup.

1183
01:08:05,872 --> 01:08:09,289
But, until we get eyes, nothing's moving.

1184
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:33,670
My best friend was Fox Three.

1185
01:08:35,204 --> 01:08:38,621
We were both radio ops for our fire team.

1186
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,124
I was working with the command.

1187
01:08:49,232 --> 01:08:51,565
We had one mission that day.

1188
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,797
Hide and seek.

1189
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,283
We lost Foxtrot.

1190
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:07,894
Everyone.

1191
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:17,404
I tried to help my buddy

1192
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:23,021
but no one was, no one was doing anything.

1193
01:09:23,022 --> 01:09:24,689
No one was reacting.

1194
01:09:29,062 --> 01:09:32,979
I knew that it wasn't
safe, but fuck that shit.

1195
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,133
We made a promise.

1196
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:39,543
We made a promise.

1197
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:42,689
Everyone in, everyone out.

1198
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:49,860
Why do you think you keep
reliving that night, Jimmy?

1199
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:52,058
I pay you to tell me.

1200
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:57,021
In your dream, why
were you so frightened?

1201
01:09:58,912 --> 01:10:00,100
Could it be the baby?

1202
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:02,313
No, no, no, no, no, it's not baby.

1203
01:10:02,314 --> 01:10:04,212
I'm not afraid of the baby.

1204
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:07,380
Rebekah says I'm gonna be a great dad.

1205
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:12,152
It's just a lot to process.

1206
01:10:12,153 --> 01:10:14,382
I believe you're
gonna be a great dad too

1207
01:10:14,383 --> 01:10:17,716
but deep down inside, I think you don't.

1208
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:21,333
Here's what I'm interpreting.

1209
01:10:21,334 --> 01:10:23,855
You start off in a child's room,

1210
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:25,974
presumably your daughter.

1211
01:10:25,975 --> 01:10:30,225
Invisible bullets rain down
and you feel bombarded.

1212
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:35,076
Then, so out of place, you're
lost in the middle of nowhere.

1213
01:10:35,077 --> 01:10:36,463
You lose yourself.

1214
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:38,633
You don't know where your head's at.

1215
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,186
And your biggest fear is
that you won't be able

1216
01:10:41,187 --> 01:10:43,764
to react the way you need to.

1217
01:10:43,765 --> 01:10:46,602
The way you want to in an emergency.

1218
01:10:46,603 --> 01:10:49,493
What are your thoughts on that?

1219
01:10:49,494 --> 01:10:51,661
I tried to help somebody

1220
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:54,085
and I killed them.

1221
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:05,005
This is a baby.

1222
01:11:06,946 --> 01:11:07,946
Right?

1223
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:13,406
It's totally dependent on me.

1224
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:17,639
Just defenseless.

1225
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:19,949
Unprotected.

1226
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,234
Just me.

1227
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,515
What about Rebekah?

1228
01:11:22,516 --> 01:11:26,317
No, no, Rebekah's not
trained for that shit!

1229
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:28,818
I was and I still failed them.

1230
01:11:30,405 --> 01:11:32,043
When you went to war Jimmy,

1231
01:11:32,044 --> 01:11:34,664
you had to prepare yourself.

1232
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,126
Try to think of this as a different war

1233
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,433
with different tools.

1234
01:11:39,434 --> 01:11:42,601
You were trained to be a good soldier.

1235
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,958
You are a good protector.

1236
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,064
No one's perfect.

1237
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:52,933
Okay, fine, then to tell
the goddam fucking ghosts

1238
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:56,517
to get out of my head
and shut the fuck up.

1239
01:11:57,483 --> 01:11:59,823
The war never ends.

1240
01:11:59,824 --> 01:12:01,991
My war will never be over.

1241
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:10,464
Life is full of big decisions.

1242
01:12:10,465 --> 01:12:13,093
But you put yourself in
extraordinary circumstances

1243
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:14,177
and got hurt.

1244
01:12:16,055 --> 01:12:18,033
You'll always have the bullets in war.

1245
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,274
I can't take that away from you.

1246
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:24,358
But I wanna help you find
the love, pain, failure

1247
01:12:25,364 --> 01:12:27,781
and learn how to get back up.

1248
01:12:35,975 --> 01:12:37,753
It's Rebekah.

1249
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:39,315
You seem calmer now.

1250
01:12:39,316 --> 01:12:42,374
How are you feeling about Rebekah?

1251
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:44,934
I still feel like throwing up.

1252
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:46,246
You're still afraid

1253
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:49,830
because you believe
you failed your friend.

1254
01:12:52,124 --> 01:12:53,124
Yeah, so?

1255
01:12:54,464 --> 01:12:56,764
You operate as a team.

1256
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:58,684
You work as a team.

1257
01:12:58,685 --> 01:12:59,803
I wasn't there.

1258
01:12:59,804 --> 01:13:03,092
I didn't feel what you felt
but I sure as hell know,

1259
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:05,742
you were obeying your Commander.

1260
01:13:05,743 --> 01:13:09,323
Those simple orders he gave
you took away the pressure

1261
01:13:09,324 --> 01:13:11,764
but not the responsibility.

1262
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:14,606
No matter how you look at
what happened that day,

1263
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:17,113
you never had control.

1264
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:19,055
If you would've disobeyed your Commander

1265
01:13:19,056 --> 01:13:20,773
you would've risked your own life.

1266
01:13:20,774 --> 01:13:23,551
Leaving your unit in the dark.

1267
01:13:23,552 --> 01:13:26,572
You'll have to realize that some things

1268
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:29,490
will always be out of your control.

1269
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,584
- And if I can't?
- You can.

1270
01:13:33,585 --> 01:13:35,544
Because whenever you feel like you can't,

1271
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:38,628
you're gonna take Rebekah up dancing.

1272
01:13:40,026 --> 01:13:42,414
What's with the dancing?

1273
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:45,782
When I was younger,
I broke both of my legs

1274
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:48,254
and not being able to
use them for so long,

1275
01:13:48,255 --> 01:13:50,532
I was afraid to try to walk again.

1276
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:54,134
I was afraid I wouldn't remember how.

1277
01:13:54,135 --> 01:13:57,703
My dad, he knew how much I like to dance

1278
01:13:57,704 --> 01:14:00,555
so he picked me up and put me on his feet.

1279
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:03,056
And then he'd moved me in a circle.

1280
01:14:03,057 --> 01:14:05,244
It was like I was flying.

1281
01:14:05,245 --> 01:14:07,685
I began to dance with him on my own

1282
01:14:07,686 --> 01:14:11,013
and I forgot I was even walking.

1283
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:12,895
Lost in the moment.

1284
01:14:12,896 --> 01:14:14,813
All my fears were gone.

1285
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:17,553
I took control back.

1286
01:14:19,215 --> 01:14:21,345
And I want you to forget
what's in your head

1287
01:14:21,346 --> 01:14:23,013
as best you can.

1288
01:14:23,014 --> 01:14:25,103
I want you to find the strength

1289
01:14:25,104 --> 01:14:27,684
to lead Rebekah on that dance floor

1290
01:14:27,685 --> 01:14:29,518
and take control back.

1291
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:34,505
I believe everything will fall into place.

1292
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,477
Come on.

1293
01:14:43,457 --> 01:14:44,457
Come on.

1294
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,903
Feel the beat.

1295
01:14:53,006 --> 01:14:55,304
Move to the rhythm.

1296
01:14:55,305 --> 01:14:57,638
Loose yourself to the music.

1297
01:14:59,053 --> 01:15:02,485
See, it's a great form of meditation.

1298
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,974
That's it.

1299
01:15:04,975 --> 01:15:06,856
Dip me, Jimmy.

1300
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:07,765
Dip me.

1301
01:15:07,765 --> 01:15:08,765
I trust you.

1302
01:15:14,254 --> 01:15:15,795
See.

1303
01:15:15,796 --> 01:15:16,879
You got this.

1304
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:22,866
I was safe in your arms and
so will Rebekah and your baby.

1305
01:15:25,157 --> 01:15:26,157
All right.

1306
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,364
Thank you.

1307
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:30,782
You're welcome.

1308
01:15:37,968 --> 01:15:40,766
He said that I smelled delicious.

1309
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,278
He really said that?

1310
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,537
- He really said that?
- Yes.

1311
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:49,015
Wow.

1312
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:52,338
What a misogynistic cock-sucker.

1313
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,339
Jule!

1314
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:57,526
I'm just saying.

1315
01:15:57,527 --> 01:16:00,086
I know, he totally was.

1316
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:01,396
I didn't think being back in the market

1317
01:16:01,397 --> 01:16:03,046
would be this difficult.

1318
01:16:03,047 --> 01:16:04,846
Hmm, completely.

1319
01:16:04,847 --> 01:16:09,347
But luckily I don't deal
with dip-shits like that, so.

1320
01:16:15,607 --> 01:16:17,357
Is everything okay?

1321
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,888
You know, I've been thinking it over

1322
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:26,639
and I think I'm gonna give
myself another week to decide.

1323
01:16:28,997 --> 01:16:31,080
Who's holding you back.

1324
01:16:38,578 --> 01:16:40,549
It's Andrew.

1325
01:16:41,886 --> 01:16:42,969
- No.
- Oh, yes.

1326
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:47,128
Okay, so I'm gonna go.

1327
01:16:47,129 --> 01:16:48,546
Let me have this.

1328
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:53,271
You let me know if you need anything.

1329
01:16:54,258 --> 01:16:56,137
Now get laid.

1330
01:16:56,138 --> 01:16:57,138
Oh, god.

1331
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:00,619
Bye.

1332
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:17,087
So I was thinking of calling, Chance.

1333
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:18,797
I went to a different
therapist and they said

1334
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:22,465
that maybe my dreams
were interpreted wrong.

1335
01:17:24,716 --> 01:17:26,167
Really?

1336
01:17:26,168 --> 01:17:28,668
I mean, why would you do that?

1337
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:32,525
Don't you remember him hurting you?

1338
01:17:32,526 --> 01:17:35,544
Isn't that what the other therapist said.

1339
01:17:35,545 --> 01:17:38,287
I don't remember anything.

1340
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:41,155
All I know is that in spaces of darkness,

1341
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,766
he's there before and after
but I also have plenty

1342
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:48,143
of memories with just the two of us.

1343
01:17:48,144 --> 01:17:51,076
Why would he not try to
hurt me when we're alone?

1344
01:17:51,077 --> 01:17:52,646
It doesn't make sense.

1345
01:17:52,647 --> 01:17:54,702
It makes sense to me.

1346
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,870
He fucked with your brain.

1347
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,574
I don't know, Faith.

1348
01:18:05,575 --> 01:18:07,908
I don't like him around you.

1349
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,607
He doesn't like you either.

1350
01:18:10,608 --> 01:18:13,796
He didn't even have a chance
to defend himself this morning.

1351
01:18:13,797 --> 01:18:16,664
You kicked him out as soon as I asked.

1352
01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:19,575
Because I'm your protector now.

1353
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,159
I'm protecting you.

1354
01:18:22,255 --> 01:18:25,775
What do you have against Chance?

1355
01:18:25,776 --> 01:18:27,576
Because he hurt you.

1356
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:33,075
But you didn't liked him before.

1357
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:35,659
You and Chance never got along.

1358
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:42,337
Uncle Vic, were you ever at
any of our family gatherings?

1359
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:45,294
Of course, I was at all of them.

1360
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:46,573
I never seem to remember you

1361
01:18:46,574 --> 01:18:49,241
at any of our family gatherings.

1362
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:54,067
And that therapist, the one I saw,

1363
01:18:55,036 --> 01:18:56,619
is she your friend?

1364
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:03,842
And my panic attacks, got
even worse after you moved in.

1365
01:19:09,597 --> 01:19:10,597
Faith.

1366
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:15,921
My sweet little Faith.

1367
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:23,416
There was always this innocence about you.

1368
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:30,141
Every time I came over, you
were so happy to see me.

1369
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:33,550
You loved me.

1370
01:19:36,089 --> 01:19:38,968
You were always so happy
to see your Uncle Vic.

1371
01:19:43,798 --> 01:19:45,465
You loved Uncle Vic.

1372
01:20:07,825 --> 01:20:09,996
Yeah, I mean, it's mostly just a like...

1373
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:14,735
Are you gonna get that?

1374
01:20:14,736 --> 01:20:17,403
Ur, nah, that's not important.

1375
01:20:18,967 --> 01:20:20,154
Hey, what's up.

1376
01:20:20,155 --> 01:20:21,236
It's Chance.

1377
01:20:21,237 --> 01:20:22,225
Leave a message.

1378
01:20:22,226 --> 01:20:23,448
Hey, Chance.

1379
01:20:23,449 --> 01:20:25,624
I'm so sorry, I was wrong.

1380
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:27,535
It was Victor.

1381
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:29,677
I don't remember but he knows I know

1382
01:20:29,678 --> 01:20:31,737
and now he's at the door.

1383
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:32,988
Please help me.

1384
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,468
Faith, come on.

1385
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:44,636
You want this.

1386
01:20:45,978 --> 01:20:46,978
You lie!

1387
01:21:03,619 --> 01:21:05,265
We need to talk.

1388
01:21:05,266 --> 01:21:06,266
Okay.

1389
01:21:07,044 --> 01:21:10,947
Why you being ignoring
all of my phone calls?

1390
01:21:10,948 --> 01:21:12,698
You need to get that?

1391
01:21:15,027 --> 01:21:17,694
Um, I can call her back later.

1392
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,750
Let's talk.

1393
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,815
Julie.

1394
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:28,899
I killed him.

1395
01:21:31,776 --> 01:21:33,776
I don't know what to do.

1396
01:21:41,406 --> 01:21:44,764
I'm glad you haven't given up yet.

1397
01:21:44,765 --> 01:21:47,187
Well, I don't wanna roll over and die

1398
01:21:47,188 --> 01:21:49,688
when I have a lot to live for.

1399
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:53,297
I agree.

1400
01:21:53,977 --> 01:21:55,989
You do have a lot to live for.

1401
01:22:09,796 --> 01:22:10,988
Wait.

1402
01:22:10,989 --> 01:22:13,017
No, don't, don't think.

1403
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:14,518

I want you to get better.

1411
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:39,514
I do, I'm so sorry.

1412
01:22:39,515 --> 01:22:42,098
You do not have to apologize.

1413
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,166
You love me.

1414
01:22:45,775 --> 01:22:47,358
Despite my baggage.

1415
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,625
I wanna take you out.

1416
01:22:53,914 --> 01:22:54,914
Dancing.

1417
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,972
Can I do that?

1418
01:22:59,347 --> 01:23:00,347
Yeah.

1419
01:23:02,093 --> 01:23:04,980
I'm wanna try something.

1420
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:06,814
I think you'd like it.

1421
01:23:08,934 --> 01:23:11,710
Now let's get you off to bed.

1422
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:12,711
Huh-uh.

1423
01:23:36,673 --> 01:23:38,923
Hey, where are you going?

1424
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:42,123
Well, there's a couch in the living room

1425
01:23:42,124 --> 01:23:43,707
with my name on it.

1426
01:23:50,623 --> 01:23:53,373
Don't worry, it's just temporary.

1427
01:23:54,622 --> 01:23:58,205
Until I can trust myself
to sleep with you.

1428
01:23:59,362 --> 01:24:00,221
Goodnight.

1429
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:01,221
Goodnight.

1430
01:25:22,803 --> 01:25:25,453
911, what's the
location of your emergency?

1431
01:25:40,462 --> 01:25:41,462
Hey.

1432
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:43,711
How'd it go?

1433
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:45,589
Is everything all right?

1434
01:25:45,589 --> 01:25:46,469
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1435
01:25:46,469 --> 01:25:47,302
Yeah.

1436
01:25:47,302 --> 01:25:48,302
Look.

1437
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:50,897
I see.

1438
01:25:50,898 --> 01:25:52,663
You made some pie?

1439
01:25:52,664 --> 01:25:55,927
- It's your favorite.
- It is my favorite.

1440
01:25:55,928 --> 01:25:57,644
I see you've got some here.

1441
01:25:57,645 --> 01:25:58,764
- I do?
- Yeah.

1442
01:25:58,765 --> 01:26:02,932
- And here, and here, and here.
- I didn't know that.

1443
01:26:06,106 --> 01:26:07,606
What was that for?

1444
01:26:13,247 --> 01:26:14,247
I...

1445
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:20,328
I...

1446
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:22,258
I came to a decision today.

1447
01:26:22,259 --> 01:26:23,259
Okay.

1448
01:26:29,066 --> 01:26:30,825
I don't have a ring.

1449
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:32,986
But I'm gonna get you one.

1450
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:37,320
You deserve the biggest and
brightest one out there.

1451
01:26:38,438 --> 01:26:41,888
You've been here with me
through thick and thin

1452
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:46,424
and I don't think you understand
how much I appreciate you.

1453
01:26:46,425 --> 01:26:48,592
Ellie, I love you so much.

1454
01:26:52,097 --> 01:26:53,855
Would you make me the
happiest man on earth

1455
01:26:53,856 --> 01:26:55,936
and spend the rest of your life with me?

1456
01:26:55,937 --> 01:26:57,335
Would you marry me?

1457
01:26:57,336 --> 01:26:58,464
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1458
01:27:00,504 --> 01:27:01,518
I'm sorry.

1459
01:27:53,514 --> 01:27:54,514
Hello?

1460
01:27:57,275 --> 01:27:58,275
Chance.

1461
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:01,339
How did you get my number?

1462
01:28:03,246 --> 01:28:04,645
She's dead?

1463
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:08,909
What happened?

1464
01:28:11,855 --> 01:28:13,855
Okay, let me call Carly.

1465
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:17,166
I'll call you back soon.

1466
01:28:33,356 --> 01:28:34,439
I'm so sorry.

1467
01:28:35,545 --> 01:28:36,545
Don't be.

1468
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:47,363
I didn't answer.

1469
01:28:49,263 --> 01:28:50,884
I didn't know it was so important.

1470
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:53,023
No, no, no, it's okay.

1471
01:28:53,024 --> 01:28:54,186
You didn't know, you didn't know.

1472
01:28:54,187 --> 01:28:55,302
I didn't answer.

1473
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:59,214
Let's get dressed and
see what we need to do.

1474
01:28:59,215 --> 01:29:01,061
Do you need to call your
friend who was here last night?

1475
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:02,485
Yes.

1476
01:29:02,486 --> 01:29:04,986
Oh, she's gonna be devastated.

1477
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,300
Where do you need me?

1478
01:29:15,646 --> 01:29:17,646
I'm still dying, Andy.

1479
01:29:18,566 --> 01:29:19,566
I know.

1480
01:29:21,174 --> 01:29:25,251
But when I think about my
white picket fence days

1481
01:29:25,252 --> 01:29:28,035
and how afraid I am losing you,

1482
01:29:28,036 --> 01:29:29,869
I'm losing you anyway.

1483
01:29:32,036 --> 01:29:34,536
Neither of us can control why.

1484
01:29:37,185 --> 01:29:41,518
I want to spend the time
that I have lived with you.

1485
01:29:56,655 --> 01:29:59,672
Thank you for keeping an open mind.

1486
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:04,464
Harper.

1487
01:30:05,615 --> 01:30:06,951
Really?

1488
01:30:06,952 --> 01:30:09,522
You aren't joking, one of the mates.

1489
01:30:09,523 --> 01:30:11,273
This is my big break.

1490
01:30:14,424 --> 01:30:15,257
Was that Stacy?

1491
01:30:15,258 --> 01:30:17,272
She called to say I got the part.

1492
01:30:17,273 --> 01:30:18,523
I got the part!

1493
01:30:25,632 --> 01:30:26,882
I got the part.

1494
01:30:28,004 --> 01:30:29,004
I get it.

1495
01:30:31,591 --> 01:30:35,414
You can't keep the part with the baby.

1496
01:30:35,415 --> 01:30:37,454
Harp, I don't know if I can do this.

1497
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:38,455
I know.

1498
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,330
We want different things.

1499
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:52,010
And I don't wanna resent you.

1500
01:30:52,011 --> 01:30:54,011
- But if I stay...
- I know.

1501
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:00,234
I love you.

1502
01:31:05,763 --> 01:31:07,062
Goodbye, Harper.

1503
01:31:16,227 --> 01:31:20,146
It's been a rough week for some of us.

1504
01:31:20,147 --> 01:31:23,139
We've been fighting what life has dealt us

1505
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:26,223
and it hasn't been particularly kind.

1506
01:31:32,846 --> 01:31:36,807
We're having a small gathering
back here tomorrow night

1507
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:39,391
to celebrate the life of Faith.

1508
01:31:40,648 --> 01:31:44,716
I think it's a good
idea for us to celebrate

1509
01:31:44,717 --> 01:31:46,300
and to stay strong.

1510
01:31:47,626 --> 01:31:49,982
Everyone is welcome to come.

1511
01:31:52,746 --> 01:31:57,079
You all have been the
greatest family I've ever had.

1512
01:31:57,927 --> 01:32:00,427
I really hope you can make it.

1513
01:32:01,906 --> 01:32:05,008
I didn't really know Faith.

1514
01:32:05,009 --> 01:32:07,509
I mean, she's pretty new here.

1515
01:32:10,369 --> 01:32:14,454
But you guys helped me
with so many things,

1516
01:32:14,455 --> 01:32:16,038
you'd help me to...

1517
01:32:20,094 --> 01:32:22,511
To see the person I could be.

1518
01:32:24,775 --> 01:32:26,692
I really love you guys.

1519
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:31,567
See you guys tomorrow.

1520
01:32:42,007 --> 01:32:43,866
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1521
01:32:43,867 --> 01:32:48,867
What's wrong with
accepting a little bit of help?

1522
01:32:49,253 --> 01:32:50,693
Just stop it.

1523
01:32:50,694 --> 01:32:52,075
Stop what?

1524
01:32:52,076 --> 01:32:54,876
I can feel you staring at me.

1525
01:32:54,877 --> 01:32:59,127
I'm just waiting for you
to allow me to help you.

1526
01:33:05,384 --> 01:33:06,972
I'll leave you alone.

1527
01:33:06,973 --> 01:33:09,487
Just remember we're family.

1528
01:33:09,488 --> 01:33:12,317
Expecting to see you back here again.

1529
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:14,151
I'll think about it.

1530
01:33:15,307 --> 01:33:16,724
Straight ahead.

1531
01:33:20,816 --> 01:33:22,687
Julie, can you please
tell Jimmy he can go back

1532
01:33:22,688 --> 01:33:25,125
to sleeping with his girlfriend.

1533
01:33:25,126 --> 01:33:27,151
You're just saying that
'cause you want the couch.

1534
01:33:27,152 --> 01:33:29,801
I mean, I
can't lie, the floor sucks.

1535
01:33:29,802 --> 01:33:32,990
But seriously, dude, you
haven't made a peep all week.

1536
01:33:32,991 --> 01:33:35,345
Really, Avery, no nightmares?

1537
01:33:35,346 --> 01:33:36,929
Not a single one.

1538
01:33:38,753 --> 01:33:41,336
And I will meet you at the car.

1539
01:33:42,173 --> 01:33:43,173
All right.

1540
01:33:53,072 --> 01:33:54,472
You don't know what would've happened

1541
01:33:54,473 --> 01:33:56,806
if you picked up that phone.

1542
01:33:59,733 --> 01:34:03,534
Things might not have been any different.

1543
01:34:03,535 --> 01:34:04,535
Hey.

1544
01:34:06,545 --> 01:34:09,295
The girl was betrayed and damage.

1545
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:16,043
You can't put that kind of
weight on your shoulders.

1546
01:34:25,752 --> 01:34:27,752
I'm glad you chose life.

1547
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,750

1594
01:36:55,817 --> 01:36:58,036

1600
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:17,184
Jimmy, this whole dance was your idea.

1601
01:37:17,185 --> 01:37:20,367

01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,250
Are you okay?

1618
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:11,319
I'm fine.

1619
01:38:12,259 --> 01:38:14,140
You can stop worrying about me.

1620
01:38:14,141 --> 01:38:16,900
Nah, I'm always gonna worry about you.

1621
01:38:16,901 --> 01:38:17,901
Both of you.

1622
01:38:20,318 --> 01:38:21,985
Well, speaking of.

1623
01:38:23,078 --> 01:38:24,995
I saw the doctor today.

1624
01:38:26,216 --> 01:38:27,295
Everything okay?

1625
01:38:27,296 --> 01:38:28,963
Everything's fine.

1626
01:38:30,725 --> 01:38:31,725
Um...

1627
01:38:32,825 --> 01:38:37,658
They're both doing fine and
growing according to schedule.

1628
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:41,814
Both?

1629
01:38:43,358 --> 01:38:44,358
Twins!

1630
01:38:47,035 --> 01:38:48,535
Oh, two of them.

1631
01:38:49,836 --> 01:38:51,197
Are you okay?

1632
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:52,865
Can you handle this?

1633
01:38:54,997 --> 01:38:56,164
Two of them.

1634
01:38:58,947 --> 01:39:01,974
Yeah, I'm gonna work through this.

1635
01:39:01,975 --> 01:39:03,608
You trust me.

1636
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:05,165
Yeah.

1637
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:06,583
Do you trust you?

1638
01:39:10,405 --> 01:39:12,634
I think I'm getting there.

1639
01:39:12,635 --> 01:39:13,836
Good.

1640
01:39:13,837 --> 01:39:16,337
And I think this is helping.

1641
01:39:24,597 --> 01:39:26,064
Thank you for coming.

1642
01:39:26,065 --> 01:39:27,774
This looks fantastic.

1643
01:39:27,775 --> 01:39:30,488
It's a great celebration of
her, she'd have loved it.

1644
01:39:30,489 --> 01:39:31,489
I'm glad.

1645
01:39:32,317 --> 01:39:37,146
I was just about to go on
stage to say a few words.

1646
01:39:37,147 --> 01:39:38,351
Why don't you come with.

1647
01:39:38,352 --> 01:39:39,677
Oh, I...

1648
01:39:39,678 --> 01:39:40,678
Come on.

1649
01:39:52,817 --> 01:39:54,484
Attention, everyone.

1650
01:40:00,718 --> 01:40:05,301
We are here to celebrate the
life of Faith Angela Ninn.

1651
01:40:08,368 --> 01:40:10,535
Her initial spell out fan.

1652
01:40:11,475 --> 01:40:13,058
She was a favorite.

1653
01:40:16,409 --> 01:40:19,992
She was young and I
took to her right away.

1654
01:40:29,437 --> 01:40:32,770
I feel in some ways she'd still be alive

1655
01:40:33,957 --> 01:40:36,124
if we had have helped her.

1656
01:40:38,149 --> 01:40:40,792
She was a bright light.

1657
01:40:40,793 --> 01:40:43,835
A force to be reckoned with.

1658
01:40:45,628 --> 01:40:47,295
She was a lost soul.

1659
01:40:49,427 --> 01:40:53,177
And I wish I could've
been there to help her.

1660
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:02,000
She taught me about life.

1661
01:41:03,069 --> 01:41:05,236
I felt like I had nothing.

1662
01:41:06,738 --> 01:41:10,238
She made me feel useful in my uselessness.

1663
01:41:15,876 --> 01:41:19,376
We've all grown a little since we met her.

1664
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:28,328
I'm gonna pass the mic to her brother now.

1665
01:41:45,727 --> 01:41:48,318
Hey, I just want you to know

1666
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:50,278
that you're now our family.

1667
01:41:50,279 --> 01:41:51,279
Okay?

1668
01:41:52,165 --> 01:41:55,197
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good, all right.

1669
01:41:55,198 --> 01:41:57,317
I'm gonna be over here.

1670
01:41:57,318 --> 01:41:58,318
Okay.

1671
01:42:04,608 --> 01:42:07,907
You are all her family
when I couldn't be.

1672
01:42:07,908 --> 01:42:11,241
And I will forever be thankful for that.

1673
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:15,310
You brought us together

1674
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:18,393
and I didn't even know we were apart.

1675
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:24,076
You gave her the strength or the courage.

1676
01:42:24,077 --> 01:42:27,160
The courage to stand up to her fears.

1677
01:42:29,153 --> 01:42:30,236
To be strong.

1678
01:42:34,536 --> 01:42:37,869
My last words to her were, we're family.

1679
01:42:44,895 --> 01:42:45,895
And I...

1680
01:42:47,336 --> 01:42:48,526
I ignored her when she called me

1681
01:42:48,527 --> 01:42:51,360
'cause I wasn't the one important.

1682
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:04,473
I feel like I'm being punished
for even thinking that.

1683
01:43:06,335 --> 01:43:10,335
I need to know that she
knows she was important.

1684
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:14,852
You all recognized she was important.

1685
01:43:16,128 --> 01:43:18,128
Faith, you are an angel.

1686
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,913
You're protecting us right now.

1687
01:43:23,726 --> 01:43:25,665
On you on, Faith.

1688
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:27,333
On you on.

1689
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:36,436
When did you get to be so great at this?

1690
01:43:36,437 --> 01:43:38,895
Since I had a strong woman.

1691
01:43:38,896 --> 01:43:40,254

1692
01:43:40,255 --> 01:43:41,755
