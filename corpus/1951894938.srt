1
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,660
- Thanks for taking us to the movies.
- You're welcome, Donna.

2
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,940
See you at school tomorrow.

3
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,660
I'll wait for you at cheerleading tryouts.

4
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,820
Yeah, I think I'm gonna skip it this year.

5
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,340
Why?

6
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,780
Well, my mom doesn't think
it's such a good idea, you know,

7
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,380
- with all that's happened.
- She's probably right.

8
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,740
There's only one spot left on the team,
and one of us has to get it

9
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,580
so that Crissy doesn't.

10
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,780
What did that poor girl do to you two
to make you hate her so?

11
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,100
Where do you want me to start?

12
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,020
See you tomorrow. Bye.

13
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,100
Bye.

14
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,500
<i>They had an 8 and 2 record in 1941,
when they won the Rose Bowl at Duke.</i>

15
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,860
I'm home.

16
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,900
Dad?

17
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,980
Joey?

18
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,140
I almost killed myself on this!

19
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,820
Joey?

20
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,340
Did you hear me, butthole?

21
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,180
Hey!

22
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,660
Turn the TV down.

23
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,380
Where is she?

24
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,020
Where is she?

25
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,580
She's not here!

26
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,980
I swear to God!

27
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,020
Oh, help me, somebody!

28
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,420
Please, don't.

29
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,580
She belongs to me.

30
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,340
Where is she?

31
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,620
- I know you know, you're her mother.
- No!

32
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,420
Tell me where she is!

33
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,580
She's at a sleepover.

34
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,060
Please, don't.

35
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,380
Help me! Help me! Please, stop! Stop!

36
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,380
Help me!

37
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,060
I did it for us.

38
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,780
No!

39
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,580
And then what happens?

40
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,220
And then I wake up, just like I always did.

41
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,300
Well, like I told you before,

42
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,020
the nightmare is an associate form
of reliving the real experience.

43
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,620
It's to be expected.

44
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,820
I know.

45
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,700
I just...
They went away for such a long time.

46
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,020
I can't believe they're back.

47
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,580
Donna, it's going to take
more than three years.

48
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,820
You're doing amazingly well.

49
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,260
Think of him only as a phantom to you now.

50
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,020
He was caught and put away forever

51
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
2,300 miles away.

52
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,900
The only place that he can hurt you
is in your dreams.

53
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,940
I just thought they stopped.

54
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,380
Psychological trauma often heightens
during times of transition.

55
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,740
And you don't need me to tell you
that your life is in transition.

56
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,940
High school is coming to an end,
college in the fall.

57
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,940
The uncertainty
that comes with being an adult.

58
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,860
The memories of that night
will come and go and fade with time,

59
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,060
but you will never forget it.

60
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,900
Just like you'll never forget tomorrow night.

61
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,180
But hopefully that will be a memory
that you'll always want to remember.

62
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,980
So, tell me,

63
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,580
what color is your dress?

64
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,020
It's a champagne color
with pink and gold beads and it's corseted,

65
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
so it's a little sexy.

66
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh, it sounds pretty.

67
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,020
If you want to talk about sexy,

68
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,500
you should see Lisa's dress
with that plunging neckline.

69
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,340
Ronnie's gonna love you in it.

70
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,220
Yeah, he's gonna love me
even more out of it.

71
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,020
I made sure Ronnie got
the biggest limousine he could find.

72
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,940
I can't actually believe
that Michael is helping spring for the limo

73
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,940
and a two bedroom suite
with Ronnie and Bobby.

74
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,020
It's prom night.
That boy's planning on getting laid.

75
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,860
Yeah. In his dreams maybe.

76
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,380
All right, Donna. Have a look.

77
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,340
Oh, it looks good. I like it.

78
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,860
- Donna?
- What?

79
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,140
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

80
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,620
What time did Bobby say
to be ready for the limo?

81
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,780
- 7:00.
- Oh, I'm so excited.

82
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,060
- He's going to be here soon, Donna!
- Okay, Aunt Karen!

83
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,060
She's come so far.

84
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,540
Going to her senior prom.

85
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

86
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,020
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.

87
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,820
Sorry.

88
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,660
No, no, it's okay.

89
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,220
Have you stopped taking your pills?

90
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,380
Yeah, for like a week now.

91
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,300
You know what Dr. Crowe said.

92
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,900
I know, I just...

93
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,380
I don't want to be numb tonight.

94
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,580
I wanna remember everything.
Everything that happens.

95
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,260
Besides, you know, it's my prom.
I'm supposed to be really anxious, right?

96
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,940
Of course you are.

97
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,780
Gosh, you look so beautiful.

98
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,820
Thanks.

99
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,620
You are gonna have so much fun.
This is gonna be a great night.

100
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,820
Oh, my God! He's here.

101
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,660
Don't worry.

102
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,980
Here.

103
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,460
I know she would want you
to wear it tonight.

104
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,820
No, no. What if I get something on it?

105
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,380
She would be so proud of you.

106
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,500
Come here.

107
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,780
Thank you.

108
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,020
I'm gonna go downstairs
and tell Bobby that you're almost ready.

109
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,140
Okay.

110
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,220
Thanks.

111
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,540
I wouldn't be getting
a scholarship or anything, not my first year.

112
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,420
But I think if I work really, really hard...

113
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,820
You look beautiful.

114
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,260
Thanks.

115
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,220
You look so good. You clean up very well.

116
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,820
Thank you.

117
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,660
It's so pretty.

118
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,060
Yeah. Four hours with the flower lady.

119
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,700
- Did you pick it out yourself?
- Kind of.

120
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,260
Did not!

121
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,060
Okay, yeah. Thank you.

122
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,660
- Thank you.
- Here, I can do this.

123
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,660
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- Oh, my God!

124
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,500
You totally scared me.

125
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,900
- Perfect.
- Photo op.

126
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,180
Okay, ready?

127
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,940
- So cheesy.
- Okay. One, two, three, four, five.

128
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
There we go.

129
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,100
We're trusting you.

130
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,620
- I went to prom once...
- Honey, honey. It's okay.

131
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,740
I know, sir.
You have nothing to worry about.

132
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,860
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.

133
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,180
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.
- Come here.

134
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,060
- I love you guys.
- Have a great time, all right?

135
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,980
- Thank you.
- Good night.

136
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,580
I cannot wait to get there.

137
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,420
You look awesome!

138
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,460
Let's get to the goddamn prom.

139
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,380
You guys look so pretty!

140
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,420
Well, not the guys,
the guys look very handsome.

141
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,660
Wait, now guys get in.

142
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,740
You know Crissy is going
all Hollywood with her theme this year

143
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,780
since she's the president
of the prom committee.

144
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,020
I heard that she spent $100,000 over budget
and her dad had to write a check.

145
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
- Stop it!
- He's totally pissed!

146
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,020
I wish that was my daddy.

147
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,260
Rich bitch, one word.

148
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,060
- Oh, hyphen.
- $100,000?

149
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,460
Come on, more pictures! Pictures!

150
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,460
Next?

151
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,580
Great. Perfect.

152
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,460
- Hey, Winn.
- Yeah, that's Detective Winn to you, kid.

153
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,460
This just came in for you.

154
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,940
What?

155
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,740
<i>- Biller here.
- This is Detective Winn from Bridgeport PD.</i>

156
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,620
I'm calling about a fax
concerning the escape of Richard Fenton.

157
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,380
What the hell is going on?

158
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,380
<i>We just received word from the hospital
of Fenton's escape on Wednesday evening.</i>

159
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,500
Why'd it take three goddamn days
to notify us?

160
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,420
<i>Sorry, sir. I needed to notify the court.</i>

161
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,740
- Damn it, I don't believe this.
- What is it?

162
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,180
This is a case I had three years ago.
Hey, Jones, get me a car?

163
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,460
Come on.

164
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,140
High school teacher, he got crazy obsessed
with a young female student.

165
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,740
They fired him. That didn't stop it.

166
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,540
Then the family got a restraining order
against him and he went psycho.

167
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,500
She got home from the movies,
he didn't know she was there.

168
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,380
She hid under the bed
and had to watch him kill her mother.

169
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,620
Oh, my God.

170
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,660
We arrested that son-of-a-bitch at his house.

171
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,700
<i>We found journals of this guy
having fantasies about this girl.</i>

172
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,500
<i>He had pictures of her everywhere.</i>

173
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,980
That was pretty hard for her, too,
she had to ID him.

174
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,620
<i>You got something to say, Mr. Fenton?</i>

175
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Nothing can keep us apart.

176
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,780
<i>- That's him.
- She needs me now more than ever.</i>

177
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,340
She has no family.

178
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,820
- I see what you're trying to do.
- All she has is me.

179
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,460
- Hey, listen to me.
- You know we love one another?

180
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,580
- Ask Donna.
- Can we go now, please?

181
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,580
Are we almost done here?

182
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,980
Donna makes me feel,
and when I touch her...

183
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,700
That's enough!
Don't look over there, look at me!

184
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,380
<i>- Can we go now, please?
- We'll be together forever.</i>

185
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,900
You're gonna be in jail!

186
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,540
We'll be together forever.
That's my promise.

187
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
That's enough. We're going.

188
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,100
All right, you're going to jail.

189
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,140
<i>I'll see you soon, Donna.</i>

190
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,660
<i>We matched DNA,
his prints were everywhere,</i>

191
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,980
<i>so her IDing him sealed the deal.</i>

192
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,420
As far as we were concerned,
he was going to die. Definitely.

193
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,740
The jury didn't think so.
No, they came back with insanity.

194
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,900
He's been in a maximum security prison
for the criminally insane

195
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,900
<i>up until three days ago.</i>

196
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,300
What happened to the girl?

197
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,140
Well, she's got an aunt and uncle
that live here. They took her in.

198
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,900
After the trial,
things settled down a little bit,

199
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,100
- until she started getting the letters.
- Letters?

200
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,740
Yeah, and some sick shit, too.
Hang tight, kid.

201
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm gonna go tell the aunt and uncle.
This is gonna rock their world.

202
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,940
- Oh, we're turning in! We're here!
- Are we here? Yeah!

203
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,940
Holy crap!

204
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,820
We're here!

205
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,140
Talk about Hollywood.

206
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,900
You look lovely.

207
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,340
Nice try, Mr. Nichols. Bad boy.

208
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,580
Oh, God!

209
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,580
May I help you, sir?

210
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,380
Donna Keppel, you look incredible.

211
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,140
And Claire, you, too.

212
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,780
And Lisa, wow!

213
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,420
That dress, it's so...

214
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,940
Inappropriate?

215
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,100
Crissy! Wow, your dress...

216
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,900
It's so simple.

217
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,220
It's so you.

218
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,500
Girls.

219
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,540
Gentlemen?

220
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,420
Crissy, come on, this is prom.

221
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,140
Okay, let's just all be nice,
and just forget about the past.

222
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,420
As fellow prom queen nominee,
I want to wish you luck tonight.

223
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,740
You're gonna need all you can get.

224
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,580
Oh, you think you got it all wrapped up,
do you?

225
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,780
Well, they're certainly not propped up
and on parade like yours are,

226
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,380
that's for sure.

227
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,500
- You know what, I'm so sick...
- Baby, baby, she's not even worth it.

228
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,900
Look, you're gonna be queen,
I'm gonna be your king, all right?

229
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,580
Look, I'm gonna go get the keys right quick.
I'll be back.

230
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

231
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,940
Lisa, you really do look beautiful.
I just know you're gonna win.

232
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,420
Well, thanks, Ms. Waters.

233
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
- Have fun.
- Bye.

234
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,460
I know who she voted for.

235
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,020
- She is so in love with you.
- Shut up.

236
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,700
<i>Bridgeport High, huh?</i>

237
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,700
<i>Come on, now. What's up, everybody,
and welcome to the prom of all proms!</i>

238
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,780
- Oh, my God! Look at this place!
- Hey, look at me on the big screen.

239
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,780
<i>Bridgeport High, make some noise!</i>

240
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,700
<i>Yeah!</i>

241
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,820
<i>My name is DJ Tyler.
I'm gonna be hosting the events tonight.</i>

242
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,220
<i>This has to be the greatest prom on Earth.</i>

243
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,380
<i>Brought to you also by Crissy Lynn.
I see you over there, girl. Yeah!</i>

244
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,060
<i>Congratulations, Bridgeport High,
to all 206 of you graduates.</i>

245
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,700
<i>It's time to get the party started!
Get out there and get your party pumping!</i>

246
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,980
<i>Now, it's time for a little Consequence.</i>

247
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,300
I mean, you gotta hand it to Crissy, though.
This is amazing!

248
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,660
Wait, does this mean
we can't make fun of her anymore?

249
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,020
Nah!

250
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,780
And just so you know,
our fitness center will be closed

251
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,820
because of the renovations being done
on the mezzanine level.

252
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,020
Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.
If I can just get your autograph.

253
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,860
Can I get three keys to suite 312?
I have it reserved under Ronnie Heflin.

254
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,380
One moment.

255
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,660
All right. There you are, Mr. Heflin.

256
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,980
Thank you.

257
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,140
Do you have a preference
as to which floor, Mr. Ramsey?

258
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,260
Third floor would be great.

259
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,900
You really outdid yourself, Crissy.
I mean, we really appreciate it.

260
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,100
Thanks. I wanted it to look
just like an L.A. club.

261
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,820
I mean, nobody can believe it, right?

262
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,060
- One for you.
- Thank you.

263
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,500
One for you.

264
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,660
- And one for...
- We're going up to the room to freshen up.

265
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,220
Why, baby? You look great.

266
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,980
That's correct!
You're doing very well tonight.

267
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,820
But I'll look even better when I get back.

268
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,860
Well, let's go get a table,
before they're all gone.

269
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,220
Oh, hold that door.

270
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,060
Thank you.

271
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,940
Oh, man.

272
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,700
So...

273
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,180
Which one of you beautiful young women
is my date tonight?

274
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,620
So, we're gonna take this party upstairs,
ladies. Room 604.

275
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,300
Yeah, we'll... Be right up.

276
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,780
Lisa!

277
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,140
- 604.
- Right. Got it.

278
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,380
Come on.

279
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,180
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
- Sixth floor.

280
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,300
Excuse me. What's his problem?

281
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,420
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,860
The one on the end looked like my dad.
I swear.

283
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,380
Kind of, yeah!

284
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,420
That one guy was kind of cute.

285
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,180
- No!
- No!

286
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,060
Oh, my God!

287
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,860
Oh, my God, you guys!

288
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,140
Come here, come here, come here!

289
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,300
Excuse me?

290
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,300
My card, it doesn't seem to work.
Can you help?

291
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,780
Here's your problem, it's got a scratch.

292
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,460
Call the front desk, and someone
will bring you a replacement card.

293
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,180
Thank you very much.

294
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,260
One more thing.

295
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,980
Can I have some extra towels?

296
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,140
Sure.

297
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,580
Jack?

298
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,820
Detective Winn.

299
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,260
- Is she here?
- No, no, she's not.

300
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,700
- She's at her senior prom, why?
- Jack, I gotta talk to you.

301
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,140
Come outside.

302
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,740
What's going on?

303
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,740
Jack, it's Richard Fenton.
He escaped from jail three days ago.

304
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,900
He's at large.

305
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,860
How could it take so long
for us to be notified?

306
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,340
Jack, I think we should bring Donna home,
just to be safe.

307
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,780
I can't take a chance. I gotta put
a unit on your house, you know that.

308
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,140
All right?
And I'm gonna put backup on the hotel.

309
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,740
No.

310
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,300
Thank you.

311
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,660
For what?

312
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,380
For tonight.

313
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,020
For everything.

314
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,180
Well, you're welcome.

315
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,740
I am pretty awesome.

316
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,260
- At prom, you're gonna talk about this?
- I don't understand...

317
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,180
Hey, what's going on
with Claire and Michael?

318
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,780
Oh, same ol', same ol'.

319
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,340
He's freaking out because
she's going away to college. You know.

320
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,380
Babe, they'll be fine.

321
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,700
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

322
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,860
- What's going on?
- Michael. He's making me so damn mad.

323
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,620
And on top of that, I have killer cramps.

324
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,860
Don't let a stupid argument
ruin your prom night, okay?

325
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,580
And I have Midol up in my purse.
I'll go get it for you.

326
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,940
Thank you.

327
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,740
Is everything okay?

328
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,460
Yeah, I need the key to the suite.
I gotta go get something for Claire.

329
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,460
- I'll just go with you.
- Oh, no, no. It's okay.

330
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,860
Thank you.

331
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,580
Patrol car just pulled up.

332
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,060
I don't understand how you could not bring
her home with that maniac on the loose.

333
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,020
And Detective Winn, he said he wanted
to bring her home, you said that...

334
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,740
I know, I know, I know.

335
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,020
But he also said that there's no reason
to believe that Fenton's headed this way.

336
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,060
And, honey, if we show up at her prom,
in front of all her friends,

337
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,260
what's that gonna do to all the progress
that she's made over the past three years?

338
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,540
Do you remember how many nights
she woke up screaming?

339
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,860
I just don't ever want that little girl
to go through that again, do you?

340
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,740
No, of course I don't.

341
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,300
- But I'm so scared.
- I know, I know.

342
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,820
Hello?

343
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,620
Is anybody here?

344
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,620
Claire?

345
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,420
Bobby?

346
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,900
Is that you?

347
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,060
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

348
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,500
You scared the hell out of me!

349
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,140
Are you okay?

350
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,340
No.

351
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,500
What happened?

352
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,460
Michael thinks I'm going away to school
just so I can date other guys.

353
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,860
He just went ballistic because
he saw me talking to Rick. He's impossible.

354
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,740
I'm sorry.
Here, take these, it'll make you feel better.

355
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,260
Thanks.

356
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,780
Do you want me to hang out with you,
until you want to go back downstairs?

357
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,700
No. I'm just gonna fix my face,
then I'll come back down. Thanks.

358
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,580
How are you doing?

359
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm good.

360
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,180
- You look beautiful.
- You look beautiful.

361
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,860
Okay, I'll go request some J.T.,
we'll dance, we'll have fun.

362
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,580
See you down there.

363
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,420
Donna?

364
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,140
Michael?

365
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,500
Michael? What are you doing?

366
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,980
Mr. Fenton?

367
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,300
- Nash.
- I'm at Pacific Grand.

368
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,700
Our girl's got the senior prom tonight.

369
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,860
I want you to get Hicks, Stryker, Ansen,
and Grant, get them in plain clothes,

370
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,140
<i>get them over here ASAP.</i>

371
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,860
Why, is something wrong?

372
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,980
<i>No, and that's exactly how I want to keep it.</i>

373
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,020
By some chance this bastard decides
to come here, we're gonna be ready for him.

374
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,460
You got it.

375
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,900
Hey. Detective Winn, Bridgeport PD.
How are you?

376
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,620
Doing fine, thanks.

377
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,300
Have you seen this man tonight?

378
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,860
No. Who is this guy, anyway?

379
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,460
Oh, he's just someone I'm looking for.

380
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,980
He dangerous?

381
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,460
Do me a favor, why don't you make
copies of that, give it to your staff.

382
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,260
- Let me know if anyone sees him.
- Will do.

383
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,180
You got exits here.
How many exits you got?

384
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,140
- Two outside fire stairwells.
- Let me see that. Yep.

385
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,460
There's the loading dock in the back.

386
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Stairwell from the basement.

387
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,060
Three fire exits lit up on the ground floor,
in the main entrance.

388
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,540
- Can I keep this?
- It's all yours.

389
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,900
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

390
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,940
Should I be concerned?

391
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,060
No.

392
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,180
<i>All right, folks.
You looking real good out there tonight.</i>

393
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,660
<i>But what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna slow it down just a little bit,</i>

394
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,780
<i>because I don't want you
to sweat out your good clothes.</i>

395
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,500
<i>On your way to the dance floor, though,
fellas, grab your girl</i>

396
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>and thank your man Ronnie out there.</i>

397
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,780
<i>Ronnie Heflin is sending this song
out to his girl, Lisa Hines.</i>

398
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,260
<i>So, we gonna get that busy right now.
Here you go, folks.</i>

399
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,380
You wanna dance?

400
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,140
What's going on?

401
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,220
I'm thinking about going to State
with you next year.

402
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,460
Why?

403
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,180
I don't know.

404
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,140
I guess I just don't think I'm ready
to be so far away from home.

405
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,940
If we were at State together,
then we'd get to see each other all the time.

406
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,140
I mean, if you wanted to.

407
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,220
No, I would love that.

408
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,020
I mean, I would. I mean, you know I would.
It would be amazing.

409
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,260
But?

410
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,460
But nothing, Donna.

411
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,540
You got into Brown with a full scholarship.

412
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,420
I mean, you don't just throw that away
for anything, or anybody.

413
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,700
It's not that I don't want
to be near you next year.

414
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,700
It's just that...

415
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,620
That would be really selfish of me.

416
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,980
And I'd always know in the back of my head
that I was the reason

417
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,180
that you didn't get a big-time
Ivy League shot at the world, you know?

418
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,580
But what if this long distance thing
doesn't work out?

419
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,180
I mean, look what's happening
with Michael and Claire.

420
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,820
And Claire's gonna be only a two hour drive
away from him next year.

421
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,340
Claire and Michael are not you and me.

422
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,140
Not even close.

423
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,060
Right?

424
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,820
What is it?

425
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,300
I'm scared.

426
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,500
It just feels like

427
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,980
everything's falling apart.

428
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,900
And I'm scared of losing you.

429
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,180
I'm scared that somebody else
is gonna come along

430
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,660
and find out how amazing you are.

431
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,820
If this is real, it'll last.

432
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,780
I think we've been through some
pretty rough times already, don't you think?

433
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,300
- Yeah.
- Donna, you gotta stop being scared, okay?

434
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,860
Because there's nothing left to be scared of.

435
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,540
I promise.

436
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,900
Hey, you guys seen Claire lately?

437
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,020
Yeah. She's up in the suite.

438
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,620
What the hell is she doing up there?

439
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,020
You pissed her off, Michael.
She's been crying her eyes out.

440
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,460
You can't keep doing this to her.
You're gonna lose her.

441
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,300
Yeah, I doubt that.

442
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,020
Claire and Michael, exhibit A.
Nothing like us.

443
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,180
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

444
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,620
Claire?

445
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,300
Claire?

446
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,700
Are you here?

447
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,460
Are you in there?

448
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,420
Come on, babe.
Look, I don't want to fight anymore, okay?

449
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:56,260
Honestly, I promise. I'm gonna stop
bugging you about going away and all.

450
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,180
I'm just gonna deal with it, okay?
I swear to God.

451
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,620
Claire, please, don't do this.

452
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,540
All right. Fine.

453
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,060
I'm just gonna sit out here.
I'm just gonna wait for you to come out.

454
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,900
I don't care how long it takes.
I got all damn night.

455
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,820
All right.

456
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,300
Claire,

457
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,540
what do you want me to say?

458
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,380
You want me to say that I'm sorry?

459
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,780
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

460
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,020
Claire, look, I really am sorry, Claire.

461
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,500
Look, don't let my being an idiot
ruin our prom, okay?

462
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,220
Okay? Claire?

463
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,780
All right, where'd you go?

464
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,980
Claire?

465
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,540
Gotcha!

466
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,180
But I already said I was sorry.
What else do you want me to say, huh?

467
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,620
This is getting silly. Enough already.

468
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,980
Claire?

469
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,860
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

470
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,260
<i>I did not know you partied like that
here at Bridgeport!</i>

471
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,740
<i>Man, you done wore me out up here!</i>

472
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,940
<i>I tell you what though, I'm gonna take me
a little 15-minute break.</i>

473
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,220
<i>But while I'm gone,</i>

474
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,780
<i>the AV department put together
a nice little yearbook for you, so enjoy that.</i>

475
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,180
<i>And when I come back, this year's
prom king and prom queen, all right?</i>

476
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,900
<i>See you in a minute.</i>

477
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,140
Hey, let's go upstairs.

478
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,700
They're gonna announce king and queen.

479
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,540
DJ's taking a break, and then he's gonna
come back and play a couple other songs.

480
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,860
You don't care about this at all, do you?

481
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,660
What's to care about?

482
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,620
What if Ronnie wins king instead of you?

483
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,860
What if he does?

484
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,700
He's her boyfriend.
I have to be crowned with her boyfriend?

485
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,140
Look, Ronnie's the starting quarterback.
All-city two years in a row.

486
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,780
Yeah, Crissy, you could do a lot worse.

487
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,660
Besides, maybe you won't even win.

488
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,260
All right, look, I'm gonna go upstairs,
just call me when it's time, okay?

489
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,300
If he were any dumber I'd have to water him.

490
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,700
I wanna make a toast

491
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,940
to my little queen.

492
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,620
No matter what happens.

493
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,780
Cheers.

494
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,660
If that bitch wins, I swear

495
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,820
I'll hurl.

496
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,300
Okay, I'm sorry, but just explain to me
why do you care so much?

497
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,420
Because what do you get?

498
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,260
You get like a bouquet of roses and
a tacky tiara you can only wear at proms.

499
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,260
It's not about what you get.
It's, like, about the honor, you know?

500
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,980
It's about the respect of my peers.

501
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,820
- What?
- Your peers?

502
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,500
- That's the geekiest thing you've ever said.
- Okay, I guess it was a little geeky.

503
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,740
But seriously, I just want Crissy to know
that she can't buy everything.

504
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,300
And think about the reunions to come.

505
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,260
If I win, it'll eat away at her
till the day she dies.

506
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,900
That's awful.

507
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,900
You're so sexy
when you're mean and vindictive.

508
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,980
All right.

509
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,540
How's it going?

510
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,380
Yeah, well, so far so good.
Anything your end?

511
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,420
No.

512
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,620
Which one is she?

513
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,220
She's the blonde, at the back table.

514
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
She's pretty.

515
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,780
And alive. And I want her to stay that way.

516
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,100
Guys.

517
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,620
This is it.

518
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,860
This is all ending, this time of our lives.

519
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,420
You know, everyone always says that
prom is supposed to be this amazing time

520
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,540
that everyone looks forward to
since the beginning of freshman year.

521
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,740
But no one ever tells you

522
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,260
it's really sad, you know?

523
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,500
Because some of us are never
gonna see each other again.

524
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,740
- Except for us!
- Oh, thank you.

525
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,260
We'll see each other all the time.

526
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,180
Well, I don't know about any of them, but...

527
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,500
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

528
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,060
Ronnie, I'm gonna be 100 miles away.
I'm not going too far.

529
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,500
And I'll be home on the holidays.

530
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,300
And Claire's only gonna be two hours away.

531
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,860
- Where is Claire?
- Oh, yeah.

532
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,100
- Where's Michael?
- Maybe they're still in the suite.

533
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,420
Where we should be.

534
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,060
All right, stop.

535
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,460
You know what,
we're gonna give you guys some space.

536
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,500
- Yeah, we'll be right back.
- I think that's a good idea.

537
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,300
Come on, Maria. Where are you? Maria?

538
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,300
<i>Are you there?</i>

539
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,420
<i>Hello?</i>

540
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,740
Hey, Simms, come here.

541
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,660
Have you seen Maria?
412 needs a turn down

542
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,540
and I'm trying to get her on her walkie,
but she doesn't answer.

543
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,420
I've got this for 304.
I'll check and see if she's there.

544
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,140
All right, thanks.

545
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,940
- Great, thanks.
- Thank you.

546
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,140
Evening, sir.

547
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,260
Maria?

548
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,940
Excuse me, sir?

549
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,820
Yes.

550
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,780
Did you happen to see
the housekeeper up here?

551
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,620
She's right here in my room.

552
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,460
Turning down the bed.

553
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,140
Thank you.

554
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,980
Maria?

555
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,460
Hey, yo, Bobby, let me talk to you for a sec.

556
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,140
Me and Lisa are gonna head up to the suite,

557
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
see what's taking
Michael and Claire so long. All right?

558
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,860
Right. Just make it quick, all right?

559
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,460
Five minutes, max.

560
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,020
Is that all?

561
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,500
Very funny.

562
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
If you do see Michael and Claire,
tell them to get their butts down here.

563
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,420
Will do. Bye.

564
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,460
Where are they going?

565
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,540
Upstairs to the suite for a little alone time.

566
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,740
I'm not sleeping in that bed.

567
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,140
- I'm having a great time.
- Me, too.

568
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,860
I'm sorry.

569
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,460
Gotcha.

570
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,660
Look, come on, baby.

571
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,500
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

572
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,780
That guy, he looks so familiar.

573
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,180
His eyes.

574
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,260
Baby, your eyes are so...

575
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,260
- Where is it?
- The very back of the hotel's parking lot.

576
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,900
Come on, we ain't got a lot of time.

577
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,780
I swear that I know
that guy from somewhere.

578
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,820
Look, know him or want to get to know him?

579
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,420
Don't be stupid.

580
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,100
Did you see how he looked at me?
I mean, his eyes were so...

581
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,900
God, I swear I've seen him
some place before.

582
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,500
Why don't you stop
thinking about him, right?

583
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,460
Think about me, okay?

584
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,220
<i>There you go, Bridgeport.
That's how you do a prom, everybody.</i>

585
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,820
<i>You need to come to the parking lot.
I think we got something.</i>

586
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,660
<i>All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to move on out the way.</i>

587
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,620
<i>Clear the dance floor, because
this is the end of my time right now.</i>

588
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,620
<i>It's time for me to bring to the stage,</i>

589
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,060
<i>the prettiest P.E. teacher
I've ever met in my whole life.</i>

590
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,420
<i>Ms. Waters, everybody,
because she's about to announce</i>

591
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,260
<i>this year's prom king and prom queen.
Here we go!</i>

592
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,580
<i>Okay. Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

593
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,060
<i>Let's give it up for DJ Tyler
for giving us an awesome prom.</i>

594
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,820
<i>All righty.
Now, I have in my hot little hand here</i>

595
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,860
<i>Bridgeport High School's
prom king and prom queen.</i>

596
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,340
<i>Will the nominees please
join me here up on stage?</i>

597
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:44,540
<i>For prom queen I have,
Crissy Lynn, Lisa Hines...</i>

598
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,180
- They gotta get down here.
- I know, I know.

599
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,220
<i>... Michelle Evaretti, and Katie Higgins.</i>

600
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,860
<i>Come on up, girls!</i>

601
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,460
<i>- What's goin' on? You've reached Ronnie.
- Straight to voicemail.</i>

602
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,540
Try him on the house phone.

603
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,380
<i>All righty, and prom king is Rick Leland,</i>

604
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,940
<i>Ronnie Heflin, Michael Kelley,
and Dennis Long.</i>

605
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,260
A woman over in Woodburn
filed a missing persons on her husband.

606
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,940
She said that he would take the train
to work every day in Portland,

607
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,260
but he would always
leave his car at the station.

608
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,100
But he didn't come home last night.

609
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,140
Open it up.

610
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,060
No wallet, no ID, no credit card, no money.

611
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,220
And the car was registered to
a Howard K. Ramsey, our missing person.

612
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,140
<i>What about these decorations, everybody?
The prom committee, sensational job.</i>

613
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,780
You're so beautiful.

614
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,060
Jesus Christ!

615
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,540
- Of course! It's him, it's him!
- Look, enough already.

616
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,500
No, I gotta get to Donna!

617
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,540
I don't believe this.

618
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,580
Come on!

619
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,940
Damn it!

620
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,060
- Why the rush?
- Oh, God!

621
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,420
It must be off the hook.
They're not answering the room either.

622
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,020
Well, you better go up and try to find them.
I'm sorry. Be fast!

623
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,420
Oh, my God!

624
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,740
Lisa?

625
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,580
Lisa?

626
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,780
<i>- Ronnie Heflin, Lisa Hines.
- Oh, here's Ronnie! Here's Ronnie.</i>

627
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,140
Hey, where's Lisa?

628
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,980
I don't know. She said she came down
here to tell you that...

629
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,540
Oh, maybe she's in the bathroom.
Okay, you get up on stage. Go, go.

630
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,260
<i>- Ronnie, please.
- Sorry. I'm right here.</i>

631
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,420
Give me the key to the suite.
I'm gonna go try to find her in the bathroom.

632
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,780
If she's not there, I'll go check upstairs.

633
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,780
Where the hell is she?

634
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,300
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

635
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,220
<i>Has anyone seen Lisa Hines?</i>

636
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,980
Excuse me, sir. Howard K. Ramsey,
is he registered here? Ramsey.

637
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,860
Yes, sir. Room 309.

638
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,140
Okay, here's what we're doing.
You stay here by the front door.

639
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,620
You tell the guys at the exits
what's happening,

640
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,900
- and get me some backup, okay?
- You got it.

641
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,900
Give me a room key to room 309.

642
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,020
Mr. Ramsey.

643
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,740
Ah, damn it.

644
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,060
No. No, he's here. He's killed a maid.

645
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,020
<i>Cover all the doors.
I'm gonna pull the alarm.</i>

646
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,420
I want the entire place cleared immediately!
We'll flush him out.

647
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,980
Find Donna Keppel and put her
in protective custody now! Nash, now!

648
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,020
All right. You got it. Stryker, watch the door.

649
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,580
<i>All right, we're gonna
have to start without her.</i>

650
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,660
<i>Bridgeport High's
prom king and prom queen are...</i>

651
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,060
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

652
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,140
<i>- Please stay calm. Quiet, please.
- Everyone, please, quiet down!</i>

653
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,340
I'm Detective Nash
with the Bridgeport Police Department.

654
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,300
I am going to need you
to exit the hotel through the lobby.

655
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,220
Now, there's no reason to panic.
The Fire Department will be here shortly.

656
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,660
They were just about to
crown king and queen!

657
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,700
People! I'm not kidding, here!
Please, let's move, now!

658
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,180
This will have to wait, all right?

659
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,020
- The hell it will!
- Crissy!

660
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,260
Shit!

661
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,940
Oh, my God! You have to be kidding me!

662
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,180
Lisa?

663
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:28,820
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

664
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,540
Keep it moving, people.

665
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,580
Crissy, what's going on?
Where's everyone going?

666
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,780
- Hey, Rick? What's going on?
- I don't know, but we gotta go outside.

667
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,340
I forgot my mom's shawl upstairs.

668
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,340
If you see Bobby can you tell him
I'll meet him outside?

669
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,420
Thanks.

670
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,700
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

671
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,380
<i>If there is a Donna Keppel here,</i>

672
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,580
<i>will you please come
to the front of the stage?</i>

673
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,700
Excuse me. Why are you looking for Donna?

674
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,100
Why? Do you know where she is?

675
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,900
- She went looking for my girl.
- Where?

676
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,540
Women's restroom
and then up to the third floor.

677
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,540
Why?

678
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,220
Hey, what's the problem?

679
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,340
<i>Your attention, please.
Keep this area clear for emergency vehicles.</i>

680
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,540
<i>Stay on the sidewalk.</i>

681
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,620
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.
This is an emergency.</i>

682
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,620
Lisa?

683
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,620
Claire?

684
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,300
Hello?

685
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,220
Oh, I've missed you.

686
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,380
There isn't a moment where
I haven't thought about you, Donna.

687
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,300
Please, don't do this.

688
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,260
Don't be afraid.

689
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,900
Donna!

690
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,300
Get out!

691
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,500
No!

692
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,180
No!

693
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,940
Donna, open up.

694
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,460
Open up!

695
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,100
Donna!

696
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,700
No!

697
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:38,900
No!

698
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,980
Leave me alone!

699
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,660
Ansen, Grant, I need these people back!
Push them 50 yards back!

700
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,740
Get them back here, put it right there.
Come on! Let's go!

701
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,660
You gotta be all the way back
to the sidewalk, all right?

702
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,460
- Winn.
- Where is she?

703
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,940
I don't know. They got separated.

704
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,340
- He said she went to go look for her friend.
- What the hell is going on?

705
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,980
Why won't anybody
tell me why you're looking for Donna?

706
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,980
Hey, man. She went back up
to your suite to get something.

707
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:14,740
Move, move, move!

708
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,220
She told me to tell you just to wait here.
She'd come back down.

709
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,460
You couldn't tell me sooner, Rick?

710
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,100
Did you see Lisa?

711
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,620
No.

712
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,500
Donna?

713
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,780
Donna, stop!

714
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,140
He's in there, he's in there,
he's in there, he's in there!

715
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,060
Claire's under the bed and she's dead!
She's dead!

716
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,220
- Get her out of here, Nash.
- You have to help me, please.

717
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,340
Hey! Donna! Donna!

718
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:57,100
Bobby. Bobby. Oh, my God! Bobby!

719
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,380
- Yeah, come on. Here. You okay?
- Donna, get in the car. Please.

720
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,700
- I'm going with her.
- Okay, get in the car.

721
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,420
Can he come with me?

722
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,500
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
- I won't. I'm coming, I'm coming, baby.

723
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,580
- Look, what's happening?
- Hold on.

724
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,620
I talked to your aunt and uncle.
They know what's going on, okay?

725
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,740
- I'm gonna take you home, all right?
- Look, did you see Lisa?

726
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,060
Claire's dead.

727
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,180
What'd you say?

728
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,500
Bobby! Wait!

729
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,940
Wait!

730
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,460
Clear a lane here, please!

731
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,100
Yeah.

732
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,380
He's somewhere in this hotel,
because all the exit points are covered.

733
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,660
We're gonna tear this place apart,

734
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,740
room by room, floor by floor,
until we get him.

735
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,780
How's the girl doing?

736
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,140
Yeah, she's safe.
And her boyfriend's with us, too.

737
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,300
Keep that house completely covered
until I find this guy.

738
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,980
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

739
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,260
My girlfriend is missing, and I need to know
what the hell is going on!

740
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,740
I'm sure she's out here somewhere,
all right? Just take a look for her.

741
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,820
Okay, let's go!

742
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,900
We'll find her.

743
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:05,860
Here it is. We have three dead.
One maid, two kids, okay?

744
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,420
We've had all the exits covered all night,
so there's no way he got out.

745
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,700
I want to start on the ground floor,
and work our way up.

746
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:16,460
The hotel already knows what's going on,
so let's get to work. Come on, let's go!

747
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:20,260
Hey, Hicks, do me a favor,
get all those people to go home. Everybody.

748
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,900
Consider it done.

749
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,940
Hey, is everybody out?

750
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,820
- Yes, sir.
- I think so.

751
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,300
Lisa?

752
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,420
Donna!

753
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:46,100
Oh, my God! Oh, thank God you're safe!

754
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,380
- It's all happening again.
- It's okay.

755
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,620
- Bobby, you okay?
- Yes, sir, I am.

756
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,860
I called my parents
and I told them what was happening.

757
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,460
- I'd like to stay with Donna tonight.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

758
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,820
Come on inside.

759
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,260
Mr. Turner, please.

760
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,100
- I'm Detective Nash.
- Hey, how are you?

761
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,780
How many entrances are on the house?

762
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,820
There's the front and the back, what?

763
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,340
Tell me you've caught this animal.

764
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,740
- I can't find Lisa!
- We are looking for her.

765
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,620
I've got some missing students inside.
I want to know what you're doing about it.

766
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,100
We are doing the best we can.
Please, be patient.

767
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,780
<i>Copy that.
We're finishing fourth floor, north exposure.</i>

768
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:42,180
Someone said that Claire was murdered,
and Michael and Lisa are missing.

769
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,820
- We all clear?
- We're all clear.

770
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,940
Let's close it up.

771
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,980
Over here.

772
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,780
Jesus.

773
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,860
<i>... faculty, staff, and guests,
to evacuate onto the streets.</i>

774
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,580
<i>The news conference, I'm sure,
will be forthcoming, and we will be here live</i>

775
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,900
<i>to give you the updates as they come in.
But to recap,</i>

776
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,740
<i>a night that was supposed to be
one of the greatest nights in a student's life</i>

777
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:29,300
<i>may have ended tragically
in the historic Pacific Grand Hotel.</i>

778
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,780
What's going on, Detective?

779
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,860
This is an active crime scene investigation.

780
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,380
If we have any more information to share,
you will be the first to know.

781
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,860
Is it true that a student was murdered?

782
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,220
And that other students
at the prom are missing?

783
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,060
- Can you give us anything?
- Detective?

784
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:46,860
<i>The SWAT teams are engaged at the hotel.
Guests were evacuated and cleared.</i>

785
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,420
Look, we're just down the hall
if you need anything.

786
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,820
What are you doing?

787
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,140
Checking to see if there's
any news on what happened.

788
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:32,780
<i>Three students may have been
injured or killed in this historic hotel.</i>

789
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,420
They're dead.

790
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,260
They're dead, Bobby. They're dead.

791
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,380
- No, you still don't know that.
- Michael, Lisa and Claire, they're all dead.

792
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,940
He killed them.

793
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,180
They're dead because
he was trying to get to me.

794
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,900
No, Donna. This is not your fault, okay?

795
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,660
This is not you, okay? This is him.

796
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,300
This is him, and they're gonna catch him,
okay? I promise.

797
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,500
How?

798
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,020
How can you promise me that?

799
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,900
I'm sorry.

800
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,540
Okay. Okay, come on.

801
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,740
Listen to me, I'm gonna be here, okay?

802
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,220
I'm gonna be here watching over you, okay?

803
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:44,900
Sorry, two, sir, is right here. Girl.

804
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,260
We got a positive ID from Ronnie Heflin.

805
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,420
His girlfriend was the female victim
we found up on the construction level.

806
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,860
- How's the kid doing?
- Not so good.

807
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,980
That's it. We turned the place upside down,
no sign of him anywhere.

808
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:07,020
What do you wanna do about the press?
They're getting kind of antsy.

809
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,220
I don't know.

810
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,660
I don't know.

811
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,300
What is that?

812
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,700
What the hell is that?

813
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,580
Get me a ladder. Get me a ladder!

814
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,660
Let's move this bed.

815
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:51,380
Come on, come on, put it right here.
Who's got a flashlight?

816
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,620
Jesus!

817
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,620
- Oh, my God.
- It's Simms!

818
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,620
- Hey, is everybody out?
- I think so.

819
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,740
Damn it. He walked right by me.
Move, move!

820
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,260
- Hey, has anybody talked to Nash?
- 10 minutes ago. Everything was cool.

821
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,660
- Nash.
- Hey, Fenton's out. He's not at the hotel.

822
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,340
Copy that. We're on it.

823
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,060
<i>What's the status with the family?</i>

824
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,860
They all went upstairs
about an hour and a half ago.

825
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,860
There's a light on in Donna's bedroom.

826
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,020
All right. I'm gonna call
and let them know what's happening.

827
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,340
<i>- Copy?
- Yeah, you got it.</i>

828
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,100
<i>She's not supposed to be with somebody
else, she's supposed to be with me.</i>

829
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,580
<i>There was even the song on the radio.</i>

830
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,620
- Donna?
- Oh, my gosh!

831
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:19,740
You scared me.

832
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,660
- You okay?
- Yeah.

833
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,740
- I thought you were sleeping.
- No.

834
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,180
No, I was just resting my eyes.

835
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,500
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

836
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,860
<i>It's not like you hear the song Mandy
on the radio every day.</i>

837
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,900
<i>I haven't heard that song in like ten years.</i>

838
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:31,980
What?

839
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:41,420
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time. This is a recording.</i>

840
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,500
Were you sleeping?

841
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,060
No. I was just resting my eyes, okay?

842
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,460
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

843
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,060
<i>It's not like you hear the song Mandy
on the radio every day.</i>

844
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,420
<i>I haven't heard that song in like ten years.</i>

845
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,380
<i>The number you have reached is not

846
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,580
No, it can't be. It can't be.

847
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,980
I can't get through.
Something weird's going on with the phone.

848
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,580
Get in there and check it out!

849
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,940
<i>- Everything is secure, sir.
- Get in there and check it out right now!</i>

850
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,140
<i>I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

851
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,820
Nash!
I told you to get up in there and call me!

852
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,980
Nash?

853
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,060
Thank you for staying.

854
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,220
Bobby?

855
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,180
Hey. Hey.

856
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,220
Donna?

857
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:40,300
Be quiet, or they'll find us.

858
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,140
Oh, my God!

859
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,820
One of your guys is down in the backyard.

860
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,140
It's okay. It's okay.

861
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,060
Are you ready to go with me?

862
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:25,540
No!

863
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,500
Help!

864
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,620
Call me an ambulance.

865
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,900
I've got officers down,
I need backup, now, now!

866
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:43,980
Where is she?

867
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,940
- Let me go!
- Stop! Stop!

868
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,660
- Get off me!
- Donna!

869
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,380
No!

870
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:28,500
Bobby?

871
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

872
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:36,460
I'm sorry.

873
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,180
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay.

874
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,700
It's over.

875
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,007
It's over, it's over. Okay?
