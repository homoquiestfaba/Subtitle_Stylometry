1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,414
(crowd cheering)

2
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,765
(bell ringing)

3
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,206
Radio: We're just moments away
from the bell

4
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:40,841
to begin the fourth round
here at Madison Square Garden.

5
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,444
The first three rounds
belong to The Brown Bomber,

6
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,778
Joe Louis.

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,647
He punished the Spaniard,
Paolino Uzcudun

8
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,183
with every conceivable
combination of punches.

9
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,353
Referee: One...

10
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:05,359
Crowd: Two, three, four, five,

11
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,895
six, seven,

12
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:11,599
eight, nine, ten.

13
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,802
Out!

14
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,971
Thank god almighty
for Joe Louis!

15
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,540
And the brown bomber,
Joe Louis,

16
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,909
moves one step closer
to meeting Jimmy Braddock

17
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,844
for the heavyweight crown.

18
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,846
You sent him, Joe,
you sent him.

19
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,684
he all right?

20
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,953
He'll be fine.

21
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,922
Announcer: fans and reporters
at ringside stunned

22
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,024
at Louis 's
awesome display of...

23
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,025
I tell you, I seen it all.

24
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,594
I never seen nothing
like that before.

25
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,796
You get what
we came for?

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,735
Hiya, Maxie.

27
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,237
Jim Farley!

28
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,239
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Joe Jacobs,

29
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,773
my favorite
pain in the ass.

30
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,242
I'll take that
as a compliment.

31
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,943
Listen, you tell your
boxing commissioner

32
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,845
that Louis is ready
for a test.

33
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,847
He don't need
no more patsies.

34
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,982
That was Paolino's
first time on the canvas

35
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,584
in his entire career.

36
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,853
Didn't he fight your boy
to a draw last year?

37
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,255
Who remembers
that far back?

38
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,257
Listen, listen,
listen closely.

39
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:13,561
Maxie has the key to dropping
Louis locked between his ears.

40
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,364
Good, most fighters have got
plenty of room in there.

41
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,733
Listen, you sanction us
against him, you'll see.

42
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,635
We'll take it
under advisement.

43
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,437
Commodore hotel,
we'll be waiting.

44
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,605
Yeah, hiya, Maxie.

45
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,639
Mr. Farley.

46
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,408
So, what do you
think of Louis?

47
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,810
Well, he has
a locomotive right.

48
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,878
With all his talent,

49
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,546
he could be
the greatest one day.

50
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,014
But not this day,
eh, Max?

51
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,116
I'll see you, Max.

52
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,486
I don't think it's
impossible to beat Joe Louis.

53
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,888
Right, you got what,
nine long years on him?

54
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,556
You two are here scouting,
aren't you?

55
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,558
No, we just crossed the pond
to get some comfort food

56
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,993
at Katz's Deli.

57
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,762
Hitler know you're
feeding him Jewish food?

58
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,598
I see something.

59
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:54,034
What? What do you see, Max?

60
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,437
A way to undo Louis?

61
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,309
I see something.

62
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,833
(knocking on door)

63
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,935
it's open.

64
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,737
Breakfast in 15 minutes?

65
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,073
What the hell
are you doing

66
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,775
drinking at eight
in the morning?

67
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,977
Celebrating, and it ain't easy
being the life of the party

68
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,680
with no party around.

69
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,682
What are you celebrating?

70
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,955
You and Louis.

71
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,824
Winner to meet
Braddock for the title.

72
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,863
You did it.

73
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,698
I did.

74
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,369
Hey.

75
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,040
You know, my father always said
a good salesman doesn't push,

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,377
he pulls.

77
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,911
And boy, was he wrong.

78
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,774
Radio announcer:
beautiful Pompton Lakes
is no vacation getaway

79
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,576
for young Joe Louis.

80
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,778
The Brown Bomber is blasting
his way towards becoming

81
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,647
the first negro
heavyweight champion

82
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:50,751
since Jack Johnson
23 years ago.

83
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,152
The dark dynamiter's
sparring partners

84
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,021
are the highest paid
in the business,

85
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,824
and boy, do they
earn every penny of it.

86
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,959
"send in another one"
says Jack Blackburn,

87
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,028
Joe's trainer.

88
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,664
After every victory,

89
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,566
Joltin' Joe is
the toast of Harlem,

90
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,001
yet he's always welcome
at Jack Dempsey's

91
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,438
swank Manhattan restaurant.

92
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,440
Joe's brought along his
beautiful wife Marva,

93
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,075
the first lady
of colored America.

94
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,744
Well, there's Jack now,

95
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,747
giving him some pointers on
the upcoming Schemling fight.

96
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,516
Joe's the friendliest guy
you'd ever want to meet,

97
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,452
outside the ring,
of course.

98
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,960
Ah, Marva 's fried chicken,
Joe's favorite.

99
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,062
It takes a lot of ammo
to fuel those fists.

100
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:38,666
Boys, this is a
new day for boxing.

101
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,768
And Joe Louis is the dawn.

102
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,203
You really think that a
colored fighter has a shot?

103
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,072
This son of a sharecropper
spent his youth

104
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,275
hauling blocks of ice
up Detroit tenements

105
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,110
and laboring in
the ford plant,

106
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,145
all to feed his family.

107
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,483
Joe Louis will be as honest
and generous a champion

108
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,486
as America could dare hope for.

109
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,153
You'll have to
excuse my Uncle Mike.

110
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,623
He's biased.

111
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,559
How about a shot of Joe digging
into a piece of watermelon?

112
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,227
Yeah, how about it, Joe?

113
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,662
Yeah , come on!

114
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,998
Oh, I don't really
care much for watermelon.

115
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,700
You love watermelon.

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,001
Today I don't.

117
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,369
Reporter:
Ah, come on, why not?

118
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:20,373
What do we say we let the man
eat so he can get back to work?

119
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,010
Okay, gentlemen,
this way.

120
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,145
Let's tour the camp.

121
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,581
Next thing, you'll
have him tap dancing.

122
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,186
What was that all about?

123
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,289
Uncle Mike gets carried away,
but he sure is making us rich.

124
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,527
Well, I can't
argue with that.

125
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:43,263
I wish you could stay, baby,
but you know how Chappie is.

126
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes, I know
how Chappie is.

127
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,168
Well, where is Henry
with the car?

128
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,003
He's supposed
to be here.

129
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,805
I don't know.

130
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,575
I guess you'll be
needing a lift.

131
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,644
Why don't you take
that one over there?

132
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,083
For me?

133
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,152
It's all yours,
doll baby.

134
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,627
Oh! Look at this.

135
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,830
Oh, it's so beautiful.

136
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,566
Just like you baby.

137
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,574
Are you sure?

138
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,276
A classy woman should
be driving her own car.

139
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,980
You know what I love?

140
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,783
The looks I get
when we walk in a joint,

141
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,919
and all those people
turn in their seats.

142
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,255
"Who's that fine looking woman
with punchy over there?"

143
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,796
You are the sweetest
man, Joe Louis.

144
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,632
Thank you.

145
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,169
Look who's here.

146
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,804
I was about to
say the same.

147
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,872
How are you, David?

148
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,807
Fine, the entire
salon is here.

149
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,008
I'll be right back.

150
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,285
Hello, everyone!

151
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,220
Max.

152
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,856
I missed you, sweetheart.

153
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,036
Congratulations, Max,
you deserve this fight.

154
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,337
Max, how was your trip?

155
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,339
A little rough,
I still feel a little dizzy.

156
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,675
Don't knock it.

157
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,810
I pay good money
for that feeling.

158
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,181
Ladies and gentlemen...

159
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,321
It's wonderful.

160
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,324
Thank you, it's my only work
they'll never ban.

161
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,793
[ door closing ]

162
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:34,167
Herr Schemling,
your presence is requested.

163
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,368
By whom?

164
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,404
The Minister of Propaganda.

165
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,438
Right now?

166
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,474
Yes, Herr Goebbels
is waiting for you.

167
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,911
But he's only
just arrived home.

168
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:52,219
Retired captain David Levin,
third batallion, 92nd infantry.

169
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:58,191
Please, we leave at once.

170
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,794
Excuse my frankness, Madame,

171
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,931
but I must say that
I have seen all of your films.

172
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,734
You are as lovely in
person as in the movies.

173
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,904
Sorry I have to
rush out like this.

174
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,943
Where are we meeting next week?

175
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,277
Next week?

176
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,981
Paris.

177
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,021
Extraordinary,
don't you think?

178
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,924
Herr Goebbels.
Herr Schemling.

179
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:09,029
Titian displayed such clarity of
purpose with each brush stroke.

180
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,563
I've read of
your interest in art.

181
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,533
So, you are an avid reader?

182
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,268
Please.

183
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,971
Do you recall
the section of "Mein Kampf"

184
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,875
Where the Fuhrer
deals with boxing?

185
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,344
I'm afraid I don't.

186
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,081
He views the sport
as a battle not of body,

187
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,216
but of will.

188
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,418
A determined will
is essential.

189
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,554
That must explain your setting
a fight with a negro

190
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,423
without our permission.

191
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,661
I'll earn a title fight
by beating Joe Louis.

192
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,964
I admire your confidence,

193
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,866
but the negro is
a ten to one favorite

194
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,837
in the American newspapers.

195
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,439
I suggest you
take that wager.

196
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,144
I project myself
to the day you have fought,

197
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,848
and possibly been beaten by,
a negro.

198
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:06,253
The Fuhrer will be
disappointed on that day.

199
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,158
I will win,
for Germany.

200
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,328
To victory, then.

201
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,339
Remembering:
What do you see, Maxie?

202
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,275
A way to undo Louis?

203
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,276
I see something.

204
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,313
Louis drops his guard!

205
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,048
Counter!

206
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,416
Look out!

207
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,121
When he drops his left,
What do you do?

208
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,123
You counter.

209
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,457
Counter!

210
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:48,361
He drops his left!
Counter! Counter!

211
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,097
Yeah, that's it!

212
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:53,566
Hook, hook, hook!
Hook, hook, hook!

213
00:13:56,536 --> 00:14:00,407
okay, good, good.

214
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,476
That's enough for today.

215
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,081
Very good work.

216
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,917
See you tomorrow.

217
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,049
Woman: How much are you
going to miss me?

218
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,586
You have no idea.

219
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:55,295
Well, at least--

220
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,031
at least training
keeps you distracted.

221
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,335
Meanwhile, I'm forced
to suffer though love scenes

222
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:07,307
with handsome young actors
who never quite get it right.

223
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,111
We have to do endless takes.

224
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,748
Maybe you should
come with me to America, then.

225
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,986
I like that
idea much better.

226
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,988
I could learn to box.

227
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:27,427
I bet I could knock you out
if I put my mind to it.

228
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,999
What is it?

229
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,701
I'm just tired.

230
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,237
Max, what's wrong?

231
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,076
If I lose at my age,

232
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,512
I might never
get another chance.

233
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:55,455
On June 19, you are going
to surprise everyone,

234
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,224
except for me.

235
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,029
Radio announcer:
The Brown bomber looks
fit as a fiddle.

236
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,531
Joe Louis weighs
in exactly 198 pounds.

237
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,832
At six foot one
and three quarter inches

238
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,701
and with 14-inch biceps,
it's hard to imagine...

239
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,537
different radio announcer:
Louis, the magnificent animal.

240
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,672
He eats, he sleeps,
he fights.

241
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,641
Joltin' Joe is nine years
younger than Schemling

242
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,344
and possesses greater
reach and power.

243
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,512
Experts believe 31-year-old
Schemling's best years

244
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,680
are behind him.

245
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,651
Max Schemling weighs
in exactly 192 pounds.

246
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,654
Joe Louis retains the calm
and coolness of a gunslinger,

247
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,357
paralyzing his opponents
before the first round gong.

248
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:35,862
Hi, Joe.
How are you?

249
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:39,299
Blood pressure for Joe Louis
is 165 over 110,

250
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:45,072
slightly elevated.

251
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,475
Good luck to you tonight, Joe.

252
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,343
He sure is a cool bird.

253
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:54,081
Max Schemling's blood pressure
is 140 over 90, normal.

254
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:58,085
Looks like you got a fight
on your hands this time.

255
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:35,822
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
on hand for tonight's bout,

256
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:40,527
the current heavyweight
champion of the world,

257
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,197
Jimmy Braddock!

258
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:57,144
Fighting out of Germany,

259
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,981
weighing in at 192 pounds,

260
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:07,354
the European champion
Max Schemling!

261
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,663
His very capable opponent,

262
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,600
weighing in at 198 pounds,

263
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,438
one of the best
heavyweights in fistiana,

264
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,276
Joe Louis!

265
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:33,446
Radio announcer:
45,000 fans rise to cheer
Joe Louis as he's introduced

266
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,848
on what should be
his final tune-up

267
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,719
before he fights Jimmy Braddock
for the heavyweight crown.

268
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,389
This is it, Max.

269
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,657
Give him your
calling card right away.

270
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,627
Now feel him
out some first, huh?

271
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,662
See what he's bringing.

272
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,633
Here.

273
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,938
I'm going to mark this guy.

274
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,807
(bell rings)

275
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,045
Radio announcer:
The undefeated Louis is going
for his 24th straight knockout

276
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,848
and his 28th straight victory.

277
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,817
Louis and Schemling
look each other over,

278
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,553
very cautious
here in the early going.

279
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,922
Louis starts working that jab.

280
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,324
Schmeling takes it,

281
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,926
too old and too slow
to defend against it.

282
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,364
Louis, with a left to the body,
another left,

283
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,666
a right and back
with a left hook!

284
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,568
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!

285
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,242
Round two.

286
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,245
Louis picks up
where he left off.

287
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,880
Another jab, jab, jab,
and a right to the head!

288
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,250
Oh! Repeated lefts
and rights to the head!

289
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,884
Schmeling is little more
than a punching bag

290
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,753
for the young slugger.

291
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,488
I should've stayed in bed.

292
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,359
(bell ringing)

293
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,593
He can punch.

294
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,395
What? You can't?

295
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,896
Keep that jab up.

296
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,332
Keep working that
left eye, got it?

297
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,533
Stick and move,
stick and move,

298
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,768
keep moving, okay?

299
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:02,869
(bell ringing)

300
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,344
Radio announcer:
Louis is hurting Schemling
and this crowd is loving it!

301
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,017
Schemling missing
on a big right,

302
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,719
nearly falling down.

303
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,523
Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

304
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,892
Finally a brief flurry
from Schemling.

305
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,562
Louis comes right back,
staggering the German.

306
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,364
(bell ringing)

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,736
You're looking real good,
that jab is really working.

308
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,438
You're hitting him at will.

309
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,341
Just make sure that you
snap that hand back, got it?

310
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,410
Snap it back to
your chin, got it?

311
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,811
Why don't I just
knock him out?

312
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:45,978
God damn it,
listen to me!

313
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,447
Don't throw
that left again

314
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,382
if you really hurt him with
the right, you got it?

315
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,550
Yes, sir.

316
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,018
Let's go!

317
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,620
What are you
doing out there?

318
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,323
Five jabs in a row without
a single counter punch.

319
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,890
What are you waiting on,
Maxie? Come on!

320
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,560
Shut up, both of you!

321
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,829
(bell ringing)

322
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,732
Fourth round, Louis is
looking to close things out.

323
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,944
Louis jabs.

324
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,447
Max remembering:
when Louis drops
his guard, counter.

325
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,882
Counter.

326
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,451
What do you see, Max?

327
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,752
I see something.

328
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,054
When Louis drops his guard,
you counter!

329
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,089
Jab, jab, jab...

330
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:31,824
Get that hand up,
get that hand up!

331
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,762
Counter!

332
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,697
Radio announcer:
A big break stuns Louis!

333
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,592
Louis goes down!
Louis is down!

334
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:10,997
Take an eight count.

335
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,999
Joe Louis is on the canvas!

336
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,667
Holy smokes!

337
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,135
For the first time
in his career,

338
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:17,937
Louis has been decked.

339
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,072
Take an eight count!

340
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,008
The once invincible
brown bomber

341
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,411
has been knocked down!

342
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:27,714
(crowd chanting)
Maxie, Maxie, Maxie, Maxie!

343
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,922
Radio announcer:
the crowd is more than stunned!

344
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,426
They've begun cheering for
the German Schemling!

345
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,193
(bell ringing)

346
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,430
Chants of
"Maxie, Maxie, Maxie"

347
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,433
boom out through
the entire stadium!

348
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,171
What are they
doing that for?

349
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,740
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
fuck 'em!

350
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,974
Doesn't mean
a damn thing!

351
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,478
You shook him up, Max!

352
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,012
Now listen to me carefully.

353
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,948
Go hard at him from the bell!

354
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,884
Listen, you got to
knock his ass out, you got it?

355
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,054
Knock his ass out!

356
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,731
Let's go.

357
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:23,102
(bell ringing)

358
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,905
Referee:
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
back off, back off.

359
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,941
Get him, come on.

360
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,484
Radio announcer:
Schemling wants to end
this fight right here,

361
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,986
but here comes Joe Louis.

362
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,902
No one expected the fight
to go this long,

363
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:59,506
or the German warhorse
Schemling to prove so game.

364
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,677
round six was clearly
won by Schemling,

365
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,114
but round seven
belongs to Joe Louis.

366
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,953
Schemling has taken everything
Louis has in his arsenal,

367
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,122
and given it
right back to him.

368
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,528
Neither fighter
is backing down.

369
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:24,296
Neither fighter is able
to put the other down!

370
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,865
Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

371
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,050
(bell ringing)

372
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,023
He's kicking
your black boy's ass!

373
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,224
You bring it on!

374
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,226
Police are fanning out
in the stadium.

375
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,297
There's a lot of commotion
in the stands.

376
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,799
Louis looks tired.

377
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,868
Schmeling goes
on the offensive.

378
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,575
Come on, Joe!

379
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,012
The right combination drives
Louis back to the ropes.

380
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,115
Joe grabs on for dear life!

381
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,676
One, two...

382
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,945
Louis is down again
here in the 12th!

383
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,647
I don't know if
he'll get back up.

384
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,082
The crowd roars
for the German Schemling,

385
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:54,621
as Louis lies battered
and beaten on the canvas!

386
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,957
No!

387
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,793
He's not getting back up!

388
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,094
You're out!

389
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,163
Schmeling has won this fight!

390
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,287
Max, great fight,
you deserve it!

391
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,222
You deserve the shot!

392
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,325
(crowd chanting)
Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

393
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,202
Chappie?

394
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,678
What happened to me?

395
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,114
Ah, it's nothing tragic, son.

396
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,686
You just got knocked out.

397
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,158
Come on.

398
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,130
Radio announcer:
The once invincible
Joe Louis falls,

399
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,033
and the quake is heard
around the world.

400
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,704
(crowd yelling)

401
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,540
Up in Harlem,
an angry mob is rioting

402
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,009
over what many
residents there believe

403
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,712
must have been
a fixed fight.

404
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:29,081
Ringside experts now believe
Louis has a glass jaw,

405
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,084
and may even be a dumb fighter.

406
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,120
They're wondering
not just whether Louis

407
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,088
has the guts to come back,
but whether there will ever be

408
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,424
another colored
heavyweight champion.

409
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:40,459
Mr. Louis?

410
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,229
It'd mean a lot
for my boy to meet you.

411
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,065
Sure.

412
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,267
Introduce yourself, son.

413
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,803
Hi, I'm Joe.

414
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,473
Joe?

415
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:55,975
You got a fighter's name.

416
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,810
Yeah.

417
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,311
Is that what
you want to be, son?

418
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,980
Yes.

419
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,953
All right,
let's see what you got.

420
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:13,025
You best keep
that left up real high,

421
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,962
or you're going
to get walloped.

422
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,296
Take it from me.

423
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,500
Now you got it.

424
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,469
God bless you,
brother.

425
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,470
Here he is.

426
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,272
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

427
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:30,476
Joe, you heard about
the reaction in Harlem?

428
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,944
Reaction to what?

429
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,113
The biggest upset
in the history of boxing.

430
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,348
A devastated race of people
left in your wake.

431
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,784
I'm the one that
took the beating in there,

432
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,285
I don't see how
I hurt my people none.

433
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,888
There's word of
a Harlem girl who drank poison

434
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,055
when she heard
that you lost.

435
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,891
Yep, that's what
they're saying.

436
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:46,793
All right, that's it,
step aside.

437
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:53,232
Announcement:
Attention, all passengers
on the 8:15 bound for Detroit

438
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:56,803
should begin boarding now
on track 11.

439
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,510
Everybody's staring.

440
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,080
You're not a movie star,
you're a fighter.

441
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,086
Oh, baby.

442
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,325
Kid better
be all right.

443
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,427
I ain't going back
to running numbers.

444
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,264
Just flip your cards
and count your pennies.

445
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,299
I'll take care of him.

446
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,238
It ain't right the way
you and Uncle Mike talk to me.

447
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm the one
who discovered Joe.

448
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,243
You just riding my
coattails, old man.

449
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:41,447
Settle back, John,

450
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:44,316
or this old man
will kick your ass.

451
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:57,663
You know, Joe,

452
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,431
the first time
they told me about you,

453
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,601
the first time
I seen you,

454
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,337
I wanted no part
of Joe Louis.

455
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,208
Why not?

456
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,078
I knew you were
too nice to be a champ.

457
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,181
Couldn't see you finding
that killer instinct.

458
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,648
Now, in order
for you to go...

459
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:21,921
Chappie, I can't
hear this right now.

460
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,890
I just can't.

461
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,827
(applause and cheering)

462
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,104
Thank you.

463
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,123
I couldn't wait
to come home to you.

464
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,992
You've come home
to much more than me.

465
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,295
Thank you.

466
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,291
Crowd: Sieg Heil!

467
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,966
Sieg Heil!

468
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,177
(doorbell buzzing)

469
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:53,512
Good evening, Fraulein.

470
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,347
Herr Schemling.

471
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,985
Before we leave, I 'll need
your signature on
this manuscript.

472
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:08,427
"Boxing as a race problem?"

473
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,029
Yes.

474
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,399
Please sign at the bottom
of the forward.

475
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,502
Why would I do that?

476
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,470
Because you wrote it.

477
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,377
We don't want to be late.

478
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:28,614
I'll read it over
and sign it another time.

479
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,661
Woman: You have so
many fans here.

480
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,163
When I win.

481
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:19,665
How many people do you think
were there when you landed?

482
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,633
I don't know,
ten, twenty thousand, maybe.

483
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,402
They all came
because of her.

484
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,255
You look quite banged up,
Herr Schemling.

485
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,891
Oh, you should
see the other guy.

486
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,460
He only needs
one good eye for hunting,

487
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,431
which is all he
really wants to do anyway.

488
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,766
It is an honor to meet you.

489
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,569
There are precious few
actresses with your talent,

490
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,306
and none as pretty.

491
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,874
You must be very
proud of your husband.

492
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,643
I am.

493
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,113
I am very proud of her.

494
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,918
Isn't it interesting,
Herr Schemling,

495
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,321
You won
the European Championship

496
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:16,688
just as I came to power,

497
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:21,193
and now it seems we're both
destined for greater things.

498
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,197
Yes.

499
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,601
Herr Schemling,
at what point were you certain

500
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,204
you had him beaten?

501
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,208
To be honest, not before
Donovan counted him out.

502
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:41,713
You perceived a flaw
in the negro's nature,

503
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,150
a weakness.

504
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,684
The last time
I looked at my face,

505
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:46,818
if there was any weakness,

506
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,321
it certainly wasn't
in his right hand.

507
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,692
He was not the same
after round four.

508
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,594
True.

509
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,629
And why not?

510
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:01,633
I stung him
with a counter right.

511
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:05,437
Herr Schemling found a flaw
in the negro's constitution,

512
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:09,508
and exploited this weakness
until he was vanquished.

513
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:19,418
The negro is inferior.

514
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,188
He will always
be afraid of you.

515
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:29,361
This fight will not be
part of the weekly newsreel.

516
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,399
It will be shown as a main
feature throughout The Reich!

517
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,470
Oh, hello, David.

518
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,472
I hope I'm not coming
inappropriately.
Oh, no.

519
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:14,740
Is Max at home?

520
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,575
Max, David's
here for you.

521
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,311
David, how are you?

522
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,780
I brought
something for you.

523
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,450
It just came in
and I thought of you.

524
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,827
That will be
perfect for hunting.

525
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,597
Oh, no, this is
too nice for hunting.

526
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,699
This is beautiful.

527
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,768
Thank you, David.

528
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,005
Max, would you
do something for me

529
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,874
the next time
you're in the store?

530
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,543
Of course, what is it?

531
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,846
A matter of
professional exactitude.

532
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:01,920
You purchased this suit
from me a year ago.

533
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,021
I'm uncomfortable
with the way

534
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,624
the Jacket pulls
at the shoulder.

535
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,698
If you bring it in, we'll be
happy to make the adjustment,

536
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:16,034
free of charge.

537
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:18,637
This Jacket
fits me flawlessly.

538
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,810
David, occasionally
photographs tell half-truths.

539
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,746
Half-truths?

540
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:31,650
David, with all those
people at the airfield,

541
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:37,022
the streamers and the pageantry,
Max just did what he had to.

542
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,732
I'll show myself
to the door.

543
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,941
You didn't have
to say that.

544
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,609
He had no right
to accuse you.

545
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,778
He was upset,
I can handle that.

546
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,813
Max, I'm afraid
of our exposure.

547
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,583
How many other national figures
openly have Jewish friends

548
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,951
and business partners?

549
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,886
Some of them do.

550
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,455
Not anymore.

551
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,391
We are different.

552
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,828
How?

553
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,664
You are a movie star,

554
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:23,369
and I am the most popular
athlete in Germany.

555
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:27,639
Look, once I'm champion,
what can they do?

556
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:39,651
Let me spell it out for you,
Jimmy, plain and simple.

557
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,853
You give Schemling
a crack at the title,

558
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,522
America turns on you.

559
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:46,124
Schmeling beat your boy,
he deserves it.

560
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:49,227
Jimmy, no offense,
I like you,

561
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:52,831
but we both know your next fight
will be your last as champ.

562
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,966
You can go to hell,
we're out of here.

563
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,535
Sit down.

564
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:05,677
So America turns on me
if I fight the Nazi,

565
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,279
and all the promoters in town
turn on me if I give the shot

566
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:10,416
to a negro.

567
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,086
I lose either way.

568
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,423
Would ten percent
of Joe's winnings

569
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:22,461
for the rest of his career
make you feel like a winner?

570
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,663
For the rest
of his career?

571
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,234
Why do you want
this so bad?

572
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,269
The belt goes to Germany,

573
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:33,472
ain't no telling when
it's coming back.

574
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,445
Fifteen percent.

575
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:43,849
You know what?
Go fight the Nazi.

576
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,451
And when you lose,

577
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:49,020
my grandkids will read about
it in their history books.

578
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,158
Now that's ten percent
of everything?

579
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,027
After my cut.
Which is?

580
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,963
Thirty-seven percent.

581
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,705
You deserve every penny.

582
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,840
Good.

583
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,676
Thanks.
Good.

584
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:12,778
If you can bring
us that title,

585
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,580
I can take another
nip of the sauce.

586
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,147
You sure that's
a good idea?

587
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,651
Oh, the sweet science is going
to get real bitter for a while.

588
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,153
Oh, careful, son,
careful, son.

589
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,556
It's going to be me and you,
and mostly me.

590
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,492
Come on!

591
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,427
Plant, pivot, rotate!

592
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,799
Why don't you just stop?

593
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:37,135
Stop lying to yourself!
You don't want to fight!

594
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,571
Why don't you just go home?

595
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,873
It's okay,
it's okay to give up.

596
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:48,514
Maybe you can get your old job
back on the assembly line.

597
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,649
Show me something.

598
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:54,786
Rotate, come on!

599
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,888
Why don't you just
quit and go home?

600
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,725
A real fighter wouldn't
throw that soft shit,

601
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:02,093
or stand there
feeling sorry for himself.

602
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,807
Joe: Now, that's
a beautiful ring.

603
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:17,976
I have to say,
I've got pretty good taste.

604
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,077
Surprised you, didn't I?

605
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,879
Yes, you did.

606
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,014
I've always been
partial to diamonds.

607
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,821
Marva.

608
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,323
I'm going to close my eyes,

609
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,392
and when they open,
you best be in a taxi

610
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,162
back to whichever
whorehouse you came from.

611
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,311
Hello, Thomas.

612
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,881
Mrs. Louis?

613
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,215
Excuse me.

614
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:02,053
I won't be
embarrassed by you.

615
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,723
I refuse to be humiliated.

616
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:10,996
I didn't mean to embarrass you
or humiliate you.

617
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:12,030
It's just that...

618
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,265
Women are like this menu.

619
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,835
Can't expect you
to eat steak every night?

620
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,675
Baby, what are you doing?

621
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,344
What am I doing?

622
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:31,182
What's happened to you?

623
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:35,120
If I'm going to
go on being Mrs. Joe Louis,

624
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,022
here's how things will be.

625
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,393
You will not take
any of your lady friends

626
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,196
to any of our places,

627
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,632
and you will always
park in clear view

628
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:50,268
so I'll have
no more surprises.

629
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:54,840
And if you're out late,
don't you dare come home.

630
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,242
Do we understand
each other?

631
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,315
Excuse me.

632
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,463
Remembering:
Joe Louis will be as honest
and generous a champion

633
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:21,499
as America could dare hope for.

634
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,169
There were so many people
counting on me.

635
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,037
Six a.m. Finds
the sepia slugger

636
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,806
out for his daily run,

637
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:30,676
knocking off miles as naturally
as he knocks out opponents.

638
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,243
Chappie, folks used to say
I was a natural,

639
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,680
but there wasn't a damn thing
natural about it.

640
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,983
Running six miles at dawn,
training all day long,

641
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,719
climbing into a ring with
somebody who means to hurt you.

642
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,154
That's what
a crazy man does.

643
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:51,229
You got to decide just
how crazy you're going to be.

644
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:55,300
I can't decide for you.

645
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:02,808
Chappie?

646
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,468
Good afternoon, sir.

647
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:33,004
Would you please
ring Joe Jacobs?

648
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,439
Excuse me.

649
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,475
Joe Jacobs, please.

650
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,277
Herr Jacobs is
not a guest here.

651
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,748
The law forbids me from
honoring his reservation.

652
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:45,516
Why? Herr Jacobs is American.

653
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,253
Herr Jacobs is a Jew.

654
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,230
His stay will be short.

655
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,966
Can an exception be made?

656
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,233
Sorry, no.

657
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,442
Modesty aside, are you
aware of my public stature?

658
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,311
I'm well aware,
Herr Schemling.

659
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:17,382
Your victory was
a golden moment for us all.

660
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:20,618
I would consider it an honor
to receive you and your family

661
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:23,321
at my training facilities.

662
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,025
Please contact
The Ministry of Sports

663
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,794
at your convenience.

664
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,503
He's in the bar.

665
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:40,205
Thank you.

666
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,243
Excuse me,
can I get a drink here?

667
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,412
Welcome to
the continental hotel.

668
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:50,816
Seig Heil.

669
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,184
You're all set now.

670
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:56,287
Last woman treated me as bad
as her, I married the bitch.

671
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,324
Hey, let's have
some champagne.

672
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:03,962
Maxie, you won't be
getting the title shot.

673
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:09,367
Who are they
giving it to?

674
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:10,535
Louis.

675
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,270
Louis!

676
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,842
What can I say,
we was robbed.

677
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,211
This is impossible.

678
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,246
We didn't get the votes.

679
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:24,015
Farley was the only one
who stood up for us.

680
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,351
You've been branded,
you're Hitler's boy.

681
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,520
I'm just an athlete,
I'm not a politician.

682
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,123
The anti-Nazi league
sees it different.

683
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:39,364
What are they
calling you?

684
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:42,267
A traitor
to my country.

685
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:43,869
Doesn't matter.

686
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,904
I'm a businessman and nothing
but no one's going to stop me

687
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,272
from plying my trade.

688
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,107
What's more
American than that?

689
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:59,250
Maxie, you just be ready,
because when I'm done,

690
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:03,121
those bastards will give you
a shot just to shut me up.

691
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:18,904
Remember, Braddock's going to
come at you from the bell.

692
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,305
He's going to want
an Irish brawl,

693
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:23,108
that's the only
chance he's got.

694
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,542
What are you going to do?

695
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:27,745
Stick and counter,
stick and counter.

696
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:31,116
And then?

697
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,283
Nothing,
until you say shoot.

698
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:41,726
What's that gun?
You expecting trouble?

699
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,361
Uh-huh.

700
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:50,268
You know, there was another
reason why I didn't take you on

701
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,637
the first time I saw you.

702
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:53,939
Why is that?

703
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,311
You're the wrong color.

704
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,580
I didn't think another
colored man would contend

705
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,116
after Jack Johnson rubbed
white folks' noses in it.

706
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:12,190
Chappie, you can't win
by a decision tonight.

707
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:14,059
I got to
knock him out.

708
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:20,198
Let these be
the referee here.

709
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,039
So why did you?

710
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,574
Why did I what?

711
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:31,042
Take me on.

712
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,681
I needed the money.

713
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:39,985
(laughing)

714
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:46,057
D.O.A.,
dead on your ass.

715
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:02,273
Radio announcer:
Here in the 7th round,
Joe Louis is trying to become

716
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:05,776
the first negro champion
since 1908.

717
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,413
Braddock throwing Louis
into the ropes.

718
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:12,017
The ring here at Comiskey Park
is surrounded by police.

719
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,418
Get off the ropes!

720
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:15,586
Come on, Joe, come on!

721
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:30,035
Braddock, manhandling Louis,
puts him into the ropes again.

722
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,570
Come on, come on.

723
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,305
The champ is taunting
the young challenger

724
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,407
like a playground bully!

725
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:43,514
He's out, he's out.

726
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,683
This fight is over!

727
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,718
A new world champion!

728
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:52,323
23-year-old Joe Louis
makes history tonight!

729
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:55,126
Ringside announcer:
The winner by knockout,

730
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:59,330
and new heavyweight
champion of the world,

731
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,700
Joe Louis!

732
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:12,277
Hold it up
a little higher, Joe.

733
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:13,444
How about a smile?

734
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,046
Hey, you really
got him with a left.

735
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,082
I got him
with my right, too.

736
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:20,185
So, Joe, how does it
feel to be champ?

737
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,156
I'm no champ until
I beat Max Schemling.

738
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,138
Well, Herr Schemling.
This is unexpected.

739
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,207
Herr Goebbels,
what can I do for you?

740
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:45,343
We would be encouraged
to see you join the party.

741
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:48,246
Many months have passed
waiting for you to do so.

742
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:51,182
Well, my life is about boxing,
that's my priority.

743
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:54,719
You would do well to shift
priorities from yourself

744
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:57,088
to the fatherland.

745
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,589
Won't the heavyweight
championship bring glory

746
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,659
to the fatherland?

747
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,295
Your professional
relationship with Joe Jacobs

748
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,331
must be terminated
immediately.

749
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,673
I've accommodated
your wishes.

750
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,742
I've been photographed
at your request.

751
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:18,943
I've given interviews.

752
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:21,546
I've lent my name
for various purposes.

753
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,281
But this is out of bounds.

754
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:25,616
The way I conduct my
corner is my own business.

755
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,752
Not when a Jew
is involved.

756
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,293
On whose orders am
I being told to break ties?

757
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:38,163
On whose orders?

758
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,830
Mine.

759
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,670
I wish to speak
to the Fuhrer.

760
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,839
Good day.

761
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,441
Madame.

762
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:12,290
Thank you.

763
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:28,439
Mein Fuhrer, I appreciate
you seeing us on short notice.

764
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,341
Please.

765
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:37,482
Which sort of cake
do you prefer?

766
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:40,485
Guglhupf, please.

767
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:45,690
Does the lady
mean the napfkuchen?

768
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,292
I haven't heard
it called guglhupf

769
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:49,794
since I was last
in Czechoslovakia.

770
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,729
I was raised in Prague.

771
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,765
Ah, beautiful
old German Prague.

772
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,772
The time is fast approaching
when your homeland

773
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:05,843
will be reunited
with Germany.

774
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:12,783
I understand you wish me

775
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:15,152
to split from
my manager, Joe Jacobs.

776
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,923
In name, he is Jewish,
but his real religion is boxing.

777
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:21,792
More tea?

778
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,661
No, thank you.

779
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,796
A German manager
got me nowhere.

780
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:28,666
Jacobs is my only chance
to fight in America.

781
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,537
In that case,
you will fight here.

782
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,104
The title will
never come here.

783
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,441
I have to win it in America.

784
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,946
Allow me
to understand you fully.

785
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:48,753
A German's only possibility
of becoming the world champion

786
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,422
hinges on a Jew's influence?

787
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,062
The man is greatly
respected in New York.

788
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,964
Answer my question.

789
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:06,571
Yes.

790
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,578
Yes, what?

791
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:18,383
Yes, I need his influence
to get the title.

792
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,900
Make sure your husband
wins a lot

793
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,437
so we can see
each other more often.

794
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,143
Max!

795
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:21,145
Hey, Max!

796
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,913
Your manager calling.

797
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:26,617
Jacobs.

798
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,526
So?

799
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:38,028
Maxie, what's
the weather doing there?

800
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,297
Forget about the weather,
what happened?

801
00:56:40,465 --> 00:56:43,601
Berlin, sunny one minute,
it's snowing the next.

802
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:46,771
I haven't set my foot
outside the gym for a week.

803
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,639
So why don't
you take a break?

804
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,542
Come over, we'll go
sunbathing at Coney Island,

805
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:52,743
and while you're at it,

806
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:55,079
you might as well fight
Joe Louis for the belt.

807
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:58,783
I love you!

808
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:00,751
Max, Max...

809
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,953
All right,
I got the fight!

810
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:07,958
He's going to
be in top form.

811
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:09,594
That's good.

812
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,696
Then we're agreed.

813
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:20,705
If Maxie wins,
you're our promoter.

814
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,544
Hey, what would Joe do if
he found out you were playing

815
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,746
both sides of the fence?

816
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:31,148
Don't get any smart ideas.

817
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:35,520
Look, Joe protects his chin
so he won't get hurt.

818
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,987
I'm just doing the same.

819
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:49,734
Wish me luck.

820
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,969
Take me with you.

821
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,638
You know they would
never allow that.

822
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,205
Things would
be different there.

823
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,109
Anny, I could not
live anywhere else.

824
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,811
This is our home.

825
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:12,122
Good luck, Max.

826
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,558
I love you.

827
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,299
Reporter:
Max Schemling is aiming
for the world heavyweight title

828
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:25,703
in the most important
sporting event of our time.

829
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:28,005
2nd reporter:
Joe Louis was summoned
to the oval office

830
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,974
by President Roosevelt

831
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:32,142
and told that America
was counting on him

832
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,778
against the Nazis,

833
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:36,647
while protesters gathered in
major cities across the country

834
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,716
to condemn the German
propaganda campaign

835
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,250
leading up to this fight.

836
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:48,593
(crowd outside chanting)
No more Nazis!
No more Nazis!

837
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:59,036
You should get
something to eat.

838
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:02,973
I'm not hungry.

839
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:09,814
Can you believe what those
idiots are doing down there?

840
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:21,225
Help me get this shit
out of here, huh?

841
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:22,693
Burn it all!

842
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:35,339
Well, this is a hell of a time
you pick to lay down.

843
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,374
I spend years breaking my ass
to get us here,

844
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:38,809
you're going to let
a sea of strangers

845
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,845
talk you out of taking
that bastard's belt?

846
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:45,950
Those people down there,

847
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,986
nothing you say or do is
going to change their minds.

848
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:53,824
Roosevelt and Louis have got
them convinced you're a Nazi!

849
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,760
I'm not a goddamn Nazi!

850
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,095
I'm just a fighter.

851
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:01,298
So, your fire
ain't dead after all.

852
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,634
Just watch what
you call me, Joe.

853
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:05,836
Then show everyone
who you really are, Maxie,

854
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,738
the best fucking
fighter in the world.

855
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:18,215
I put him down once,
I'll do it again.

856
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,050
Reporter:
The Nazi superman Schemling

857
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,220
says he's ready to
lay claim to the title.

858
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,955
Joe: every time
I get in the ring...

859
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,924
every punch I throw...

860
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:28,192
gets me closer
to Max Schemling.

861
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,294
Max: You know,
people said I was lucky

862
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,697
to beat Joe Louis
the first time around.

863
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:34,431
But on the night of June 22nd,

864
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,668
I'll show them luck had
nothing to do with it.

865
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,972
Reporter:
Are you gun-shy
about facing Max again?

866
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,540
Joe:
Why would I be?

867
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,243
Schmeling's two years older,
and I'm two years smarter.

868
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,081
Max:
well, I didn't come
over here for fun.

869
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,186
Reporter:
When Joe Louis steps
into the ring tonight,

870
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:59,389
he carries the flag of
America and democracy.

871
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,859
Man:
Tonight in Yankee Stadium,

872
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:06,496
with god's help
and your prayers,

873
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:10,367
Joe Louis will do
more for our race

874
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:15,272
than any man
since Abraham Lincoln.

875
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:18,008
Joe Louis don't smoke.

876
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:23,380
Joe Louis don't pour no red-hot
liquor down his throat!

877
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,450
Joe Louis,
the family man.

878
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:31,555
Joe Louis,
the avenging angel!

879
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:33,858
Max remembering:
Isn't it interesting,
Herr Schemling?

880
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:36,393
We are both destined
for greater things.

881
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:39,596
I'm just an athlete,
not a politician.

882
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:43,000
Man:
Joe Louis,
the answer to our prayers!

883
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,935
Good luck

1060
01:17:58,207 --> 01:17:59,843
I just need you
to sign here at the bottom.

1061
01:17:59,943 --> 01:18:02,078
Easy now,
don't get ahead of yourself.

1062
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,748
We'll have every kid in America
drinking Joe Louis milk

1063
01:18:04,814 --> 01:18:07,050
while mom and dad relax
with a refreshing bottle

1064
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,818
of Joe Louis punch.

1065
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:12,856
Marva!

1066
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,331
This is all your shit.

1067
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,933
Marva!

1068
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,171
Stop!

1069
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,180
Marva baby, please.

1070
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:41,785
Marva, come back to camp.

1071
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:43,319
I'm going to take
the rest of the week off,

1072
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:45,221
the rest of the month off.

1073
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,790
Please, baby.

1074
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,157
I'm going to kick
everybody out,

1075
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:50,293
and you and me,
we can just talk things through.

1076
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,399
Marva, don't leave me, please.

1077
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:08,812
Marva, now is our time.

1078
01:19:10,113 --> 01:19:13,449
Our time?

1079
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:17,386
When was it ever our time, Joe?

1080
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:22,625
All the gifts,
the good life,

1081
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:26,395
it was just guilt money
for all your whoring.

1082
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,966
I've tried, Joe,
I can't anymore.

1083
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:33,669
I was raised with
so much of nothing.

1084
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:35,004
I had all these wants inside.

1085
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,139
I wanted this,
I wanted that,

1086
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,273
I wanted everything.

1087
01:19:43,046 --> 01:19:44,347
I always loved you.

1088
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,286
I know you love me.

1089
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:56,092
People change.

1090
01:19:58,094 --> 01:19:59,328
Yes...

1091
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,066
Yes they do.

1092
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:14,077
Goodbye.

1093
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:41,905
(piano music)

1094
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,351
(shouting in distance)

1095
01:21:29,152 --> 01:21:30,653
(knocking on door)

1096
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:35,558
Help us!
Help us!

1097
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:44,367
Follow her.

1098
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:45,568
Now, Anny!

1099
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,985
Open the door!

1100
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:04,253
(banging on door)

1101
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:05,588
Open the door!

1102
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:14,130
Where are they?

1103
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,198
There's no one here.

1104
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:24,407
You know who
we're here for.

1105
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:26,742
You and you,
check this room.

1106
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:29,012
You two check the balcony.

1107
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:30,213
And the rest with me.

1108
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,322
My wife is trying to sleep.

1109
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:42,725
Your head will roll if
the Fuhrer learns about this!

1110
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:44,860
This is an empty threat.

1111
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:48,097
You no longer exist for
Herr Goebbels and the Fuhrer.

1112
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:49,732
Get out of my house now!

1113
01:22:57,106 --> 01:23:00,043
Max, what is going on?

1114
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,520
Check the other apartments.

1115
01:23:39,782 --> 01:23:41,517
Say goodbye to Anny.

1116
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:44,187
I will.

1117
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:45,288
Thank you.

1118
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,659
We'll see you again.

1119
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,132
You had no right
to do that.

1120
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:36,739
Do you know how close we were
to going to prison?

1121
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:42,145
To losing everything,
being split apart?

1122
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,249
What choice was there?

1123
01:24:46,349 --> 01:24:47,750
Leave the Levins
to The Gestapo?

1124
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:54,690
You think that
you're untouchable,

1125
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:55,758
but you're not.

1126
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,763
We're just as vulnerable as
all the enemies of the Reich.

1127
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:02,865
Anny...

1128
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:10,539
Why didn't you
watch out for us, Max?

1129
01:25:15,378 --> 01:25:17,480
It would have been so easy
just to distance yourself

1130
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,317
from a few people and
join the party quietly.

1131
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:23,319
I couldn't do those things.

1132
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:28,457
No, I suppose not.

1133
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:30,226
That would have been
for our benefit.

1134
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:33,496
What are you saying?

1135
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:38,367
You played along
when it suited you.

1136
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:40,936
You did whatever was best
for your boxing career.

1137
01:25:41,204 --> 01:25:42,405
If that was true,

1138
01:25:42,505 --> 01:25:45,308
I would have divorced you and
married a pure-blood German.

1139
01:25:45,408 --> 01:25:46,442
Maybe you should have.

1140
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:48,311
Yeah, maybe I should have!

1141
01:25:48,411 --> 01:25:49,878
For you, being a Nazi
is just another part,

1142
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,647
just another role to play!

1143
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,316
That's right.

1144
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:56,885
I would put on
any mask to survive.

1145
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,687
And don't you think
for one second

1146
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,223
you're any better than me.

1147
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,533
The whole world
thinks you're a Nazi.

1148
01:26:10,633 --> 01:26:11,934
This is enough!

1149
01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:25,381
what is happening to us?

1150
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:29,952
I know that
I'm not untouchable.

1151
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:42,931
I'm just as scared
as you are.

1152
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:47,736
Anny, I know I 've done
some things wrong.

1153
01:26:51,274 --> 01:26:53,742
Can't you see that hiding
the Levins was right?

1154
01:26:57,346 --> 01:27:01,817
The problem is what is right
can't help us now.

1155
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:12,895
Maximillian Schemling
weighs in at 188 pounds.

1156
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,068
such prominence here today.

1157
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,471
You must really have
some connections, huh?

1158
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:35,318
(gunshots)

1159
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:12,488
Chappie would never
tell me his age.

1160
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,760
He always said he was just
old enough to be my daddy.

1161
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,878
I keep losing the people
I need most.

1162
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:42,418
Announcer:
It is my distinct honor
to introduce to you all

1163
01:28:42,518 --> 01:28:44,887
a very special man in uniform.

1164
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:49,492
Here he is, The Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

1165
01:28:49,592 --> 01:28:55,398
the Brown Bomber himself,
sergeant Joe Louis!

1166
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:10,813
Joe, you have long been an
inspiration to the negro race.

1167
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:13,248
Your decision to fight
exhibition bouts

1168
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:15,418
and to contribute your purses

1169
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:18,554
to the army and navy
relief societies

1170
01:29:18,654 --> 01:29:24,427
is a generous bet on patriotism
and love of our entire country.

1171
01:29:30,165 --> 01:29:34,470
I'm only doing what any other
red-blooded American would do.

1172
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:38,240
Our soldiers are fighting
the real fight overseas.

1173
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,911
And we'll do our part
and we will win,

1174
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:45,448
because we're on God's side.

1175
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:48,083
On God's side!

1176
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:49,818
How about that?

1177
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:14,076
(baby crying)

1178
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,375
That's perfect.

1179
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:49,712
(announcement from truck)
Stand back!
Clear the street!

1180
01:30:54,082 --> 01:30:56,652
Anny: Max, what do you
think they want?

1181
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:58,554
I don't know.

1182
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:08,531
Hello, officers.

1183
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:11,700
Would you show us
your building permit?

1184
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,536
I applied for a permit
three months ago.

1185
01:31:13,636 --> 01:31:15,103
We're still waiting.

1186
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:17,873
I'm sure ours
will be here soon.

1187
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:22,310
Allied command does not grant
permits to famous Nazis.

1188
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:26,615
Every G.I. In Europe was after
your god damn dog tags.

1189
01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:28,551
Now move away
from the structure.

1190
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:29,785
Move away? Why?

1191
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:31,353
Move away from the structure!

1192
01:31:31,453 --> 01:31:32,855
This place is coming down!

1193
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,793
You can't do this.

1194
01:31:39,027 --> 01:31:41,029
You need to step aside.

1195
01:31:51,707 --> 01:31:53,275
No!

1196
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:56,078
Max!

1197
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,734
Stop!

1198
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:43,992
News announcer:
Louis sends Wolcott
face first to the canvas,

1199
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:45,628
the latest member
of Joltin' Joe's

1200
01:32:45,694 --> 01:32:47,195
bum of the month club.

1201
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:49,898
The proud champion
is bloody, but not bowed.

1202
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:51,033
Joe: after 25 title defenses,

1203
01:32:51,133 --> 01:32:54,269
I hereby am retiring
from professional boxing.

1204
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:56,839
I figure after 11 years and what
is it, Uncle Mike,

1205
01:32:56,939 --> 01:33:01,443
three days, four days,
I'm needing a little rest.

1206
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:04,046
I hereby relinquish my title
to be held in trust

1207
01:33:04,146 --> 01:33:05,180
for the man to follow me

1208
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,751
as Heavyweight
Champion of the World.

1209
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:11,920
I want to go out on top
just like you, champ.

1210
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,956
I'm finished in
the fight game.

1211
01:33:14,056 --> 01:33:15,991
What are you going to do
with your time?

1212
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,826
What am I going to
do with my time?

1213
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,361
Well, that's simple.

1214
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,004
You really
sent that one, Joe.

1215
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:32,374
I'm seeing green, boys.

1216
01:33:32,675 --> 01:33:34,142
Seeing green.

1217
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:39,848
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I'm looking for Mr. Joe Louis.

1218
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:50,192
Gentlemen,
I prefer large bills.

1219
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:53,128
You're cleaning
me out, Joe.

1220
01:33:53,228 --> 01:33:54,830
All right.

1221
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,464
Excuse me, Mr. Louis?

1222
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:57,833
Hey, how you doing?

1223
01:33:57,933 --> 01:33:59,401
Mr. Louis,
my name is Lawrence Paulson.

1224
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:01,804
I'm with the Internal
Revenue Service.

1225
01:34:01,904 --> 01:34:04,372
I've left a
number of messages.

1226
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,041
Well, we're about
to go through again,

1227
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:08,176
give my friends a chance
to win their money back.

1228
01:34:08,276 --> 01:34:10,112
This won't take long.

1229
01:34:10,212 --> 01:34:12,114
All right.

1230
01:34:12,214 --> 01:34:14,116
Go on ahead.
I'll catch up.

1231
01:34:14,216 --> 01:34:17,152
We'll see you at
the first tee, Joe.

1232
01:34:17,252 --> 01:34:20,322
One question is all I have,
Mr. Louis.

1233
01:34:20,422 --> 01:34:22,725
Call me Joe.

1234
01:34:22,825 --> 01:34:25,994
Considering your recent decision
to retire from boxing,

1235
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:29,097
how do you plan to
repay your government?

1236
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:30,398
As of this morning,

1237
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:38,173
your back taxes and penalties
amount to $1,243,097.

1238
01:34:38,273 --> 01:34:41,176
You should talk to my guys.

1239
01:34:41,276 --> 01:34:44,747
Mr. Jacobs and John Roxborough
register zero debt.

1240
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:47,182
We have qualms
with neither of them.

1241
01:34:47,282 --> 01:34:49,885
What about the purses I donated
to army and navy relief,

1242
01:34:49,985 --> 01:34:51,353
don't they count?

1243
01:34:51,453 --> 01:34:53,856
I fought 96 exhibitions
for the troops during the war.

1244
01:34:53,956 --> 01:34:55,323
I gave to a hundred
different charities.

1245
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:56,324
Mr. Louis...

1246
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:58,160
I said call me Joe,
god damn it.

1247
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:00,595
You owe taxes on those purses.

1248
01:35:00,763 --> 01:35:04,767
The IRS simply wants to know
how you plan to make amends.

1249
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:06,769
Good day, sir.

1250
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:20,983
News announcer:
Marciano sends Louis sprawling!

1251
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,024
Joe Louis is hurt,

1252
01:35:29,124 --> 01:35:32,094
and he's taking every second
of that eight count.

1253
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:39,334
Here comes Rocky again,
couple of weak jabs from Joe.

1254
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:42,404
Body shots from Marciano,
all landing!

1255
01:35:42,504 --> 01:35:44,039
Joe tries to fight him off,

1256
01:35:44,139 --> 01:35:47,943
Marciano is pummeling Joe
against the ropes!

1257
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,461
Marciano stuck Louis
through the ropes!

1258
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:07,863
He's finished!

1259
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:10,065
Joe Louis is finished!

1260
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,414
Come on.

1261
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:41,196
God damn it!

1262
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,931
I just fixed this thing.

1263
01:36:51,006 --> 01:36:52,941
Would you get my
tool box, please?

1264
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:23,405
Farley!

1265
01:37:23,505 --> 01:37:24,539
How are you, Max?

1266
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:25,908
I'm fine, just fine.

1267
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:27,109
It's good to see you.

1268
01:37:27,209 --> 01:37:30,045
Anny, this is Jim Farley
from The Boxing Commission.

1269
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:31,546
I remember your name.

1270
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:33,081
You were always
very fair with Max.

1271
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,216
I tried.

1272
01:37:34,316 --> 01:37:36,118
So what are you doing
all the way out here?

1273
01:37:36,218 --> 01:37:37,920
Well, I might ask you
the same thing.

1274
01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:40,722
Last I heard, you went back
in the ring after the war.

1275
01:37:40,822 --> 01:37:43,926
Yeah, we bought this with
what I made from my last bout.

1276
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:47,395
Hey, did you
go out a winner?

1277
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:49,297
No.

1278
01:37:49,397 --> 01:37:51,566
Farley:
So, I decided it was
as good a time as any

1279
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,268
to get out of the fight game.

1280
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:56,771
I've been with
Coca-Cola ever since.

1281
01:37:56,939 --> 01:38:00,943
Two weeks ago, I was in
a board meeting in Atlanta

1282
01:38:01,009 --> 01:38:04,246
and I suggested that
we bring you on, Max.

1283
01:38:04,346 --> 01:38:05,413
The board agreed.

1284
01:38:08,951 --> 01:38:10,218
In what capacity?

1285
01:38:10,318 --> 01:38:12,187
Spokesman.

1286
01:38:12,287 --> 01:38:15,123
The position would
entail a handsome salary

1287
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:17,525
and a generous travel allowance.

1288
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,561
We used to love to travel.

1289
01:38:24,032 --> 01:38:25,333
You must be joking.

1290
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:27,602
With all my name
brings to mind.

1291
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:29,537
Well, back in America,

1292
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:32,540
I agree your name may not
be regarded kindly,

1293
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,643
but here, well I think people
are going to remember

1294
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,045
what you did in the ring,

1295
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:40,182
not the flag unfurled
in the background.

1296
01:38:40,282 --> 01:38:43,986
This country is
desperate for better times.

1297
01:38:44,086 --> 01:38:46,554
You were a central part
of those in the past.

1298
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:49,157
Together with Coke,
you will be again.

1299
01:38:58,766 --> 01:38:59,701
I don't know.

1300
01:38:59,801 --> 01:39:01,036
Max...

1301
01:39:02,204 --> 01:39:05,373
Max, you can
stay hands off.

1302
01:39:05,473 --> 01:39:07,742
What we really want is
your name associated with us

1303
01:39:07,842 --> 01:39:10,578
when we blitz
the German market.

1304
01:39:10,678 --> 01:39:12,047
Blitz?

1305
01:39:12,147 --> 01:39:16,518
Oh, yeah, it's just a business
term we use nowadays.

1306
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:19,354
Coke follows
thirst everywhere.

1307
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:21,089
That's our new slogan.

1308
01:39:23,425 --> 01:39:26,428
We followed it here, Maxie.

1309
01:39:41,509 --> 01:39:43,811
So here's our last mock-up.

1310
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:45,480
Now, the essence
of the campaign is

1311
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,184
"Take a break with coke
wherever you are."

1312
01:39:49,284 --> 01:39:52,254
We plan to launch the campaign
six weeks from today.

1313
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:54,756
So what do
you think, Max?

1314
01:39:59,294 --> 01:40:03,565
I think...I think
it looks great.

1315
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,467
Glad to hear it.

1316
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:06,668
Well then,
that's enough business.

1317
01:40:06,768 --> 01:40:08,603
Let's take a break.

1318
01:40:08,703 --> 01:40:12,440
So tell us what it was like
to face Joe Louis.

1319
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:15,343
You managed to fight
the perfect fight against Joe.

1320
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:19,247
Are you talking about the first
one or the second one?

1321
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,816
Joe may have won that battle,
but you have won the war.

1322
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:24,186
Debt, divorce,
you name it.

1323
01:40:24,286 --> 01:40:25,853
He's going down
for the count.

1324
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,122
You aren't kidding.

1325
01:40:27,222 --> 01:40:28,223
He's about to
fight Cowboy Rocky

1326
01:40:28,323 --> 01:40:31,159
on the pro wrestling circuit.

1327
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:34,362
I think that we might have gone
up against a Joe Louis soda

1328
01:40:34,462 --> 01:40:36,664
in south America or somewhere.

1329
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:38,133
It was no contest.

1330
01:40:38,233 --> 01:40:41,236
So Max, tell us about
the fights with Jack Sharky.

1331
01:40:41,336 --> 01:40:43,671
I think we've tortured
Max enough for one day.

1332
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:45,140
Let's eat.

1333
01:40:50,445 --> 01:40:51,379
Thank you.

1334
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:52,847
You're welcome, sir.

1335
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,783
Excuse me, sir,
I hate to intrude.

1336
01:40:55,883 --> 01:41:01,423
See, where I come from,
where I grew up that is,

1337
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:05,660
folks around the way drummed up
some pretty deep hatred for you.

1338
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,763
But I used to look to Joe,

1339
01:41:08,863 --> 01:41:12,534
and he ain't never said
a bad word about you.

1340
01:41:12,634 --> 01:41:14,769
So I never did.

1341
01:41:16,304 --> 01:41:18,206
Joe was a good man.

1342
01:41:18,306 --> 01:41:22,477
He made me proud,
very proud to be black.

1343
01:41:24,612 --> 01:41:26,148
And proud to
be an American.

1344
01:41:29,551 --> 01:41:31,219
Hey, clear
this table, please.

1345
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:32,720
Yes, sir.

1346
01:41:40,162 --> 01:41:41,563
Max: where is Joe living now?

1347
01:41:41,663 --> 01:41:42,830
Louis?

1348
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,167
He lives on
the south side of Chicago.

1349
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:49,371
Max, where are you going?

1350
01:41:53,675 --> 01:41:54,642
Excuse me.

1351
01:41:54,742 --> 01:41:55,610
Do you know,
by any chance,

1352
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,512
where I can find Joe Louis?

1353
01:42:00,182 --> 01:42:02,484
How am I supposed to know
where Joe Louis spends his days?

1354
01:42:05,553 --> 01:42:07,189
Max: I 'm looking for Joe Louis.

1355
01:42:07,255 --> 01:42:08,290
Do you know where
I can find him?

1356
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:10,458
Man: Joe Louis?
I got no idea.

1357
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:11,559
Woman: Joe Louis?

1358
01:42:11,659 --> 01:42:12,660
Last I heard, he was living

1359
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,462
somewhere around
81st and Halsted.

1360
01:42:14,562 --> 01:42:15,830
Operator:
I'm sorry, sir, Joe Louis '
number is not listed.

1361
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:18,200
Man: Try the Archway Lounge
on South Park.

1362
01:42:18,266 --> 01:42:20,768
If you don't find him there,
you got to go club to club.

1363
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:21,836
Max: Club to club?

1364
01:42:21,936 --> 01:42:23,205
Man: It's Saturday, mister.

1365
01:42:23,271 --> 01:42:25,207
Not that day of the week
matters to Joe.

1366
01:42:42,624 --> 01:42:44,226
(blues music)

1367
01:43:11,085 --> 01:43:12,754
What you need here?

1368
01:43:17,091 --> 01:43:19,994
(music stops)

1369
01:43:20,094 --> 01:43:21,829
I don't want any
trouble, mister.

1370
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:23,064
Well, you're going
to get some trouble

1371
01:43:23,164 --> 01:43:25,967
if you don't get your ass
on out of here, man.

1372
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:27,469
Hey!

1373
01:43:30,338 --> 01:43:32,274
He's with me.

1374
01:43:39,414 --> 01:43:41,416
Max.

1375
01:43:41,516 --> 01:43:42,784
Hi, Joe.

1376
01:44:10,945 --> 01:44:12,480
Thanks.

1377
01:44:16,818 --> 01:44:18,620
You look great.

1378
01:44:20,322 --> 01:44:22,324
You, too.

1379
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:28,763
I always did love
a finely tailored suit.

1380
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:33,401
So what brings you to town?

1381
01:44:35,069 --> 01:44:36,838
I was in Atlanta on business.

1382
01:44:36,938 --> 01:44:38,673
Atlanta is a
long way from Chicago.

1383
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:44,412
I wanted to see you.

1384
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,951
I remember the promise
we made to each other.

1385
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,856
Oh, yeah.

1386
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:05,367
So Coke's been
good to you.

1387
01:45:05,867 --> 01:45:07,402
Yeah.

1388
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,005
Before Farley came along,

1389
01:45:11,105 --> 01:45:13,908
Anny and I didn't think we'd see
another season on the farm.

1390
01:45:14,008 --> 01:45:16,678
You, a farmer?

1391
01:45:16,778 --> 01:45:18,045
Yes, a mink farm.

1392
01:45:20,482 --> 01:45:23,385
I thought we'd make a killing
because the coats cost so much.

1393
01:45:23,485 --> 01:45:25,387
A mink farmer.

1394
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:28,055
And they always called you
an intelligent fighter.

1395
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,393
They called me
a lot of things.

1396
01:45:34,295 --> 01:45:37,064
The truth is I moved
to the farm to disappear.

1397
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:41,836
During the war,
every American wanted me dead.

1398
01:45:41,936 --> 01:45:43,971
And now a few years pass,

1399
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:48,075
and Coca-Cola trusts my face
to sell their product.

1400
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:50,912
There's no sense to it.

1401
01:45:54,782 --> 01:45:56,984
Sitting here with Joe,
it just clicked.

1402
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:58,553
I figured out who you was.

1403
01:45:58,653 --> 01:45:59,754
Now, be cool, brother.

1404
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:01,022
Just let us talk.

1405
01:46:01,122 --> 01:46:03,224
Yeah, sure, Joe, sure.

1406
01:46:03,324 --> 01:46:07,094
You feel like dancing,
Maxie, just let me know.

1407
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:08,630
I'll set you up.

1408
01:46:13,768 --> 01:46:16,671
at least he was offering
something and not taking.

1409
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:22,477
I'll tell you, I've been
carrying people my whole life;

1410
01:46:22,577 --> 01:46:25,447
Uncle Mike, Roxie,

1411
01:46:26,848 --> 01:46:28,916
my people,

1412
01:46:29,016 --> 01:46:31,886
my country.

1413
01:46:31,986 --> 01:46:33,521
Where did it get me?

1414
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,892
Chappie always said
if you get knocked down,

1415
01:46:37,992 --> 01:46:39,494
they never let
you forget it.

1416
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:44,065
Yeah.

1417
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:58,746
Sure I can't talk you
into staying tonight?

1418
01:46:58,846 --> 01:47:00,081
Sleep at my place.

1419
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:02,917
I wish I could,
but I have to get back.

1420
01:47:04,786 --> 01:47:06,954
Next time.

1421
01:47:07,054 --> 01:47:10,492
Why don't you come visit
Anny and me in Hamburg?

1422
01:47:10,592 --> 01:47:14,529
Going overseas is steep,
the IRS won't allow that.

1423
01:47:14,629 --> 01:47:17,865
All right, then we put it
on my Coke account.

1424
01:47:17,965 --> 01:47:19,634
All aboard!

1425
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,641
Still got time
for a few rounds.

1426
01:47:26,741 --> 01:47:28,610
Oh, I don't think so.

1427
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:30,512
Third bout would
go the distance.

1428
01:47:30,578 --> 01:47:31,546
Ain't no telling.

1429
01:47:31,646 --> 01:47:33,080
Last time,
I had you out in one.

1430
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:36,684
Don't forget '36.

1431
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,687
I wore you down and down
and then out!

1432
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:40,822
(laughing)

1433
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,962
'38 was the best I ever had.

1434
01:47:48,062 --> 01:47:53,234
'36 was my best.

1435
01:47:53,334 --> 01:47:56,971
people made a lot of
noise when I beat you.

1436
01:47:57,071 --> 01:48:00,274
Said the world got
knocked off its axis,

1437
01:48:00,374 --> 01:48:06,180
a change was going to come.

1438
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:09,316
The poor didn't
suddenly strike it rich.

1439
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:11,853
The desperate didn't
suddenly get a second chance.

1440
01:48:18,059 --> 01:48:19,393
I'll tell you something, Max,

1441
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:22,029
nothing really
changed in America.

1442
01:48:25,366 --> 01:48:27,635
Except it gained a hero.

1443
01:48:44,218 --> 01:48:46,220
Goodbye, Joe.

1444
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,590
Goodbye, Max.

1445
01:53:17,358 --> 01:53:19,861
