00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
subbed by Aramis

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,000
You're not here, but the flowers still bloom.
2002.5.7

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,001
Because I miss you, because I miss you so much.
Because I cannot stand it. 2003.4.5

4
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:30,653
Merry Christmas
2003.12.24

5
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:44,000
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Is it really goodbye...?  2004.3.25

6
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,948
2000, Choong-chun

7
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,244
I got here fine.
Right now?

8
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:49,282
I'm sightseeing.

9
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:50,859
I should have gone with you.

10
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:53,305
How's the boarding house?

11
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,383
Good.

12
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:59,167
Are you done unpacking?

13
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:22,766
I'm really fine.

14
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,710
Hey!

15
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,334
Kang Wook, run!

16
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,883
Get them!

17
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:59,284
My bag?

18
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,739
I'm leaving.

19
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:25,971
Drive safely.

20
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:30,131
Don't forget your medicine.

21
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,298
I know.

22
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:35,397
I think we found a good place for you.
And the grandmother here is really nice.

23
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:36,398
Right?

24
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,150
If something happens, call me immediately.
I'll come as soon as possible.

25
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:40,151
Okay.

26
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,502
I'm leaving.

27
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,606
Drive safely.

28
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:44,424
All right.

29
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:47,451
Bye.

30
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,096
Be safe.

31
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,315
Call me.

32
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:10,116
Kang Wook, you were hella cool today.

33
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:12,845
Here.

34
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:21,159
Those Dong Gang High kids are probably
all pissed off right now.

35
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:29,579
Stop acting so cool, man.

36
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,515
What's this?

37
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:36,401
At the student store.
While buying mine.

38
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,191
Thanks.

39
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,018
Hey Jung Ho Tae.

40
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:47,408
Step outside for a moment.

41
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,534
Hey, is Yoon Ja Kyung's mouth the
only one?

42
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,189
I like sandwiches, too.

43
00:06:58,347 --> 00:06:59,250
Step aside.

44
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,398
Jung Ho Tae.

45
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,990
I'm sorry each time, but...

46
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,703
Lend me some money.

47
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:09,132
I don't have any.

48
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:11,894
Don't have any?

49
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,081
Yeah, I don't have any.

50
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,025
You always say you don't have any
when you're going to give me some anyway.

51
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,370
You said it was the last time
before.

52
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:22,574
I did? I said that?

53
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,057
I can't remember.

54
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:26,079
Do you have amnesia?

55
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,768
Hey. When are you going to give it to me?

56
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,665
Tomorrow?

57
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,190
Hey asshole.

58
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,778
Don't you have change from the
sandwiches, asshole?

59
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:45,154
Even if I had some, I wouldn't
give it to you!

60
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:46,387
What?

61
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:52,294
Man, why do you make me,
at our gentlemanly school,

62
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:57,371
use my fist!

63
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,585
Search him.

64
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:02,496
Stand up.

65
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,321
You have a lot of money!

66
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,644
Why are you lying?

67
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,202
What the hell are you looking at?

68
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,827
Tell me you're sorry.

69
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:04,031
Come down. Bell's gonna ring.

70
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:06,944
All right.

71
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:12,794
We get a new homeroom teacher today.
I don't want her hating you, so come down.

72
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:17,864
If she doesn't hate me, do I get
something in return?

73
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,605
Hurry and come, okay?

74
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:23,767
And stop acting so cool.

75
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,154
Me?

76
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,488
It will be difficult, but I ask of you.

77
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,627
How could I as soon as I get here...

78
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:38,092
A month from now is winter vacation.

79
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,228
Just until then.

80
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,523
A warning: there are a few widely known
troublemakers in that class.

81
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,292
Teacher's coming!

82
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,875
Who's the class rep here?

83
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:10,469
Straighten. Bow.
Good morning.

84
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,918
Hello. Nice to meet you.

85
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,672
My name is Lee Yool Joo.

86
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:19,644
I'm the homeroom teacher while your
regular teacher is away sick.

87
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,434
I hope we get along.

88
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:22,952
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:39,008
Oh, sit down.

90
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:51,455
Hello.

91
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:53,927
Yeah, nice to meet you.

92
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:56,614
I'm really glad to see you.

93
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:01,354
Your kicks were awesome yesterday.

94
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,352
You guys were good at fighting, too.

95
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,592
First time hearing praise from a teacher.

96
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:18,859
Oh. Wait.

97
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:21,903
Lift your face.

98
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:37,131
Did you guys hit him?

99
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,563
No, we didn't.

100
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:44,419
Did they hit you?

101
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,483
No.

102
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,719
He said he wasn't hit.

103
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:50,981
Quiet.

104
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:56,845
Tell me the truth. Did they hit
you or not?

105
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,097
They didn't hit me.

106
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,480
Are you laughing?

107
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,161
Why are you laughing?

108
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:17,237
There's air in my stomached!

109
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,467
Again?

110
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:23,435
Stop it.

111
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,551
You're shocking the teacher.

112
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:28,074
Shall we, then?

113
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:34,532
Why did you hit him?

114
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:40,463
Teacher, I wasn't hit by Kang Wook.

115
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:42,971
So you threatened him, too.

116
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,404
Why did you hit him?

117
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:47,213
I didn't.

118
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:49,853
Does his face look fine to you?

119
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:51,866
I told you, I didn't.

120
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,094
I should've known when I saw you
fighting in the streets yesterday.

121
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:01,232
All of you, stand in the hallway.

122
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:03,006
Right now.

123
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,562
You go too.

124
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:23,397
Not being able to say you were hit,
that is a fault as well.

125
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,497
Go out.

126
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:44,327
All right, this is my first time, so
shall we do introductions?

127
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,261
Who wants to start?

128
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:53,702
She has a killer body.

129
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,979
Big breasts and all.

130
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:58,778
Maybe she stuffs.

131
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:08,538
Why the hell are you crying?

132
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:11,358
Next.

133
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:15,919
I'm Yoon Ja Kyung.

134
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,188
Is that all?

135
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,118
Yes.

136
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,987
Then can I ask you a question?

137
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:33,457
What's the one word you always
keep in your heart?

138
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,587
Can we just start class?

139
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,237
Our finals are coming soon.

140
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,576
This is part of class.

141
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:48,889
Talking to a complete stranger, and...
getting to know me.

142
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,837
Hey, you'd better stop.

143
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,266
Hey, stop.

144
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,057
Stop it.

145
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,779
He keeps crying

146
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:08,490
Why are you crying?

147
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,617
You've never been punished before, right?

148
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,379
Because I'm embarrassed, asshole.

149
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,356
Are you acting?

150
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,982
This is kinda cute.

151
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,356
Why are you so embarrassed?

152
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,078
I'm different from you guys.

153
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:29,873
I really hate you.

154
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,387
I really hate being treated the same as you.

155
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,926
I really hate you.

156
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:41,131
What are we like?

157
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:43,706
What are we like!

158
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:47,488
You're bad guys.

159
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:49,843
Human trash.

160
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,183
Parasites.

161
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,184
Cockroaches.

162
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,267
Why are you hitting me!

163
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,046
What are you doing?

164
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:06,038
You stay here, everyone go back inside.

165
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,650
You don't have your nametag.

166
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:19,713
What’s your name?

167
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:22,151
What’s your name!

168
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:23,874
Suh Kang Wook.

169
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:26,181
Don’t I look like a teacher to you?

170
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,385
Nope.

171
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,032
What?

172
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:34,447
Suh Kang Wook!

173
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:36,426
Stop right there!

174
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,585
Gold medal winner of the Kang Won University
watercolor painting competition

175
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,089
Teacher Lee Yool Joo?

176
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:53,125
Yes?

177
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,561
Good job.

178
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:59,071
Your voice could be heard from next door.
Made me feel good inside.

179
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:03,373
Those guys will never go to college,
so take things a little easy.

180
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,171
Since you did that from the start,
they won't start any big trouble any time soon.

181
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:17,003
Teacher, why did Suh Kang Wook
miss a year of school?

182
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:21,927
Skipped without a reason.
He actually is not that dumb...

183
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,706
Then again, fighting requires smarts, too.

184
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:30,910
Father was a college professor.
Died of an unknown reason, or something.

185
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,077
He’s always trying to
act so cool.

186
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:42,998
Sometimes rough in action. Had mental trouble
due to father's questionable death.

187
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:58,215
I had quite a welcoming party, didn't I?

188
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,549
I called you here because

189
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,479
I want to know about Suh Kang Wook.

190
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,347
You made a mistake.

191
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:17,603
What?

192
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,622
Kang Wook did not hit Ho Tae
In the morning.

193
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,088
He was late coming from the roof.

194
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:26,385
I saw him.

195
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,864
Why did you say something?

196
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:34,185
Kang Wook doesn't like for me to meddle.

197
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:39,773
He wouldn't like me saying this to
you either, but

198
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:45,591
I hope you won't look at him differently
because he was held back a grade.

199
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,855
You met him yesterday, right?

200
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:55,392
I’m saying this because that seems to
be influencing your thoughts about him.

201
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,457
I didn't. I said I didn't.

202
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,652
I don't look like a teacher to you?

203
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:51,661
Nope.

204
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:52,666
What?

205
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:59,741
Suh Kang Wook!
Stop right there!

206
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:19,253
I was drinking well that day. And that
man came and said he would pay my tab.

207
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:22,055
Said let's have a cup of coffee together.

208
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:26,623
Because of that damned cup of coffee.

209
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:32,870
I was so drunk, I don't remember anything.

210
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:44,260
How could a guy who raped me while I was drunk
not have 10,000 dollars and then sue me back?

211
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:50,691
Mr. Prosecutor, I'm really guiltless here.

212
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,399
I think 5000 could solve things.

213
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,684
Was it room 506 or 507?

214
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:05,809
507.

215
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,236
Oh it's written here. Sam Jung motel
room 507.

216
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,914
It’s Sam ho motel.

217
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,627
Ah, Sam ho.

218
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,052
You said you were so drunk you
didn't know what was going on, right?

219
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:21,485
Yes.

220
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,228
How do you remember the motel
name and room number so well?

221
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:32,654
Did you think we'd pity you if you
said you were the victim?

222
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:42,667
November 28, 2 am, you met the guy
and had consensual sex in room 507.

223
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,666
Next morning, you sued him for
10000 dollars!

224
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:50,921
He sues you back for fraud.

225
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:55,763
You acknowledge this, right?

226
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:06,898
Weak to pressure, and shows no signs
of feeling remorse.

227
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,407
Take her away!

228
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,141
Hello

229
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,482
Welcome

230
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:20,253
It’s done?

231
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:21,685
Yes, please wait a moment

232
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:32,179
I’m home.

233
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:36,565
You worthless jerk!
Where did you sleep last night!

234
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:41,485
This thing is really tough.
How many times was that?

235
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:42,795
Wash up and come in!

236
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:43,542
Yes, ma'am!

237
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:09,108
Hello

238
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:12,239
Grandmother!

239
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:14,300
Grandmother!

240
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:23,791
Suh Kang Wook!

241
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:25,494
What are you doing here?

242
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,083
What are YOU doing here?

243
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,276
This is my house.

244
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:30,729
Is this a teacher visit?

245
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,055
This is your house?

246
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,521
What are you two doing here?

247
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,235
Grandmother, the grandson who goes
to my school is him?

248
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,079
I couldn't introduce you since he
didn't come home last night.

249
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:46,847
Say hello.

250
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,140
She’s boarding at our house.

251
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:55,257
Have you two met?

252
00:23:55,712 --> 00:24:00,234
I’m Kang Wook's homeroom teacher.

253
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:03,342
Really? Is that how it is?

254
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:08,261
This is kinda weird.

255
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:20,210
Why is that crazy bitch smiling?

256
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:26,749
The shameless bitch that made her son
an orphan when her husband died!

257
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:30,062
And on the very same day he died!

258
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:41,105
My poor son who didn't know why he was
dying before the age of 50.

259
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:45,778
This is all because she came into the house.

260
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:51,611
I told him she would end up eating him up.

261
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:56,840
She deserves to die twice!

262
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:59,746
Deserves to die!

263
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:05,771
Though they say you live the way
you look

264
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,713
What a poor and pathetic life

265
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:34,899
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

266
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,578
Kang Wook! Kang Wook, don't go!
Kang Wook!

267
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:48,112
Mom!

268
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:55,870
Mom, mom! Please get up!

269
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:57,758
They must be your parents.

270
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:01,751
Your door was open.

271
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,656
Your mother was a beauty.

272
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:08,502
Who's that cute boy? Let me see!

273
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:14,784
Do you need something?

274
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,525
You want to get some air?

275
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,743
Why?

276
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:26,119
I heard you didn't go to you classes today!

277
00:26:26,822 --> 00:26:27,713
So?

278
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:30,963
I’m asking why.

279
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,550
Because I didn't want to.

280
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:42,654
I think I misunderstood you in the morning.

281
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:46,607
You should have told me you didn't hit him.

282
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,025
I did.

283
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,446
Oh right, you did.

284
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,575
Is this sandbag yours?

285
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:57,798
No.

286
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,711
Then?

287
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:01,298
It was my father's.

288
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:31,435
Why did you bring this? I’m going
to leave it there tomorrow anyway.

289
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:33,126
I was bored.

290
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,383
Did the ceremony go well?

291
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:36,249
Yeah

292
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:42,869
Where are you going?

293
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:44,309
I’ll take you home

294
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,684
What are you doing here? Without
even calling me?

295
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:06,881
I suddenly wanted to see you.

296
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:12,449
Is it okay to stay here?
Looks shabby.

297
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,321
No, it's good.

298
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:17,021
You lost weight.

299
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:19,905
Liar.

300
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:21,102
That’s what I’m saying.

301
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:25,580
I had a hard first day today.

302
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:33,339
Your mom's not home?

303
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:36,036
She went to Seoul to see my father.

304
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,423
It’s a weekly routine.

305
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:44,902
She was leaving, all dressed up,
when this thought occurred to me

306
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:50,338
Is she going to bust my dad,
the married man?

307
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:56,509
Why are you looking at me like that?

308
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,141
Because you're pretty.

309
00:28:58,163 --> 00:28:58,985
What?

310
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:01,888
You don't know why you're pretty, right?

311
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,894
Go in.

312
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,929
You’re not going to tell me?

313
00:29:08,305 --> 00:29:09,330
Later.

314
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,420
Kang Wook

315
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:16,342
Let’s go to college together.

316
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,857
If you want I can help you

317
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:23,698
In the past, you got better grades
than I did

318
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:26,737
Yoon Ja Kyung

319
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:30,504
It’s good that you're pretty.
But don't overdo it.

320
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:32,529
I’m leaving.

321
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,448
I made a mistake, right?

322
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,253
But they were the kids fighting
in the street yesterday

323
00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:50,447
How he could just walk out when his teacher,
homeroom teacher, said she wants to talk?

324
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:54,472
Stop talking about him

325
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,456
Why do you keep talking about him?

326
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,519
Don’t talk about other guys in front of me.

327
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:03,545
He’s not a guy, he's a student.

328
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:05,209
He’s a male student.

329
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:10,433
Hey Yool Joo.

330
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:11,560
Huh?

331
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,391
Give me your hand.

332
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:21,251
Pretty, huh?

333
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,632
Is it too big?

334
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:28,680
It’s big.

335
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:30,636
It’s okay, I’ll just wear it.

336
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:32,005
I’ll rematch it and get it to you.

337
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,823
That’s fine. I’ll just wear it.

338
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:39,298
I set the date for Saturday.

339
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:41,789
What date?

340
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:43,114
Dinner with both our parents.

341
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,964
I talked to your mother yesterday.

342
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,750
Tae Hyun. How could you decide
that on your own.

343
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:54,538
You’re gonna be up for the weekend
anyway. And you already met my parents.

344
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:57,059
Still. You should have discussed
it with me first.

345
00:30:57,104 --> 00:31:01,635
I tried. But you kept hanging up on me
because you had class.

346
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:06,259
I can't that day. I’m on duty.

347
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:07,662
Change it.

348
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:13,115
Yool Joo, do you really have to come
here to be a teacher?

349
00:31:13,158 --> 00:31:15,088
We already discussed this.

350
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:17,926
You can always teach after marriage.
I’m just scared you'll faint -

351
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:18,763
I’m fine.

352
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:19,887
I’m not fine. I’m worried.

353
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:30,174
Mr. Prosecutor Kim Tae Hyun, I really
hate it when you treat me like a patient.

354
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:31,987
I hate it.

355
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:35,520
You are a patient.

356
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:48,565
Hey Yool Joo!

357
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,694
Lee Yool Joo!

358
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:54,637
What’s wrong?

359
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:56,305
I told you I’m not a patient.

360
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:57,479
That's what you think!

361
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,920
I understand how you feel, but you're
still a patient to me.

362
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:55,297
Teacher! Teacher!

363
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:43,626
Please leave a message after the-

364
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:53,276
Yool Joo, it's me.
About earlier...

365
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:23,584
Are you okay?

366
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:44,263
Are you really okay?

367
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:45,255
Yup.

368
00:34:46,622 --> 00:34:49,742
I do this once in a while.
When I’m under stress.

369
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,135
I’m weird, huh?

370
00:34:55,551 --> 00:35:00,551
Kang Wook, if this ever
happens again

371
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:07,861
Will you just watch me silently
from by my side?

372
00:35:10,537 --> 00:35:11,908
Don’t faint in front of me.

373
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:14,925
You were really heavy.

374
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:20,277
Suh Kang Wook!

375
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:28,812
I’m sorry about earlier.
I’ll apologize.

376
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:31,507
I made a mistake.

377
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:33,111
I’m sorry.

378
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:35,137
Here.

379
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:40,504
I said I’m sorry.

380
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:44,294
You do what you want.

381
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,150
You misunderstand on your own,
apologize on your own.

382
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:49,428
Let’s go.

383
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:01,475
How can I send my kid to school? This is
not the first time. What are you doing?

384
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:05,308
I’m really sorry.

385
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:08,327
Hey, bastards, tell her you're sorry.

386
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:10,660
We’re sorry.

387
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,059
What the hell!

388
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:19,781
What the hell are you looking at?

389
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:21,789
Good morning.

390
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,268
Good morning.

391
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:26,045
I’m not doing so well.

392
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:32,355
Didn’t I tell you I would report you to the
board of education if this happened again?

393
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,535
I’m really sorry.

394
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:39,923
Kick these kids out. I will not
let it slide this time.

395
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:41,325
Beg for forgiveness!

396
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:43,766
I don't want it! Kick them out at once!

397
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:50,233
Hello, mother. I am Ho Tae's homeroom
teacher, Lee Yool Joo.

398
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:52,003
So?

399
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:55,673
There was an unfortunate event in our
class yesterday

400
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:59,348
But I already punished them, and
I’ll keep an eye out in the future.

401
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:02,890
Look here. I have something to
say to you as well.

402
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:06,054
Why do you punish the kid who
got hit as well?

403
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:07,747
Are you really a teacher?

404
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:11,300
Mother, my name is Lee Yool Joo, not "you."

405
00:37:11,425 --> 00:37:14,308
And Ho Tae didn't speak the truth-

406
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,889
Are you protecting the bullies here?

407
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,221
I’m not protecting anyone here,
I just -

408
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:21,238
Teacher Lee, that's enough

409
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:25,818
This happened in my class. Let me
take care of it, please.

410
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:28,204
Taking care of it would be
kicking these kids out.

411
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:31,395
Parents have no say in who gets
kicked out of school!

412
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:32,703
Stop this at once!

413
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,774
This is not something you can
handle.

414
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:39,969
Ho Tae's mother, if something happens
to the student, I, the homeroom teacher-

415
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:42,244
The homeroom teacher

416
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:45,308
The homeroom teacher

417
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:49,513
You should have discussed this
with me

418
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:52,564
I said, this is not something you
can handle

419
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:54,206
Go back to your seat

420
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:22,539
Hello?

421
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:25,637
Mom

422
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:27,984
Have you been well?

423
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,316
Yeah

424
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:31,812
And you?

425
00:39:31,854 --> 00:39:35,659
I’m good, of course. How’s the
school? Is it hard?

426
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:36,886
It’s good.

427
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:44,190
Nothing big happened, right?
Good, thank goodness.

428
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:48,775
I’m having tea with Tae Hyun's
mother right now.

429
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:50,011
Wait a moment.

430
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:53,909
Yool Joo?

431
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:57,037
It must have been hard to move
by yourself.

432
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,741
Tae Hyun didn't go, did he?

433
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:00,937
He went yesterday?

434
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:04,600
Oh, he did.

435
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:11,366
You guys, if one person messes up, all
of you do mass cleaning, understand?

436
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:12,470
Yes

437
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:14,940
And you, too!

438
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:23,042
What did we do wrong to have to
clean this huge school?

439
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,449
They say meeting a good teacher
is one of the five blessings.

440
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,100
Let’s hurry

441
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,940
Why doesn't she have to clean?

442
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,484
Did they let her off because she's pretty?

443
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:48,172
I’m so sorry, teacher!

444
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:52,270
My hands are slippery and I dropped the
Trashcan.

445
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:54,987
Think of it as your initiation rite!

446
00:40:57,273 --> 00:41:00,958
It’s okay. But you should be more
careful. What is this?

447
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:20,388
Thanks

448
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:28,249
Oh my, teacher!

449
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:31,946
Did something happen?

450
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:35,627
The kids dropped the trashcan
while cleaning.

451
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:37,006
I smell, don't I?

452
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:40,483
Take a shower at the gym

453
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,261
Oh, can I?

454
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:43,958
Thank you

455
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:01,813
Think of it as your initiation rite!

456
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:14,075
I told you to stop. This is not something
you can handle!

457
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,133
Are you really a teacher?

458
00:43:05,008 --> 00:43:11,490
(singing a Kim Hyun Jung song)

459
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:44,382
There’s no life without faults, but when you
age you'll realize, it's all the same.

460
00:43:51,618 --> 00:43:52,837
Grandma, I’m home

461
00:43:52,871 --> 00:43:55,371
You worthless kid, why are you
always so late?

462
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:56,414
Did you eat?

463
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:57,630
Of course I ate.

464
00:43:57,662 --> 00:43:59,810
What is there to eat outside!

465
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:02,446
Eat at home when it's time!

466
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:04,059
And the teacher?

467
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:06,845
She’s not home yet?

468
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:09,214
Why didn't you come home together?

469
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:12,585
I don't travel with girls.

470
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:14,719
Crazy bastard

471
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,372
Baby, want me to steam you
some yams?

472
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:19,354
I’m fine.

473
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:25,531
Grandma, go to bed. You said
you can't even see.

474
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:28,044
Are you worrying about me?

475
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:33,226
Grandma, I’ll get you some
glasses in the future.

476
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,047
And a gold bracelet?

477
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,653
Of course.

478
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:20,288
Thank you

479
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:51,221
Oh, Kang Wook?

480
00:47:52,528 --> 00:47:56,493
Oh, right, right.
Thanks for earlier.

481
00:47:57,078 --> 00:47:59,092
Wear it. It’s snowing hard.

482
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:06,305
I like that it's snowing hard, but why
on such an embarrassing day?

483
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,037
Why are you laughing?

484
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,476
Do I look funny to you?

485
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:17,294
Don’t laugh. No matter what, I’m
still your teacher.

486
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,549
I smell, don't I?

487
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:27,399
Yes.

488
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:30,511
I didn't wash my hair. Does it stink?

489
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,688
Yes.

490
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:38,436
Cotton candy.

491
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,701
You smell like cotton candy.

492
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:52,724
Kang Wook, teacher drank because

493
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,127
I felt a little stuffy in the chest

494
00:48:57,178 --> 00:49:05,301
I didn't eat all day but my stomach
was hurting like indigestion.

495
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,561
I don't think I deserve to be a teacher

496
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,752
As soon as I came, I misunderstood you

497
00:49:12,702 --> 00:49:19,147
I got yelled at by the principal,
and the kids are ostracizing me

498
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:24,654
Do you know what my dream was?

499
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:28,992
What was it?

500
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,820
A super good teacher

501
00:49:34,268 --> 00:49:36,152
Do you know what my dream
during school was?

502
00:49:37,689 --> 00:49:41,213
An ultra, jjang, awesome
super good teacher

503
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,017
Know what my dream is now?

504
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,275
Being the first love of you dream-filled guys

505
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:52,757
First love, and super good teacher

506
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:59,073
I really wanted to be a super good teacher

507
00:50:00,437 --> 00:50:01,422
I’m so sad

508
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:06,658
It’s too early to be depressed.
It hasn't even been long since you came.

509
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:13,487
Want to go settle your stomach?

510
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:09,017
Now I feel like everything's off my chest!

511
00:51:48,282 --> 00:51:49,091
I’m home.

512
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:50,215
You’re late.

513
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:50,887
Yes.

514
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:52,887
Father, I’m home.

515
00:51:52,928 --> 00:51:57,880
This isn't late. When I was a young
prosecutor, I stayed up whole nights.

516
00:51:58,776 --> 00:51:59,893
You didn't drink?

517
00:52:00,594 --> 00:52:02,509
Wasn’t there a meeting today?

518
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,307
I didn't go

519
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:05,191
Why?

520
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:06,927
I was too tired

521
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,911
To an prosecutor, information
is as important as good judgment

522
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:13,061
Don’t keep missing those

523
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:14,428
Yes, father

524
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:17,090
I spoke to Yool Joo today

525
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,217
I heard you went to Choong-chun yesterday

526
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:21,464
Yes

527
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,135
I think she's having fun at school

528
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:29,801
Mom, about meeting Yool Joo's parents
tomorrow?

529
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:31,902
I think we have to push that back
a few days.

530
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,527
Why?

531
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:36,146
Something came up for me.

532
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:40,149
What? Something important?

533
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:42,042
Yes, something I can't postpone,
Father.

534
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:45,188
I think Yool Joo's father had to
squeeze us in his schedule

535
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:46,659
I feel bad

536
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:47,888
I’ll explain things to him

537
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:53,955
Yesterday, quite a lot of things
happened in our class

538
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:04,153
Class rep?

539
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:04,768
Yes?

540
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:07,050
Let's have a get-together

541
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:10,400
Discuss amongst yourselves how, when,
and where we're going to have fun

542
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:11,505
Okay

543
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:13,269
And Jo Young Hwa?

544
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:14,248
Why?

545
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:17,859
Young Hwa, you don't have to clean
the hallways in the future

546
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,130
Okay!

547
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,505
Instead, clean the bathroom

548
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:26,603
The end

549
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:31,488
Straight, bow.
Thank you

550
00:53:50,108 --> 00:53:50,811
What is it?

551
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:53,177
Um, you see

552
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:55,894
Read this

553
00:53:57,782 --> 00:53:59,112
I don't have time to read

554
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,874
It’s good information. It’ll help you

555
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:03,625
You called me out to give me this?

556
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,012
Thanks, but no thanks

557
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,073
Ja Kyung!

558
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:11,043
I fought with Suh Kang Wook.

559
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:15,510
I feel really good about that

560
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:19,429
Though I became a mama's boy
because of my mom

561
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:21,078
But I’m still glad

562
00:54:21,379 --> 00:54:22,830
That I fought Suh Kang Wook

563
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,647
Why do you feel so good about that?

564
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:30,263
Because I like you

565
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:34,594
I know. He doesn't like you as much
as I do

566
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,085
The person who really likes you
is me

567
00:54:39,163 --> 00:54:41,017
You liking me is your feelings

568
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:43,188
And I have my own feelings

569
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:46,584
And Kang Wook's feelings are his own

570
00:54:47,738 --> 00:54:48,493
Understand?

571
00:55:02,314 --> 00:55:03,574
Hey, class rep, we're going first.

572
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,502
Suh Kang Wook

573
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:13,446
I need to talk to you

574
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:14,649
Why?

575
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:17,152
Who are you to tell him
to come or go

576
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:21,133
I hear the broadcasting club is going
out to eat, why don't you just go there?

577
00:55:21,638 --> 00:55:22,592
Go on ahead

578
00:55:22,624 --> 00:55:26,373
Bastard, it's no fun if you're
not there

579
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:31,390
What’s up with her?

580
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:32,883
How annoying

581
00:55:33,117 --> 00:55:34,152
Does being class rep make you all that?

582
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,065
What is it?

583
00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:40,041
You. Play with me today

584
00:55:40,082 --> 00:55:41,277
What?

585
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:42,813
Play with me today.

586
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:47,365
How do you want to play?

587
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,959
Like them.

588
00:56:26,677 --> 00:56:27,947
Let’s eat at a really nice place today

589
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,123
It’s Ja Kyung!

590
00:56:56,242 --> 00:56:57,642
And Kang Wook is here too!

591
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:04,478
Oh my, that dance is awesome

592
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:36,443
I changed the date. You can
choose it.

593
00:57:37,172 --> 00:57:38,995
Okay. Thanks.

594
00:57:46,638 --> 00:57:48,858
I’m a patient.

595
00:57:48,995 --> 00:57:53,042
Hey, Yool Joo, how about telling
the school about your narcolepsy?

596
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:55,391
You could fall asleep at school.

597
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,938
I’ll see. Later.

598
00:58:05,058 --> 00:58:06,226
Thank you

599
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:08,075
Eat well

600
00:58:13,906 --> 00:58:14,697
Where’s the ring?

601
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:15,907
Huh?

602
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:19,613
Did you take it off when you were mad?

603
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:22,629
That’s not it.

604
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:23,840
Did you lose it?

605
00:58:23,884 --> 00:58:28,334
No, it's at home. I took it off
to wash up.

606
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:32,292
Eat a lot.

607
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:57,866
What are you doing?

608
00:58:59,693 --> 00:59:00,476
How shocking!

609
00:59:01,756 --> 00:59:02,511
Are you just coming home?

610
00:59:03,902 --> 00:59:04,819
Are you looking for something?

611
00:59:05,884 --> 00:59:07,509
A ring

612
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:09,296
A ring...

613
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:18,495
Suh Kang Wook, even if you really
like your girlfriend, don't stay out so late

614
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:27,347
You can always date later.
You’re a student now.

615
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:29,265
Teacher

616
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,119
But it's a little big

617
01:00:09,757 --> 01:00:13,371
Hey bastard, how is it that there
isn't a day when you don't come to see me?

618
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,381
Why do you come to school?

619
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:19,273
Why do you come?

620
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:23,583
Kang Wook has no fault.
I made him go.

621
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:28,613
It’s bad enough you and your friends go,
now you take an innocent girl to a club as well?

622
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,240
Do you want to be held back
another year?

623
01:00:32,393 --> 01:00:34,057
Does your grandmother know
you act like this?

624
01:00:36,396 --> 01:00:42,073
If you don't want to hear stuff about being
an orphan, you should do even better

625
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,241
Am I right?

626
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,128
Who are you to glare at me?
Did I say something wrong?

627
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,912
So your father died a mysterious
death?

628
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:56,459
It’s a mystery to me how you’re
going to turn out, you know that?

629
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:01,425
You bastard. Loosen your
glare!

630
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,339
You bastard! Loosen it!

631
01:01:09,338 --> 01:01:12,001
Are you insane?
Let go!

632
01:01:15,836 --> 01:01:18,208
Bastard! How dare you!
To your teacher! Bastard!

633
01:01:43,543 --> 01:01:45,096
Kang Wook! Stop there!

634
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:26,428
Kang Wook. Stop.

635
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,808
Don’t go. You mustn't go.

636
01:02:31,462 --> 01:02:33,827
Kang Wook! Don’t go! You mustn't go!

637
01:02:40,727 --> 01:02:42,085
If you go, you lose.

638
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:44,211
Don’t go.

639
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,801
Don’t go.

640
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:50,181
Kang Wook, you have me.

641
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:54,089
You have me, your homeroom teacher.

642
01:02:55,847 --> 01:02:57,052
Go back with me

643
01:02:58,305 --> 01:02:58,856
Here

644
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,257
Let’s go back together

645
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:05,424
Here, hurry

646
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:45,837
