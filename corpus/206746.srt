1
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
Alex.

2
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,100
Tod and George's dad
just called.

3
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,900
He's picking you up
at 3.30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
The bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.00.

5
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,800
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

6
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,900
Mom, you got
to leave that on.

7
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,300
The tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing...

8
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,700
so I figure it's got to be
on or with the bag.

9
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,900
For luck.

10
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

11
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm still here.

12
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,300
So, seventeen, on the loose...

13
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,700
senior trip
with your friends in Paris...

14
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
ten days in the springtime.

15
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,600
Live it up. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

16
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,400
Hitchcock, let me give you
a hand with this.

17
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
There you go.

18
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Carter, you dick.

19
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
-Schmuck.
-Good one.

20
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,100
-You left this on the bus.
-Thanks.

21
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Come on,
let's get your stuff together.

22
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,700
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

23
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,600
-What are you doing?
-He's the man.

24
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,400
All right.
You guys got everything?

25
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Yeah, Dad, we're all set.

26
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Does that mean go?

27
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Don't know.

28
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.

29
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,000
Thanks, Dad.

30
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,600
-Both of us.
-Let's go.

31
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,500
-Alex, take care of them.
-I will.

32
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,500
Didn't think anything could look
worse than my yearbook photo.

33
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,500
How do you think I feel
having to look at you?

34
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,300
What the fuck does he want?

35
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
The airport does not
endorse solicitors.

36
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Death is not the end.

37
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,800
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

38
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Hare Rama.

39
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,500
I have to ask you
a few questions this evening.

40
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,200
Did you pack your bags yourself?

41
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,000
Have your belongings been in
your possession the entire time?

42
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,500
Mr Browning?

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

44
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,300
-Same as your birthday.
-What?

45
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,300
September 25. 9.25.

46
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,800
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

47
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,200
Fuck off, dude. Dick.

48
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Babe.

49
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,400
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.

50
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,900
Knock it off.

51
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,200
You asshole.

52
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

53
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,700
Let's go take a shit.

54
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,500
-Take a shit by yourself.
-No, dude.

55
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Listen, OK?
Take some knowledge.

56
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

57
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,200
The toilets in coach
are barely ventilated closets.

58
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,200
Say halfway
through the flight...

59
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,000
your body wants
that aeroplane food out.

60
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
You got to go
torque a wicked cable.

61
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Then directly after you,
walks in Christa or Blake.

62
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

63
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

64
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,700
He was born

65
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,500
In the summer

66
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,600
Of his 27th year

67
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,000
Comin' home

68
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,800
John Denver.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,500
He left yesterday behind him

70
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,900
Died in a plane crash.

71
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

72
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,400
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

73
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,500
of Volee Air flight 180
to Paris through gate 46.

74
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,100
I've seen it raining fire

75
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,900
In the sky

76
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?

77
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,700
Go. Go.

78
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Go.

79
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,700
That hurt.

80
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,700
That's a good sign.
Younger, the better.

81
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,700
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

82
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
A really fucked-up God.

83
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
-Hey, Tod.
-Hello. How you doing?

84
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Can you switch seats
with Christa?

85
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,700
God, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

86
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,900
It's a urinary tract infection.

87
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Let's go ask Alex.

88
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Could you trade seats so Blake
and I could sit together?

89
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,500
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

90
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Please?

91
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
You're so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.

92
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,600
Thank you, Alex.

93
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,900
You're welcome.

94
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,300
You really think we'd
titty-fuck them over Greenland?

95
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,700
Because of you, I got to watch
fucking "Stuart Little."

96
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,300
Thank you.

97
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,700
Thanks, man. That's great.

98
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,700
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
That's my seat right there.

100
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Thanks.

101
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,500
-Hello?
-Ain't going that way.

102
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,400
May I have your attention?

103
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,600
To properly fasten
your seat belts...

104
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
slide the flat portion
into the buckle.

105
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,500
There are six emergency exits.

106
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
Two doors in front,
two over the wings...

107
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
two at the rear
of the aircraft.

108
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,700
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

109
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,700
All right.

110
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,500
Whatever.

111
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,900
It's fine.

112
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,700
It's OK, honey.

113
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,500
Could you trade seats so
Blake and I could sit together?

114
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,700
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

115
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,300
Please?

116
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,100
What's up, dude?

117
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,100
-Is there a problem, sir?
-What's your fucking problem?

118
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,300
This fucking plane's
going to explode!

119
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,500
-Shut up, Browning.
-You're so not funny.

120
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,600
-If this is a joke...
-It's not a joke!

121
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Alex, take it easy.

122
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,300
-Sit down!
-It's going down!

123
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,800
We'll remove you
if this continues.

124
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,600
I'll fucking remove myself!

125
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,700
-That's my seat.
-This plane is going down!

126
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,900
Everybody in the aisle
off the plane.

127
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,800
Just stay where you are.
Sit tight.

128
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
This fucking plane
is going down!

129
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,400
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

130
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,100
-Get the fuck off me!
-Let go, jerk.

131
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,400
You got this?
No one gets back on board.

132
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
-That's my call.
-Wait, please!

133
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,000
I've got forty students
going to Paris. Please.

134
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,600
You must understand
my position.

135
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
I do, and I apologize
for Alex...

136
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,700
but one of us
needs to be on that plane.

137
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,100
I cannot let those students
go to Paris for ten days...

138
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,900
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
Sit!

139
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,900
One of you
can go on the flight.

140
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,200
Larry.

141
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,400
They're not taking this well.
One of us can get back on.

142
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,100
The rest can take
an 11.10 flight.

143
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,400
I'll stay.

144
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
You know the French thing.
Get on the plane.

145
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
It's fine.

146
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Hi, I was in the bathroom,
and the lock was stuck...

147
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
Wait, I didn't fight
with anyone!

148
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,300
Damn!

149
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
Thanks.

150
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
I called your parents.
They're on their way.

151
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
Stupid Alex.

152
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,500
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

153
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
I saw it.

154
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,300
I don't know. I saw it.

155
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,500
I saw it on the runway,
I saw it take off...

156
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
I saw out my window,
I saw the ground.

157
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,300
And the cabin,
it starts to shake.

158
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,900
The left side blows up
and the whole plane explodes.

159
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,400
And it was so real,
like how everything happens.

160
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,300
Been on a lot of planes
that blew up?

161
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
You fell asleep.

162
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,900
We get thrown off the plane
and blow a half day in Paris?

163
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,900
All because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

164
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,700
Wait! The plane,
it's going to blow up!

165
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,800
Fuck you, Horton.

166
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,500
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital!

167
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,700
Get off him !
Alex, stop it!

168
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,600
There they go, here we stay.

169
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,200
You're paying for my trip.

170
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I wish you were on that plane!

171
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
-You fucking prick!
-Shit!

172
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
-Call it in!
-Security!

173
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,600
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

174
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,900
I didn't cause this.

175
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,100
Are there any survivors?

176
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,400
How should I know?

177
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,700
-You think I'm some...
-He's not a witch.

178
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm Howard Seigel...

179
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,300
National Transportation
and Safety Board.

180
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,400
We've contacted
all your families.

181
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,700
They are on the way.

182
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,500
Is there anyone here
who feels they might need...

183
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,400
medical attention
or spiritual counselling?

184
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?

185
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,500
The cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

186
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,000
The Nassau County
authorities are on the scene...

187
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,100
naval search and rescue
en route.

188
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,200
Excuse me. I'm Agent Weine.

189
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
This is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBl.

190
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
I understand how
you all must be feeling...

191
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
and I know it's going
to be difficult...

192
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,200
but we need to ask questions
regarding today's events...

193
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,400
while they're still fresh
in your mind.

194
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,500
This will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts...

195
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,600
and any potential
criminal investigation.

196
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,400
You said, "Listen to me.

197
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,100
"This plane will explode
on takeoff."

198
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,900
How did you know that?

199
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
I got this feeling.

200
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,900
This weird feeling.

201
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding?

202
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,400
On board, did you take
any sleeping pills...

203
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,900
narcotics, hallucinogens?

204
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Do you take any drugs?

205
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,000
I saw it.

206
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I saw it happen.

207
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,700
I saw the plane explode.

208
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,600
Did the weird feelings
have anything to do...

209
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
with your saying you wished
Carter Horton was on it...

210
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
just before it exploded?

211
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,300
Then why'd you say it?

212
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,200
I didn't really think
it was going to happen.

213
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
If that's the case, Alex...

214
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
why did you really
get off the plane?

215
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
My brother George...

216
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
he told me to go
keep an eye on Alex.

217
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,700
And so he stayed and...

218
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,500
He told me
to get off the plane.

219
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Larry Murnau said
I should get back on...

220
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,900
but I told him
that he should go.

221
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
I sent him back on the plane.

222
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
All right.

223
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Nobody forced you off the plane.

224
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,600
You said you weren't friends
with those that were...

225
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,300
so, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

226
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,000
Because I saw
and I heard Alex...

227
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,300
and I believed him.

228
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
There he is.

229
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,500
Thank you for the ride.

230
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,900
You are looking
at the first piece of debris...

231
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,000
to wash ashore
from Volee Air flight 180...

232
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,300
which erupted shortly after
a 9.25 p.m. takeoff...

233
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.

234
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,100
There are no known survivors.

235
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,900
Coast Guard and naval
search and rescue efforts...

236
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,700
are continuing
at this moment...

237
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,900
even as jet fuel burns
on the ocean's surface.

238
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

239
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,700
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

240
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,700
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

241
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,100
Amongst the travellers...

242
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,800
a class of forty students
and four teachers...

243
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,000
from Mount Abraham High School
in south-east New York...

244
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,200
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

245
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,400
There are reports
several students...

246
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,700
were removed from the aircraft
moments before departure...

247
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,800
however, investigators
remain guarded...

248
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,800
about the specifics
of this incident.

249
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,500
Authorities from National
Transportation and Safety...

250
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,000
and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation...

251
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
have arrived at JFKto begin
the initial investigation.

252
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

253
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,000
report seeing the plane explode.

254
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,600
No other aircraft were
visibly near flight 180.

255
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,400
At JFK,
air traffic controllers...

256
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,400
are corroborating
these eyewitness accounts.

257
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,400
After the explosion,
debris apparently rained...

258
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,300
into the Atlantic Ocean
for several miles.

259
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,500
Investigators are cautious about
verifying these accounts...

260
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,900
believing they'll learn more...

261
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Thirty-nine days
have passed...

262
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
since we lost
our thirty-nine loved ones...

263
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,100
friends, and teachers.

264
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,500
As each day passes...

265
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,600
without a determining cause
for the accident...

266
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,100
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

267
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,800
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...

268
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,900
"Man no more knows
his own time...

269
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,000
"than fish taken
in the fatal net...

270
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
"or birds trapped in the snare.

271
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
"Like these,
the children of men caught...

272
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,900
"when the time falls
suddenly upon them."

273
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,300
And so,
before we can heal...

274
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,700
before we escape the presence
of death and time...

275
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,900
we must mourn
and celebrate theirs...

276
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
with this memorial.

277
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,300
I hope you don't think because
my name ain't on this wall...

278
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,900
that I owe you anything.

279
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I don't.

280
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,600
All I owe these people is
to live my life to the fullest.

281
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,900
Why don't you
stay off the J.D., then?

282
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,700
Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do.

283
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
I control my life, not you.

284
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,900
I'm never going to die.

285
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,300
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

286
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,700
Got a seventy.

287
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,700
It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

288
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,000
The thing is,
when I was done with the test...

289
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,700
you know the guy that drives
with you during the test?

290
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Anyways, he goes....

291
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,200
"Young man, you're going to die
at a very young age."

292
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,700
Is that true?

293
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

294
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,200
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

295
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,000
Fuck.

296
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,700
Don't talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.

297
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm going up.

298
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,600
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

299
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,500
I miss you, you know?

300
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, I miss you, too.

301
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,500
But my father,
he doesn't understand.

302
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,300
Look, when he gets over
this thing...

303
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,600
you and me,
we'll road trip to the city...

304
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,800
catch the Yanks.

305
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,000
We'll do that.

306
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,600
Cool.

307
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,600
I better go.

308
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,600
This thing Ms Lewton
showed me in class...

309
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
they're going to let me read it.

310
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
It says what I'm feeling.

311
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
Take care, man.

312
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,000
Because of you,
I'm still alive.

313
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,100
Thank you.

314
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,100
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

315
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,600
But when we say this...

316
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
we imagine
that the hour is placed...

317
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,300
in an obscure
and distant future.

318
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,400
It never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

319
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,400
with the day already begun...

320
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,600
or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

321
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,300
This afternoon
which is so certain...

322
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,200
and which has every hour
filled in advance.

323
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,900
What happened?

324
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
Where's Tod?

325
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,900
Get out of here.

326
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,600
-Didn't you see it?
-What happened?

327
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,300
You caused Tod
so much guilt over George...

328
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,600
he took his own life.

329
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,700
He wouldn't do that.

330
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,500
He said we'd be friends again
after you got better.

331
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,000
Why would he make plans
if he was going to kill himself?

332
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,600
Mr Waggner.

333
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,300
Almost autumn.

334
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,600
It's only the end of June.

335
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

336
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,900
If you focus, even now,
just one week into summer...

337
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
you can almost feel
autumn coming.

338
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,700
I like being able
to see the future.

339
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,700
Why were you at
Tod's house last night?

340
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,400
I've seen enough TV to know...

341
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,800
the FBl doesn't investigate
teen suicides.

342
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
They were there last night.
That means, one...

343
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
they still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

344
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,600
Two--they haven't
ruled out anything...

345
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,600
and the fact seven people
got off the plane...

346
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
is probably weird enough.

347
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,400
Not to mention, one of
those people had a vision...

348
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,700
of the plane exploding...

349
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,000
minutes before it actually did
is highly suspicious.

350
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,100
And it doesn't help that
the visionary's friend...

351
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,000
just committed suicide.

352
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,700
Why were you there last night?

353
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,500
You know what this is?

354
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,800
This is a...

355
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,800
This is Springy Head Guy.

356
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,400
It's you. Not a likeness.

357
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,900
It's how
you make me feel, Alex.

358
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,200
I'm sorry.

359
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,500
No. Like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know...

360
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,900
what or why it is.

361
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,300
It's reluctant to take form...

362
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,600
and yet creating an absolute...

363
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,800
but incomprehensible
attraction.

364
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,200
In four years
of high school...

365
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
we haven't said
one word to each other.

366
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,600
At that moment, on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

367
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,400
I didn't even know where
those emotions came from...

368
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,900
until you started
freaking out.

369
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I didn't see what you saw,
but I felt it.

370
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,300
You can still feel it,
can't you?

371
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,100
Something from that day
is still with you.

372
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,900
I know because
I can still feel you.

373
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,800
That's why I was there
last night.

374
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
I've never dealt
with death before.

375
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,800
This could all be in our head.

376
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
It just feels like
it's all around us.

377
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,500
It?

378
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,700
What if Tod was just the first?

379
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,000
Of us.

380
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,600
Is that something
that you're feeling?

381
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,300
I don't know.

382
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,000
I wish I could see him
one last time.

383
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Maybe I would know.

384
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,800
Then let's go see him.

385
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,600
Easy.

386
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,300
Gives me a rush.

387
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
This place?

388
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,000
Doing something
I'm not supposed to.

389
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,600
Come on.

390
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,400
Hurry up.

391
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,000
-Is that him?
-I think.

392
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,600
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

393
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,300
That's him.

394
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,600
Whatever it was that made him
Tod is definitely gone.

395
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,800
Holy Christ!

396
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
Please.

397
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,100
You'll wake the dead.

398
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,100
Why'd his hand do that?

399
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,500
Chemicals.

400
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,600
The vascular flush
creates cadaveric spasms.

401
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,600
Look, I'm his friend...

402
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,600
I know who you are.

403
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,700
What are all those tiny marks?

404
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,400
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

405
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,700
Pulling at the wire?

406
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,500
If he was pulling at the wire,
he didn't kill himself.

407
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,900
It was an accident.

408
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,000
In death,
there are no accidents...

409
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,100
no coincidences, no mishaps...

410
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,400
and no escapes.

411
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,500
What you have to realize
is we're all just a mouse...

412
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,500
a cat has by the tail.

413
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,400
Every single move we make...

414
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,500
from the mundane
to the monumental...

415
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,600
the red light
that we stop at or run...

416
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,700
the people we have sex with
or won't with us...

417
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,900
aeroplanes that we ride
or walk out of...

418
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,200
it's all part of
death's sadistic design...

419
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,300
leading to the grave.

420
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,600
Design.

421
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,300
Does that mean if...

422
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,600
you figure out the design,
you can cheat death?

423
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,400
Alex, you've
already done that...

424
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,500
by walking off the plane.

425
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,800
Your friend's departure...

426
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,300
shows that death has
a new design for all of you.

427
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Now you have to figure out...

428
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,000
how and when
it's coming back at you.

429
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,400
Play your hunch...

430
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,500
if you think
you can get away with it.

431
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,800
But remember...

432
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,900
the risk of cheating the plan...

433
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,300
of disrespecting the design...

434
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,700
could incite a fury to terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

435
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,400
And you don't even want to
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

436
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,400
OK, then. Well...

437
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,600
I'm sorry we broke in,
and...

438
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,000
No harm, no foul.

439
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,600
I'll see you soon.

440
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,900
The mortician said
that death has a design.

441
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm talking about omens.

442
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,600
How do we know,
that just by sitting here...

443
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,400
by sipping this coffee
or breathing the air...

444
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,400
or even crossing
the intersection...

445
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,700
we haven't started in motion...

446
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800
the events that will
some day lead to our death...

447
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,700
forty years from now,
ten years, tomorrow?

448
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,100
We don't,
unless we open ourselves up...

449
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,300
to the signs
it's willing to show us.

450
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,300
I don't understand.

451
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,300
Did you see Tod die?

452
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,300
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

453
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,600
No, it didn't,
but it might as well have.

454
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,400
This is a message
from something, Clear...

455
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,600
or someone,
hinting at a design.

456
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,400
Total bullshit.

457
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,900
You can find death omens
anywhere you want to.

458
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,100
Coffee starts with a "C"
and ends with an "E".

459
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,200
So does "choke."
We'll choke to death?

460
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,400
I want to hear you...

461
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
but we'll go nuts
if you start with this shit.

462
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,400
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

463
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,200
Now, what if
you, me, Tod, Carter...

464
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,600
Terry, Billy, Mrs Lewton
messed up that design?

465
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,200
For whatever reason,
I saw death's plan...

466
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,600
and we cheated it.

467
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,600
But what if it was our time?

468
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,600
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

469
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,900
What if it still is our time?

470
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,500
If it is,
then it's not finished...

471
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,600
and we will die.
Now, not later.

472
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,800
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

473
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,000
After hearing you,
I do believe...

474
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,300
that Tod killed himself.

475
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,000
Baby, come on, not now.

476
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,600
Looks like we have
a reunion here.

477
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,900
Let it go.

478
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,100
-When are you moving?
-Couple weeks.

479
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,300
-That's too bad.
-Carter, you dick!

480
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,400
Losing our favourite teacher.

481
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,500
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

482
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,200
Lived here your whole life,
and now she's gotta move...

483
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,800
We're in danger!

484
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,600
Enough! Both of you!

485
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,700
They died, and we lived.

486
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,500
Get over it.

487
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,600
I will not let
this plane crash...

488
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,100
be the most important thing
in my life!

489
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,700
God!

490
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,300
I'm moving on, Carter...

491
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,500
and if you want
to waste your life...

492
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,200
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

493
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,800
then you can just
drop fucking dead!

494
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,400
Is Alex there?

495
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,100
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.

496
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,900
It's Clear again.
You want to talk to her?

497
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,600
Clear, he's in the shower.

498
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Can I get him to call you back?

499
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,200
Sure. Bye.

500
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,500
She's concerned about you.

501
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,400
I'm concerned about you.

502
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,200
Why won't you talk to her?

503
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,700
Or to me?

504
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,100
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help...

505
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,900
but there's something
I need to understand...

506
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,700
before I can talk.

507
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,300
To anyone.

508
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,500
The National
Transportation Safety Board...

509
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,600
has a new theory tonight
on the cause of the explosion...

510
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,700
of Volee Air flight 180.

511
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,500
Officials believe deterioration
of silicone insulation...

512
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,100
on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

513
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,800
may have leaked
combustible fluids.

514
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,200
That's Tod's seat.

515
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,200
A spark beneath the coach cabin
in the fuselage...

516
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,800
may have ignited the fuel line,
proceeding to the fuel pump...

517
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,800
which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

518
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,800
The path of the explosion.

519
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,600
First was Tod,
then it was Terry.

520
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,300
They're dying in the order
they would've died.

521
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,500
That's death's design.

522
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,300
Ms Lewton's next.

523
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,100
Whenever I can fall asleep,
l see Terry Chaney...

524
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,100
and in the day,
out of nowhere...

525
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,100
I hear the sound of
my own voice in my head...

526
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,200
saying to Larry Murnau...

527
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,200
"No. You know
the whole French thing.

528
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,700
"Get on the plane."

529
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,700
Everything reminds me
of that day.

530
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,100
Right. Yeah.

531
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,500
I'm hoping a change will help.

532
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
It's just that...

533
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,300
I lived here
my whole life, you know?

534
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,600
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

535
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,700
And now all I see
is Larry and those kids.

536
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Just looking out
my own front yard...

537
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,900
makes me feel nothing but fear.

538
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,800
Laura, I'm going to have
to call you back.

539
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,600
Right.

540
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,100
This is Valerie Lewton.
l need Agent Schreck.

541
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,500
What are you doing here?

542
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,400
I was just...

543
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,500
checking the air in the tyre
to make sure it's safe.

544
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,100
Get in the car.

545
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
Put on your seat belt.

546
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,800
I believe that...

547
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,200
that Ms Lewton is next.

548
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,400
Next?

549
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,900
Yeah, next, because...

550
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,900
there's this pattern
that's occurring.

551
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,800
Right. A pattern.

552
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,800
You noticed that, too?

553
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,700
Mom's favourite.

554
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,200
So what about this pattern?

555
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,400
Did you see it
in one of your visions?

556
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,200
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

557
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,700
I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

558
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,900
You guys are going to
sit there and make fun of me.

559
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,100
Whatever. It's fine.

560
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,500
But I saved six lives
on that plane.

561
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,000
Six lives, and everybody
in my entire school...

562
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,300
thinks I'm a freak.

563
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,400
I'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

564
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,800
I don't have
a narcissistic deity complex.

565
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,200
I'm not going Dahmer
on you guys.

566
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,500
This just is.

567
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,300
There is a pattern for us all.

568
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,700
There is a pattern for you.

569
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,400
There is a design for everyone,
and I don't know how yet...

570
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,500
but I'm going to break
this one.

571
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,500
You came to our attention...

572
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,100
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

573
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,500
Now...

574
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,400
I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

575
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,300
We were ready to move on...

576
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,600
but then the other survivors
started to die.

577
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,500
First, your friend Tod...

578
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,200
then Terry Chaney,
while you were at the scene.

579
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,600
And tonight, we pick you up
at Val Lewton's house.

580
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,400
Nobody has control
over life and death...

581
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,100
unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

582
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,900
Can you promise me
no one else is going to die?

583
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,300
No, I can't.

584
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,400
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control.

585
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm sorry.

586
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,100
Go ahead.
Get out of here.

587
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,400
Thank you.

588
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,800
That kid gives me the creeps.

589
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,000
What do we do?
We got nothing.

590
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,000
That's not
what I'm talking about.

591
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,600
There were
a couple of moments...

592
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,300
where I almost believed him.

593
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,800
Don't take this
the wrong way...

594
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,600
but sometimes
you give me the creeps.

595
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,300
You've got to stop this.
It's a stupid mug.

596
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,000
You're out of here.

597
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,700
Pretty soon you'll be gone.

598
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,300
You'll be gone.

599
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,400
All right,
just stay still, OK?

600
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,500
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.

601
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,600
Dude.

602
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,700
I don't know where he is.

603
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,500
He's not talking to me.

604
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,800
Why?

605
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,100
Because I didn't believe him.

606
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,400
If he does contact you,
I think it would be...

607
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,100
in the best interest of
your safety if you called us.

608
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,000
Now, here's my card.

609
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,000
Toll-free number.

610
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,800
Interesting work.

611
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,500
Carter, you dick!

612
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,300
What are you doing?

613
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,900
Terry should be on this wall.

614
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,000
Shit.

615
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,700
Why'd you want us
to meet you here?

616
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,000
They're watching me
to see if I go to Alex.

617
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,300
That's why you're taking me.

618
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,000
Why would I want to see him?

619
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,800
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

620
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,400
Drive the speed limit, OK?

621
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,400
And don't pass on the right.

622
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,300
Billy, wait a minute.
I'm getting a vision.

623
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,500
You're the next one, man.

624
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,300
Man, why'd you say that?

625
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,400
Because if you say another word,
I'll fucking kill you.

626
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,500
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down the road...

627
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
so you guys start that way
and meet back in the middle.

628
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,900
It'll take half the time.

629
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,200
Do you think
they're still up there?

630
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,800
Somehow, flight 180,
are they still in flight?

631
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,500
Somewhere...are they safe?

632
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,400
When I was a kid,
like six or seven...

633
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,100
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

634
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,000
Lying awake at night,
just worrying.

635
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,500
Most kids do, I guess.

636
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,700
Most kids never have it happen.

637
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,500
When I was ten...

638
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,100
my dad went into a 7-Eleven
for cigarettes.

639
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,700
He heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

640
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,600
On reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

641
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,600
A guy blew his head off.

642
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,000
Life became shit after that.

643
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,100
My mom couldn't deal anymore.

644
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,100
She married this asshole
who my mom with my real dad...

645
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,800
would have crossed the street
to avoid this guy.

646
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
He didn't really want a kid...

647
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,900
so my mom didn't, either,
anymore.

648
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,600
If that was the design
for my father and family...

649
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,100
then fuck death!

650
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,300
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere.

651
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,200
It exists, that place...

652
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,100
where my dad is safe.

653
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,900
Where he had a full pack of
cigarettes and kept driving.

654
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,100
Where me and my mom and my dad
are still together...

655
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,200
and have no idea
about this life here.

656
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Where our friends
are still in the sky.

657
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,700
Where everyone
gets a second chance.

658
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,400
Alex, we can't give up.

659
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,800
I can't go home,
because after Mrs Lewton...

660
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,300
they're looking for me.

661
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,500
We're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

662
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,200
It's a couple of miles
from my house.

663
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,500
Browning,
you fucking warlock...

664
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,100
did you hear about
Ms Lewton or what?

665
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,400
Why do you think I was hiding?

666
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,200
Billy told the FBl he saw you
running from her house.

667
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,900
I was running 'cause
they blame me for everything.

668
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,700
They blame me
for Tod, for her...

669
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,200
for the fucking plane crash.

670
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,000
The fire caramelized her blood.

671
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,300
Your shoe prints were in it,
your fingerprints on the knives.

672
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,700
I told you they were not...

673
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,700
I'm not talking about
if you did it.

674
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,600
Or even if
you knew she was dead.

675
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,900
Did you know she was going
to be next before she was?

676
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,200
Yeah, I did.

677
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,700
I knew.

678
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,400
All right, out of us...

679
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,200
who's next to see it?

680
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,000
Please...

681
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,300
tell me I'm going to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

682
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,000
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

683
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,300
I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

684
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
What are you whining about?
I'm next!

685
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,100
He didn't say anything.
Just drive.

686
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,000
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

687
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,100
Think it's easier to know?

688
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,100
It's not.
It's fucking harder.

689
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,400
You get off
having control over me?

690
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,000
Let me decide
how to deal with it.

691
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,800
It doesn't matter who's next...

692
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,700
'cause we're
all on the same list.

693
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,300
Fuck.

694
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,900
Really?

695
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Then why bother?

696
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,500
What's the fucking point?

697
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,600
Me and Terry'll be back
together on the other side...

698
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,200
so why wait any longer?

699
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,800
What are you doing?

700
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,400
Carter, slow down.

701
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,900
-Slow down, Carter!
-Fuck you!

702
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,200
Knock it off!

703
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,200
May as well go out
on my own free will!

704
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,200
Not with us
in the fucking car!

705
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,900
Jesus, Carter!

706
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,000
Carter, stop the car!

707
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,300
What's the fucking worry
if it ain't your time?

708
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:10,200
I can get nailed
running this next red light.

709
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,600
You all wouldn't get shit.

710
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,300
It doesn't work that way!

711
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,100
I fucking hated French class!

712
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,200
-Get control of yourself.
-That's what I'm doing!

713
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,000
I know what you're doing,
and it's all right to be scared.

714
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,500
I'm not afraid.
I decide when it's time.

715
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,600
I control my life.
I control my death.

716
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,100
You don't have to prove
how big your balls are!

717
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,900
Stop driving
like such an asshole.

718
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,700
What are you doing?

719
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,700
Jesus Christ!

720
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,900
Put your hands
back on the wheel!

721
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,000
-Carter, stop!
-Back on the wheel!

722
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,700
Shit.

723
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,500
Carter, easy.

724
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,600
I am so close to puking
right now.

725
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,500
We're afraid, too,
but we're not quitting.

726
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,100
Stop it and stop
this fucking car!

727
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,300
Damn it, I want you
to stop this car right now!

728
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
-Move it.
-Open the door, Billy.

729
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,400
Move the fucking car!

730
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,700
-Open the fucking door.
-Move the car.

731
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,100
-Can't you open the door?
-Open the fucking door.

732
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,700
-Open it!
-Billy, open the door!

733
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,600
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

734
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,100
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!

735
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,100
Carter, listen to me!

736
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,600
This isn't the way!

737
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,700
It's not the way!
Get out of the car!

738
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,500
It's coming!

739
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,000
It ain't my time.

740
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,000
Shit.

741
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
Listen to me!
This isn't the way.

742
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,700
Get out of the car!

743
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,300
Come on! Get out!

744
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,100
I can't get out!

745
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,500
Man, he really is next.

746
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,500
Get out!

747
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,200
Fuck!

748
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,100
Oh, God!

749
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,600
I saw it! I saw the belt!

750
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:35,800
You scared now?

751
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,400
It broke!

752
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,000
Bullshit!

753
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,300
He saved your life again.

754
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:41,800
That's right!

755
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,400
You're next, Carter!

756
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,700
I'm staying the fuck
away from you!

757
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,300
-Shut up, Billy!
-We don't need this shit now.

758
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,200
I don't need it ever!

759
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,700
Get away from him ! He's next!

760
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,400
Fuck you, Billy!
I'm not dead!

761
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,300
You will be.

762
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,600
You're dead...

763
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,200
and you ain't taking me
with you!

764
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,800
-God, no!
-Oh, shit!

765
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,800
Jesus fucking Christ!

766
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,400
You should have been next.

767
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,100
You were after Lewton.
That's the plan!

768
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,500
That's the design!
You should be fucking dead!

769
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,700
You're the devil!

770
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,400
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip!

771
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,400
That's how I saved him.

772
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,200
Just like the explosion.
I saw it!

773
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,500
-The police are coming.
-Fuck! I saved him !

774
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,500
Because I saved him,
it skipped Carter...

775
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,300
and went to the next person
in the path of the explosion!

776
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,200
I have to see it.

777
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,700
Then I intervene...

778
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,200
and if I intervene,
I cheat the design.

779
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,700
Intervene? Are you God now?

780
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,100
God's not afraid to die.

781
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,400
Gods don't die! We do!

782
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,700
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.

783
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,600
We have to get you
back to my cabin.

784
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,600
You can hide out
and get your head together.

785
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,800
After Billy, I'm next.

786
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,400
I'm next.

787
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,800
Then me.

788
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,900
Listen, I'm not going
to let it happen.

789
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,400
Listen to me.

790
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,900
Why don't you two
get the fuck out of here?

791
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,800
Rusted.

792
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,500
Tetanus.

793
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,400
Nice one.

794
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,400
I overlooked it.

795
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,400
You tried to capitalize,
but I caught you.

796
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,100
You fuck!

797
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,800
I can beat you.

798
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,700
Maybe not forever...

799
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,900
but I got this cabin
rigged to beat you now!

800
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,800
She was there a minute ago.

801
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,800
What are you talking about?

802
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,200
I'm not turning him in.

803
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,100
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

804
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,200
I go with you.

805
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,400
You can't.

806
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,800
Just tell us where he is.

807
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,700
Wait at home.
I give you my word...

808
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,800
we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

809
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,900
I never moved.

810
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,800
Christa asked me to change,
but I never moved.

811
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,400
I would have been up
next to Tod.

812
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,600
Fuck!
Why didn't I remember that?

813
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,300
I never moved. Clear's seat
was in front of mine.

814
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,600
She's next.

815
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,300
Get in the car!
We're going around!

816
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,800
-There!
-Come on, let's go!

817
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,000
Alex, we're trying to help you.

818
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,800
Prince! Get away from it!

819
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,700
Hold on!

820
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,000
Run!

821
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,100
We lost him.

822
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,700
From the direction, there's only
one place he's heading.

823
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,700
No shit.

824
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,400
Oh, my God!

825
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,700
Don't move! Stay there!

826
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,200
Don't move!

827
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,500
Don't touch anything.
You're grounded by the tyres.

828
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,800
The car's going to explode!

829
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,900
I can only hold on for so long.
You know what to do.

830
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:27,700
Don't!

831
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,200
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll all be over.

832
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,200
It's the only way
we can cheat death again.

833
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,900
Don't!

834
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,300
I am not going to let it
beat us both.

835
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,100
You know what to do!

836
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,200
I'll always be with you.

837
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,500
Don't!

838
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,600
Get away from there!

839
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,700
Damn it!
You can't do this to me.

840
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,600
Come on, baby. Come on.

841
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,700
Shit, he's not breathing.

842
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,000
Hold on, Alex. Come on.
Stay with me.

843
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,200
Well, we made it.

844
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,500
Paris.
I can't believe it.

845
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,800
I can't believe
we got on a plane again.

846
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,300
Know what I'm saying?

847
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,100
It's weird being here, huh?

848
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,000
We finally completed a puzzle.

849
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,900
It's just
there's something missing.

850
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:56,400
You know?

851
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,900
To Terry.

852
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,200
And to Tod.

853
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,900
To all of our friends
that can't be here.

854
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,600
Cheers.

855
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,700
What?

856
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,200
If you would've told me
six months ago...

857
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,000
the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

858
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,100
I don't know.
Sometimes it feels like...

859
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,000
you two are the only ones
who understand.

860
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,800
You were right, Browning.

861
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,700
It did skip us.
There was a design.

862
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,300
We beat it. We won.

863
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,600
The only thing we won
is a chance at a full life.

864
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,900
A chance
that I won't ever waste.

865
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:47,500
There's just something
I can't figure out.

866
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,400
-About what?
-The design.

867
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Just let it go, all right?

868
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,000
Hear me out, all right?

869
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,700
-Oh, my God.
-Just listen.

870
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,400
The explosion path determined
the order of our deaths.

871
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,700
When I intervened
and saved Carter...

872
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,400
it skipped him and went
to the next person--Billy.

873
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,900
Then it was Clear.

874
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,900
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me.

875
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:18,000
But in my case,
no one intervened, right?

876
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,400
I was thrown
from that power line...

877
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,200
by the explosion, so...

878
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,500
So why did it skip you?

879
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,200
How do we know this isn't
what was meant to happen?

880
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,700
That out of everyone
on flight 180...

881
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,400
you, me, and Carter
were meant to live?

882
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,500
Maybe that was
the design all along.

883
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,400
-Or you could still be next.
-Shut up, Carter.

884
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,000
I didn't make up the rules.

885
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,400
Somebody's got to intervene
before death can skip them.

886
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,600
Alex proved that three times
with the plane, me, and you.

887
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,800
For all I know,
it could circle back...

888
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:51,400
and get us all again.

889
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,400
But I am the safest fucker
in the world...

890
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,200
because you're still next.

891
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,100
Can we just stop talking
about this?

892
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,000
Let's figure out...

893
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,700
I'll meet you back
at the hotel.

894
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,100
I'll go with you.

895
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,000
No, just stay here,
OK, Clear?

896
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,300
All right?

897
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,000
See? It's true.
I told you you were next, man.

898
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,800
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.

899
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,300
Clear, stay there, OK?

900
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,000
Stay away.

901
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,400
-I told you you were next!
-It skipped me.

902
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,400
So who's next?
