1
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,470
I speak English.

2
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,438
You speak English?

3
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,451
I must talk fast.

4
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,314
There are things in this village
you do not know about.

5
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,757
They cannot get away with this...

6
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,559
these devils.

7
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,747
Did anybody see you?

8
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,340
Forgive them.
They have been through so much.

9
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,401
Are they yours?

10
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,647
They are daughters of my niece.

11
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,371
Soraya.

12
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,074
I am Zahra.

13
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,411
Zahra.

14
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,182
Zahra,

15
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,528
are you crazy?

16
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,259
They think so.

17
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,858
And after this...

18
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,203
and inviting a stranger
into your home...

19
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,442
I'm inclined to agree.

20
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,507
Sit, please.

21
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,808
I will give you some tea...

22
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,412
then you decide who is crazy,

23
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,450
me or them.

24
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,658
A smoke?

25
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:38,717
The ayatollahs have banned women
from smoking.

26
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,950
Today I am old...

27
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,622
a hundred years older than yesterday.

28
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,458
But I know right from wrong.

29
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,834
What happened here yesterday

30
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,361
was wrong.

31
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,097
Yesterday.

32
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,639
The devil himself visited this town...

33
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,051
and Allah the Merciful know it.

34
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,287
God willing, you will know it too.

35
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,691
Start your machine.

36
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,894
Voices of women do not matter in here.

37
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,140
I want you to take my voice with you.

38
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,051
Why should I listen to you

39
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,143
if, as you say...

40
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,686
the voices of women
no longer matter anywhere in this country.

41
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,419
Hear my story first.

42
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,064
You will know why you should listen.

43
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,167
There are men in this town

44
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,942
who are wild dogs.

45
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,011
Their hunt began not long ago

46
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,520
with Soraya's husband...

47
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,278
Ali.

48
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:23,463
They refused to let us bury her.

49
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:28,099
We took her body and left it by the river.

50
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:38,403
In the town,
they were celebrating.

51
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:07,604
That was yesterday.

52
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:12,140
This morning, before dawn...

53
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:14,570
I went back to the river...

54
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:19,546
and buried what dogs had left of her.
