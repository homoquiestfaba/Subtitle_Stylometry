and the money he threw around.

188
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,650
He actually endeared himself

189
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,957
to the neighborhood
pretty quickly.

190
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,568
Oh, come on, I thought you guys
said you were fast!

191
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,015
[cheering] Zachary!

192
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,930
Melanie, I apologize
if my next question

193
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,366
makes you uncomfortable.

194
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,587
But I spoke with a
few of your neighbors,

195
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,981
and some of them seemed
to be under the impression

196
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,374
that you and Jason...

197
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,724
[Melanie] What?

198
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,683
Might have had an
intimate relationship.

199
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,816
That's completely ridiculous.

200
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,127
So there's no truth to it?

201
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,781
No,

202
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:31,958
Jason and me, no!

203
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,917
We couldn't be more mismatched.

the suburbs and he's him.

206

an intimate relationship.

Yeah, you need to relax.

Zach is a great kid,

Well, it's nice to finally

Derek Brown on the phone.

What's this all about?

242
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,168
[Debt Collector] I need to
speak with Jason immediately.

243

Why?

244
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,128
[Debt Collector] Because
he owes us a lot of money.

245
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,870
You hear me? So you tell your
brother to get on the phone

246
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:45,395
or we're gonna track him
down and get our money back.

247
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,962
And if we don't hear from him,

248
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,095
then we'll get the police
involved and throw him in jail.

249

How do you think
he'll like that?

gonna be able to do that.

the name Jason Derek Brown is?

from people like you,

and tired of having

to explain myself
over and over again.

bring him back.

So Jason vacates your property
here on Nighthawk Way

273
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,260
with six months
left on his lease?

274
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:09,566
He must have given you
a good reason for that.

275
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,960
Yeah, he said his
brother's wife was sick

276
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,396
with breast cancer.

277
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,008
And he wanted to go spend
time with his family.

278
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,185
It seemed like a good
enough reason for me.

brother and his wife, Amy,

I have a tough time
believing that.

He's a con man, Melanie,
plain and simple.

This is what he does.

if all this news about Jason

Yeah, yeah.

He, he always looked
so young for his age.

369
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,923
Jamie, I know this has
been difficult for you,

370
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:53,274
but what I'm trying to
understand is what went wrong?

371
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,494
How did your brother go from
this sweet, sensitive kid

372
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,366

373

376
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:16,515
You like this hotel room?

377
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:22,564
It's better than the rooms
we had in Vegas.

378
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,611
Right?
Jason, pour me a tall one.

379

not enough for you?

385
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:56,859
I just miss her.

It's not your fault.

391

Your mother's just
a cold, weak person.

392
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,310
She's a loser.

You won't let us see her.

If it's not true,

396
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,274
then how come she didn't
fight harder for full custody?

397
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,363
She asked me for a divorce,

398
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,234
and then she gives
up on you three.

399
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,759
She didn't give up.
You lied.

to be a reason.

that we could rewrite the
narrative of our relationship,

exactly what we both need.

[mother] Jason, what is this?

00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,319
This is my new business,

486
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,712
and we are huge in
local markets right now

487
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:58,367
because I have billboards
up and down the coast.

488
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,500
- Billboards?
- Yeah, you would not believe

489
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:01,980
how much money these
things make me.

490
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:05,592

fiscal year to date.

you see that Cadillac.

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,900
I own that now, mom.

493
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,424
That's how much I'm crushing it.

494
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,991
And I'm not the
only one profiting.

495

All of my investors are
making money, hand over fist.

We're talking 200 percent
return on investments.

497
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:21,869
So I started thinking,

498
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:24,219
you know like,
why can't I do this

499
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:25,873
for the people that I love?

500
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:30,182
I started thinking,
why can't I do this for you,

501
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:35,143
and mom, I know that
I have not been the best son.

502
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:36,492
Right, and I messed
some things up,

503
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:39,017
but I do believe that
this can change that.

504
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,106
And I do know for a fact

505
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:46,067
that if you invested $20,000...

506
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,069
Yeah, $20,000.

507
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:50,245

What do you say?

513
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:07,001
I was wondering
how long it had been

514
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,395
since I'd last seen you.

515
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:12,224
But then I realized
this is your first time

516
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,268
seeing this house.

517
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,140
You know how long ago it was

00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:16,706
that David got it for me?

519
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,405
Well, we're gonna get you
a better one after I'm done.

520
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,059
Three years.

521
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:24,062
That's how long it's been
since you visited me.

522
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,326
I know, and truly, I'm sorry.

523
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,937
And then you have the audacity

524
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,376
to walk in here and ask me
for $20,000?

525
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,813
Twenty thousand dollars
of my money?

526
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:40,556
This is a huge
opportunity, huge.

527
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,776
For whom exactly, tell me.

528
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,038
For both of us.

529
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,608
Cut the shit, Jason, please.

530
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,959
How stupid do you think I am?

531
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:54,614
I know you borrowed money
from David, from Jamie.

532
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,746
It's not true.
They invested.

533
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,009
And then you come
here prancing around

534
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,577
in a fucking Cadillac.

535
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:02,665
I had a good year, mom.

536
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,319
Son!

537
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,799
I know that car isn't yours.

538
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:09,890
I know there's no business,
no opportunity.

539
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:13,676
So no, I won't be investing.

540
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,027
Yep, well,

541
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:20,901
mom, I think you
really might want to...

542
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,337
rethink that one because I mean

543
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,513
the profits we made
this year alone,

544
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:26,385
do you understand how much
money that you could make?

545
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,995
Enough!

546
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,432
Jesus Christ!

547
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:31,738
Who do you think you're fooling

548
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:34,306
with all that CEO talk bullshit?

549
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,742
I'm your mother!

550
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,139
Is there any part
of that brain of yours

551
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,532
that could just
tell you to stop?

552
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,591
I'm sorry, Jason.

553
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,810
I can't lend you any more money.

554
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,814
I know that's why you drop by,

555
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:07,208
'cause of course
that's the only reason

556
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,384
you ever do come by,

557
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:12,082
but I just can't
do it this time.

558
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:15,173
I'm in trouble, mom,
I'm in big trouble.

559
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:18,176
I need your help, please.

560
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:23,311
You're some actor,
you know that.

561
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,488
I'm not acting. I'm not acting.

562
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,491
These guys,
if I don't pay them money,

563
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:30,710
they're gonna kill me.

564
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,233
Oh, God,

565
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:35,410
you really are
your father's son.

566
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:40,502
Sometimes I think the only
difference between you two

567
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:44,332
is that you are just
delusional enough

568
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,552
to buy your own bullshit!

569
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,909
I'm sorry, Jason.
I shouldn't have said that.

570
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:57,867
No, no, no.

571
00:36:57,911 --> 00:36:59,217
It's...

572
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,656
it's all right.

573
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:11,098
I should go.

574
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:14,275
I should go.

575
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:21,413
Do you know what gives
me great comfort?

576
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,153
Is that a year from now

577
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:25,808
I'm gonna be
sunbathing on a yacht.

578
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:27,288
Sailing the Pacific

579
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,986
with seven Victoria's
Secret supermodels.

580
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,032
Roaming the globe
and living it up.

581
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,774
And do you know where
you're gonna be, mom?

582
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:41,084
Right fucking here, all alone.

583
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:45,132
A mean, old miserable bitch.

584
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:51,312
Get out, now.

585
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,618
Get outta my house.

586
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,185
It was a nice visit.

587
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,624
See you again in
another four years.

588
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,414
Goodbye, Jason.

589
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,593
[somber music]

590
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,334
[Jason] It's my dad's.

591
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,379
No, my father's.

592
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,729
This was my father's.

593
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,082
He died peacefully.

594
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,866
He died peacefully.

595
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,913
He lived, he lived a good life.

596
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:29,307
This,

597
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:33,441
this one was my mom's.

598
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:36,096
She left this for me.

599
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,317
She left me this
recently because she, um,

600
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,797
she recently passed away.

601
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,233
She recently passed away.

602
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:47,063
She was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer,

603
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:51,329
which was very painful for her.

604
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,159
And it was very painful
for me, too.

605
00:38:56,203 --> 00:39:00,468
You know,
because we were so close.

606
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:03,776
We were so close, me and
that miserable fucking bitch,

607
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,168
yeah.

608
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,258
I am so fucking good, bro.

609
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:12,393
Real fucking tears.

610
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:19,618
She's my...

611
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:21,402
she's my best friend.

612
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,231
She was my best friend.

613
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,628
It was a nice visit, yeah.

614
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,674
Thanks, mom.

615
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,851
Thanks, dad.

616
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,897
Wherever the fuck you are.

617
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:48,560
[car door slamming]

618
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:04,706
Hi.

619
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,069
Here you go, Leising.

620
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,293
[Jamie] Ten years ago,

621
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:29,035
my brother was a completely
different person.

622
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:32,212
He was married.
He was a Mormon, straight edge.

623
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,561
I mean he was
a missionary in France.

624
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:36,390
That, that was his whole life.

625
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,481
Ten years ago, you said?

626
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,569
Yeah.

627
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:42,875
Isn't that right about the time

628
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:45,573
that your father went missing?

629
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,406
Jamie?

630
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,714
Dad's probably on
a beach somewhere

631
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,238
drinking mai tais.

632
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:01,720
Probably trying to fuck a nurse
or something, you know.

633
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,765
[David] Fuck a nurse?

634
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:06,855
Yeah, dad loves nurses.

635
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,640
Seriously, man.

636
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:14,646
I remember he used to say nurses
are the most sexual women.

637
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,691
I don't remember
him saying that.

638
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:18,911
Does sound like some
shit he would say.

639
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,566
He's gonna have stories
when he gets back.

640
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,482
[David] J, I don't think
he's coming back, man.

641
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:28,616
Well, if that's happening
then so is this.

642
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:35,101
It's a little big for you, no?

643
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,711
I get it fitted.

644
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,321
You know, it's probably fake.

645
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:41,760
Oh, you jealous bro,
that you didn't grab it first?

646
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,413
[David] I couldn't care less,
man, let's go.

647
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:47,113
[Jamie] Jason, David,
what the hell is going on?

648
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,636
- [Jason] Hey.
- [David] Hi.

649
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,811
Hi?

650
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:51,900
What the fuck? Where is dad?

651
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:54,729
Hello?

652
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,383
What the hell are
you guys packing?

653
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,777
I mean, obviously you've
been talking to him.

654
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,995
Don't get involved, Jamie.

655
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,170
Don't tell me to fuck off.

656
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:03,129
Don't tell me to
not get involved.

657
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,610
All right, the cops called me.

658
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:06,654
- Yeah?
- [Jamie] Yeah.

659
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:07,960
What did you tell them?

660
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:09,222
I don't know, David.

661
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:10,832
Nothing, 'cause I
don't know anything.

662
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:13,313
So can you just please tell
me what the hell is going on?

663
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:14,967
What did they tell you?

664
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,621
I, I don't know.

665
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:19,667
Oh, they found his car
abandoned in Brownsville, Texas

666
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,103
right by the Mexican border.

667
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:23,018
So explain this to me.

668
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:25,020
Don't get involved.

669
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:27,153
- Let's go.
- Seriously, David?

670
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:32,158
Hey, hey, Jason.

671
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:34,595
Can you please just tell me
what the hell is going on?

672
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,466
Yeah, hey, don't worry about it.

673
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,600
We're just squaring
some stuff away for him.

674
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:40,993
Dad's coming back.

675
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,259
I always tell you the truth.

676
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:50,045
You know that, right?

677
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:52,526
- [truck horn honking]
- [David] Let's go!

678
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,615
So annoying.

679
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,486
Those pants look better on me.

680
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:59,054
Stop.

681
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,403
I'll let you borrow them.

682
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,362
[Jason] There's that smile.
Love you.

683
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:03,493
Love you.

684
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:08,455
[engine humming]

685
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:20,032
[buttons beeping]

686
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:23,775
Come on!

687
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,137
[thuds]

688
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:42,184
[engine humming]

689
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:24,444
This is the Glock model 21.

690
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:26,315
It's a 45 ACP.

691
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,274
This is what your
Secret Service uses.

692
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:29,884
Military personnel.

693
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:32,844
A lot of police officers choose
that as a service weapon.

694
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,675
[suspenseful music]

695
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:46,074
How do I look?

696
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:47,597
Deadly.

697
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:48,990
Good answer.

698
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,827
[camera clicking]

699
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,176
You wanna shoot it?

700
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,395
Fuck yeah.

701
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,093
[gun firing]

702
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,650
[officer] Kyle Wallace.

703
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,348
- Open up.
- [knocking on door]

704
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:45,481
- Police.
- [knocking on door]

705
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,269
Kyle!

706
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,534
[dramatic music]

707
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:58,930
[yelps]

708
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,715
Get the fuck off me, man!
Get the fuck off.

709
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,804
I didn't do nothing!

710
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,327
Pieces of shit.

711
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,894
I didn't fucking do nothing.

712
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:08,809
This is bullshit.

713
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,419
[Leising] All right,
Kyle, let's go.

714
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:11,986
Tell me how you know this guy.

715
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,992
Who that, man?

716
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:20,081
He put down the address
of this apartment

717
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,475
when he bought a Glock.

718
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:24,129
Now I know you know Jason,

719
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,653
and I know he's
been here recently.

720
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,049
So let's try this again.

721
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,617
How do you know this guy?

722
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:39,535
All right, I met
Jason a while back.

723
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:41,929
Come on.

724
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,191
It's not like we
close or anything.

725
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:46,151
He's a fun dude
to party with and shit.

726
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:47,761
Anyway, he came through here

727
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,415
completely out the blue.

728
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,286
Word on the street,
he had gambling debt

729
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,158
to some coldblooded
motherfuckers.

730
00:46:57,336 --> 00:47:01,122
[Jason] Yo, Kyle Wallace!

731
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,037
Dude borrowed money
from everyone.

732
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:06,432
Okay.

733
00:47:06,475 --> 00:47:07,868
[Kyle] Jason?

734
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:10,131
Oh, buddy.

735
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:12,568
What are you doing here?

736
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:13,700
Passing through, dog.

737
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:16,181
Yo, come kick it
with me for a bit.

738
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:18,400
Man, I heard you were in some
deep shit, like for real.

739
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,750
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

740
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,100
I took care of that.

741
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,318
Money's in the account.

742
00:47:23,362 --> 00:47:24,842
It's all straight, I swear.

743
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,061
Kick with me for a bit.

744
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:29,324
I got something I wanna
talk to you about.

745
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:32,153
I got a little uh...

746
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:35,200
A little opportunity
I wanna run by you.

747
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,029
[loud snorting]

748
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:39,378
Oh fuck.

749
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:40,770
That's good shit.

750
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,250
- [Jason] Yeah.
- It's Cali shit?

751
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:44,992
[both groaning]

752
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:48,648
So are you going to tell
me about this opportunity?

753
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:49,867
What's good?

754
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,043
Yeah, bro.

755
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:54,436
Check it out.

756
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:02,183
I'm gonna rob an armored truck,

757
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:04,359
and I want you to help me.

758
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:05,970
Now look, I've done
a bunch of research.

759
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:07,188
Now check it out, check it out.

760
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,451
A fucking box office
from a theater

761
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:10,844
on a big fucking weekend,

762
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,280
like a weekend after
fucking Thanksgiving

763
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:16,328
can have up to $300,000 cash.

764
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:17,329
On hand, right?

765
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:19,070
- Right?
- Right.

766
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:20,680
- [Jason] Right?
- Right.

767
00:48:20,723 --> 00:48:22,508
So now the fucking armored truck
pulls up outside the theater

768
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:23,639
on the Monday morning.

769
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,815
That guard walks
with one fucking bag

770
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:29,341
full of all that cash,

771
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:30,951
all that fucking cash.

772
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,735
So on his walk from
the fucking theater

773
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,128
into the fucking truck,

774
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,391
that motherfucker's
completely fucking vulnerable.

775
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,959
Kyle, it's like one man

776
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,830
against a loaded gun.

777
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,397
You know what I'm saying?

778
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:43,790
It's practically risk free.

779
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,357
All you gotta do...

780
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,664
is pop him first.

781
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:49,970
You know?

782
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:54,496
You're fucking with me, right?

783
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,845
No.

784
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:58,239
Motherfucker, you ever
popped a dude before?

785
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,547
Have you?

786
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,157
I haven't had to, but
I've seen dudes get shot,

787
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:04,593
and let me tell
you something, bro.

788
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:06,421
That shit's above
your pay grade.

789
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:11,992
Yeah, yeah.

790
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:15,387
Yeah, yeah.

791
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,433
Yeah. Is that a no, mommy?

792
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:19,826
Is that a no, mommy?

793
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:23,003
[chuckling]

794
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,570
But I want to, mommy.

795
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:27,051
[laughing]

796
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,577
But I want to, mommy!

797
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,795
You fucking with me.

798
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,232
I've seen dudes get shot!

799
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,363
I've been in the mud!

800
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,018
[laughing]

801
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,281
I've seen things!

802
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:43,154
You know what I'm saying?

803
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:46,418
Yo, yo, yo, answer me
one fucking question

804
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:48,246
right fucking now.

805
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,943
[Kyle] What the fuck, bro?

806
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,467
Is this shit still above
my fucking pay grade?

807
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,121
What the fuck?

808
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:56,515
I'm not fucking kidding, dawg.
Put the fucking shit down.

809
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:01,563
Click, it's empty, bro.

810
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,350
Fucking, what the fuck was that?

811
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:07,874
- Ow!
- Fucking crazy!

812
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:09,310
Think that shit's funny?

813
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:12,705
- I'll slap your shit!
- I'm fucking with you.

814
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:14,315
Get the fuck out of my house!

815
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,535
- Yo, Kyle!
- Get the fuck out of my house!

816
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:18,319
When did you turn into such
a whiny ass little bitch?

817
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:20,234
- I'm joking.
- I ain't no fucking bitch!

818
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:21,235
Get the fuck out of my house!

819
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:23,237
I'm sorry, all right?

820
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:26,023
Dude, chill, I'm kidding.

821
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,328
Dude, fucking chill, bitch.

822
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:30,070
Get your panties out
of a fucking bunch.

823
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,637
- You're fucking out of it.
- [Jason] Oh!

824
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,727
Whatever path you're on,
Jason... That's all you, bro.

825
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:39,123
Fucking Kyle Wallace
is a fucking pussy.

826
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,689
[Kyle] Fuck off!

827
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:47,131
Kyle Wallace is fucking pussy.
[blabbering]

828
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:51,570
And that's it.

829
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:53,093
I ain't seen him
again after that.

830
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:55,530
He called me fucking
16 times the next day,

831
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:56,749
but I didn't pick up.

832
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,142
I just avoided him.

833
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:01,971
Hmm.

834
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:04,931
All right, Kyle.

835
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:07,368
Book him.

836
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,241
What the fuck, man?
I didn't do shit!

837
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,416
This is bullshit!

838
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,287
Fucking, fuck you guys!

839
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:14,593
Fucking pigs.

840
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:15,985
Goddamn it.

841
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:21,774
[man] Three days.

842
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:23,428
You fucking understand?

843
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:28,215
[Debt Collector] I need to
speak to Jason immediately,

844
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:30,565
'cause he owes us
a lot of money.

845
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,567
You hear me?

846
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,178
[Jeanne] How stupid
do you think I am?

847
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:38,269
I know you borrowed money
from David, from Jamie.

848
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,097
[loan officer]
I'm sorry, Mr. Harline,

849
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,272
but you're maxed out.

850
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:42,577
[Jeanne]
And then you come here.

851
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:46,233
Prancing around in
a fucking Cadillac.

852
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:47,539
[loan officer]
You want some advice, kid?

853
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:48,888
Go to the arcade.

854
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:51,543
Have a good time,
for God's sake.

855
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:53,371
[Debt Collector]
So you tell your brother,

856
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:55,460
get on the phone or we're
gonna get the police involved

857
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:57,157
and throw him in jail.

858
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,117
[Jeanne] Is there any part
of that brain of yours

859
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,511
that could just
tell you to stop!

860
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,215
[slow suspenseful music]

861
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,679
[door rattling]

862
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:29,467
[engine humming]

863
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,387
Hey, Mel.

864
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,304
Yeah, guess who?

865
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,830
- Hi.
- Hi.

866
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:46,223
I was pretty surprised
when he called.

867
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,834
I hadn't heard from him
in over a year, I think.

868
00:53:49,878 --> 00:53:50,923
[Zachary] Jason!

869
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,273
Ah-ha!

870
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:54,666
[Melanie] And he said he was
just passing through town,

871
00:53:54,709 --> 00:53:56,972
and he needed a place
to stay for a few nights.

872
00:53:57,973 --> 00:53:59,236
So what did you say?

873
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,239
I said of course.

874
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:03,805
Truth be told,

875
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,765
he was a pretty
great house guest.

876
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:08,332
He'd usually go out
in the mornings,

877
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:12,031
and then stay gone
most of the day.

878
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:31,050
[Jason laughing]

879
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:58,686
The ball is high,
the ball is deep!

880
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,645
It's gone!

881
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:02,124
Yes!

882
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,567
So he stayed with you
for 10 days?

883
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,655
I guess.

884
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:12,570
Didn't really feel
like that long.

885
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:16,443
[soft moaning]

886
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:51,609
But he didn't spend
Thanksgiving with you, right?

887
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:52,697
Yeah.

888
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,089
He left the morning of.

889
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,224
He said he had to spend
it with his family.

890
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:05,492
I really think you should
spend Thanksgiving with us.

891
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:06,841
Yeah, baby, you know I want to,

892
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:08,365
but I gotta spend it
with Jamie this year.

893
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:10,454
Otherwise she'll kill me.

894
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,456
Come on, you really
shouldn't be mad.

895
00:56:12,499 --> 00:56:13,457
I'm not.

896
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,936
Hey, hey.

897
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:18,157
You shouldn't be sad either.

898
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,376
You wanna know why?

899
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,204
Why, why?

900
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:25,294
Because I'm moving
back here in January.

901
00:56:26,905 --> 00:56:27,949
No, you're not.

902
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:30,038
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

903
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:31,649
I'm coming back here in January.

904
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:35,740
So can the two of you wait
a couple months for me?

905
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:38,264
'Cause if I come back here,

906
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:40,179
if I roll up back here
and there's another dude

907
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:43,443
living in the street, you
know, across the street,

908
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,966
and he come in here
and swept you off your feet,

909
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,228
I swear to God,

910
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:49,014
I'm going to throw you
off the roof.

911
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,151
- Really?
- Yeah, hey.

912
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,028
I love you.

913
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:36,975
Hey, buddy.

914
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:39,760
I gotta hit the road.

915
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,023
But before I do,

916
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,198
I wanted to give you this,

917
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:46,158
like an early Christmas present.

918
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:49,161
No way!

919
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:51,946
This is amazing.

920
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:56,081
Thank you.

921
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:02,566
You're welcome.

922
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:10,878
Melanie, I hate having
to tell you this,

923
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:13,185
but he lied to you again.

924
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:15,317
Jason didn't spend
Thanksgiving with Jamie

925
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,319
or anyone from his family.

926
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:23,151
Instead, he spent it
alone at a motel,

927
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:24,805
just five miles from your house.

928
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:29,027
No, that...

929
00:58:30,898 --> 00:58:32,291
that can't be true.

930
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:34,946
I'm sorry.

931
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:38,471
No, that's just,

932
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,691
just not the Jason I know.

933
00:58:44,956 --> 00:58:46,348
It's just not.

934
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,003
[gun firing]

935
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:52,224
[suspenseful music]

936
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:43,275
For someone who did a lot
of dumb and illegal shit,

937
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:45,277
I find it fascinating
that the only thing

938
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,539
on your brother's record,

939
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,628
up until this point of course,

940
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,630
was a shoplifting charge.

941
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:55,461
Apparently, Jason stole
a dozen golf clubs.

942
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:02,033
Did you also know that
your little brother

943
01:00:02,076 --> 01:00:03,382
had a habit of telling people

944
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:05,036
that you and him had
a business together

945
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:07,473
importing and exporting
golf equipment?

946
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:18,266
I think you helped Jason rob
that golf store five years ago.

947
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:31,802
- [David] Hey, how you doing?
- Fine, how can I help you?

948
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:33,194
Yeah, you know what?

949
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:35,066
I'm looking
for a couple new shirts.

950
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:36,981
- [Clerk] Right this way.
- [David] Great.

951
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,374
Is there particular?

952
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,402
Yeah, I took the price
tags off of these clubs.

953
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:10,579
I'm gonna make some new ones
in fucking Microsoft Paint.

954
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:11,798
Well, why would you do that?

955
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:13,800
What are you talking about?

956
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,889
I'm going to take
these fucking clubs,

957
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,111
and I'm going to scratch
some fucking Chinese symbols

958
01:01:20,154 --> 01:01:21,678
into the head of them,

959
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:23,418
and then we're gonna
sell these motherfuckers

960
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:26,030
to some dumb motherfucker
with some deep ass pockets.

961
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:28,902
Wait, do you think anybody's
gonna fall for that shit?

962
01:01:28,946 --> 01:01:31,426
I mean, how stupid
do you think people are?

963
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,865
Ah, I think they're pretty
fucking stupid.

964
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:37,824
Plus bro, you forgot
the most important part.

965
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:39,043
What's that?

966
01:01:39,086 --> 01:01:40,522
- It's me.
- Come on, bud.

967
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:43,961
It's me, I could sell ice
to a motherfucking Eskimo.

968
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,179
Have another sip.

969
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:48,400
- [laughing]
- [siren blaring]

970
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:51,272
Shit, shit! Shit.

971
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,232
Oh, man.

972
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:57,104
[laughing]

973
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:03,894
Amy's gonna kill me.

974
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:05,199
Amy's gonna fucking kill me.

975
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,548
Dude, she's not going
to fucking kill you.

976
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:09,073
No, no, she's gonna
call off the wedding.

977
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:11,553
Okay, okay.

978
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:15,035
I'm serious, dude.

979
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,471
What are you doing, man?

980
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:29,006
Ice to an Eskimo, bro.

981
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:32,705
- What are you doing?
- You owe me.

982
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:46,980
How you doing?

983
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:57,077
[soft suspenseful music]

984
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,846
See this, huh?

985
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:30,676
[man] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

986
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:35,463
Now remember kids,
don't drink and drive.

987
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:45,822
Anybody want to come sit
on the captain's lap?

988
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:00,793
I love my boat.

989
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,925
Are you having a good time?

990
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:03,883
We're here to have a good time.

991
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:06,190
That's what we do.

992
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:08,845
That's what we do!

993
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:50,669
[engine humming]

994
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:59,591
[engine humming]

995
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,486
[gun clicking]

996
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:12,490
[intensifying music]

997
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:27,374
[gun firing]

998
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:30,508
[people screaming]

999
01:06:33,902 --> 01:06:36,557
[gun firing]

1000
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:19,600
[indistinct chattering]

1001
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,436
[helicopter whirring]

1002
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:32,891
This was an execution.

1003
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,809
[bags rustling]

1004
01:08:43,684 --> 01:08:45,556
For 56,000 dollars?

1005
01:08:58,438 --> 01:08:59,744
There's our guy.

1006
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:03,748
[phone buzzing]

1007
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,409
Hello?

1008
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:16,021
[Melanie] Hey, I tried
calling you this weekend.

1009
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:17,544
Hey, Mel, yeah.

1010
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:20,243
Sorry, I uh,

1011
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:22,549
I spent the weekend
with my brother's family.

1012
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:26,249
[Melanie] That's okay,
I just missed you.

1013
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:27,424
[helicopter whirring]

1014
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,774
Yeah, I missed you guys too.

1015
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,689
How's my little guy?

1016
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:33,343
[Zachary] Jason!

1017
01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:35,432
Hey, buddy.

1018
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:37,347
You playing those games?

1019
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:39,305
[Zachary]
Yeah, they're awesome.

1020
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:41,351
I was just playing Halo.

1021
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:44,005
- Nice.
- [Zachary] It's so fun.

1022
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:45,311
Thanks so much.

1023
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:47,052
You got it, bud.
You got it.

1024
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:50,795
Listen, tell your mom
I'll call her later, okay?

1025
01:09:56,409 --> 01:09:59,151
[bags rustling]

1026
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:06,506
[engine humming]

1027
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:25,569
[helicopter whirring]

1028
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:28,267
[police chopper] This is
Chopper One calling dispatch.

1029
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:29,529
I found an abandoned
mountain bike

1030
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:31,749
matching the description, over.

1031
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,798
Check it out.

1032
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:39,496
We got a partial.

1033
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:44,414
The match came through
on the partial print.

1034
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:47,417
This is our prime suspect.

1035
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,681
[buttons beeping]

1036
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:20,885
[doorbell ringing]

1037
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:26,369
I'm outta here, okay?

1038
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:27,631
Okay.

1039
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:29,763
Smells good.

1040
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:31,591
Dinner is at?

1041
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:32,940
5:30.

1042
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:34,681
- Five.
- Five.

1043
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:36,335
Don't be late.

1044
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,511
- Love you.
- Love you.

1045
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:42,080
Dad needs a hug.

1046
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:44,125
- [Kids] No!
- Dad needs a hug, come here!

1047
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:46,258
Okay!

1048
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,434
Tighter, tighter.

1049
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:49,740
Too tight, too tight!

1050
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,396
Okay, see you guys.

1051
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:54,397
Listen to your mom.

1052
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,702
Can I say hi to my nieces?

1053
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:58,749
Actually they kind
got a busy morning.

1054
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:00,620
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1055
01:12:10,543 --> 01:12:12,284
I need to ask you a favor.

1056
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,634
Yeah?

1057
01:12:14,678 --> 01:12:17,376
Yeah.
Not to borrow money, is it?

1058
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,683
No, no, it's not.

1059
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:23,208
You remember my silver BMW?

1060
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:25,036
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1061
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:28,431
I got it in my storage unit.

1062
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:30,215
I need you to,

1063
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:32,348
to go get the car and
take it to the shop for me

1064
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,653
and have it detailed,

1065
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:36,308
like fully detailed,
like carpets, seats,

1066
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,962
dashboard, everything.

1067
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:40,965
Why?

1068
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,270
Can't ask why.

1069
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:44,838
Come on, man.

1070
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:46,274
I will fully reimburse
you the cost.

1071
01:12:46,318 --> 01:12:47,406
Reimburse me?

1072
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,625
Come on, don't be an asshole.

1073
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:50,104
You know, I'm working
on paying back.

1074
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,279
How am I being an asshole?

1075
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:52,759
How am I, how am I
being an asshole?

1076
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:55,153
You owe me $20,000.

1077
01:12:55,196 --> 01:12:56,546
So I think you can tell me why

1078
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:58,461
I need to go get
this car detailed.

1079
01:12:58,504 --> 01:12:59,897
Trust me.

1080
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,289
You don't want to know.

1081
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,161
I don't deserve
to know that information?

1082
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:04,423
- Why?
- You can't

1083
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:06,164
know that information.

1084
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:09,297
But you still want my help, huh?

1085
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:12,083
Jason, why do you
always get yourself
