42
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
        I'm gonna become
        a nurse someday.

   the other on the screens.

47
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:59,104
   - Wow. What is this place?

48
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,707
   - The building was erected
      during the big boom.

49
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,976
        Assumption being
    industry drives growth.

50
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,045
Growth brings up demand for more
   affordable luxury housing.

51
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,993
   Imagine living in a place
 providing everything you need

52
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,028
    for a comfortable life.

53
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,230
   You'd never have to leave.

54
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:31,136
  And as you know, boom became
     bust, and here we are.

55
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,474
        - What a waste.

56
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,910
- You have to be careful here,
         Ms. Streak.

57
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,381

60

   plus a residential tower,
        30 floors high.

61
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,798
       As a patrol guard,
  you make sure nobody gets in

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,467
  nobody vandalizes the place,
      nothing bad happens

63
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,437
      to the structure...
  and nobody steals anything.

64
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,372
      -<i> Does that happen?</i>
        -<i> All the time.</i>

    Steal whatever they can
      get their hands on.

66
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,310
    We've been having issues
  of vagrancy, tryin' to make

67

    <i> the place into a squat,</i>
    <i> so don't let anyone in.</i>

68
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,348
This job pays well for a reason.

69
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,118
        The nights here
    can be long...and dark.

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,822
Some of the lights are on timer,
    so they turn off to save
           on power.

71
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,359
        The combination
 can make some people...uneasy.

72
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,329
      - I like the night.

73
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,931
  - We've blanketed the entire
 building with security cameras

74
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,833
  so we only need two guards.

75
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,768
 One on patrol and the other..

76
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,171
   - In front of the screens.
            Got it.

77
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,306
   Where's the control room?

78
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,674
          - Upstairs.

79
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,817
      I see your partner's
         already here.

80
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,253
     This is Dennis Cooper.

81
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,823
 He's been here since day one.

82
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,460
    - Hi. Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,196
    I'm Julia, but everybody
        calls me Streak.

84
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,198
        - That's great.

85
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,204
            - Nice.

     <i> Cooper will take you</i>
     <i> through the controls.</i>

87
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:16,174
    But I think you'll find
  the system pretty intuitive

88
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,744
    once you start using it.

89
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,879
      You'll go on patrol
     once every two hours.

90
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,115
Cooper will communicate with you

91
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,250
      using this headset.

       and a microphone.

93

95
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,896
         Simple enough?

96
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,866
Also, we've been having trouble
       with electricity.

97
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,567
      We lose a video feed
       from time to time

98
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,270
    so you'll have to throw
           a breaker.

99
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,571
           - Got it.

100
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,808
-<i> You know what a breaker is?</i>
            - Yup.

101
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,043
  - Don't forget the uniform.

102
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,312
That is the most important part
         of this job.

103
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,183
     - Have a great night.

104
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,318
    - There is a locker room
   in the back, to the right

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,687
   if you wanna change there.

106
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,125
Unless you feel more comfortable
    changing in here, which

107
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,263
     I could probably make
an exception for that...tonight.

108
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,632
         - I'm gonna go
      to the locker room.

109
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,634
            - Okay.

  - This place is really big.

114

      A person could spend
      a lifetime in here.

115
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,579
- Well, most people don't last
      more than a week.

116
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,290
      - What's your story?

117
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,226
       - What's my story?

118
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,696
   My story. Um, let me see.

119
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,498
   It's a very long, detailed

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,002
     richly...boring tale.

121
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,738
      However, let's start
    with tonight's chapter.

122
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,474
     I guess it starts out

123
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,377
that I'm sick and tired of Dixon

124
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,046

        <i> them all night.</i>

127
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,921
        That's my story.

128
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,392
'Cause tomorrow or the next day
  or possibly a week from now

129
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,961
but without question, it's going
 to happen, you're gonna decide

130
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,864
     that patrolling a big,
 empty building every two hours

131
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,432
 is not what was meant for you

132
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,801
         and your life
      and big aspirations.

133
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,736
    You're then gonna quit.

134
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,339
  Then Dixon's gonna bring in
  someone who's just like you

135
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,874
         and gonna sit
      right in that chair

136
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,208
         I'm gonna have
     the same conversation

137
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,412
    and be forced to babysit
     that person all night.

138
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,780
           - Really?

139
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,648
       - No tips, either.

140
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,350
       - This is gonna be
         a long night.

141
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,352
      - You have no idea.

142
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,422
       Sorry, sweetheart.

143
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,258
    Welcome to the big world
          of security.

   - It's weird. That happens
   every time I try to burp.

      Alright, we're just
   gonna stick with 24 then.

       talking to me now?

156

    - You don't understand.

696
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:03,839
    I have seen some things
      down there, Cooper.

697
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,675
 I have seen things down there.
    - You're gonna sit down.

00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:07,910
   You're not going anywhere.
           - Why not?

699
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,379

          out of here.

702
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:20,823
             - Why?
      - Because you're not
        thinking right.

703
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:22,291
Because you put me in jeopardy.

704
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,827
    Because I need this job.

705
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:27,529
   I don't have anywhere else
             to go!

00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,713
        - I'm so sorry.
          - Don't be.

712

00:54:57,928 --> 00:55:00,896

unless we shut the door, Cooper.

715
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,098
           - Or what,

716
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:06,869
       - I'm gonna do it.
         - Put it down.

718
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,572
        No, you're not,
 because it's just gonna prove

     gonna lose everything.
