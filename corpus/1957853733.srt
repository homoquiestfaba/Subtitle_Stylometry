1
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,239
He's doing the short set. Two Encores.

2
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,744
Maybe 12:15. Yeah, I have got to go.

3
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,178
Mr. Frank Sinatra, ladies and gentlemen!

4
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,239
Give me a cigarette! Yeah, you look...

5
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,246
Match me. There you go!

6
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,346
What? I'm sorry Frank.

7
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,357
There you go, Mister Sinatra!

8
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,953
Thanks, doll.

9
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,080
You know the basic difference
between men and women?

10
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,092
Women will ask for directions and men won't.

11
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,855
If you're with your man tonight, ladies,

12
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:52,668
and you get lost on the way home...

13
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,306
before he'll ask for directions,

14
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,707
you'll end up on Gilligan's Island.

15
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,537
Remember that show "Star Trek,"

16
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:00,939
all those guys in the spaceship?

17
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,115
"To go boldly where no man has ever gone."

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,673
They were lost.

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,116
Have a great show, Mr. Sinatra.

20
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,370
One thing you need to know about men:

21
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,747
Men are exactly like tile.

22
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,335
If you lay them right the first time,

23
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,300
you can walk all over them the rest of your life.

24
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,133
Hank, give me a splash of bourbon.

25
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,518
Give me a bourbon.

26
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,678
Here's some Mr. Jack for Mr. S.

27
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,821
There you are, Sir.

28
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,649
Here. Cancel that. I want some hot tea.

29
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,942
Yeah, you don't want,

30
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,019
Hot tea. Get him some tea, come on.

31
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,052
Tea, tea, tea.

32
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,053
No, cancel that. Give me the bourbon.

33
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,648
Give him the bourbon.

34
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,161
Here, forget the tea. Here's your bourbon, Frank.

35
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,348
Come here, you little prick.

36
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:51,268
Let me teach you something about show business.

37
00:03:55,574 --> 00:04:01,574
- Mister Sinatra?
<i>- I miss my guys.</i>

38
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:09,591
<i>- I miss my guys.</i>
- Ladies and gentlemen, my good friend...

39
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,217
and the chairman of the board,

40
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,720
Mr. Frank Sinatra!

41
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,358
You were great tonight, Torn.

68
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,440
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America
and all the ships at sea.

69
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,013
Let's go to press. News flash.

70
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,757
If you doubted Dean Martin can make it

71
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,892
without Jerry, cast that doubt aside.

72
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,185
Besides Martin's hit songs

73
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,548
and sold-out concert appearances...

74
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,999
his performance in "The Young Lions,"

75
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,384
as the happy-go-lucky dame chaser...

76
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,574
should do for him what

77
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,221
"From Here to Eternity" did for his pal...

78
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,160
perennial bad boy, Francis Albert.

79
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,370
With his top-ten hit,

80
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,821
"Memories Are Made of This"...

81
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,657
and number one smash, "Volare"...

82
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,326
it's safe to say Dino's a talent here to stay.

83
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,166
Whoa, Nelly. How did you all get in my room?

84
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,836
Dean, miss Jerry?

85
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,070
That question's so old, it's biblical, pal.

86
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,788
Here comes Dino.

87
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,181
Let him run to $20,000

88
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,801
and tell him to call home immediately.

89
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,091
Hey Charlie, mind if I take a whack?

90
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,190
Gather around, everybody.

91
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,204
Well, what do you know? A drink. For me'?

92
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,833
So, feeling lucky?

93
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,213
You'll excuse me while we
share a private moment here.

94
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,981
Hit me.

95
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,985
Twenty-six.

96
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,147
A winner.

97
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,151
My table. New rules, doll.

98
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,427
Excuse me, excuse me.

99
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,163
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Martin.

100
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,724
But Mr. Sinatra is on the phone.

101
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:47,475
Il Padrone himself.

102
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,060
Well, you tell him I'm busy.

103
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,395
He says it's urgent.

104
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,022
Frank was born urgent, pal.

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,026
You'll all excuse me. Nature calls.

106
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,922
Hey Dago! Is that you? What is it?

107
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,865
Dino, where have you been?

108
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,306
We've been looking all over for you.

109
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,918
Say hello to Momo and Hank.

110
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,186
Hey, what! Am I invisible?

111
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,058
Is that that other skinny Jew?

112
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,039
Where have you been?

113
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,366
Joey, fellas.

114
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,300
Good, how you doing, Dino?

115
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,703
Listen, Momo, I'm spreading

116
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,000
some of your wealth around here tonight.

117
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,139
Hey, zip it, cafone.

118
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,870
What, do you think we're on a golf course?

119
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,344
Hey Dean, did you get that
script that I sent you?

120
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,336
Oh uh, you mean "Hamlet"?

121
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:33,196
You know I don't look good in tights, Frank.

122
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,274
No, you idiot! "Some Came Running."

123
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,183
Don't make me spend three months
in Indiana by my lonesome, alright.

124
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,687
Listen, Dickie Bird...

125
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,972
my character's a card shark

126
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:43,185
with a taste for booze and broads.

127
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,715
That might be too much of a stretch.

128
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,127
Hey uh, Frank, no part for a brilliant comic

129
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,521
who never knows when to shut up?

130
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,392
Shut up.

131
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:51,598
All right, all right. Sorry.

132
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,130
Look, I'm not doing this without you.

133
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,135
That's all there is to it.

134
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,699
No listen to me. I sent the
wings for you tonight.

135
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,173
We're gonna be catching Sammy's
midnight show at Ciro's.

136
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,334
Well, You send it back Dag. I'm busy.

137
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,707
I've got a nice piece of braciole right here.

138
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,304
Besides, I've got my own show tomorrow night.

139
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,145
How can Sammy dance with one eye anyway?

140
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,480
Doesn't that mess with your whatchamacallit?

141
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,048
It's your equilibrium. 
Get me a splash of bourbon.

142
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,561
Yeah, sure Frank Yeah.

143
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:15,742
You know what. Cancel that, cancel that.

144
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:16,706
Forget the bourbon.

145
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,186
Listen, Dean, I got it all planned out.

146
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,160
You take the plane. We'll catch Sammy's show,

147
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,390
we'll grab some ring-a-ding...

148
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,707
we'll take the chopper to the Springs

149
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:23,659
for a midmorning clam bake...

150
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,918
and I'll have you back at the Oasis

151
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,061
by show time. It will be a gas!

152
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,660
Listen, Charlie, you are the
Eisenhower of the night...

153
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,919
but you gonna have to storm the

154
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,246
beaches without me this time.

155
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,248
Now, you give my love to the merry Negro.

156
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:34,374

157
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,334
I'll see you later, fellas.

159
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,305
See you later, Dino.

160
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,840
Can you believe him?

161
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,179
He's the only guy in the world
who could say no to me...

162
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,310
And I gotta tell your. I still love him.

163
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,275
Hey, hey, hey. I can say no to you.

164
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,266
I know, but I don't love you when you do.

165
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,084
But I still love you.

166
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:54,424
Come on, let's get out of here.

167
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,530
Bishop, you got a watch?

168
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,940

00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,941
Wow. Huh!

177
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,484
It is great to be back.

178
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:25,969
It's great to be back!

179
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,819
Umm...

180
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,405
There was a time, about four years ago...

181
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:30,573
after the accident, that I thought...

182
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,468
I might never perform for you again.

183
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,520
But the old man upstairs...

184
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,205
I guess wasn't through with me yet...

185
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,890
and I...

186
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,169
Thank you, thank you!

187
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,506
And, and there are some people who I...

188
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,715
I simply have to thank.

189
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,926
People without whose support I...

190
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,554
I would have curled up and died, baby.

191
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,931
There is Eddie Cantor...

192
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,416
the man who gave me my Star of David.

193
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,142
The only night I haven't worn it in five years,

194
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:59,252
was the night of the accident.

195
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,319
Eddie Cantor,

196
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,280
Eddie Cantor, ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,440
I love you, Sammy.

198
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,400
Thank you, Eddie.

199
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,401
Thank you man, from the bottom.

200
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,444
I mean that from the bottom.

201
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,224
And last, but never least...

202
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,830
a man who gave my pop and my uncle and I...

203
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,101
our first break a dozen or so years ago.

204
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,550
A man who got me gigs at clubs

205
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,173
that wouldn't have me in the audience...

206
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,169
until he got me a table there too.

207
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,672
A man who picked me up

208
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:31,092
when I was so very, very down.

209
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,182
My leader...

210
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,201
More importantly, my friend.

211
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,104
Mister Frank Sinatra.

212
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,042
I'm over here, Frank. Rank, I'm over here.

213
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,381
Sammy, let me ask you this:

214
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,099
How's your bird?

215
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,185
It was my eye Frank. It was my left eye.

216
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,963
Oh! Left eye. Sorry.

217
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,558
Thank God for that Sammy.

218
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,844
Because, eyes you know. We got two of them.

219
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:15,937
Yeah.

220
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,638
But when your bird can't fly,

221
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,615
you're Earthbound, baby.

222
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,602
Welcome back.

223
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,896
Sammy Davis Jr., ladies and gentlemen.

224
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,974
Frank, Frank. Come here, buddy.

225
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,228
Mr. Davis.

226
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:51,964
Mr. Davis!

227
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,677
Sorry to disturb you, but uh...

228
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,964
Frank thought you might like a little breakfast.

229
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,194
Look, George, I don't want to be uh...

230
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,209
Charlie-Ungrateful here or anything

231
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,979
but how about just a piece of rye toast?

232
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:09,023
Burnt. Ya know?

233
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,024
All right!

234
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,428
And George. Stop calling me Mr. Davis.

235
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,321
All right, baby?

236
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:16,906
All right.

237
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,466
Mr. Baby.

238
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,627
And, here on the second day of 1960...

239
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,301
Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy

240
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,802
has thrown his hat into the ring...

241
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,964
for the Democratic presidential nomination.

242
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,931
Momo up yet?

243
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:33,773
Not yet.

244
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,967
Wait. Come here, George.

245
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,593
Over here.

246
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:40,454
Senator, do you think it's really possible for a

247
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,889
Catholic Harvard man with a New England accent...

248
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,974
to win in the South?

249
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:44,475
No,

250
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,045
But whomever he is, I wish the poor fellow luck.

251
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,106
Apropos of that...

252
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:53,109
I just received this wire from my generous father

253
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,110
Bobby?

254
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,112
It reads as follows:

255
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,196
"Dear Jack."

256
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,649
"Don't buy a single vote more than is necessary."

257
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,243
"I'll be damned if I'm going
to pay for a landslide."

258
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,561
Yeah, you see?

259
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,329
You see. Now that's a big leaguer, George.

260
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:06,580
That's a big leaguer.

261
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:07,986
He knows exactly what everyone's thinking,

262
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:08,941
and what does he do?

263
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,456
He walks right into the lion's mouth,

264
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,486
and he pulls up a chair.

265
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,629
That's guts, baby. That's is guts!

266
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,064
Man, he's a playboy.

267
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:16,707
So what? So are you

268
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,008
What does that have to do with anything?

269
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,635
But, I ain't running for President.

270
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,431
Oh, Frank, em. Rocky Cooper called.

271
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,782
"The Crumb" is definitely coming
to her party on the 17th...

272
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,352
So I told her you would
decline the invite as usual.

273
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,690
Is he bringing his new bride?

274
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,524
Mrs. Patricia Kennedy Lawford.

275
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,942
I do believe she mentioned that as the main

276
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:38,279
reason she couldn't say no to the "The Crumb."

277
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,425
Call her back George.

278
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,452
Tell her I'm coming.

279
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,495
Whatever you say.

280
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:47,589
George...

281
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,542
Tell her I want to sit next to "Mrs. Crumb."

282
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,286
That ought to be something to see.

283
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,518
Thank you all very much. We'll see you again.

284
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,048
Yep.

285
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,501
Hello, bad boys.

286
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:18,494
Rocky. There she is.

287
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,955
I thought you'd never get here.

288
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,556
- How are you, doll?
- How are ya?

289
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:22,841
I brought my caddy.

290
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,967
I thought we'd play a few holes in your backyard.

291
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,803
Oh uh, what do you want to drinking?

292
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,155
Uh. Bourbon and coke.

293
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,432
Bourbon and water.

294
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,708
I don't mix my drinks political parties or races.

295
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,388
Right Sammy?

296
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,335
Yes, boss.

297
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:36,746
Oh, you are so rough and gruff.

298
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,138
I love that about you.

299
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:38,990
You do, do you?

300
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,925
You're beautiful.

301
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,435
Is Dean coming?

302
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,352
Oh you know he said he wanted to

303
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:45,096
stay home with the family, watch a western.

304
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,280
You know Dean.

305
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,682
Nobody knows Dean, Doll.

306
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,659
You said a mouthful. Who. who is that?

307
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:50,935
Who?

308
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:51,568
That.

309
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,705
The blond with the eyes and the shape and the...

310
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:54,422
Oh. Yum!

311
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,598
That's May Britt.

312
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,759
She was the girl in "The Young Lions" with Dean.

313
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,359
Hmm...

314
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,417
But, umm...

315
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,679
I don't think she's fast enough for you, Sammy.

316
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,281
Well, I'll limp, sweetheart.

317
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,866
Is she single?

318
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:06,434
Oh, she's single. But I warn you

319
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,344
she turns down everybody.

320
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:09,452
Including Dean.

321
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:11,021
Yes well, watch my smoke, Sweetheart.

322
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:12,248
All right, I'm watching.

323
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:13,456
Smokey!

324
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:14,291
Yeah?

325
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,226
Think taller.

326
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,903
Oh, good tip baby.

327
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,423
Nick! How have you been?

328
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:21,365
Rocky!

329
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,716
Rocky. Where's "The Crumb"?

330
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:23,885
I don't see "The Crumb".

331
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,368
Oh, his TV show is shooting late.

332
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,636
And stop calling him "The Crumb."

333
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,849
Peter's very charming, and he's a Democrat too.

334
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,688
Is that sister Kennedy?

335
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,443
Mrs. Peter Lawford.

336
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,737
How I've wanted to meet you, Frank.

337
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,767
It's a pleasure, sweetheart.

338
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,452
Oh, my God, he called me sweetheart.

339
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,329
Wait till I tell Jack.

340
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:52,997
Shall we have a seat?

341
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:55,373
Thank you.

342
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,183
Rocky?

343
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,506
Excuse me, Miss Britt...

344
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:03,441
Tell me.

345
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,217
Tell you?

346
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,572
Well, you're beautiful. I'll tell you that much.

347
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,722
My name is Sammy...

348
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,073
Sammy Davis, Jr. I know.

349
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,935
I saw your Broadway show, "Mr. Wonderful."

350
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,395
It was the most amazing thing I ever see.

351
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,005
Is that right, "see"?

352
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,314
No, actually, it's saw.

353
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,025
Ah yes, I get my tensions confused.

354
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:22,866
Oh, that's all right.

355
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,737
I get tense too from time to time, baby.

356
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,069
Do you call everybody baby?

357
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:29,951
Well, It's easier than remembering
all these cuckoo names.

358
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,543
My name is May.

359
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,795
It's spelled "May," but it's pronounced "My."

360
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,046
Can you remember that?

361
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:43,939
Yes.

362
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,344
Every time I see you, I'll think, "My, oh, my."

363
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,983
Jack's your biggest fan, you know.

364
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,342
He loves all those...

365
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,610
What do you call it? Those...

366
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,946
Oh, your "Frankenslang." That's it.

367
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,072
What is that anyway?

368
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,891
All those delicious words you use?

369
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,151
It's just a way of saying what you want to say...

370
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,744
when you don't want the stiffs who

371
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:15,317
run things to know what you're saying.

372
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,272
That's all.

373
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,666
It's just a way of being naughty.

374
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,466
No.

375
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,792
No wonder Jack said you're the one man...

376
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,553
in the world he'd like to trade places with.

377
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:25,646
[Whispers] Excuse me.

378
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,800
Really?

379
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:27,566
Hmm.

380
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,302
Huh? Well.

381
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:32,830
Nice to see you again.

382
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:35,641
Peter, Darling, you made it.

383
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,519
Darling, I'm so sorry...

384
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:39,662
So sorry I'm late.

385
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,944
There's this rather bad actress at the studio.

386
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,846
She keeps forgetting her lines. Hello, Darling.

387
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,068
And you know. So they keep on...

388
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,282
Oh my God!

389
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:55,952
How could you do this? This is... That's Frank.

390
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,455
He's sitting there with my wife.

391
00:19:57,555 --> 00:19:58,789
Now, just take it easy.

392
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,000
Think he's nervous?

393
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:02,376
Come on.

394
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:04,587
Everybody knows about you, Frank and Ava.

395
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:05,737
It's old news.

396
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:06,559
What do you mean, everyone knows?

397
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:07,852
There's nothing for anyone to know.

398
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,324
Which is why nobody knows anything.

399
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,217
They know nothing.

400
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,801
The studio set up a dinner,

401
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:14,429
and a photo was taken, and that's it.

402
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,197
That's it.

403
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,646
Peter, just pull yourself together.

404
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,483
No, I can't do this.

405
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,936
The last time I spoke with Frank,

406
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,439
he threatened to have my legs broken.

407
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:27,991
He's in with those you-know-who.

408
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,511
He's a madman. He's a madman!

409
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,489
But, that was years ago.

410
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,990
Frank, I mean, has matured.

411
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,950
He was carrying Ava's baggage then.

412
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:37,561
And he was nearly suicidal.

413
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:38,621
Yeah! "Nearly"?

414
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,499
Well, they weren't serious attempts.

415
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,409
Miss, shall I recount the gory details?

416
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,294
Oh no, please don't!

417
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:45,235
Because they were gory!

418
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:46,245
Please don't!

419
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,400
Hello, old chap.

420
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,300
Hi!

421
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:53,819
How are you?

422
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,804
Peter, how you doing?

423
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,013
Nice to see you, Darling.

424
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:57,381
Hello, sweetheart.

425
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:58,772
Guess who I've been talking to?

426
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,667
Yeah.

427
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,435
I don't speak to your old man, you know.

428
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:02,560
Yes, I know.

429
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,871
He's very scared of you.

430
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,715
But that's changed since I married him.

431
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,365
I've transformed him.

432
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,109
Into what?

433
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,110
Into a Kennedy, of course.

434
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:11,096
Nah, hah, hah, hah, hah!

435
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,321
I wouldn't leave this woman alone too often.

436
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,406
Peter.

437
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,375
She's got a way with words.

438
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,285
She certainly does, Frank.

439
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:25,668
I think we should go have a talk.

440
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,894
Sure.

441
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,254
Excuse me. Won't you Pat?

442
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,064
Of course.

443
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:30,972
Rocky?

444
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:31,866
Of course.

445
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:34,885
Excuse us, Darling.

446
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,673
After you, Frank. Please, I insist.

447
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,207
Peter...

448
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,116
Sure.

449
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,566
What is it about that man?

450
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,841
Oh, you want to fuck him.

451
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,744
You want to mother him.

452
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,862
You...

453
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:55,089
Don't want to piss him off!

454
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:56,991
Oh God, is it a combination?

455
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,660
You know, when I first met Joe Kennedy...

456
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,338
He told me that I possess the two qualities

457
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:04,707
that he most despised in a man.

458
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,167
I'm an actor...

459
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,044
And I'm, I'm English.

460
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,089
Well, you obviously charmed him, Cyril.

461
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,424
Ooh, not really.

462
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,977
You know. He hired a spy who told him that...

463
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,261
I had this certain penchant

464
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,163
for ladies, young ladies that come for...

465
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:19,997
How should I put it?

466
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:21,290
A price?

467
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,870
Yeah, a very reasonable price, Frank.

468
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,735
I'm sure. You always were tight, Cyril.

469
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:25,769
So what happened?

470
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,438
Well, he was so overjoyed that I wasn't a Poof

471
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,122
that he welcomed me

472
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:30,574
whole heartedly into the family.

473
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,484
Which has its perks, apart from

474
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,655
their predisposition to die
in tragic circumstances.

475
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,657
Sins of the father, no doubt.

476
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,535
I want to help Jack get elected.

477
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:43,461
Lest we wind up with another stuffed shirt.

478
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,996
This country needs some shaking up.

479
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,624
And I don't mean by Elvis.

480
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,799
Is that why you're talking to me?

481
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,669
Pete, don't be so insecure, okay?

482
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,340
I've always liked you.

483
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,217
You just crossed me.

484
00:22:57,077 --> 00:23:00,763
That time with Ava... It wasn't a date, Frank.

485
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:01,984
I swear to God, it was just...

486
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,390
Nah, don't bring God into it.

487
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,059
He's disappointed in both of us.

488
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,319
I'm an 18-carat manic depressive.

489
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,495
You know that.

490
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,990
I overreacted, a little.

491
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,447
I do miss her, though.

492
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,827
The insanity.

493
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,772
All of it, believe it or not.

494
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,626
I just can't seem to let go.

495
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,211
Maybe because you can't let go

496
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,297
of what you never really had, huh Cyril?

497
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,882
Yeah.

498
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,280
So you want to have some fun?

499
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:42,763
Yeah.

500
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,851
Help me put your brother-in-law

501
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,123
in the White House.

502
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,279
I mean. What else is there for a skinny wop

503
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:48,924
like me to accomplish in this world, huh?

504
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:50,771
I can't think of anything, Frank.

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:12,679
<i>♫ Kennedy. He just keeps rolling along. ♫</i>

539
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:19,879
Beautiful.

540
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,213
Thank you. Thank you.

541
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:25,768
Shut up already. Shut up!

542
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,182
It's time to get serious for a moment.

543
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,882
Oh, there's my cue. Good night, all.

544
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,515
Get back here, Dean. Get right back here!

545
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,309
Look. There's a reason why we're all here tonite.

546
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:35,561
You threatened us.

547
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,022
Did he threaten you too, Sammy?

548
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,195
Um, I refuse to answer that on the grounds

549
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,943
that it might incinerate me, baby.

550
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,300
Don't you mean "incriminate" you?

551
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,568
Oh Baby! Once you've been incinerated...

552
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,200
you don't care if you gets incriminated.

553
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,997
Do you see why I want to get into politics?

554
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,510
I can't have a serious conversation

555
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,541
with these two bums.

556
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:00,910
Seriously, folks, we're gathered here tonight...

557
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,251
to raise money for a man that I met briefly...

558
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:06,588
when I sang at the Democratic convention in 1956.

559
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,254
He gave a speech that night.

560
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,569
And, let me tell you something.

561
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:12,651
When you hear Jack Kennedy speak.

562
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:13,782
You don't forget it.

563
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:15,850
So I don't have to say too much

564
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,189
about why I think he should be the next

565
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,579
President of the United States.

566
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:20,314
He can take care of that just fine.

567
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:21,390
Thank you very much!

568
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,252
It's an honor for me to introduce to you...

569
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:27,916
the senator from the great

570
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:29,031
state of Massachusetts...

571
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,058
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

572
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:32,201
Jack, come on up here.

573
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:33,827
Jack Kennedy, everybody!

574
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,891
Thank you.

575
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,602
And a special thanks to you
Frank, for arranging this.

576
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,357
It's an honor to be on the same stage with you.

577
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:01,330
With all of you.

578
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:04,483
Good evening!

579
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,151
My name is John Kennedy.

580
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,111
Jackie Bouvier's husband.

581
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,366
Unfortunately, she couldn't be here tonight...

582
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,159
But I want to be sure that I uh...

583
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,244
Get all your autographs.

584
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:16,912
So I can prove that I was really here.

585
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:19,318
Ladies and gentlemen...

586
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:22,668
we live in extraordinary times.

587
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,879
Times of great promise and great peril.

588
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,549
In Chinese, the word "crisis"

589
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:30,342
is composed of two characters.

590
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:32,094
One represents danger.

591
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,720
The other opportunity.

592
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:34,863
Look at him.

593
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,578
He's got them in the palm of his hands.

594
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,716
I love this guy.

595
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,563
Take a peek at Marilyn, Pally!

596
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:43,738
She gets any more humid,

597
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:45,357
we're all gonna need umbrellas.

598
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,943
Look at DiMaggio.

599
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:50,857
Lifetime "325" Center Fielder for the Yankees...

600
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,489
and now he's Charlie-Ball-Boy.

601
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,032
Different league, buster. Different league.

602
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,076
A world full of problems
calls for greater leadership

603
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:59,913
and vision in the control of nuclear weapons.

604
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:01,957
The utter destruction!

605
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:03,737
Which would result from their use in war...

606
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,420
Are the real issues that face us today.

607
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:20,442
I'm the one trying to stay on the up-and-up here.

608
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:23,687
What about when you got hit with the pie?

609
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:25,605
The fella says what's the point of power

610
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:26,898
if you don't abuse people?

611
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:27,958
You know that one.

612
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,476
I remember that. I remember that.

613
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:30,944
I was in the bathroom.

614
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,445
He gets it right in the eye. He can't see it.

615
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:33,732
He can't see it.

616
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:36,558
Do you serve uh...

617
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:38,452
Southern Italian food at your place, Joe?

618
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:39,803
Sure.

619
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,164
When they would say "four balls"

620
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,584
Joe would think they were talking
about meatballs, usually.

621
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:46,884
But if it's Northern Italian food that

622
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,005
you're interested in Jack...

623
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:50,089
You have to go north. San Francisco.

624
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:52,132
One of the little ironies of living in L.A.

625
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,884
I feel a punch line coming.

626
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,552
Why is that, Dean?

627
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:59,081
Because Frank has outlawed it.

628
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,099
No, that's not true.

629
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,377
I'm not sure that's proper
use of your power, Frank.

630
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,102
I think we'll have to get my brother here

631
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,021
to ah, launch an investigation.

632
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:08,123
Shalom!

633
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:11,777
What do you say, Bobby?

634
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,571
Well, uh. Seeing as how I share...

635
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:16,431
Frank's passion for Southern Italian food...

636
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,492
I, I ah... See no need to authorize

637
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:20,160
an investigation at this time.

638
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:22,471
Dodged a bullet. Cheers!

639
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,705
All right brother Bobby.

640
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,207
Let's hear it for brother Bobby!

641
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,124
I'll drink to that!

642
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,377
He'll drink to anything.

643
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,089
Watch this, Jack. If you...

644
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:37,489
Now if Momo would show up,
we'd have a full house.

645
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,604
Hey Buddy Boy!

646
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,640
Politicians, movie stars, mobsters.

647
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,774
Untouchables.

648
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:45,268
All the bacteria you need for life itself.

649
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:50,816
Well. Look who we have here.

650
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,317
Hey, Mickey!

651
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,928
I see you cleaned Bugsy's blood off your shirt.

652
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:57,781
Is that a Cuban cigar in your hand by any chance?

653
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,549
Mickey Cohen.

654
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,411
And Johnny Roselli.

655
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,645
Well, well!

656
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:07,374
Where Johnny is, can Momo be far behind?

657
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,869
I'll tell you what to do with it.

658
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:12,170
What is this, Tony?

659
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,022
It's a private party, Tony.

660
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,197
Turn around and look at the man.

661
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:16,274
No, please.

662
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:19,840
Right this way.

663
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,141
I love the bubbles.

664
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,564
Thank you, everyone!

665
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:32,888
But I'm afraid we're expected somewhere else.

666
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,042
We are?

667
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:34,843
Yeah.

668
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,903
We have that thing. Remember?

669
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,129
Well...

670
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:39,948
I'm not leaving.

671
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:42,033
I'm having fun.

672
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:47,689
Don't contradict me in front of everybody.

673
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:48,857
Let's just go.

674
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,001
Are you still my husband?

675
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,961
I thought I had a new one.

676
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,212
What's his name?

677
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,858
You know, the one who wrote "Death of a Mailman."

678
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,861
You know. I think it's about time I...

679
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:07,668
rolled on out of here myself.

680
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:08,542
Married life.

681
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:10,187
You know what I'm talking about, Fellas.

682
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:11,480
Why it's uh...

683
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,607
It's fairly late in the game for me too.

684
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,549
Well, by the way Joe, listen.

685
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,568
Why don't you uh...

686
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,896
Explain to me about that infield fly rule.

687
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:20,572
I never could quite understand that.

688
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:23,950
Listen, don't embarrass yourself, Chump.

689
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,285
Let Frank handle it, okay?

690
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,663
I'll get the car.

691
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,583
Sweetheart, you should leave with Joe.

692
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,683
You're gonna regret it tomorrow if you don't.

693
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,070
He isn't my husband anymore.

694
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,321
He's just a fuddy-duddy.

695
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,339
I know, but he's an Italian fuddy-duddy.

696
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,108
And you're making him lose face, Sweetheart.

697
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,178
Come on. Okay?

698
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:46,515
You're right, Frankie. Thanks.

699
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,312
Jack

700
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:54,770
I'm sorry for the embarrassment.

701
00:32:54,841 --> 00:32:56,858
Marilyn, please. Don't even think about it.

702
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,068
It was a pleasure.

703
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,546
You too, Bobby.

704
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:02,697
Bye! Sammy.

705
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:03,757
All right!

706
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:04,682
Here you go, sweetheart.

707
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:05,275
Thanks!

708
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:06,184
Good night.

709
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:18,247
Bye.

710
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,895
I don't want to be Charlie-Trembles here...

711
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,962
But uh, why don't you go out ahead of me?

712
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:25,517
There may be photographers out there.

713
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,630
I don't care.

714
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,539
Shhhh!

715
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,516
Your studio does mind, all right?

716
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,059
Dean will take you home and then

717
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,959
I'll swing by your place a little later. Huh?

718
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:36,064
My God.

719
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,524
Would you look at that.

720
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,842
These guys can screw anybody.

721
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,211
Anybody they want.

722
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:43,416
Make sure you give him my number, will you Peter?

723
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,206
Of course I will.

724
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:44,973
Thank you!

725
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:45,931
You promise?

726
00:33:45,932 --> 00:33:47,826
Greatest ass, in the history of the world.

727
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,161
It's laid out for them on a plate.

728
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,247
Like a deli spread.

729
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,163
Good night, Joe. Take care.

730
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,795
Hi. Judy Campbell. I'm here to see Frank.

731
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:12,601
Hello Chickie baby!

732
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,811
It's just you, me and the girl scouts.

733
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:17,480
Your place or mine?

734
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,107
We'll go to my place.

735
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:20,545
You can have the presidential suite.

736
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,276
How's that?

737
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:22,672
They're not just gonna

738
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:24,397
hand me the keys to the White House, Frank.

739
00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:25,342
If I want to get to Nixon...

740
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:26,781
I have to step over Humphrey first.

741
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,618
Jack, let me tell you something!

742
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:31,603
No one named Hubert will ever be president.

743
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,749
It's like in the movies.

744
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,640
Except you're going up for the part of president.

745
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,360
Now, having done a couple of movies myself,

746
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,838
I can tell you that Edward G. Robinson

747
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,590
doesn't play Gary Cooper parts.

748
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:45,825
He plays Edward G. Robinson parts.

749
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,519
He plays the bad guy, he's the shady guy.

750
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,054
See, he doesn't play the hero.

751
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,401
You're going to be going toe-to-toe...

752
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:52,986
with Richard Nixon for the romantic lead

753
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,935
in a movie called "Presidential Politics."

754
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:56,519
Who do you think will get the girl?

755
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,455
Huh? Right here.

756
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,624
Speaking of which...

757
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,820
Which one do you want?

758
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:08,984
Or do you want both of them?

759
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:11,868
I know him well.

760
00:35:12,702 --> 00:35:13,670
Really well.

761
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:15,842
Who's the one who looks like Elizabeth Taylor?

762
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,166
Yeah! I had a feeling. That's Judy Campbell.

763
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,477
She looks like Elizabeth Taylor, only better.

764
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,661
You don't have to marry her to sleep with her.

765
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,503
Life is good.

766
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:39,604
Hello?

767
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,381
What, Bobby?

768
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,457
What's wrong?

769
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:44,109
It's 5:00 A.M.

770
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:47,020
I'm just uh... I'm getting up.

771
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,229
Wait a minute.

772
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,590
Bobby?

773
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:52,617
Can I call you back, Bobby?

774
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:53,410
I ah...

775
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:55,628
Well, it's Marilyn.

776
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:57,497
She came over at about 3:00 this morning...

777
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,165
in a state that... hang on!

778
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:00,667
Can only be described as shaky.

779
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:01,876
And uh...

780
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:04,045
I've been up all night, you see.

781
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:07,716
Yeah, she's quite a handful. Uh hmm!

782
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:10,719
No! No I haven't slept with her.

783
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,513
But I do hear that she's overrated.

784
00:36:13,807 --> 00:36:15,557
What? Hoodlums?

785
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:19,269
Oh, Mickey Cohen? Uh, yeah.

786
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:22,522
Yeah but, Puccini's.

787
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,315
Uh-huh.

788
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:25,734
So what?

789
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:27,735
It's a restaurant Bobby!

790
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:30,071
Frank doesn't control whoever goes to...

791
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:31,322
I...Yeah, well.

792
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,383
I'll do anything for the family, Bobby.

793
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:36,545
You know that! But I can't just go... Ah, yeah!

794
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,305
All right, I'll see what I can do then, Bobby.

795
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,879
Fucking Kennedys!

796
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,400
Yeah, exactly!

797
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:52,394
No, no, no, no, no!

798
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:54,387
I got you down for 10 thousand dollars.

799
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,849
Jeanne, what do you mean five?

800
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,894
Hey uh. You said $10,000, Jeanne.

801
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:02,503
Don't! Don't!

802
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:03,919
Don't give me that Catholic crap, alright.

803
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:05,688
Any other candidate. Yes, I would agree...

804
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:07,484
But, Kennedy is rewriting the rule books.

805
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:08,257
Jeanne I'm telling you.

806
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:09,102
Good morning, George.

807
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:10,249
Good morning Miss Campbell.

808
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,214
Hold on. Morning, Judy!

809
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,323
Good morning!

810
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:14,199
Is he up yet?

811
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,284
Oh, he's up, all right.

812
00:37:17,938 --> 00:37:19,120
Jeanne, all right look!

813
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,597
I'm putting you down for $10,000.

814
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:21,643
I want you to make the check out to...

815
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:22,682
the Kennedy Campaign.

816
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:25,267
Yes, yeah!.

817
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:27,194
I promise you a front row
seat at the inauguration.

818
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:28,629
How's that? Okay, Thanks!

819
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,548
Good morning!

820
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,549
Good morning Cyril!

821
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:32,692
How's your bird?

822
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,346
Gentlemen, the bird has flown!

823
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:40,358
We should go up to Sun Valley Frank.

824
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,559
Go skiing.

825
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:44,896
Jack, just had a little chat...

826
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,731
with you-know-who this morning.

827
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,608
And...

828
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:49,965
Pat's out of town next month.

829
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,444
Thought we might uh...

830
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:53,071
have a little clam bake at the beach.

831
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,281
Can you make the campaign stop?

832
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:56,878
Well, what about the center fielder?

833
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:59,052
Ah! Is he coming out of retirement?

834
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,245
It looked like he was.

835
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,788
He dropped the ball.

836
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:04,648
Well then. Let's circle the bases.

837
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,625
There you go.

838
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:07,318
Good idea!

839
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,903
Wait, wait, wait! George. Are you hungry, Jack?

840
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,964
You know... Get Jack the house special.

841
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,189
Oh, and George!

842
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,843
And tell him how you feel about civil rights.

843
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,221
He's gonna be president. He should know.

844
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,373
It doesn't matter what I think.

845
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,600
Why is that, George?

846
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:23,893
Because...

847
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:24,852
It doesn't matter what

848
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:26,396
the Negro thinks in this country.

849
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:29,390
I mean, the few who do vote are all tied up

850
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,151
with those Democratic machines in the north.

851
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:34,674
Hell, they'd vote for Adolf Hitler in Chicago...

852
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:36,447
if Mayor Daley told them to.

853
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:39,033
And senator, no politician can win

854
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,869
in the south if he offends old Jim Crow.

855
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,320
Even if he did. The Negro still

856
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,039
can't vote down there anyway, can he?

857
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:48,877
You may be right, George.

858
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:52,625
I'll be sure to share your feelings...

859
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:55,134
with Martin Luther King next time I see him.

860
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,594
If you get in office, Senator...

861
00:38:57,694 --> 00:38:59,512
you won't have to ask him.

862
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,598
He'll tell you.

863
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,560
Thanks George!

864
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,759
Hello, Frank.

865
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:38,851
Ready for lunch?

866
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:42,055
Yeah. Look at this. Whoo! Whoo!

867
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:44,183
A little business.

868
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:46,826
Not that I want to impose on our

869
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:48,728
relationship in any way. But I um...

870
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:49,770
Is it any good?

871
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:50,487
What's that?

872
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,439
Your script, Cyril.

873
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,483
It's wonderful! The script's wonderful Frank.

874
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:55,691
I bought the rights from a friend of mine and...

875
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,362
Just happens to be a part for you.

876
00:39:58,171 --> 00:39:59,947
You know I can't. Uh...

877
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,763
I can't get arrested in
features these days Frank.

878
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:04,203
But there's a devilishly good part for you in it.

879
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,745
And for Dean too, and Sammy even,

880
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:08,599
if the studio doesn't mind.

881
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,399
I am the studio, Cyril.

882
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,311
You certainly are the studio, Frank.

883
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:13,168
What's it called?

884
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:14,329
It's called "Ocean's Eleven."

885
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:16,047
Lousy title, but leave it. I'll read it.

886
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:20,051
Yeah, it's a lousy title. But you'll read it?

887
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,842
Yeah.

888
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:24,097
Thanks! You know, I really appreciate this.

889
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:27,388
You know, I think it's wonderful that...

890
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:28,434
Knock it off.

891
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:29,352
Right.

892
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,371
I owe you, Peter.

893
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,166
You're doing me a favor, and I appreciate it.

894
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:35,998
You're giving me a chance to change my image.

895
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,351
Yeah, wait till the God Damn press sees me

896
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,872
in the White House with the president.

897
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:40,771
That will shut those Son's of Bitches up.

898
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,698
Right.

899
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:45,076
Um, speaking of your image.

900
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,911
Just that Bobby mentioned that...

901
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:53,418
he saw Mickey Cohen eating at Puccini's.

902
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,937
So?

903
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,253
Is there any law against eating spaghetti?

904
00:40:58,258 --> 00:40:59,799
Exactly what I said.

905
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:03,845
But he... He mentioned it.

906
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:06,597
Don't squirm Peter.

907
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:07,824
I hate it when you squirm.

908
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:10,668
Thank you.

909
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,703
Yeah. Right.

910
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,313
Jack uh, you know. I mean it's just...

911
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:16,799
Jack is just so vulnerable to... Hoover.

912
00:41:16,899 --> 00:41:18,901
Who hates the Kennedys with a passion.

913
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:19,744
Bordering on...

914
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,654
I never apologize for my friends.

915
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:23,990
Not even you.

916
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,991
Thank you. Thank you.

917
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:27,075
When I was flat on my ass a few years ago...

918
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:28,276
guys like Johnny and Momo were

919
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:29,685
the only ones who would give me a job.

920
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,187
And believe me...

921
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:31,622
I wasn't packing them in back then.

922
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:32,523
Absolutely.

923
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:33,566
Open your eyes Peter.

924
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,192
Jack's a bootlegger's son

925
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,597
who likes to fuck them two at a time.

926
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,182
If that fruitcake in the F.B.l. wanted to

927
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:39,525
do something, he'd have done it by now.

928
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,172
Don't you think?

929
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:40,922
Right.

930
00:41:40,923 --> 00:41:41,757
Well?

931
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:43,967
Oh yes, and before I forget...

932
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:48,213
Eh, Bobby also mentioned, He mentioned that

933
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,274
you were going to hire a writer called

934
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,143
Albert Maltz...to write a script for you.

935
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,021
Yes, I'm hiring Albert Maltz.

936
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,607
So what? He's a great screenwriter

937
00:41:58,051 --> 00:42:00,818
But he's a Communist. Isn't he blacklisted?

938
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:03,571
Albert Maltz is just a screenwriter. That's it.

939
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:05,530
He thought the country was giving the

940
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:07,125
working man a raw deal 30 years ago.

941
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:08,993
Who didn't? So did Ronald Reagan.

942
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,579
Kirk Douglas is using Trumbo for "Spartacus."

943
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,401
If he can do it. You don't think I can Peter.

944
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,592
Uh yeah. Kirk Douglas

945
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:17,877
isn't a presidential candidate's friend.

946
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,129
He's not Jack Kennedy's friend.

947
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,840
You see... You get my drift?

948
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:25,509
Stand up, Peter!

949
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,602
Why?

950
00:42:26,603 --> 00:42:27,845
I said stand up.

951
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,098
Right.

952
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:32,600
How tall are you?

953
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,659
Six foot two.

954
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:35,770
Don't cut yourself off at the knees.

955
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:41,192
The brouhaha over Sinatra's hiring of

956
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:43,151
blacklisted screen writer Albert Maltz to write

957
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:45,320
the film vehicle of
"The Execution of Private Slovik"

958
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:48,883
escalated today as actor John
Wayne spoke out against Sinatra.

959
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:51,576
Wayne said, I quote "I wonder how Sinatra's

960
00:42:51,577 --> 00:42:52,994
crony, Senator John Kennedy,

961
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:54,580
feels about him hiring such a man."

962
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,706
"I'd like to know his attitude because he's the

963
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,008
one that was making plans to run

964
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,961
the government of our great country.”

965
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,129
I got some things in the trunk.

966
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,464
Brian, if you would, please.

967
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:06,925
Ambassador Kennedy's in the study.

968
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:07,517
Great.

969
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,678
Sinatra bought full-page ads in the trades which

970
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,813
state quote " I do not ask the senator for advice

971
00:43:11,814 --> 00:43:13,732
on whom I should hire, and he doesn't ask me

972
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:15,058
how he should vote in the Senate."

973
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,185
I hire the best man for the job, and I am

974
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:18,937
prepared to await the verdict of the American

975
00:43:18,938 --> 00:43:20,439
people when they see the picture.

976
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,278
”Well, there he is. Had a nice ride?

977
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,363
It was perfect, Ambassador. Thank you.

978
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:28,997
I brought you some fresh Italian bread

979
00:43:28,998 --> 00:43:30,307
and some other delectables.

980
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,910
Marvelous. Jack Daniels still your drink?

981
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,044
You've done your homework. Yes, Sir.

982
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,080
Jack Daniels for Mr. Sinatra.

983
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:40,150
I understand you and Jack have been

984
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:41,711
having a nice time together.

985
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,588
Oh, we've had a few laughs.

986
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:45,314
How much have you heard?

987
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,215
Enough.

988
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:48,468
[Frank laughs nervously]

989
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:49,760
Frank!

990
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:50,511
Yes, Sir.

991
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:51,929
About this Maltz fellow...

992
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:54,563
I'm too old to beat around the bush...

993
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:55,808
So I'll come right out with it.

994
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:58,852
I admire your courage, but if you don't fire him

995
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,937
I'm afraid you can't continue to

996
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,565
associate yourself with the campaign.

997
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:05,525
It's bad enough Jack gets banged around for being

998
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:08,738
a Catholic. He can't be pro-Communist too.

999
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,825
Ambassador, Albert Maltz is not a Communist.

1000
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:14,410
He's a screenwriter.

1001
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:16,953
He's a Jew who sits in front
of typewriter all day

1002
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,123
and doesn't get enough sun. That's it.

1003
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,083
He's history.

1004
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:26,087
I already made a commitment to him.

1005
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:27,298
You made a mistake.

1006
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,466
The bigger the man, the bigger the mistake.

1007
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:32,145
That's all. Just pay him off and do what

1008
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:34,514
you have to do to save face. But do it!

1009
00:44:34,697 --> 00:44:37,641
Marilyn Monroe could have sex with every opinion

1010
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,684
maker in the country, and it wouldn't make a

1011
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:42,330
difference if they think Jack is soft on Commies.

1012
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:45,091
I understand.

1013
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:49,779
Now, there's another matter.

1014
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,865
I need a favor.

1015
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:57,537
I thought you just asked for one.

1016
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,163
Well, that was a favor to you.

1017
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:01,374
This one's for me.

1018
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,459
We need Humphrey out of the race and the only way

1019
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,505
to do that is to smash him in the West Virginia.

1020
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:09,256
Jack won Wisconsin.

1021
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:12,385
But he was waxed in all four Protestant districts

1022
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,821
Know much about West Virginia, Frank?

1023
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:22,027
Coal miners and canaries. That's all I know.

1024
00:45:22,028 --> 00:45:23,295
And Protestants, Frank.

1025
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:25,397
Millions of them. Ninety-five percent.

1026
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:28,108
We lose there, and our opponents in both

1027
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:30,902
parties will say a Catholic can't win the south,

1028
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:33,281
and Jack won't get the nomination.

1029
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,468
But it's critically important for Jack to

1030
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:37,496
get the support of the state's political machine.

1031
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:39,745
The Teamsters will never endorse Jack.

1032
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:43,202
Not after Bobby's witch-hunts. They won't.

1033
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:45,041
Perhaps not publicly, no.

1034
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,838
Are we on the same wavelength?

1035
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:53,009
I'm a saloon singer, but I'm not stupid.

1036
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:54,926
Let me get this straight, what you're saying

1037
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:56,804
is you know Jack can't win West Virginia.

1038
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,055
And, you want me to go to my friends

1039
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,182
and make sure he does.

1040
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,561
Right?

1041
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:08,065
They must realize there's no direct quid pro quo.

1042
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:10,568
Jack can't be beholden to these people.

1043
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:13,321
It will have to be a favor they do for you.

1044
00:46:14,474 --> 00:46:15,906
And, to an extent, for me.

1045
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:30,963
I got it. Just get in the car and drive.

1046
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:36,968
News flash. Finally bowing to pressure

1047
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,261
from within and without Hollywood,

1048
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,971
Frank Sinatra instructed his attorneys

1049
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:41,532
to pay writer Albert Maltz in full, and

1050
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:43,817
inform him that he will not write the screenplay,

1051
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:46,101
for "The Execution of Private Slovik" after all.

1052
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:47,854
When asked, Sinatra said, quote

1053
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:50,190
"'I have defended my hiring of Mr. Maltz"

1054
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:52,360
but the American public has indicated otherwise.

1055
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:55,446
And I will accept this majority opinion.

1056
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,282
Sinatra issued no other public statement.

1057
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,242
Have you talked with him?

1058
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:03,286
Listen Honey. The reason Frankie and I get along

1059
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,289
so well, is we try to keep it light.

1060
00:47:05,525 --> 00:47:08,376
We talk about music, golf, movies.

1061
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,168
Nice and simple.

1062
00:47:10,169 --> 00:47:12,712
Well, if you don't talk to Frank, then

1063
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:15,291
who do you share your
intimate feelings with, Dean?

1064
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,384
Mind me asking?

1065
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:18,885
Jeanne, to share intimate feelings,

1066
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:20,805
you have to have intimate feelings.

1067
00:47:25,046 --> 00:47:26,810
Dinner's almost ready.

1068
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:28,474
Save me a seat.

1069
00:47:55,515 --> 00:47:56,382
How are you, Momo?

1070
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:57,775
Don't you ever sleep?

1071
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:00,136
No!

1072
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,265
So?

1073
00:48:07,795 --> 00:48:08,614
Have you thought about what we

1074
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:09,899
talked about on the golf course?

1075
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:11,397
I thought about it.

1076
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,299
Tell me...

1077
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:16,485
who's the doll that looks like Elizabeth Taylor?

1078
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,072
That's Judy Campbell.

1079
00:48:20,248 --> 00:48:21,240
Judy!

1080
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:23,409
This is Sam Flood.

1081
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:25,161
This is Judy Campbell.

1082
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:26,549
Hi, Sam.

1083
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:29,957
She looks like Liz Taylor.

1084
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,792
But you don't have to marry her to fuck her.

1085
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:35,045
You want a drink?

1086
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:36,222
Certainly.

1087
00:48:36,964 --> 00:48:37,923
No ice.

1088
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:43,345
I see you're wearing the ring.

1089
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,306
I always wear the ring.

1090
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:46,557
That's not what I heard.

1091
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,100
I heard you weren't wearing it.

1092
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:50,101
You know, I gave you the ring

1093
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:51,520
as a symbol of lifelong friendship.

1094
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:54,106
Then I heard you weren't wearing it, Momo.

1095
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:55,811
Hey! I said I was wearing the ring.

1096
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:57,777
What, are you turning homo all of a sudden?

1097
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:59,361
Give me a break, for Chrissake.

1098
00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:03,365
Frankie.

1099
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:06,076
Let's get down to it.

1100
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,579
Tell me, why should I do that Ivy League playboy

1101
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,540
and his Irish fuck father a favor?

1102
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,451
Look at it this way, Momo. Okay?

1103
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:17,713
You're going to be doing me a favor.

1104
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:20,341
You a favor?

1105
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:21,300
Yeah.

1106
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:27,264
Consider it done.

1107
00:49:29,684 --> 00:49:30,809
I won't forget it.

1108
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,728
Oh, neither will I.

1109
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,458
<i>♫ Everyone is voting for Jack ♫</i>

1110
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,496
<i>♫ Cause he's got what all the rest lack. ♫</i>

1111
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,799

1112

1114

<i>♫ He's got high hopes. ♫</i>

1115
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:17,942
<i>♫ 1960 is the year for his high hopes ♫</i>

1116
00:50:20,735 --> 00:50:22,819
This date will go down in the history books

1117
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,748
of the Democratic Party: July 13, 1960.

1118
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:28,032
Senator John Kennedy has received the party's

1119
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:30,494
presidential nomination on the first ballot.

1120
00:50:30,745 --> 00:50:32,996
This makes Kennedy is only the second Catholic

1121
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:34,557
candidate in the history of the nation.

1122
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:37,125
Party solidarity is high, with the exception of

1123
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:39,711
the Mississippi delegation. Which booed Negro

1124
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:42,463
entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., as he led the

1125
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,425
convention in singing the national anthem.

1126
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:47,094
Although other voices drowned out the protest...

1127
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:49,471
Davis was noticeably shaken.

1128
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:10,434
Tony!

1129
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,535
Hey Frank, how are you?

1130
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,961
Hey. How you doing?

1131
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:14,371
How are you? Everything good?

1132
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,457
Everything good? Yeah, you too!

1133
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,383
Our first collaboration, boys.

1134
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,344
Courtesy of brother-in-Lawford.

1135
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,846
Ah! Congratulations. Finally
contribute something.

1136
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,005
Well, you old crumpety, you.

1137
00:51:34,075 --> 00:51:35,099
Listen.

1138
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,310
We're going to shoot the picture in Vegas by day

1139
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,004
and we're gonna play the Sands at night.

1140
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:39,979
We'll gonna tear up the town.

1141
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,866
In our spare time, we'll do our part for Jack.

1142
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,299
Spare time? What spare time?

1143
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,110
I don't sleep good standing up, Frank.

1144
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,528
Hey, uh...

1145
00:51:46,628 --> 00:51:49,105
Um Frank. Is there uh...

1146
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:49,890
You know something.

1147
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,932
Something in this for me?

1148
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:51,433
Yeah.

1149
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,155
You're going to play a singing garbageman Sam.

1150
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,353
Now, you're spoiling him.

1151
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,215
No, but seriously, Frank. Is there a part for me?

1152
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,501
Sam, it's a great part. Don't worry about it.

1153
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,085
Look at you worrying. You're getting wrinkles.

1154
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,753
There's a great part, Okay?

1155
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:04,337
Alright.

1156
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:04,938
Relax.

1157
00:52:04,939 --> 00:52:06,322
All right. Whatever you say.

1158
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,968
Sammy, you have got to play this part.

1159
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:12,805
There's singing, dancing, a wonderful title song.

1160
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:15,224
It's yours, baby. It's yours.

1161
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,141
Okay.

1162
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:18,393
I'm confused here, Frank.

1163
00:52:18,394 --> 00:52:21,117
You've got a story set in Vegas about oceans...

1164
00:52:21,188 --> 00:52:23,107
starring a schlemiel who sings about garbage.

1165
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:25,020
I'm Ocean, shmendrick.

1166
00:52:25,092 --> 00:52:26,902
I'm Danny Ocean. Shmendrick.

1167
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:29,087
You bums are part of my old commando unit.

1168
00:52:29,697 --> 00:52:30,405
We're ex-Gi's...

1169
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:31,966
Who reunite to knock over some casinos.

1170
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,126
The plot's a gasser. It's foolproof.

1171
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,453
I say. Screw the movie. Let's just pull the job.

1172
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:41,916
I figure if power doesn't mean that you have the

1173
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:44,420
opportunity to work with the people that you love

1174
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,881
Then you haven't really got any.

1175
00:52:48,149 --> 00:52:49,382
You're beautiful, Captain.

1176
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:50,342
Yeah.

1177
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,720
Okay Davis!

1178
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:53,553
I'll drink to that.

1179
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:54,430
All right.

1180
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:57,181
If Ike, Khrushchev and DeGaulle

1181
00:52:57,182 --> 00:52:58,892
can have their summit. Then why can't we?

1182
00:52:58,893 --> 00:53:00,269
Oh yeah! That's a good comparison.

1183
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,312
I'll be Khrushchev.

1184
00:53:02,363 --> 00:53:03,563
Somebody give me a ginger ale or something.

1185
00:53:03,564 --> 00:53:04,732
What am I, chopped liver?

1186
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:07,317
Here's to everybody. We all deserve it.

1187
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,293
Very good.

1188
00:53:09,236 --> 00:53:10,904
Time for less thinking and more drinking.

1189
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:11,880
Aye, aye.

1190
00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:13,699
Maybe I should just say "eye."

1191
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:14,616
Aye, aye.

1192
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,369
Here's two for the Jews.

1193
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,495
Who the fuck is that?

1194
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:21,021
Is that who I think it is?

1195
00:53:21,056 --> 00:53:21,999
The reporter.

1196
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,243
Yeah, that's the busboy.

1197
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:24,708
"Frank Sinatra, Wanna-Be Gangster."

1198
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:25,781
That's the guy who wrote it!

1199
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,546
He called me "Ava's Gardener."

1200
00:53:27,856 --> 00:53:29,681
No no! That guy's taller.

1201
00:53:29,682 --> 00:53:31,507
Sammy. I'm telling you, that's him!

1202
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:31,991
That's not him.

1203
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:33,552
He called me a sniveling mama's boy.

1204
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:35,036
That little fucking cocksucker!

1205
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:35,758
Wait a minute. Hold it!

1206
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:38,061
He meant it in the nicest way. Frank.

1207
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,476
Hey Bum!

1208
00:53:41,226 --> 00:53:42,598
What the fuck you doing in my restaurant?

1209
00:53:42,603 --> 00:53:44,062
It's still a free country. Isn't it Frank?

1210
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,981
No, it's not! It's a very expensive country.

1211
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:47,448
And you'll pay a serious price

1212
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:48,734
if you don't scram right now!

1213
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,027
I paid for my drink.

1214
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:51,820
Have him hold the appetizers.

1215
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:54,114
Here. Here. Here!

1216
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,158
Get the Hell away from me, you son of a bitch!

1217
00:53:58,619 --> 00:53:59,912
Hold it. Hold it! Frank!

1218
00:53:59,954 --> 00:54:00,813
Come on, Frank

1219
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:01,651
Get him out of here!

1220
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,290
You write that shit about me again.

1221
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,541
I'll fucking kill you!

1222
00:54:04,692 --> 00:54:06,459
Get out! Get out!

1223
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,902
I'm gonna fucking sue you!

1224
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:08,962
Get out!

1225
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:09,954
Son of a Bitch!

1226
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:11,406
You want to take a crack at me, pal?

1227
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:12,299
Shut up, Jimmy!

1228
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,843
Come on, let's go. It's okay. It's okay.

1229
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,693
I'm sorry, everybody.

1230
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:33,986
Tony. Tony.

1231
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:36,698
Everybody eats and drinks
on the house, all right?

1232
00:54:56,844 --> 00:54:57,977
Ladies and gentlemen.

1233
00:54:57,978 --> 00:54:59,822
Direct from the bar at the Sands Hotel...

1234
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:02,115
Mr. Dean Martin!

1235
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:17,460
How did all these people get in my room?

1236
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:35,645
Maestro, how long have I been on?

1237
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:44,758
<i>♫ Hey there ♫</i>

1238
00:55:44,826 --> 00:55:48,763
<i>♫ You with the stars in your eyes ♫</i>

1239
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:53,494
<i>♫ Love never made a fool of you ♫</i>

1240
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:55,036
<i>♫ You... ♫</i>

1241
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:04,711
There they are, folks:

1242
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:08,340
Tarzan, Jane and the African Queen.

1243
00:56:11,085 --> 00:56:13,679
I think I'll make myself a little salad.

1244
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,114
Let me help you out here a little.

1245
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,299
How about some lunch?

1246
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:26,291
Frank.

1247
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:28,698
Do you know how to make a fruit cordial?

1248
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:31,170
No, Dean. How do you make a fruit cordial?

1249
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:33,624
You be nice to him.

1250
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,417
Do you believe in fairy godmothers?

1251
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:38,670
No, but I have an uncle I'm keeping an eye on.

1252
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:41,681
Look at these two, ladies and gentlemen.

1253
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:42,774
The Italian bookends.

1254
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:45,509
Pretty soon they'll be telling you what

1255
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,033
wonderful work the Mafia has been doing.

1256
00:56:47,038 --> 00:56:48,055
Hey, hey hey!

1257
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:50,040
Have you ever seen a Jew-jitsu?

1258
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,557
Hey, hey! Now be fair. That's all I ask.

1259
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:54,477
How would you like it if I said

1260
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:55,758
"Have you ever seen a wop-sicle?"

1261
00:56:55,763 --> 00:56:57,198
Hey, hey. Hold it!

1262
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:59,058
Sorry. Frank is the boss.

1263
00:56:59,258 --> 00:57:00,441
I'm not really part of this show, folks.

1264
00:57:00,442 --> 00:57:01,802
I just couldn't get a reservation.

1265
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,786
Two Italians against one Jew.

1266
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,205
Sammy, come here. I need your help.

1267
00:57:05,306 --> 00:57:06,573
Get another Jew up here.

1268
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,168
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1269
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:12,162
My name is Sammy Davis, Jr.

1270
00:57:13,447 --> 00:57:16,041
Hurry up, Sam. Your watermelon's getting warm.

1271
00:57:21,322 --> 00:57:23,316
That's better than eating pizza every night.

1272
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:24,699
Yeah. At least we don't have to spit out

1273
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,261
spit out, spit out, spit out, spit out the crust.

1274
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,183
That's all, folks.

1275
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:34,760
Porky Sinatra.

1276
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,686
But seriously um, we'd like to start

1277
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:37,921
this entertainment off right.

1278
00:57:38,106 --> 00:57:40,066
I would like to begin by doing a few impressions.

1279
00:57:40,575 --> 00:57:43,151
And, the first one is of the kingfish.

1280
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,779
I was down at the Mystic Night Ski Lodge...

1281
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:50,242
[Dean Pretends to Speak Foreign Language]

1282
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:52,115
If all the women in Texas...

1283
00:57:52,186 --> 00:57:54,280
were as ugly as your mama...

1284
00:57:54,355 --> 00:57:58,875
the Lone Ranger gonna be alone for a long time.

1285
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:00,418
All right, you dirty rats

1286
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:02,254
who's been playing bocci with my sister?

1287
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,089
Someone's gotta entertain, Sam.

1288
00:58:05,533 --> 00:58:06,758
Here we go.

1289
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,515
Hey there...

1290
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,892
Yes?

1291
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:19,112
You want to laugh? Go sit out in the audience.

1292
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:20,448
We got a show to do.

1293
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:27,496
You used to be too wise.

1294
00:58:27,696 --> 00:58:29,214
Hey there.

1295
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:31,366
What the Hell is it, Sam?

1296
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:35,871
Sing us another tune, Sammy.

1297
00:58:37,565 --> 00:58:39,499
You think someday.

1298
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:42,161
She'll run to you.

1299
00:58:42,904 --> 00:58:46,548
Better forget her

1300
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,467
I can't work like this!

1301
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:53,013
She'll have you dancing on a string.

1302
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:59,011
Break it and she won't care.

1303
00:58:59,086 --> 00:59:01,521
Won't you take this advice

1304
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:05,025
I hand you like a brother.

1305
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:06,526
It's a mother, you mother.

1306
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:10,364
Jeez, ladies and gentlemen, he said half a word.

1307
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:12,151
After the show, you'll hear the other half.

1308
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,213
Bubee, please.

1309
00:59:19,214 --> 00:59:20,440
Whoa, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda.

1310
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,340
Whoa,Whoa,Whoa,Whoa!

1311
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:23,870
I'll sing with you, I'll dance with you...

1312
00:59:23,945 --> 00:59:25,379
I'll pick cotton with you...

1313
00:59:25,613 --> 00:59:27,422
I'll even go to a bar mitzvah with you...

1314
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,858
But don't touch me.

1315
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,597
What do you think, Jack? Should we grow up?

1316
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,049
Ladies and gentlemen...

1317
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,789
the next President of the United States...

1318
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:41,228
Senator John F. Kennedy.

1319
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,888
Take a bow.

1320
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:48,235
Jack Kennedy!

1321
00:59:48,769 --> 00:59:49,986
What was his name again?

1322
00:59:52,774 --> 00:59:54,532
Senator, we'd like you to accept this award

1323
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,535
on behalf of the NAACP.

1324
01:00:00,982 --> 01:00:02,958
Put me down, you nitwit.

1325
01:00:23,137 --> 01:00:24,129
Hey, boss.

1326
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:25,197
Where you been?

1327
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:27,399
Hey, I was in the casino
giving out your autograph.

1328
01:00:28,342 --> 01:00:29,609
Good night, Frank.

1329
01:00:31,012 --> 01:00:32,612
Hey! Did we kill tonight or what?

1330
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:34,948
We killed tonight.

1331
01:00:35,157 --> 01:00:36,512
I haven't heard laughs like that since...

1332
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:37,975
Since I played a little club in Poughkipsie.

1333
01:00:37,976 --> 01:00:39,202
In 1944

1334
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,620
Are you saying we weren't funny tonight?

1335
01:00:42,356 --> 01:00:44,624
What I'm saying is um...

1336
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,767
Watch this.

1337
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,294
Excuse me, ladies.

1338
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:50,164
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

1339
01:00:50,364 --> 01:00:52,264
Yeah, so?

1340
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:53,591
The whole world is drunk.

1341
01:00:53,592 --> 01:00:55,594
And we're just the cocktail of the moment, Pally.

1342
01:00:55,937 --> 01:00:57,344
One of these days, everybody's gonna

1343
01:00:57,345 --> 01:00:58,889
wake up with a heck of a hangover...

1344
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,183
down two aspirin with a glass of tomato juice...

1345
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:04,186
and wonder what the Hell all the fuss was about.

1346
01:01:04,812 --> 01:01:06,062
See you later, Joey.

1347
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,507
Time to try out some new jokes.

1348
01:01:08,883 --> 01:01:09,850
Good night, all.

1349
01:01:09,892 --> 01:01:10,841
Bluh, bluh! Bluh, bluh!

1350
01:01:10,842 --> 01:01:11,801
Good night, Dean.

1351
01:01:12,186 --> 01:01:14,279
That's a good idea. Let's get out of here.

1352
01:01:14,555 --> 01:01:15,547
It's getting late.

1353
01:01:16,157 --> 01:01:17,557
You can put your drinks over there.

1354
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:22,579
After you, Judy.

1355
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,587
You leaving, Babe?

1356
01:01:23,588 --> 01:01:25,015
Dreamland calls, Pally.

1357
01:01:26,067 --> 01:01:27,583
Thanks for a great evening, Sammy.

1358
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:28,585
Good night Smokie!

1359
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,120
You seen May?

1360
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,296
Yeah, she's up there.

1361
01:01:34,175 --> 01:01:35,317
Hey, sweetie, um.

1362
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:37,201
Frank and Dean and everybody took off.

1363
01:01:37,202 --> 01:01:38,374
So why don't we just go ahead and...

1364
01:01:38,379 --> 01:01:40,555
Why do you let them make fun of you?

1365
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:42,682
What? Who?

1366
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:45,644
They all make fun of you onstage.

1367

[SCOFFS]

1368
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:49,272
Come on, baby, that's just a gas.

1369
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:50,941
We rib each other. You know that.

1370
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:54,611
No, there is "of" and there is "with."

1371
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,093
Night after night, I study the difference.

1372
01:01:57,164 --> 01:01:58,931
They make fun "of" you, not "with" you.

1373
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:01,418
May you're acting like Charlie-Party-Pooper here.

1374
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,285
Okay?

1375
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:04,955
I'm acting like I love you.

1376
01:02:07,241 --> 01:02:08,959
I don't know why sometime.

1377
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,878
All your gold and your flash

1378
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,089
and your "babies" all the time.

1379
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:15,549
I hate it!

1380
01:02:15,783 --> 01:02:18,409
You're short. You're not good looking.

1381
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,469
Oh, Gee thanks.

1382
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,804
But I think you left something out.

1383
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,239
Right Babe? Like skin color.

1384
01:02:26,435 --> 01:02:27,169
May!

1385
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:30,814
I never even saw your skin color, you idiot!

1386
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:33,775
I'm not your friends.

1387
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:42,434
Listen...

1388
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:46,371
Sometimes Frank and the guys they,

1389
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,847
They cross the line.

1390
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:50,834
Okay, and yes, sometimes it hurts.

1391
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:55,546
So I get a little dirt on my uniform. So what!

1392
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:57,552
The point is, I'm circling the bases...

1393
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:59,821
and the fellas that come up behind me...

1394
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:01,428
they are gonna have it easier.

1395

Can't you see that?

1396
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,102
All I see is your heart...

1397
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:11,605
and your talent...

1398
01:03:12,406 --> 01:03:13,690
and your courage.

I don't care what our children look like.

01:03:17,745 --> 01:03:20,472
Brown, white, polka dot.

1401
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:23,658
I just want them to have your courage.

1402
01:03:25,486 --> 01:03:27,746
May, will you,

1403
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:28,872
Yes.

1404
01:03:29,423 --> 01:03:30,165
People will,

1405
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:32,207
I don't care a damn. I never have.

1406
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,400
You don't give a damn.

01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:18,106
<i>♫ Like the fella once said ♫</i>

1433
01:05:18,356 --> 01:05:20,289
<i>♫ Ain't that a kick in the head ♫</i>

1434
01:05:30,118 --> 01:05:32,203
<i>♫ Like the sailor once said quote ♫</i>

1435
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,998
<i>♫ Ain't that a hole in the boat ♫</i>

1436
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:39,043
<i>♫ My head keeps spinning ♫</i>

1437
01:05:39,377 --> 01:05:42,839
<i>♫ I go to sleep and be grinning ♫</i>

1438
01:05:43,056 --> 01:05:46,259

1442

1443
01:06:01,775 --> 01:06:03,818

1444
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:07,822
<i>♫ Tell me quick ♫</i>

1445
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:10,241
<i>♫ Oh ain't love a kick ♫</i>

1446
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:13,787
<i>♫ Tell me quick ♫</i>

1447
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:20,078
<i>♫ Ain't love a kick in the head. ♫</i>

1448
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:25,280
Okay, let me have it.

1449
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,674
When do we blow this mausoleum?

1450
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:32,968
Day after tomorrow, gentlemen.

1451
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,134
We'll be in Las Vegas.

1452
01:06:47,989 --> 01:06:49,957
Happy New Year.

1453
01:06:50,024 --> 01:06:52,288
- Mark it.
- Slate 42, take one.

1454
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,351
And cut. One more right away.

1455
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:56,419
What was wrong with that?

1456
01:06:57,899 --> 01:07:00,834
Nothing, Frank. I just want another for safety.

1457
01:07:00,902 --> 01:07:02,765
Safety? What, are we jumping out of an airplane?

1458
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,963
You said action, we did the scene, you said cut.

1459
01:07:05,006 --> 01:07:06,880
That's it. It's over, finite.

1460
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:08,070
Come on, boys, let's take a steam.

1461
01:07:08,075 --> 01:07:09,049
Oh, we're spritzing.

1462
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,535
Take us down, Riley

1463
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:11,353
Coming down.

1464
01:07:14,515 --> 01:07:16,307
Relax, Miley, it's only a movie.

1465
01:07:16,675 --> 01:07:18,184
Well, I guess that was a print.

1466
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:40,373
That's it. That's the ticket.

1467
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:43,138
Those last four bars... That's how I want it.

1468
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:46,545
Yeah, right. Alright, I'll talk to you in a week.

1469
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:50,540
- How you doing, Sam?
- Pretty good, Skipper.

1470
01:07:50,618 --> 01:07:53,383
Where's May? She sticking around?

1471
01:07:53,454 --> 01:07:55,013
- Like glue, daddy.
- That a boy.

1472
01:07:55,056 --> 01:07:56,888
We're getting married, Frank.

1473
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:09,986
Sam, they're gonna crucify you.

1474
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:13,197
Yeah, I know.

1475
01:08:14,308 --> 01:08:15,241
Is she up for it?

1476
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:16,743
Oh, she says she is.

1477
01:08:16,944 --> 01:08:18,635
She uh, just wanted to know why I haven't asked

1478
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,289
her to convert. You know, To become "Yewish."

1479
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,332
I told her we'd see about that when she

1480
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,733
learns how to say the "J" sound, Baby.

1481
01:08:27,288 --> 01:08:28,755
She's a somebody, Sammy.

1482
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:29,956
Yes.

1483
01:08:34,829 --> 01:08:36,490
You're getting married.

1484
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:37,847
You're a lucky man.

1485
01:08:39,432 --> 01:08:40,526
All right.

1486
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,435
Frank, I don't want to put you on the spot or

1487
01:08:43,436 --> 01:08:48,149
anything but I was hoping you'd stand up with me.

1488
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,117
I'd be honored to stand up with you.

1489
01:08:59,687 --> 01:09:01,287
It would be an honor.

1490
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,624
Thanks.

1491
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:12,490
I just ran into a French reporter.

1492
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,925
Quite sexy, actually.

1493
01:09:14,035 --> 01:09:16,761
She asked me, who's in Rat?

1494
01:09:17,038 --> 01:09:18,346
What did you say?

1495
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:19,681
For some pussy?

1496
01:09:22,376 --> 01:09:25,056
Hey, listen to this, we're getting
more press than Elvis these days.

1497
01:09:25,146 --> 01:09:29,357
And a good thing too, 'cause that
Elvis fella sets such a bad example.

1498
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:31,484
For the nation's youth.

1499
01:09:31,552 --> 01:09:33,527
"People in Hollywood refer to Sinatra's gang

1500
01:09:33,528 --> 01:09:35,237
as the Rat Pack" an offspring of the late

1501
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:38,156
Humphrey Bogart's Holmby Hill's Rat Pack whose

1502
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:40,784
exclusive ranks, including Mr. Sinatra, of course

1503
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:42,904
were dedicated to drinking, carousing, and

1504
01:09:43,004 --> 01:09:46,132
generally thumbing their noses
at conventional morality.”

1505
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,126
Oh, my. Well, thumb, thumb, thumb.

1506
01:09:49,403 --> 01:09:51,879
"Some people also refer to
Sinatra's pack as the Clan."

1507
01:09:52,073 --> 01:09:53,196
With Sammy as a member?

1508
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:55,173
To be part of the Clan, "You have to be cuckoo."

1509
01:09:55,174 --> 01:09:56,049
That leaves me out.

1510
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:57,574
“You have to be hip in their way of hip.“

1511
01:09:57,579 --> 01:09:58,677
Oh, That leaves you out.

1512
01:09:58,678 --> 01:10:00,158
That definitely leaves you out, Ciro.

1513
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:01,848
Yeah, you also have to have talent.

1514
01:10:02,183 --> 01:10:04,267
And that leaves us all out!

1515
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:09,187
"Nonconformity is now the key
to social importance in Hollywood."

1516
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:12,192
Then it just sort of goes on here.

1517
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:16,153
- What?
- Nothing. It's just crap, okay Frank.

1518
01:10:16,154 --> 01:10:17,087
- Read it.
- I'm not...

1519
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:17,914
Read it!

1520
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:20,007
"And that angry middle-aged man, Frank Sinatra,"

1521
01:10:23,202 --> 01:10:24,500
"is its prophet and reigning monarch."

1522
01:10:24,505 --> 01:10:27,915
"That Senator John Kennedy has associated
himself with such childishness..."

1523
01:10:28,242 --> 01:10:33,046
"perhaps explains why he trails the
less hip Richard Nixon in the polls.”

1524
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:36,107
- Crap!
- Goddamn, give me this thing.

1525
01:10:36,584 --> 01:10:39,469
What do I have to accomplish for these
people to give me some respect?

1526
01:10:39,677 --> 01:10:40,595
Huh?

1527
01:10:43,524 --> 01:10:45,016
Greetings, fellow clansmen.

1528
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:46,496
You know, looking at you guys naked,

1529
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:48,227
I see why God created clothing.

1530
01:10:50,431 --> 01:10:51,522
Hah, what did I say?

1531
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:52,665
Nothing.

1532
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,820
Sammy

1533
01:10:57,838 --> 01:11:00,423
Everybody, Sammy's got an announcement to make.

1534
01:11:01,107 --> 01:11:05,244
Oh, uh. Actually, uh

1535
01:11:06,781 --> 01:11:08,831
May and I have decided to get married.

1536
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:12,043
Goddamn it!

1537
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:15,486
A month of this horrendous publicity...

1538
01:11:15,556 --> 01:11:17,256
and he still doesn't get it.

1539
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:19,759
Dad, you'll have a stroke. Calm down.

1540
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:23,957
Bad enough we had that Albert Maltz fiasco.

1541
01:11:24,032 --> 01:11:26,626
Bad enough we have to drag the
Pope and all his baggage...

1542
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:28,191
down to Dixie with us.

1543
01:11:28,269 --> 01:11:32,706
Now we have the most prominent,
visible members of this campaign...

1544
01:11:32,774 --> 01:11:36,602
as groom and best man at an interracial marriage!

1545
01:11:36,678 --> 01:11:37,818
It's not all bad, you know.

1546
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:38,902
I mean, The New York, Times

1547
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:41,805
"The New York Times" just this morning
was saying some very nice things...

1548
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:45,785
about Jack not backing away from Frank and...

1549
01:11:46,087 --> 01:11:49,329
The people in Alabama don't read
"The New York Times" Peter.

1550
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:51,873
You just grab the first flight to the Springs and

1551
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,417
you tell Frank, He goes to that wedding, he'll

1552
01:11:54,418 --> 01:11:57,112
feel like he's standing at the North Pole in his

1553
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,441
bare feet so far as this family is concerned.

1554
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:02,394
Believe me, Dad, I've tried.

1555
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:05,629
Oh, Sinatra scares the piss out of you!

1556
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:10,810
You know what? Bobby, you call him.

1557
01:12:11,813 --> 01:12:17,400
My son-in-law is too weak-kneed
to stand up to big, bad Frank.

1558
01:12:25,693 --> 01:12:27,743
Save the white race!

1559
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:29,704
Save the white race!

1560
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:31,372
Save the white race!

1561
01:12:31,956 --> 01:12:33,040
Save the white race!

1562
01:12:44,912 --> 01:12:46,721
"Dear nigger bastard."

1563
01:12:47,382 --> 01:12:50,266
I see Sinatra is going to be best man at your

1564
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:52,518
"abortion.”

1565
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:03,320
“It's good to know the kind of people

1566
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:05,990
supporting Kennedy before it's too late.”

1567
01:13:08,102 --> 01:13:10,036
And the idiot misspelled "too" twice.

1568
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:15,624
Nazis and death threats right
here in Washington, D.C.

1569
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,126
It's cuckoo, huh Big John.

1570
01:13:30,225 --> 01:13:31,873
Ah, no no, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

1571
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:32,874
What are you doing, boss?

1572
01:13:32,894 --> 01:13:34,684
Look, I don't want to act like Charley John Wayne

1573
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:36,519
but I'm not going to let some crazed idiot

1574
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,280
jump on that stage without defending myself.

1575
01:13:38,466 --> 01:13:39,214
You can't go out there

1576
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:40,232
I can't go on with these first

1577
01:13:40,233 --> 01:13:42,151
but have them ready, Big John.

1578
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,869
Cause I'm gonna move the gun tricks up early in

1579
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:45,947
the act and I just won't bother to take them off.

1580
01:13:58,686 --> 01:14:02,486
Hello. Yeah. All right, hold on.

1581
01:14:02,557 --> 01:14:04,423
It's Mr. Sinatra for you, boss.

1582
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:09,262
Hey Frank!

1583
01:14:09,497 --> 01:14:10,805
How you holding up, Smokey?

1584
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:13,099
Oh, I'm fine Dad. How are you?

1585
01:14:13,134 --> 01:14:14,057
How about May?

1586
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,310
I hope she's wrapping up fish in those headlines.

1587
01:14:16,771 --> 01:14:19,647
Frank, she told me that you called and...

1588
01:14:20,608 --> 01:14:21,940
You're wonderful, you know that?

1589
01:14:21,941 --> 01:14:24,009
I mean that. You're very, very special, Frank.

1590
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:24,926
It's okay.

1591
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,861
It's okay. You just hang in there, buster.

1592
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,281
I'll see you at the wedding.

1593
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:29,873
Yeah, about that, I...

1594
01:14:29,874 --> 01:14:32,827
Smokey, can it. I'll see you soon.

1595
01:14:35,723 --> 01:14:36,830
Peter's here, Frank.

1596
01:14:36,831 --> 01:14:37,832
Hey, Cyril.

1597
01:14:46,034 --> 01:14:47,816
"You will end up in the middle of,"

1598
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,636
"the North Pole without shoes on your feet.”

1599
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:52,221
Because of what?

1600
01:14:53,341 --> 01:14:55,490
Interracial marriage. None of it, whatsoever.

1601
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,374
He doesn't want any,

1602
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:58,351
Peter, just save it, all right?

1603
01:14:58,352 --> 01:14:59,060
Just save it

1604
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:00,855
It's 1960, for Chrissake.

1605
01:15:01,249 --> 01:15:03,083
Jack has the guts to face the music.

1606
01:15:03,151 --> 01:15:04,734
I mean, goddamn it!

1607
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:07,278
America has to grow up. This is ridiculous!

1608
01:15:07,422 --> 01:15:09,947
Jack can't face the music from Palm Springs.

1609
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:13,116
George!

1610
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:14,075
He's the power of the White House.

1611
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,410
George, where are my cigarettes?

1612
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:16,263
Here.

1613
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:17,204
George!

1614
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:22,833
- What?
- Frank, it's Sammy.

1615
01:15:22,904 --> 01:15:25,087
Well wouldn't you know? My rabbi just called.

1616
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,840
And uh, he has a bar mitzvah booked that day.

1617
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:33,095
And uh, there seems to be a slight hitch in
getting The Escoffier Room for the reception.

1618
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:38,750
So, May and I have decided, that, you know we're

1619
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:42,521
going to postpone the wedding for a few weeks.

1620
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:48,234
We don't know exactly when it will be but, you

1621
01:15:48,235 --> 01:15:50,946
know, we'll be sure to give you plenty of notice.

1622
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:52,782
You're lying, Charlie.

1623
01:15:54,168 --> 01:15:56,702
I'm just telling a different
kind of truth, that's all.

1624
01:16:06,121 --> 01:16:07,421
Sam,

1625
01:16:16,222 --> 01:16:17,681
You don't have to do this.

1626
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:21,310
You hear me?

1627
01:16:22,553 --> 01:16:23,753
You don't have to do this Sam.

1628
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:26,732
Not your wedding.

1629
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,403
I'd never ask that.

1630
01:16:30,872 --> 01:16:32,738
I'd never ask this, Sammy.

1631
01:16:35,143 --> 01:16:36,617
I know.

1632
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:08,441
You happy?

1633
01:17:14,549 --> 01:17:16,157
Save the white race!

1634
01:17:16,574 --> 01:17:17,992
Save the white race!

1635
01:17:18,576 --> 01:17:20,035
Save the white race!

1636
01:17:22,146 --> 01:17:23,372
Save the white race!

1637
01:17:26,794 --> 01:17:28,678
Hey, Charlie-Nazis!

1638
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,588
There's that nigger Jew boy!

1639
01:17:30,638 --> 01:17:32,590
I figured you crackers couldn't afford a ticket.

1640
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,633
I Thought I'd bring the show to you.

1641
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:57,148
<i>♫ I've got you. ♫</i>

1642
01:17:57,248 --> 01:18:00,060
<i>♫ Under my skin. ♫</i>

1643
01:18:00,962 --> 01:18:02,862
<i>♫ Got you. ♫</i>

1644
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,262
<i>♫ Deep in the heart of me. ♫</i>

1645
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,168
<i>♫ So deep in my heart. ♫</i>

1646
01:18:08,236 --> 01:18:11,629
<i>♫ That you're really a part of me ♫</i>

1647
01:18:12,305 --> 01:18:16,884
<i>♫ I got you, ooh under my skin ♫</i>

1648
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,515
<i>♫ I'd sacrifice anything come what might. ♫</i>

1649
01:18:25,587 --> 01:18:27,820
<i>♫ For the sake of having you near. ♫</i>

1650
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,855
<i>♫ In spite of that crazy voice
that comes in the night ♫</i>

1651
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:32,689
<i>♫ And repeats and repeats in my ear. ♫</i>

1652
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:35,658
<i>♫ Don't you know. ♫</i>

1653
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:38,324
<i>♫ You never can win. ♫</i>

1654
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:39,740
<i>♫ Use your mentality. ♫</i>

1655
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,035
<i>♫ Wake up to reality. ♫</i>

1656
01:18:43,604 --> 01:18:46,232
<i>♫ But each time I do, just the thought of you. ♫</i>

1657
01:18:46,307 --> 01:18:48,207
<i>♫ Makes me stop before I begin. ♫</i>

1658
01:18:48,276 --> 01:18:50,251
<i>♫ 'Cause I got you. Got cha. Got cha. ♫</i>

1659
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,462
<i>♫ Got cha, Got cha, Got cha, Got cha ♫</i>

1660
01:18:53,571 --> 01:18:54,517
<i>♫ Got cha. Got cha. ♫</i>

1661
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:56,557
<i>♫ Got cha, Got cha, Got you! ♫</i>

1662
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:58,133
<i>♫ I got you under my skin! ♫</i>

1663
01:19:10,432 --> 01:19:12,314
<i>We love you Sammy!</i>

1664
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:13,808
<i>We love Sammy!</i>

1665
01:19:14,108 --> 01:19:15,434
Save the white race!

1666
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:17,002
Save the white race!

1667
01:19:17,302 --> 01:19:18,621
Save the white race!

1668
01:19:18,904 --> 01:19:20,406
Save the white race!

1669
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,283
Save the white race!

1670
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:24,034
Save the white race!

1671
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,995
Save the white race!

1672
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,663
Save the white race!

1673
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,415
Save the white race!

1674
01:19:30,118 --> 01:19:32,276
Three minutes till show time, Mr. Davis.

1675
01:19:34,489 --> 01:19:36,046
No, I want to...

1676
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,173
Do you know who this is?

1677
01:19:38,593 --> 01:19:40,134
This is Frank Sinatra

1678
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,720
and I want you to put me through to Nixon now!

1679
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:45,763
Listen, I know he's staying at the Ambassador,

1680
01:19:45,764 --> 01:19:47,096
and I want the crumb to concede...

1681
01:19:47,101 --> 01:19:48,726
so put him through now!

1682
01:19:50,404 --> 01:19:52,372
Son of a bitch!

1683
01:19:53,841 --> 01:19:55,357
We did it, Dino. We did it!

1684
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,650
We're going to the White House.

1685
01:19:56,717 --> 01:19:57,838
We're going to the White House.

1686
01:19:57,843 --> 01:19:58,836
Hey Frankie!

1687
01:19:59,912 --> 01:20:00,863
Jack!

1688
01:20:01,015 --> 01:20:02,740
Congratulations, Honey.

1689
01:20:03,451 --> 01:20:06,614
Ava? How are you?

1690
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:08,037
Well, I'm sure proud of you.

1691
01:20:08,354 --> 01:20:10,034
There's too much static. Can you hear me'?

1692
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:12,388
It's the most beautiful static I ever heard!

1693
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,875
Frank, you're breaking up,

1694
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:16,295
But I'm coming to L.A. soon, and I'll call you.

1695
01:20:16,531 --> 01:20:19,006
- You hear me'?
- Yeah, I hear you. Call me!

1696
01:20:19,857 --> 01:20:20,841
But...

1697
01:20:25,306 --> 01:20:26,722
What do you know?

1698
01:20:27,175 --> 01:20:28,515
What a night, Dino!

1699
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:30,267
What a night, Dean!

1700
01:20:30,678 --> 01:20:33,020
Here we go. Here we go. Won.

1701
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:34,255
Frank!

1702
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:35,539
Jack!

1703
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:38,985
- Hey, canary.
- Hey, Charlie-Tommy-Gun!

1704
01:20:39,053 --> 01:20:40,778
- It's Momo.
- Congratulations.

1705
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:42,470
Just tell your pal we turned out the living

1706
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:43,655
and raised the dead in Chicago...

1707
01:20:43,656 --> 01:20:45,491
like it was a Catholic resurrection.

1708
01:20:45,526 --> 01:20:47,326
Great job! Thank you!

1709
01:20:47,362 --> 01:20:48,952
Be good, Frank.

1710
01:20:51,232 --> 01:20:52,998
I love that guy. What a character.

1711
01:20:53,134 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah, he's a real teddy bear.

1712
01:20:56,471 --> 01:20:58,253
So long, Nixon.

1713
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,321
Frank Sinatra flew into Washington from his

1714
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,490
brand-new Cal-Neva Casino on the shores of Lake

1715
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:04,425
Tahoe to stage the most star studded inaugural

1716
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:06,244
gala in the history of the Republic with the

1717
01:21:06,245 --> 01:21:07,979
conspicuous absence of fellow "Rats" Dean Martin

1718
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:08,989
and Sammy Davis.

1719
01:21:09,089 --> 01:21:10,390
Martin claimed to have a movie commitment

1720
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:12,141
even though Lawrence Oliver shut down

1721
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:13,644
his Broadway show to attend.

1722
01:21:13,811 --> 01:21:15,812
Davis, who postponed his marriage to May Britt

1723
01:21:15,813 --> 01:21:17,021
until after the inaugural,

1724
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:18,816
also claimed to have other commitments.

1725
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:58,105
Ten days at the Fountain Blue Dino. That's it.

1726
01:21:58,299 --> 01:21:59,647
Johnny, I wish I could help you.

1727
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,889
But I'm booked solid for more
than a year in advance now.

1728
01:22:01,936 --> 01:22:03,526
Between the movies and Vegas,

1729
01:22:03,527 --> 01:22:05,848
shoot my youngest don't even
know what I look like no more.

1730
01:22:06,007 --> 01:22:08,282
You realize that this request
comes from Momo, himself?

1731
01:22:08,643 --> 01:22:10,409
What, I got stupid all of the sudden?

1732
01:22:11,012 --> 01:22:12,852
Besides, I'm booked in Cal-Neva in October.

1733
01:22:12,853 --> 01:22:13,578
Ain't that enough?

1734
01:22:13,579 --> 01:22:15,372
Cal-Neva has nothing to do with Sam.

1735
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:17,666
Oh yeah, and Jerry and I are still an act.

1736
01:22:18,786 --> 01:22:20,418
Frank's always available to Sam.

1737
01:22:20,419 --> 01:22:22,756
See now, Frank keeps a looser schedule than me.

1738
01:22:22,824 --> 01:22:25,257
Cause I got to work more since I got seven kids.

1739
01:22:25,994 --> 01:22:27,962
You got big balls Paison, that's what you got.

1740
01:22:28,029 --> 01:22:30,179
I'm just a hardworking guy, John.

1741
01:22:31,263 --> 01:22:33,057
So, what are you two A-holes up to?

1742
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:35,267
He's a real (Italian Insult), this one.

1743
01:22:35,336 --> 01:22:36,935
Yeah, that's why we love him.

1744
01:22:37,238 --> 01:22:39,145
Oh Shrimp. They look good. Hey!

1745
01:22:39,146 --> 01:22:40,272
Unh, uh, uh.

1746
01:22:40,341 --> 01:22:41,648
Those are spoken for.

1747
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,322
Salut!

1748
01:22:48,682 --> 01:22:50,215
Salut!

1749
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:52,909
The happy relationship

1750
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:55,078
between arts and politics

1751
01:22:55,079 --> 01:22:58,165
which has characterized our long history.

1752
01:22:58,726 --> 01:23:00,317
I think reached culmination tonight.

1753
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:01,417
Here it comes.

1754
01:23:01,418 --> 01:23:03,295
I know we're all indebted to a great friend...

1755
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:05,547
Frank Sinatra.

1756
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:08,241
Oh no!

1757
01:23:08,242 --> 01:23:09,802
You're not playing this again. are you?

1758
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:12,346
Hey, Dino! What are you doing?

1759
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:14,515
People say bad things about me now...

1760
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:17,183
they're gonna be calling the President
of the United States a liar.

1761
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:18,935
Did you read the script?

1762
01:23:18,936 --> 01:23:21,295
Oh yeah. "Gunga Din" all over again. Pally.

1763
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,105
Where do you get that?

1764
01:23:22,106 --> 01:23:23,512
- Uh hmm.
- "Gunga Din"?

1765
01:23:23,517 --> 01:23:25,525
Oh, by the way, have you heard the news, boys?

1766
01:23:25,526 --> 01:23:26,235
What's that?

1767
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,237
Brother Bobby made Attorney General.

1768
01:23:28,362 --> 01:23:29,821
Hey. Whoo! That's something.

1769
01:23:29,822 --> 01:23:31,156
I wish I was a Kennedy.

1770
01:23:33,728 --> 01:23:34,727
When did you hear that?

1771
01:23:34,827 --> 01:23:37,329
Oh, my dial is tuned, Frank.

1772
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:40,081
Nice to hear that a choirboy with a passion

1773
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:42,042
for sin will be watching out for us, huh?

1774
01:23:43,137 --> 01:23:44,837
Fellas, excuse us for a minute, please.

1775
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,131
Yeah, sure. No problem, Dino.

1776
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:48,924
You okay, Frank?

1777
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:49,967
Yeah.

1778
01:23:56,584 --> 01:23:58,533
So Bobby made top cop.

1779
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:08,819
It's a surprise...

1780
01:24:10,496 --> 01:24:11,655
I guess.

1781
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,533
Hey, we're singers, not soothsayers, huh?

1782
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:17,494
Listen,

1783
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:20,998
I want to sell you my interest
in the Cal-Neva, Frank..

1784
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,541
What?

1785
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24,710
What are you talking about?

1786
01:24:24,879 --> 01:24:26,061
Hidden ownership, Charlie.

1787
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:27,612
Plucked a grape from the vine,

1788
01:24:27,613 --> 01:24:29,756
got a sour taste from a bad seed named Momo.

1789
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:30,711
Want to spit it out.

1790
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,067
Dean, come on.

1791
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,260
I love you, dago.

1792
01:24:34,288 --> 01:24:36,054
You can pay me to play there anytime.

1793
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,264
Bobby's gonna have Momo's
Guinea ass in a frying pan.

1794
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:40,359
I don't want him to use me for the seasoning.

1795
01:24:40,461 --> 01:24:42,019
That's never gonna happen.

1796
01:24:42,497 --> 01:24:44,270
I've got some friends in very high places,

1797
01:24:44,271 --> 01:24:45,495
or haven't you heard Dino?

1798
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,691
Dago, you'll excuse me, but you may be

1799
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:50,776
il capo de tuti capi in Tinsel Town,

1800
01:24:50,777 --> 01:24:51,861
but in Washington,

1801
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:53,864
you're just a skinny wop from Hoboken.

1802
01:24:56,283 --> 01:24:58,385
Do you have any idea what they did for Jack?

1803
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,495
Oh, I have an idea.

1804
01:25:00,579 --> 01:25:02,106
Everybody has ideas.

1805
01:25:02,206 --> 01:25:02,998
Well...

1806
01:25:03,017 --> 01:25:04,458
What's an idea, Frank?

1807
01:25:04,986 --> 01:25:06,668
It's a weightless electrical charge.

1808
01:25:07,288 --> 01:25:09,463
It don't stand up in the court of reality...

1809
01:25:09,524 --> 01:25:11,673
which is where we'll all be tried.

1810
01:25:14,529 --> 01:25:16,003
President Kennedy's on line two.

1811
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:16,737
What?

1812
01:25:16,931 --> 01:25:17,921
President Kennedy is calling.

1813
01:25:17,922 --> 01:25:18,805
The President?

1814
01:25:19,534 --> 01:25:21,141
The President's on line two for me.

1815
01:25:21,269 --> 01:25:22,558
You see? The the president of what?

1816
01:25:22,559 --> 01:25:23,684
What's he the president of?

1817
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:24,770
The United States.

1818
01:25:24,839 --> 01:25:26,239
The President of the United States?

1819
01:25:26,474 --> 01:25:28,856
The President on line two for me.

1820
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:30,400
I heard you the first 15 times.

1821
01:25:30,712 --> 01:25:32,653
You're such a pessimist.

1822
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:34,780
Give my love to Jacqueline.

1823
01:25:37,552 --> 01:25:40,077
Jack, how are you?

1824
01:25:40,822 --> 01:25:43,079
Mr. Kennedy will you address rumors of widespread

1825
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,607
voter fraud in Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois?

1826
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:46,540
There are those...

1827
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,918
Frankly, I uh. I believe it's irresponsible

1828
01:25:48,919 --> 01:25:50,378
for press to be uh...

1829
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:53,215
printing baseless rumors and, and uh, innuendo.

1830
01:25:53,601 --> 01:25:55,398
My brother's President of the United States...

1831
01:25:55,403 --> 01:25:57,552
because he and others fought hard and, and won.

1832
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,170
Next.

1833
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,347
Mr. Kennedy, do you expect to

1834
01:26:01,348 --> 01:26:02,932
delve into any particular fields

1835
01:26:02,933 --> 01:26:04,493
when you take over as Attorney General?

1836
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:06,227
Uh, yes, there are a number of areas

1837
01:26:06,228 --> 01:26:08,647
um, where I think action is needed...

1838
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,450
Such as in the field of organized crime.

1839
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:13,734
I think that's a very serious situation that

1840
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,837
faces this country at the present time.

1841
01:26:16,224 --> 01:26:17,754
There are a number of steps that can be taken.

1842
01:26:17,759 --> 01:26:20,600
I can say here today that I will make every

1843
01:26:20,601 --> 01:26:23,311
effort to apply the full weight of this great

1844
01:26:23,312 --> 01:26:25,788
office to put in jail hoodlums like

1845
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:26,872
Carlos Marcello, Trafficante.

1846
01:26:26,873 --> 01:26:29,843
Momo Giancana and Santo

1847
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,502
You dirty bastard!

1848
01:26:31,503 --> 01:26:33,964
Crime bosses deported from this country.

1849
01:26:45,486 --> 01:26:46,601
Hug me, hug me.

1850
01:27:06,274 --> 01:27:07,414
Come here.

1851
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:12,544
Uhhhh!

1852
01:27:14,615 --> 01:27:16,797
You answer that, and I'll leave.

1853
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,257
I gotta get it. It's line number five.

1854
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:19,508
It could be an emergency,

1855
01:27:19,509 --> 01:27:22,304
Nobody calls on that unless it's important, Ava.

1856
01:27:22,396 --> 01:27:24,181
Come on. I gotta get this.

1857
01:27:24,959 --> 01:27:25,848
Hello.

1858
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:26,933
It's Roselli.

1859
01:27:28,096 --> 01:27:29,603
Hey, Johnny, how you doing?

1860
01:27:29,797 --> 01:27:31,588
I hear Ava's blowing on your dice again.

1861
01:27:31,688 --> 01:27:33,857
Maybe she likes your new Irish friends.

1862
01:27:34,302 --> 01:27:36,276
Or maybe she's bored with bullfighters.

1863
01:27:36,304 --> 01:27:37,277
How'd you hear that?

1864
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:38,301
J. Edgar Hoover told me.

1865
01:27:38,306 --> 01:27:39,904
We're on a first name basis these days.

1866
01:27:39,905 --> 01:27:41,825
So what are ya gonna have a fuckin conversation?

1867
01:27:41,876 --> 01:27:43,100
Just wait a minute.

1868
01:27:43,478 --> 01:27:45,399
Giancana, oh he would have called you himself...

1869
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,241
but he's having a little trouble swallowing.

1870
01:27:47,382 --> 01:27:49,506
Because while you're fucking we're gettin fucked!

1871
01:27:49,684 --> 01:27:51,645
You can fry an egg in the heat we're gettin here.

1872
01:27:52,487 --> 01:27:53,794
You know how he gets, Frankie.

1873
01:27:54,489 --> 01:27:56,546
This kind of thing make a lot of people upset.

1874
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:57,756
Okay, yeah.

1875
01:27:57,992 --> 01:27:59,256
There's so many bugs in the walls,

1876
01:27:59,257 --> 01:28:00,509
we need an exterminator.

1877
01:28:02,664 --> 01:28:03,678
Wait a minute.

1878
01:28:03,687 --> 01:28:05,305
Hey Frankie, are you listening to me'?

1879
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,849
I'm calling on behalf of Momo himself!

1880
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:08,934
I'm listening.

1881
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,476
Sam wanted me to remind you

1882
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:12,287
that it was you who came to us.

1883
01:28:13,675 --> 01:28:15,755
We went out on a line for
these fucking Kennedy guys.

1884
01:28:16,325 --> 01:28:17,234
We did our part.

1885
01:28:17,259 --> 01:28:18,092
(Whispers) I'm leaving.

1886
01:28:18,093 --> 01:28:20,921
Otherwise, we'd be seeing Nixon
on the front page every day.

1887
01:28:22,517 --> 01:28:23,698
I'm leaving Frank.

1888
01:28:23,782 --> 01:28:24,475
Wait.

1889
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,699
How they got where they are...

1890
01:28:25,709 --> 01:28:27,744
None of us expected any thanks, Frank.

1891
01:28:28,256 --> 01:28:30,122
We didn't expect a pinky up our ass either.

1892
01:28:30,231 --> 01:28:31,831
Now, you tell your new friend, Joe Kennedy,

1893
01:28:31,832 --> 01:28:33,291
to call off that mongrel son.

1894
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:36,002
Put a choke chain on Bobby. You got it?

1895
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,295
All right, I will.

1896
01:28:37,332 --> 01:28:39,339
You want me to tell Sam the load is too heavy?

1897
01:28:39,756 --> 01:28:41,107
- Is that what you want me to tell him? 
- Go fuck yourself, Frank.

1898
01:28:41,869 --> 01:28:43,134
Cause, that's what I will.

1899
01:28:43,135 --> 01:28:44,935
But I don't think it's the right thing to do.

1900
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:46,996
Now, you gotta deliver us a little favor Frank.

1901
01:28:46,997 --> 01:28:47,940
Fuck you, Frank!

1902
01:28:47,975 --> 01:28:50,275
You gotta tell old man Kennedy
to call off the dogs.

1903
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,593
I will. Okay.

1904
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:52,669
All right. Good.

1905
01:28:53,214 --> 01:28:55,021
Now give Ava a spanking from me.

1906
01:28:56,606 --> 01:28:58,150
(Scoffs)

1907
01:29:01,322 --> 01:29:03,697
Ava. Ava, what's your problem?

1908
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:04,906
Ava.

1909
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,576
I don't want to hear it.

1910
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:08,869
What?

1911
01:29:08,896 --> 01:29:10,745
I thought maybe you'd grown up.

1912
01:29:13,234 --> 01:29:15,208
I thought you were travelin in different circles.

1913
01:29:15,269 --> 01:29:17,203
You obviously don't know how things work Ava.

1914
01:29:17,271 --> 01:29:19,629
Because the circles, they intersect.

1915
01:29:19,841 --> 01:29:21,173
Come on, Frank.

1916
01:29:21,909 --> 01:29:24,574
I may be a drunken little whore,
but at least I don't get into bed...

1917
01:29:24,579 --> 01:29:26,636
with men who kill people and steal for a living.

1918
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:27,370
Into bed?

1919
01:29:27,371 --> 01:29:28,597
How the Hell am I "into bed"?

1920
01:29:30,017 --> 01:29:32,248
Frankie, you're the biggest movie
star in the goddamn world.

1921
01:29:32,253 --> 01:29:34,310
But the minute those two-bit thugs call you up...

1922
01:29:34,311 --> 01:29:36,480
you fucking jump like an errand boy.

1923
01:29:36,624 --> 01:29:38,187
You don't turn your back on your friends.

1924
01:29:38,192 --> 01:29:40,108
Aw please. You cheated on your first wife.

1925
01:29:40,133 --> 01:29:40,883
You cheated on me.

1926
01:29:40,884 --> 01:29:42,084
What, we weren't your friends?

1927
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:45,738
When I was carrying,

1928
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:46,247
Come here.

1929
01:29:46,248 --> 01:29:48,183
When I was carrying your bags like a porter.

1930
01:29:48,269 --> 01:29:49,825
I never treated you like a porter.

1931
01:29:49,826 --> 01:29:51,306
When I was carrying your bags like a,

1932
01:29:52,106 --> 01:29:53,580
Those guys stuck by me!

1933
01:29:53,608 --> 01:29:55,890
They were the only ones who would help me out!

1934
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:56,773
What a load of crap.

1935
01:29:56,778 --> 01:29:58,459
Are you an artist or are you a thug?

1936
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,420
You don't know what the fuck you're talkin about!

1937
01:30:00,487 --> 01:30:01,670
You never know what you're talking about!

1938
01:30:01,671 --> 01:30:03,312
You never know what you're talking about!

1939
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,258
Shut up!

1940
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:12,282
Ava.

1941
01:30:13,595 --> 01:30:15,435
Ava, wait a minute. Wait. wait, wait!

1942
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,510
It's 3:00 in the morning. You can't drive home.

1943
01:30:17,632 --> 01:30:20,048
How many times have we been through this. Frank?

1944
01:30:20,835 --> 01:30:24,319
It's pathetic. It's pathetic.

1945
01:30:25,473 --> 01:30:28,406
You want to talk about pathetic? Huh?

1946
01:30:28,643 --> 01:30:30,142
You're drinking so much, your skin's starting

1947
01:30:30,242 --> 01:30:33,036
to feel like sandpaper, Ava. That's pathetic.

1948
01:30:39,153 --> 01:30:41,836
You are a bastard.

1949
01:30:58,479 --> 01:30:59,805
Ava.

1950
01:31:01,648 --> 01:31:02,357
Ava.

1951
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,318
Ava, Ava!

1952
01:31:05,694 --> 01:31:07,195
Ava, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1953
01:31:07,529 --> 01:31:08,238
Ava wait!

1954
01:31:10,852 --> 01:31:12,184
I'm sorry.

1955
01:31:13,193 --> 01:31:14,302
I'm sorry.

1956
01:31:15,523 --> 01:31:16,830
Okay, I didn't mean that.

1957
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:20,625
Frank.

1958
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:26,631
I love it when you sing...

1959
01:31:26,701 --> 01:31:28,300
because you're honest when you sing.

1960
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,514
You are an angel when you sing.

1961
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,604
Why don't you just sing?

1962
01:32:08,342 --> 01:32:09,590
Hey Frank, how's the president?

1963
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:10,873
He needs a vacation.

1964
01:32:10,878 --> 01:32:12,135
Freddy, give me my drink.

1965
01:32:13,347 --> 01:32:14,554
Did you read the script?

1966
01:32:14,949 --> 01:32:16,389
Amusing story about that.

1967
01:32:16,598 --> 01:32:18,058
I had Jack read it, see.

1968
01:32:18,419 --> 01:32:22,896
And, he says it's a remake of "Gunga Din."

1969
01:32:24,258 --> 01:32:25,464
If you don't like your part, Peter

1970
01:32:25,465 --> 01:32:27,150
we can always find another Englishman.

1971
01:32:27,528 --> 01:32:29,361
I didn't say that. Didn't say it.

1972
01:32:33,834 --> 01:32:35,075
When am I coming, Peter?

1973
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:37,452
It's been four months. He's making me look bad.

1974
01:32:37,939 --> 01:32:38,911
Working on that, Frank.

1975
01:32:38,912 --> 01:32:40,421
It's just a little different these days.

1976
01:32:40,422 --> 01:32:41,137
That's all

1977
01:32:41,142 --> 01:32:41,840
How's that?

1978
01:32:41,873 --> 01:32:44,416
Well, uh. You're still Frank Sinatra.

1979
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:47,087
But Jack's president now.

1980
01:32:47,115 --> 01:32:49,047
With a lot of help from me and my friends.

1981
01:32:49,117 --> 01:32:50,214
I realize that, but, uh

1982
01:32:50,215 --> 01:32:51,896
You go to the White House, don't ya Peter?

1983
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:54,386
Yeah, but not that often these days...

1984
01:32:55,623 --> 01:32:58,306
Oops, considering the crisis and everything.

1985
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,892
But it's family, Frank.

1986
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:02,936
And Joe treats you like a son, does he?

1987
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:07,982
Don't squirm.

1988
01:33:08,536 --> 01:33:09,859
I hate it when you squirm.

1989
01:33:11,339 --> 01:33:12,529
Yeah.

1990
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,447
Sometimes I'm not so sure, Frank.

1991
01:33:41,936 --> 01:33:43,727
Is she beautiful?

1992
01:33:55,783 --> 01:33:57,376
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

1993
01:33:57,452 --> 01:33:59,576
- No problems?
- No problems.

1994
01:34:00,054 --> 01:34:03,663
Judy, Judy, Judy. Well, what do you know?

1995
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,250
The hard-on stretches from Palm Springs
to the White House...

1996
01:34:07,295 --> 01:34:09,669
and all the way back here to Chicago.

1997
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,290
Peter frankly, I'm amazed you think you can

1998
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:50,932
walk into the office of the Attorney
General's with crap like this.

1999
01:34:52,006 --> 01:34:55,005
Whatever favors Giancana says he did on behalf

2000
01:34:55,006 --> 01:34:57,032
of the family, I'm going to act in the best

2001
01:34:57,033 --> 01:34:58,242
interest of this country, which means

2002
01:34:58,243 --> 01:34:59,676
ridding the nation, the likes of him,

2003
01:34:59,677 --> 01:35:02,180
Hoffa, Trafficante and all the rest.

2004
01:35:03,418 --> 01:35:04,891
This just came from Hoover.

2005
01:35:04,919 --> 01:35:06,648
Thanks.

2006
01:35:06,721 --> 01:35:07,977
That's all very well, Bobby.

2007
01:35:08,156 --> 01:35:11,772
But it's um, like banking, really.

2008
01:35:11,773 --> 01:35:13,900
Favor banking, you see?

2009
01:35:14,262 --> 01:35:15,567
You have to look at it from

2010
01:35:15,568 --> 01:35:17,195
- their point of view.
- Jesus!

2011
01:35:17,395 --> 01:35:18,946
They did us a favor,

2012
01:35:18,947 --> 01:35:20,907
now they want a favor in return.

2013
01:35:22,958 --> 01:35:23,737
Listen to me.

2014
01:35:23,738 --> 01:35:26,503
They may be a bunch of well-dressed nightclub

2015
01:35:26,574 --> 01:35:28,498
owners with cute nicknames to you, Peter.

2016
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:32,210
But the truth is they steal, they murder...

2017
01:35:32,347 --> 01:35:34,170
they extort and they corrupt.

2018
01:35:34,282 --> 01:35:36,129
And, I intend to ram the Washington Monument

2019
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,090
right up their rear ends. Understand?

2020
01:35:38,091 --> 01:35:39,175
Yeah.

2021
01:35:40,622 --> 01:35:43,304
Of course, I understand, Bobby.

2022
01:35:45,059 --> 01:35:47,183
Thanks for your time.

2023
01:35:49,564 --> 01:35:51,524
The Bay of Pigs continues to haunt the President.

2024
01:35:51,632 --> 01:35:53,138
With over fifteen hundred men

2025
01:35:53,139 --> 01:35:54,606
still rotting in a Cuban prison, the

2026
01:35:54,607 --> 01:35:56,942
war of words between Castro and the United States

2027
01:35:56,943 --> 01:35:58,552
United States grew even hotter today

2028
01:35:58,553 --> 01:36:00,362
as Castro lambasted the young president

2029
01:36:00,363 --> 01:36:01,906
as a naked aggressor.

2030
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:03,491
Give me some good news, Peter.

2031
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,111
Who's Frank sleeping with these days'?

2032
01:36:05,146 --> 01:36:07,638
Well, Ava came back for about five minutes.

2033
01:36:07,715 --> 01:36:09,272
I hear she's a formidable woman.

2034
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:10,279
Oh, if you only

2035
01:36:10,284 --> 01:36:11,165
Good morning, Evelyn.

2036
01:36:13,254 --> 01:36:14,695
Tell Frank we'll have him over soon.

2037
01:36:15,044 --> 01:36:17,964
Uh, that's good because he's uh. He's
been asking about that actually.

2038
01:36:18,114 --> 01:36:19,007
I'm sure he has.

2039
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:22,735
But Jackie doesn't want him in the house.

2040
01:36:23,498 --> 01:36:24,846
Thinks he's a bad influence.

2041
01:36:24,899 --> 01:36:26,121
Well maybe we could stuff him into one of

2042
01:36:26,122 --> 01:36:28,558
John John's diaper bags and smuggle him in, yeah.

2043
01:36:30,571 --> 01:36:33,395
I think uh, Jackie's out of town next month.

2044
01:36:33,396 --> 01:36:34,981
We could uh, have him up then.

2045
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:36,508
Have Eunice be the hostess.

2046
01:36:37,826 --> 01:36:39,736
Take him up to Hyannis Port, go for a sail.

2047
01:36:39,881 --> 01:36:42,113
Yeah, that's good. He'd like that.

2048
01:36:43,685 --> 01:36:45,045
It's good to see you again, Peter.

2049
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:49,662
Oh, Peter.

2050
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:50,463
Yes.

2051
01:36:50,491 --> 01:36:52,707
Say hello to you-know-who.

2052
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:57,253
Of course...

2053
01:36:58,199 --> 01:36:59,547
Mr. President.

2054
01:37:02,804 --> 01:37:05,261
Janet, find Bobby.

2055
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:24,238
Two fellas caught in a storm You and I.

2056
01:37:24,489 --> 01:37:25,939
Pick it up, Bill. Let's pick it up.

2057
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,532
Yeah.

2058
01:37:26,861 --> 01:37:29,535
Here's my umbrella.

2059
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:30,330
Yeah.

2060
01:37:30,495 --> 01:37:33,706
To keep you warm and dry.

2061
01:37:34,369 --> 01:37:36,150
Say. What about you?

2062
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,502
It's the least I can do.

2063
01:37:38,503 --> 01:37:40,755
Da do. Da you. Da da. Da do.

2064
01:37:40,842 --> 01:37:42,131
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like that.

2065
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:43,800
I like that. Yeah, that's wonderful.

2066
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:45,175
The, the G7 chord.

2067
01:37:45,176 --> 01:37:46,451
Can we go to the E on that?

2068
01:37:46,452 --> 01:37:48,929
Instead of the E flat? Make it a little brighter?

2069
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:53,101
It's the least I can do! Yeah.

2070
01:37:53,184 --> 01:37:54,394
It's wonderful, wonderful.

2071
01:37:55,223 --> 01:37:56,561
Oh, Charlie-Pentagon.

2072
01:37:56,562 --> 01:37:57,605
Hello, boys.

2073
01:37:57,814 --> 01:37:59,607
Let's pour us a drink, Frank.

2074
01:37:59,827 --> 01:38:02,402
Hey Peter. I'm gonna be a daddy.

2075
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:03,519
Hey, Hey!

2076
01:38:04,365 --> 01:38:07,281
Yeah, I just want them all to be
tall and healthy like you, baby.

2077
01:38:07,523 --> 01:38:09,200
I don't know. Looks like he's shrinking.

2078
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:10,910
Are you shrinking, Cedric?

2079
01:38:11,139 --> 01:38:13,621
No, I'm sailing, Frank. I'm just...

2080
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:15,822
I'm sailing through life
without a care in the world.

2081
01:38:18,312 --> 01:38:19,794
And on that note...

2082
01:38:21,049 --> 01:38:22,255
Mañana, Rats.

2083
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,584
Come on, Wiley. Let's take a ten.

2084
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,599
All right.

2085
01:38:35,143 --> 01:38:36,686
Divvy up. What's going on?

2086
01:38:36,978 --> 01:38:38,271
Well.

2087
01:38:38,465 --> 01:38:40,906
I'm starting to feel like a messenger boy Frank.

2088
01:38:40,907 --> 01:38:42,066
And I don't like it.

2089
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,766
That's the way to stand up for yourself.

2090
01:38:43,771 --> 01:38:44,986
What's the word, Peter?

2091
01:38:45,173 --> 01:38:46,420
The word is uh...

2092
01:38:47,806 --> 01:38:48,927
He wants you to come next month.

2093
01:38:48,932 --> 01:38:50,216
Ah, there you go!

2094
01:38:50,908 --> 01:38:52,326
Now you're singing in tune.

2095
01:38:52,947 --> 01:38:55,621
Okay, now uh. I got to get him something.

2096
01:38:56,284 --> 01:38:58,457
What should I get him? What should I get him?

2097
01:38:58,458 --> 01:38:59,958
Well, what do you get the man who has everything?

2098
01:38:59,959 --> 01:39:00,726
Hmm.

2099
01:39:02,357 --> 01:39:03,362
You can never have too much.

2100
01:39:03,363 --> 01:39:04,467
Peter, you should know that.

2101
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:05,239
Yeah. Well, uh.

2102
01:39:05,339 --> 01:39:07,007
Also, I had a chat with Bobby.

2103
01:39:08,096 --> 01:39:09,510
Told me to fuck off.

2104
01:39:16,504 --> 01:39:18,560
Do you realize the position that puts me in'?

2105
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:22,382
No, I... I don't want to know, Frank.

2106
01:39:22,477 --> 01:39:24,458
You see, I'm an actor. Frank

2107
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:26,419
I'm just an actor.

2108
01:39:27,115 --> 01:39:30,031
I'm not a messenger boy. Huh?

2109
01:39:30,051 --> 01:39:31,866
It's humiliating. Do you understand that?

2110
01:39:32,253 --> 01:39:33,592
I've got the President

2111
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:35,119
of the United States of America,

2112
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:38,455
passing messages through me to Marilyn Monroe who

2113
01:39:38,456 --> 01:39:40,499
Who happens to be drinking out of a flask.

2114
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,044
And then I've got uh, Bobby Kennedy,

2115
01:39:43,086 --> 01:39:44,753
who's passing messages through me to you...

2116
01:39:44,754 --> 01:39:46,171
and you're passing messages to Joe Kennedy.

2117
01:39:46,172 --> 01:39:47,339
You know. I just want to act, Frank,

2118
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:48,857
I just want to... I just want to act.

2119
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:50,393
And cheat on my wife.

2120
01:39:52,095 --> 01:39:53,779
Is it too much to ask?

2121
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:01,678
Is it too much to ask?

2122
01:40:04,252 --> 01:40:06,341
One minute he says he's talked to Bobby,

2123
01:40:06,342 --> 01:40:08,194
the next minute he says he hasn't.

2124
01:40:08,456 --> 01:40:10,117
It's a lot of shit.

2125
01:40:10,191 --> 01:40:11,589
Frank says to me, “Johnny...

2126
01:40:12,093 --> 01:40:13,657
I took Sam's name, I wrote it down,

2127
01:40:13,658 --> 01:40:15,259
I showed it to Bobby Kennedy.

2128
01:40:15,396 --> 01:40:17,285
I said, 'This guy is my buddy.

2129
01:40:17,286 --> 01:40:18,804
This is what I want you to know.”

2130
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,522
Well, he says he's gonna do a guy a favor.

2131
01:40:20,523 --> 01:40:21,933
Well, if he can't deliver...

2132
01:40:22,003 --> 01:40:23,667
he should come to me and say, John

2133
01:40:23,668 --> 01:40:25,152
“The load is too heavy.“

2134
01:40:25,153 --> 01:40:27,213
Then Frank will have to do you a little favor.

2135
01:40:28,943 --> 01:40:30,632
You see Kennedy and them guys?

2136
01:40:30,633 --> 01:40:32,318
They treat him like he's a whore.

2137
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:35,115
I say you go the other way, Mo. Fuck him.

2138
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:37,015
Let him see the other side of you.

2139
01:40:37,084 --> 01:40:38,073
Show these Hollywood Rats

2140
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:39,915
they can't do this like nothing ever happened.

2141
01:40:40,255 --> 01:40:42,470
Let's hit him. Let's hit Sinatra.

2142
01:40:44,459 --> 01:40:46,689
And I'll whack the rest of
those guys while I'm at it.

2143
01:40:46,761 --> 01:40:48,907
Lawford, Martin. That Fucking Munjal fruit.

2144
01:40:48,996 --> 01:40:51,092
I'll wipe that bad attitude right off his face.

2145
01:40:51,733 --> 01:40:52,885
And the nigger too.

2146
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:55,705
I'd take his other eye out. Bing, just like that!

2147
01:41:00,575 --> 01:41:02,206
So what do you think?

2148
01:41:02,743 --> 01:41:04,250
Let's whack them all.

2149
01:41:09,751 --> 01:41:13,259
Nah! I want to hear Frank sing "Chicago" again.

2150
01:41:14,522 --> 01:41:16,679
I love the way he does that.

2151
01:41:44,686 --> 01:41:46,714
Winch it up as tight as she'll go, Frank.

2152
01:41:50,591 --> 01:41:52,303
This is the ultimate, Jack.

2153
01:41:52,427 --> 01:41:54,472
Sailing under the presidential flag.

2154
01:41:56,063 --> 01:41:57,851
It's a long way from Hoboken.

2155
01:42:06,868 --> 01:42:08,269
Holding Marilyn is uh...

2156
01:42:08,962 --> 01:42:10,947
Like holding an ancient Roman vase.

2157
01:42:11,012 --> 01:42:12,056
You have to be careful

2158
01:42:12,057 --> 01:42:13,604
it doesn't turn to dust in your hands.

2159
01:42:13,614 --> 01:42:15,201
You're living dangerously, Jack.

2160
01:42:15,717 --> 01:42:17,536
Life is short Frank and uh...

2161
01:42:17,537 --> 01:42:19,372
Marilyn is so soft.

2162
01:42:20,555 --> 01:42:22,083
Her skin is like...

2163
01:42:22,483 --> 01:42:24,018
Electric velvet.

2164
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,173
Yes. Electric velvet.

2165
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:30,892
How's Ava?

2166
01:42:32,327 --> 01:42:33,631
Uh huh, Ava...

2167
01:42:34,888 --> 01:42:36,508
Ava is...

2168
01:42:36,509 --> 01:42:39,452
is bourbon sliding down your throat spreading

2169
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:42,479
it's wings in your chest like a butterfly.

2170
01:42:42,543 --> 01:42:44,308
She's pure heartache.

2171
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:47,570
I miss her even when I'm having her.

2172
01:42:47,759 --> 01:42:49,079
We're in the wrong racket, Frank.

2173
01:42:49,183 --> 01:42:51,078
We should spend our time in coffeehouses

2174
01:42:51,079 --> 01:42:52,315
singing the praises of women...

2175
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,798
like a couple of beatnik poets.

2176
01:42:55,457 --> 01:42:57,246
Listen, I'm gonna be out your way in March.

2177
01:42:57,343 --> 01:42:58,594
Think you can put me up?

2178
01:42:58,595 --> 01:43:00,741
I have a tad more baggage this time, however.

2179
01:43:00,829 --> 01:43:02,118
Are you kidding me?

2180
01:43:02,374 --> 01:43:04,209
I'll build a whole new wing for you Jack.

2181
01:43:04,309 --> 01:43:05,618
Of course I'll put you up.

2182
01:43:07,268 --> 01:43:08,922
That's fantastic. What about Bobby?

2183
01:43:09,503 --> 01:43:11,665
The Roman vase of presidential prerogative...

2184
01:43:11,739 --> 01:43:13,927
was still intact last time I checked.

2185
01:43:14,175 --> 01:43:16,137
I'll bring some Cuban cigars we'll...

2186
01:43:16,237 --> 01:43:18,681
sit around your pool...and forget about war

2187
01:43:18,781 --> 01:43:21,100
and racism and life's other perplexing irony.

2188
01:43:21,182 --> 01:43:22,810
That would be great, Jack.

2189
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:31,468
News flash!

2190
01:43:31,469 --> 01:43:33,446
Frank Sinatra is telling everyone in Hollywood...

2191
01:43:33,546 --> 01:43:34,997
that President Kennedy will use

2192
01:43:34,998 --> 01:43:36,783
Sinatra's Palm Springs estate...

2193
01:43:36,883 --> 01:43:38,576
as the Western White House.

2194
01:43:38,676 --> 01:43:40,828
All right this is gonna be Jack's. Right up here.

2195
01:43:41,436 --> 01:43:43,273
Sinatra has been absent from the

2196
01:43:43,373 --> 01:43:45,416
Washington scene since the inauguration.

2197
01:43:45,607 --> 01:43:46,579
And the Secret Service.

2198
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,470
Now were gonna build five
bungalows down on the hillside.

2199
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:51,166
Some say it's the Bay of Pigs fiasco

2200
01:43:51,167 --> 01:43:53,185
that has kept Sinatra from a presidential visit.

2201
01:43:53,681 --> 01:43:55,134
I want this done by March.

2202
01:43:55,234 --> 01:43:56,994
But this informed reporter says...

2203
01:43:56,995 --> 01:43:59,466
it's the First Lady who's none too fond of her

2204
01:43:59,467 --> 01:44:01,134
perennial bad boy, Francis Albert.

2205
01:44:01,135 --> 01:44:02,470
I want this done by March.

2206
01:44:07,194 --> 01:44:08,926
Good evening, Mr. President, General.

2207
01:44:08,997 --> 01:44:10,793
Good evening, Jefferson. How are you tonight?

2208
01:44:10,798 --> 01:44:13,481
Uh, very well, Sir. Looks like
you're fresh from a swim.

2209
01:44:13,595 --> 01:44:14,991
They say it's good for the back.

2210
01:44:15,069 --> 01:44:16,964
Jefferson. Do we have any pistachio?

2211
01:44:17,071 --> 01:44:19,870
Yes, I stocked up on it, Sir. Let me get it...

2212
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:21,530
No, here it is. Never mind.

2213
01:44:22,043 --> 01:44:22,954
Bobby.

2214
01:44:23,054 --> 01:44:25,373
How do you stand on mixing peach and chocolate?

2215
01:44:25,913 --> 01:44:27,684
Ah, I'm against it.

2216
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:29,979
Mr. President. I'd be more than
happy to prepare it for you.

2217
01:44:29,984 --> 01:44:31,231
You probably had a harder day than I have.

2218
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,917
Jefferson. Go to bed.

2219
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:36,016
Besides, don't tell the First Lady but my brother

2220
01:44:36,017 --> 01:44:38,094
likes to eat his ice cream right out of the tub.

2221
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:40,888
Bobby, make yourself useful, get the sprinkles.

2222
01:44:41,062 --> 01:44:43,148
I don't think that's in my purview.

2223
01:44:43,149 --> 01:44:43,822
I'll get it.

2224
01:44:43,932 --> 01:44:46,352
No, no, no. He's acting in a dual capacity.

2225
01:44:46,467 --> 01:44:48,020
I've just appointed the Attorney General

2226
01:44:48,021 --> 01:44:49,480
Secretary of Sprinkles as well.

2227
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,944
Spoons, Bobby, and a bowl for me.

2228
01:44:56,758 --> 01:44:58,125
Uh, General...

2229
01:45:00,248 --> 01:45:01,570
Good night, Jefferson.

2230
01:45:02,817 --> 01:45:04,444
Good night, Mr. President.

2231
01:45:04,519 --> 01:45:05,422
Good night, Jefferson.

2232
01:45:05,522 --> 01:45:06,456
Good night, General.

2233
01:45:10,024 --> 01:45:11,444
Ah, sprinkles.

2234
01:45:11,497 --> 01:45:14,332
So, where was I?

2235
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:16,566
Ice cream always seems so naked without sprinkles

2236
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:18,176
Pistachio?

2237
01:45:18,276 --> 01:45:21,095
Chocolate. Can we get back to this?

2238
01:45:21,195 --> 01:45:22,764
Yes, yes. I know.

2239
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:25,207
You've received a memo from the guardian

2240
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:26,851
of all that is right and decent.

2241
01:45:26,908 --> 01:45:28,802
A memo saying that a woman named

2242
01:45:28,803 --> 01:45:31,272
Judy Campbell has been seen with Giancana.

2243
01:45:32,146 --> 01:45:34,067
And, that they've traced several calls from her

2244
01:45:35,318 --> 01:45:37,189
to you in the Oval Office.

2245
01:45:37,652 --> 01:45:39,072
That evil old queer.

2246
01:45:39,987 --> 01:45:41,947
What's the matter? Isn't he getting his estrogen?

2247
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,530
You tell Hoover I've heard of a certain

2248
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:46,765
photograph of him and Clyde Tolson,

2249
01:45:46,766 --> 01:45:48,231
that might raise an eyebrow or two.

2250
01:45:48,329 --> 01:45:49,582
Jack, this is serious.

2251
01:45:49,682 --> 01:45:50,658
I am serious.

2252
01:45:50,732 --> 01:45:52,930
It has to stop Jack. Today!

2253
01:45:53,334 --> 01:45:54,945
How can we wield our moral

2254
01:45:54,946 --> 01:45:55,731
influence in Jackson, Mississippi...

2255
01:45:55,736 --> 01:45:57,125
when Hoover could be sharing this crap

2256
01:45:57,126 --> 01:45:58,586
with our enemies down there?

2257
01:46:02,043 --> 01:46:03,887
I also had a memo from Hoover saying he thinks

2258
01:46:03,888 --> 01:46:06,191
the C.I.A...may be plotting with Giancana

2259
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:10,019
and Trafficante to get Castro.

2260
01:46:13,855 --> 01:46:18,522
It's all about layers, Bobby, like a woman.

2261
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,655
Who wants a woman who just appears

2262
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:22,693
naked in your bed and spreads her legs?

2263
01:46:22,864 --> 01:46:24,487
Where's the sport in that?

2264
01:46:25,933 --> 01:46:28,574
No, the name of the game is hide-and-seek.

2265
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:31,334
You have to cover the prize with sprinkles...

2266
01:46:31,339 --> 01:46:33,787
and then, voila...

2267
01:46:34,976 --> 01:46:36,457
pistachio.

2268
01:46:40,348 --> 01:46:43,614
You can't stay at Sinatra's house in Palm Springs

2269
01:46:45,887 --> 01:46:48,344
Be pen pals, talk on the phone.

2270
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,792
The President of the United States can't sleep in

2271
01:46:50,793 --> 01:46:52,973
the same bed that Sam Giancana slept in.

2272
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:57,066
Not while I'm Attorney General.

2273
01:47:00,435 --> 01:47:02,733
You don't think he's changed the sheets, Bobby?

2274
01:47:15,516 --> 01:47:17,228
Fucking Kennedys!

2275
01:47:20,021 --> 01:47:21,883
Fucking Frank!

2276
01:47:29,831 --> 01:47:31,225
Good morning, Peter.

2277
01:47:31,325 --> 01:47:32,225
I want this done. I told you.

2278
01:47:32,226 --> 01:47:33,294
I'm on a deadline here.

2279
01:47:33,394 --> 01:47:34,264
- You know the deadline.
- Yes.

2280
01:47:34,265 --> 01:47:35,058
I know the deadline.You got it.

2281
01:47:35,063 --> 01:47:36,063
Let's get it done.

2282
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,647
Hey, hey! Brother-in-Lawford!

2283
01:47:37,648 --> 01:47:38,941
Here, take a look at this.

2284
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,218
Look, look. It looks great doesn't it?

2285
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:41,944
Looks great, uh...

2286
01:47:42,009 --> 01:47:43,528
You know George...George!

2287
01:47:43,529 --> 01:47:44,655
Get Peter some breakfast!

2288
01:47:45,012 --> 01:47:47,366
And this right up here. That's Jack's room.

2289
01:47:47,566 --> 01:47:48,575
Come on up, I'll show you.

2290
01:47:48,576 --> 01:47:50,411
So, I'm gonna have phone lines installed.

2291
01:47:50,453 --> 01:47:52,079
So each room is connected privately

2292
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,050
to the presidential suite.

2293
01:47:53,055 --> 01:47:54,415
So that will be great.

2294
01:47:54,515 --> 01:47:57,210
Yeah, fabulous Frank. It's absolutely fabulous.

2295
01:48:00,895 --> 01:48:02,756
Excuse me. Can you give us...

2296
01:48:02,757 --> 01:48:05,218
Take ten minutes, all right'? Just ten.

2297
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:08,020
What's the matter with you?

2298
01:48:08,021 --> 01:48:09,054
You look like you swallowed a stone.

2299
01:48:09,055 --> 01:48:09,839
What's going on?

2300
01:48:09,889 --> 01:48:11,171
I need a drink.

2301
01:48:13,475 --> 01:48:14,376
Mind if I have a drink?

2302
01:48:14,377 --> 01:48:16,067
I said yeah, hold your horses Bobby.

2303
01:48:16,077 --> 01:48:17,730
I'll get you a drink.

2304
01:48:21,716 --> 01:48:22,860
Uh...

2305
01:48:23,678 --> 01:48:25,171
Jack can't stay here next month.

2306
01:48:26,254 --> 01:48:28,825
The Secret Service says it's a bad security risk.

2307
01:48:31,259 --> 01:48:32,411
What?

2308
01:48:34,595 --> 01:48:35,915
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2309
01:48:36,015 --> 01:48:37,425
"A bad security risk"?

2310
01:48:37,525 --> 01:48:38,504
What are you talking about?

2311
01:48:38,509 --> 01:48:40,253
I've pleaded your case, Frank.

2312
01:48:40,453 --> 01:48:40,963
There's nothing...

2313
01:48:40,968 --> 01:48:41,921
Where's he gonna stay?

2314
01:48:42,021 --> 01:48:42,839
Bing's.

2315
01:48:43,005 --> 01:48:45,408
Crosby's? Crosby's a Fucking Republican!

2316
01:48:45,508 --> 01:48:46,392
How can he stay there?

2317
01:48:46,508 --> 01:48:47,885
I know, Frank!

2318
01:48:48,009 --> 01:48:50,455
I've spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars here Peter!

2319
01:48:50,555 --> 01:48:52,013
Everyone knows he's staying here!

2320
01:48:52,014 --> 01:48:53,291
I've argued your case Frank!

2321
01:48:53,358 --> 01:48:54,850
There's nothing I can do about it, okay?

2322
01:48:54,851 --> 01:48:55,810
Tell me the truth!

2323
01:48:56,384 --> 01:48:57,694
You tell me the goddamn truth!

2324
01:48:57,695 --> 01:48:59,115
Cause, what you're saying is bullshit!

2325
01:48:59,120 --> 01:48:59,988
You want to know the truth?

2326
01:48:59,989 --> 01:49:00,789
Tell me the truth!

2327
01:49:00,922 --> 01:49:02,150
Well, you know the truth!

2328
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:03,342
You know it.

2329
01:49:03,368 --> 01:49:05,152
Everybody knows the truth except for you and Jack

2330
01:49:05,153 --> 01:49:06,779
because you're so arrogant.

2331
01:49:06,938 --> 01:49:08,114
This is Bobby, isn't it?

2332
01:49:08,214 --> 01:49:08,655
No!

2333
01:49:08,656 --> 01:49:10,358
This is Bobby, that little motherfucker!

2334
01:49:10,431 --> 01:49:11,349
No, it's not Bobby.

2335
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:12,568
This is Bobby, that little Motherfuck...

2336
01:49:12,569 --> 01:49:13,196
It's you and Jack.

2337
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:14,703
After what I did for them?

2338
01:49:14,704 --> 01:49:16,163
After what their own fucking father

2339
01:49:16,164 --> 01:49:17,455
asked me to do for them?

2340
01:49:17,456 --> 01:49:18,340
You're both so arrogant you think...

2341
01:49:18,341 --> 01:49:19,749
the rules don't apply to you.

2342
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:21,209
Self-righteous motherfucker!

2343
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:21,704
They apply Frank!

2344
01:49:21,709 --> 01:49:22,944
The rules apply!

2345
01:49:22,945 --> 01:49:24,505
Jack doesn't want this! Does he?

2346
01:49:24,605 --> 01:49:25,964
No, Jack didn't want this!

2347
01:49:25,965 --> 01:49:27,045
You think that the rules...

2348
01:49:28,201 --> 01:49:29,744
Jack is my friend!

2349
01:49:29,844 --> 01:49:31,345
You arrogant son of a Bitch!

2350
01:49:34,088 --> 01:49:35,488
Are you gonna be staying at Bing's?

2351
01:49:36,567 --> 01:49:37,768
Are you staying at Bing's?

2352
01:49:37,868 --> 01:49:39,086
Are you staying at Bing's!

2353
01:49:39,087 --> 01:49:40,730
It's family, Frank.

2354
01:49:42,964 --> 01:49:43,757
Get out of here!

2355
01:49:43,758 --> 01:49:44,424
Get out!

2356
01:49:44,425 --> 01:49:45,026
Come on Frank!

2357
01:49:45,093 --> 01:49:45,860
Get out of here!

2358
01:49:45,902 --> 01:49:46,777
Get out!

2359
01:49:47,111 --> 01:49:48,153
Get out of here Peter!

2360
01:49:48,154 --> 01:49:49,530
That's it! It's over!

2361
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:50,990
Don't blame me!

2362
01:49:51,005 --> 01:49:51,765
Get out!

2363
01:49:51,766 --> 01:49:53,784
No more movies! No more nothing!

2364
01:49:53,884 --> 01:49:55,369
It isn't my fault!

2365
01:49:55,378 --> 01:49:56,871
Get, get out.

2366
01:49:57,564 --> 01:49:58,723
Get out of my house!

2367
01:49:59,123 --> 01:49:59,857
Get out!

2368
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:01,025
Get out!

2369
01:50:01,649 --> 01:50:03,194
Frank! What the Hell is going on?

2370
01:50:03,294 --> 01:50:04,420
C'mon Dean, say something!

2371
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,588
Frank, what's the problem Pally?

2372
01:50:06,589 --> 01:50:07,739
Stay out of it, Dean!

2373
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:08,532
Frank, please..

2374
01:50:08,533 --> 01:50:10,268
Sammy, don't you take his side.

2375
01:50:10,368 --> 01:50:11,636
Get out of here, Peter!

2376
01:50:11,644 --> 01:50:12,345
Get out of here!

2377
01:50:14,829 --> 01:50:15,740
Stop it!

2378
01:50:16,449 --> 01:50:17,994
No more hammering, no more nails, nothing!

2379
01:50:17,999 --> 01:50:20,058
Everybody out! You're fired!

2380
01:50:20,134 --> 01:50:21,229
John, it's over!

2381
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:23,413
Stop painting! Stop nails! No nothing!

2382
01:50:23,414 --> 01:50:25,975
Get out! All of you, get out!

2383
01:50:26,551 --> 01:50:27,118
Shut up!

2384
01:50:27,218 --> 01:50:27,835
He's crazy.

2385
01:50:27,886 --> 01:50:29,211
Get out of here. Get out!

2386
01:50:33,815 --> 01:50:35,009
We're all crazy

2387
01:50:35,426 --> 01:50:36,727
Don't fret, okay Peter?

2388
01:50:36,728 --> 01:50:38,179
He'll get over it. He will.

2389
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:43,601
No, not this time.

2390
01:50:44,792 --> 01:50:46,562
Peter. Come on, Babe.

2391
01:51:03,229 --> 01:51:04,372
Goddamn it!

2392
01:51:05,813 --> 01:51:08,542
Bobby, Goddamn Son of a Bitch!

2393
01:51:09,684 --> 01:51:11,277
You Fuckers!

2394
01:51:12,981 --> 01:51:14,090
God Damn it!

2395
01:51:33,541 --> 01:51:36,988
Goddamn you, Bobby!

2396

2397

2400
01:52:23,558 --> 01:52:27,461

01:52:27,528 --> 01:52:29,553

2402

<i>♫ We're drinking, my friend. ♫</i>

2403
01:52:39,073 --> 01:52:44,068
<i>♫ To the end of a brief episode. ♫</i>

2404
01:52:48,116 --> 01:52:52,216
<i>♫ Make it one for my baby. ♫</i>

2405

<i>♫ And one more for the road. ♫</i>

2406
01:53:04,031 --> 01:53:07,695

<i>♫ Can't you make the music. ♫</i>

2411
01:53:25,853 --> 01:53:30,120
<i>♫ Easy and sad. ♫</i>

2412
01:53:32,026 --> 01:53:35,223
We are confronted primarily with a moral issue.

2413
01:53:35,296 --> 01:53:36,923
It is as old as the Scriptures...

2414
01:53:36,998 --> 01:53:39,924
and is as clear as the American Constitution.

2415
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:41,188
The heart of the question is

2416
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:43,649
whether all Americans are to be afforded

2417
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:46,694
equal rights and equal opportunities

2418
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:49,656
If an American, because his skin is dark

2419
01:53:49,962 --> 01:53:52,289
cannot enjoy...a full and free life...

2420
01:53:52,523 --> 01:53:54,516
then who among us would be content

2421
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:56,685
to have the color of his skin changed...

2422
01:53:56,785 --> 01:53:58,145
and stand in his place?

2423
01:53:58,486 --> 01:54:00,397
Who among us would then be content

2424
01:54:00,573 --> 01:54:02,650
with the counsel's patience and delay?

2425
01:54:03,025 --> 01:54:05,689
And this nation, for all its hopes

2426
01:54:05,773 --> 01:54:09,126
and all its boasts, will not be fully free

2427
01:54:09,306 --> 01:54:11,467
until all its citizens are free.

2428
