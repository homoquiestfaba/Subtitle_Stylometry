her anymore money.

It used to sit smack-dab in
the middle of town square,

224
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,756
but it got damaged in the quake of '52.

225
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,056

to do all kinds of crazy
things when I was a kid.

242

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,186
and started to walk off
with the damn thing,

365
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,036
just like you told me to.

366
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,166
- And?

367
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,190
- And.

368
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,616
She's gonna hock her jewelry.

369
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,236
- See, I told ya she'd cave
if you took that thing.

370
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,386
It's Holden's favorite piece.

371
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,216
- Oh yeah?

372
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
- Yes.

373
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,610
- Speakin' of favorite pieces.

374
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,876
- Are you sure you
didn't enjoy it with her?

375
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,476
- No, no, no.

376
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,307
Pure torture.

377
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,736
I was in agony the whole time.

378
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,706
- Well, I think I better check
it just to be sure it's okay.

379
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,480
- Well if you think you ought to.

380
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,000
(ominous music)

381
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,010
(phone ringing)

382
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,196
- Hello?

383
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,366
- So, how'd it go at the pawn shop?

384
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,216
- I got your money.

385
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,047
- Great.

386
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:59,286
I can pick it up in about an hour.

387
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,606
- No.

388
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,547
I gotta go out.

389
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,616
I can't meet you 'til tonight.

390
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,026
- All right, fine, tonight then.

391
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,506
- And I don't want you
comin' by here anymore.

392
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,896
I wanna meet you someplace
else where no one will see us.

393
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,000
- Like where?

394
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,986
- The Gottchalk's parking
lot at 10 o'clock.

395
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,996
The north end where no one ever parks.

396
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,106
- What you got up your
sleeve there, Rachel?

397
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,336
She wants me to meet her in
a parking lot tonight at 10.

398
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,530
- That's fine.

399
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,456
What's she gonna do?

400
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,326
(gentle music)

401
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,350
- All right.

402
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,556
I'll meet you.

403
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,266
But I'm telling you right
now, you try anything...

404
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,276
- You just be sure and
bring the negatives.

405
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,880
(gentle music)

406
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,836
- She's up to somethin'.

407
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,126
- She's just playin' it safe.

408
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,416
- No, no, no, no, it's more than that.

409
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,336
- Well if it is, I'm sure she's
left me 20 messages already.

410
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
- I hope you're right.

411
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,656
- Look, I've known Rachel
since the fifth grade.

412
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,487
We're best friends.

413
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,296
She tells me everything.

414
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,706
She's up to something, I'll
know as soon as I call her back.

415
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,926
- Reminds me of that ol' sayin'.

416
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,476
- Which one?

417
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,886
- With friends like
you, who needs enemies.

418
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,956
- Oh, you know, stop
you're breakin' my heart.

419
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,446
She always lands on her feet.

420
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,436
She was head cheerleader,
homecoming queen.

421
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,586
She went out with the star quarterback.

422
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,700
- Damn, I bet you were a
wild-ass in high school.

423
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,700
- (sighs) Well Rachel's daddy
didn't like me much (laughs).

424
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,036
Thought I was a bad influence.

425
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,640
- Yeah and were ya?

426
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,056
- Every chance I got.

427
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,887
- Uh huh.

428
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:54,646
- That's why she hung out with me.

429
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,670
She could do any crazy thing
she wanted and blame me for it.

430
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,696
You know I used to go
out with her husband.

431
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,527
That's right.

432
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:12,550
I was Holden Avery's girl until
I introduced him to Rachel.

433
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,426
- Tough break.

434
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,267
- Yeah.

435
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,626
- So as far as I'm concerned, she owes me.

436
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,240
(bright music)

437
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,566

439
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,530
- I checked the odometer.

440
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,426
Hey, take it easy, will ya?

441
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,896
I just fixed that thing.

No, not yet.

452

I don't know.

- Fairfield Investigations.

458
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,116
- This is Holden Avery.

459
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,206
She's on the phone with him right now.

460
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,506
- Mr. Avery, I've been tracking your wife

461
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,036
for almost a year now

462
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,036
and if she's got some stud in her corral,

463
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,236
she's keepin' him well hid

464
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,376
because I haven't caught her with no one.

465
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
So far.

466
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,616
- Well maybe she's just
a little more devious

467
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,646
than you give her credit for.

468
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,836
- Well maybe, but my motto is,

469
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,360
if it ain't broke,

470
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,336
don't fix it.

471
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,536
- Quaint.

472
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,956
She'll be dropping me off at the airport

473
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,927
in less than an hour.

474
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:51,716
Pick her up there.

475
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,266
- [Clay] You're the boss.

476
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,506
- Good.

477
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,216
I want you to keep her
under constant surveillance

00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,346

548
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,656
- You're late.

549
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,446
Where were you?

550
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,220
- Where do you think?

551
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,316
- Then he's dead?

552
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,926
- And Travis' fingerprints
are on the photos

553
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,146
and the murder weapon.

554
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,856
- He's out in the middle of
nowhere without an alibi.

555
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,036
- How 'bout you?

556
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,036
- He was still here,
scribblin' on his notepad

557
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,326
when you showed up.

558
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,277
- Perfect.

559
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:16,476
Perfect.

560
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,146
He should be finding the body any minute.

561
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,486
When the police get there
and see the photographs,

562
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,916
they're gonna think that Travis
tried to blackmail Holden,

563
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,706
and when Holden refused, he killed him.

564
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,886
- Are you sure they won't suspect me?

565
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,586
I mean after all I'm the one
inheritin' all the money.

566
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,146
- Holden hired the detective, not you.

567
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,736
He's gonna say that you
were sittin' at the bar

568
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,856
having a drink at the time of the murder.

569
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,716
- Did you really do it naked?

570
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,626
- Well bloody clothes
are hard to get rid of.

571
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,156
It took me two minutes to hose off

572
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,590
the evidence and get dressed.

573
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,496
- That's what Holden gets
for not trustin' me, huh?

574
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,566
- Yeah, he was even obliging enough

575
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:00,086
to leave a message on my machine.

576
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,360
You have the perfect alibi.

577
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,940
- We're really gonna get
away with it, aren't we?

578
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,076
- It's too bad about Travis, though.

579
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,350
He's a great lay, isn't he?

580
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,016
- Yeah.

581
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,200
You were right about that.

582
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,696
- But not as good as me.

583
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Right?

584
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,800
(gentle music)

585
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,336
Say it.

586
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,950
(gentle music)

587
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,217
Say it.

588
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:42,820
(gentle music)

589
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,560
- Not as good as you.

590
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,346
No one's ever been as good as you.

591
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,950
(gentle music)

592
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,820
(clock ticking)

593
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,596
- [Waitress] Oh, the drinks have already

594
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,986
been taken care of, ma'am,
by the gentleman at the bar.

595
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,196
♪ You know what they do so tell me ♪

596
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,236
♪ Tell me 'cause I don't know ♪

597
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,216
- Carla, I don't think I
can go through with this.

598
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,276
- You can and you will.

599
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,726
I'm the one who has to do the hard part.

600
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,726
All you have to do is sleep with him.

601
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,556
- No, I can't.

602
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,447
I can't, Carla.

603
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:24,050
I can't. - Sh sh sh.

604
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,506
- Howdy.

605
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,530
I'm Travis.

606
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,506
- [Carla] Here's your purse.

607
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,316
- Maybe I should go, too.

608
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
- Rachel.

609
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,836
You're doin' great.

610
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,386
Don't let me down now, okay?

611
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,916
Besides, he's a great lay.

612
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,520
(gentle music)

613
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,106
♪ You're my solid rock ♪

614
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,790
(ominous music)

615
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,236
- [Waitress] Can I get
you another round, ladies?

616
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,510
It's last call.

617
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,167
- No thanks.

618
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:19,586
I think we're gonna call it a night.

619
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,190
(gentle music)

620
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,060
Okay, let's go get the tragic news.

621
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,636
- Well, where is everybody?

622
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,516
(ominous music)

623
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,347
- I don't know.

624
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:57,966
This place should be swarming with cops.

625
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,356
Unless the detective didn't find the body.

626
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,606
- You remembered to leave
the door unlocked, right?

627
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,300
(ominous music)

628
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,806
It's locked, Car.

629
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,536
It's locked.

630
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,256
- It was open when I left.

631
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,940
(ominous music)

632
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,396
Don't touch anything.

633
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,237
We have to come back in the morning.

634
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:34,246
Let the maid find the body.

635
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,930
(ominous music)

636
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,050
- Where is he?

637
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,657
- I don't know.

638
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:56,180
He was right here.

639
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,246
- Well maybe he wasn't dead.

640
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,056
Maybe after you left, he
managed to call an ambulance.

641
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,957
- Oh right, and they tidied up

642
00:45:02,981 --> 00:45:04,216
before they took him to the hospital?

643
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,826
There was blood everywhere and
that thing was right there.

644
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,086
- Well what happened?

645
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,146
- I don't know.

646
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,536
Just let me think, okay?

647
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,310
- Carla, I got a real
bad feelin' about this.

648
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,080
(phone ringing)

649
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,926
- Hello?

650
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,807
- [Carla] Travis?

651
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,016
- Carla, where the fuck are you?

652
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,396
- I got restless and I went for a drink.

653
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,226
Why?

654
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,067
How did it go?

655
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:34,236
- I told you that bitch
was up to something.

656
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,266
- What do you mean?

657
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,380
- She didn't show, Carla.

658
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,906
So I went out to her house.

659
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,680
(engine roaring)

660
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,210
Son of a bitch, I knew
we couldn't trust her.

661
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,630
(ominous music)

662
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,820
(tires screeching)

663
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,220
(suspenseful music)

664
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:52,950
Rachel?

665
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,820
(suspenseful music)

666
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,426
Come out, come out wherever you are.

667
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,450
(suspenseful music)

668
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,107
(doorbell ringing)

669
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:46,130
(suspenseful music)

670
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,246
(doorbell ringing)

671
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,270
(suspenseful music)

672
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,550
(gentle music)

673
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,576
(car horn beeping)

674
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,180
(gentle music)

675
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,870
(suspenseful music)

676
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,316
I think I pretty much got
the blood out of everything

677
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,486
except I couldn't get it
out of this oriental rug

678
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,146
and a couple of files.

679
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,626
Then I dumped his body out by the lake

680
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,146
where we go skinny-dipping.

681
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,186
Made it look like a mugging.

682
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,756
I took the rug and the files

683
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,616
and I burned them in my barbecue pit.

684
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,206
- Nobody saw you?

685
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,066
- No, no, I don't think so.

686
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,466
But some guy saw my
truck in their driveway.

687
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:31,377
- What guy?

688
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:32,406
- I don't know what guy.

689
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,430
Some guy.

690
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,216
I think he saw my license plate.

691
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Oh man.

692
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,350
I am so screwed.

693
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,006
- Don't panic, okay?

694
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:43,957
I'll figure out something.

695
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:46,236
Just sit tight 'til I get there, okay?

696
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,260
- Just hurry, all right.

697
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,786
Hey.

698
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:51,810
- Hm?

699
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,060
- I love you.

700
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,330
- I love you, too.

701
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,706
- What did he say?

702
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,310
- We gotta get out to the lake.

703
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,230
(ominous music)

704
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,996
Come on and grab his legs.

705
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,516
- Oh my god, look at his head.

706
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,357
- Don't be such a priss.

707
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:40,036
You knew I was gonna bash him.

708
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,386
- I know, but how many times?

709
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,536
- I wasn't exactly keeping count.

710
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,896
Now will you get down here and help me?

711
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,590
(ominous music)

712
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:56,716
- Ugh.

713
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,776
- Oh come on.

714
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,926
- [Rachel] I just take it?

715
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:59,766
- Yeah.

716
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:00,790
Go.

717
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,636
- [Rachel] Ah.

718
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,976
- [Carla] Don't worry about your pants.

719
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,966
Just go.

720
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,990
Come on.

721
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,336
- God.

722
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,376
- Okay.

723
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,070
(ominous music)

724
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

725
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,620
What's going on?

726
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,396
Why won't it close?

727
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,000
- Okay, wait, wait.

728
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,660
Oh.

729
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,516
His finger's stuck in the lock.

730
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,846
I think we broke it.

731
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,636
- What, the lock or his finger?

732
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,830
- This ain't funny, Carla.

733
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,316
What're we doin' here, Carla?

734
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,297
What the hell are we doin'?

735
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:58,726
- Would you keep your eyes on the road?

736
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,576
You're swerving all over hell's half-acre.

737
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,276
- You said that nothing could go wrong.

738
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,966
You said absolutely
nothing could go wrong.

739
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,616
- Nothing has yet.

740
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,406
Okay, you still have an air-tight alibi

741
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,096
at the time of the murder.

742
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,716
All we have to do is
get Holden's body back

743
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,046
to where it was so that the
maid can find it in the morning.

744
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,186
It's even better than we planned.

745
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:20,986
- (scoffs) Better?

746
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,456
Better?

747
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,496
How could this possibly be better?

748
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,956
- That detective saw Travis'
car in your driveway,

749
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,456
which puts him smack-dab
at the scene of the crime.

750
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,297
Okay?

751
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:32,806
He's gonna fry for the murder.

752
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,830
Not you.

753
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,526
- You really think it's gonna work?

754
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,706
- Yes, Rachel.

755
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,537
Trust me, okay?

756
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:44,876
I've got everything under control.

757
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,767
- Okay.

758
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,036
(sirens blaring)

759
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,726
(gentle music) (sirens blaring)

760
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,567
- Don't panic.

761
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:51,616
Just don't.

762
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,766
Don't panic.

763
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,526
Just pull over to the side of the road

764
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,646
and we'll just see what they want.

765
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:00,260
(gentle music)

766
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,166
- Evenin', Deputy.

767
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,296
- Ma'am.

768
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,400
May I see your driver's
license and registration?

769
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,490
- Here's my license.

770
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,376
And here's my registration.

771
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,476
- Thank you, ma'am.

772
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,646
Mrs. Avery?

773
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,966
- Mm-hm.

774
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,426
- Now the reason I pulled you over

775
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,556
is you were weaving
quite a bit back there.

776
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,826
Have you ladies been drinkin' tonight?

777
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,657
- Well...

778
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:54,826
- We had a drink at a bar,
but it was a long time ago.

779
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,326
- All the same, I'm afraid I'm gonna have

780
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,770
to ask you to step out of the car, ma'am.

781
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,280
Back here, ma'am, away from the road.

782
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,926
(ominous music)

783
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,386
- She's not drunk, if
that's what you're thinking.

784
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,410
- Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to be quiet.

785
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:22,736
Now Mrs. Avery, I want you
to put your feet together

786
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,606
and stand with your arms
outstretched like this.

787
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:27,436
- [Rachel] Like this?

788
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,297
- That's fine.

789
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:33,226
Now I want you to lean your
head back and close your eyes.

790
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,956
Now, I want you to bend your right arm

791
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,216
and touch the tip of your
nose with your index finger.

792
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,910
(ominous music)

793
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,666
Okay, now your left arm.

794
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,270
(gentle music)

795
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,340
- She did it.

796
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,930
She passed, right?

797
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:02,656
- Mrs. Avery, I'd like for you
to do one more thing for me.

798
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,076
I'd like for you to let your
friend drive just to be safe.

799
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,100
- Of course.

800
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,770
- Whatever you say, officer.

801
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,876
(ominous music)

802
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,706
- Whoa.

803
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,547
Whoa.

804
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:18,980
Hold on a minute.

805
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,487
- Yes sir?

806
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:24,496
- There's somethin'
stickin' out of your trunk.

807
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,256
(ominous music)

808
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,206
- Oh yeah.

809
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,036
That's a.

810
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:28,966
It's just an old shower curtain.

811
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,917
It's nothing.

812
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:32,796
- Well maybe so, but it's
hanging over this one taillight.

813
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,386
That could be a hazard.

814
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,750
You best pop it back inside.

815
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,816
- I have to get the key.

816
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,510
(ominous music)

817
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,546
God.

818
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:51,240
(ominous music)

819
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,677
There ya go.

820
00:56:59,701 --> 00:57:01,156
Have a good night.

821
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,180
- Ma'am.

822
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,340
(ominous music)

823
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,236
Can I give ya a hand with that, ma'am?

824
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,067
- No, no.

825
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:16,596
It's no problem.

826
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,186
We don't wanna be any more trouble.

827
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,756
- It's no trouble really.

828
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,450
(ominous music)

829
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,526
Looks like you got it.

830
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,826
- Yeah.

831
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,106
Yeah, looks like it.

832
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:37,550
Have a goodnight.

833
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,570
(engine roaring)

834
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,976
How ya doin', you okay?

835
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,606
- I think I peed my pants.

836
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,266
- I know I peed my pants.

837
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,870
(gentle music)

838
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:15,410
Here we go.

839
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,770
Okay.

840
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,246
Okay, you get the door.

841
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,860
I'll get the trunk.

842
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,546
- [Anne] Daddy?

843
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:36,570
- Anne.

844
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,540
What are you doing here?

845
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,480
- Is my dad with you?

846
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,340
(clock ticking)

847
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,896
- [Announcer] Flight 501 from Bakersfield

848
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,496
is now arriving at gate two.

849
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,520
- Hey Daddy.

850
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,070
- Anne.

851
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,736
You didn't have to meet me here.

852
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,696
I told you, we're having lunch tomorrow.

853
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,697
- I know.

854
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:07,456
I just thought that since we haven't

855
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,686
seen each other in so long,
we'd have dinner tonight too.

856
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:11,776
- I have an appointment with an attorney

857
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,566
in less than an hour.

858
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:14,397
- All night?

859
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:15,696
- Then I have another appointment.

860
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,527
- With who?

861
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:17,556
- With whom.

862
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,580
- Whom.

863
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,596
- Look, I'm registered at the Regent.

864
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,836
So come by tomorrow around one o'clock.

865
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,667
- Dad...

866
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:25,940
- Anne, please.

867
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:28,530
Do as I ask.

868
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,210
Please.

869
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,320
(ominous music)

870
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,176
I already know it's bad.

871
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,036
Just need to know how bad.

872
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,926
- [Doctor] We're making new
breakthroughs every day,

873
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,006
discovering new treatments...

874
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:53,030
- Doctor, I don't need
the inspirational speech.

875
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:57,030
I just need to know how long I have.

876
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,810
- [Doctor] Three to six months.

877
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,996
- At least get a second opinion.

878
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,726
Have you talked to Dr. Medina back home?

879
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,667
- No.

880
01:00:13,691 --> 01:00:15,196
I don't want Rachel to know about this.

881
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,220
- Why not?

882
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:22,090
- Because I intend to
divorce her before I die.

883
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,160
- What?

884
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,246
- It's the only way I can
leave everything to you

885
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,726
without her being able to contest it.

886
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,226
- Daddy, I don't care about your money.

887
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,670
- Yeah, but I do.

888
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,470
She's been having an affair.

889
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,400
- With whom?

890
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,516
- I don't know yet.

891
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:51,096
But I think it's been going on
since before we were married.

892
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,370
- Are you sure?

893
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,396
- I've suspected it for a long time.

894
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,756
And just as soon as I can prove it,

895
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,226
the prenuptial allows me to dump her

896
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,546
without giving her one red cent.

897
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,996
- Daddy, this is crazy.

898
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:12,020
Why can't you just stay and
visit for just a couple of days?

899
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,596
- I have an important meeting,
one I cannot afford to miss.

900
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:21,200
I'll call you in a few days,
when everything's settled.

901
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,130
- Daddy?

902
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,950
I love you.

903
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,250
- Believe it or not.

904
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,416
I love you, too.

905
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,020
(gentle music)

906
01:01:57,790 --> 01:01:58,717
- Hi.

907
01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:01,016
When's your next flight to Bakersfield?

908
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,336
(clock ticking)

909
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,246
(phone ringing) (clock ticking)

910
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:10,600
Still no answer.

911
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,996
That's it, I'm calling the police.

912
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,296
(dish clanking)

913
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,576
- They won't do anything until
he's missing for 24 hours.

914
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,416
I'm sure he's fine.

915
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,136
- Then why doesn't he answer the phone?

916
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,446
- Well maybe he's just really busy

917
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,856
or maybe the meeting's
not even in his office.

918
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,646
If it'll make you feel better,

919
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,596
we'll take a drive down to
his office and check on him.

920
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,476
- That's a good idea.

921
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,317
That's a good idea.

922
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:40,706
- Actually, I think that
somebody should stay here

923
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,876
in case he calls or comes by.

924
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,560
(clock ticking)

925
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,806
- Yeah.

926
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:50,830
Okay.

927
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,190
- Come on, Rachel.

928
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,966
- Now what're we doin'?

929
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,046
- I've got an idea.

930
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,306
It's even better than we planned.

931
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,786
Oh just shut up and drive.

932
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,810
I'll tell ya on the way.

933
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,460
(ominous music)

934
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,036
- [Rachel] So what's the plan?

935
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,786
- First we have to go back
to the bar and get my car.

936
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,146
Then, you can follow me
out to Travis' cabin,

937
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,686
but turn off your headlights and stay back

938
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,246
so he doesn't see you.

939
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,296
He's probably been drinking and
he's bound to be freaked out

940
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,596
'cause I've been gone so long.

941
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:41,846
He'll wanna know where the
hell have you been, Carla?

942
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,756
And I'll tell him my
battery died or something

943
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,707
and it took me forever to get a jump.

944
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:47,196
And then I'll say something like.

945
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,027
It's freezing.

946
01:03:48,051 --> 01:03:49,326
Come on, let's go inside.

947
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,930
(gentle music)

948
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,726
Once we're inside, you pull
up and park out of sight

949
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,946
over by the generator shed.

950
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,640
(ominous music)

951
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,036
And then sneak up to the
front of the cabin on foot.

952
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,730
There you'll see a
wheelbarrow and a shovel.

953
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,626
You can use the wheelbarrow
to move Holden's body

954
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,026
from your trunk to the
back of Travis' jeep.

955
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,726
And don't worry, it won't be locked.

956
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,166
It never is.

957
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:32,666
But first, use the shovel
to scrap up his fender

958
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:37,316
and side panel and be sure
you don't make too much noise.

959
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,876
Then go find a phone booth.

960
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,206
Make an anonymous 911 call.

961
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:43,156
Give them Travis' license plate number

962
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,126
and say you saw him hit a
parked car and take off.

963
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,776
I'll get Travis into
bed and then get myself

964
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,880
out of there before the cops show up.

965
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,686
How much of that have you had?

966
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:58,066
- [Travis] About this much.

967
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,996
- Well maybe you should lie
down and try and get some sleep.

968
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,827
- What are you stupid?

969
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:07,476
I'm about this close to
the gas chamber right now.

970
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,556
- Well you dumped the body

971
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:12,436
and you wiped up all the evidence, right?

972
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,346
Then you've got nothing to worry about.

973
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,756
If the cops go after anybody,
they're gonna go after Rachel.

974
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,516
She's the one with motive.

975
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,556
I mean you've never even met the man.

976
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,896
- What about the guy who saw my truck?

977
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,976
- What about him?

978
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,706
You're not the only guy in
Bakersfield who drives a jeep.

979
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:30,706
- Hey genius, he saw my license plate.

980
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,400
- He made a mistake.

981
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,610
You were here with me all night.

982
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,726
It's his word against ours.

983
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,840
- Yeah right.

984
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,830
You got all the answers, don't you?

985
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,760
- Sometimes.

986
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,166
- Oh you should've seen him, baby.

987
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:58,416
The way his skull was all caved in.

988
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,556
It was a god-awful sight.

989
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,250
- [Carla] It's okay.

990
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,327
It's over now, okay?

991
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:05,930
It's gonna be fine.

992
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,206
- The man is dead, Carla.

993
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,836
It's not gonna be fine.

994
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,616
- Yes it is.

995
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,436
I'll take care of it, I promise.

996
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,460
Okay?

997
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:50,560
(gentle music) (people groaning)

998
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,360
- [Travis] Carla.

999
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,670
- Wait.

1000
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,716
What the hell are you doing?

1001
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,990
What are you trying to ruin everything?

1002
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,096
- [Rachel] Is he dead?

1003
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,120
- No.

1004
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,116
No thanks to you.

1005
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,436
- You had to screw him
one last time, didn't you?

1006
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,287
- Don't be stupid.

1007
01:07:59,311 --> 01:08:01,836
I was just trying to wear him
out so he'd pass out quicker.

1008
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,206
- Don't give me that shit.

1009
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,746
You may get away with
treating your men like this,

1010
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:06,266
but I won't stand for it.

1011
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,097
Do you hear me?

1012
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:08,106
- Yeah, I hear you.

1013
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,816
You sound like a jealous old harping wife.

1014
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,836
- You just remember who's
inheriting all the money.

1015
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,276
- You just remember who
set this whole thing up,

1016
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,346
who went to every stinkin'
tractor pull and rodeo

1017
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,966
looking for just the right guy.

1018
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,506
Do you know how many assholes I had

1019
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:22,576
to let slobber all over me
until I finally found Travis?

1020
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,896
- Yeah and I'm sure it
was a real sacrifice

1021
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,506
for someone with your
high moral upbringing.

1022
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,326
- What's that supposed to mean?

1023
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:29,966
- You put out for every
boy in high school,

1024
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,836
including your own brothers.

1025
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,546
- I don't need this shit.

1026
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,570
- Carla.

1027
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,986
Carla, I'm sorry.

1028
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:40,817
Okay?

1029
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:41,926
I didn't mean it.

1030
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:43,870
You know that I didn't.

1031
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:48,100
The money doesn't mean anything to me.

1032
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,320
I'm sorry.

1033
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,920
- Well let's go get Holden.

1034
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,806
(ominous music)

1035
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,910
Jesus Christ.

1036
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:16,526
- Now what?

1037
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:19,210
(ominous music)

1038
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:39,736
- Good enough.

1039
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,637
Okay.

1040
01:09:40,661 --> 01:09:43,166
You check the road from here to the cabin

1041
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,846
and I'm gonna backtrack to your house.

1042
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:46,156
Holden's gotta be someplace in between.

1043
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,046
- Carla, I don't think I can keep this up.

1044
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,526
- Rachel.

1045
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:53,016
Don't fold on me now.

1046
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,696
We're almost home.

1047
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,816
We're almost home, okay?

1048
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,956
Please?

1049
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,560
(gentle music)

1050
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,470
(soft music)

1051
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,700
- Carla?

1052
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,610
(gentle music)

1053
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:20,070
(soft music)

1054
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:32,440
(dramatic music)

1055
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,110
(gentle music)

1056
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:16,700
- Oh god.

1057
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:17,296
(suspenseful music)

1058
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,980
(clock ticking)

1059
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,800
(gentle music)

1060
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:58,330
(phone ringing) (gentle music)

1061
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,276
- [Clay] You've reached
Fairfield Investigations.

1062
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,416
You know what to do.

1063
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,257
Wait for it.

1064
01:14:03,281 --> 01:14:04,336
(phone beeping)

1065
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,586
- [Anne] Mr. Fairfield,
my name is Anne Avery.

1066
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,770
My father is missing and...

1067
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,426
- Hello, Miss Avery?

1068
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,076
- Mr. Fairfield.

1069
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,346
- Yes ma'am.

1070
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,346
What's this about your father missing?

1071
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,596
- That's right.

1072
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,236
For quite some time now.

1073
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,446
And it says here he had
a 10:30 meeting with you?

1074
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,720
- He missed it.

1075
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,146
- I knew it.

1076
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:30,977
I knew it.

1077
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:32,746
Something's happened to him.

1078
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,146
- Well now, don't go
jumpin' to conclusions.

1079
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,716
Where are ya?

1080
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,496
- [Anne] My father's house.

1081
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,716
- All right, give me some
time to get myself together

1082
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:45,366
and I'll be out there
in less than an hour.

1083
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:46,346
- Thanks.

1084
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:47,370
Bye.

1085
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:14,280
(ominous music)

1086
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,756
- Little bit late for
a ride in the country,

1087
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,196
isn't it Mrs. Avery?

1088
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:55,606
Your husband there looks dead on his feet.

1089
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:56,800
Hands, please.

1090
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,550
(gentle music)

1091
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:33,560
(phone dialing)

1092
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,846
(phone ringing)

1093
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,346
Hello, Sheriff's Office?

1094
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:41,210
Hello?

1095
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,066
Damn piece of shit.

1096
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:46,796
I just fixed this the other day.

1097
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,166
Ah, here we go.

1098
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:48,997
Yeah, hello?

1099
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,936
Yeah, I thought I lost
you there for a second.

1100
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,066
My name's Clay Fairfield.

1101
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,966
I used to be on the force.

1102
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,936
Now I'm a P.I.

1103
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,266
I just uncovered a.

1104
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,616
(woman screaming)

1105
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,560
(tires screeching)

1106
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,830
- Carla, is that you?

1107
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,016
- Who'd you think it would be, Rachel?

1108
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,040
The goddamned auto club?

1109
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:19,700
- Is he dead?

1110
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:24,866
- Well I damn-near hit
him at 50 miles an hour.

1111
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,707
- What're you doing?

1112
01:17:25,731 --> 01:17:26,996
Let's get out of here.

1113
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,826
- Oh, you can drive like that?

1114
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,600
With your hands behind your back?

1115
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,190
Come on.

1116
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,166
- Oh my god.

1117
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:57,486
He was my alibi, Carla.

1118
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:00,126
You just ran over my alibi.

1119
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,916
- I already thought of that.

1120
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:04,866
He wrote everything down
in this stupid little book.

1121
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:06,376
See look, it says he
watched you at the bar

1122
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,570
until he went to meet Holden at 10:30.

1123
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:11,930
Oh my god.

1124
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,466
This is even better than we planned.

1125
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,356
- You keep saying that but I don't see it.

1126
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,466
- It says that Anne called
and said Holden was missing.

1127
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:22,576
He suspects Travis.

1128
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,756
So when the cops find him,

1129
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:26,306
they'll think that Travis
killed him and Holden both.

1130
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:30,080
We just have to make
sure the cops find this.

1131
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:03,850
Ready?

1132
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,027
Okay, ready?

1133
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,146
One.

1134
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,346
Two, three.

1135
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:21,120
(dramatic music)

1136
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,470
- You stinkin' bitch.

1137
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:29,746
You just been settin'
me up this whole time.

1138
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:33,776
Well now I got myself a little
bit of a dilemma, don't I?

1139
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,216
Should I kill you first?

1140
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,546
Or maybe you, huh?

1141
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,876
- Oh, way to go, Rachel.

1142
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,066
My grandmother could've knocked him out

1143
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:42,696
for longer than that.

1144
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,246
- This is my fault?

1145
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:46,456
- Well it's not my fault.

1146
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,397
- I cannot believe.

1147
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:48,926
- Oh, don't even start whining.

1148
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:49,786
- I let you talk me into this.

1149
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:50,617
- You know something?

1150
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:52,736
You are the biggest whiny spoiled brat.

1151
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:53,567
- Shut up.

1152
01:19:53,591 --> 01:19:55,156
Shut the fuck up.

1153
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,246
- Don't, don't.

1154
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:58,930
(ominous music)

1155
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:03,890
Take his gun.

1156
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,026
Take his gun, Rachel.

1157
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,710
(ominous music)

1158
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,396
- Now what?

1159
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:18,227
- I don't know.

1160
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:19,776
Let me think.

1161
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,667
- Well make it fast.

1162
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,440
The sun's gonna be up any minute.

1163
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,930
- Okay, I got it.

1164
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,596
We'll take him deep into the woods

1165
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,466
and bury him where the
cops will never find him.

1166
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:35,486
And then they'll just
think that he got away.

1167
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,726
- Hey, come on, Carla.

1168
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,336
Look, you don't have
to do that, all right?

1169
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,966
You don't have to do that.

1170
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:44,196
You just let me go, you'll
never see me again, I promise.

1171
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,416
- Okay, just shut up.

1172
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,520
Just shut up.

1173
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,476
Do you think it'll work?

1174
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,686
- Yeah.

1175
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:56,710
Your alibi's still perfect
and with him out of the way,

1176
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,180
the frame-up's even stronger.

1177
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,560
(laughs) It's almost better
than we planned (laughs).

1178
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:08,686
- Yeah.

1179
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:09,710
It is.

1180
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:16,330
- I know you're not gonna
believe this but I'm sorry.

1181
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,486
I'm sorry.

1182
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,096
- Don't do this, Carla.

1183
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,126
Please don't do this.

1184
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:24,570
(gun firing)

1185
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,120
(ominous music)

1186
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:38,400
- You never would've changed.

1187
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,110
Not even for me.

1188
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,090
Once a whore, always a whore.

1189
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,430
Don't touch her.

1190
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,980
I'm the one she loved, not you.

1191
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,400
- All right then.

1192
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,770
What about me, huh?

1193
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,420
- Put these on.

1194
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,050
Do it.

1195
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,706
No, behind you.

1196
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:19,400
(ominous music)

1197
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,636
Just so you don't get any bright ideas.

1198
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,320
(ominous music)

1199
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,767
Evidence.

1200
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:46,460
(ominous music)

1201
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,750
Let's go.

1202
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,627
- Where?

1203
01:22:50,651 --> 01:22:53,046
- Oh, you're gonna escape.

1204
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:56,320
After killing my husband, your partner,

1205
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:02,046
the private investigator
who almost caught you.

1206
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:04,506
- Listen to me, Rachel.

1207
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:07,496
This is never gonna work, okay?

1208
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,346
You're never gonna get away with this.

1209
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,316
- Would you just shut up?

1210
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,826
This has been the worst night of my life

1211
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:14,850
and it's all your fault.

1212
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,726
Keep moving.

1213
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,420
(ominous music)

1214
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:25,500
Keep walking.

1215
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:27,736
That's right.

1216
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,760
Up the hill.

1217
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:32,820
(clock ticking)

1218
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,577
Okay.

1219
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,100
That's far enough.

1220
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,420
- Look don't do this, Rachel.

1221
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,750
Come on.

1222
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,686
All right, look, I'm beggin' ya.

1223
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:01,630
- Will you just shut up
and take it like a man?

1224
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:05,526
- Fuck you.

1225
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:08,220
(ominous music)

1226
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:27,470
(suspenseful music)

1227
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,356
Goddammit.

(phone ringing)

1232
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:36,316
- [Operator] 911, state your emergency.

1233
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,920
(gentle music)

1234
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,050
- There you are.

1235
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,636
You lookin' for me, huh?

1236
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,660
(suspenseful music)

1237
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,026
You fuckin' point a
gun at me, huh, Rachel?

1238
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,966
Take it like a man, huh.

1239
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,570
Take it like a man.

1240
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,480
God.

1241
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,330
