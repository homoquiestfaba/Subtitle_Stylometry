1
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,089
How we looking outside?

2
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,759
We got a shady hotel across
the street and a little bar
on the corner.

3
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,661
- Any apartments?
- None.

4
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:37,131
Looks like we're a go.
Load in tomorrow at sundown.

5
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:41,569
- That's 6:03 p.m.
- Then I'll see everyone at 6:04.

6
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,237
Oh, wait a minute.
I got one more thing.

7
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,640
- What's that?
- Police station's three blocks away.

8
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,377
Remember. No obstacles.

9
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,515
Only challenges.

10
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,552
People just trust some
stranger to pick them up?
Isn't that dangerous?

11
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,720
Which one do you want?

12
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,256
Neither.

13
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,593
Come on! It's your first time.
You gotta get into it
a little bit.

14
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:30,631
- Yeah. I'm not sure that I am going.
- What?

15
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,766
You're going.
I'm telling you right now.

16
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,537
Listen. I have a Tuesday
deadline on three chapters

17
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,706
that I haven't even started yet.

18
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,341
It'd be one thing if you were
working on the
Great American Novel...

19
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,978
- It's called work.
- Right. Work. You're just scared.

20
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,947
Look, Colin, if he doesn't
want to go...

21
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,850
Harmony, could you give us
a second?

22
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,253
- What?
- Come on. Just, please.

23
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,261
- What's going on, Colin?
- You have to go tonight.

24
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,896
It's a surprise for Harmony.

25
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,934
- What kind of surprise?
- A surprise. A big one.

26
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,139
Look. I'm not asking you just
as a roommate or a friend.
I'm asking you as a brother.

27
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,144
- Okay, where is it?
- It's in the city.

28
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,613
And I can leave if
I don't like it?

29
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,652
I don't think that's going
to be a problem.

30
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,055
So, what does this shit
do to you, exactly?

31
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,791
Increases the amount of the
neurotransmitter serotonin

32
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,926
by inhibiting its reuptake
in the brain.

33
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,130
Oh, I'm sorry, Doogie Howser,
what I meant to say was,
"How does it fuck you up?"

34
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:41,702
They fuck you
up. This enhances you.

35
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,171
Heightened awareness of your
senses, especially touch.

36
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,776
Feeling of connection,
openness, honesty.

37
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,211
It's like being a kid.

38
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:55,315
Hmm!
The AMA would be proud, Cliff.

39
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,852
Yeah, well, if you're going to
be a successful drug user you
gotta be well informed.

40
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,162
They're here!

41
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,804
- Ernest. Greetings.
- What's happening, my man?

42
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,540
Killer space.

43
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,976
Yeah. We're going for a
suburban living room meets
opium den kind of thing.

44
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,880
- So, see what you can do.
- Gotcha.

45
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,121
One ten just feels like
a codeine overdose.

46
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,726
Two twenty, on the other hand,
feels like your falling out of
a moving car.

47
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,694
- Hey, Billy Bob!
- What's up?

48
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,229
Maggie says she's burning
down here, man.

49
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,965
The only thing burning
down here is me.

50
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,735
Chaos is about to become order.

51
00:07:54,307 --> 00:08:00,614
Hello? No. You know what, I'm
covered, but thank you.
Okay, cool, bye.

52
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,521
Oh, man! Hello?

53
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,291
Yeah, this is Leyla.

54
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:16,897
No. You know what,
I'm all set. I appreciate it.
Okay.

55
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:20,768
Gold dreads.
I'll look for you. All right.
Bye.

56
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:37,484
- Leyla?
- Hey. I really appreciate you guys coming to pick me up.

57
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,622
No problem. Our dorm is
right down the street.

58
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:45,525
- Great. You guys like Jungle?
- Yeah.

59
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,695
Cool! Thanks.

60
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,740
- What is that?
- A swan.

61
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:05,378
Oh, that's so sweet.
What's it for?

62
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:11,318
Well, 25th anniversary is
silver, and 50th is gold.
First, paper.

63
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,755
I looked it up on the Internet.

64
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,523
Well, it looks like
a pterodactyl.

65
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,928
Do you know what
three years is? Leather.

66
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,736
- A year?
- Okay, 11 months. I rounded up.

67
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,005
But it was a year ago tonight
we met.

68
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,276
- And you remember that.
- I remember because John Digweed was spinning.

69
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,748
And guess what?
He's spinning tonight.

70
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,984
Well, I just hope they don't
play any of that
Happy House crap.

71
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,386
Not on my anniversary.

72
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:01,034
Now, before we do this,
let's take a moment to send
out some positive vibes.

73
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:06,774
Safe party, no busts,
and some fucking electricity.

74
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,347
Fuck me!

75
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,235
Oh!

76
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,016
Let's do it!

77
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,848
What? Forget it!
I'm not parking here.

78
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,151
- Relax!
- It's just a map point.

79
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:28,288
- Oh, the map point.
- Yeah, just hold tight for a sec.

80
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,437
Yeah. Oh, for real?

81
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:49,209
No shit. Damn.

82
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,983
Oh, that's my bad, man. I'll
take it for the team, man.

83
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,153
Two bucks.
Yeah, I'll see you there.
No worries.

84
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,758
- All right? Cool.
- I only have a 20.

85
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,661
- Give me three.
- Yeah, no sweat, man.

86
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:14,734
- All right, brother.
- All right.

87
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:20,440
Hey, kids! Be sure to bust a
left at the second stop light,
not a right.

88
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,675
I fucked up the maps again.

89
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,448
Why don't we just go to the
map point like everybody else?

90
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,686
You want me to tell everyone
I used to babysit you?

91
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,536
Would you just admit you don't
know where the fuck it is?

92
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,703
Shut up.

93
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,715
- Hey! What's up?
- How you doing?

94
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,253
Good to see you!

95
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,093
How you doing?

96
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,565
You guys, this is my brother,
David. Beth. And this is Joe.

97
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,834
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

98
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,064
Got a light?

99
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,102
Thank you.

100
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,908
- Nice braids.
- Thanks.

101
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,844
- I'm Anthony.
- Harmony.

102
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:42,382
I was going to say, I got a
massage room in the back.
Free massages all night.

103
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,384
Cool!

104
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,820
So, if you get tired of
dancing, come back,
I'll fix you up.

105
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,990
Thanks.

106
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,797
I'd like to buy a vowel.

107
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,233
- E or A?
- A.

108
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,970
Two, please.

109
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,042
I'd like to solve the puzzle.

110
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,679
Lysergic acid diethylamide.

111
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,781
Why don't you tell him
what he's won?

112
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,418
An all-expense-paid trip to
your cerebral cortex.

113
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,819
Thanks for playing.

114
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,056
- Hey.
- Where you been? I dropped a while ago.

115
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,292
Had to take a piss.
Where's the bar?

116
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,295
I don't think there's some big
bar in this place.

117
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,163
Hey! I know you!

118
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,501
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, you're that T.A. in Chem 302.

119
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,504
- That's so cool!
- No, I'm not.

120
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,874
Love is the reason. Plur?

121
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,813
Plur. Peace, love,
unity and respect.

122
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,620
Bring on the love.

123
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,215
Excuse me.

124
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,202
- It's free.
- It is?

125
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,537
Mm-hmm.

126
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,810
Hi, are you Leyla?

127
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,546
I read your e-mail.

128
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,150
- Oh. What's your name?
- David.

129
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:02,089
Oh, no, thank you. I'm fine.

130
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,393
Oh.

131
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,796
You can relax.
It's just a party.

132
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,606
Come on, man. It's time.

133
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,783
- Keep your eyes closed.
- I am, I am.

134
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,487
- What are you doing?
- It's a surprise. No peeking.

135
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,437
Oh, my God!

136
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,150
I'll take that as a yes.

137
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,652
David, look!

138
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,896
How's that for spontaneous?

139
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,037
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Have you seen my brother?

140
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,374
- Who?
- Colin.

141
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,645
- He says that he knows everybody.
- Sorry.

142
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,981
- So, you're from New York.
- Just moved.

143
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,285
- Here for work?
- My birthday, I guess.

144
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:52,024
- Happy birthday. Did somebody just turn up the music?
- No.

145
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:55,094
- I'm from back east, too.
- Oh, yeah? Where?

146
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,466
East Lansing.

147
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:04,637
Michigan?
I don't think that counts as
back east.

148
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,009
You know, everyone here knows
what's going to happen to you

149
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,645
so, whatever you need to do,
feel free.

150
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:22,489
You're really nice for a
New Yorker.
What's your name again?

151
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,324
Leyla.

152
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,494
That's right, like that
Kinks song.

153
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,399
Jesus Christ!
Is there a telephone here?

154
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:36,869
- I got a... Tuesday...
- Just take a deep breath and let it out slowly.

155
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,816
I don't think this was
a good idea.

156
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,919
Keep drinking.

157
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,396
You know any of the other DJs
spinning tonight?

158
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,367
There's more than one?

159
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,070
Come on. I think there's
something you should see.

160
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,328
I can't tell what sound his
record is making.

161
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,631
You want to hug?
Sometimes it helps.

162
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,448
Hey, Neil, I've got an idea!
Let's take a disco nap!

163
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,751
Why don't you take it down a
notch. We're only a half hour
late, we're going to be fine.

164
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,920
Yes, but we're late.

165
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,055
- What are you doing?
- I'm driving.

166
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,725
- This is my car, Neil.
- I let you drive my car.

167
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,094
- I bought this two weeks ago!
- What? You don't trust me?

168
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,930
- Trust?
- Look. I know where we're going.

169
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,699
And I don't?
I've lived in this city
for five years with a car.

170
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,669
You drive like an old woman.

171
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,605
I'm sorry.
Would you like to drive?

172
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,847
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,866
Hey!

174
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,905
What's going on, here?

175
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,808
- Just a little party.
- Doesn't sound too little.

176
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,712
- Some friends.
- This building's been vacant for months.

177
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,881
- We just moved in.
- Who?

178
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,551
- Hm?
- Who just moved in?

179
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,353
- The company I work for.
- Yeah? What company?

180
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,490
Software startup.

181
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:48,861
- You on the lease?
- No.

182
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,502
I'm going to need to speak to
somebody who is.

183
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,217
- We got a cop.
- What?

184
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,319
We got a cop!

185
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,788
- What did you tell him?
- That's the funny part.

186
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,557
Make me laugh.

187
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,926
Me and my partner are
celebrating the opening of
our new office space.

188
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,028
My partner and I.

189
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:25,064
He wants to see the owner
of the building.

190
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:33,405
Hey, Colin, remember when
you were 13

191
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:39,011
and Mom busted you for
breaking that ugly-ass lamp
in the living room?

192
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,247
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't even
fucking do it.

193
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:46,553
- Yeah, I know. And I am sorry.
- Oh, it was you?

194
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,022
- I figured she already blamed you...
- Don't worry.

195
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,393
- I didn't get it that bad.
- It sounded pretty bad.

196
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,996
Not as bad as
you would have gotten.

197
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,165
Why, what do you mean?

198
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,468
The good kid always
gets it worse.

199
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,571
Hey! How you feeling?

200
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:08,641
- I think I'm in heaven.
- Oh, you are.

201
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,044
I just saw what's-her-name
from that trip, and I'm going
to go say hi and tell her.

202
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,846
I'll be right back.

203
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:20,252
Hey, Colin.

204
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:25,257
Why didn't you tell me
about the ring, before?

205
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,427
I said it was a surprise.

206
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:31,130
Don't you think it's
a little soon?

207
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,065
It's how I feel.

208
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:37,369
But you've only...
You've known her five months?

209
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:41,808
Let me enjoy this.
I'm asking nice.

210
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,910
It just seems fast.

211
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:49,749
Why is it, every time
something good happens in my
life, you have to judge it?

212
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,355
- Collin, I didn't mean...
- Just be happy for me.

213
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:22,048
You know, if you get past the
Tickle-me-Elmo backpacks
and the big floppy clown pants

214
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,751
some of these girls would be
pretty hot.

215
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,188
What's your pulse? Ballpark.

216
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,796
Todd, I've brought you
this orange.

217
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:40,432
If you don't feel anything in
half an hour, eat it.

218
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:46,105
- Vitamin C has a catalytic effect.
- Super.

219
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,743
No stickers, that's bad!

220
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:15,467
- Want some water?
- Thanks.

221
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,711
- That's so weird!
- What?

222
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,213
That you knew I needed water.

223
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,152
You look familiar.

224
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,557
- Hi. David.
- Hey, David!

225
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,493
- Well, hello. I'm David.
- Anne.

226
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,195
Oh, good!

227
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,833
Hey, the cops are here, man.

228
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,169
I coughed up two bucks a
square foot for this place

229
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,771
and I haven't even chosen
a color palette.

230
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,873
- That's a bitch.
- Yeah.

231
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,642
And you know what they say
about the three most important
things in business.

232
00:27:56,709 --> 00:28:00,246
- Location, location, location.
- Excuse me.

233
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,390
Oh, I'm sorry.

234
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,193
No, go ahead. I'm finished.

235
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,798
What? You can't go in front
of someone else?

236
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:22,869
No, there's a guy...
There's a cop out there.

237
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:29,608
- Yeah? What's he doing?
- He's walking around. He looked right at me.

238
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:34,713
- Oh, God. Do I look high?
- Yeah.

239
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:39,819
- Shit!
- What are you worried about?

240
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,989
I'm doing something illegal.

241
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:50,629
Okay, let's just stay here for
a while and see what happens.

242
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,199
Okay, but remember, I don't
even know you.

243
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:57,970
If he finds anything,
it's your responsibility.

244
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:03,542
- What are you talking about?
- Well, you're carrying, right?

245
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:08,080
- Carrying. You mean drugs?
- Yeah.

246
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,083
You caught me.

247
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:21,360
- Want one?
- No, thanks. I don't... Yeah, please.

248
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,648
- That tastes incredible.
- You took some good shit.

249
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,718
It is an incredibly
enjoyable experience.

250
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,455
First time's always the best.

251
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,825
Thank you for helping
me earlier.

252
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,094
No problem.

253
00:29:55,161 --> 00:30:00,099
- You're very pretty.
- You're very high.

254
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:04,871
If I weren't,
I'd still think you were.
I just wouldn't say it.

255
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:11,310
I'm not trying to hit on you
or anything,
I'm just telling the truth.

256
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,918
I'd watch how much you say
in your state.
You might embarrass yourself.

257
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:27,259
So, this will be the sales
offices. It's going to be
completely gutted

258
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,996
and renovated. We're going
to put in new tile floors.

259
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:37,536
You're probably going to want
to upgrade this
computer system, too, huh?

260
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,406
Yeah.

261
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:43,709
Excuse me,
I have something very
important to ask you all.

262
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,179
Has anybody seen a small
brown teddy bear?

263
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:51,083
- Oh, no!
- There it is!

264
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,220
- Thank you.
- Yay!

265
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,956
Have I showed you reception?

266
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:02,161
Could you do my shoulders?

267
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:08,534
So, you work out?

268
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,270
Yoga. Five days a week.

269
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:16,542
- I can tell. Where at?
- The Body Tree on Fourth.

270
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,446
- Oh.
- What do you mean, "Oh"?

271
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:24,283
Nothing. It's an okay place.

272
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:31,123
You know, you are all in knots.

273
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:37,296
- Really?
- You hold all your stress right here, don't you?

274
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:43,235
Yeah. I mean, no.
I don't have any stress.

275
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:47,373
- Well, something's off.
- What do you mean?

276
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:53,479
- Your kundalini energy. It's all fucked up.
- We're done.

277
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,382
- So that yoga ain't doing you much good.
- Whatever.

278
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,217
Namaste!

279
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:03,855
I imagine this party is the
last fun you'll be having
for a while.

280
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,059
Yeah, but it's an investment
in something I love, though.

281
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:10,196
Well, you're a
true entrepreneur.

282
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,498
I guess I am.

283
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,567
Now, here's my final piece
of advice for you.

284
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,769
Yeah? What's that?

285
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:22,241
Keep the music down and your
ravers inside, or all the love
in the world won't stop me

286
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,743
from busting your ass.

287
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,280
Yes, sir.

288
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:28,074
Hey, thanks, man!

289
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,933
Feels good, doesn't it?

290
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:11,750
- Colin, what's up?
- Nothing.

291
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:15,387
Don't you want to dance?

292
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:19,758
Forest is spinning!
She's our...

293
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:25,297
- Colin, what's going on?
- Nothing.

294
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,103
- You sure?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

295
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:46,518
- Hey, were you at Fantasia?
- Yeah. Two-year anniversary.

296
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,655
We were on the beach.
We smoked a bowl together.

297
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,790
- Ah! What's up, dude?
- How's it going?

298
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,825
- Good to see you man.
- Yeah.

299
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,894
Did you kick it for the
Digweed set that night?

300
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:59,298
He fucking shredded, man.

301
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:02,100
I was stoked to see him
tonight, man, that show
was phat.

302
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:05,604
So, do you know anyone who can
hook up any GHB?

303
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,039
No, man, I'm not doing
any drugs tonight.

304
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,343
I myself am pretty fucked up.

305
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,413
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

306
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,916
Baked, not fried.
The healthy choice.

307
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,797
I'm glad. Really. I mean, who
would want to go to a party
that actually lets you know

308
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,166
where it is!

309
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:10,969
Okay, here we go.

310
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:15,006
It's our anniversary, and
we're going to have
a fucking good time!

311
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,244
- Let's just go home.
- We are not missing it!

312
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:31,590
What's that? More paper?
What is it, a crab?

313
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:41,300
Directions! Directions!

314
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,674
Come on!

315
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,138
spontaneous progress.

316
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:23,909
He loaded a continuous roll of
paper into his typewriter

317
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,714
took benzedrine 20 days
straight. No paragraphs, no
punctuation, nothing

318
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,918
just free-flowing words,
just like notes from a
jazz soloist.

319
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,655
And, two weeks later,
he rolled it up,
brought it to his editor

320
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,424
and the rest is history.

321
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,460
- You're talking about Kerouac.
- Jacques Kerouac.

322
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,395
You know before, when you were
talking about Hemingway...

323
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:44,963
No, I was not
talking about Hemingway.

324
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,198
- Yes, you were!
- No, you've got to keep up.

325
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,269
I was saying that William
Burroughs' economy of prose
is reminiscent of Hemingway.

326
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:53,238
- Hey, you want some glitter?
- No, thank you.

327
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,375
- How about a sticker?
- Okay.

328
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:02,314
- So, you write?
- Yeah, for a living.

329
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:06,251
- Published?
- Three books and a bunch of articles.

330
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,420
- Really?
- Really.

331
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:12,391
- Give me a title.
- I don't think they're the kind of books you'd know.

332
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:16,795
- Hey, I read.
- They're not, like, best sellers or anything.

333
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:23,569
- Come on!
- Well, there's the CD-ROM Toolkit Reference Guide

334
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,738
which is very big
in high schools

335
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:34,179
and, maybe, there's the piece
on configuring your PPP that
was in Macworld last month.

336
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,949
Hey, Ernest Hemingway did
write that whole series of
car repair manuals

337
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:41,219
before he hit it big,
so I think you'll be okay.

338
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:48,326
This is the Celtic love knot,
and this one is for eternity.

339
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:53,298
- Colin, you're so sweet!
- I don't believe it.

340
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:58,404
- Have you guys set a date yet?
- Maybe next year's summer solstice.

341
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,909
- Or, like, with a small ceremony in the woods.
- Are we all invited?

342
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:07,479
Of course, your all invited.
This whole place is invited.

343
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:10,315
I'm getting Forest to spin.

344
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:15,353
- Do I feel tight?
- No! You feel fine!

345
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:19,391
I know, I told that to that
fucking asshole Anthony,
my chakras are all good.

346
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:24,863
- Are you laughing at me?
- Naw.

347
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,935
What are you doing of such
importance to the economy?

348
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,038
- I'm making money.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

349
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,107
Retail slut. Just until
I go back to school.

350
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:39,277
- What? Grad school?
- No, not exactly.

351
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:45,016
- But you're going back.
- Okay. I'm not exactly going back. I'm going.

352
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,587
- I don't get it.
- Undergrad.

353
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:53,559
Oh. So, what school?

354
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:58,430
Um, you know, UC Berkley,
if I get in.
You know, you should really be

355
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:02,133
downing some water because
you'll get dehydrated and...

356
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,704
- I'm really sorry if I...
- No, it's just...

357
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:09,140
Look. Not everyone has to
follow this exact path

358
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,976
that everyone else follows,
you know? It's like

359
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:16,482
I don't really think I have
to live this cookie-cutter
existence, you know?

360
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:20,752
- So, what are you thinking of studying?
- Pre-law.

361
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:24,322
- You don't strike me as a lawyer.
- Thank you.

362
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:29,227
- I mean that in the best possible way.
- Hm. Drink.

363
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:51,550
Excuse me. Everybody?
I'd like to invite you all
over for breakfast.

364
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:58,423
The address is
3899 Guerrero Street,
Number 2.

365
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,960
Thank you all for being here.
Really.

366
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,643
Has anyone seen Colin?

367
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,588
Where the fuck are we?

368
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:41,492
I turned left on Third,
right on Illinois, went down
two blocks...

369
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:47,999
- It says here, "1800 North Illinois."
- Yeah.

370
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,903
- Where are we?
- 1800 South Illinois.

371
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:03,749
I'm driving.

372
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,032
Wow.

373
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,770
What do you see?

374
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:32,243
I see crystal cities.

375
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:47,726
- What was that?
- Just a kiss.

376
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,563
No.

377
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,500
Nonono. Aisle 4.
You're at Safeway, right?

378
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,536
Yeah, the plastic gallons
with the handles.

379
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:03,408
We got more coming.

380
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,879
Five out of five dentists
recommend it.

381
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,552
Okay, you guys got two options:

382
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,789
get rid of the nitrous
or get rid or yourselves.

383
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:23,028
Okay, outside!

384
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:28,126
Okay. Listen to me carefully.
When we were getting ready
this morning

385
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:31,096
- where did you put the crate?
- In the car, like you told me.

386
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:34,365
- Where in the car?
- In the front seat.

387
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,001
- Where?
- In the front seat!

388
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:39,838
- And do you remember what's wrong with the front seat?
- No, not really.

389
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,339
Hey, Monte, you're on in 15.

390
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:45,410
The sun, the fucking sun!
It's vinyl, babe! It melts!

391
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,547
Well, it's your own fault.
I mean, who the fuck buys
vinyl anymore anyway?

392
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:52,583
- Step off!
- I told you you should have bought CDs!

393
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,586
Hey, Big Ernie, man,
I'm Audi 5000.

394
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:59,357
- Have you seen Digweed?
- No, Why?

395
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,928
We need to fill Monte's
time slot. Yeah, go ahead.

396
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,597
Don't say it. Shit!

397
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:10,168
Um, Polywog's in
the chill room.
Go find her, quick.

398
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,613
Hey!

399
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,385
What are you doing?

400
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,961
Todd. Todd!
Did you eat the orange?

401
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,029
Cliff, shut the fuck up and
give me the keys, man.

402
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:39,697
I don't understand.
You should feel happy.

403
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:41,332
I am.
I'm fucking happy I'm leaving.

404
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,301
You're telling me you don't
feel anything?

405
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:46,471
Dude, when did you get all
Haight-Ashbury on me, man?

406
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,874
I mean, you used to listen to
Nitzer Ebb.

407
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,942
I was 12, and I was a Nazi.

408
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:55,780
Cliff, it's a fucking pink
boa. Look at yourself!
I mean, Jesus Christ!

409
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,616
If you were honest with
yourself, you'd see you're an
unhappy person

410
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:01,552
who's been mean to others
in order to make himself
feel better.

411
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,322
Well, thank you, Carl Jung.
Now, if you'll give me
the keys

412
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:08,159
I'm going to go get pissed
drunk and pass out in
the gutter.

413
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:10,295
Like a normal person.

414
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:37,055
What's up, ladies?

415
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:40,391
Hey, we have some major issues
with the lineup.

416
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,528
And Ernie was wondering if you
had another set in you.

417
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,396
Cool. So that's...

418
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:55,673
The sweet cotton-candy kiss of
transcendental bliss.

419
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,944
Okay.
So, I'll take that as a no.

420
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:02,981
How did they get down here?
I thought these doors
were locked.

421
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,050
I don't know, man. I'm sorry.

422
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,455
Jesus, Joe.

423
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,624
What did he take?

424
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,660
Somebody gave this kid GB.

425
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:19,764
Great. Get back.

426
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,167
Come on, man.

427
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:45,256
It's pumpin', man, good luck.

428
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,982
- Okay.
- Here. Get him to drink this.

429
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:21,386
He's got to get something down.

430
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:24,522
I don't understand this guy.
Same story every party.

431
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:27,058
It's all right. I got it.
Okay?

432
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:30,961
Just watch him. Make sure he
doesn't fall asleep.

433
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:35,166
- Stay awake, shithead.
- Fuck you, Man!

434
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,669
Come on.

435
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:46,177
What are you? New? Eat dinner
before you take drugs.

436
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,486
What are you thinking about?

437
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,656
The last four years of my life.

438
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:04,895
- Trying to figure out where it went.
- The time. No shit.

439
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:10,034
- No. There's something else.
- What?

440
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:14,739
I don't really know what to
call it.
I remember when I was younger

441
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:19,777
I used to notice it in the way
I'd move my arms sometimes

442
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:25,516
or the way somebody bumps into
you in the store and says,
"Excuse me."

443
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:29,554
I could be folding my laundry
or reading in bed

444
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:35,025
and it would just occur to me
that I'm alive.

445
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,030
I haven't felt that way in
a long time.

446
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:45,470
But I feel like that right now.

447
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:21,806
Hey! Harmony, right?

448
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,643
You two know each other?

449
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:30,047
Colin, this is Harmony.

450
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,818
Hi.

451
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,391
I don't understand you two
just sitting here when
you could be

452
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,661
outside on the
dance floor dancing.
You're missing it all!

453
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:41,218
Zoe Jameson, one of my
best friends at the time

454
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:46,424
we traveled all over Madrid
and Ibiza and Amsterdam...

455
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:52,697
My brother, he tried to get me
to do the Eurorail thing.

456
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:57,768
It's so funny, because
I remember telling him
I didn't feel like going.

457
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,705
I can't believe that.
You would have loved Spain.

458
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,808
Oh, did you go to San Sebastian?

459
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:10,681
No, but I went to Club
Rohypnol and Club Insomnia

460
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:17,455
and Daydream. We got on the
ten clubs in eight days bus.

461
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:25,195
I told myself that I was
seeing the world, but I didn't
see the light of day.

462
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:29,567
How long did you two last?

463
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:35,473
I don't know. We kind of
just stayed there and came
back when our money ran out.

464
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,445
You know, did some shit jobs
and just worked to party.

465
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,681
And then what?

466
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:50,488
Zoe sort of...
I guess she went off to school

467
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:54,091
in Buffalo, I think.

468
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:58,529
I just kind of did my thing,
you know.

469
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:01,231
No one every OD'd, I never
had a friend die on me, and

470
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:07,572
I always felt like I was just
on the brink of something.

471
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:11,409
Did you ever see Zoe again?

472
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:22,152
I was coming back one morning

473
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,256
I have my ass

474
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,527
on the 1-9 train

475
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,030
and I saw her.

476
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:38,436
And, I don't know why
I remember this, but

477
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:42,306
she was wearing this watch,
this amazing gold watch that
I'd never seen before

478
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:44,409
and her hair looked different.

479
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:48,345
I said to her, "Hey!

480
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:51,048
"Sister, how's school going?"

481
00:55:56,821 --> 00:56:00,858
And she looked at me for a
long time.

482
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:03,894
A long time.

483
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:08,733
And she said,
"I graduated two years ago."

484
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:17,374
And I promised myself after
that that I'd change,
you know?

485
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:23,714
But what am I doing now?
I mean, I moved here
and I ain't done shit.

486
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:25,483
Why not?

487
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,487
It just doesn't happen.

488
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,660
What are you waiting for?

489
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,828
What do you mean?

490
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,731
Well, what do you want to do?

491
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,201
I don't know.

492
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,907
Do you know?

493
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:54,679
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I don't know.

494
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,382
Yeah, I do know what I want to
do, but I'm not doing it.

495
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,452
The same as you.

496
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,255
So, come on.

497
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,031
I don't know.

498
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,601
This is safe.

499
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,843
I just want to commit
to something without any fear.

500
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:31,281
Yeah, I think that's what
we'd both like.

501
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:34,852
But it doesn't work like that.

502
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,127
I know.

503
00:57:56,841 --> 00:58:00,911
This is good. It's weird,

504
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,148
'cause it's good.

505
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,995
I'm going to get you some water.

506
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:22,399
- Please stay.
- No.

507
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:28,539
I'll be right back.

508
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:50,094
Ernest! He's got to get
out of here right
now, man.

509
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,202
- They're coming from Oracle.
- What?

510
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,772
Roland's party, man.
It got busted and he gave out
this address.

511
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,409
- How big was it?
- About a thousand.

512
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,413
Joe.

513
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,718
Hey.

514
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,722
Joe?

515
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,859
Come on. Come on!

516
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,930
Hey, come on. Wake up!

517
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:29,834
- Asshole!
- What do you care?

518
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,869
You'd be dead if I didn't.

519
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,403
You don't fucking care.

520
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,806
Whatever.
You're fucked up.

521
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:45,482
What's up, kids?
We've reached capacity.

522
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,551
You can't come in.

523
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:49,820
Hey, isn't this Ernie's party?

524
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:54,091
No, this isn't his party.

525
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:56,260
There's tramps in there.
You wouldn't like it.

526
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,229
But you said I could get in.
He knows me, man.

527
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,901
Tell him there's an outdoor
next week Sunday.

528
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:06,036
Have him check the voice mail.

529
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,974
There's a free beach party,
an outdoor, on Sunday.

530
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,375
If you check with the
voice mail...

531
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:16,714
What do I do now?

532
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:19,684
Run.

533
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,200
Let's hit the road.

534
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:39,136
Officer, can't I just get my
records, here?
I'll just put them away.

535
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:40,938
We got to clear you out.
Come on, bud.

536
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,273
- Officer, I just need to get my records.
- Come on.

537
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,479
Let's go, son, move along!

538
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:03,460
- Shut her down right now.
- Okay, okay. Give us five. Relax.

539
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:10,034
Let's go. Get some air.
Keep on spreading the love,
right out the door.

540
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,503
Let's go!

541
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:24,882
Come on, you're going to be
late for school.

542
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:41,631
You need to come down.
Come on.

543
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:46,536
Let's go. Everyone out!
Right now!
This party is over!

544
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,317
Hey, Colin.

545
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:03,954
Maybe I'll see you out again
some time. Can you give me
your number, or...

546
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,924
Look, I normally don't do
that sort of thing.

547
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:09,026
Why? You don't have a phone?

548
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,295
You know exactly what I'm
talking about.

549
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:16,566
Oh. You mean our little
meeting of the minds?

550
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:23,207
- Look, I'm not... You know...
- What?

551
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,078
Neither am I.

552
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,629
Well, is there anything else
going on tonight?

553
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:48,966
Tonight. Neil, it's 4:00 a.m.

554
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,071
Fuck it. Let's go home.

555
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,820
I have an idea.

556
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,862
- David!
- Hey!

557
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:54,464
- I thought you left.
- No.

558
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:58,702
- You haven't seen Harmony, have you?
- No, I haven't.

559
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,971
- Just give me a hug, okay?
- Okay.

560
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:04,374
Hey, did you see Leyla leave?

561
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,016
Colin?

562
01:04:13,717 --> 01:04:17,721
- Remember in gym, those little bags?
- What bags?

563
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:22,526
You know, those little kits
that had the razors and the
shaving cream in them?

564
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,628
Oh, right, right!
And deodorant.

565
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:37,607
You okay, Colin?

566
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:41,678
Me and Harmony kind of got
into a little fight.

567
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:44,481
But everything's going
to be okay.

568
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,819
I'm just really glad that
you're here.

569
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:55,659
I am, too, Colin. I am, too.

570
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,895
I'll go find her.

571
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:10,874
- Your ring is so beautiful!
- Thanks.

572
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:16,213
- You're so lucky.
- You know what they say about Geminis and Scorpios:

573
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,348
they're meant to be.

574
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:30,060
Why do you do this to yourself?

575
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:34,031
You don't even get paid,
you risk getting arrested.
For what?

576
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,237
- You don't know?
- No.

577
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:44,008
The nod.

578
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,477
- The nod?
- Yeah.

579
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,446
It happens to me at least once
every party.

580
01:05:49,513 --> 01:05:53,150
Somebody comes up to me and
says, "Thank you for making
this happen."

581
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:57,521
"I needed this." "This really
meant something to me."

582
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,189
And they nod.

583
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,858
And I nod back.

584
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:08,198
- That's it?
- That's it.

585
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,640
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
Is this party still happening,
or what?

586
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,877
Voice mail.
Change the message.

587
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:22,912
"Digweed just walked in with
a fresh crate of vinyl."

588
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,881
They'll be e-mailing about
this one for years.

589
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:27,417
I hate to interfere with your
reality, right now,
but we were busted.

590
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,453
You gonna let a little thing
like that stop us?

591
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,122
I wouldn't call getting the
power locked out and getting
our decks checked by the cops

592
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,823
a little thing.
I mean, everybody's gone.

593
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,925
- How about showing a little faith?
- How about opening your eyes?

594
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,727
It's over.

595
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:40,397
Guy, if there's one thing you
learn tonight I hope
it's this:

596
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,999
the shit ain't over till
the last record spins.

597
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:00,750
Watch your step.
Straight ahead.

598
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:02,852
Come on. It's on, it's on.

599
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,914
You have control of the bridge.

600
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,597
Look, Harmony,
there's something...

601
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:34,103
Vitamin E as an antioxidant,
some tryptophan to
stabilize serotonin

602
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,873
and some ephedrine to
pick me up.

603
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,845
- You want to hit the EndUp?
- Sure.

604
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:44,781
Thanks.

605
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:47,717
Glad you enjoyed it.

606
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,385
Thank you.

607
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,962
- Can I touch you?
- What?

608
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:02,766
I just want to say that I
touched the DJ that changed
my life.

609
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:06,069
I'm serious! I wouldn't be
spinning this crazy shift
if it wasn't for you.

610
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:10,406
That's why I'm here. That last
song you played was sick!
Tore the roof off!

611
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:12,909
I mean, you just can't find
records like that in Fresno.

612
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:15,111
I gotta mix... What's this?

613
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:19,248
That's the new Bedrock single.
It's the last track
I played tonight.

614
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:21,885
- No shit!
- Yeah, I heard you played a rocking set tonight.

615
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:25,288
Everyone said it was great.
Keep up the good work.

616
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:30,694
- Hey. Right on.
- Thank you.

617
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,630
- Nice meeting you.
- See you, yeah.

618
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:37,166
Hey, you know,
if you're ever in Fresno,
I do a weekly there.

619
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:40,503
- Friday night. It's rocking.
- Maybe I'll see you down there.

620
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,572
Yeah.

621
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,511
Hey, Ernie.

622
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:54,684
- Yeah?
- I'm glad I found you.

623
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:58,254
I don't know, I just wanted to
say, you know,

624
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:01,758
thanks.

625
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,763
No problem.

626
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:39,655
- So.
- So.

627
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:47,163
I'd like to call you,
if that's okay.

628
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:55,471
Got a pen?
