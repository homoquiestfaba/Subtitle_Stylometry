1
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,669
Director: All right, let's
clear here.

2
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:40,340
Here we go.
Five, four, three, two...

3
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:42,309
Man: It's "America this
morning."

4
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:45,646
I'm Jay, this is my girl, candy.
And, of course, everybody knows

5
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,348
I'm an animal lover.
>> Yes, we know that, Jay.

6
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:51,485
That's because you're an animal.
>> Well, you're exactly right.

7
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,937
But, actually, I heard about
this town in Florida where

8
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,406
they're having a dog marathon.
>> You're kidding.

9
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,443
No, I'm not kidding.
>> All right, so that's 26.2

10
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:02,996
Miles of loud, dog barking and
dog fighting, and who exactly is

11
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:06,200
gonna clean up the poop
after this is all said and done?

12
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:07,584
Certainly not me. [ Laughs ]

13
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,203
But, listen, it's for charity,
though.

14
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:11,038
It's a good thing.
>> Oh, really?

15
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:13,757
What charity would that be,
the dumb ideas foundation?

16
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,594
Folks, my girl candy,
I mean, she's a cat-lover.

17
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:20,214
She's a hater, okay?
>> Oh, I'm a hater, am I?

18
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:22,099
Yes, you are.
>> All right, well, viewers,

19
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,384
we'd love to hear what you
think about this brilliant idea.

20
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,888
So, please, e-mail us, tweet us,
and we will weigh in this

21
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:31,308
subject at the end of the show.
Coming up next, we have a

22
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,895
brilliant wholistic doctor who
says that he has proof that a

23
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,315
rare mushroom can cure cancer.
We'll be right back.

24
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:42,619
Director: And we're clear.
>> Can someone please explain to

25
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,706
me why this is freezing?! Jay?

26
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,125
Yes?
>> After eight years of working

27
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,628
together, why would you refer to
me as a cat-person, when you

28
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,047
know I can't stand animals of
any kind?

29
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:58,719
It was for the segment, okay?
You gonna be okay?

30
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:02,506
Well, I just think it's a big
deal to falsely represent

31
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,840
someone. >> Here we go.

32
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,976
You know what?
In the future, would you please

33
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,478
just refrain from referring to
me as a dog-person or

34
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,564
a cat-person...
or even a goldfish-person,

35
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:13,100
because that's not who I am.
>> All right, whatever.

36
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,818
Are you gonna
get over it, though?

37
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,687
Yes, I'm fine.
Where's my coffee?!

38
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,605
Can somebody get her some
coffee, please?

39
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,107
Thank you. >> That's right there

40
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,742
oh, boy.
>> Director: All right, folks,

41
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:24,828
here we go.
We're back in five, four, three,

42
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,364
two...
>> It doesn't make any sense.

43
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,783
Welcome back to
"America this morning."

44
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,919
Our next guest...
>> We've confirmed for Thursday,

45
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,503
candy.
Now, Friday is the governor's

46
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,672
ball... we've not rsvped for
that, so are we a "go,"

47
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,541
what are we doing?
>> Okay, wait a minute,

48
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,792
it's this Friday? >> Yes.

49
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,677
We need to cancel.
I have other plans.

50
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,546
You want to cancel
the governor's ball.

51
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,848
Yes, we need to cancel.
Tell him I came down with

52
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,435
something.
>> Even though you were just

53
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,884
on the air looking perfectly
healthy?

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,386
Tell him it happened
after the show.

55
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,104
Got it. >> Also, one more thing.

56
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,709
Yes?
>> Yesterday, I saw some crumbs

57
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,477
on my desk.
I don't know if they were muffin

58
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,810
crumbs or something like that,
but are you trying to ruin my

59
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,528
career?
>> Candy, I didn't mean to bring

60
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,781
pastries around.
>> We have talked about this

61
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,783
several times.
I'm on a very strict diet for

62
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,151
the next 90 days.
>> I know that.

63
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,403
Which means that I can't be
around any sweets of any kind

64
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,989
because even the smell of sweets
is total mayhem for me.

65
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:11,575
And I don't want to be in
chat rooms and on social media

66
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,378
where people are talking about
how I've just become this big

67
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,130
fat cow, and they put a picture
of me in the tabloids next to

68
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:20,217
shamu!
>> Candy, it won't happen again.

69
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,719
That's a relief. Bounce.

70
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,471
Bye, thank you.

71
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,843
Muffin crumbs? Really?

72
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:34,064
Don't you think you're
overreacting just a bit, candy?

73
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,984
Louis, as a manager,
you of all people know how

74
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:39,936
vicious, sometimes, fans can be.
>> But that's your eighth

75
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,356
assistant this year.
>> Well, what is your point

76
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,908
about that?
>> I guess I have no point.

77
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,278
These just came in from that
f.A.N. Guy again.

78
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,664
That's the third time this
month.

79
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:54,084
[ Sighs ]
"Anyone can sing in the sun,

80
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,254
but not many people know how to
dance in the rain."

81
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,206
That's corny.
>> Aw, that's very sweet.

82
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,091
This guy always says the coolest
things.

83
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,843
Well, he just might be a
stalker.

84
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:05,095
Oh, relax.
I'm sure it's harmless.

85
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,431
I'm gonna put this with my
collection.

86
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, candy, the reporter from
<i>woman now</i> magazine is on set

87
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,936
ready for her interview.
>> Louis, really?

88
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,689
How many of these things
do I have to do in a week?

89
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:18,308
The book's not gonna sell
itself, candy.

90
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,143
Just give 'em 15 minutes,
at least.

91
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:23,730
Roger that. Gina, get out.

92
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:26,700
Ugh!
I need to get my head straight

93
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:29,119
before this interview. [ Sighs ]

94
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,656
You need to get a lot more
than that straight, candy.

95
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:41,048
You've won numerous awards
and honors for hosting one of.

96
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,751
America's favorite talk shows.
You have endorsement deals,

97
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:47,504
thousands of fans, and now a new
book.

98
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,006
Is there anything that
candy meyers can't do?

99
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:52,259
Um... You know, it's funny, I...

100
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,761
I don't think of myself as very
special.

101
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:58,682
I just... I'm blessed enough to
have the lord give me these

102
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,402
beautiful assignments, and I'm
crazy enough to say yes.

103
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:07,223
But one might wager, candy,
with your busy life and being a

104
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:11,244
woman of a certain age...
That maybe you've chosen to

105
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:15,115
sacrifice certain things,
like marriage and a family.

106
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,118
You know, I think it's
interesting, Nadia, that you

107
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,837
would equate a marriage and
family as happiness.

108
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,924
And I'm sure that there are
millions of women around the

109
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,843
world who would beg to differ.
Unfortunately, I don't have the

110
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,391
time to argue this point because
I have to re-shoot this promo.

111
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,264
But know I didn't mean to
offend you.

112
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,134
Oh, no, I know.
Thank you so much for your time.

113
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,553
Really, take care.
Good seeing you.

114
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,522
Thank you.

115
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,731
You want to tell me what's
wrong?

116
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,901
You haven't said a word since
the interview earlier.

117
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,541
I ever tell you I'm adopted?
>> No.

118
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:01,244
No, I would have remembered
something like that.

119
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,213
[ Sighs ]

120
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:10,971
I was eight years old
when my parents... the meyers...

121
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,057
told me.
Do you know what it was like to

122
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,761
be eight years old and find out
that your family doesn't really

123
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:21,731
belong to you?
>> I can't imagine that, no.

124
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:26,269
Well, I suddenly felt like,
I don't know, a hamster that you

125
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,524
bring home from the pet store.
You know, you're part of the

126
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,194
family, but you're not really
part of the family.

127
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:38,281
They love you, candy.
I mean, you and I both know

128
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,534
that.
>> Yes, I know that, Louis,

129
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:42,702
but that doesn't change how I
feel.

130
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:46,289
You know, and when that reporter
today stated so graciously that

131
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,042
I didn't have a family of my
own, I just started thinking,

132
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,962
you know, if I do end up having
children of my own, what am I

133
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,930
gonna tell them?
I don't know anything.

134
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,633
I don't know about their
grandparents, I don't know about

135
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,469
their ancestry, their history,
my medical background.

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,222
I know nothing.
>> Your grandparents are your

137
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:05,275
folks, Evelyn and errol meyers.
>> Yeah, Louis.

138
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:09,529
And when my imaginary kids turn
eight years old, I'll just tell

139
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,949
them that that was a lie, too.
Never mind.

140
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,118
I'll be back.

141
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,826
Louis: Three red onions, as
requested.

142
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,411
Candy: Oh, great! Perfect.

143
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:27,497
You need me to chop 'em up?
>> No, but can you shred that

144
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,332
gouda for me, please?
>> Why not?

145
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,718
You want me to milk the cow,
too, while I'm at it?

146
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:33,970
Let me wash my hands.

147
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:37,057
I figured you'd be done with
this already.

148
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,843
Yeah, well, my family shows
up for the first time ever

149
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,728
on time, and I'm nowhere near
done.

150
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:43,513
Yeah, I see.

151
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,567
Wow! What a treat!

152
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:50,687
Louis, it's so good to see you.
>> Hi, Gladys.

153
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,022
How are you? >> Excellent.

154
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,658
And yourself?
>> Blessed as ever.

155
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,494
Came to see if my eldest needed
any help?

156
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,946
No, thank you, mom. I've got it.

157
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,531
Mm-hmm. I see.

158
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,200
I guess you do... with Louis
here.

159
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,453
Isn't this your day off?
Don't you need a break from my

160
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,588
daughter's running you around
you around everywhere?

161
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:11,374
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Correction, he's the one who's

162
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,344
always running me around...
book tours and interviews and

163
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,429
assignments.
>> I'm just dropping by to make

164
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:18,298
sure everything's okay. >> Mmm.

165
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,934
Checking in, huh? Off the clock?

166
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,686
Mom. >> For no money.

167
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,854
Mom!
>> Are you sweet on my candy,

168
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,939
Louis? >> Mom!

169
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,108
Stop! You're always reading into

170
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,393
stuff!
Louis and I have a perfectly

171
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,863
wonderful working relationship.
He is my business manager,

172
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,700
that is it.
>> Well, something's going on.

173
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,869
I mean, Robbie never checked in
on his day off.

174
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,073
That's because Robbie was an
idiot, which is why I fired him.

175
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,625
Don't say that. He's family.

176
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,877
Not my family. >> Come again?

177
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,330
Nothing.
>> Louis, since you're here,

178
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:52,882
why don't you stay for lunch and
join us?

179
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,884
Sure. >> No, no, no, mom!

180
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,671
I have something really
important I need to discuss.

181
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,890
It's a family issue.
>> That's okay, Mrs. meyers.

182
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,010
I got a few errands to run
anyway.

183
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:06,730
You need anything else?
>> No, this was awesome.

184
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,732
Thank you. Appreciate it.

185
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,101
All right. Good to see you.

186
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:12,592
You have a good day.
>> Take care.

187
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:14,437
Okay.

188
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:20,910
What? >> I think you hurt his

189
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,529
feelings. >> Oh, please!

190
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,365
Mom, he gets paid enough to get
over it.

191
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,003
Candace Ann meyers!
You're so bourgeois.

192
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,090
I wonder where I got it from.

193
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,211
[ Laughs ] Oh, my God!

194
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:41,965
All: Amen. >> Praise Jesus.

195
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,683
Pass the butter, please. >> Oh.

196
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,769
Here you are, daddy.
>> Thanks, candy girl.

197
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,938
More sweet tea, please.
>> Okay, coming right up.

198
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,057
Uh-uh. That's enough for her.

199
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,727
All right, well, does anybody
want anything while I'm up?

200
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,229
You want some hot sauce or I
have peppers in the fridge.

201
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:58,815
Or, John, you want anything?
>> No, I'm fantastic.

202
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,700
Why are you waitressing, candy?

203
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,619
Yeah, stop worrying about us
and just eat.

204
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,537
I just want to make sure
everybody's okay.

205
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:05,822
We're okay. Sit.

206
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:10,460
And where is all of this
nervous energy coming from, huh?

207
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,414
Wait. Are you seeing someone?

208
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,884
What's his name?
>> I'm not seeing anyone,

209
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:19,335
Charmaine. >> Oh.

210
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:21,304
Then when are you gonna start?
>> I don't know!

211
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,475
Do not snap at your sister,
she's just concerned about you,

212
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,594
as are we all. >> I am fine.

213
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:31,314
And when I start seeing the
right someone, you all will be

214
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,401
the first five people to know.
>> I think Louis is perfect

215
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,352
for you, honey.
I wish you would listen to me.

216
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:39,439
Mommy, I said the same thing!
>> He has love and adoring...

217
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:42,409
can we please... can we
please stop talking about my

218
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,576
love life? I have...

219
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:47,113
and he has a job!
>> I have something...

220
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:51,167
I have something that I want to
talk to you guys about anyway.

221
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,753
Hmm? >> What's on your mind,

222
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:56,039
baby girl? >> I...

223
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,177
I think it's time that I find...
Them.

224
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,799
Who's she looking for?

225
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:17,994
Mom...
I didn't mean to make you upset.

226
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,747
I'm not upset, Candace.
>> Clearly.

227
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,632
You have everything going for
you.

228
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:28,170
A great life, a fabulous career.
Money, fame.

229
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,173
Why now? >> I don't know.

230
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:34,560
I just feel like it's time.
>> At 35 years old?

231
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,063
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize there was a

232
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,515
statute of limitations
for me to find my real...

233
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:43,436
we are your real family...
from day one!

234
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,906
Yeah, and then a miracle
happened.

235
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,026
We never treated you
differently when Charmaine was

236
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,245
born, and you know that.
>> I do know that, mom,

237
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,882
but I am different.
And I just... you know, I want

238
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,220
to know who I belong to.
>> You belong to me.

239
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,024
To us.

240
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,597
Mom, I'm sorry.
Please don't cry.

241
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,350
So we don't have the same
blood line.

242
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,686
Who cares?
You're still my big sister.

243
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,640
I will be, char, thank you.
>> And it's obvious to me

244
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:24,860
whoever your real parents are,
they don't care about you.

245
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,897
Charmaine! >> Mom, I'm sorry.

246
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,733
Look, they had enough time to
find her.

247
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,786
I mean, duh!
All they had to do was turn on

248
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,739
the TV, and there she was
in plain sight.

249
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,209
It's obvious they chose
to stay away.

250
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:45,498
You don't get it.
They could never love you

251
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,718
the way we do. >> Candace?

252
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,671
Coming, daddy.

253
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:09,855
Clearly, you gave this a lot
of thought before you told us.

254
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:13,609
Yes, sir. >> Yeah, well...

255
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,663
You're a grown woman.
Who am I to stop you?

256
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:23,836
Daddy...
None of this changes how I feel

257
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,421
about you and mom.

258
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,043
Uh-huh. I sure hope so.

259
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,966
Because I couldn't bear
to lose you.

260
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,385
You won't.

261
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:46,692
Well... We'll do anything we can

262
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,978
for you, candy yam.

263
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,734
Thank you, dad. You're the best.

264
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,453
[ Chuckles ] You, too.

265
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,573
Gina: Candy, did you get my
text that the signing was

266
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,625
scheduled to start
30 minutes ago?

267
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,960
I did. I ignored it.

268
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:09,498
Okay, not a problem.
Well, there's a huge crowd out

269
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,468
there, which is good, even if
you're late.

270
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,587
Do you need anything before you
start?

271
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:17,723
Yes, privacy... immediately.

272
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,309
Thank you. >> Got it.

273
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,347
Any calls?
>> No calls from the agency.

274
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,983
[ Sighs ]
I don't understand, Louis.

275
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,270
I mean, okay, there's no father
listed on my birth certificate,

276
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:33,572
but they found my mother three
weeks ago.

277
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,610
So why hasn't she contacted me?
>> Well, maybe she's scared,

278
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,578
candy. It's been over 30 years.

279
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,947
Well, I'm not waiting another
30 years.

280
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:45,201
I hired a private investigator.
Hopefully, he'll speed up the

281
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,453
results.
>> And I'm just now hearing

282
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,788
about this?
>> I'm sorry, I didn't realize

283
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,790
I needed to clear it with you,
Louis.

284
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:54,677
Well, as your manager, no,
but as your friend, I'd like to

285
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,296
be kept in the loop.
>> Hey, candy, they're really,

286
00:14:57,347 --> 00:15:00,266
really asking very nicely that
we start the book signing

287
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,469
right now. >> Fine.

288
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,387
On with the show, right?

289
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,944
Here you are. >> Thank you!

290
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,696
You're welcome.

291
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,533
Evening, miss meyers.
>> Good evening.

292
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,573
Are you um, f.A.N.? >> No, no.

293
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,825
My brother Freddie is... was.

294
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:30,796
He had a heart attack and passed
away a couple days ago.

295
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:35,134
Oh, no, I'm...
I'm sorry to hear that.

296
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,503
His...
His cards and his flowers,

297
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:40,723
they always made my day.
>> Yeah, well, he would have...

298
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:46,729
He would have like that.
>> Please, give your family my

299
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,766
condolences. >> Well, you see...

300
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,771
That's just the thing.
You are my family.

301
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:59,491
Uh, just ask the...
Detective you sent.

302
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,027
What? >> Who are you?

303
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:04,780
I'm abner Thomas Nelson.
My brother was

304
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,167
Frederick Andrew Nelson. And...

305
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:12,788
He was your father, candy.
>> No, I'm...

306
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,090
I'm sorry, that...
That can't be.

307
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,794
Well, I'm sorry it had to
come to you like this.

308
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,464
Freddie was so looking forward
to meeting you.

309
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,099
Excuse me.

310
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:29,054
Um... [ Clears throat ]

311
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:32,858
Freddie's funeral is in a couple
of days out in Manning.

312
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:37,446
My number's there.
He would surely love it if...

313
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,982
If she could attend.

314
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,408
So you're not even gonna
consider it?

315
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,294
He's your biological father,
candy.

316
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,465
This is your last chance
to see him above ground.

317
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,169
All right.
You'll regret it if you don't.

318
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,839
I can't go.

319
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:11,980
Not by myself.
>> Who says you have to?

320
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,316
And as a friend, deal?

321
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:19,131
Well... This is it.

322
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,717
You ready?

323
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,844
Man: Yes. Brother Freddie...

324
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:36,014
Was a good man.
>> Woman: Yes, he was.

325
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:39,685
He... Oh, my!

[ Shutter clicks ]
>> Brother Freddie...

329
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,031
Was a very hard-working man,
who served the lord

330
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:57,786
with joy in his heart.
He loved his family.

331
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,623
And didn't have an enemy in the

I was worried about you, Louis.

1185
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:57,655
You didn't return any of my
calls when you were in Manning.

1186

with my birth mother.

No, okay.
No, I didn't forget about you,
