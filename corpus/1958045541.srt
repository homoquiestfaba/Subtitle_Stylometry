1
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:10,333
Take your shoes off
when you get inside.

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,250
And don't forget to call me
before you go to bed, ok?

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,916
Yes Mom.

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,125
Kiss your Mommy bye.

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,833
Be good!

6
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,291
(Tagalog) Yes.

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,833
Be good.

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:30,833
(Tagalog) Yes!

9
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,500
POLLY'S HERE!

10
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,166
Oh my god you came! YAY!

11
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,375
Hi! Hi! Welcome to the party!

12
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,958
Sleepover!

13
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,208
Welcome welcome.

14
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,750
Thanks for um inviting
me over tonight too!

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,250
Yeah of course, you don't
need to be so polite about it.

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,500
We have been wanting to
hang out with you for so long!

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,041
Like so long!

18
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,791
Your house is
really cool, Lizzie.

19
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,083
Yeah we're into
some pretty weird shit.

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,250
Dinosaurs?

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,791
My parents are
into collecting, so...

22
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,583
Are they home?

23
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,000
No! We have the whole
place to ourselves tonight.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,541
Which is perfect because...

25
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:38,458
In honor of the first of
many sleepovers with Polly...

26
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,333
We're getting fucked up tonight!
- Yay!

27
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,750
I forget, do you drink Polly?

28
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,708
Uh-not really. I just wanted
to wait until I turned 21.

29
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,125
Oh.
- Aw, you're so cute!

30
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:58,833
OK, we're all going to have some
but seriously it's no pressure.

31
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,583
No pressure!

32
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,791
How can I say no to you guys?

33
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,333
YES! Ok, Polly Pocket!

34
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,333
That's the kind of energy
we're trying to have tonight!

35
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,333
We have so much fun
planned for you tonight.

36
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,625
Cheers to Polly!

37
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:35,125
(singing)

38
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,708
Try this on!
- Me?

39
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,916
Yeah!
- It's like a mermaid!

40
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,041
Strike a pose! And
pose! And pose!

41
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,541
Polly! Get up get up!

42
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,708
Don't be shy!

43
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,291
Yes! Wait I love it.

44
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,458
You're so pretty!

45
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,041
No stop..

46
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,250
Ravishing!

47
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,583
Look at you!

48
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,541
Round 2!

49
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,333
Ready? 5, 6, 7, yes!

50
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,833
YES!!

51
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,125
One fluid movement, you know?

52
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,208
I think I got this!

53
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,958
That is it right there! Yes!

54
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:18,000
Polly! Polly! Polly!

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,750
(vomits)

56
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,666
Oh shit.

57
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,708
Polly?

58
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh my god oh my god ok.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,250
You're ok, you're ok!

60
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,791
Turn the lights on!

61
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,291
Ew ew!

62
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:50,791
Shit!

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,750
Fuck!

64
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,250
Get out!

65
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,000
Lizzie this is not
funny, turn the lights on!

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,541
It is a clapper, alright?

67
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:58,916
Ow fuck!

68
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,375
Lizzie I knew you
made hers too strong!

69
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,875
Me? You're the one who
gave her a second drink.

70
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,166
I didn't know if she'd
taken enough for IT to work!

71
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,750
This is so fucked!

72
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,750
Lizzie do something!
- I'm trying to think.

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,458
(moaning)

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,291
Oh my god...

75
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,416
I'm so sorry guys!

76
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,750
I don't know what happened...

77
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,375
I just fainted and
all of a sudden I--

78
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,791
Oh my god.. You're
OK, you're OK.

79
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,750
Just let it out... let it out.

80
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,250
What is that?!

81
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,291
Holy shit.
- Oh my god.

82
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,625
She's beautiful!
- This is amazing.

83
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,291
I just knew she was ripe!

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,166
It worked!

85
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,041
What are you guys talking about?

86
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,583
We have to start
getting her ready!

87
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,041
We can't wait a minute longer.

88
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,083
Mother will be so pleased!

89
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,750
What's wrong with me?!

90
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:19,458
Oh! Oh no no Polly, it's ok.

91
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,666
There's nothing wrong with you.

92
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,958
No, you have done so well.

93
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,083
You're just perfect.

94
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,500
What did you put in my drink?

95
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,625
Something beautiful.

96
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,791
I know it's scary but it'll all
make sense soon. We promise.

97
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,166
Trust us.

98
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,375
We're your friends.

99
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,791
Does that look good?

100
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,125
Shit ok.

101
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,041
I'll start putting
feathers on this side.

102
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,041
Feathers!

103
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,958
No, Kelly! Are you
fucking kidding
me? - What?

104
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,291
We don't have time
for this! - But we're
putting feathers on her!

105
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,250
The more feathers the better
that's what I thought. - On her
arms not on her fucking face!

106
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,250
She has feathers on her fucking
face, they're right here!

107
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,291
We literally don't have time
for this! - What are you
talking about, I thought
that was the whole thing?!

108
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,416
No! Stop throwing them
and put them on her!

109
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,230
I put so many on her!!
I thought that was the

110
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:35,856
problem, you guys didn't like it
when I put the feathers on her!!

111
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,666
(distant squawking)

112
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,375
Mother, we bring
you the gift of the pure.

113
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,750
We have seen her innocence.

114
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,750
Yes Mother, we've prepared
her for you. Just how you like.

115
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,791
We have her fruit, Mother.
Please see for yourself.

116
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,625
(large wings flapping)

117
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:42,291
You live in fear, child.

118
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:47,250
But you are among only sisters.

119
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,291
All is love.

120
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,708
You hold back...

121
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:08,333
But you have more
power than you know.

122
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,208
Release your restraints.

123
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,208
Let us be your wings.

124
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,791
Do you wish to fly?

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,208
I do.

126
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,833
I do!

127
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,541
My daughters!

128
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,458
Rejoice for your sister.

129
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,250
I do!

130
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,416
She has chosen to see the light.

131
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,875
I do.

132
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:56,333
She baptizes in the
blood of our sacred sisters.

133
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,583
I do.

134
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
Do you absorb their wisdom?

135
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,375
I do!

136
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,125
Do you bask in their power?!

137
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:10,083
I do. I do! I do!

138
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,875
Great ancestors of old!

139
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,541
Awaken from your
fossilized remains...

140
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:25,416
Grant your flightless
descendants the ferocity which
you once ruled the earth!

141
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,750
Give us your ancient power!

142
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,375
I do!

143
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,250
Give us your light!

144
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,583
Polly! Polly!
