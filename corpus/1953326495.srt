No bedsores?

23

Clear.

24
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:36,897
No pulse?

25
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:43,074
Clear.

26
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:48,341
Why do you keep having
to push them buttons?

27
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:53,613
Sometimes things
need to be reset.

28
00:03:53,614 --> 00:04:01,591
Did you ever have to
reset a prolapsed anus?

29
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,727
Do you even... Do you
know what that is?

30
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:09,766
Have you ever... Have
you ever had to deal

31
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,766
with a prolapsed an... anus?

32
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:18,438
Chief?

33
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,975
Did they teach you
that in nurse school?

34
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,445
You and the ladies
get that lesson?

35
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:30,048
I'll tell you what. I'll give
you a little lesson on it.

36
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:35,553
A prolapsed anus is when the
anus, which is a muscle, gives

37
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,822
out, after years of abuse.

38
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:45,823
Comes out of the rear and hangs
like a, like a slack bag of tissue.

39
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:53,540
Like a purse that you might have...
A nurse would have.

40
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:58,011
Can you imagine what it would
take to make your anus do that?

41
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:03,683
A lot of butt fucking.

42
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:08,088
The old man's probably got
a prolapsed amus... anus.

43
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:15,996
Anus and Andy.

44
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:22,105
Nothing?

45
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,039
Famous anus cookies.

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,550
Anything there?

47
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,982
So you change my dad?

48
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:41,955
You put diapers on him and
clean his asshole, and take...

49
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:48,041
Put his shit in a bag, throw it
out, put it down the toilet?

50
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,876
Pretty cool.

51
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:08,849
Pretty cool way to live.

52
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,084
I wonder if my dad's shit
has ever gotten under your

53
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,653
fingernails, and then you
forgot, and you are driving

54
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:18,492
home, worrying about... worrying
about your life, and you start

55
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:21,494
biting your fingernails, and
his shit gets in your mouth.

56
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:23,028
You got to be careful.

57
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:27,701
Make sure you wash them hands.

58
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,568
Okay.

59
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:36,841
Adios.

60
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:10,010
Yeah.

61
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:47,068
What's up?

62
00:09:50,471 --> 00:09:54,040
I know, but we can bring
something else in, right?

63
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,744
Do we need something with
evergreens that's gonna last...

64
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,879
I just want you to look
at this bush here because

65
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,014
it's looking really...
It's pretty bad.

66
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:06,118
Yeah, I don't know if
there's a bug on it.

67
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,953
Look at the leaves on there.

68
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:11,823
And it's all been chewed,
and it's unbalanced.

69
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,458
It doesn't fit.

70
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,730
Yeah, and it's blocking
this thing here.

71
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:20,100
Most of when you get the flies, they...
the cuts are much more round.

72
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,202
That could be the larvae
going through it.

73
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:27,372
But I remember a grapevine...
It's comin' along, huh?

74
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:30,241
Yeah, yeah, looks great.
Getting there.

75
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,244
Good job.

76
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,345
Hey, what are these?

77
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,147
These are looking very weedy.

78
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,381
Those are out of here, right?

79
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:42,918
I love the black-eyed Susan.

80
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,389
<i>Nadar LA piscina, I guess.</i>

81
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,025
<i>Nadar LA piscina.</i>

82
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:51,230
Yeah, yeah, sure. It's my guys
here don't speak any English.

83
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:56,067
<i>They keep saying, "nadar LA
piscina, nadar LA piscina!</i>

84
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:56,936
Swim in your pool."

85
00:10:56,937 --> 00:11:00,938
<i>So they're always going
to me "nadar LA piscina?"</i>

86
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,975
That's great. "Can we
swim in their pool?"

87
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:07,379
I go, "well, you know,
it's private property.

88
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,917
Yeah, it's gotten hot
out here for sure.

89
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:12,317
This is looking a little
troubled over here.

90
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:15,455
This one's shading it so badly.

91
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:18,358
Let's get more light under it.

92
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:23,261
What do you say if me and my
guys took a quick little dip?

93
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:29,302
What do you think?

94
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:33,907
They want to swim.

95
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,975
Why not?

96
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,177
I suppose.

97
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:40,313
Yeah, yeah, sure.

98
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,514
Sure.

99
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:44,249
Once they've finished here.

100
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,154
They're gonna mow before
they go, as well, right?

101
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,490
We can get you some towels. The
housekeeper will get you some towels.

102
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,185
No, that's fine.

103
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:58,959
Yeah.

104
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:21,019
I had a great day.

105
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,624
I went to the shopping mall.

106
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:29,195
I feel so good about hanging out
with my best friends today.

107
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,629
Who are your best friends?

108
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,999
All my loved ones
are in this room.

109
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,469
I want to thank everybody for
being so kind and considerate.

110
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,040
How about a round of applause
just for the five of us?

111
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:45,411
I respect my friends that come to
my house that has an artistic vibe.

112
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,181
Obviously, the host of
this house cares about

113
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:51,651
art and the visual space
and the energy within, and

114
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:55,053
he respects all his friends that
he invites over here equally.

115
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:59,191
I love when I go to my
friend's house and their

116
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:00,326
bathroom's really, really clean.

117
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:06,599
There's not pubic hair on
the rim of the toilet seat.

118
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,034
I'm with you on that.

119
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,035
Yeah.

120
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:14,605
Oh, and speaking of bathrooms,
I wanted to confess something.

121
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:20,178
I used... you have a box of always feminine
wipes in there, and I used a couple.

122
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:24,349
Just... my clitoris
was really messy.

123
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,418
So I had to wash up.

124
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:33,292
You have these terrific comedic
instincts, and then you

125
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:36,495
immediately sabotage them
with the worst follow-up.

126
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:37,629
The worst?

127
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,932
A terrible sense of humor.

128
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,202
So you know all comedians
ever, so you are qualified to

129
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:45,370
say what is the absolute worst.
You've heard all comedians ever.

130
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,572
No, it's in my opinion.

131
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,208
Well, then you can't use an
absolute term like "the worst."

132
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,276
I can do whatever I want.

133
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:52,345
Then give me a French kiss.

134
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:53,947
Well, fine, who disagrees?

135
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:56,048
Does he have a terrible
sense of humor?

136
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,683
Does he?

137
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:58,551
Absolutely.

138
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,653
The cool thing about a group of

139
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:03,184
friends is that you got
the smart one, the

140
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:05,557
cool one, the musical
one, and the funny guy.

141
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:09,529
And that just makes it, like,
a well-rounded cool group,

142
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,065
you know, to hang out
with at my house.

143
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:16,335
We're like the... The avengers.

144
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:20,639
God, you were supposed
to say something funny.

145
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,242
That was your cue to,
like, boom, good joke.

146
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:28,247
I want to take this moment to
just acknowledge how strong

147
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:31,149
of a bond and what a great sense

148
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,687
of community I feel
amongst everybody here.

149
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:37,223
I mean, I really appreciate all
the support, and I appreciate,

150
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:42,995
you know, the friendship
honestly, so God bless ya.

151
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:45,098
Let me say it, I never... I
never had a family, okay?

152
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:49,502
Because my parents, as you guys
know, died really early on.

153
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:54,007
I was raised in foster homes.

154
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:57,009
This is my family.

155
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,311
Here's to my family.

156
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,179
You are so special.

157
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,316
You are so special to us.

158
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:08,220
You are so important to my life.

159
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:11,391
I need you.

160
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:15,660
I don't say that to... I
don't say that to anybody.

161
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:19,029
I mean, I would say it.

162
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,133
I'd say it to all four of you.

163
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:28,673
Three syllables, I need you.

164
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:33,613
Hey, let's put 'em up here.

165
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:35,314
I'm not fucking toasting him.

166
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:40,252
To the four of us here.

167
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,553
Thank you, cheers. Bottoms up.

168
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:49,190

a socialist state, you
know, situation."

179
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:12,442
And honestly people don't
really even understand that

180
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:13,978
there's many versions of that.

181
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:21,979
Well... I-I think
there's a third way.

182
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:26,093
Is this the middle finger
that's about to emerge?

183
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:28,861
Well, I think people gave
up too early on feudalism.

184
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,563
Oh.

185
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,531
Yeah.

186
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,733
You know, you know, there's
this theory that there's, like,

187
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:40,438
a large percentage of the population
of human beings on the planet

188
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:45,178
that don't have, like,
conscious thought.

189
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,681
Oh, you mean like a unique...
unique thought.

190
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:51,549
Like, yeah, they're just drones.

191
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,319
They just go to the river, you
know, you look... like Bangladesh

192
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,856
or something, and they just,
like, go to the river and have

193
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:02,228
their week's worth of laundry
on their head... or a basket...

194
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:05,698
And they just fucking wash their
shit, and that's all they think.

195
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:09,268
It's like, "well, today I'm
gonna wash my laundry,

196
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,204
you know, like, why am
I here or anything."

197
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:17,209
But, I mean, the unfortunate
thing is, like, that our...

198
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,246
Our politics and our garbage
affects those people,

199
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:26,282
but they're not actively... So
you're saying you wish that

200
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,287
everybody was on that level.

201
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:33,824
No, I think that
there's some people

202
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:38,330
that deserve to be... To have their life...
Their life is better

203
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,266
because they deserve it.
Oh, I see.

204
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,367
Oh, I see.

205
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:45,972
I mean, because they're...
They're picked by God.

206
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:46,972
Ordained, sovereigned.

207
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:49,477
Yeah, yeah, the idea...
they are genetically chosen

208
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,643
to be on top of the
fuckin' food chain. Wow!

209
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,511
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,646
You're blowing my mind.

211
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:56,948
Because it's very unpopular.

212
00:18:56,949 --> 00:19:00,886
Yeah, I think it's... yeah,
it's generally considered...

213
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,255
And it's not racism either.
That's the trick.

214
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:03,722
Oh, it's just...
It's just human.

215
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:04,888
You're just, like, doing...

216
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:08,027
There's black guys that deserve to
have it just as much as white guys.

217
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:12,765
This is like evolutionary imperative
is what you're talking about.

218
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,633
Kind of.

219
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:15,300
I didn't take that
class in college.

220
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,301
Neither did I.

221
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,836
Neither did I.

222
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,805
So I probably don't know what
I'm fucking saying anyway.

223
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:26,278
You know, I mean... You
know, Hitler had...

224
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,882
You didn't just
say, "Hitler had."

225
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:31,784
Hitler had... What?

226
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:32,852
Ideas.

227
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,719
Uh-huh.

228
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,623
I'm not a... you know, a Nazi
or anything, but I think

229
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:42,327
that he gets... he deserves
a little bit of credit.

230
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,962
Um, yeah.

231
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:47,967
You know, for... not for...
For killing any,

232
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:52,096
you know, forget... take him...
Take genocide out of the...

233
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:54,573
Murder out of the equation... Sure.

234
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:59,812
He was kind of like a, uh...

235
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:05,918
Like a... Like a male
cheerleader for his own people.

236
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,689
I will say he was an
incredible public speaker.

237
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,655
Very, very good.

238
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:15,393
He also had horrible
indigestion.

239
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,328
This is true.

240
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,331
He had... he had, like, gas.

241
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:19,332
He had gas problems.

242
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,334
Is that why his belt
was always so high up?

243
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:24,670
Well, if you watch... If
you watch his speeches,

244
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:30,809
he would do his... And then at the
end, people would be applauding,

245
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,614
and he would go... No, that's just...
It's true.

246
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:36,656
Check it out.

247
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:42,630
Look on YouTube.

248
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,797
Wake up.

249
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:39,613
Wake up.

250
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:23,548
If it comes to damage to an
apartment caused by shit

251
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:27,116
or piss or vomit or
blood, it's usually one

252
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:32,621
of our well-to-do tenants.

253
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,160
The low-income poverty level guys...
they'll spray taco grease

254
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:38,730
all over the wall...
On the ceiling.

255
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:41,834
Maybe some bacon
grease in the drains.

256
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,803
You know, you got
to get that out.

257
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:52,010
But for the most part, even though they...
They're idiots.

258
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:55,079
They keep it a little
tidier, you know?

259
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,951
Don't have that sense of
entitlement about shitting

260
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:04,656
all over our property.

261
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:06,258
Yup.

262
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:12,030
I'd like to just keep a
couple of the tenants,

263
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,699
throw out all the others.

264
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,633
Let the hobos take over.

265
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,635
Turn it into a hobo jungle.

266
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:24,075
I don't have to be on the
fucking phone with McClaren

267
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:27,845
about all this shit three
times, four times a day.

268
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:32,050
Don't have to waste your
time filling you in.

269
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,614
You let these hobos take over,

270
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:35,854
they're, again, tidy
people, tidy people.

271
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:38,123
Hobos are tidy people?

272
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:43,261
They're the cleanest...
Cleanest people you'd ever meet

273
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:48,901
because... I mean, their asses are
dirty, but their cocks are clean

274
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:51,069
as a baby's breath.

275
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,271
Yeah.

276
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:58,776
Hobo dicks are cleaner than... I
was reading this the other day.

277
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:01,980
Hobo dicks are cleaner
than hospital scalpels.

278
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,316
I mean, they're like...
They've done, you know...

279
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:08,053
They've taken hobo dicks under
microscopes and have been

280
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:15,025
unable to detect any
bacteria of any kind.

281
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,929
It's like 99.9% pure cock.

282
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,264
Everybody know... Because
their cocks are sucked

283
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:20,766
so repeatedly, it's like going...

284
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:25,635
It's like taking your
car to a car wash.

285
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:27,422
If you're a hobo, you go
down to the fucking wall

286
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,208
street and wait around
until about 5:01 P.M.

287
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,194
These stockbrokers come
out all looking for

288
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,112
hobo dick to suck, you
know what I mean?

289
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:34,846
Dicks are already hard.

290
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:38,717
And they Polish the... They
Polish the fucking cocks so

291
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:42,253
They get their dicks hard in the
elevator coming down knowing

292
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,422
that those hobos are out there
with their mouths wide open.

293
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:45,723
Wide open.

294
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:48,661
Those fucking hobos have to get
injections of semen into their

295
00:25:48,662 --> 00:25:53,297
fucking scrotum so that they can
ejaculate enough to fill the

296
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:56,869
need of these stock-broke
fucks who just love

297
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,439
dirty, homeless semen,
and that's documented.

00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:29,679
I got to know 'em personally.

352
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:36,425
Some of them I know
by their first name.

353
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:45,696
Old man be dead
by now, I expect.

354
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:51,203
Ain't breathin' too good.

355
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:57,209
I expect he won't shine too...
Too kindly on our family.

356
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,944
He got one son out
there on a boat.

357
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:05,683
He got another boy up
there in the looney bin,

358
00:35:05,684 --> 00:35:10,455
married to some whore who rubs...

359
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:15,931
Who rubs... rubs sh...
Shit on her vagina.

360
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:22,734
Some 'ho got... you the kind of

361
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:26,937
whore that... You the kind
of whore that swallows cum.

362
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:32,949
You are my only cum-swallowing
sister-in-law, and I appreciate it.

363
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:40,718
Cum swallower.

364
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:49,597
That's the proudest thing
to be in this family.

365
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:58,502
So how... So how long, uh...

366
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:01,672
How long you think they're
going to keep him up in there?

367
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:07,010
So are they weaning him off the
stuff, or how's that work?

368
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:08,480
What's the process?

369
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:11,780
Are you really asking that?

370
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,852
I'm curious. He's my bro.

371
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,987
I care about my bro.

372
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:19,857
Want to make sure
he's doing good.

373
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,061
You get to go up there for
any kind of conjugal visits?

374
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:26,665
You get to go... You
get to, you know...

375
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,732
Fuck him?

376
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:31,770
Suck him?

377
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:37,374
Do they have to keep him in
some kind of straitjacket

378
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,765
and, like, let you jerk him off?

379
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:45,088
I mean, what's going
on with that?

380
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:46,477
Uh, can I get a pabst?

381
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:53,123
Give me a glass or what?

382
00:37:58,123 --> 00:38:04,696
Oh, Jesus.

383
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:07,131
Hey, you guys hiring here?

384
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:10,734
Looking for anybody to
help out around the bar?

385
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,870
I'm looking for work.

386
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:13,738
No.

387
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:16,073
No.

388
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:20,511
I could, you know, get some
different kind of people in here.

389
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:23,047
You know what I mean?
A little diversity?

390
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:24,581
Is that right?

391
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:25,449
Yeah.

392
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:32,992
I could get my buddies to come
in and spend a lot of money.

393
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:36,560
Got to think about a whole...
This whole area

394
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:38,162
is the next place where people
are going to be hanging out,

395
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,163
and you got to get some people

396
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:46,936
in here so they don't
feel so intimidated.

397
00:38:46,937 --> 00:38:47,938
Mm.

398
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,873
But I love it though;

399
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,842
It's like a good fucking bar.

400
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:55,013
It's, like, good
energy and everything.

401
00:38:55,014 --> 00:39:00,517
Good location.

402
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:02,186
Where you from?

403
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:06,155
I'm in williamsburg, you know?

404
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:06,941
So, represent.

405
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:07,658
Represent what?

406
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,526
What?

407
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:11,095
I'm representing
williamsburg, bro!

408
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:14,731
You got to respect where I
come from, because I respect

409
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:16,867
where you come from.

410
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,202
Come on.

411
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:19,872
You know where we come from?

412
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:21,473
You come from "the hood."

413
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:23,107
Right?
I know.

414
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,108
I'm cool.

415
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,010
I'm with you guys.

416
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,313
I'm on your side.

417
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:29,546
I'm just hanging out. I'm
just trying to explore.

418
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:32,083
I'm trying to get out
of my comfort zone,

419
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:36,488
trying to be cool and hang out
with cool guys like you dudes.

420
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:40,824
This is about respecting
this block, 'cause I get it.

421
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:44,494
I understand that you guys are...
You know, work hard or,

422
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,030
you know, have a lot of history.

423
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,264
For real, man.

424
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:52,934
I don't mean to be
disrespectful, but you guys look

425
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,737
like you could be tough guys.

426
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:56,707
You guys are, like, tough guys.
What a tough guy look like?

427
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,042
Like a black guy.

428
00:39:58,043 --> 00:39:59,910
Oh, wow!

429
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:02,180
That's a stereotype now, Jack.

430
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:04,515
Hey, you can fucking...
You stereotype me.

431
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:07,285
You fucking look at me and think...
you make all sorts of

432
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,021
Well, what, you a
yuppie or something?

433
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,821
Yeah, 'cause I got
fucking money.

434
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:13,625
Because, you know, I come from...
You got money?

435
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,694
Yeah. Yeah?
How much money you got?

436
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:17,160
Right now, 20 bucks.

437
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:18,696
So you're shit out of luck.

438
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:21,665
You can't fucking stab me.

439
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:25,837
You can't fucking stab me!

440
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,541
We got some credit
cards over here, man.

441
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:30,774
Where are your fucking
bitches, though, man?

442
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:35,045
You got to fucking pay for 'em
in this part of town, right?

443
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:36,581
I want some black ass.

444
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:39,616
I want to fuck some
fucking black ass.

445
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,286
B-I-g.

446
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:44,820
♪ We all hanging out ♪

447
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,690
♪ we all hanging on the block ♪

448
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:48,692

449

♪ bitch, a bitch ♪

450
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:56,333
Now I'm trying to be honest with
you, and you all up in my grill.

451
00:40:56,368 --> 00:41:02,872
Up in your grill!
Bet you listen to radio too much, huh, Jack?

452
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:27,951
Well...

453
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:34,423
We could get Tony to come in and
cut like a dog... cat door...

454
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:38,162
Pet door here and put
a sign on that says,

455
00:43:38,163 --> 00:43:41,332
"techno... techno
night, $25 bucks."

456
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,067
Lock it up at 4:00 A.M.

457
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:47,738
Then we do the controlled
demolition, and then you sell

458
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:53,297
all the techno idiots as
scrap meat to the renderer.

459
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:21,039
I've had dishwashing
jobs in the past.

460
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,039
You have?

461
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,839
Yes.

462
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,978
And you show up to work on time,
and you do your job properly,

463
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,880
and you scrub hard and all that?

464
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:31,015
Absolutely. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

465
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:36,988
I have Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Saturday lunch shifts.

466
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:40,892
Okay, yeah, that would be...
That'd work for me.

467
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:44,995
And how much are you
looking to get paid?

468
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,230
I don't know what the rate is.

469
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,300
I guess, like, $10 an hour?

470
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:51,134
- $7.25.
- Okay, that's good.

471
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:52,303
That's fine.

472
00:44:52,304 --> 00:44:54,872
Yeah, 10... How old are you?

473
00:44:54,873 --> 00:44:58,075
I'm 35.

474
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:01,412
I'll take a little hit.

475
00:45:01,413 --> 00:45:02,446
Just a touch.

476
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:03,346
Just tell me when.

477
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:07,018
You tell me when, okay? Just
pour it like a regular man.

478
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,704
I'm not a regular man.

479
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,321
I can't do it that way.

480
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:12,189
Just fuck it.

481
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,026
I'll just have champagne.

482
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:20,862
But speaking of American terrorists,
I was just reading this thing

483
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:22,533
about Timothy McVeigh. Apparently,
and I didn't know this,

484
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:27,104
but I was reading this, apparently,
that building had it coming.

485
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:28,137
He said, "it deserved it."

486
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:30,007
That building was a
fucking asshole.

487
00:45:30,008 --> 00:45:31,875
I read that, too.

488
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:37,014
Cargill has to wait 30
seconds before he makes

489
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:39,082
any comment on any subject
or any conversation piece.

490
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:43,221
So that you have... There is
some kind of a clearance period;

491
00:45:43,222 --> 00:45:45,456
A decontamination zone
for your thoughts.

492
00:45:45,457 --> 00:45:50,626
Also, go... you could
also do the rules of ten.

493
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:52,929
Every tenth thought comes out.
You know what I mean?

494
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,099
You got a thought, you're like,
"okay, that's one, save it."

495
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,633
Store it. "Two."

496
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:57,501
Maybe destroy it.

497
00:45:57,502 --> 00:45:58,369
Up to ten.

498
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,872
Comment, wait for a pause.

499
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:03,107
Yeah, let's try it out.

500
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:06,443
I think we are in the
process of trying it out.

501
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:08,346
I think you have no
concept of time.

502
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:11,114
I bet if you... Somebody
with a timer checked...

503
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:13,317
You have an hourglass
in your pocket?

504
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:15,486
What do you think ten
seconds feels like?

505
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:17,053
You tell me when ten seconds is up.
Ready?

506
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:18,256
Hold on.

507
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:24,393
I bet it's gonna
be three seconds.

508
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:25,328
Ready?

509
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:26,195
No overestimating.

510
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:27,065
That's cheating.

511
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:27,931
Ready? Go.

512
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:30,500
No, I'm not ready.

513
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:34,205
I prefer if we started again,
because I wasn't ready.

514
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:37,440
Ask me if I'm ready, and
then I'll say, "yes,"

515
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,509
and then you start. All
right, are you ready?

516
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,377
Yes.

517
00:46:40,378 --> 00:46:42,312
Here we go. Start.

00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,215

519
00:46:44,216 --> 00:46:45,919

Hey, put on some hip-hop.

523
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:10,040
I'm sorry, guys,
the radio's broke.

524
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,009
No music today.

525
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,609
No, no.
I am sorry.

526
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,178
Radio, and then the hip-hop.

527
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:19,416
Why don't you fuckers have
satellite radio in this cab?

528
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,419
You pay so much fucking
money for these cabs.

529
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,553
You should have the option to

530
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:25,356
listen to whatever kind
of music you want.

531
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:26,222
Hip-hop.

Oh, oh, no.

612
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:38,760
No, sir.

613
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:42,630
I rent it... a lease.

614
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:43,634

620
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:16,667
Yeah, because a lot of you fuckers
don't keep your cabs clean.

No res... no dis... no disrespect.

622
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:30,378
I always thought it would be
kind of fun to drive around,

623
00:54:30,379 --> 00:54:35,117
you know, meeting weird people and...
I don't know.

624
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:37,154
- I'm a good driver.
- You don't look like a cab driver, sir.

625
00:54:37,155 --> 00:54:41,820
Yeah, well, let's... We should change
the way people think of cab drivers.

626
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:49,097
I'll tell you what, man.

627

you if you let me drive my...

You don't trust me?

630
00:54:59,443 --> 00:55:01,779
I got a driver's license.

Sir, you are very distracting!

643
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:47,223
I'm trying to talk to you. I'm
not going to give you my cab.

644
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:50,861
All right, listen, I'm trying

opportunities.

661

Do... do you want to make $400 right

662
00:56:40,143 --> 00:56:41,115
I'm being serious.

It's gonna be fine.

671
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:26,856
No, I need... can you... You
need to sit in the back.

672
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,125
Is it cool if you do the back?

673
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:29,395
It's like the whole experience.
You know what I mean?

674
00:57:29,396 --> 00:57:32,061
No, no.

00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:25,840
Hey, no, no!

704
00:59:25,841 --> 00:59:26,943
Hey, hey.

705
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:28,811
Okay, no more.

706
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:29,713
Enough!

707
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:31,380
Hey!

708
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:33,282
Please, stop the car!

709
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:34,868
You need to stop the car now!

710
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:36,385
I need you to stop the car now!

711
00:59:36,386 --> 00:59:37,820
Pull over now!

712
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:38,688
Hey!

713
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:41,957
I need to get out...
Shut the fuck up!

714
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:43,025
Shut the fuck up, all right?
I am calling the police!

715
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:46,062
- Is that pussy for sale?
- You think I'm a fucking prostitute?

716
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:47,063
You need to stop the car!

717
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:48,798
Is this your block?

718
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,766
Stop it!

719
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:52,435
Fuck you!
You got to... fuck.

720
00:59:52,436 --> 00:59:54,136
Fuck you, you fucking pimp!

721
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,971
Fuck you, fuck you!

722
00:59:55,972 --> 01:00:02,041
Get away from me!

723
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:44,221
Yo.

724
01:00:44,222 --> 01:00:46,422
Hey.

725
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:48,524
What's up?

726
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:50,893
Are you gonna get out?

727
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:51,828
Hmm?

728
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:55,764
So I've made everything
really easy.

729
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:57,432
This is completely filled out.

730
01:00:57,433 --> 01:01:00,136
I just need your signature and a
time to go to a notary together.

731
01:01:00,137 --> 01:01:01,004
All right.

732
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:03,406
Well, let me go out to my boat.

733
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:04,842
I can take a look at it.

734
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:06,209
We can talk about it.

735
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,077
Get a drink.

736
01:01:07,078 --> 01:01:10,413
It's just gonna be a lot
easier if every single time

737
01:01:10,414 --> 01:01:13,316
an easy thing needs to happen with
your family... All right, well,

738
01:01:13,317 --> 01:01:15,050
I'm just telling you
I can't do it here.

739
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,052
It's maritime law;

740
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:19,456
I cannot discuss official business
on the slip or on the dinghy.

741
01:01:19,457 --> 01:01:23,489
It's got to be on the boat.

742
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:30,280
So we going on the boat?
Come on.

743
01:04:55,572 --> 01:05:03,414
Do you have those clean glasses?

744
01:05:03,414 --> 01:05:08,685
I'm sorry, are you deaf?

745
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:11,221
Oh, God, your fucking breath.

746
01:05:11,222 --> 01:05:12,788
It smells like this dirty... oh.

747
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,626
I can't tell if it's the
trash here or your breath.

748
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:17,327
There was something I
was meaning to ask you.

749
01:05:17,328 --> 01:05:20,229
Have you tried using the dish
soap to clean out your asshole?

750
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,130
Yeah, I use it all the time.
Because you stink.

751
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:22,833
Actually, this is
where I shower.

752
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:24,467
I showe... I put my head in here.

753
01:05:24,468 --> 01:05:26,069
You can fit it in there?

754
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,173
Rodrigo was asking me about
making some bread, and

755
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:30,238
I guess they're out of yeast.

756
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:34,308
So they're wondering if they
could use some of the yeast

757
01:05:34,343 --> 01:05:35,079
Because I noticed how
infected it gets.

758
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,798
Yeah, he spoke to me about
that, and I directed

759
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:40,550
him to ask you about
your dick cheese.

760
01:05:40,551 --> 01:05:42,085
Okay.

761
01:05:42,086 --> 01:05:44,219
See if that would maybe help.

762
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,521
Oh, wow.

763
01:05:45,522 --> 01:05:46,607
So good.

764
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:47,624
So funny.

765
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,592
You're so funny.

766
01:05:49,593 --> 01:05:50,460
You are!

767
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:51,327
You are.

768
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:58,701
I didn't realize you were so funny.
I didn't realize you were.

769
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:01,136
You know I'm a convicted
rapist, right?

770
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:03,205
They told you that?

771
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:04,072
Oh, really?

772
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,074
I thought they were supposed

773
01:06:05,075 --> 01:06:08,310
to let all the employees
know about that.

774
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:14,517
Yeah, I rape anything I can
get my hands on, all right?

775
01:06:14,518 --> 01:06:18,654
Mm-hmm.

776
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:23,759
Are these for you?

777
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,694
Thank you.

778
01:06:24,695 --> 01:06:26,563
Okay, great!

779
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:27,429
Bye.

780
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:29,331
Good luck!

781
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:35,232
Bye.

782
01:06:43,646 --> 01:06:44,747
Fuck!

783
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:46,515
Oh, shit!

784
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:47,549
Yo.

785
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,652
God damn it!

786
01:06:50,653 --> 01:06:52,288
Motherfucker!

787
01:06:52,289 --> 01:06:54,156
Fuckin' cunt!

788
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:56,157
Bitch!

789
01:06:56,158 --> 01:06:57,126
Fuck!

790
01:06:57,127 --> 01:06:58,161
Fuck!

791
01:06:58,162 --> 01:06:59,469
Fuck me!

792
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:05,708
Fuck!

793
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:17,481
Ow!

794
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:21,484
Yeah, you're gonna have
to keep this wound clean.

795
01:07:21,485 --> 01:07:27,356
Every day you have to clean
it, change the bandage.

796
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:30,159
And in seven days, you're gonna
have the sutures removed.

797
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,427
Is that all right?

798
01:07:31,428 --> 01:07:32,594
How does it feel?

799
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:36,933
It hurts, okay.

800
01:07:36,934 --> 01:07:43,510
Hold that, please.

801
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:33,343
Hello?

802
01:10:33,344 --> 01:10:40,881
Hello?

803
01:11:11,881 --> 01:11:18,388
How does that feel?

804
01:11:18,389 --> 01:11:25,417
Where do you like your part?

805
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:50,118
Feels good right?

806
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:54,991
How's he doing?

807
01:11:54,992 --> 01:11:56,559
Just have to change this.

808
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,902
Oh, you're fine.

809
01:11:57,903 --> 01:12:04,177
Nope, you're fine.

810
01:14:20,203 --> 01:14:27,953
Order in.

811
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:09,617
No gag reflex.

812
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:22,829
This is the exact size
and shape of my penis.

813
01:15:24,234 --> 01:15:31,975
The rumors are true.

814
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:45,722
Oh, shit.

815
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:54,975
You don't need to... You
don't need to pull a lot.

816
01:16:04,975 --> 01:16:08,010
God damn it!

817
01:16:08,011 --> 01:16:10,179
Jesus Christ.

818
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,746
No, it's not... I got to do lower.

819
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:17,819
God damn it!

820
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,854
What was that supposed to be?

821
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:23,291
Nick nolte.

822
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,227
"God damn it.

823
01:16:25,228 --> 01:16:26,828
Jesus Christ.

824
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:31,267
That's some good...
That's some good pot.

825
01:16:31,268 --> 01:16:35,237
There's no goddamn way we're
gonna get up that hill.

826
01:16:35,238 --> 01:16:43,055
There's no goddamn way we're
gettin' off this boat!"

827
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:55,189
You want this?

828
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,926
I'm good.

829
01:16:57,927 --> 01:17:03,331
Any suggestions as to
where I should put it?

830
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:06,035
Put it with my other vices.

831
01:17:06,036 --> 01:17:09,938
Your drug paraphernalia.

832
01:17:09,939 --> 01:17:13,142
It's fucking hot.

833
01:17:13,143 --> 01:17:16,511
Un... untangle that
sweater off yourself.

834
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:17,813
What?

835
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:19,881
You should take
your sweater off.

836
01:17:19,882 --> 01:17:23,519
There's very liberal
policies here for clothing.

837
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:29,157
You know, you could pretty
much wear whatever you want.

838
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:34,328
Make yourself at home, you know?

839
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:36,163
Make you... make yourself at boat.

840
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:36,965
Boat home?

841
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:42,772
Need some help?

842
01:17:42,773 --> 01:17:46,242
I'm gonna do a little
tease for you here.

843
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:49,779
This is sort of how I seal
the deal with the girls.

844
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:52,313
Oh, that's... I do one
of these numbers.

845
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,450
One button, buttoned in.

846
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:56,184
Keep this tight.

847
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:59,455
And then, just let it loose.

848
01:17:59,456 --> 01:18:02,557
That's the moment of a lifetime.

849
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:03,425
I know.

850
01:18:03,426 --> 01:18:08,496
It's such... you don't want to
just reveal it all right away.

851
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:16,438
This shirt does not breathe.

852
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:17,339
Better?

853
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,407
Oh, my God.

854
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:20,275
What a relief.

855
01:18:20,276 --> 01:18:27,403
What a big difference
that makes, huh?

856
01:18:46,403 --> 01:18:49,505
What happens when you...
What happens to this button

857
01:18:49,506 --> 01:18:51,540
That's... that's a good one.

858
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:55,409
This is an actual
functional button.

859
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,478
That's an important button.

860
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:59,546
Wow.

861
01:18:59,547 --> 01:19:02,483
I do like that button.
I prefer it open.

862
01:19:02,484 --> 01:19:05,420
Oh, I see, this is... This
zipper actually works.

863
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:06,621
This is a fully
functioning zipper, too.

864
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:11,940
Oh, yeah, that's... What happens...
What's down here?

865
01:21:51,755 --> 01:21:53,622
All right.

866
01:21:53,623 --> 01:21:58,489
Yup.

867
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:59,594
Hold on.

868
01:21:59,595 --> 01:22:02,630
All right.

869
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:09,139
I'll see you at work.

870
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:10,171
Okay, see ya.

871
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:16,612
Bye.

872
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:19,113
Oh.

873
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:21,582
Easy.

874
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,085
Swing it around.

875
01:22:23,086 --> 01:22:28,724
Swing it around.

876
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:34,696
There we go.

877
01:22:34,697 --> 01:22:38,367
So what... what is this?

878
01:22:38,368 --> 01:22:44,439
A sl... a slide of fish.

879
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,207
Wow.

880
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:52,079
It's a big fuckin' dog, or I guess
it's a really, really small man.

881
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:54,315
That's my father Dan
and his dog Jake.

882
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:55,583
That's your dad?

883
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:56,819
My dad.

884
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:00,089
Why does he have that collar on?

885
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:02,357
I mean, why does your
dad wear a collar?

886
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:05,861
Oh, that was so funny, and
then it was so not funny.

887
01:23:05,862 --> 01:23:09,131
He got a laugh, and
then the second time...

888
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:16,377
Like, you think we
didn't hear you?

889
01:23:21,377 --> 01:23:27,483
My dad.

890
01:23:27,484 --> 01:23:29,484
That's Jake. That's John.

891
01:23:29,485 --> 01:23:32,487
That's my sister Rita.

892
01:23:32,488 --> 01:23:36,825
That's my dad in yellow, and that's
me with the... Who's the cop?

893
01:23:36,826 --> 01:23:40,694
That's John.

894
01:23:40,695 --> 01:23:42,130
That's my brother.

895
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:44,545
Mom's taking the shot,
and dad was pissed

896
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:49,470
because he was facing
towards the gift shop.

897
01:23:49,471 --> 01:23:56,144
And my dad has the camera, so who
knows how my mom captured this.

898
01:23:56,145 --> 01:24:00,684
I like the red coat at
the Irish festival.

899
01:24:01,684 --> 01:24:04,452
Northern California.

900
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:09,457
Jake, John, Rita, my mom,
my dad are all present.

901
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:12,161
I took this shot with
my dad's camera.

902
01:24:12,162 --> 01:24:15,496
Wait... why are you
showing us this stuff?

903
01:24:15,497 --> 01:24:19,468
Because of this.

904
01:24:19,469 --> 01:24:20,602
What is it?

905
01:24:20,603 --> 01:24:28,578
It's back in the Irish
town in Canada.
