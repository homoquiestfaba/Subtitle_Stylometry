when it happened,

much beyond that.

stick together.

I gave Carly a bath
every night, so...

01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:14,415
it wasn't out of the

had blood on her.

just gonna go up.

1392
01:31:29,518 --> 01:31:32,519
So, Mr. Kardashi,
what do you think?

1393
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:35,889
I mean, uh, everything
looks good, but, um...

1394
01:31:35,891 --> 01:31:38,959
It's just a little too
small for what we need.

1395
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,597
What about this building here?

1396
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:44,831
Oh, no.

1397
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,233
Nobody's in it, right?

1398
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:49,703
That building's been
empty for a few years.

1399
01:31:49,705 --> 01:31:52,873
This space is perfect
for a parking lot.

1400
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,542
Any chance we could
get our hands on it?

1401
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:58,879
No. I tried that a few years
back for another client,

1402
01:31:58,881 --> 01:32:02,082
but the owner refuses to sell.

1403
01:32:02,084 --> 01:32:03,183
But they're not using it...

1404
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:06,686
Uh, weird, I know, but
they won't go in there,

1405
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,589
and they said no one
else can either, yet.

1406
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:12,225
Come on.
Everybody's got a price.

1407
01:32:12,227 --> 01:32:13,793
Maybe.

1408
01:32:13,795 --> 01:32:15,896
I'll be honest.

1409
01:32:15,898 --> 01:32:17,731
If there's not even a chance,

1410
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:21,034
I don't think we'll be really
interested in this purchase.

1411
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,270
But, if you can
convince them to sell,

1412
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:26,773
I'm sure we can add a little
nice bonus to your commission.

1413
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:28,608
You know what, it has
been four years,

1414
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,745
I'm sure that the owner's changed
his mind by now about selling.

1415
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:33,446
I think I can help you guys out.

1416
01:32:33,448 --> 01:32:35,015
What's in there, anyway?

1417
01:32:35,017 --> 01:32:37,450
They're definitely not gonna
be using this place again.

1418
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,323
