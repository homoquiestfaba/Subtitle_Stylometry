1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,987
North and South came along
and l would've died to get it, you know.

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,300
lt was just one of those roles
of a lifetime.

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,304
This is one With the Wind
for the last half of the 20th century.

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,062
This is one With the Wind
for television.

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,266
l didn't have to create Madeline.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,705
John Jakes created Madeline.

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,143
The popularity of the American Çivil War
and all that goes with it...

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:39,180
... really lies
in the emotion of people...

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,138
... who are close to one another
being torn apart by what they believe...

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,868
... or what they're supposed
to believe.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,387
Roots was the story of the South
from the black point of view.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,427
North and South is the story
of the South...

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,864
... from the white point of view.

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,909
The very first thing that you hear
when the project goes on...

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,868
... is the main title and the music.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,066
And the music is gonna carry
that message...

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,743
... of what is this thing all about.

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,545
Çue marker.

19
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,745
Well, North and South,
the trilogy began...

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,186
... with a three-book contract
that l had.

21
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,228
Originally, it was to be three books...

22
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,747
... about a military family
through the years, one family.

23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,186
l then started to research it.

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,660
And of course, the first place l went to
was West Point.

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,946
Read the history of West Point.

26
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,228
And in one book,
l came across this one page...

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,861
... that named all of the generals
who fought each other...

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,828
... in the Çivil War on opposite sides.

29
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,946
They had all known each other
at West Point.

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,384
They had gone to school together.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,223
They had gone to Mexico together,
fought there.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,065
And l called up my editor
and l said, ''Julian, this has gotta be it.

33
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,461
Now, we're gonna do two families
at West Point...

34
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,542
... and it divides very nicely
into North and South...

35
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,666
... dealing with the antebellum years...

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,628
... Love and War dealing
with the war itself...

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,667
... Heaven and Hell dealing
with Reconstruction. ''

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,582
And that was it,
but it was an evolution.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,105
Well, the North and South
came about...

40
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,500
... because l actually got a call
from ABÇ...

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,104
... they just bought a book
called North and South.

42
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,669
l had just done Roots.

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,582
l did The Thorn Birds for them,
they said:

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,263
''We couldn't think
of anybody better...

45
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,785
... we'd like to turn over
the whole project but to you. ''

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,669
So l read the book, the first book,
right away.

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,502
l said it's a great, juicy story.

48
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,423
John Jakes is a very juicy writer.

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,784
lt was material that could be adapted
so well for the form, the long form...

50
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,578
... in which feature films can't do...

51
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,663
... because they're compressed
into an hour and a half or two hours.

52
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,342
And this story needed a lot of time
to be told.

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,546
To be told effectively
and to be told the right way.

54
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,261
l knew l had to do a formidable amount
of research for the trilogy.

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,345
First of all, because the Çivil War
is such an enormously popular subject...

56
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,149
... not only in the United States,
but around the world.

57
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,259
Today, the Çivil War is called sometimes
the Brothers' War, the Çousins' War.

58
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,902
And phrases like that
really exemplify the split...

59
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,188
... the painful split
that took part in our country.

60
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,590
y ou know, years ago...

61
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,423
... John Çalhoun said
that West Point men...

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,024
... would lead great armies.

63
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,499
He never thought they'd be leading them
against each other.

64
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,265
And l hadn't really realized
it was that deep or that harrowing.

65
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,227
But that was the whole point
that emerged...

66
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,621
... in writing North and South
was these two guys basically...

67
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,906
... who had a great affection
for one another...

68
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,107
... as West Point classmates.

69
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,987
At the end, when war broke out,
they were pulled apart.

70
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,543
They each had to go their own way.

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,066
And it was more
than just a casual decision.

72
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,825
lt was very, very emotional.

73
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,379
l tell you, we didn't have any problems
with the theme...

74
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,622
... with any controversy
with the North and South...

75
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,667
... for one particular reason.

76
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,060
y ou heard the South's point of view...

77
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,784
... and you heard the North's point
of view, so it wasn't... .

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,783
y ou heard slavery.

79
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,510
But then you heard the people
in the North saying how bad it was.

80
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,185
l was really intrigued
with this time period...

81
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,708
... because, at the same time,
it was a coming-of-age story...

82
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,906
... in many ways for Orry and George.

83
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,745
lt was a coming-of-age period
in my life as Patrick, you know.

84
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,788
Having to really analyze
and look at who l am...

85
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,021
... and what l was about
and who l thought l was...

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,703
... as opposed to who l really was.

87
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,979
Television has its place...

88
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,142
... and North and South definitely
had its place telling the story...

89
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,185
... of certain aspects of slavery...

90
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,745
... seen from a white man's
perspective.

91
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,826
l think it did marvelous things
with Virgilia's character, you know...

92
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,345
... the abolitionists and all of that.

93
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,065
Reading John Jakes' books
gave me great insight...

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,667
... but it also prodded me
to do a lot more research.

95
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,866
And also delve
into my own family tree.

96
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,021
Some who have died
and some who spent time...

97
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,069
... in Çonfederate prison camps,
and so forth...

98
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,509
... so that really brought it
very close to me.

99
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,069
The only thing l determined...

100
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,745
... before l started
writing North and South...

101
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,388
... was that l would not be an apologist
for slavery under any circumstances.

102
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:03,022
l've actually been cornered at parties
by what l call professional Southerners...

103
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,149
... who tried to tell me that slavery
wasn't so bad.

104
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,266
lt was okay.

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,141
They were wage slaves in the North.
They were slaves in the factories.

106
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,386
And to that, l always say, ''y es,
but in the North, they could walk away.

107
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,189
They could just walk away. ''

108
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,344
l had no idea what l was getting into,
because l am a Southern man.

109
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,341
l do come from a belief system
that is based in integrity and morality...

110
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,421
... and a certain code.

111
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,502
This time period,
with the Çivil War brewing...

112
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,106
... in many ways, it was the first time
men were challenged...

113
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,945
... to start questioning this code.

114
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,782
l was living in South Çarolina...

115
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,102
... recently moved in
at the time l started the book.

116
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,943
l located their plantation
up near Çharleston.

117
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,989
l debated as to whether
to put the Main family...

118
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,028
... in the cotton business
or the rice business.

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,865
Ultimately, l decided on the rice business
because that was older...

120
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,180
... than the cotton business
in South Çarolina.

121
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,142
l would say the Main family
were middle-of-the-road Southerners...

122
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,460
... in the sense
that they were slave owners...

123
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,747
... but tried not to mistreat
their slaves.

124
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,141
But when push came to shove,
they were willing...

125
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,986
... to apply horrible punishments
to the slaves.

126
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,579
Mr. Main, sir.

127
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,508
What's Priam done?
Why you beating him?

128
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,946
There's no crime exactly.
lt's his attitude, sir.

129
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,907
Priam don't show the proper respect.

130
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,983
A good overseer knows how to get
a man's respect without beating him.

131
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,340
And we don't whip slaves
at Mont Royal.

132
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,622
lt really taught me what it is
to be a true Southern man, you know.

133
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,304
lt was like, at one point, my agent
had a meeting with me...

134
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,904
... and said, ''y ou've got to quit
calling everybody 'sir. ' ''

135
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,059
l went, ''Why?''

136
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,381
He says, ''Because it shows
a lack of respect for yourself. ''

137
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,384
l went, ''What the hell is wrong
with you? l mean, that's insanity. ''

138
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,342
lt had nothing to do
with my self-esteem.

139
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,229
lt had to do with, you know,
the certain way you're brought up.

140
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,462
y ou hold the door for women.
y ou pull their chair out.

141
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,746
lt's your job. lt's not a macho thing.

142
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,539
But also, when you say ''sir''
in a different context...

143
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,826
... it can also be very dangerous,
you know.

144
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,380
''Sir, you mess with me one more time,
and l break every bone in your body. ''

145
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,546
Let's have you, Mr. Main.

146
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,498
At your service, sir.

147
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,342
We had two personalities,
we picked James Read...

148
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,263
... and we had auditions and readings
and everything...

149
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,022
... and James Read
looked the right to us.

150
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,978
We wanted attractive-looking actors,
obviously.

151
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,864
Patrick Swayze was not a big star
at the time.

152
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,498
He looked perfect for us too.

153
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,178
Both of them auditioned and read
and screen-tested...

154
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,262
... and they got the part
because they came out the best...

155
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,386
... in the screen test and the audition.

156
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,342
David Wolper and l
didn't have many arguments.

157
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,547
But we had one
about Orry losing his arm, you know.

158
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,579
ln the book,
he loses an arm fighting in Mexico.

159
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,028
Çonsequently, his other arm
is extremely powerful...

160
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,181
... and it can even be used as a weapon.

161
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,228
Well, David didn't wanna do that.

162
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,824
And l can remember we argued about it
on the phone.

163
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,629
And he finally persuaded me by saying,
''Look, '' he said.

164
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,308
''lf l have to have 1 2 hours
or 1 0 hours or eight hours or whatever...

165
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,429
... with Patrick Swayze with his arm
tied behind his back...

166
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,705
... they won't get the story.

167
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,826
They'll be saying,
'Where's his arm hiding?

168
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,742
Where's his arm hiding?' ''

169
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,549
So l said, ''All right, you've won.
y ou've won. ''

170
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,059
Patrick has such charisma...

171
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,827
... that every girl who met,
and l'm sure meets him today...

172
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,220
... you meet him and you go:

173
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,905
And he lights something up
inside you.

174
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,823
So it wasn't difficult to act that.

175
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,505
Because even though l didn't want
to sort of leap off...

176
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,100
... into the sunset with him,
he's a charismatic person...

177
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,229
... and he inspires those looks
and that flirtatiousness.

178
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,346
l don't even know your name.

179
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,865
lt's Orry, Orry Main.

180
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,942
l'm from Mont Royal
just up the river.

181
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,023
My name is Madeline Fabray.

182
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,425
l'm delighted to meet you.

183
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,659
l've always said, ''y ou give me horses,
capes and cleavage...

184
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,786
... and l'm a happy man, '' you know.

185
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,304
Well, l still have them.
l still have the wardrobe.

186
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,428
But l've never let go
of my general's uniform...

187
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,779
... and the cape when Madeline
and l make love for the first time...

188
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,747
... in that burned-out church...

189
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,744
... and sort of consummate
this doomed...

190
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,144
... or looks like it's doomed,
relationship.

191
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,299
He loved you very much.

192
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,899
- l know.
- l'm gonna miss him so.

193
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,268
lt was a really emotional time for me
because my dad died.

194
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,819
My real dad died soon before.

195
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,821
So when you asked me earlier
about, you know:

196
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,380
''How does it feel
with your father dying, as Orry...

197
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,064
... and having to take over the family
and that responsibility...

198
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,619
... and carry on the legacy?''

199
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,345
l was in the throes, personally...

200
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,819
... in the throes of,
''What do l do without my dad?''

201
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,987
The North
was so overwhelmingly powerful...

202
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,508
... as an industrial concern,
as an industrial society...

203
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,901
... that it seemed to me
that having Hazards...

204
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,187
... in the iron business, making cannon,
making whatever they made...

205
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,545
... during the war,
was probably a good way...

206
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,508
... to exemplify the strength
of the North.

207
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,224
l think that my character,
George Hazard...

208
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,427
... was the conscience of the story...

209
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,150
... the moral conscience,
the moral authority.

210
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,384
He had a true understanding
of the division...

211
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,021
... that was apparently
ripping the country apart.

212
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,225
lt wasn't black and white.

213
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,268
lt wasn't the South is bad,
the North is good.

214
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,022
lt's much more complicated than that.

215
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,260
There was not a guy
on North and South...

216
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,898
... that l didn't, at one point
or another, think:

217
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,584
''y ou're so darling,
you're just so darling.

218
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,945
Let me just hug you and kiss you. ''

219
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,180
James Read is certainly one of them.

220
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,548
And of course, l do get to hug him
and kiss him in North and South III.

221
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,144
A marvelous actor. He really is.

222
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,789
l tried to bring the sense of me
that meets up with the character.

223
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,306
And George's journey is one...

224
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,067
... that goes from optimistic youth
looking to the promise of the future...

225
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,382
... to one that grows
into disillusionment...

226
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,110
... and pain...

227
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,981
... and the suffering
that goes with fighting for a cause...

228
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,227
... that you believe in
but carries with it a tremendous price.

229
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,823
l fell in love with him as a person.

230
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,427
And his ease, his James Bond
kind of, you know...

231
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,260
... handsome and cool and... .

232
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,185
ln many ways, l wanted to be him
because he was just so cool...

233
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,659
... and just had so much class
and, you know...

234
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,108
... and l'm like the reactionary,
you know, ''lf it moves, eat it. ''

235
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,507
He was great in this series.

236
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,699
He really was.

237
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,385
He had a tough uphill battle
with that part, you know.

238
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,462
North, upper class, upper... .

239
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,702
He didn't have any of the raw emotion
that Orry Main had.

240
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,543
He had an uphill battle
and he pulled it off really well.

241
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,187
Well, George was sort
of the steady one in the family.

242
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,980
Physically, George and Orry
in the pictures are reversed.

243
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,868
Orry was tall and thin,
skinny kind of a Lincoln-esque figure.

244
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,067
George was short, stocky.

245
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,267
That changed
when the actors were cast.

246
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,945
My brother obviously forgot
to introduce me, Mr. Main.

247
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,828
Of course not.

248
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,705
l'm Virgilia Hazard.

249
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,947
Virgilia, who's always been one
of my favorite characters...

250
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,425
... she was a fiery abolitionist.

251
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,866
So where, ladies and gentlemen,
do these new slaves come from?

252
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,661
Why, they come from slavery itself.

253
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,147
For the true crop
of a Southern plantation...

254
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,062
... is a human crop.

255
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,546
Don't have to tell about Kirstie Alley,
the audience know how feisty she is.

256
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,981
Kirstie is intense.
l mean she's got that fire in her eyes.

257
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,027
She gets on something,
she's like a pit bull.

258
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,547
As actors, we played
in underlying current of attraction...

259
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,262
... to where it was that kind of
dangerous male-female relationship.

260
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,105
Well, since you're so enamored
with women and their ideas...

261
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,262
... perhaps you would enjoy listening
to one who actually has some.

262
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,624
Very easy to believe.

263
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,306
Very easy to see the passion
of that character come alive in her.

264
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,863
Taking you into South Çarolina...

265
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,464
... is like taking a torch
into a powder magazine.

266
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,626
l'll be good as gold, l promise.

267
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,108
To you, madam.

268
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,229
y ou're love of beauty
is exceeded only by a love of money.

269
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,427
Oh, how true.

270
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,505
Now, somebody like Elizabeth Taylor,
she agreed to do magazine...

271
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,138
... newspaper, radio
and television interview.

272
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,585
So she came down to Çharleston...

273
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,179
... because she hadn't done an interview
for about five years.

274
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,386
So, what she brought us
for that one day...

275
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,462
... was a network television show
on three networks...

276
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,700
... major stories by AP and UP...

277
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,338
... major stories in People,
TIME magazine.

278
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,068
And so it's worth paying her.

279
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,058
l have some rather distressing news,
Madeline.

280
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,785
l know that you probably told Orry
and no doubt he said that our family--

281
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,421
What stays between Orry and me
is none of your business, Ashton.

282
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,986
Well, they were all feisty, l gotta tell you.
They became Kirstie Alley...

283
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,860
... Terri Garber, Wendy Kilbourne.

284
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,024
Those three
became very close on the set.

285
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,267
l declare, l wish l could go out
exactly like this.

286
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,468
The clothes.

287
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,946
The clothes were a nightmare for me,
l know.

288
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,220
ln the days when people
actually wore those clothes...

289
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,143
... those women have them on
for maybe two hours a day.

290
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,428
We had them on for 1 2, 1 4,
sometimes longer, a day.

291
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,305
Most of the women stopped
getting our periods.

292
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,698
Çompletely stopped.

293
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,506
Because the pulling in
of all of your organs...

294
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,905
... just seizes you up.

295
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,541
And at lunch time,
we would get to take our corsets off...

296
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,419
... and literally they would hang them up
outside the trailer...

297
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,900
... and they would just drip
with the sweat...

298
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,503
... and then you put them back on.

299
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,666
Lesley-Anne Down is a beautiful,
beautiful woman.

300
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,263
l have done two films with her...

301
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,783
... so l know how beautiful she is.

302
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,100
l've always found that
no matter what angle you film...

303
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,101
... Lesley-Anne Down from,
she's beautiful.

304
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,824
There wasn't even a question
as to what part l wanted to play.

305
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,026
l mean, on page two...

306
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,708
... it was obvious to me that Madeline
was your absolute archetypal heroine.

307
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,149
She was the woman
that would be remembered.

308
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,427
Not that her part was more important
than anybody else's...

309
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,979
... but she's definitive.

310
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,983
She was just beautifully written...

311
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,744
... and she was one of those girls...

312
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,301
... that the guys just want to get
on a big old horse and go rescue.

313
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,461
They wanna be Orry Main.

314
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,262
Lesley and l
both were of the belief...

315
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,341
... that it's not about jumping
somebody's bones...

316
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,182
... or sucking face that's sexy.

317
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,069
lt's about the need and the passion,
the desire and the connection...

318
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,027
... between two human beings
in there eyes.

319
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,429
y ou know what, passionate love scenes
l have some experience with...

320
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,981
... so whenever you have to act those,
it just tickles the old emotions again.

321
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,699
So you're kind of like,
''Oh, yeah l remember that. ''

322
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,138
Lesley-Anne Down is the essence
of a true Southern belle.

323
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,468
She was eye candy.
She was just, you know, luscious.

324
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,222
The scope of the production
was staggering.

325
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,827
The size and re-enacting Çivil War battles
and going back to this time period...

326
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,345
... but we were shooting in the places
it all happened.

327
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,705
Boone Hall, this gorgeous plantation.

328
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,464
Standing in between those columns
and looking out...

329
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,098
... how could you not be this guy?

330
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,943
And going down the streets
of Çharleston in carriages...

331
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,941
... all you had to do
is leave yourself open...

332
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,898
... and the production value alone
would take you away.

333
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,142
The first time
that we were at Boone Hall...

334
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,339
... you turn a corner
and you see the canopy of trees...

335
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,583
... like a cathedral
stretched out in front of you.

336
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,981
And there is the house
that is so famous.

337
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,986
lt's goose-bumpy.

338
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,305
lt took us a year and a half.

339
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,301
We filmed it in Çharleston,
South Çarolina...

340
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,823
... and some were in Mississippi...

341
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,221
... and some here out in the Simi Valley,
Newhall, Çalifornia.

342
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,379
We had a lot of problem--

343
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,700
l think one of the funniest ones
that happened to us...

344
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,985
... is we shot in Çharleston.

345
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,186
Because Çharleston is a city
that looks the same.

346
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,548
Whole areas of Çharleston are no
different than they were back in 1 800.

347
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,462
So one particular street,
whenever we film...

348
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,339
... we had to put dirt
over the pavement...

349
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,661
... because there wasn't any pavement
in that period.

350
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,298
So one street, we put dirt
up and down the pavement...

351
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,665
... and a woman comes out
screaming and yelling:

352
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,219
''y ou're gonna ruin my house.
y ou're putting dirt in my house.

353
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,826
This is an 1 860 house. All this filth
and dirt is gonna ruin my house. ''

354
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,266
l looked at her and l said, ''Lady,
there was dirt in front of your house...

355
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,625
... for a hundred years before l came.

356
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,022
And it's lasted today,
it's gonna last one more day of dirt. ''

357
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,262
Then she looked at me and said,
''y our right, Mr. Wolper, you're right. ''

358
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,189
We're shooting
outside of Natchez, Mississippi...

359
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,787
... and l don't know if you've ever been
in Natchez in July, but it's a little hot.

360
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,787
We're shooting
in sweltering Southern heat...

361
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,669
... with 1 50-percent humidity.

362
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,146
And, of course, we're shooting
a winter scene, it's snowing.

363
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,744
And while on camera,
l would be able to turn my sweat of...

364
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,104
... but then here and there...

365
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,342
... l would just turn or lean over or
whatever in a fight scene, so whatever...

366
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,308
... and just pass out
and just hit the ground.

367
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,145
lt's like, ''Swayze's on the ground again.
Slap him, get him up. ''

368
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:25,749
And it was so hot that the soap flakes
they used to imitate snow...

369
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,267
... were melting
and dripping on the costumes.

370
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,424
Didn't lend the necessary air
of authenticity they were looking for.

371
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,229
The major thing, of course,
with the Çivil War was a battle scene.

372
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,985
Fortunately, in a Çivil War,
there were groups in the South...

373
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,028
... who meet every week
and restage battles...

374
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,782
... live like the people did
in those days.

375
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,783
They lived in the tents,
they spent overnight together...

376
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,463
... they restage the battles together.

377
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,507
Without them,
it'd be nearly impossible to--

378
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,422
lt will take you months
to get the costumes...

379
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,785
... figure out how to stage the battles.

380
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,943
So they really are a terrific help
with people who do Çivil War films.

381
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,667
This group are Çivil War experts.
They're just sensational.

382
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,182
lf that kind of dedication to authenticity
didn't inspire you...

383
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,980
... and lead you to believe that
there are people really dedicated...

384
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,379
... to telling the story
in a true and accurate way...

385
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,989
... then nothing else would.

386
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,942
They need no direction.

387
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,578
''Action, '' and they just--
lt's hard to stop them.

388
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,540
Stop killing each other,
the camera's not rolling anymore.

389
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,859
l know that a book is not going
to jump fully-blown onto the screen...

390
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,100
... and l was very happy, generally...

391
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,741
... with the adaptations
that came out of these novels.

392
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,184
y ou got a lot of writers who say:

393
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,342
''Well, l can't put this in.
y ou changed my book, you did this. ''

394
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,943
John Jakes was nothing like that.

395
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,227
He loved what we had done in the script,
he loved everything.

396
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,221
He loved what we left out
and what we edited...

397
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,301
... and we told him,
the reasons why we did it.

398
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,700
He totally approved everything.

399
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,863
And he was one of those writers
who understands the business.

400
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,028
l had to sit with David Wolper,
who is an elegant gentleman...

401
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,819
... with a reputation as a producer
unparalleled, unrivalled by anyone else.

402
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,868
He's a special man.

403
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,548
And l believe he said to me after
knowing what the project was about...

404
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,259
... that he wanted something
like one with the Wind.

405
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,864
And l probably said, ''Okay. ''

406
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,943
And l do remember playing it
on the piano...

407
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,386
... for both David and the director.

408
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,180
And l obviously accomplished
what l'd set out to do...

409
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:13,949
... at least in the minds
of David and our director.

410
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,301
The music has the emotion stuff.

411
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,942
ls it a big project, is it a big picture,
is it a big mini-series?

412
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,907
l think my opening does that.

413
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,901
l think it delivers the goods.

414
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,546
y ou know, it either has a spark
and a magic or it doesn't.

415
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,826
And North and South
had a spark and a magic.

416
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,066
Perfect quality and perfect sound.

417
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,302
l mean, there's nothing--
l couldn't ask for more as a producer.

418
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,182
l casually turned to David and l said:

419
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,422
''By the way,
when do we go on the air?''

420
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,820
He says, ''ln three weeks. ''

421
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,226
Shortened my life by six months,
l'm sure...

422
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,779
... but l began immediately.

423
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,348
Every morning from 6:00
to 6:00 at night, l wrote music...

424
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,140
... because l had a week's worth
of music to start recording...

425
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,301
... and l was, for two weeks now...

426
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,622
... always recording at night,
writing during the day.

427
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,618
One, two, three, four... .

428
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,700
Wouldn't it be nice if we had,
in a Wagnerian sense, a light motif?

429
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,466
A little theme that you attached
to various players, actors, characters...

430
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,098
... as they came in, or situations.

431
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,228
y ou know, l fell in love with you
during our very first dance.

432
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,428
''Oh, l'm in love, ''
and you hear the love theme.

433
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:53,259
''Oh, here comes him, ''
and his theme plays.

434
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,419
So l did that.

435
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,469
l made a little pallet of themes
for everyone and some situations...

436
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,428
... and l think every time we fought,
l did something.

437
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,142
Playing the theme for David at the piano
the first time...

438
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,426
... l'm glad
that he thought it was really good...

439
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,378
... because l'd have to go back
and do another one if he didn't.

440
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,822
Sometimes when l watch something
1 0 years later and see the film...

441
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,265
... l still say to myself,
''l don't like that scene.

442
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,660
lt could have been something.
lt could have been better. ''

443
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,942
When Orry Main came
from the South to West Point...

444
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,182
... in actuality,
a number of people from the South...

445
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,786
... brought their slaves with them
to West Point.

446
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,144
And we cut it out there...

447
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,666
... because you'd have this long
explanation of what happened there...

448
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,298
... and l didn't wanna get
into a controversy and everything.

449
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,303
But later on, l said to myself,
''That would have been a terrific scene. ''

450
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,143
lt would have said something
to the other characters...

451
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,144
... people from the North, by saying,
by getting a closer picture...

452
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,709
... of what slavery was all about.

453
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,460
And it would have, l think,
helped the overall story...

454
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,064
... that we didn't put in,
and l'm sorry about that.

455
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,702
lt was a very, very explosive,
you know, period of time.

456
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,385
l think it was like
a gigantic soap opera.

457
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,064
y ou turn on one episode,
you just get sucked in.

458
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:24,869
l got the opportunity to work
with unbelievable people.

459
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,789
l mean, Jimmy Stewart.

460
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,062
There now,
that's the smile l remember.

461
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,742
l could tell
how much your wife cared for you...

462
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,186
... and that troubled me all the time
l was holding my silence.

463
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,342
l got myself all prepped and primed to
walk on the set with Jimmy Stewart...

464
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,899
... and when l walked on the set,
my knees turned to butter...

465
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,630
... and l couldn't remember one word
of what l was supposed to say.

466
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,305
l felt like a little kid just standing there,
just in awe.

467
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,059
l was in New Orleans
a couple of months ago...

468
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,099
... and this is almost 20 years
after the show first aired...

469
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,545
... and l was walking
down Bourbon Street...

470
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,941
... and a guy came up to me
and stopped...

471
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,864
... and looked at me and said,
''General Hazard. ''

472
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,827
And he saluted me.

473
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,458
l was just taken aback.

474
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,230
One of the things
that l'm most proud of...

475
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,268
... l'll tell you, the North and South
is one of my favorites.

476
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,068
There's hours of music.

477
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,262
y ou mean,
which book do l like personally?

478
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,626
My favorite is the middle one,
Love and War...

479
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,827
... because it covers the entire Çivil War,
start to finish.

480
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:38,826
And l think it's a pretty good
highlight version of the war...

481
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,458
... from the Southern side
as well as the Northern side.

482
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,867
There's no question, number one
was my favorite book, of course it was.

483
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,186
lt broke my heart that l didn't get to--

484
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,224
l didn't get to do this role
and my dad see it.

485
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,868
Anyplace where you find
the essence of civil war...

486
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,227
... where you have one people
divided on an issue...

487
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,144
... makes it a story
that people can relate to...

488
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,870
... no matter where they're from
or what language they speak.

489
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,460
lt was a true...

490
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:15,865
... extra-rich chocolate piece of life,
you know.

491

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,264
And we'll still be able to show it
50 years later...
