he was so big,

everybody laughed at him.

245
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,042

"I'm not going
to be fat anymore."

247
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:44,008
So, he exercised a lot
and lost weight.

248
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,761
Then he would post
his workout every day,

249

he was putting into it.

Each shot should have a story.

of that one.

00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,231
Just like Harry Prince, right?
When he traveled to Greece?

264
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,610

call me Shomar instead.

00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,804

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,717
If I pour May on Volcano's lava
on these people...

340
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,886
(LAUGHS)
it'll burn their nuts off.

341
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,555
(BOTH LAUGHING)

342
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,933
- What a waste!
- JOMAR: Mm-hmm.

343
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,060
- BERT: Director. Aica.
- What?

344
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,352
BERT: Tell me again
why we're doing this?

345
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,729
Is this some trip you're on?

346
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,731
I just think
that once and for all,

347
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,817
Asuang must be exposed,
you know.

348
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,944
People deserve to know
who he really is.

349
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,989
I mean, just like what we do
in our other documentaries.

350
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,701
But I think...
Asuang has changed.

351
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,410
- BERT: I think so, too.
- CHELSEA: Seems like it.

352
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,538
No, my point is...

353
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,999
He's already deceived
and manipulated you guys,

354
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,501
along with many other people.

355
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,254
But if you look closely,
you can see right through him.

356
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:37,092
BERT: So what happens
after you expose Asuang?

357
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:41,096
(SCOFFS) Why are you even
on my team, Bert? (CHUCKLES)

358
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,517
You're only after the awards,
you see.

359
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,604
Don't you want a sense of...

360
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,773
- Full... Full, push, pull...
- AICA: What?

361
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,443
- (CHUCKLES) Fulfillment!
- Exactly!

362
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,571
Sorry, my tongue itches
from the peanuts.

363
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,740
- Sense of fulfillment!
- BERT: Ma'am,

364
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,994
I want two orders
of <i>laing</i> with principles,

365
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,288
two orders of conscience...

366
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,874
and a glass of speed too.
Thank you!

367
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,250
JOMAR: Ma'am, do you have...

368
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,209
WOMAN: Wait,
I'm getting the <i>laing</i>!

369
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,587
Hey, we said it's for dine-in,
not to go.

370
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,670
(LAUGHS)

371
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,632
Gosh, you're fat
but you got no brain.

372
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,759
ASUANG: <i>Come in, guys!</i>

373
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,092
- AICA: Hi. Morning.
- Hi. Good morning!

374
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,054
Do you want breakfast?
I made pancakes.

375
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,179
Ah, no, thanks, we're good.

376
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,765
- Are you sure? Okay.
- It's okay. Yeah.

377
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,515
- Hey, put the buffet table...
- Roll it, Jomar.

378
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,518
In the center so the guests
see it as they come.

379
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,882
Are you... Are you getting this?

380
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,397
Did you feel the earthquake
last night? That was strong.

381
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,191
Yeah, and it's happening
more often.

382
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,693
Yes, because May on Volcano
is erupting anytime now.

383
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,237
So get ready,
there'll be lots of death.

384
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,159
So are you sure
you don't want pancakes?

385
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,370
- They're good.
- AICA: Are you serious?

386
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,455
Of course, they're good.
I made them myself.

387
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,664
- Two thumbs up.
- AICA: No, no, no. I mean...

388
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
about May on erupting soon.

389
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,795
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah, seriously.
Come on.

390
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,463
You mortals probably delayed it

391
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,946
by offering gifts
to my big brother,

392
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:02,803
but I don't think it would
still work this time.

393
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,305
You made him so angry.
But don't worry.

394
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,642
I think he's only going to kill
the bad people.

395
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,979
- (JOMAR SIGHING)
- But I'm not sure! (CHUCKLES)

396
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,564
What the fuck?

397
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,151
- ASUANG: Uh, guys!
- AICA: Just a second.

398
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,196
Uh... (COUGHS)
So how's the foods coming along?

399
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,950
(CHUCKLES) It's just fine.
Four more dishes to go.

400
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,119
We're making the dessert later.

401
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,164
- There. She's Nilda, my friend.
- (GIGGLES)

402
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,251
Come on, Asuang,
it's embarrassing.

403
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,836
I'm so disheveled.

404
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,963
You're always disheveled.
(LAUGHS)

405
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,675
- Oh, you! (LAUGHS)
- Now that Nilda has retired,

406
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,761
uh, she's now just
a regular housewife.

407
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,889
That's it. She cooks...
There she goes.

408
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,225
Make sure
that's delicious, Nilda!

409
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,019
Of course! (CHUCKLES)

410
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,104
Nilda is a great cook!

411
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,191
Hey! What's the matter with you?

412
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,735
Don't throw it away, wash it!

413
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,403
There's more over here.

414
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,322
ASUANG:
<i>The food has to be special</i>

415
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,785
<i>because we have a lot
of important guests coming.</i>

416
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,310
NILDA: I don't think
we have enough.

417
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,081
GIRL: Are we done?

418
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,415
NILDA: Of course, we're not done!

419
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,878
We have four dishes to go!
Hurry up!

420
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,005
Move back some more.
Your belly is in the way.

421
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,467
There. See?

422
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,470
ATM. I'm posting this later.

423
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,431
(GROANS) This is all burnt.

424
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,475
No, it's not.

425
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,018
It smells just like
your armpits.

426
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:38,231
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Go ahead. I'll get this done.

427
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,443
Hey, where is the chicken?

428
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,862
- (FAINT MUSIC PLAYING)
- Hey, KitKat!

429
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,197
Give us a wave!

430
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,700
(CHUCKLES) What a snob.

431
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,746
KitKat is a longtime friend.
Uh, she's an <i>aswang.</i>

432
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,706
Uh, I'm sure you see her around.

433
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,334
Uh, the other day
she was a wild boar.

434
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,794
Sometimes she's a goat.

435
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,587
It depends on her mood.

436
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,047
But let me clear this up.

437
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,342
We're not related.
I'm not related to <i>aswangs.</i>

438
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:10,889
Our names just sound the same.
It's like "vlog" and "blog".

439
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,891
Their <i>aswang</i> is
spelled with a W.

440
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,269
Mine is with a U.

441
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:21,525
Uh, sometimes
I live with <i>aswangs.</i>

442
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,443
And... that's how I learned

443
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,071
that their culture
is really misunderstood.

444
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:31,034
The movies showed different
images of them,

445
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,662
so people don't look at them
in a positive way.

446
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,831
My brother don't like them too,

447
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,209
because they eat people.

448
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,255
So a lot of them died
and some are in hiding.

449
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,257
AICA: Chelsea! Chelsea!
Move away!

450
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,967
Ew!

451
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,092
- What are you doing?
- AICA: There's a cockroach.

452
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,138
- Don't!
- AICA: Why not?

453
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,433
- It's not doing anything to you.
- AICA: But it's flying.

454
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,187
When it lands on you,
you can decide what to do.

455
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,400
Can you move back? (CHUCKLES)
You're too close.

456
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,235
Oh, boss? What is it?

457
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,113
It's the roast chickens
you ordered.

458
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,407
- What's that?
- The roast chickens?

459
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,076
- All those?
- MAN: Yes, sir.

460
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,996
There's more downstairs,
you got freebies.

461
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,042
(CHUCKLES) Okay. Uh...
No, it's okay.

462
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,254
Uh, KitKat? KitKat?

463
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,965
- KitKat.
- What is it?

464
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:33,263
- You ordered roast chickens?
- You said to order <i>lechon.</i>

465
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,100
Uh, can we cut first?

466
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,227
- Sure.
- We're done, right?

467
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,688
Let's take a break, okay?

468
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,567
Uh, everyone relax.
You want a drink, director?

469
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,069
Have some drinks first.
Come here.

470
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,199
When I told you to buy <i>lechon,</i>
I meant pork. A roasted pig.

471
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,950
Why did you buy roast chicken?

472
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:59,372
But you didn't say
what kind to get.

473
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,333
When I say <i>lechon,</i>

474
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,420
it means roasted pig.
Why did you buy roast chicken?

475
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,088
And 20,000 pesos worth?

476
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,508
But that's still <i>lechon.</i>

477
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,302
That's not fit for a feast.

478
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,512
You buy that when you don't
have food at home.

479
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,556
Okay, maybe even
for a graduation party.

480
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,266
But this is my party!

481
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,018
Harry Prince is coming,

482
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,393
and you'll serve him
roast chicken?

483
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,814
- I can't send it back.
- Shh! Shh.

484
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,483
Stop explaining.

485
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,778
Get in there, make it look
like a roast pig,

486
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,321
I don't care how you do it.

487
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,783
Just do it, or I'll roast you.

488
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,910
Hmm? All right, go on.

489
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,954
- Oh, she'll show you the way.
- Okay.

490
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,791
Okay? Thank you!
Thank you, sir.

491
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,043
That's a lot of chicken!
(CHUCKLES)

492
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,127
(SIGHS)

493
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,004
Sometimes it's, uh...
(CHUCKLES)

494
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:54,052
It's really difficult
to delegate responsibilities.

495
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:58,056
You know, you have all these
things going on. You're busy.

496
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,556
(TONGUE CLICKS)
Well, you have no choice.

497
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,727
You have to let other people
do these things.

498
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,565
Sometimes, you give
the simplest instructions,

499
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,151
and they just don't get it.
You know what I'm saying?

500
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,280
(TONGUE CLICKS) It makes you
wanna... (CHUCKLES)

501
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,491
(LAUGHS)

502
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,787
- KAPITANA: Asuang!
- I love exotic... Who's that?

503
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,958
Oh, the bar an gay captain!
Just a sec, director.

504

It's nice to see you.

00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,048
I want to eliminate dengue!

1017
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,968
Ekis, I want to know
the real reason.

1018
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,348
I want my life to have meaning,
Asuang!

1019
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,600
The truth.

1020
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,896
I want... I want to make money.
That too.

1021
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,606
You said...

1022
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,982
in your message something about
a million. Is that still a go?

1023
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:02,983
Yes, it is.

1024
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,571
So there. And the mission.
I am a priest after all.

1025
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,239
And I'm not busy right now.

1026
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,869
What's even better,
I brought my brother with me.

(TONGUE CLICKS)

1028
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,919
Big brother,
what kind of trip is this?

1029
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,671
This, my brother, is a miracle.

1030
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,049
I'm sorry for not visiting
you lately.

1031
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,302
I've been too busy
serving the god Gugurang.

1032
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,598
Hey, hey, hey, baby shark!

1033
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,851
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- (CHUCKLES)

1034
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,854
Don't look at me like that,
my gosh.

1035

1036
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,775

How are you, Ompong?

1039
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,243
- Asuang?
- Yes.

1040
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,620
What are you doing with Asuang?
What are you up to?

1041
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,496

1042
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,540
Damn, is this some kind
of networking?

1043
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,500
Hold on. He's taking us
on a mission

1044
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,460
where our holiness
will match Gugurang's!

1045
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,295
We need your help.

I no longer go for such trouble.
Not anymore. I pass.

Look at me!
I'm an action star now!

1050
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,351
- You're an action star now?
- Yes!

1051

- Like FPJ?
- (LAUGHS) Yes, exactly!

1066
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:04,480
Can you... let me join you?

(LAUGHS)

Okay, guys, here's the catch.

1070
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,117
No one can touch
the Sacred Fire.

1071
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,452
Only Gugurang can.

1072
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,748
Well, even he has to endure it.

1073
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,792
- Interesting, huh?
- How?

1074
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:25,919
Ask me how.

This is where I put
the Sacred Fire.

1076
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:32,592
This is what I used to steal it.

1077
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:37,555
This time... Oh, yeah.
I, Ash-ang...

1078
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,935
Ash-ang will emerge victorious!

1079
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,188
Yeah, I can feel it.

1080
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,524
Let's go, guys. Come on!

1081
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,818
Uh, Bert,

1082
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:54,572
can you do... video montage?

1083
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,700
Just shoot
from different angles,

1084
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,329
then we'll drop some nice music
during the edit.

1085
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:05,875
Something organic, right?
Keep the vibe light.

1086
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,088
Can you see this, Mike?
Now, here's the problem.

1087
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,507
May on Volcano is going
to erupt any time now.

1088
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,761
It really is, okay.
Now, this is where we go.

1089
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:21,140
There's a lot of high,
coarse grass there.

1090
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,059
But don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1091
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,185
I know the way.

1092
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,103
BERT: So, this is the way.

1093
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,506

1094
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,818

00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,278
CHELSEA: We're all set.

1096
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:37,448
This is the sin meter.
I stole it from Sit an.

1097
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:41,619
He's the Tagalog counterpart
of the God of the Underworld.

1098
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:45,123
He uses this to tell him
if someone goes up to heaven

1099
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,874
or down to hell.

1100
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,710
It's not on the level, though.

1101
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,503
Commit a sin for me, Ompong.

1102
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:53,131
OMPONG: Is it a sin to love?
I heart you.

1103
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,716
Here's a sin. Here you go.

1104
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,009
- Is it level now?
- Sweet!

1105
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,595
Gugurang has killed almost
every criminal in the world.

1106
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,473
It's going to be tough
to find sin anywhere!

1107
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,309
My lord Gugurang,

1108
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,228
I do not condone
the sins of my brother.

1109
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,355
Forgive my ears
for hearing his words!

1110
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,898
OMPONG: It's your fault!

1111
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,062
Will you kill someone already
to get the meter right?

1112
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,694
Stop that, Ekis!

1113
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,823
Do it right.

1114
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,906
Who are you?

1115
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:24,579
My name is Miguel.
I was sent by Adelaida.

1116
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,957
I know this guy. It is him!

1117
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,085
He's the one who stole
the gods' bracelets!

1118
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,340
Hey, director!
The meter's level now!

1119
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,178
I'm happy with this team.

1120
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,389
It's a good team.
We have a good bond.

1121
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,268
I'm not sure
about Miguel, though.

1122
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,020
I know his clan.

1123
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,898
We have a history,
but I won't share that with you.

1124
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:56,611
You know, being a good thief
runs in the blood.

1125
01:00:56,694 --> 01:01:00,448
Listen up, guys!
The mission is simple.

1126
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,075
We will go up May on Volcano

1127
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:06,204
and search for the passageway
that leads to Gugurang's home.

1128
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,999
The only challenge
is Gugurang's hired men.

1129
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,919
Remember that area
with the huge boulder?

1130
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,046
It's hard to forget.

1131
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,631
There are crows there.

1132
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:22,011
Huge crows. Really black crows.

1133
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:28,768
Now these crows can smell
an approaching evil entity.

1134
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:33,189
(MIMICKING CROW)

1135
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,610
The only way to distract them

1136
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,488
is for us to bring
a lot of maggots.

1137
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,908
We will scatter
the maggots around

1138
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:48,913
and the crows will get
distracted by eating them.

1139
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,457
Then they won't smell me.

1140
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,793
Then we can pass.

1141
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,504
You wanna see the whole thing?

1142
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,882
You can see, right? Here, look.
To get a better look.

1143
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,759

I've known Ekis
since he was a kid.

His loud mouth always got us
in trouble with the police.

1149

Go on, show them your moves!
How?

1150
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,411
But Ekis is really talented.

1151
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,204
I have no idea
how he ended up that way.

1152
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,415
Must be something he ate.

1153
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,628
AICA: So, how do you feel?

1154
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:42,425
Uh, right now?
I'm excited, of course.

1155
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:47,513
But... a bit nervous, you know.
Because this is it, right?

In the words of the great
Harry Prince on his Instagram...

Is it true that
you've been scared of fire

ever since Gugurang
punished you?
