Translation: R1y!

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
1000 to 1

3
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,627
Based on a true story

4
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:26,129
What are the odds?
Our life is a part of a big puzzle?

5
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,057
Is everybody a little bit waiting
until someone makes us a whole?

6
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:38,058
Is life a series of
coincidences or is there more?

7
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,171
Hey, Cory.

8
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,120
You'd better quieter
doing, big guy.

9
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,502
You're breathing pretty heavy,
you get older and older.

10
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:50,997
- I'll show you even old. Come on.
- I'll make it this time easier.

11
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:54,893
- That was no mistake.
- Stop block.

12
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:57,492
Blocks? No, it was not a mistake.

13
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,656
every game you call it.

14
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:04,420
You know what blocks?
Each turnovers call you wrong game.

15
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,421
So what, you do not understand.

16
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,410
- My game! Again?
- No. I have to learn.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Learning takes place here.
-I Have to learn.

18
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,935
- Teacher present?
- Exactly, I see you.

19
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:29,533
Coach.
-Pops.

20
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:33,863
Hey, Coach.
Hey.

21
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:37,976
Beautiful, Weissman! Relax,
loose shoulders.

22
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:42,090
Once throw?

23
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:45,091
It's all in the knees.

24
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:51,183
What can I say?
those who can not go to the coach.

25
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:56,163
You're doing good boy. Good shot
and defense over the floor.

26
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,164
I disagree with you will not play
I say you do not observe.

27
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,800
There are three guests who will be graduating this year.
If you go

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
as you play now you have chance next
season start as <i> point guard </ i>.

29
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,669
Coach, I do not want anything
I've earned yourself.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,500
You have a thousand points in your school career.
I think you've earned it all.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Bend your knees.

32
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:43,143
- How is he, David?
- Cory, good to see you.

33
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:46,144
- I've heard you do great things.
- I try anyway.

34
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:59,597
Two pieces Margherita
the sweetest girl in the school.

35
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:02,627
Thank you, Cory. Very kind.
You walked through that whole party,

36
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:06,741
- For me, you're the best boyfriend ever.
- Sorry. I'm just...

37
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:09,339
... Nervous for the presentation.

38
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,020
Fate or free will?
"Romeo and Juliet".

39
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:17,783
Seven to nine pages Monday
and I can not even get around.

40
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,247
If you have ideas ...

41
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:28,824
- Romeo is the man, right?
- Cute.

42
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:36,185
Maybe this
situation both ways.

43
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,217
As this year's team, with me.

44
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:43,113
- You know I'm a competitive person?
- A little.

45
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:49,825
That final year student, on my
start position. He's really good.

46
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:53,722
That is to say, that I for the first time
in my life, sitting on the couch.

47
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:58,917
I can through this fateful
event in the pit to sit down,

48
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,516
if I can use this motivation
to just work harder.

49
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:06,367
I know nothing about Romeo and Juliet,
but what I do know is ...

50
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:12,124
that's the way how you respond to something
is as important as what happens to you.

51
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:18,186
Wow. Cory which was
actually very helpful.

52
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:21,187
Thank you.

53
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,846
That was sweet.

54
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:32,258
- My turn. I'm looking for more.
- Sorry.

55
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,259
- No, it's nothing.
- With extra cheese? Or pepperoni.

56
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,289
The idea of ​​an expanding universe
gives you the idea

57
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,403
that galaxies farther out
each float in space.

58
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:04,301
However, now it is believed that the
galaxies do not move

59
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:08,414
But that space there between
is increasing.

60
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:13,177
I see the facial expressions that
some of you are confused completely.

61
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:18,178
Our time is over. Do not be
worried, Thursday becomes clear.

62
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:56,044
Good. Good.

63
00:07:56,045 --> 00:08:00,590
Good. Come on.

64
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:06,734
Do you want your tutu now or later? Lifting!

65
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:12,064
You would have me in a skirt
want to see is not.

66
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:14,665
- Good job.
- Thank you.

67
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,694
What's next?

68
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:22,890
You and Ally have plans?
We thought to go to Kristin tonight.

69
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:28,518
Perhaps following some bench press.

70
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,931
What do you think?

71
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,529
- Of what?
- From tonight, crazy.

72
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,910
Sorry. I think I
was daydreaming.

73
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,508
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

74
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:46,055
- Sure.
- I'm starting this afternoon, headache.

75
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:51,056
- Why do you ask Kathy not an aspirin.
- No it's OK.

76
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,807
- Hey, I think this weight is taped.
- What?

77
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:07,055
This weight seems stuck stuck.

78
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,155
What are you talking about?

79
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:17,434
You do not look so good, dude.

80
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:22,097
It's like someone me
with knives sticking in my head.

81
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:30,870
We're going to get some water.

82
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:35,222
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah, it's good, I ...

83
00:09:52,521 --> 00:10:00,097
- What's wrong with me, Pops?
- I do not know. Let's go to Katie.

84
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:02,912
Lean on Me.

85
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:05,726
I got you.

86
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:09,840
We are almost there.
Coach! Katie!

87
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,520
- What happened?
- I do not know. We were on the train.

88
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:18,284
Put him on the bench.
Cory, can you tell me what's wrong?

89
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,314
Head hurts.

90
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:26,943
Can you squeeze my hand, Cory?

91
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:29,975
Okay now again
try it with your left hand.

92
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:35,387
Can you laugh at me?

93
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:42,747
- Oh my.
- Stay down. Everything will be fine.

94
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:45,779
This is from George Petrie
Gettysburg College.

95
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,026
We have an ambulance
required at the gym.

96
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:52,274
- I think a student has a stroke.
- What?

97
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:55,738
- His name is Cory Weissman.
- Can you tell me what day it is?

98
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,336
The left side does not respond.

99
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:11,563
- It's good, right?
- You did well.

100
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:21,338
What about his parents?

101
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:31,027
Bye dear. I'm jogging
and at half past five I have a client.

102
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:34,275
Mrs. Weissman, Brendan here.

103
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,776
Hey, Pops. Where is Cory?

104
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:41,688
Is everything okay?

105
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:50,533
We where the weightlifting
in the gym and ...

106
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,801
Hi, Mrs. Weissmann, Katie Whaley here.
I'm assistant sports coach at Gettysburg.

107
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:09,802
We do not know with certainty. But it looks
forward Cory had a stroke.

108
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:16,276
Where is he?

109
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,277
The ambulance just left
Hershey to the hospital.

110
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,638
FIRST AID

111
00:12:31,865 --> 00:12:35,065
- Thank you for coming coach.
- What's going on, we see him?

112
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:39,165
He's room 206.
I'll get the doctor.

113
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:57,081
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

114
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:04,525
Sorry.

115
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:18,194
It is subarachnoid hematoma caused by
an arterio-venous malformation in Cory's brains.

116
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:21,225
AVM, which is torn.

117
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,390
We have a medical background.

118
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:29,669
The large amount of blood from
the bleeding is the cause of the stroke.

119
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,050
And unfortunately this is still bleeding.

120
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:35,947
And you can not stop what
means that the brains are swollen.

121
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,194
We can not do anything until the
is stabilized by itself.

122
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:43,308
And if it does not by itself
stabilizes, then what?

123
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,339
The good news is that he is young
and has an excellent condition.

124
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,700
That's exactly what I tell my patients,
if their children have problems.

125
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:56,701
You have to be honest.

126
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:02,331
at present we can not
be sure that he survives the night.

127
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:36,350
Hey.
Hey.

128
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,351
- What time is it?
- It is late.

129
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,980
They have prepared a room,
where we can get some sleep.

130
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,805
He is in good hands.

131
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:58,433
I can see that he fights,
but he can not do this alone.

132
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:00,434
He needs us.

133
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:06,228
All I have to sit here 24 hours a day
and a whole week of sleep.

134
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:09,229
I am here when he wakes up.

135
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:18,806
Whatever happens, we stand
not allow this beats Cory.

136
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,383
What the...?

137
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,847
Come on!

138
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,811
What is happening?

139
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,238
Causing bleeding
more pressure on the brains.

140
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:38,269
- We should give Mannitol.
- What is Mannitol?

141
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,867
If he does not stabilize
we have to operate on him.

142
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:45,197
- What about swelling?
- Sorry, you'll have to wait outside.

143
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,698
Let's go. Give them some space
to work. Come on.

144
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:05,569
We do not operate. The danger
is not over, but the situation is better.

145
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:20,024
Cory. Can you hear me?

146
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:27,847
Vital signs look good.
We just have to wait and see.

147
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:30,043
We just have to wait and see.

148
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,044
Can you tell us where you are?

149
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:56,641
Hey, boy.
Hey.

150
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,890
- Another change?
- He's still unconscious.

151
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:01,891
Still no response.

152
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,235
Hey, big brother here.

153
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,014
What's up, dude?

154
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,757
Where have you been?

155
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:29,152
I brought lunch for Mom and Dad.

156
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:34,932
Do you have a chocolate milkshake
bring me?

157
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:49,901
- What day is it?
- Monday.

158
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,902
- What is the name of your brother?
- Jeremy.

159
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:57,911
Where are you going to study?

160
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,912
Harvard.

161
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,241
Stanford.

162
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:07,922
Gettysburg?

163
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,551
The whole team has
Signatures put.

164
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:15,231
Pops and Coach
have brought it.

165
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,911
You're in luck, so much
have friends who care about you.

166
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,726
Do I really have to such rehabilitation?

167
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,108
You have to go a long way, boy.

168
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:29,109
- Can not I just practice at home?
- It's only a month, more or less.

169
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:32,984
Depends on how fast you recovered.

170
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:38,613
Can you call the nurse for me?

171
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:42,510
Oh ... I'll do it.

172
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,407
- What do you mean?
- I'll help.

173
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:51,386
I helped grandpa always.
Shift your weight. To the left.

174
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:55,283
- To the left?
- The other left.

175
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:59,614
- Sure, what you do?
- I've got it. Let me...

176
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,995
Sorry. Are you okay?

177
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:05,207
You let me fall
the side that feels pain.

178
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
- What happened?
- Way to treat a stroke patient is not, anyway.

179
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,300
Yep.

180
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
Thank you.

181
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,813
What a fun.

182
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,867
How are you? Does it hurt?

183
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:49,347
From time to time. Sometimes it seems like I
a half-dead body dragging.

184
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:02,614
Not ... not look at me.

185
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:06,377
- What?
- As if you feel sorry for me.

186
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
- I feel sorry for you.
- Yes, but I'm going to beat this.

187
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,500
Clear? Come here.

188
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:33,794
That felt good.
At the right.

189
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:40,422
North Wright is one of the best
rehabilitation of the country.

190
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:44,182
We have advanced treatment methods,
care of patients with spinal cord injuries,

191
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:46,383
head injuries and strokes.

192
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,873
In the beginning, it's all what
overwhelming but you get used to it quickly.

193
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:58,874
Let's take a look at your room.

194
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:03,667
We make you wake up at 7:00 for breakfast.

195
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:06,915
Then you have six times a day therapy.

196
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,162
- So we start tomorrow?
- What do you mean "we"?

197
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:13,409
- I studied physiotherapy.
- Maybe, but ...

198
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,657
With all due respect, he might
your patient, but he is my son.

199
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:21,204
I motivated him 19 years
am not going to stop now.

200
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,666
- By speaking no sense.
- Yes, believe us.

201
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:29,431
This is a good center.
They will help us to overcome this.

202
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,932
I'm exhausted.

203
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and I have some appointments in the morning, so ...

204
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,029
I'll be. There is still the
some things that I want to read.

205
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,090
Mother Bear.

206
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,047
Okay. I'm leaving early in the morning.
I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

207
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:48,152
I love you.
Do not stay up late.

208
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:33,514
- Come here. Show Dad how.
- Okay, one more time.

209
00:22:33,515 --> 00:22:37,710
Good. Go to the Basket.
Shoot!

210
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:40,824
- Scorer!
- Yes, Cory!

211
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:51,050
Hands wide.
Nice attitude, Cory.

212
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:54,731
Good. Block me.

213
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:57,329
- In your face.
- Yes, son.

214
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,958
That's my boy.

215
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,139
Push and pull back.

216
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,171
Pushing. Good.

217
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:11,172
You use your right arm,
but teaches the left arm.

218
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:21,810
This is the hardest,
thing I ever had to do.

219
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:25,707
Just like my brains and body
speak two different languages.

220
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,522
Good.

221
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:32,023
I have to learn everything all over again.

222
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:51,791
The hardest thing is my mind
clearly keeping all those medications.

223
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:57,316
Shift your weight
to your left foot.

224
00:23:57,317 --> 00:24:00,917
But I will do everything required,
to play basketball again.

225
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,978
Although it sometimes seems
still going to last very long.

226
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:27,975
That's math for kindergarten.

227
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:29,976
Can you solve it?

228
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:37,934
This is just crazy.

229
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:42,435
- Maybe if you try to concentrate ...
- Maybe you should just do it.

230
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:48,996
Sorry.

231
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,574
I will do it.
It works well, thank you.

232
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:10,812
I hate it that you have to see me like this.

233
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:12,766
Cory

234
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:17,791
- I do not care.
- I do not even know what I'm doing here.

235
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:26,012
I do not believe in coincidence.
Everything happens for a reason.

236
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:32,574
What is the reason for that?

237
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:38,787
It just happened.
There is no reason.

238
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:43,282
You just ... bad luck.

239
00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:47,483
Weight on the left.

240
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:54,012
Continue, continue to the end.

241
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:59,021
- Come on, you can do this.
- I do my best, Mom.

242
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:02,022
Only sometimes seems all this ...

243
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:06,002
I need a break.

244
00:26:31,713 --> 00:26:35,393
Are you all right, Cory?
What is going on?

245
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,156
To the left, come on, put pressure.

246
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:44,053
Upright. And right.

247
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:46,868
- How are you?
- Well okay,

248
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,898
but I think we
against a wall walk.

249
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:52,245
Okay, in the wheelchair,
we go outside.

250
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:56,846
- What do you mean?
- Time for a little alternative therapy.

251
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:03,942
Mom, what are you doing?
This is stupid.

252
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,685
Since you could crawl want
you throw a basketball.

253
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:09,717
I do not want to throw,
because I can not.

254
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,964
- You do not know.
- Look, I really appreciate this.

255
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:16,212
But, you can take me back to
bring the hospital?

256
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:19,242
I never doubt your mother.

257
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:22,221
If you make it you get
me a chocolate milkshake.

258
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:27,501
I'm here now anyway.

259
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:32,502
Let's try it.

260
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:41,594
- Do you have him?
- Yes.

261
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,977
You can do it.

262
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:14,780
- He's still there.
- Double or nothing?

263
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:22,676
- Good shot.
- Camera running?

264
00:28:22,677 --> 00:28:26,306
Let's see how you do it,
when someone stands in the way.

265
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:32,307
- Beautiful.
- Aim and follow.

266
00:28:32,637 --> 00:28:34,317
Bend your knees.

267
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:37,318
- There right.
- All right!

268
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:41,514
- This is therapy.

269
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:53,673
Get that kid away from me.
He is a zombie.

270
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:59,317
Where are you going?

271
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:02,513
- Quickly before returning Sarah.
- Oh my God.

272
00:29:02,514 --> 00:29:05,014
Let's go to the cafeteria or so.

273
00:29:10,307 --> 00:29:12,307
I believe that he himself
feeling better.

274
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:15,428
- This is amazing.
- Is that so?

275
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:21,131
Yes, look at the tension of that muscle.
Really good, Cory.

276
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:24,832
- It comes back, unbelievable.
- It's the wrong foot.

277
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:30,225
I am healed.
Look, everything works again!

278
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,226
Turn the camera but out.

279
00:29:53,391 --> 00:30:00,391
I need brain surgery again
to completely remove the AVM.

280
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:05,730
But every time I turn
self-pity starting to get

281
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:09,642
I think of all those people who
have affected much worse.

282
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:17,143
Maybe I should not be so much
myself and think more of them.

283
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:25,215
Hello. Is this seat taken?

284
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:28,030
Please.

285
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:31,060
So if you like chess?

286
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:35,061
Yes, it is not Backgammon, but ...

287
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:41,669
- I'm Cory.
- Ed Welch.

288
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,349
Nice to meet you, Ed.

289
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,978
- Why do not you start.
- Charity?

290
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,392
Why are you here?

291
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,558
I had a stroke.

292
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,971
- At your age? Is that legal?
- I do not think so.

293
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:04,218
It happened during basketball practice.

294
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,383
Completely unexpected.

295
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:12,228
I also once played basketball,
When the pants were still short.

296
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:18,229
- I played <i> guard </ i>.
- I also, at Gettysburg College.

297
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:28,032
Who's turn is it?

298
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:31,497
- I can not remember.
- Me neither.

299
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:35,126
Brain damage is
life interesting.

300
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,940
Indeed.

301
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,754
This time you have to concentrate, Ed.

302
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:45,033
You start this time but.

303
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:52,714
After the surgery, I go five
times as hard to do my best.

304
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:57,043
I'm going to work to 500
shots to throw every day.

305
00:31:57,044 --> 00:32:00,157
I know that.
No doubt about it.

306
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:03,158
Well, I ...

307
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:08,540
I'll see you when I wake up.

308
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:23,494
- I love you.
- I love you.

309
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:41,959
Please.
One medium citizen.

310
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,052
- Thank you, Mr. Weissman.
- There is more though.

311
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,733
- You have a rap name required by the headscarf.
- Cory's AVM.

312
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:57,114
What happens now?

313
00:32:57,115 --> 00:33:01,010
This summer therapy
and then back to school.

314
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:04,908
And then I do my best to
to get back into the team.

315
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,505
The doctor said
is that really possible?

316
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:11,052
She did not say
that it would not be possible.

317
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:15,083
Besides, I get a special permit,
if I'm released from the hospital.

318
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:19,084
- With a disabled parking permit.
- Beautiful. Free parking.

319
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:29,588
- What is that?
- Amy Powers keeps her birthday in the new tent.

320
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:33,269
- sounds fun. Do you want to go?
- No I can not.

321
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,670
- You go.
- Okay.

322
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:41,866
Just go.
It sounds nice.

323
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:47,412
No do not bother.
Let's get some food.

324
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:50,574
Okay.

325
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:10,074
What are you looking at?

326
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:12,456
Is this really what you do all day?

327
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:16,457
Eating, sleeping and waiting
until someone comes home?

328
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:22,414
Is that all?

329
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:26,528
No secret things dogs
are up to when nobody is looking?

330
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:29,775
Guide your spy agency?

331
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,776
You slip into the liquor cabinet
when nobody is looking?

332
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:37,107
I feel that you can talk to.

333
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:42,982
So if you're not rehabilitating,
you hang around here all day?

334
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:46,662
You make it sound boring.
I mean, the mail comes,

335
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:49,044
Sometimes, the phone rings.

336
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:54,673
And when are you going to
Decreasing use drugs?

337
00:34:54,674 --> 00:35:00,734
And then no more legal parties?
No, they can not do.

338
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:03,735
At least not yet.

339
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:10,261
-Who is it?
-Kylie.

340
00:35:10,262 --> 00:35:16,189
- They get together for a volleyball tournament.
- Beautiful.

341
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,302
It seems fun.

342
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:24,803
- Can you come?
- No.

343
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,962
I can not go.
I need to rest.

344
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,559
I will not leave you here.

345
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,757
It does not matter.
I still need some time

346
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:41,036
to my baseball cards
alphabetical order to explain.

347
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:43,437
What, huh?

348
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:46,253
I'm kidding.

349
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,298
What is it?

350
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:57,890
I am so sorry.

351
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:59,991
I do not like someone.

352
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:04,005
What kind of person?

353
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:08,565
Someone who can not handle this.

354
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:12,395
Someone who is so selfish
and only thinks

355
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:16,608
how difficult it is to
To have a friend with a disability.

356
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,004
I wanna be the one
which is on your side

357
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:26,468
in prosperity and adversity
waiting for you.

358
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:30,469
By anyone who
admires for her sacrifice.

359
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:34,098
But I'm not.

360
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:41,407
As much as I would like it to be,
it's not me.

361
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,408
And thus...?

362
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:51,435
Get it?

363
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:56,527
Is that what you mean?

364
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:00,857
Who should I be?

365
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:08,918
The one who says, sure,
it does not matter?

366
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:16,019
- No.
- Do you have any idea what I've been through?

367
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,880
- I have not done anything to deserve this.
- I know.

368
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:26,553
I have to fight for everything.
Fighting for my strength.

369
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:33,254
Fighting for my memory,
Fighting for basketball.

370
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:40,259
And I'm going to win.
I'm going to win!

371
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,530
But my girlfriend can not even
few months to wait until I'm better.

372
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:50,270
Can not wait that long.
Is that fair?

373
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:53,466
That's not it.

374
00:37:55,467 --> 00:38:00,900
And this does not deserve you.
I am so sorry.

375
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:52,437
Ha, dude.

376
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:59,550
- Is everything OK?
- I have to do this driving test.

377
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:03,447
- Sure, if the therapist gives permission.
- Actually, now.

378
00:39:03,448 --> 00:39:08,073
If I were here longer alone
I'm in this house is crazy.

379
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:16,220
Slightly slower, ink
your license is still wet.

380
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:20,550
- You may 45 here, I drive 35.
- Do me a favor.

381
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:24,880
Remember how grandma drove slowly?
We were crazy.

382
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:30,726
You're doing the same.
I've actually been thinking a lot grandmother.

383
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:33,540
It was two years ago
and I still miss her every day.

384
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:39,169
I always wonder
if she's out there somewhere outside,

385
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,282
watches over us or anything.

386
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:45,881
I know what you mean.

387
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:50,427
Sometimes I swear
she sits next to me.

388
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:52,592
Even inside me.

389
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:58,870
When I had my stroke, I saw
no white light or anything, but ...

390
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:00,871
I could feel that she was with me.

391
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:15,706
- Why are you here all along?
- Here's less traffic.

392
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:19,887
I'm thinking
go back to school.

393
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:26,165
- In the spring you can go to school.
- Not in the spring, but within a few weeks.

394
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,981
Look how far I've progressed.

395
00:40:28,982 --> 00:40:32,011
- I can drive myself to school.
- One step at a time.

396
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:39,156
I've already spoken with the dean.
The school supports me one hundred ...

397
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:41,271
- Mom?
- On the side.

398
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:45,084
- On the side.
- Mom.

399
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,085
You have a seizure.

400
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,362
Do not worry, honey.

401
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:54,458
It'll be fine.

402
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,088
You have a seizure.

403
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:05,249
- Mom!
- It'll be over.

404
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,012
It is well.

405
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:27,868
During the restoration of the second operation,
make new abnormal nerve connections

406
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:32,198
which can cause seizures.
As you experienced.

407
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,878
- Will there be more?
- Very probably.

408
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:40,142
- Would anticonvulsant help?
- Is there a drug-free way?

409
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:45,393
You need to stressful situations and large
amounts avoid sensory information.

410
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:48,219
- Maybe, but not back to school.
- I'm going back to school.

411
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,848
- Is that a good idea?
- I recommend to preliminary therapy to continue at home.

412
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:57,095
Since it is easier
in order to monitor the situation.

413
00:41:57,096 --> 00:42:01,016
We can do everything
Spring reassess.

414
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:06,292
The final decision rests
However, you and your family.

415
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,879
- ATO, here we come.
- ATO.

416
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,911
- Is that boy, <i> Sundance </ i>, still in school?
- That's still there.

417
00:42:20,912 --> 00:42:24,158
That boy is crazy.
I think I get more money from him.

418
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,539
Wait, Cory.
Let me help you.

419
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,040
It succeeds dad.
Thanks anyway.

420
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:38,047
Three and a half hours, Pops.
Hopefully you have some good music.

421
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:40,648
I think I own
all the way going to sing.

422
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,510
- Was that it?
- Yep.

423
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:54,039
- Keep you strong, boy.
- I will miss you.

424
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:56,828
Mam ...

425
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,643
Do not ... do not cry.

426
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:07,041
Easy for you
to say that.

427
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:12,221
Thanks to you, I have come this far.
You did.

428
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,467
Should you ever let me go, anyway.
If I fail, then ...

429
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,262
- What then. Then I come back home.
- You'll do it.

430
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:24,031
Thank you.

431
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:27,324
Thanks to you...

432
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:33,386
- I love you.
- Yes, I love you.

433
00:43:35,387 --> 00:43:38,805
Pops! Off to school.

434
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,640
SECOND YEAR

435
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,427
Weissman, look at that.
You've still got it.

436
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:11,774
This is still nothing, coach.
Wait till I get back.

437
00:44:11,975 --> 00:44:14,975
One step at a time.
That is recovering.

438
00:44:15,223 --> 00:44:17,387
I mean, not rehabilitation.

439
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:23,449
- I mean when I return to the team.
- Cory, you know that I will always support.

440
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,912
I know it now
all a bit premature,

441
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:32,407
but I make a lot of progress.
I'll be back.

442
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:36,223
You know why I'm yours
so wanted to join the team?

443
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:37,734
Because of my good looks?

444
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:42,725
Because you are one of those players
which passes through walls as needed.

445
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:47,480
Watch how you handle your accident.
Many would have given up already.

446
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:50,944
But not you.
That's why I love you so, as a player,

447
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:52,945
and as a person.

448
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:58,955
If basketball was only going to perseverance,
there would be a shoe for you to be named.

449
00:44:58,956 --> 00:45:04,584
But we both know that at this level,
Basketball is a heavy, physical and foul play.

450
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:09,996
If you have the resources to compete not have,
it does not matter how big your heart is.

451
00:45:09,997 --> 00:45:15,041
I'm honest with you,
because I respect you as a man.

452
00:45:15,842 --> 00:45:19,721
I know how much
you want to return.

453
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:25,584
- I'd like you to come back.
- Coach.

454
00:45:25,585 --> 00:45:28,182
I scored a thousand points
in high school.

455
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:33,162
I'm going to my school not
finish with zero points.

456
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:37,770
Okay, maybe not this year.
But next year!

457
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:48,571
Coach.
I should be part of the team.

458
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:53,529
I will do whatever it takes.

459
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:59,530
We need someone to track
statistics and help exercises.

460
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:02,560
Yes, I will.

461
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:09,333
- But I'm going to play again, coach.
- Okay.

462
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:14,679
Here, Monday, 17:00.
Be on time.

463
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,980
All right, Coach.

464
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:22,959
And I'm going to score.

465
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:31,200
That kid ruined the whole party.

466
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:33,001
Yes, not normal.

467
00:46:45,057 --> 00:46:50,057
Very funny. Very funny.
You guys are hilarious.

468
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,490
Let's start.
Two rows.

469
00:47:14,284 --> 00:47:16,284
Are you going to fill the water bottles.

470
00:47:18,614 --> 00:47:21,211
Show me what you got.

471
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:22,712
Touch the line!

472
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:29,109
- Put that down time!
- Okay, guys, pace!

473
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,670
Come on!

474
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,188
Touch the line!

475
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,883
Who's first?

476
00:47:45,243 --> 00:47:47,424
Okay, water break.

477
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,603
Good job.
Nice pace, man.

478
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:55,881
I would do anything at this time,
to swap places with you.

479
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:02,160
Well done, man.
Good job.

480
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:07,542
What classes you follow?

481
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:12,954
Sociology, kinesiology
and linear algebra.

482
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:15,769
You're not kidding about the
do full selection.

483
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,934
I'm really excited.

484
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:22,346
- Work hard or go home.
- Pops wants to go home.

485
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:26,147
- See you later.
- See you later.

486
00:48:27,244 --> 00:48:31,573
Class, I want you on the matter
the spiercelvezels understand.

487
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:35,037
Muscle cells consist of myofibril.

488
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:39,584
Each consists of myofibril
hundreds of sarcomeres

489
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,748
which lie one behind the other.

490
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:46,094
When the muscle contracts,
shrink the sarcomeres ...

491
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:52,141
... By the side of
the myosin hyphae.

492
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:55,388
Take the text that I gave you.

493
00:48:55,389 --> 00:48:59,889
and then we take some notes on.

494
00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:13,760
- I'll make you into.
- Please boy, computers let me win.

495
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:18,740
- Let you win?
- You throw only 80 percent, that's a problem.

496
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:23,287
- You're the problem.
- What?

497
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:29,133
Last week you badly in this game, now you play badly
and probably play again next week bad.

498
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:32,813
Okay. Want to tell me
What's bothering you?

499
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:36,114
Nothing.
Play now but.

500
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:45,222
So you're not telling me?

501
00:50:46,902 --> 00:50:50,181
I must invent through
a list in the locker room?

502
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,778
You start as <i> point guard </ i>, dude.

503
00:50:55,779 --> 00:51:00,541
That violent man.
Congratulations.

504
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:02,922
I did not know how you'd take it.

505
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:04,723
I am happy for you.

506
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:17,316
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

507
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:33,181
Cory! Is everything okay?

508
00:51:35,182 --> 00:51:37,444
Oh my God.
Are you okay?

509
00:51:38,645 --> 00:51:41,709
Is everything alright?
Let me help you.

510
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,172
- I am fine!
- Let me help you.

511
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:47,573
Sit down.

512
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:56,467
Sit down.

513
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:06,539
- Guest
- It's okay, dude.

514
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,532
I have only three times
cried in my entire life.

515
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,011
And the last eight months ...

516
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:24,992
I do not know what happens to me.

517
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:28,239
You were always better than me, Cory.

518
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,219
Pops ...
You do not say.

519
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,817
Oh yes,
because it's true.

520
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:40,796
That does not
I must be a jerk

521
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:43,828
thinking you my place
have taken on the team.

522
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:46,829
You're only human.

523
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:59,849
I mean...
It's all better, right?

524
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:03,961
- Sure, man.
- Eventually, it should anyway.

525
00:53:03,962 --> 00:53:07,962
Have you ever considered,
to talk to someone?

526
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:17,123
The only time I ever such a thing
have been done during rehabilitation.

527
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:23,447
There was such a strange therapist there
thought I'd kill myself.

528
00:53:23,448 --> 00:53:27,448
Was the only time that I was considering at
when that guy talked to me.

529
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:39,251
Should I talk about my childhood
or so?

530
00:53:39,252 --> 00:53:43,148
I do not think we back
should go to your childhood.

531
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:45,962
What brought you here today?

532
00:53:45,963 --> 00:53:50,509
I've had a stroke last year.
And I just started school again.

533
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,890
I was really excited.

534
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:57,552
I was glad I had my life again
could get back on track.

535
00:53:58,953 --> 00:54:05,015
It is actually anyway
harder than I expected.

536
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:08,696
- What?
- According to the doctors, my brains

537
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:15,190
still not fully recovered,
so I get tired easily.

538
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:17,736
I can not learn.

539
00:54:19,737 --> 00:54:23,149
I'm tense.
Really tense.

540
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,727
I can not ...

541
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,228
I never
been depressed.

542
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:39,229
So you think that the stroke
the cause of the depression?

543
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:43,118
It is said that therapists
just ask questions.

544
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,881
- We are a curious people.
- Everyone tells me,

545
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:51,129
I have too much hay
Take my fork.

546
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:55,459
I just want as quickly as possible
return to how it was.

547
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:02,603
- Why the rush?
- When I was 13, I broke my leg in football.

548
00:55:02,604 --> 00:55:06,284
A guy tackled me from behind.
It was a complicated fracture.

549
00:55:06,285 --> 00:55:11,912
It looked bad. The doctor said
that the recovery would last half a year.

550
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:15,292
and eight months,
before I could play again.

551
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:21,239
After four months I did
again join a tournament.

552
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,620
I set a goal,
and reached that goal.

553
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:27,301
- What are your goals now?
- Return on the basketball court.

554
00:55:27,302 --> 00:55:31,446
So you want to be the same Cory
and before your stroke.

555
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,470
Yes.

556
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:37,260
And that will happen.

557
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:42,061
THIRD YEAR

558
00:55:55,447 --> 00:55:59,775
Right there. You see?
That's going a lot better.

559
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:04,848
That feels good.
Unbelievable.

560
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:16,663
Excuse me.
Hi.

561
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:20,776
- I'm Cory.
- I am treated at my ankle.

562
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:25,539
Yes I can see that.
Does that mean I should not know your name?

563
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,920
- I'm Jess.
- Nice to meet you, Jess.

564
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:32,467
Are you new here?
I still have not seen.

565
00:56:32,468 --> 00:56:34,848
I am a first-year student.

566
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:38,746
- Welcome to Gettysburg.
- Cory, this is not the time.

567
00:56:38,747 --> 00:56:42,209
You should know that I
not trying to decorate though.

568
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:47,622
I am a third year student.
We must welcome the new welcome.

569
00:56:47,623 --> 00:56:51,086
So it is rather my duty.

570
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:53,900
The school will appreciate your sacrifice.

571
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:57,580
That is certainly appreciated.
They call me a doer all here, right?

572
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,081
Among other things.

573
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:04,375
I have sprained my ankle.
And I hate it.

574
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:10,271
- I can not move me well.
- I know the feeling.

575
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:13,635
Believe me, it sucks.

576
00:57:13,736 --> 00:57:15,900
How about yourself,
Mr. doer?

577
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:19,201
I also have a sore ankle.

578
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:22,078
It really hurts.
We have something in common.

579
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:25,076
- Keep working on it.
- I will.

580
00:57:25,077 --> 00:57:30,705
- It was nice to meet you.
- Bye.

581
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:34,952
- Just?
- It does occasionally really hurt.

582
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:36,963
Really.

583
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:44,561
Listen!
Brand new year guys.

584
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,942
Last season has been!

585
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:49,541
The future is ours!

586
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:52,138
I think I my
speech should be revised.

587
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:57,139
- Looks good, Cory.
- 500 shots per day ensures there.

588
00:57:57,552 --> 00:58:01,031
Let's start then.
Form the rows.

589
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:02,482
Where are you going?

590
00:58:02,483 --> 00:58:05,783
- Water Bottle Filling
- I told the team to form rows.

591
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:21,151
Come on!

592
00:58:40,202 --> 00:58:42,999
If we continue
will be fine.

593
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,526
Yeah, you're Pop's size.

594
00:58:53,193 --> 00:58:55,693
Try it.

595
00:58:58,171 --> 00:58:59,552
No.

596
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:03,553
I wait until I really
may use in a game.

597
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:06,182
It looks good.

598
00:59:06,183 --> 00:59:08,183
Yes definitely.

599
00:59:12,027 --> 00:59:16,573
- Hey Sundance? Well played today.
- Thank you.

600
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:18,971
That was great?
How is the company?

601
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,448
Not bad.

602
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:23,472
- The new girls will soon come.
- Okay.

603
00:59:23,502 --> 00:59:25,502
So you like basketball?

604
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:29,749
I'll be right back.

605
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,986
You know that we are the only student in the
campus that serves pizza at our parties?

606
00:59:42,987 --> 00:59:45,800
- That can not be true.
- Really.

607
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:49,481
- How are you?
- Good.

608
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:53,482
- How are you?
- My ankle hurts a lot.

609
00:59:53,595 --> 00:59:57,095
That's too bad.
I'm Cory.

610
00:59:59,657 --> 01:00:03,121
- I'm Jess.
- Nice to meet you, Jess.

611
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:08,122
- What year are you?
- First.

612
01:00:09,617 --> 01:00:13,461
- Was that strange question?
- Do you mean this?

613
01:00:15,462 --> 01:00:18,440
Wait. What did I ...?

614
01:00:20,441 --> 01:00:23,441
Jess! Hey Jess.

615
01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:28,739
Wait a second.
I have offended you in any way?

616
01:00:29,118 --> 01:00:32,230
We have another two days
ago met in the gym.

617
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:35,231
- I remember.
- Cool. Bye.

618
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,087
No, no, listen.

619
01:00:37,088 --> 01:00:40,355
You do not understand, I forgot
because I had a stroke.

620
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:43,173
Okay. You are a
student with a stroke.

621
01:00:43,174 --> 01:00:45,338
I mean I really had a stroke.

622
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:49,884
Damaged brain tissue and blood vessels
broke. Everything. The AVM was torn.

623
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:53,885
- You should not joke about.
- Pops!

624
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:58,544
- Will you tell her about my brains.
- That's a mush.

625
01:00:58,545 --> 01:01:00,926
- And my memory?
- Disappeared.

626
01:01:00,927 --> 01:01:04,539
- And were you in the hospital?
- Every day.

627
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,854
I'm still recovering.

628
01:01:07,855 --> 01:01:10,855
It's pretty heroic,
if you think about it.

629
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:15,206
Oh, you two have been together ...

630
01:01:16,748 --> 01:01:18,748
That's actually kinda cute,
He liked you so beautiful,

631
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:21,749
- That he wanted to meet you twice.
- Exactly

632
01:01:26,706 --> 01:01:30,901
I first started in the third grade
to play high school.

633
01:01:31,702 --> 01:01:34,516
Amazing and still in the team.
That is fantastic.

634
01:01:34,717 --> 01:01:38,613
It was hard work but I
did not think I would find it so much.

635
01:01:38,614 --> 01:01:42,294
I never thought of myself as a
Lacrosse seen playing athlete.

636
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:46,489
What did you do first?
What?

637
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,628
It is embarrassing.

638
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:52,142
- Now you have to tell me.
- I wanted to fight.

639
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,698
- What? Pest?
- Yes.

640
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:00,263
- I hate bugs.
- Yes, me too.

641
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:02,861
Does not mean that all my life
go spend to make them dead.

642
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:06,325
- I'm mad that ankle.
- Yes you are walking with a slight limp.

643
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:09,139
You look like me.

644
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,735
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

645
01:02:14,336 --> 01:02:17,336
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

646
01:02:20,182 --> 01:02:22,862
I had a nice evening.

647
01:02:23,863 --> 01:02:25,975
Yes, really nice evening.

648
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:31,987
- Yeah, not bad.
- Not bad?

649
01:02:33,388 --> 01:02:35,985
- I Was not entertaining enough?
- No not at all.

650
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:40,232
Did not you have fun with me?
I had a lot of fun.

651
01:02:40,533 --> 01:02:43,602
-Maybe I lied a little.
Maybe.

652
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,770
Now I have even more fun.

653
01:03:01,317 --> 01:03:04,346
Yes, if you do not now
more recalls, after that?

654
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:09,053
I have a blackout.
I think I need more memory.

655
01:03:17,354 --> 01:03:20,054
- That felt good.
- Yes.

656
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:50,007
Keith, change!

657
01:03:55,008 --> 01:03:56,508
- Back play, Nino.

658
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:09,678
Be careful now!

659
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,679
Look out, Tim!

660
01:04:40,473 --> 01:04:43,236
- Want me to get help?
- No!

661
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:47,400
- You do not want me to call someone?
- No.

662
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:50,463
Okay, it'll be fine.
I'm here.

663
01:04:53,464 --> 01:04:57,964
It's okay, all right.
I'm here.

664
01:05:14,264 --> 01:05:17,294
His chances this season
play with less.

665
01:05:17,295 --> 01:05:19,295
You think he's ready?

666
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:32,470
I know, if he does not play,
he collapses.

667
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:45,253
Cory. Come to my office.

668
01:05:48,054 --> 01:05:50,054
This does work.

669
01:05:59,512 --> 01:06:02,512
- Hey.
- Hey, coach.

670
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:09,253
I must tell you this season
have made a great impression on me.

671
01:06:09,254 --> 01:06:12,934
First in training
and last to leave.

672
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:16,181
I know that you train as a
beast in your spare time.

673
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:18,282
I'll do whatever it takes, coach.

674
01:06:21,162 --> 01:06:25,162
I also know how much you
want to join a game.

675
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:31,739
- But that will not succeed.
- What?

676
01:06:32,204 --> 01:06:36,748
You're better, but you're not done yet.
I know you still have seizures.

677
01:06:36,749 --> 01:06:39,264
I'm going to get no attack
during the game.

678
01:06:39,265 --> 01:06:43,160
If it happens there ...
The risk is too great.

679
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:47,739
Coach.
I've earned this.

680
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:54,107
I know. Sorry.

681
01:07:31,324 --> 01:07:32,624
And?

682
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:53,622
My whole life...

683
01:07:53,623 --> 01:07:56,870
I thought everything
happens for a reason.

684
01:07:56,871 --> 01:08:00,767
That's right, Cory.

685
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:03,063
It also happens for a reason.

686
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:09,107
I have in my entire life
never given up anything.

687
01:08:12,908 --> 01:08:15,289
For the first time,
I consider it.

688
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:18,537
After everything you've been through,
why now?

689
01:08:18,538 --> 01:08:21,538
I realized that I'm living in a dream.

690
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:29,010
I thought, if you work hard,
you can achieve anything.

691
01:08:30,011 --> 01:08:33,011
As all these stupid tile
wisdoms on my wall.

692
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:42,217
Things happen in life. Some
people are good, some are not.

693
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:46,331
That's a stark view.

694
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,178
Think about it, Cory.

695
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:54,475
Two years ago you were paralyzed.

696
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:57,722
When you went back to school,

697
01:08:57,723 --> 01:09:00,321
and inspired other people.

698
01:09:00,322 --> 01:09:03,716
Nobody would by me
to be inspired.

699
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:08,017
If that is so, see
they are things that are not there.

700
01:09:10,497 --> 01:09:15,476
So you're just a kid,
who can no longer play basketball.

701
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:19,677
With all due respect, this has
nothing to do with basketball.

702
01:09:21,106 --> 01:09:22,950
I ...

703
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:29,451
I just want to be myself again.

704
01:09:29,549 --> 01:09:33,560
- Maybe that's the problem.
- What?

705
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:39,761
- You no longer Cory can be.
- Really?

706
01:09:41,456 --> 01:09:43,837
I do not really have a choice.

707
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:46,868
- The old Cory is gone.
- Sorry, what?

708
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:49,895
- The old Cory is gone.
- Sorry, I ...

709
01:09:49,896 --> 01:09:52,896
The old Cory is gone!
He is dead!

710
01:09:55,096 --> 01:09:57,096
Do you hear me?

711
01:10:02,673 --> 01:10:05,073
He was buried.

712
01:10:11,334 --> 01:10:15,895
That does not mean there
no new Cory can be.

713
01:10:16,096 --> 01:10:21,396
That is ten times more,
Cory than ever.

714
01:10:31,467 --> 01:10:34,065
<I> Cory, you do not know me. </ I>

715
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:37,528
<I> I heard the story of your
return on local radio. </ i>

716
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:41,209
<I> I hope you do not
mind that I write to you. </ i>

717
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:45,755
<I> Like you, my six-year-old
son also an athlete. </ i>
718
01:10:45,756 --> 01:10:50,302
<I> He also has an AVM
and had a stroke. </ i>

718
01:10:50,303 --> 01:10:52,683
<I> A portion of its left hand side
is still paralyzed </ i>

719
01:10:52,684 --> 01:10:58,312
<I> and the doctors are not sure
how well he will recover. </ i>

720
01:10:58,313 --> 01:11:00,911
<I> Evan is a fighter
and he does his best. </ i> "

721
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:05,890
<I> But, as you probably know,
some days are more difficult than others </ i>

722
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:12,168
<I> I told him about you, how you try again
to play and that motivated him tremendously. </ i>

723
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:15,416
<I> I understand you probably busy
you with your studies and basketball </ i>

724
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:19,313
<I> But if you ever have the time
to write Evan or even call </ i>

725
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:21,911
<I> that would mean a lot to him. </ I>

726
01:11:21,912 --> 01:11:25,808
<I> Thank you for your time and I
hope I have not offended. </ i>

727
01:11:25,809 --> 01:11:28,809
<I> Sincerely,
Jen Carlow. </ I>

728
01:11:34,469 --> 01:11:36,469
Beautiful.

729
01:11:36,851 --> 01:11:40,097
- How are you, Pops?
- Someone was absent from the exercises.

730
01:11:40,098 --> 01:11:43,561
- The team is not the same without you.
- Yes I know.

731
01:11:43,562 --> 01:11:45,808
They certainly miss their mascot.

732
01:11:46,809 --> 01:11:50,809
I am serious.
The team respects you.

733
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:56,232
- So you're coming back next year, right?
- I do not know.

734
01:11:58,933 --> 01:12:02,262
How long can someone
to sit on the bench?

735
01:12:04,563 --> 01:12:09,540
- Beautiful. Bring it on.
- Really?

736
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:13,221
- come on.
- Really, guest?

737
01:12:13,222 --> 01:12:15,067
Go.

738
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,448
You see?

739
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:24,518
That has nothing to do with your stroke
make, you could never left.

740
01:12:38,985 --> 01:12:42,232
LAST YEAR

741
01:12:48,512 --> 01:12:52,624
Thank you all for coming.
I do not know...

742
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:56,625
Can someone write this quickly.
It's his new Gettysburg Address.

743
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,739
I want to say something.

744
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:03,233
Cory, you know,
when you got your stroke,

745
01:13:03,234 --> 01:13:06,713
that was the scariest
moment of my life.

746
01:13:06,914 --> 01:13:09,728
I can not imagine
how it was for you.

747
01:13:09,729 --> 01:13:14,057
I think nobody
that can be imagined.

748
01:13:14,058 --> 01:13:19,470
But I do know that you are the strongest,
coolest guy are in this room.

749
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:23,071
And I want you to know
I'm always behind you.

750
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:29,429
- I know Pops. Thank you.
- No.

751
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,057
- I could not help with the packing.
- Really.

752
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:38,305
What is this?
I hope for you it's something beautiful.

753
01:13:38,306 --> 01:13:41,512
At least one <i> monogram print </ i>.

754
01:13:51,513 --> 01:13:53,513
Not really.

755
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,875
Guest.

756
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:06,116
Thank you, Pops.

757
01:14:07,117 --> 01:14:13,178
This is the second best gift
that I have ever received from you.

758
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:18,591
- Second, what is the first?
- When you have saved my life, dude. Thank you.

759
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:24,385
I'd say you've got something I owe,
but some things can not be refunded.

760
01:14:26,386 --> 01:14:30,498
- I know.
- I want to practice on Monday, what do you think of it.

761
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,746
That's what I meant.

762
01:14:33,747 --> 01:14:37,158
Okay, <i> whatup </ i>
Let's party, come on!

763
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:41,756
That was good cut ...

764
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:44,787
Good work, guys!

765
01:14:44,788 --> 01:14:48,788
Before you shower,
Friday is our first game.

766
01:14:52,582 --> 01:14:55,211
Time to vote for your captain.
For the novices among you,

767
01:14:55,212 --> 01:14:59,212
Coaches have nothing to do with it.
It is yours.

768
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:33,304
Okay.
The first captain ... Tim Lang.

769
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:41,532
Number two. The final year student
with Salt-n-Pepa Hair, Pops.

770
01:15:43,893 --> 01:15:46,489
Super!

771
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:50,169
Number three.

772
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,170
Congratulations, Cory.

773
01:16:07,924 --> 01:16:13,335
You are listening to Sport 1090. Online with
Gettysburg head basketball coach George Petrie.

774
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:16,582
- A fantastic season, coach.
- There is still work to do, but thank you.

775
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,830
Tell us something about
the final Saturday.

776
01:16:19,831 --> 01:16:24,376
Washington is a tough team.
Coach Nugent has done a good job.

777
01:16:24,377 --> 01:16:29,377
It is also an important match. You
can Gettysburg coach with the most profit are.

778
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:32,401
We are not focusing on,
it is seniors day.

779
01:16:32,405 --> 01:16:36,405
Hopefully we assist guests on
the right path for their new season.

780
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,662
Good! Good!

781
01:16:42,906 --> 01:16:46,369
- Hey, Pops.
- Hey, coach. do you have a moment?

782
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:50,483
- What's bugging you?
- Cory.

783
01:16:50,484 --> 01:16:55,895
Oh, me too. I spent three nights
not slept with him.

784
01:16:55,896 --> 01:17:00,225
It's now or never.
He sat on the bench for two years.

785
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:03,906
Have you ever wondered
how it will end for him

786
01:17:03,907 --> 01:17:08,235
if he gets injured or
attack gets for the home crowd?

787
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:11,916
- I know it's a risk.
- And then also the school's responsibility.

788
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:14,029
Yeah, but he's ...
-Pops.

789
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:18,586
I know that making the right decision.

790
01:17:28,587 --> 01:17:32,587
Cory?
Got a minute?

791
01:17:56,515 --> 01:17:59,041
- Hey?
- Hey, Mom.

792
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:09,542
I spoke with the coach
about tomorrow's game.

793
01:18:13,836 --> 01:18:16,836
I stand at the base, Mom.

794
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:27,000
I stand at the base.

795
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:22,032
Cory?

796
01:19:22,033 --> 01:19:25,033
Pops told me you were here.

797
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:32,595
So, how are you today?

798
01:19:34,373 --> 01:19:37,003
- I'm alright.
- Beautiful.

799
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:45,414
- How are you?
- I was gonna call you when I heard the news.

800
01:19:45,415 --> 01:19:47,715
but I did not dare.

801
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:52,994
I just wanted to congratulate you.

802
01:19:54,508 --> 01:19:59,508
I know how hard you've worked for.
I'm proud of you.

803
01:19:59,921 --> 01:20:01,583
Thank you.

804
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:07,384
Well, do your best.

805
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:11,813
Maybe more than that.

806
01:20:13,993 --> 01:20:20,693
Ally. I want you to know that I understand
what happened between us.

807
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:29,044
You do not have to feel guilty about anything.
Everything is good.

808
01:20:52,121 --> 01:20:54,718
- Coach.
- Do not count on your great victory.

809
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,019
- That's why they play. Good luck.
- You too

810
01:21:04,678 --> 01:21:07,957
Cory. You know you
there must be off after the start.

811
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:12,071
- I would have loved to.
- Is there really no way?

812
01:21:12,472 --> 01:21:15,672
- I can not risk a shot?
- No.

813
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,400
Okay, coach.

814
01:21:21,565 --> 01:21:24,894
And now, starting with Gettysburg College.

815
01:21:25,695 --> 01:21:28,695
<I> Power forward </ i>: Tim Lang.

816
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,939
<I> Small forward </ i>: Alex Sturn.

817
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:43,117
<I> Center </ i>: Christian Bohré.

818
01:21:47,345 --> 01:21:51,345
<I> Shooting guard </ i>: Brendan Trelease.

819
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:59,171
And <i> Point guard </ i> ...

820
01:22:02,933 --> 01:22:06,933
... Cory Weissman!

821
01:22:21,768 --> 01:22:24,015
Come here!

822
01:22:25,016 --> 01:22:29,116
- Bullets at three.
- One, two, three, Bullets!

823
01:22:30,861 --> 01:22:32,361
Cory!

824
01:23:27,151 --> 01:23:28,377
Follow!

825
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,978
Put pressure on the ball!

826
01:23:44,271 --> 01:23:45,771
Mount, Christian!

827
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,180
In formation!

828
01:23:58,343 --> 01:24:01,343
Cory.
Go in.

829
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:05,689
Come on.

830
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:13,468
He goes in there.
They put him in there!

831
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,880
- He can join!
- We know, honey.

832
01:24:34,065 --> 01:24:35,465
Go for it, Cory!

833
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,085
Go, Cory!

834
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:53,632
Time out.
Gathering.

835
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:56,133
Come here.

836
01:24:58,747 --> 01:25:03,857
Come here. I do not know what he plans
but we still have 20 seconds.

837
01:25:03,858 --> 01:25:07,105
Stay focused, okay.
Bullets, three.

838
01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:09,606
One, two, three, Bullets!

839
01:25:19,964 --> 01:25:22,292
Throw the ball to Cory!
Throw to No. 3!

840
01:25:24,293 --> 01:25:26,293
Beware, beware!

841
01:25:32,087 --> 01:25:34,087
They made an offense.

842
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:46,644
He goes to the line.

843
01:25:51,356 --> 01:25:53,356
He has two pitches!

844
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:04,584
You can make him better.

845
01:27:29,446 --> 01:27:33,125
Coach, I do not want anything
I've earned yourself.

846
01:27:33,326 --> 01:27:36,326
Remember the knees, Cory.
Knees.

847
01:27:37,873 --> 01:27:40,173
I scored a thousand points
in high school.

848
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:43,770
I will play again, coach.

849
01:27:45,018 --> 01:27:49,018
I finish my school
not with zero points.

850
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:54,313
I'm going to score.

851
01:28:34,812 --> 01:28:39,812
-Cory! Cory! Cory!
-Thank You, coach.

852
01:28:43,472 --> 01:28:44,832
Thank you.

853
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,333
- Well done, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

854
01:28:53,564 --> 01:28:56,364
- Good.
- Have you seen those last moments?

855
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:08,472
People say I have not changed,
but that is certainly so.

856
01:29:09,169 --> 01:29:14,169
I am a new Cory now
and I'm glad.

857
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:25,092
I went to hell.

858
01:29:37,197 --> 01:29:41,197
And I'm not going to someone
otherwise to leave there.

859
01:30:12,803 --> 01:30:16,730
Although we can not always see it ...

860
01:30:19,731 --> 01:30:23,731
... everything happens for a reason.
