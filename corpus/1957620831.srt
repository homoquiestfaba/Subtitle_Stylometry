and you're the deep one.

I have no idea.

530

What, dear?

531
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:08,154
Have you ever been attracted
to another man besides Daddy?

532
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,222
(GASPS) What a question!

533
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,725

wedding anniversary!

somehow confounds me.

Nope.

It was only your father
from the first day we met.

539
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,377
Didn't you ever
look at another man
in a mall or...

540
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,081
A movie...

541
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,483
And just for one moment,
wonder what it would be like?

Beverly Jean, I don't want to
ever hear you talk like that.

543

Oh, but you're only human.
It happens to everybody once.

What are you accusing me of?

Nothing. Nothing.

forgotten a thing.

00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:01,507
I still remember our old
telephone number, 43668.

549
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,075
We only had five digits then.

550
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:08,047
Well, I'm, going to go see
how everybody's doing.

-Honey?
-Hmm?

552

Uh, can I be honest with you
about something?

00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,188
You won't be offended,
will you?

554
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,324
No, not at all, Mother, what?

555
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,260
I don't know
if it was your idea
or your friend Susan's,

556
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:25,798
but, dear,
nobody uses butter anymore.

You've been
to the market lately?

or did he see you?

We ran into each other
a couple of times.

He was flat out direct,
didn't mince any words.

572

He said if I wanted to get
to know him better,

573
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,881

his last name

till the second time
we took the hotel room.

578

on his credit card?

he was at the gym.

invented sex,

start the conversation, Jean.

to change the subject
like I was sub-human,

you brought it up
in the first place?

look at each other.

you know?

No.

But you pay for it
in other ways.

even if it means
hurting somebody's feelings.

704
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:42,661
Sparing people's feelings
can become a lifelong job,

705
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,364
and you lose yourself.

706
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:48,767
I don't want her to spend
the rest of her life
pleasing others.

707
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,538
-Have you?
-No.

708
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,606
Yeah.

709
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,575
A little.

710
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,781
Roger's the nicest man I know.

711
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,383
He would move heaven
and earth for me.

712
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,786
He's strong, plays softball.

713
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:10,522
Well, he used to play
on the softball team,
team broke up.

714
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,759
Tell me about Carol.

715
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,397
Well, she's decent, caring.

716
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,732
She wanted to have
a lot of kids.

717
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:24,970
When Kevin was born,
there were some complications
so we couldn't have anymore,

718
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,805
which was a boon
for three-legged dogs.

719
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,041
I'll explain that.

720
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:34,045
See, there was a time
when we had two
three-legged dogs.

721
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,648
No one else would take them in
so Carol did,

722
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,551
separately,
several months apart.

723
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:42,120
Till they died,
they just jumped
and hobbled around,

724
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,955
happy as they could be.

725
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,758
She loves
what nobody else does.

726
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,863
She's not a saint,
but she's very kind.

727
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,936
So, that's why I really
don't know why I'm here.

728
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:00,839
But you're a bright woman...

729
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,510
I was hoping
you could tell me.

730
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,346
Not so bright, Tom.

731
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,050
If I were, I would've run
that yellow light

732
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,819
and followed Susan
as fast as I could.

733
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,087
But do you know,
to hell with it.

734
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,656
I don't think I care.

735
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,098
I just wanted to see
what that would be like.

736
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,101
Just curious?

737
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:32,804
Yes.

738
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,575
Still curious?

739
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,644
Mmm-hmm.

740
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,170
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

741
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,572
Still curious?

742
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,676
I got to go.

743
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,712
Well, we solved
your curiosity,
what about mine?

744
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,615
Tom, this has been
so much fun. Thank you!

745
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:17,949
-Jean?
-Thank you.

746
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:23,822
(DOOR OPENS)

747
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,107
What time is it?

748
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,643
-JEAN: Midnight.
-(GROANS)

749
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,914
How do you stay up so late,
then get up so early?

750
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,018
You're a better sleeper
than I am.

751
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:13,872
(CHUCKLES)

752
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,073
(DOOR OPENS)

753
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,478
-Hi, heard you come in.
-Hi.

754
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,984
I made a chocolate cake
from scratch.

755
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,186
I just wanted to see
if I still knew how.

756
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,689
How about a nice big piece?
Price is right.

757
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,023
No, thanks.

758
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,126
So, what did you
see tonight?

759
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:37,829
Wuthering Heights.

760
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,531
Ah, my Achilles heel.

761
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,701
They assigned that to us
in high school.

762
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:43,935
I could hardly
finish reading it.

763
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,036
I never did see
the movie.

764
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,807
Maybe I should
read the book again.

765
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,642
All I remember are a lot
of people running around.

766
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,580
Ah, what was it called?

767
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:55,614
The moors!

768
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,315
Running and crying,

769
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,217
and crying and running!

770
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,119
(CHUCKLES)

771
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,921
I'll just rent the video
sometime.

772
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,594
Come to bed.

773
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,030
-I'll be up in a minute.
-Okay.

774
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,053
(DIALING)

775
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,824
(RINGING)

776
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,694
WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Reservation!

777
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,295
May I help you?

778
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,300
Um, yes, I'd like to
reserve a room, please.

779
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,369
Uh, certainly. 
 A single or double?

780
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,370
A double.

781
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,206
Um, for me and my wife.

782
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,775
All right, 
 and your name, please.

783
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,209
Yeah, it's Doster.

784
00:42:58,243 --> 00:42:59,778
Tom Doster.

785
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,148
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Doster.

786
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:08,253
Jose, could you
help Mrs. Winsinger
with her car, please?

787
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:09,788
-Por favor. 
 -Yeah.

788
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:11,189
-Gracias. (CHUCKLES)
 -De nada.

789
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,695
Bye, Bess.

790
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:17,963
Hi, honey!

791
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,633
Your Spanish test?

792
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,169
How bad was it?

793
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,672
-Can we go to the mall?
-The mall?

794
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,039
Honey, we take you there
when you get an A

795
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:30,308
and your daddy and I
want to reward you.

796
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:33,378
Well, I'm getting to the age
where I need to go to the mall
to alleviate depression.

797
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,416
Tada!

798
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,385
You are 14 years old!

799
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:41,386
I'm almost 15.

800
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,922
Luther will love this,
it'll drive him crazy!

801
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,924
There's no way
Luther or anyone else

802
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,426
is going to see
your chest at age 14.

803
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,361
He already has, Mom.

804
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:51,596
Take it off.

805
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,833
I wouldn't buy that for you
if you were fluent in Spanish.

806
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,972
BESS: I know what
you're going to say.

807
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:03,875
What exactly have you
and Luther done together?

808
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:05,276
It's private, Mom.

809
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,045
Yes, it is.

810
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,980
It's private between
you and him and me.

811
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:11,683
We haven't done anything.

812
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,052
A little.

813
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,954
Mom, we've talked
about this before.

814
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,289
There's only reason
for a man and woman
to have sex

815
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,826
and that's because
they love each other.

816
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,928
Yeah, but sex
is not a sport, honey.

817
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,796
Sit down here for a second.

818
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:31,903
It's a pleasure,
I know that.

819
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,206
But it's not something
you do for recreation.

820
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,710
Honey, I'm not asking
you to wait forever.

821
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,979
Just wait for someone
that you really care about.

822
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,414
Did you?

823
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:44,983
-Well, honey, that's...
-Private.

824
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,954
Bess, listen to me.

825
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:53,091
Love and commitment
are the only reasons
that you have sex.

826
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:54,459
I know you're having
peer pressures.

827
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:55,927
-God...
-I know.

828
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:57,963
I don't care
about peer pressures!

829
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:59,197
What about my own pressures?

830
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,067
What about the fights
I have with myself?

831
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,970
I mean, sometimes I think
I never want to have sex

832
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:08,106
and then other times I think
why not just do it
and get it over with?

833
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,941
Not think about it.

834
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:12,343
But, Mom, the whole thing
scares me.

835
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,012
Don't you have
any feeling for that?

836
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,182
Of course I do.

837
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,451
I know there's considerations,

838
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:23,789
you've told me 100 times.

839
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:26,892
But, Mom, there's times
when I don't care about
those considerations,

840
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,459
when I just want to say
to hell with it!

841
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:33,064
Mom, don't you ever get tired
of thinking so much?

842
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,036
Sometimes.

843
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:40,806
Well, what do you do then?

844
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:45,043
(SIGHS) I don't know.

845
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,778
I haven't figured
that one out yet.

846
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:52,217
It'll be okay.

847
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,085
BESS: Okay, so, Mom,
about the birthday party.

848
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,087
Okay, I know that
my birthday is not
for another month, but...

849
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,156
Jean. I need to see you
in my office.

850
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:05,463
We'll talk about it later.

851
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,445
Close the door.

852
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:31,156
From the bank,
19 checks returned
for insufficient funds.

853
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,024
What?

854
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,127
Uh, no, no,
that can't be right.

855
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,329
I, um...

856
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,132
I, oh, God, I...

857
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,904
I wrote the checks
and I didn't make the deposit.

858
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,138
You've never done that before.

859
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,142
I'm sorry.

860
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,911
If the book keeping
is too much, just say so.

861
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:55,313
I'll help you. You don't have
to do it all yourself.

862
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,283
Honey, I'm perfectly
capable of doing it,

863
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,018
I just screwed up!

864
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,387
We've never bounced a check
since we opened this business.

865
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,322
Things like that are important
to me!

866
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,291
(LOUDLY)
They're important to me, too!

867
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:10,095
I'll take care of it.

868
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:13,031
I will call them and I will
explain everything.

869
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:15,000
Something's upsetting you.

870
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,869
I know you.

871
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,973
It's my parents. Um...

872
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,278
It takes me time to recover
from their visits.

873
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:30,148
Are you still worried about
what your folks think?

874
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,517
Jean, you're with me.
You don't have to worry
anymore about that.

875
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,985
I know.

876
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,890
You know,

was of great value,

into your soil.

1051
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:06,551
Now, does anyone know
what a bud union is?

1052
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,954
Ah, yes, young lady,
can you tell us?

1053
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:15,693
Yes, do you know
what a bud union is?

1054
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:18,162
The bud union is the heart
of the rose bush,

1055
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:22,833
it's from the bud union
that the major
new growth develops,

1056
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:25,002
if the conditions are right.

1057
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,270
Ah, there's one thing
you've left out.

1058
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:27,572
Hmm.

1059
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:30,074
If you live in
a temperate climate,

1060
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:34,078
the bud union can be placed
just above ground level,

1061
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:37,147
like so, but if you live
in a cold climate...

1062
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,917
You have to place it beneath
the surface where it's hidden.

1063
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:42,019
Now, why is that?

1064
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,854
The rose won't grow
if it's not hidden.

1065
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:46,256
That's right.

1066
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,126
Bud union's very fragile.

1067
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:52,096
Hiding it protects it against
anything that might hurt it.

It's as true for you 
 as it is for me, isn't it?

1395
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,489
WOMAN: Yes, it's true.

1396
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,198
SUSAN: Was Brief Encounter 
after Gone with the Wind?

1397
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:58,434
-What?
-Which came first?

1398
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,903
Brief Encounter or
 Gone with the Wind?

1399
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:01,270
Gone with the Wind, 
 I think.

1400
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:05,008
Trevor Howard
doesn't look like he did
in Gone with the Wind.

1401
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:07,276
Trevor Howard wasn't
in Gone with the Wind.

1402
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,879
Leslie Howard
was in Gone with the Wind.

1403
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:11,080
Really?

1404
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:13,216
I never knew they
were different people.

1405
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,818
Leslie Howard, Trevor Howard.

1406
01:19:15,819 --> 01:19:17,987
Well, what do you know.

1407
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:19,122
They're both English,
aren't they?

1408
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:21,958
They were.

1409
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:23,526
They're both dead now.

1410
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,294
SUSAN: Well,
there you have it.

1411
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:26,963
It's the way
the English talk...

1412
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:28,497
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
...from the bottom
of their throats.

1413
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:30,133
(NORMAL VOICE)
They all sound alike.

1414
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:37,506
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1415
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,009
Of course,
you'll talk about me
while I'm gone.

1416
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:42,812
Sticks and stones
can break my bones,
but words can never hurt me.

1417
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:45,114
I'm not ignorant, you know.

1418
01:19:45,148 --> 01:19:47,116
Just because
I didn't know the difference

1419
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,584
between Leslie Howard
and Trevor Howard,

1420
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,453
doesn't mean I haven't
been well educated.

1421
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:56,059
Actually, I was voted
most likely to succeed.

1422
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,029
But I got married instead.

1423
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:03,967
(CHUCKLES)

1424
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:07,370
It was a lovely movie.

1425
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:08,905
Yes, it was.

1426
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,307
I'd never seen
that one before.

1427
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,042
Yeah, I saw it a long ago,

1428
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:14,377
but I remember
it being in color.

1429
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,980
I don't remember it being
in black and white.

1430
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:19,348
Oh, they didn't seem
to film much in color then,

1431
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,483
but not much, yeah.

1432
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:25,188
-Listen, I got a call...
-You know, I was thinking...

1433
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:26,455
Oh, I'm sorry,
you go first.

1434
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,257
-No, I'm sorry, go ahead.
-No, you.

1435
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:33,196
I got a call a couple
of days ago
from a company...

1436
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,131
SUSAN:
That's it for me, folks.

1437
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,934
It was really nice
to meet you, Tom.

1438
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:39,568
It was nice to meet you, too.

1439
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:42,872
You two stay. I'm tired.

1440
01:20:42,906 --> 01:20:45,008
No, I... I have to go, too.

1441
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,976
Goodbye.
I mean goodnight.

1442
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,912
Don't let me break up
the party.

1443
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:51,480
Oh, it's all right.
I think the evening's over.

1444
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,250
Goodnight.

1445
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,655
JOSE: Senora Townsend!

1446
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,557
-Yeah?
 -Telefono.

1447
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,259
-Someone named Tom?
-Ah.

1448
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:05,228
(CHUCKLES)

1449
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,268
Still having
mildew problems, huh?

1450
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:15,571
Well, I'm having
some problems,

1451
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,006
but mildew
isn't one of them.

1452
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:19,442
Oh, I...

1453
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:21,644
Look, Jean,
I need to see you.

1454
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:24,613
I have to see you, too.

1455
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:26,182
When?

1456
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,384
Now. Right now.

1457
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,954
Um, city park, 
 by the rose garden.

1458
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,223
(DIAL TONE)

1459
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:36,125
Um, Roger?

1460
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,963
I just got a call
and I have to run over
to Taylor's

1461
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:42,265
to make a bid
for some landscaping.

1462
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:44,367
Hope they don't need it soon,
we are up to our ears.

1463
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,969
No, I don't think so.

1464
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:48,604
I think they've still
got to put in their pool.

1465
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:51,540
You mind going
and picking up Bess
after school, if I'm late?

1466
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:52,608
Sure.

1467
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,377
Thank you.

1468
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,511
See you later.

1469
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,209
(SIGHS)

1470
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:31,047
You have one, too.

1471
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:40,023
I don't quite know
how to say this.

1472
01:22:40,056 --> 01:22:42,158
(SOBBING) Oh, come on,
Beverly Jean, just say it.

1473
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:47,496
I can't see you
after this anymore, Tom.

1474
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,664
I just can't.

1475
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,771
It's not true, I can,
but I won't.

1476
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,040
I won't.

1477
01:22:59,142 --> 01:23:01,210
Seems to be the only thing
that's right.

1478
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:04,680
(SNIFFLING)
And I don't mean just right,
I mean possible.

1479
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,053
Are you angry with me?

1480
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,123
No.

1481
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:19,228
You are.

1482
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,035
I'm moving, Jean.

1483
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,572
I mean...

1484
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:31,474
We're moving,
Carol, Kevin and I.

1485
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,545
I wanted to tell you
the other night,

1486
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:38,114
but I couldn't.

1487
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:43,152
A few months ago
I got an offer

1488
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:44,787
from a company
in Seattle.

1489
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:48,157
I turned them down.

1490
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:50,193
Last week,
I called them back

1491
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:52,428
and said if they were
still interested,

1492
01:23:53,429 --> 01:23:55,231
I was.

1493
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,799
You really have to do that?
Move away?

1494
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,639
Jean, as long as I'm here,
I'll find you.

1495
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:07,376
And then,
I'll drive by your house,

1496
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,245
I'll go to the same places
you go,

1497
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:11,514
I'll take all the risks.

1498
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,582
You know how many times
I've driven by your house

1499
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:15,751
just in the hope
of seeing you?

1500
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:21,390
It's the only answer.

1501
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:24,827
And after we've been away
from each other for a while,

1502
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,664
our lives will go on.

1503
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:32,435
Maybe not right away,
but in time.

1504
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:37,740
I can't stay.

1505
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:42,245
You're a much stronger person
than I am

1506
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:44,147
and I just don't trust myself
that much.

1507
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:50,353
Sometimes when you
don't know what else to do...

1508
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:53,522
You run.

1509
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,202
Your hair is turning
a little gray.

1510
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:09,205
Mine, too.

1511
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:10,806
Nobody will ever see mine,
I'm too vain.

1512
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,745
I'll wonder what
you will look like
in years to come.

1513
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:20,449
You'll probably
turn all silver.

1514
01:25:23,519 --> 01:25:25,888
Never felt for anyone
the way I feel
about you, Jean.

1515
01:25:28,524 --> 01:25:29,592
You have.

1516
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:30,826
You've forgotten.

1517
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:33,629
You felt it with Carol.

1518
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,264
I felt it with Roger.

1519
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:39,168
When we first met,

1520
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,870
we were consumed with passion.

1521
01:25:43,406 --> 01:25:45,574
Every chance we got,
every place we could think of,

1522
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:47,343
we couldn't get enough
of each other.

1523
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:50,846
And then, as time passed...

1524
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:54,917
Things got more familiar,

1525
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,886
a little less exciting.

1526
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,488
We're still physical,

1527
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:02,258
but maybe not as much.

1528
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:06,229
So, things change,

1529
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:07,863
they turn to touching...

1530
01:26:12,335 --> 01:26:13,836
Little kisses.

1531
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:18,173
The quiet things.

1532
01:26:21,744 --> 01:26:23,346
So maybe they are...

1533
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:26,649
Different from
when we first met,

1534
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,685
but in the beginning
it was passionate,

1535
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:31,387
way beyond the movies.

1536
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,660
Our problem
is our memory.

1537
01:26:38,761 --> 01:26:40,629
We forgot, didn't we, Tom?

1538
01:26:40,663 --> 01:26:42,865
We forgot what we really had.

1539
01:26:42,898 --> 01:26:44,667
When it's not
in front of us...

1540
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:49,838
We forget that
it was really there,
but it was.

1541
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:55,278
We just have to find a way
to get it back again.

1542
01:26:59,915 --> 01:27:01,884
You and I never made love...

1543
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:07,723
But I really don't remember
if we did or not.

1544
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,467
I wanted to give
you something,

1545
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,503
a present,
so you wouldn't forget me.

1546
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:23,739
I don't need
a present for that.

1547
01:27:25,474 --> 01:27:29,345
-When are you leaving?
-Next Saturday.

1548
01:27:29,378 --> 01:27:31,280
You'll like Seattle.
Things grow well in Seattle.

1549
01:27:31,314 --> 01:27:32,748
They have all that wonderful
rain there.

1550
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:34,517
-I've got to go.
-Please.

1551
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,873
I'm going to turn
and walk away,

1552
01:27:57,906 --> 01:27:59,908
and when I go,
I'm not gonna
look back at you.

1553
01:28:01,644 --> 01:28:03,746
Cause I can't look
at you one more time.

1554
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:20,829
I love you, Jean.

I told you I'd do it.

Yeah, well, I was
just sitting here,

it's got to be pretty easy.

01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:51,920
None of that phony
macho stuff for me,

1566
01:29:51,954 --> 01:29:53,388
so I tried to thread
the needle.

1567
01:29:53,422 --> 01:29:56,625
And I've been
trying to thread this needle
for the last ten minutes.

1568
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:03,165
Oh.
(SCOFFS)

1569
01:30:07,803 --> 01:30:09,538
-You're staring at me.
-Mmm-hmm.

1570
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:15,010
I missed you.

1571
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,881
You missed me?
(LAUGHS)

1572
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,949
How could you miss me?
We are together every day.

1573
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:24,887
I was gone for a little while,
but now I'm back.

1574
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:34,697
(SIGHS)

1575
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:40,469
-Give me those pants.
-Yeah?

1576
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:43,071
No, not those pants!

1577
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,607
Give me those pants.

1578
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,974
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1579
01:30:48,611 --> 01:30:49,678
ROGER: Got ya.
