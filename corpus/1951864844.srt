There are no secrets between us, Dutch.
You know that.

163

Ryan Chambers is hosting it for us.

164
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,589
I'm sorry.
We go to church on Sunday.

165
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,929

- I'm not goin'.
- Why not?

- I just can't.
- Dutch.

I can't believe you did that today.

There you go. Faith won't pay the bills.

217

What does that have
to do with you joining church?

218
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:11,336
Do we have to talk
about this now, here?

219
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,931
You don't want me to embarrass you
in front of your little friends?

220
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:16,533
Yeah, that's right.
Can we drop it please?

221
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:20,138
All right, I'll leave it alone.
I won't say nothin' else about it.

- <i>[Dutch] Hey, Monica. How you doin'?</i>
- That <i>is</i> you. Mmm!

00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:30,449
- This is Val, my beautiful wife.
- I'm so glad to finally get to meet you, Val.

224
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:33,926
It's nice to meet you too. Dutch is always
telling me about the good times...

225
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:36,486
you, Ryan and Kevin
had back in school.

226
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:40,125
Well, we used to say, " A party ain't
a party until Dutch Mass shows up."

227
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,362
Oh? Well, happy anniversary to you.

228
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,530
Fifteen years of heaven and hell.

- There's my husband.
- [Kissing Noises]

- Hi, baby.
- Hey. What's happenin', man?

232
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:54,775
- Good to see you, man. This is Val.
- Good to see you.

233
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:57,340
Hello, Val.
Great to meet you.

234
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,852
We had to work very hard
to get your husband up here...

235
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:03,152
but, uh, Atlanta's loss
is definitely Philly's gain.

236
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:06,022
I like that color on you.
Takes a real man to pull that off.

- <i>Thanks.</i>

those orders, Doctor.

246
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,382
Perfect. Then I'll teach you.
Do you mind, Val?

247

No, no, no.

- This is Cynda. She works for me.
- Pleasure to meet you.

252

- You too.
- Why don't you go get me
a drink for 10 minutes, okay?

- The usual?
- The usual.

- I'm a photographer.

My favorite image
is the lion attacking. You?

00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:12,749
I don't really have a favorite part.

260
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,768
I guess I like the whole thing.

I'm sorry, Ryan.

off your last album.

There's a lot of songs on that album.

Yeah. The scholar,
the baller and the flirt.

is how to-within our faith- deal with
spousal cheating in a constructive way.

Yes, Miss Gladys.

356

Greg's my guest.

He didn't want to come, but I insisted.
I told him that he would be more than welcome.

- Boyfriend.

- Oh, help us, Jesus.
- If my presence offends anybody, I'll go.

384

Nobody said anything
about being offended.

<i>Explain to me...</i>

00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:15,601
how you went into that hotel room
with a loaded gun...

969
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:19,736
and you saw your husband
in that situation and nothing happened.

970
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:25,440
Nothin' happened?

971
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:28,710
Nothin' happened?

972
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:32,414
Detective Hicks...

973
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:35,826
the end of my life happened.

974
00:57:37,463 --> 00:57:41,229
Everything I believed in... died.

975
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:46,471
My future, my family...

976
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,404
my faith, my hope...

977
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:54,304
died in that moment.

You can sit over there
and say to me...

979
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,011
nothin' happened?

980
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:16,292
And that was the last time
you saw that gun?

981
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,803
- Yes.

00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:21,328
I got a question for you.

And I want you
to answer it honestly.

991
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,083
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, baby.

992
00:59:44,157 --> 00:59:46,455

993
00:59:48,094 --> 00:59:50,085
Mm-hmm.

01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:06,064
I'm telling you,
I never saw Ryan that way.

1028

And usually my gay-dar is on point.

1029
01:02:08,034 --> 01:02:11,003
I have always suspected
Ryan "the Secret" Chambers.

1030
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,504
Why didn't Dutch just
say he was bisexual?

1031
01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:18,169
Because he's not necessarily bisexual
or gay, at least not if you ask him.

1032
01:02:18,244 --> 01:02:20,542
<i>He's just D.L.- down low.</i>

1033
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:23,446
How long would you have stayed
with Dutch if you knew...

1034
01:02:23,516 --> 01:02:26,212
he had a thing for men?

1035
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,651
One date, half a date.

1036
01:02:28,721 --> 01:02:31,315
How you think straight black men
would react to him if he came out?

1037
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,984
What about his practice?
This is not an easy thing.

1038
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,029
You shouldn't feel like you're
the only woman who ever went through this.

1039
01:02:37,096 --> 01:02:39,929
- It's not that uncommon.
- Oh, I know that's right.

1040
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:43,162
Hmm. There are a whole lot

- As a matter of fact, I think

01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:10,353
- Oh, really.
- Yeah, you should let me blow it out for you.

01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:12,446
Hey, Dad.

01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:16,425
Oh, hey, Son. Why don't you

Hello, Reverend Dunn, Sister Dunn.

1054
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,123
What y'all doing here?

1055
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,395
<i>[Reverend]</i>
<i>Just thought we'd put a few things in order.</i>

1056
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:02,405
No huggin'. No preachin'.

1057
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:04,703
Someone told me a story
once about a blind girl...

1058
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:08,905
who hated herself just
because she was blind.

1059
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:12,642
She hated everyone,
except her loving boyfriend.

1060
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:17,153
He was always there for her. She said
that if she could only see the world...

1061
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:19,121
she would marry her boyfriend.

1062
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,785
One day, someone donated
a pair of eyes to her.

1063
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,125
Then she could see everything,
including her boyfriend.

1064
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:28,859
<i>He asked her,</i>
<i>"Now that you can see the world...</i>

1065
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:31,094
will you marry me?"

1066
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,535
The girl was shocked when
she saw that he was blind, too...

1067
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:37,802
and refused to marry him.

1068
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,810
Her boyfriend walked away in tears.

1069
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:44,575
And later wrote a letter
to her saying...

1070
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:47,048
"Just take care of my eyes, dear."

1071
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,585
Hmph.

1072
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:52,520
Who am I supposed to be,
the blind girl?

1073
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:56,686
- You were the blind girl.
- Can a blind girl get a drink?

1074
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:04,966
Don't preach at me.
I already been saved.

1075
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:09,665
I am a saved woman.
I have prayed and I have prayed.

1076
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:13,574
You see these scars on my knees?
That's from praying.

1077
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:17,307
Valerie, once you start feeling sorry
for yourself, you give away your power.

1078
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:20,248
What power?
God ain't listening to me.

1079
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:23,081
Stop giving Satan the glory.

1080
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,849
I have been everything
God asked me to be.

1081
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:29,518
I have been a good wife.
I have been a good mother.

1082
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,790
Every Sunday I make sure
I'm in somebody's church.

1083
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:35,491
And I take my family with me.

1084
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,466
<i>I saved myself for my husband.</i>

1085
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,231
<i>I saved my body for my husband.</i>
<i>And I have never...</i>

1086
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,238
ever, ever thought
about cheating on him.

1087
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:47,005
And I did these things not only because
I loved Dutch, but because I loved God.

1088
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:50,205
You think you're the first woman
who's ever been betrayed by her husband?

1089
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:53,250
I wasn't just betrayed
by my husband.

1090
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,615
I was betrayed by God.

1091
01:05:55,686 --> 01:05:59,747
God didn't betray you, baby.
As Christians, we all have our cross to bear.

1092
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:03,418
Jesus is bearing the cross.
You gonna make him bear it alone?

1093
01:06:03,494 --> 01:06:05,485
It was a man.

1094
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,689
It was a man!

1095
01:06:08,766 --> 01:06:10,859
It would be one thing
if it was a woman.

1096
01:06:10,935 --> 01:06:13,768
I could do something about that!
I could compete with that.

1097
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:17,534
Fix myself up, look cute in his eyes,
make myself beautiful for him.

1098
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:20,543
But it's a man he wants!
A man!

1099
01:06:21,612 --> 01:06:23,773
In the name of Jesus Christ,
Valerie.

1100
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:29,251
Women who struggled through
heartbreak, pain, slavery-

1101
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,153
And they did not do so
to see it come to this.

1102
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,156
Rise up, Valerie.

1103
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,317
Because someone is watching you.

1104
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:38,384
And that somebody is your daughter.

1105
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,625
And it's not the betrayal
that's important, Valerie.

1106
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:43,758
It's the lesson you learn from it.

1107
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,893
- I can't. [Crying]
- Yes, you can, Valerie.

1108
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,996
- Please, leave me alone. Please!
- Get up, Valerie.

1109
01:06:49,073 --> 01:06:51,166
Give God the glory.
Get up!

1110
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,300
Take back your power.

1111
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,641
<i>Mommy, are you okay?</i>

1112
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:01,980
God loves you.

1113
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,614
Yes, baby, Mommy's okay.

1114
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,660
Remember what you told me
to do every day?

1115
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:20,259
Come on, Mommy.

1116
01:07:23,674 --> 01:07:26,666
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1117
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:29,679
He maketh me to lay down
in green pastures...

1118
01:07:29,747 --> 01:07:34,343
<i>he restoreth my soul, he leads me</i>
<i>in the path of righteousness...</i>

1119
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:36,352
[Both]
for his name's sake.

1120
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,947
<i>Yea, though I walk...</i>

1121
01:07:40,024 --> 01:07:43,187
through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1122
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,229
I will fear no evil...

1123
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:48,890
for thou art with me;

1124
01:07:48,966 --> 01:07:52,868
thy rod and thy staff...

1125
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:55,097
they comfort me.

1126
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:58,164
Thou preparest a table before me...

1127
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:01,302
[Alone]
in the presence of mine enemies.

1128
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,040
Thou annointest my head with oil;

1129
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:06,981
my cup runneth over.

1130
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:11,317
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life...

1131
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:16,323
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

1132
01:08:18,629 --> 01:08:21,325
- <i>Your husband sleeps with mens?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

1133
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:24,265
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!

1134
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,268
Ms. Honeycomb, let's be mindful.

1135
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:29,999
<i>I know I shouldn't say this,</i>
<i>but I would have slit his lying throat.</i>

1136
01:08:30,074 --> 01:08:33,771
- <i>Sorry, Sister Dunn, but I would have.</i>
- Greg, no disrespect...

1137
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:37,712
- <i>but I thinks all you gay, lowdown-</i>
- Mm-hmm.

1138
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,341
Down-loaded men is bringing that...

1139
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:44,114
white homosexual disease
into our community.

1140
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:48,215
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Spreadin' that Al DS and not tellin' nobody.

1141
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:52,786
<i>It's a sin and a shame. And I had to</i>
<i>get it off my chest or else I'll bust.</i>

1142
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,956
- Sister Honeycomb-
- You interruptin' her.

1143
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:58,229
I'm afraid for my daughters.
I'm afraid for my granddaughters.

1144
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:01,567
<i>Lord, I'm afraid for 'em all,</i>
<i>and I'm sorry.</i>

1145
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:05,734
But it's your fault
for all your secrets and disease.

1146
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,243
- So what are you saying about my son?
- <i>[Dunn] Ladies!</i>

1147
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:12,976
<i>First of all, it's not "down-loaded, '"</i>
<i>it's "down low. '"</i>

1148
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,745
<i>Whatever.</i>

1149
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,219
- Secondly, I'm a homosexual man,
and I'm proud of that...
- <i>Oh, Lord!</i>

1150
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:21,780
<i>'cause I'm not keeping any secrets</i>
<i>from anybody- trust me.</i>

1151
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:26,922
<i>It's impossible for</i> any <i>woman</i>
<i>to get</i> anything <i>from me.</i>

1152
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,658
- That's not the point.
- Sure ain't.

1153
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,565
I don't condone what these men are doing!
I agree with you!

1154
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:35,401
But can you realistically
expect anybody...

1155
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:39,169
to confess anything
or to come out...

1156
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:41,609
if they know this is the reception
they're gonna receive...

1157
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,646
this is how they're
gonna be treated?

1158
01:09:43,714 --> 01:09:46,410
What about the way they treatin'
our daughters and our granddaughters?

1159
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:48,747
I'm not touching your daughters
or granddaughters. Ew!

1160
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:53,085
<i>My son might be gay,</i>
<i>but I love him and he loves me.</i>

1161
01:09:53,157 --> 01:09:57,287
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean? I'm talking about my son.

1162
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,352
We are talking about Greg.

1163
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:02,159
I thought we were supposed to be
talking about Val's problems?

1164
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:06,328
<i>That's right, ladies. We</i> are <i>supposed</i>
<i>to be talking about Val's problems.</i>

1165
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:09,304
We <i>are</i> talking about
Val's problems. Right, Val?

1166
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:11,466
- Well, l-
- <i>We sure are.</i>

1167
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,602
- Heavenly Father.
- <i>[Greg] Listen.</i>

1168
01:10:14,678 --> 01:10:18,170
Down-low men are only part
of this problem.

1169
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:20,307
- A major part if you ask me.
- Mm-hmm.

1170
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,682
- Oh, really? What about prostitution?
- [Gasps]

1171
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:27,486
Sharing drug needles?
Straight men going to Thailand and Brazil...

1172
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:30,994
<i>on business trips</i>
<i>bringing H.I. V. and-</i>

1173

<i>and other things back to their wives</i>
<i>and their girlfriends?</i>

1174
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:37,398
- We're all guilty about something.
- That's right.

1175
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:42,530
<i>And by the way, I love God just</i>
<i>as much as you do.</i>

1176
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:46,167
- But does he love you?
- Sister Honeycomb!

1177
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:48,803
Look. God loves me and my son.

1178
01:10:48,879 --> 01:10:51,848
- Would you be quiet?
- Who you tellin' to be quiet, Boo?

1179
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,850
- [Shouting]
- Mrs. Persons, would you please sit down!

1180
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,716
- <i>We are in church! We're in the house of the Lord.</i>
- Yes.

1181
01:10:57,788 --> 01:11:01,918
<i>Now, let's all look to God</i>
<i>and pray together...</i>

1182
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:06,486
that he will help Val through
this terrible trial and be healed.

1183
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:09,930
<i>Now let's join hands</i>
<i>and bow our heads.</i>

1184
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,335
Charlotte.

1185
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:19,909
- Yeah.
- How did you know about my husband?

1186
01:11:19,977 --> 01:11:23,970
I've been where you are.
My husband lives on the D.L., too...

1187
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:26,515
but when you're
a famous entertainer...

1188
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:29,347
<i>people cut you a lot of slack.</i>

1189
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:32,911
- You're Ryan's wife.
- We're legally separated.

1190
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,049
We have nothing together now.

1191
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:41,526
Well, I just want
to say... thank you.

1192
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,465
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
<i>I don't know how I'm gonna repay you.</i>

1193
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:47,867
- For what?
- Opening my eyes.

1194
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:54,376
It was difficult to find out that my marriage
has been a lie for all these years.

1195
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:59,047
But I guess when you don't know
the truth, you can't make a choice.

1196
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:03,450
The important thing
to remember, Val, is...

1197
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,852
they can't win by
telling the truth...

1198
01:12:07,925 --> 01:12:10,792
and we can't lose
by telling the truth.

1199
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:24,538
<i>So what's happening, baby?</i>
<i>You coming back to me? Is that it?</i>

1200
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,542
- No.
- No?

1201
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:30,273
- I'm ending it with you too.
- So, you're a leopard who
is gonna change his spots...

1202
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:32,474
'cause he doesn't wanna
be a leopard anymore?

1203
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:35,814
- You're D.L. all the way, baby.
You're gonna be back.
- Yeah?

1204
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:38,411
- Can't have your cake and eat it too. Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1205
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:42,219
- Your marriage is proof of that.
- I think your marriage is proof of that.

1206
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:45,625
You know, Monica and I got our thing together.
We have an arrangement.

1207
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:48,221
- It's what's called an "arrangement."
- Oh, arrangement.

1208
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:51,961
I told you that you need
to come clean with your girl, Val.

1209
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:54,265
- You really do.
- What you doin'?

1210
01:12:54,338 --> 01:12:56,806
- I'm straightening up your tie. I like that tie.
- What are you doing?

1211
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,807
Well, like it from a distance.
What you doin'?

1212
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,469
- I'm not playing with you, man.
- I'm not playing with you.

1213
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:04,537
It's over.

1214
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:08,106
<i>Oh, okay. It's over.</i>
<i>So you're gonna walk away just like that?</i>

1215
01:13:08,185 --> 01:13:12,781
Well, I'm gonna be right here when you come
back, baby, because Kevin knows who he is.

1216
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:15,188
Everyone knows who Kevin is.

1217
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:17,556
I am free. Kevin is free.

1218
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:21,393
<i>'Cause you're D. L!</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1219
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:24,992
Are you gonna change your spots?
You can't change your spots!

1220
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:29,505
<i>You are nothin', baby.</i>
<i>Look at him! Look at him! He's a faggot!</i>

1221
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:33,532
<i>He's a big-time punk!</i>
<i>Sissy.</i>

1222
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:42,284
<i>Coming clean after I caught you</i>
<i>red-handed really doesn't mean that much.</i>

1223
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:48,054
Yeah, but now there's-
there's no more secrets between us.

1224
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:55,697
I love you, Val. We're supposed to
be together. I don't want you to leave.

1225
01:13:55,766 --> 01:14:00,863
You think you can do what you've done- live
a double life- and it's all supposed to go away?

1226
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,837
Why, Dutch, why?
Why you think that?

1227
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,739
- 'Cause you're cryin'?
- <i>I can change.</i>

1228
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:08,209
Val, I can change. I swear.

1229
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:12,339
- <i>I swear to God I can change.</i>
- I'm sorry, Dutch.

1230
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:15,010
I filed for divorce.

<i>[Sniffles]</i>
<i>This is what I get?</i>

This is what I get for being honest?

1233
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:26,253
Val, I can't stand the thought
of losing you and Nicole. I need you.

1234
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:30,265
- Baby, you can't walk out on me.
- You walked out on me...

1235
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,301
again and again and again.

1236
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:36,533
Admit it.
You must have hated them-

01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,904
both Dutch and Ryan.

1238
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,909
- <i>I would have.</i>
- Hated them?

1239
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,639
I wouldn't say hate.
I wouldn't say that.

1240
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:46,181
After a betrayal like that?

1241
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:49,776
Oh. I know you're a good Christian
and all of that.

1242
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:53,448
- But a jury is gonna have a hard time believing-
- Detective.

1243
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:55,548
I can assure you
that on that jury...

01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,423
they will contain a number of good Christians
who won't have trouble believing.

Time is up.

- Make it fast.

01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:35,910
You know, I've been struggling with this.

1447
01:29:38,884 --> 01:29:40,852
Was I the friend
you needed me to be?

1448
01:29:40,919 --> 01:29:43,911
Was I the wife you needed me to be?

1449
01:29:43,989 --> 01:29:47,755
Was I the Christian
you needed me to be?

1450
01:29:50,529 --> 01:29:54,158
And... could you have stopped?

1451
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,104
Could you?

1452
01:30:05,277 --> 01:30:07,404
I don't know.

1453
01:30:14,986 --> 01:30:16,977
I love you, Dutch.

1454
01:30:21,593 --> 01:30:25,552
But I can't...
trust you anymore.

1455
01:30:52,324 --> 01:30:54,986
- Daddy!
- <i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

1456
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:00,421
Oh!

1457
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,362
I love you.

1458
01:31:04,436 --> 01:31:06,427
I love you more.

1459
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:12,768
My beautiful girl.

1460
01:31:14,913 --> 01:31:16,676
- Be good. Okay?
- Okay.

1461
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:19,547
Okay, go to Mama.

1462
01:31:34,766 --> 01:31:36,757
All right.

1463
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:44,765
I love you, Son.

<i>[Knocking]</i>

1465
01:32:53,111 --> 01:32:55,671
Are you showing the house?

1466
01:32:57,849 --> 01:33:01,307
Not now. Uh, the Realtor
will be here tomorrow.

1467
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:03,479
Why don't you come back then?

1468
01:33:03,555 --> 01:33:05,614
You hear that, baby?

1469
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:09,148
We might have just found
the house of our dreams.

1470
01:33:09,227 --> 01:33:12,788
Hey, um, you mind
if I look around inside?

1471
01:33:12,864 --> 01:33:16,823
It's dusty around here. You look like
you got something in your eye.

1472
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:19,426
What did you say?

1473
01:33:19,504 --> 01:33:23,565
I think you got something in your eye.
You want me to blow it out for you?

1474
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:32,072
Hey.

1475
01:33:33,652 --> 01:33:36,519
We'll come back
and look another day, okay?
