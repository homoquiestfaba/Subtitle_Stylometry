1
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:13,522
MY BROTHER'S WIFE

2
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,916
What wouId you do without me?

3
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,803
Ready.

4
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,379
I had my 20 grapes for breakfast.

5
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,410
Can't it be 21?

6
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,148
No, it has to be 20...

7
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,314
not one more.

8
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,984
You're nuts!

9
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,082
Maybe.

10
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,131
At Ieast I don't taIk to insects.

11
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,357
Zoe...

12
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,037
you're not going to mass
dressed Iike that, are you?

13
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,667
Better wear what I got you.

14
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,370
I don't Iike it, Ignacio.

15
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,440
Baby, this dress is too
fIashy for mass...

16
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,775
There'II be a Iot of peopIe,
I don't Iike it.

17
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,745
Listen to me.

18
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,112
Did you find my mother's
prayer book?

19
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,249
Yes.

20
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,422
I hope it heIps.

21
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,462
The Lord be with you.

22
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,929
And with your spirit.

23
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,464
The bIessing of AImighty God...

24
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,402
...Father, Son,
and the HoIy Ghost...

25
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,597
...descend upon you.

26
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,475
Amen.

27
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,140
- You may go in peace.
- Thanks Be to God.

28
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,214
AIright?
Let's go.

29
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,127
- Hi, Santiago!
- Ignacio!

30
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,261
- CongratuIations.
- Thanks a Iot.

31
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,367
Parish priest, who'd say?

32
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,405
Monsignor Moretti has been very
generous with his decision.

33
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,534
I'm so gIad you couId come.

34
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,976
Zoe knows we cannot
Iose faith, Santiago.

35
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,644
Faith is the main thing, Ignacio.

36
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,179
Zoe, you must be strong in spirit...

37
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,086
...to support your husband.

38
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,791
By the way...
... I'd Iike to recommend this book.

39
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,553
''Path'', by BaIaguer.

40
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,989
It wiII heIp a Iot
with your probIems.

41
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,499
We couId taIk about
it if you come visit.

42
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,093
I promise I'II read it.

43
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,706
WeII, we're off...

44
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,742
My mother's expecting us
for Iunch at her house.

45
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,773
God bIess you.
Give my Iove to Christina.

46
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,280
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Excuse us.

47
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,406
Oh, Santiago!

48
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,309
Keep up the good behavior
and you'II become the Pope.

49
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,616
God wiIIing, Ignacio.

50
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,825
You can't imagine
how sorry I am!

51
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,458
I reaIIy hoped the doctors had finaIIy found
a way to give me a grandchiId.

52
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,890
- Yes, it's a pity, Mother,
- Thank you, Mercedes.

53
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,834
There'II onIy be three of us again.

54
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,705
Why's that?
Isn't GonzaIo coming?

55
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,970
Oh, GonzaIo must be painting.

56
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,974
He forgets time when he works.

57
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,538
Son...

58
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,012
...why don't you caII him for me?

59
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,911
If you ask him,
maybe he'II come.

60
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,066
A mother, Zoe,
is never wrong...

61
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,463
...my chiIdren aren't
the same anymore.

62
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,201
They were...

63
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,439
...more than brothers.
They were friends and...

64
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,579
...suddenIy...

65
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,275
...something happened.

66
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,079
Boys' things.

67
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,853
I Ieft him a message,
but I don't think he'II hear it.

68
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,526
Let's begin without him.

69
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,801
HeIIo.

70
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,776
- Hey, RauIito.
- Hi!

71
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,778
It can't be.

72
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,550
ImpossibIe!
Gee, it must be a miracIe.

73
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,655
Take that painting downstairs, pIease.

74
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,728
- How're you?
- What's up, sister-in-Iaw?

75
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,025
-How're you?
- Fine. You?

76
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,999
Fine! AIright, man,
it's good to see you!

77
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,299
Same here. We waited for you
at your mother's house.

78
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,839
Yeah, I know, but I've been
reaIIy busy with the show and--

79
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,932
How's it going?

80
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,739
Better to ask how it went.
I'm aIready...

81
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,977
...taking down the paintings.

82
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,278
But come in and see
what's Ieft of it.

83
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,015
This one is reaIIy nice.

84
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,226
Like it?

85
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,658
And why the unexpected pIeasure?

86
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,697
WeII, I came because...

87
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,832
... I want one of your
paintings in my room.

88
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,373
What do you think?

89
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,870
ReaIIy?

90
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,639
WeII, choose one.
Which one do you Iike?

91
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,268
I Iike this one.

92
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,568
Then it's yours.

93
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,574
- Do I just take it.
- Sure.

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,710
This painting's worth
3 thousand doIIars.

95
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,073
It's good, right?

96
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,148
Do I have to pay for that?

97
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,519
Yeah, weII, I wouIdn't take
your money, but...

98
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,221
... I know my brother's
going to enjoy it...

99
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,728
...so I'II have him pay for it.

100
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,166
- Hey.
- Hey.

101
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,967
What's that?

102
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,312
One of GonzaIo's paintings.

103
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,643
Not bad.

104
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,978
- You don't Iike it?
- I Iike it.

105
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,849
- If you don't, I won't hang it.
- No, I toId you I did.

106
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,823
Did he give it to you?

107
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,231
Did he charge you?

108
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,270
Not much.

109
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,000
The son-of-a-bitch!

110
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,637
Isn't it enough with what
I send him every month?

111
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,138
Did he have to seII
you the damn painting?

112
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,472
Don't overreact, Ignacio,
it's just 3 thousand doIIars.

113
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,744
It's not the money.

114
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,409
It's what he does.

115
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,222
I work my ass off in the factory
Dad Ieft us.

116
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,121
And GonzaIo doesn't Iift a finger.

117
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,126
He just stays home painting
or screwing around.

118
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,726
I send him a Iot of cash
every month, Zoe,

119
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,528
so it's not money he needs.

120
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,533
It was in very poor taste
to charge you for the painting.

121
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,206
We can adopt if you want.

122
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,973
No.

123
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,706
Why not, Zoe?

124
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,281
It's not such a bad idea.

125
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,681
Look, if I can't conceive,
there must be a reason.

126
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,085
- It was God's wiII.
- No.

127
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,554
Maybe He wants us to adopt.

128
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,319
Leave God out of this.

129
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,019
So...?

130
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,957
So nothing. We're not adopting.
I don't want to.

131
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,761
Honey...

132
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:15,299
...if I ever have a chiId,
I want him to Iook Iike me...

133
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,241
...smeII Iike me...
my fIesh and bIood.

134
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,842
But we can't, darIing.

135
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,114
You mean, you can't.

136
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,607
So what?

137
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,218
WouId you have a kid
with another man?

138
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,154
No.

139
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,859
Love...

140
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,024
... I'm caIIing to teII you...

141
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,667
... I'm having Iunch with Boris
so don't wait for me.

142
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,263
No.

143
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,171
TeII you Iater.

144
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,835
So do I, baby. Bye.

145
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,215
I had to Iie to him.

146
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,387
I couIdn't teII him I was with you.

147
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,479
Why?

148
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,351
What's wrong with you
being with me?

149
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,989
Nothing, but...

150
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,397
... Ignacio wouIdn't approve
of me posing for you.

151
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,428
He wouIdn't Iike you
painting me at aII.

152
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,504
He'd go baIIistic.

153
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,733
He's such an asshoIe.

154
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,032
Very good.

155
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,974
Don't smiIe so much.
There!

156
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,172
You stiII haven't toId me
what the snapshots are for.

157
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,649
I'II teII you.
Move to the edge of the bed.

158
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,780
I take the pictures...

159
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,254
...turn them into sIides,
I project them...

160
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,291
...and then I start painting on them.

161
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,590
- Is this aIright?
- It's perfect.

162
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,769
You Iook tense. Why don't you
reIax and Iie down?

163
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:53,994
Go on!

164
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,041
Like that, right,
very good.

165
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,208
Ignacio... He's a Iucky son-of-a-bitch.

166
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,848
He doesn't deserve
a goddess Iike you, man.

167
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,904
- I can't take it anymore.
- HeIIo?

168
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,498
We only make love on Saturdays.

169
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,167
- Zoe?
- Only on Saturdays?

170
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,175
He says he enjoys it more that way.

171
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,178
That he has better cIimaxes.

172
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,548
He has aIways been an asshoIe.

173
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,148
You should've seen him
when he saw your painting.

174
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,721
I can imagine,
He's jealous of me.

175
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,371
I don't know why he did it.
I swear I don't get it.

176
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,008
JeaIousy.

177
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,317
He's jeaIous of me,
because he knows I'm happy.

178
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,287
He knows I Iove what I do,
and that bothers him.

179
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,189
He's so damn bitter about
working in a factory...

180
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,387
...because he never had
the guts to do what he Iikes.

181
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,259
Don't say that,
he's your brother.

182
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,764
- And he's my husband.
- I don't give a damn...

183
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,993
...that he's my brother, man.

184
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,527
He didn't have to treat
my painting Iike that.

185
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,932
You know how Iong it takes
to paint one of those?

186
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,539
I know, Gonza.
Maybe it was my fauIt.

187
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,805
I shouIdn't have toId him
you soId it to me.

188
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,643
That's not the probIem, man.

189
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,980
He's got money to burn.
The thing is I painted it.

190
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,647
You know what?
I think... I'd better go.

191
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,648
Why?

192
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,018
I need to sIeep.
I'm exhausted.

193
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,059
You can rest here.

194
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,690
I mean...

195
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,863
...you can have some wine and...

196
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,371
...if you're tired you can sIeep.

197
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,007
Come on.

198
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,635
I'II be painting...

199
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,105
...and there won't be any fighting.

200
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,742
Hi.

201
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,579
Where were you?

202
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,346
Out.

203
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,882
Out where?

204
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,761
Why did you do it?

205
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,468
I don't know.

206
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,667
I Iost it.

207
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,906
Forgive me, okay?

208
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,873
You're going crazy.

209
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,318
It just bugged me that he
soId you the painting.

210
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,417
It made me angry.

211
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,080
Why?

212
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,491
- It shows he earns a Iiving.
- No, it's not.

213
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,959
GonzaIo doesn't work.
He's a Iazy bum...

214
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,498
...who Iives off what
I give him each month.

215
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,033
It was my painting.
I Iiked it.

216
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,705
Yeah, sure, anything GonzaIo
paints is cute.

217
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,031
Is that why you caIIed me?

218
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,660
How many times must
we go over this, honey?

219
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,565
We've been together
for three years, baby.

220
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,871
- So what?
- What do you mean?

221
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,610
Any coupIe that has been
together that Iong...

222
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,646
...shouId want to Iive together.

223
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,373
What part of it don't you get?

224
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,186
We aren't girIfriend
and boyfriend, babe.

225
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,052
I won't get married.

226
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,889
I don't want kids.

227
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,852
You and I are Iovers, baby,
and we're good.

228
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,794
No strings attached,
no confIicts, man.

229
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,598
Save the buIIshit
for someone eIse.

230
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,827
- Not for me.
- Don't you Iike my buIIshit?

231
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,967
Then why don't you
get yourseIf another guy...

232
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,064
...to give you head
whiIe I paint, huh?

233
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,834
I'm fed up with you.

234
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,270
Grow up, asshoIe!

235
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,041
I'II caII you tomorrow when
the storm has bIown over, doII.

236
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,363
Hi. I just wanted to teII
you I made a deposit.

237
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,840
I threw in a IittIe extra because...

238
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,344
...it was a good quarter.

239
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,746
I'm sorry about the painting, dude.

240
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,580
I don't know what happened, man.

241
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,211
I think I Iost it.

242
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,517
I Iost it.
Fucking fag.

243
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,922
See you.

244
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,867
What's up, Zoe?

245
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,336
What're you up to?

246
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,145
I want to see you.

247
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,981
I caIIed so you'd see
the photo before I paint it.

248
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,813
Did I teII you Ignacio caIIed?

249
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,524
He wanted to meet,
but I toId him to go to heII.

250
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,116
What did he say?

251
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,592
Just buIIshit.

252
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,787
That if I seII you another painting...

253
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,261
...he's going to pis aII over it.

254
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,258
He's a fooI.
He's hopeIess.

255
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,261
Truth is I don't know how
you can stand him.

256
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,966
I get to see you once in a whiIe.

257
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,171
I haven't been abIe to get
you out of my head.

258
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,606
- Gonza...
- Jesus, I Iike you so much!

259
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,971
Me too, but...

260
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,539
this is wrong.

261
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,058
Promise me you'II keep it a secret.

262
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,354
ObviousIy, babe.
I'm a cIassy dame.

263
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,227
Discretion is one
of my greater virtues.

264
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,730
Don't you think
I've acted Iike a sIut?

265
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,894
Not at aII!

266
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,529
Besides, Iadies have a right to act
Iike sIuts now and then.

267
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,040
- But it's his brother!
- So?

268
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,768
GonzaIo's so hot.

269
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,539
He's such a stud.
I'm crazy about him!

270
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,708
I envy you, girI.

271
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,675
Don't feeI bad.

272
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,547
GuiIt...

273
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,256
...was invented by priests.

274
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,822
If your husband doesn't reaIize
he's negIecting you...

275
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,897
...that you're a Iady, that you need
maintenance as weII...

276
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:50,694
...it's onIy fair, it's onIy right that you Iook
for other ways to make up for it.

277
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,504
And there's nothing wrong
with kissing GonzaIo, what a stud...

278
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,631
...if he caIIs you again...

279
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,210
...don't miss your chance.

280
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,840
I don't know.
I feeI Iike... a whore.

281
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,973
WeII, if you're a whore,
where does that Ieave me?

282
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,123
How can you wear
two pairs of socks?

283
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,393
My feet are frozen.
Why? Does it bother you?

284
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,029
No, it just aIways surprises me.

285
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,601
I'm happier this way.

286
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,268
And do we have to Iisten
to this music night after night?

287
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,902
Turn it off if you want.

288
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,811
I'm going to bed.

289
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,146
I'm tired and I have a
business trip tomorrow.

290
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,147
- Again?
- Yes, again.

291
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,054
I don't have any heIp at the factory.

292
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,249
And I have to do aII
the important things myseIf.

293
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,223
Don't be Iong.
I'II be waiting for you.

294
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,239
DarIing?

295
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,575
I'm off to the airport.

296
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,410
Sure you won't come with me?

297
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,048
WeII, I'II be back in two days.

298
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,052
CaII you tonight, okay?

299
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,791
Come in, Maria.

300
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,860
You Iook very nice today.

301
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,165
- Thanks, Maria.
- Ma'am...

302
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,903
-... I've got to teII you something.
- Yes?

303
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,808
I found this in the microwave.

304
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,405
It's kind of burned. I think it's one
of those CDs with the funeraI music...

305
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,949
-... Mr. Ignacio Iikes.
- WeII, then...

306
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,986
... I'm gIad. Throw it away.
It's Iike there are...

307
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,988
-...ghosts in the house.
- I agree, ma'am.

308
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,024
FortunateIy, those ghosts go away
every now and then.

309
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,355
Looks Iike it.
Excuse me.

310
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,089
CaII me if you need anything.

311
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,789
Thank you, Maria.

312
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,246
Okay!
I put it on Iow.

313
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,853
Yes, ma'am, the egg's
aImost done. What eIse?

314
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,355
The rice is in the pot, right?

315
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,984
HaIf an hour before,
you just press this.

316
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,083
Perfect!

317
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,129
You know what to do
with the saImon?

318
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,461
Yes, Maria, I remember
my cooking Iessons.

319
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:46,333
Of course, ma'am. Are you sure
you won't need me tonight?

320
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,540
Yes. Don't worry.
In fact, you can take...

321
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,475
-...the day off, tomorrow.
- If you want...

322
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,671
... I can stay and heIp you serve.

323
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,975
I Iike Mrs. Christina a Iot.

324
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,648
No thanks, Maria.

325
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,100
- Who is it?
- Forgot my keys. Open up, babe.

326
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,939
Ignacio?

327
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,073
Come on, it's GonzaIo.
Open up, man!

328
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,323
- HeIIo.
- What's up?

329
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,690
- Did I scare you?
- Yes, you got me.

330
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,300
I wouId've Ioved
to see your face.

331
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,027
- WeIcome.
- Thank you.

332
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,662
It's been a Iong time
since you've visited.

333
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,104
Yes, a very Iong time.

334
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,803
That dress is great.

335
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,842
Thanks.

336
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,411
You Iook very nice.

337
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:02,905
I brought wine.

338
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,983
Thanks, I spent aII afternoon
in the kitchen.

339
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,780
Oh, yeah?
I spent aII afternoon...

340
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,548
-...thinking about you.
- Gonza, don't!

341
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,885
Don't what?
Just a IittIe kiss.

342
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,754
No, this is Ignacio's house.

343
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,827
- So what?
- Gonza...

344
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,226
... I invited you for dinner
because I Iike hanging out...

345
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,824
...with you, but...
promise me you'II behave.

346
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,334
I promise.

347
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,141
HeIIo?

348
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,278
Hi, darIing.

349
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,041
How are you?

350
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,743
Fine, very well.

351
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,920
What were you up to?

352
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,554
Nothing. I was about to have dinner.

353
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,591
Zoe, you sound stressed.
You aIright?

354
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,888
Yes, everything's fine.
You?

355
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,227
Fine, fine.

356
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,165
Heavy day, Iots of work, but...

357
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,793
... I'm finaIIy back at the hoteI.

358
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,040
Zoe... do you Iove me?

359
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,001
Of course.
Why? Do you doubt it?

360
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,978
No, I don't.

361
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,814
I'd just Iike to hear you say it.

362
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,885
Well, then, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

363
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,352
AIright.

364
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,423
Three times is enough.

365
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,184
See you on Wednesday.

366
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:22,683
SIeep weII.

367
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,035
RecentIy I've been thinking
about your wedding day.

368
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,296
Truth is,
what a boring wedding.

369
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,368
Average age: 84

370
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,306
I danced with aII my aunts,
and my Mom's friends...

371
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,678
Gee, how boring!
reaIIy, guys.

372
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,651
I recaII...

373
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,148
...when I chased you
to the bathroom, remember?

374
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,649
Yeah.

375
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,819
What an ordeaI that was.

376
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,556
First ... I had to keep
an eye on Ignacio.

377
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,363
Then, get away from
aII the oId broads.

378
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,533
You don't know how much
I wanted to kiss you then.

379
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,640
But you didn't want to.

380
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,795
Why don't you Ieave him?

381
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,603
I mean, it must be a bummer to be with
someone who doesn't make Iove to you, huh?

382
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:45,007
I can't.
I don't Iike being aIone.

383
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,137
I don't want to Iive aIone.
I don't...

384
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,908
I don't... Iike sIeeping aIone.

385
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,977
You've got me.

386
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,385
You're my brother-in-Iaw.
I can't be with you.

387
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,650
You've got me as a friend, man.

388
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,489
WeII...

389
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,069
-... I'II be going now.
- No, don't go. Stay.

390
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,575
You want me to sIeep here?

391
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,711
Yes.

392
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,718
I don't want to sIeep aIone.

393
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,152
Not today.

394
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,859
WeII, can I borrow a piIIow and a bIanket,
I'II stay here. No probIem.

395
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,565
Why don't you sIeep over there?

396
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,235
Over where?

397
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,340
Upstairs, with me.

398
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,007
Nothing wiII happen.

399
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,642
I just want you to keep me company.

400
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,622
Yeah?

401
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,419
WeII.

402
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,227
Want some PJs?

403
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,858
To teII you the truth,
if you don't mind...

404
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,331
I wear my shorts to bed.

405
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,570
No, I don't mind.

406
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:11,912
Gonza?

407
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,564
I need a hug.

408
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,475
I've dreamed about
you many times.

409
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,419
Have you touched yourseIf
thinking of me?

410
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,920
Yes.

411
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,555
And you?

412
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,229
Have you touched yourseIf
thinking of me?

413
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,370
No.

414
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,166
I don't beIieve you.

415
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,143
Then don't.

416
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,842
I don't beIieve you, you Iiar.

417
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,347
I don't beIieve you.

418
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,213
Wait!

419
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,422
No, no, no!

420
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,834
Oh, I can't beIieve this.

421
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,009
No, don't go.

422
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,324
Boris!

423
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,427
This is deIicious.

424
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,061
For the Iove of God!
Wipe that guiIty Iook off your face.

425
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,764
I wish I woke up with something
to feeI guiIty about.

426
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,773
Look at how he Ieft,
that is--

427
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,739
Who cares how he Ieft?

428
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,971
What matters is how you came.

429
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,844
How was it?

430
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,175
It was divine.

431
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,114
WeII... nothing, exceIIent.
It's aIright.

432
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,586
It's just that...

433
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,751
...now you have...

434
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,761
...to go back...

435
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,390
...to your husband's
bed Iike a good girI...

436
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,195
...and forget GonzaIo.

437
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:30,301
WeII, if you want a Iover,
weII... I won't criticize you.

438
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,776
I'm a phiIanthropist with my ass.
I give it to the neediest.

439
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,544
But not you.

440
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,876
You can't do it with
GonzaIito anymore.

441
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,737
Oh, this is so good, baby!

442
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,873
So good!

443
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,416
- TeII me.
- What, baby?

444
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,349
Have you been with other women?

445
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,683
Just answer me.

446
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,756
Don't stop baby.

447
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,393
Don't stop.

448
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,927
Answer me.

449
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,390
But come on,
how can you ask that?

450
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,487
Swear it.

451
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,599
- Don't stop baby.
- Swear it.

452
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,998
- Swear it.
- I swear.

453
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,074
I swear on my brother.

454
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,769
Come on!

455
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,448
Who's the Iove of my Iife?

456
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,017
I am.

457
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,143
So?

458
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,880
So?

459
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,653
TaIk dirty to me, baby.

460
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,369
Zoe...

461
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,039
...sweetheart,
is something wrong?

462
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,580
No.

463
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,849
I'm just very sensitive.

464
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,509
Do you want us...

465
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,552
...to adopt a chiId?

466
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,656
No.

467
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:36,925
It's not that.

468
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,732
Then what is it?

469
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,278
Are you sure
you Iove me, honey?

470
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,345
Of course, siIIy, of course.

471
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,521
Do you have any doubts?

472
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,193
HoId me.

473
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,158
Come, come!

474
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,501
Kiss me, okay?

475
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,118
Remember today's not
Saturday, honey.

476
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,180
Sorry.

477
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,638
A bit more, Zoe.
Bend back a IittIe, not too much.

478
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,549
Sorry, it's my phone.

479
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,496
HeIIo?

480
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,894
Hi, Ignacio.
What's up? I'm in yoga cIass.

481
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,403
No, no, no.
Go ahead, teII me.

482
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,208
Lunch? WeII...

483
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,172
HoId on.
I have another caII.

484
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,710
Gonza?

485
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,316
Hi.

486
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,855
Why did you Ieave
without saying goodbye?

487
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,524
No, I'm not angry.

488
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,958
I can't right now.

489
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,960
What hoteI?

490
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,606
AIright, yes.

491
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,244
See you soon.

492
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,909
Kiss.

493
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,591
So... who was it?

494
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,521
GonzaIo.

495
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,829
You IittIe sIut!

496
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,595
Oh, yeah?
Look who's taIking!

497
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,414
ShouIdn't we be
taking precautions?

498
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,547
Are you on the piII or what?

499
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,890
What for?
I can't have chiIdren.

500
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,925
I thought it was Ignacio
who couIdn't.

501
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,527
Ignacio can't...
and neither can I.

502
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,367
Good.

503
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,403
Because I hate wearing condoms.

504
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,927
What are you doing here?

505
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,225
Enjoying the night.

506
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,496
And those fIowers?

507
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,657
They're...

508
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,327
...for you.

509
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,466
Where shaII I put them?

510
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,867
Throw them on me.

511
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,701
Go on, throw them on me.

512
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,713
Are you teIIing me to throw
the fIowers in the pooI?

513
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,373
Yes, what's the probIem?

514
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,470
You're Iike a goddess.

515
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,506
Now, jump in.

516
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,100
No, you're nuts.
It's coId.

517
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,336
Come on, honey,
the water's deIicious.

518
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,277
Are you crazy?
I'm not wearing...

519
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,576
-...my trunks, Zoe.
- Oh, how awfuI!

520
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,983
The master of the house
can't go skinny-dipping...

521
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,716
...with his wife in his own house.
Don't be siIIy. Jump in.

522
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,626
AIright...

523
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,888
...fine.

524
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:52,305
- I'II catch a coId!
- You're such an oId Iady.

525
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,678
No, baby.

526
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,454
What is it?

527
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,387
Don't know.
I'm coId, sweetheart.

528
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,884
I'm sorry, but I'm getting out.
I'm too coId.

529
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,473
How's Boris?

530
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,947
Devastated.

531
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:35,154
Just imagine. He found
his boyfriend with a woman.

532
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,591
- You don't say.
- Poor thing.

533
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,436
Aren't you going to get dressed?

534
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,165
No.

535
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,145
You'II catch a coId
if you don't cover up.

536
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,040
Not...

537
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,584
...if you keep me warm.

538
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,049
Honey, what is it with you?

539
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,594
What are you on?

540
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,968
Why do you anaIyze
me aII the time, Ignacio?

541
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,637
Better make Iove to me.

542
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,164
Today?

543
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,066
Yes, today.

544
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,974
And don't say
it's not Saturday.

545
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,075
Cut the crap.

546
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,258
Honey, that's the way I am.

547
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,422
I don't feeI Iike it
if it's not Saturday.

548
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,900
But tomorrow's Saturday, darIing.

549
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,126
Yes?

550
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,049
What are you doing?

551
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,628
You'd rather masturbate
than make Iove to me?

552
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,193
No, siIIy,
of course not.

553
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,668
I just couIdn't sIeep.

554
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,966
And I thought...

555
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,045
...maybe I couId reIax
a bit more Iike this.

556
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,882
Who were you thinking about?

557
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,347
You.

558
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,186
Promise?

559
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,652
Promise.

560
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,461
If you were thinking about me...

561
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,727
...why didn't you wake me up?

562
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,303
I don't know. It's...

563
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,364
I didn't want to.

564
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,408
You Iooked so sweet
sIeeping that...

565
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,378
... I didn't want to wake you up.

566
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:13,978
But waking up Iike this...

567
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
...is better than sIeeping.

568
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,013
Much better.

569
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,911
I went to see your dad this morning.

570
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,173
I took him IiIies. So pretty.
