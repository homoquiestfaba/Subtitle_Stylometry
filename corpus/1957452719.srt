Normalcy?
Isn't the word "normality"?

But everybody says "normalcy",

138
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:40,291
so saying "normality"
would be an "abnormalcy."

139

But isn't the rule

140
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,828
that only words that end
in the letter "T"

141
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:47,665
- get a suffix that...
- No.

142
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,302
It's "normalcy",
because saying it is normal.

143
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:53,938
And normal is right. Right?

00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,282
<i>into something
perfectly different.</i>

180
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:46,950
Are you still in bed?

181
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:52,456
No.

182
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:57,328
[Japanese accent]
I have multiple things to do.

183
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,301
Multiple things?

184
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,572
The reason that Ashley woke up

185
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,874
with a Japanese accent
was unclear.

186
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:14,044
Wait, what? What did you say?

187
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,546
[chuckles]

188
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,181
All right.

189
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:20,517
<i>What was clear, however,</i>

190
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,921
<i>was that Larry could never
find out about this.</i>

191
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:07,498
<i>It was called
foreign accent syndrome,</i>

192
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,832
<i>a rare disorder</i>

193
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,567
<i>that could suddenly
and totally change</i>

194
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,102
<i>a speaker's voice.</i>

195
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,972
<i>And Ashley definitely had it.</i>

196
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:16,840
Hmm.

197
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:19,276
Probably.

198
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:21,678
[sighs] Well, your tests
indicate no abnormalcies.

199
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,249
Could you walk me
through what happened again?

200
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,986
I woke up and I'm different.

201
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,689
Huh, I see.

202
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,893
Do you treat this all the time?

203
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,994
Well, not personally.

204
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,897
I have heard of similar cases,

205
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:43,167
but yours just...
just didn't seem to fit.

206
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,638
Have you been hit
on the head recently?

207
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,107
No.

208
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,544
Well, without a clear cause

209
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,313
I can't make
any specific recommendation.

210
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:59,983
But I think speech therapy

211
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,485
could possibly help
your situation.

212
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:04,488
- Then I'll be back to normal?
- We'll have to wait and see.

213
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,757
Maybe it will all make sense
somehow.

214
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,392
How?

215
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:12,897
In other news, tempers flared

216
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:15,199
at last night city
council meeting.

217
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,100
Ongoing talks have broken down

218
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:20,003
at the mayor's controversial
flighted deadline

219
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,172
for the decision
on the fate of the tree.

220
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,808
Remember to shape your vowels?

221
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,743
Watch your mouth
when you shape them.

222
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,579
How is it? Do I sound normal?

223
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,181
Well, let's try it again.

224
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:37,554
In all other news,
tempers flared...

225
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,025
I don't know. She's never late.

226
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,627
Yeah, but what about
the weather?

227
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:44,828
Hmm?

228
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,931
Oh, yeah. Right.

229
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:48,599
[phone ringing]

230
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,301
This is Bruce.

231
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,103
[man] <i>Hello,
this is Dr. Cunningham.</i>

232
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,438
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

233
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:56,106
<i>that we're finding
Miss Jones's illness</i>

234
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:57,741
<i>to be stubbornly persisting.</i>

235
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,243
[sighs]

236
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,178
You have a time frame
for her recovery?

237
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,914
<i>Not as of yet, no.</i>

238
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:05,148
<i>We're still monitoring
the situation.</i>

239
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,450
We've already had
to bump back

240
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,252
her interview
with the mayor twice.

241
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,520
Can I speak with her?

242
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,622
<i>Well, frankly,
it's nothing too serious.</i>

243
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:14,424
<i>However, I do recommend
continued rest.</i>

244
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,963
Well, I'm sure
you know what's best, doctor.

245
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,230
Thanks for letting me know.

246
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:23,800
Not at all, sir.
You have a great day.

247
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,569
Can I have my $20 now lady?

248
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:28,805
- Don't spend it on drugs.
- Not gonna spend it on drugs.

249
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:30,607
You spend it on drugs.

250
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,016
Is everything
still perfectly normal, sir?

251
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,850
What?

252
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,252
Oh... thank you.

253
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,158
There you are.

254
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:53,297
- Did work hold you up again?
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:54,731
Good.

256
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,167
Because
that's perfectly normal.

257
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:04,174
Mm, the steak is delicious.

258
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:13,650
I said, "Mm,
this steak is delicious."

259
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:14,785
Mm-hmm.

260
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:25,562
[beep] <i>This is Ashley Jones.
Leave a message.</i>

261
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,264
Ashley, you've got
to let me know

262
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,933
about this Mayor thing
tomorrow.

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,467
You're my rock star.

264
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:33,470
Let's try it again.
Now repeat after me.

265
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:35,505
Greedy goats
gobbled up gooseberries

266
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,841
getting good
at grabbing the goodies.

267
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,312
- Ashley?
- I'm trying.

268
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:45,582
Okay, well.

269
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,354
Here's something
you might want to try.

270
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,756
It's a little different.

271
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:55,826
Different?

272
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,132
[German accent]
It vas the fourth of July

273
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,602
seven years ago.

274
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:12,609
Ve vere sitting on ze dock
of ze Marina eating a pizza,

275
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,312
ven suddenly I hear
this frightening cry...

276
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,316
I look and I see
a child sinking.

277
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,887
I'm sinking... I have to help.

278
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:25,422
Vell, I jumped right in ze water

279
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,791
and just as I pushed her
to safety

280
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,162
I was run over by a boat.

281
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:35,465
I drowned.

282
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:38,735
And I woke up speaking
something like zis.

283
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,338
I have seen some dark days
since then.

284
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,173
But I want everybody of you

285
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,409
to know how much I
appreciate you.

286
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,678
Zis is ze best turnout yet

287
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,314
for our foreign accent
syndrome support group.

288
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,317
[applauding]

289
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,356
Hi.

290
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,659
[French accent]
I'm Guy.

291
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,595
I kind of ran the streets
my whole life with a rock group.

292
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:12,103
And it kind of gives me
my identity, you know?

293
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,237
One day zat all went away.

294
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,807
We were about to do our
biggest iced [indistinct]

295
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:19,409
and then sleep in ze
[indistinct] at morning.

296
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:22,579
Woke up in the hospital
with his accent.

297
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:28,251
And my gang,
zey kicked me out.

298
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,655
Zey say I wasn't hard no more.

299
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,727
Oh, <i>ja</i>,
it is perfectly normal for us

300
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,063
to feel
like vee no longer fit in.

301
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,932
Senk you, brother.

302
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:42,666
[door opens]

303
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,501
[British accent]
Hello, hello, hello gents.

304
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:46,369
Sorry for the tardiness

305
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,405
but money never sleeps,
you know.

306
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:51,175
Okay, as you all know,
way before this

307
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:53,744
I was
a lowly construction worker.

308
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,213
I didn't even know

309
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:57,347
what foreign accent
syndrome was.

310
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,749
I mean, who would have thought

311
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,517
that the hit on the head
with a sledgehammer

312
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,786
would have endowed me
with a charismatic accent

313
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:06,490
and a fabulous way of life
as an entrepreneur.

314
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:09,459
Let that be a lesson to you.
Don't wear a helmet.

315
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,129
It's "antapreneure".

316
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:12,729
Okay, all right.

317
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:15,032
Everybody good, are they?
How's the family?

318
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:18,236
- They stopped talking to me.
- Well, you can't win them all.

319
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,972
Well, you can't win them all.
I can.

320
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:25,109
Wait a minute. I think we have
a new face with us today.

321
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,878
What's your name, darling?

322
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,446
Hello. My name is Ashley.

323
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,949
Oh, a Japanese accent.

324
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,850
That's good.

325
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:35,086
[chuckles] Why?

326
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:36,888
Vell, it makes sense.

327
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:39,723
How?

328
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,498
So, tell us about yourself.

329
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:51,668
I want to learn more
about foreign accent syndrome.

330
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,504
You came to the right place.
We're all friends here.

331
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:58,408
Good, because I just woke up
and spoke this way.

332
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:00,744
You know, it's very confusing.

333
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,415
So how did you hurt
your head, <i>ma cherie</i>?

334
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,252
I never hurt my head.

335
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:10,754
It vazen't a stroke?
What? Did you drown?

336
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,056
No.

337
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:14,825
Let me
get this straight, love.

338
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,726
You never hit your head?

339
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:18,728
No.

340
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,801
Becky's beagles barked and...

341
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,537
Is this ever going
to get easier?

342
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:29,573
Of course,
you were doing great.

343
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,842
Really?

344
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,944
Yeah.

345
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,181
And even if nothing
ever comes from the therapy,

346
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,016
you don't have to worry.

347
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,350
No?

348
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:44,621
No. Maybe it all
kind of makes sense.

349
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,260
How? How does it make sense
for me, for anybody else,

350
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,995
to go to sleep one night

351
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,264
and wake up the next morning
with Japanese accent,

352
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,099
or any other accent?

353
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,401
How does it make sense at all?

354
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:02,940
No, I guess it just doesn't make
any sense at all.

355
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:04,841
But it seems like it should.

356

00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,603
[laughing]

537
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,340
[crying] Ashley!

538
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:52,583
[phone ringing]

539
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:55,419
Ashley.

540
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,525
[ringing coming from her mouth]

541
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,582
THANK YOU

542
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,320
Do you need any change?

543
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:34,758
[knocking]

544
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:37,327
Hello.

545
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:45,870
Sorry, I kind of need you
to tell me.

546
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,874
[normal accent] No,
you can keep the change.

547
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:56,680
Keep the change.

548
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,350
Thank you.

549
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:08,592
My name is Ashley Jones.

550
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:15,198
My name is Ashley Jones.

551
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:17,434
[cheering and applauding]

552
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,238
[crying]

553
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:24,541
<i>Joke! Joke! Joke! Joke!</i>

554
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:26,243
Well...

555
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,346
Just one.

556
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:32,884
Knock, knock.

557
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,519
[laughing and applauding]

558
00:31:00,078 --> 00:31:01,411
[knocking on door]

559
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,117
- Who's there?
- Tiffany.

560
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,351
- Tiffany who?
- Oh my God. Funny.

561
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,524
Put your shoes on. Let's go.

562
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:17,327
- Where?
- To the party. Remember?

563
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:20,497
- Big tree fundraiser?
- Oh, I'm busy tonight.

564
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,666
You expect me to believe that?

565
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:27,504
I can go. I'm sick.

566
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:30,975
What kind of sick?

567
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:33,810
Uh, I throw up.

568
00:31:33,878 --> 00:31:35,612
You're going to throw up?

569
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,648
- Yes.
- Okay.

570
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:42,419
I'll wait.

571
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,995
- I'm much better now.
- Oh, good.

572
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:53,898
Want some gum?

573
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:56,433
Sure.

574
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,872
How about this dress?
Do you like it?

575
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:06,010
Everybody's gonna be there.
You want to look good, right?

576
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:09,113
I don't care.

577
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,515
Ooh, I look good in this one.

578
00:32:13,117 --> 00:32:14,684
Yeah, Dwayne will love it.

579
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,321
This sucks.

580
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,323
If something bad
had to happen to me,

581
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,226
why couldn't it be
some good bad thing

582
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:23,560
that's obvious

583
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:25,629
so everybody
feels sorry for me.

584
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,900
But this,
this just confuses people.

585
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,767
Because seems
like it should make sense,

586
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,069
but it doesn't.

587
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:40,244
Look. I understand
why you're upset, okay?

588
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,779
Because your life
isn't perfectly normal anymore.

589
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:45,515
I don't like it either.

590
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:47,818
I don't like it at all.

591
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,857
But we're gonna fix you.

592
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:54,724
And we'll start
by getting you a new Larry.

593
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:59,063
And then your life
will be perfectly normal again.

594
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,730
And we'll all be comfortable.

595
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,767
Well, it doesn't go
back to normal.

596
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:09,006
<i>Tiffany was shocked to realize</i>

597
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:11,741
<i>that she had never considered
this possibility.</i>

598
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:13,643
<i>She was equally shocked
to realize</i>

599
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,247
<i>that Ashley might no longer be
the friend she used to know.</i>

600
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:19,150
<i>And Ashley was shocked
to realize</i>

601
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,618
<i>what Tiffany had just realized.</i>

602
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:25,056
Let's go to the party.

603
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:27,557
[chuckles] Okay, awesome.

604
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:30,261
Oh, and you have to get
ten phone numbers

605
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:31,494
by the end of the night.

606
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:34,098
- Ten? How about three?
- Five.

607
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,599
Five. I don't know.

608
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,734
I'm not confident enough
to get five numbers.

609
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:40,604
Then, just pretend you are.
That's what life's all about.

610
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,007
- Pretending?
- Yes.

611
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:45,042
Pretending to be what?

612
00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:50,614
Whatever anybody
wants you to be.

613
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:56,419
So you get five numbers
and I'll go find Dwayne.

614
00:33:57,654 --> 00:33:59,589
Don't worry. I'll be
by your side the whole time.

615
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:01,259
- [girl] Oh, Dwayne.
- [girl #2] Hey, Dwayne.

616
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:03,793
- Oh, I gotta go.
- I'll come with you.

617
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:06,529
No, stay here.
Get some numbers.

618
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:08,465
[cater] There you go.
On the rocks for you.

619
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:09,833
Oh, thank you sir.

620
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:12,003
Martini no olives
coming right up.

621
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:22,914
Hey, give me your number.

622
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,183
Right on.

623
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:34,091
[chuckles]

624
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,062
So, what made you come over here
and talk to me?

625
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:39,763
<i>And just like that,</i>

626
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,766
<i>Ashley realized
she owned this place.</i>

627
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:46,536
<i>The party, not the house.</i>

628
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:48,772
<i>She owned a different house.</i>

629
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,807
- Hey, gave me your number.
- What?

630
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:53,677
- My phone number?
- Yeah, your number right now.

631
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,645
What do you...
What are you talking about?

632
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,284
Who's Dave?

633
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:01,451
[toilet flushing]

634
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,752
Oh, give me the number.

635
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:05,389
Oh, whoa, whoa.
She is with me, bro.

636
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:07,191
Wait... What?

637
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:09,826
Give me your number.
I want your number, please.

638
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:12,029
Okay.

639
00:35:12,096 --> 00:35:13,830
Wait, why are you asking him
for his number?

640
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,467
I have lots of phone calls
to make.

641
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,103
Well, give me back my number.

642
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:22,373
Look, I'll be perfectly honest
with you.

643
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,375
I'm trying to get five numbers.

644
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:27,211
You're trying to get
five numbers?

645
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:28,812
Yeah, I have to.

646
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,847
Well, then
I'm not giving you mine.

647
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:32,883
What? You're not giving her
your number?

648
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,085
No.

649
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:36,786
All right, you can take
my number back.

650
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:39,890
Okay, it was nice meeting you.
Both.

651
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,562
I love your accent.
I drive a Honda.

652
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:47,298
You go get us some food, okay?

653
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:50,201
Okay... meatballs.

654
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:52,236
- Surprise me.
- Right on.

655
00:36:08,185 --> 00:36:09,652
Hey, give me your number.

656
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:12,256
Ashley.

657
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,925
- Larry.
- Hey.

658
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:16,526
Hi.

659
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,363
Tenderloin?

660
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,630
Yeah.

661
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:22,599
But it's too rare, though.

662
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:25,169
Oh, too bad.

663
00:36:25,236 --> 00:36:26,636
Yeah.

664
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:28,939
I know.

665
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:32,776
So, is there anything new?

666
00:36:33,743 --> 00:36:36,213
- Nothing.
- Oh.

667
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,015
You?

668
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:40,683
- I just wanted to say that...
- Hey.

669
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,087
You know, I saw they have
another round of steak out.

670
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:45,822
I'll be right back.

671
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,558
[whispering] Here you go.

672
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,927
Where did you say that...

673
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:53,364
I don't want your number.

674
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:54,999
What is your problem, lady?

675
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,303
I don't even know this guy.
But anyway, did you...

676
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,871
It's a very normal party.

677
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:03,640
- Perfectly normal.
- You think so?

678
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:05,675
Yeah, I love it.

679
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:09,880
Yeah, yeah, me too.

680
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,581
I'm Larry.

681
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,850
- Hi, I'm Emily.
- Emily!

682
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:16,220
That's
a perfectly normal name.

683
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,856
Thanks. It's the most common
woman's name in America.

684
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,358
- Really?
- Wait, Larry...

685
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:23,726
Were you saying to me?

686
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:26,629
Uh, I don't... I...

687
00:37:26,696 --> 00:37:28,765
Can I get you anything?

688
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:31,435
Thanks, but I already got
a plate for myself.

689
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:32,937
Oh, my.

690
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,704
So, they didn't have
any meatballs.

691
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:37,141
[dramatic music playing]

692
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,609
This is my fiancé.

693
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,245
Right on.

694
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,119
- Fiancé?
- Yeah, you wait in here.

695
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,454
I have another big surprise
for you, okay?

696
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:53,290
Wait, this is a coat closet.
Wait... okay.

697
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,492
[sighs]

698
00:37:54,558 --> 00:37:56,460
Hey, give me your number.

699
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,095
Are you serious?

700
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:01,966
Serious. You're very hot.

701
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,701
Well, I can't argue with that.

702
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,605
So, you're Japanese?

703
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,607
You're here
with all the Kobayashi people?

704
00:38:09,672 --> 00:38:12,076
No, I'm not Japanese.
I'm from Allentown.

705
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:22,953
I have a fiancé.

706
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,889
What the crap?
[scoffs]

707
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:36,766
[Dwayne] Hey, Jen,
you're looking good.

708
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:42,406
Hey... I haven't met you yet.

709
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:44,175
Yeah, yeah.

710
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,111
How do you like the party?

711
00:38:47,178 --> 00:38:48,579
This party sucks.

712
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:50,214
What?

713
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:54,652
Where are you from?

714
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:56,686

00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:56,693
Greg, what happened?
Talk to me.

894
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,063
You suck.

895
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,398
[trumpet theme playing]

896
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:05,069
<i>The spaghetti had hit the fan.</i>

897
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:08,940
<i>I had no idea where the team
or the golden leopard got to.</i>

898
00:48:09,006 --> 00:48:10,407
<i>And Greg was dead.</i>

899
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:12,110
<i>I was singing in the wind.</i>

[siren blaring]

901
00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:19,282
<i>He wasn't dead,
but he was dead drunk</i>

902
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:21,052

<i>I have to get ahold of myself.</i>

906
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:29,292
<i>I had to think.</i>

907
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,995
<i>Who pumped off Greg?</i>

908
00:48:31,062 --> 00:48:32,562
<i>Where was the golden leopard?</i>

909
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:35,099
<i>Was doc Cunningham
just playing possum?</i>

910
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:38,401
<i>But most of all,
who was tailing me?</i>

911
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:40,570
Hey, what's up?

912
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:41,438
[whooshing]

913
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:42,974
You need
to start talking, playboy.

914
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,341
What? Do you think I'm pretty?

915
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:45,542
[whooshing]

916
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:47,477
<i>Turns out he knew
as little as I did.</i>

917
00:48:47,544 --> 00:48:48,946
Should I call you?
[grunts]

<i>In the middle
of this swampy mixed up mess,</i>

919
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:55,153
<i>one thing was perfectly clear.</i>

920
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:58,588
<i>I was never gonna find
this dame.</i>

921
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:00,557
- There she is.
- Leave me alone.

922
00:49:00,624 --> 00:49:01,926
- But aren't you the...
- No.

923
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:04,427
Yes, we did an interview.
Do you want to do another one?

924
00:49:04,494 --> 00:49:06,663
- You lied to me?
- What? How?

925
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:09,901
You acted
like you believed me.

926
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:12,569
But it was all
just for ratings, wasn't it?

927
00:49:12,636 --> 00:49:15,772
- Uh...
- Oh, what? You can't talk now?

928
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:20,044
Sorry for what I did.

929
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:24,015
Wait. What happened
to your voice?

930
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:26,017
I don't know.

931
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,052
I'm sorry, I'm not trying

932
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:29,686
to make fun of you
or anything.

933
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:32,355
And if it's none of my business.
I apologize.

934
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:36,994
Is it like foreign accent
syndrome or something?

935
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:42,133
<i>Ashley was shocked to realize
that this was the first person</i>

936
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,969
<i>to understand her
in a long time.</i>

937
00:49:46,204 --> 00:49:47,571
Sure, yeah.

938
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:49,806
- Sort of.
- Wow. Really?

939
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:52,375
But you didn't get hit
in the head, right?

940
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:54,278
I mean, if you had
serious head trauma

941
00:49:54,344 --> 00:49:56,214
you wouldn't be up
and around already.

942
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,316
No, I wasn't.

943
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:00,284
Just woke up this way.

944
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,585
Just happened.

945
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:04,487
Jesus, that is frustrating.

946
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,359
Yeah, it's very lonely.

947
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,928
Well, you're allowed
to feel that.

948
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:14,098
But wait, you've got
a Japanese accent.

949
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:17,534
That is complicated.

950
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:21,072
I'll bet people have no idea
what to think of you, do they?

951
00:50:22,974 --> 00:50:25,675
I'll bet there's even people
who don't believe you.

952
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:26,810
Right?

953
00:50:26,878 --> 00:50:29,146
Well, it's not
a very credible story.

954
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:32,616
But doesn't mean
it's not true.

955
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:36,220
Yeah, but it doesn't make
any sense.

956
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,856
Which sucks, because it seems
like it should make sense,

957
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,690
but it doesn't.

958
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:44,128
Well, maybe you're wrong
to assume

959
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:47,631
that you are the version of you
that can understand this.

960
00:50:47,697 --> 00:50:49,867
Maybe the version of you
that can understand

961
00:50:49,934 --> 00:50:53,503
what you're going through
right now

962
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,240
is the one you become
after you go through it all.

963
00:50:56,307 --> 00:50:57,440
[birds chirping]

964
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,176
That would be terrible.

965
00:50:59,243 --> 00:51:01,544
No, that would be the life.

966
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:07,251
Come on.

967
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:08,652
Do this interview.

968
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:10,988
[sighs]

969
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:14,591
You seem nice.
And I would like to help you.

970
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:20,264
But I'm 27.

971
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:21,899
Twenty seven?

972
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:25,269
Thirty one.

973
00:51:25,336 --> 00:51:26,871
Thirty two, okay.

974
00:51:26,938 --> 00:51:30,975
So... sorry, you know,
I can't do it.

975
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:36,314
The chase was over.
It was a dead end.

976
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,316
It was curtains for me.

977
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:40,117
Case closed.

978
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,425
Um... are you okay?

979
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,060
I don't know.

980
00:51:51,996 --> 00:51:55,066
Do you want to get
some dinner and talk about it?

981
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:04,774
[dishes clanking]

982
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:13,150
Well, this is nice.

983
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:17,021
Yeah.

984
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:19,656
What do you recommend?

985
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:22,826
I always get the spaghetti.

986
00:52:24,028 --> 00:52:26,864
Okay. Marinara?

987
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:28,332
Yeah.

988
00:52:28,399 --> 00:52:30,167
- Meatballs?
- Uh, no.

989
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:31,634
Oh, why not?

990
00:52:34,305 --> 00:52:37,574
I don't know. It's not normal.

991
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,311
And normalcy is good.

992
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:42,947
Oh, I think
you mean normality.

993
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:45,282
Huh?

994
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:48,618
Um, I'm not
to be pedantic here,

995
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:50,321
but this drives me nuts.

996
00:52:50,388 --> 00:52:51,956
Adjectives that end in a "T"

997
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:55,960
get a "CY" suffix
when becoming a noun. Right?

998
00:52:56,027 --> 00:53:01,032
Pregnant - cy, frequent - cy,
transparent - cy.

999
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:06,303
Adjectives that end in "AL"
get an "ITY" suffix.

1000
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,173
Mental - mentality,
real - reality,

1001
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,275
formal - formality. Normal...

1002
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:12,742
Normalcy!

1003
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:20,284
Uh, good evening.
Can I get your usual?

1004
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:21,952
Can we see a menu, please?

1005
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:23,254
[chuckles]

1006
00:53:25,056 --> 00:53:26,290
Why?

1007
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:28,192
I guess we need a minute.

1008
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:32,196
Yeah.

1009
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,231
Okay.

1010
00:53:34,865 --> 00:53:35,799
Weird.

1011
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:37,501
So, what else is good here?

1012
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,636
Tenderloin and potatoes
are her favorite.

1013
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,674
But, whatever.
I'll get the menus.

1014
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,947
I mean, what else
have you tried?

1015
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:52,950
Just the spaghetti.

1016
00:53:54,518 --> 00:53:57,555
How many times
have you been here?

1017
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,723
Well, once in a week
for the last six years

1018
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:06,330
puts us around... 300.

1019
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:09,467
So you've been here 300 times

1020
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:11,235
and you've never tried
anything

1021
00:54:11,302 --> 00:54:12,970
other than the spaghetti?

1022
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:16,840
Yeah.

1023
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:20,010
Well, what's wrong?

1024
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:23,180
You know...

1025
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:25,983
All of this.

1026
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:29,353
Yeah.

1027
00:54:30,321 --> 00:54:31,721
I know.

1028
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:35,292
I've been down
in the dumps too before.

1029
00:54:36,293 --> 00:54:37,660
You have?

1030
00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:41,966
Yeah, like when I was
in the shipping business,

1031
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:46,070
I accidentally imported
the Black Death into Europe.

1032
00:54:46,137 --> 00:54:47,670
[sighs]

1033
00:54:47,737 --> 00:54:49,573
I felt like they really
didn't take that well,

1034
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:50,975
but you know.

1035
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,143
I'm sorry.

1036
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,912
Yeah, not as sorry
as the Florentines.

1037
00:54:56,914 --> 00:55:00,783
Okay, wait.
You're not really 32.

1038
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,187
You are 500,000 years old!

1039
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:04,721
[shushing]

1040
00:55:05,289 --> 00:55:07,391
Okay, sorry.

1041
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:09,960
I just said that because I...

1042
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:11,661
Wait...

1043
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,830
So you do believe me?

1044
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:18,903
Well, if you say so.
Yeah, it's good enough for me.

1045
00:55:21,038 --> 00:55:22,373
Really?

1046
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:25,609
<i>Evie was shocked to realize
that this was the first person</i>

1047
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:27,777
<i>to understand her
in a long time.</i>

1048
00:55:27,844 --> 00:55:30,014
<i>A very long time.</i>

1049
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,284
<i>A very, very,
very, very, very, very...</i>

1050
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,751
[clears throat]

1051
00:55:39,822 --> 00:55:42,092
Are you ready yet?

1052
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:46,330
Could you bring us
a basket of bread?

1053
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:47,697
Bread?

1054
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:51,035
You do have bread, right?

1055
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:52,970
For her.

1056
00:55:54,704 --> 00:55:56,040
Yeah.

1057
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,075
All right.

1058
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:03,514
Okay, look,
you should do the interview.

1059
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:06,550
[sighs] Let's not spoil dinner.

1060
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:09,719
But if you're really
500,000 years old

1061
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,889
you should be true to yourself.

1062
00:56:11,956 --> 00:56:14,625
Joan of Arc was true to herself.

1063
00:56:14,692 --> 00:56:16,460
And look where it got her.

1064
00:56:16,527 --> 00:56:18,195
Steak, well done.

1065
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:20,397
But don't you think
you owe it to humanity?

1066
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,934
Because people want to know
that they can live forever too.

1067
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:28,505
Living forever
is the worst kind of hell.

1068
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:33,978
- You should just do it.
- Why?

1069
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:36,846
Because...

1070
00:56:38,182 --> 00:56:40,217
Because you could get famous.

1071
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:41,885
[laughing]

1072
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,189
Okay, nice try.

1073
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:50,327
Your... bread.

1074
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,732
- I will have the spaghetti.
- Oh, thank God.

1075
00:56:54,797 --> 00:56:55,832
With marinara.

1076
00:56:55,899 --> 00:56:57,668
- Yes, please.
- Excellent choice.

1077
00:56:57,735 --> 00:57:00,504
So, two spaghettis
with marinara.

1078
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:05,175
Right?

1079
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:11,915
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

1080
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:14,151
Because you can't be
too careful with the plague.

1081
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:19,789
Well?

1082
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,227
Don't do...

1083
00:57:24,928 --> 00:57:26,796
Don't do it.

1084
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,465
[sighs]

1085
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:31,902
[sighs]

1086
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:34,672
[whispering] What's the opposite
of spaghetti with marinara?

1087
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:36,674
Tenderloin and potatoes.

1088
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,475
No.

1089
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:51,155
Could you please just order
the spaghetti with marinara?

1090
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:53,324
No.

1091
00:57:57,995 --> 00:57:59,363
What's wrong?

1092
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:02,832
All the other things.

1093
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:05,569
Where's Larry?

1094
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,238
[scoffs]

1095
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:15,813
Did I do something wrong?

1096
00:58:15,879 --> 00:58:18,515
What? No. Of course not.

1097
00:58:19,516 --> 00:58:21,385
I guess it's me.

1098
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,558
I don't think you should come
in here anymore.

1099
00:58:27,624 --> 00:58:30,294
Yeah, me neither.

1100
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:34,465
You've changed.

1101
00:58:34,531 --> 00:58:37,301
Believe me, I'm sorry for that.

1102
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,171
So am I.

1103
00:58:42,473 --> 00:58:44,274
So am I.

1104
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,653
I'll have the fish.

1105
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:07,364
[rumbling]

1106
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:14,204
[beeping]

1107
00:59:14,271 --> 00:59:16,740
That was a lovely meal. Right?

1108
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:18,208
Yeah.

1109
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:21,812
Did that fish not agree
with you?

1110
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,915
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

1111
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,017
I don't even know who I am.

1112
00:59:27,084 --> 00:59:29,319
What... what do you mean?

1113
00:59:29,386 --> 00:59:34,458
I mean, am I a news anchor
or fiancée or detective.

1114
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:36,760
Have you ever felt
like an old woman?

1115
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,463
[laughing]

1116
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,964
Me?

1117
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:45,235
Come look at this.

1118
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,572
Tell me what you see.

1119
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,375
A tree.

1120
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:52,943
A tree?

1121
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:55,546
Do you see
anything more than that?

1122
00:59:55,612 --> 00:59:57,247
I don't know.

1123
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,618
A tree.

1124
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:05,189
Ever growing, ever changing.

1125
01:00:05,255 --> 01:00:08,225
Familiar, yet unique.

1126
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,528
Okay.

1127
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:12,996
Let me ask you something.

1128
01:00:13,063 --> 01:00:15,666
Would this miracle of nature
stop being a tree

1129
01:00:15,732 --> 01:00:17,869
if it lost its leaves?

1130
01:00:17,936 --> 01:00:19,169
No.

1131
01:00:19,236 --> 01:00:20,771
Would it stop being a tree

1132
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:22,606
if its leaves were
a different color?

1133
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:24,943
I guess not.

1134
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,510
No, of course it wouldn't.

1135
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:29,046
Because a tree isn't defined
by the little things.

1136
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:31,515
It's all about
what's at the core. You know?

1137
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:37,421
You are still Ashley Jones.

1138
01:00:37,488 --> 01:00:40,057
And Ashley Jones
is a wonderful person,

1139
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:42,693
no matter what color
her leaves are.

1140
01:00:46,196 --> 01:00:48,699
Thank you. Thank you, Evie.

1141
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:52,569
All right, poor kid.

1142
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:02,079
I remember when I was your age

1143
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:04,448
I thought
I was all grown up too.

1144
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:13,423
Hey, maybe I should do
this interview.

1145
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,160
Really?

1146
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:19,263
Yeah.

1147
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:22,165
Maybe we'll find out the truth.

1148
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:25,135
Maybe I'll get famous.

1149
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:28,272
<i>So in the end, Ashley's trap
had worked perfectly.</i>

1150
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:31,009
<i>She had Evie
right where she wanted her.</i>

1151
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:32,809
[chainsaw rumbling]

1152
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:38,917
[keyboard clacking]

1153
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:40,384
[knocking on door]

1154
01:01:41,051 --> 01:01:42,619
There she is.

1155
01:01:43,855 --> 01:01:45,422
There's my rock star.

1156
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:48,191
- It's great to be back.
- Seriously.

1157
01:01:48,258 --> 01:01:50,160
It's like our family
is reunited.

1158
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:54,331
You, me, makeup girl, Jim.

1159
01:01:54,398 --> 01:01:58,502
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, Bruce.

1160
01:01:58,569 --> 01:01:59,636
John's landed.

1161
01:01:59,703 --> 01:02:02,907
The 5000 year old woman.

1162
01:02:02,974 --> 01:02:04,274
Five hundred thousand.

1163
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,743
Okay, this is gonna be great.

1164
01:02:08,612 --> 01:02:11,381
There she is.
There's my rock star.

1165
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:15,019
- This is gonna be great.
- That's great.

1166
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:16,653
- This is going to be great.
- That's great.

1167
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,322
So great.

1168
01:02:18,388 --> 01:02:20,190
<i>Just then Ashley realized</i>

1169
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:22,894
<i>she was having
a crisis of conscience.</i>

1170
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:24,528
What? No, I'm not.

1171
01:02:24,595 --> 01:02:25,629
<i>She felt guilty</i>

1172
01:02:25,696 --> 01:02:27,097
<i>that she was doing
whatever it took</i>

1173
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:28,432
<i>to get her old job back.</i>

1174
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:30,500
It's not just a job.
It's my life.

1175
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:33,103
<i>It wasn't just your life.
It was her integrity.</i>

1176
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,605
Oh, that's your opinion.

1177
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,340
<i>Okay, so then you know</i>

1178
01:02:36,406 --> 01:02:38,308
<i>that you're doing
the right thing?</i>

1179
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:40,811
Look, I don't see
what the big problem is.

1180
01:02:40,878 --> 01:02:42,179
Well, the big problem

1181
01:02:42,245 --> 01:02:44,048
is that she hasn't gone
through hair and makeup

1182
01:02:44,114 --> 01:02:46,116
or wardrobe
and she's on in 30.

1183
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:48,987
- You're a producer now.
- Yeah.

1184
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:51,221
That's great. That's great.

1185
01:02:51,288 --> 01:02:53,290
<i>No, that's not great.</i>

1186
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:54,324
Why?

1187
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:55,927
<i>You're taking advantage
of Evie, you know?</i>

1188
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:57,127
No, I'm not.

1189
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:58,896
Then what are you doing?

1190
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,598
Aren't we just giving a voice

1191
01:03:01,665 --> 01:03:03,667
to someone who otherwise
wouldn't be heard?

1192
01:03:03,734 --> 01:03:04,768
That's right.

1193
01:03:04,835 --> 01:03:05,970
<i>Is it?</i>

1194
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:08,205
I don't know.
This is between you two?

1195
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:11,009
Yeah. Besides,
this was all Bruce's idea.

1196
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:12,442
The wheel is already in motion.

1197
01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:15,212
<i>Are you honestly saying
it's impossible to stop this</i>

1198
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:16,146
<i>if that were...</i>

1199
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:17,915
Okay, okay, I'll talk to Bruce.

1200
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,191
What happens
if you don't do this interview?

1201
01:03:28,258 --> 01:03:29,726
- <i>What happens is...</i>
- [shushing]

1202
01:03:29,793 --> 01:03:31,194
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

1203
01:03:35,198 --> 01:03:38,168
What happens is...

1204
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:41,471
<i>The choice
for Ashley was perfectly clear.</i>

1205
01:03:41,538 --> 01:03:43,440
Look, it's not
just black and white.

1206
01:03:43,507 --> 01:03:46,710
- Black or white?
- I've not decided yet.

1207
01:03:46,777 --> 01:03:49,413
<i>The choice was clear.
It was time to talk to...</i>

1208
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:50,447
Tiffany.

1209
01:03:50,514 --> 01:03:52,050
You have some nerves
coming back here.

1210
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:54,351
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, I bet.

1211
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:56,020
No, really. I need you
to believe me

1212
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:57,955
- that I wasn't trying to...
- Look, if it's not about work,

1213
01:03:58,022 --> 01:03:59,523
I don't want to hear it.

1214
01:04:00,058 --> 01:04:01,291
Okay.

1215
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:03,527
I just wanted to talk to you
about this interview.

1216
01:04:03,593 --> 01:04:05,462
No, you changed.

1217
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:07,330
<i>She might have had
something there.</i>

1218
01:04:07,397 --> 01:04:09,499
Yeah. Larry dumped you.

1219
01:04:09,566 --> 01:04:11,768
And then you got jealous
of me and Dwayne.

1220
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,203
<i>Nah, she lost it.</i>

1221
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,972
Lunch order for Tiffany.

1222
01:04:16,406 --> 01:04:19,543
But I will say this.
He's not just some beefcake.

1223
01:04:19,609 --> 01:04:23,613
He's smart and sensitive,
and deep and smart.

1224
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,183
<i>Niihau</i>, amigos.

1225
01:04:25,248 --> 01:04:27,051
<i>Tiffany looked
for something crushing</i>

1226
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:29,519
<i>to say to her amigo Ashley.</i>

1227
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:30,654
You suck.

1228
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:35,559
<i>Though it wasn't as crushing
as she had hoped.</i>

1229
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,394
Okay, okay, how about this?

1230
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:39,197
<i>Why don't you
just go talk to her?</i>

1231
01:04:39,262 --> 01:04:40,697
Who? Tiffany?

1232
01:04:40,764 --> 01:04:42,365
<i>[sighing]</i>

1233
01:04:42,432 --> 01:04:44,902
I can't. I'm really busy.

1234
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:47,637
<i>Well, it kinda seems
like you're just using her.</i>

1235
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:48,805
No, I'm not.

1236
01:04:55,612 --> 01:04:57,781
See? She wants to do this.

1237
01:04:57,848 --> 01:04:59,483
<i>Uh-humm.</i>

1238
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:01,418
Look, I'm the victim here.

1239
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:03,420
I only lost my job
in the first place

1240
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,089
because something
happened to me

1241
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:06,124
that I couldn't control.

1242
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,290
<i>But you can control this.</i>

1243
01:05:07,357 --> 01:05:10,260
Yeah, he's right.
It's indefensible.

1244
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:11,896
Yeah, he's right.

1245
01:05:13,197 --> 01:05:14,331
Don't listen to them.

1246
01:05:14,397 --> 01:05:16,234
You're getting everything
you want out of this.

1247
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:17,902
You're getting
your old life back,

1248
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:19,336
you're getting your job back.

1249
01:05:19,402 --> 01:05:21,205
<i>Um, not exactly.</i>

1250
01:05:21,271 --> 01:05:23,774
Close enough.
It's a return to normalcy.

1251
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,543
Plus, I'm telling you,
this will impress Larry.

1252
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,644
Right?

1253
01:05:27,711 --> 01:05:30,680
- Actually, yes, because I...
- Okay.

1254
01:05:30,747 --> 01:05:31,548
See?

1255
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:33,717
But, what about my integrity?

1256
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:36,319
It's not your integrity.
It's your life.

1257
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:38,588
Yeah.

1258
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:42,726
<i>So then your solution
to all this is...</i>

1259
01:05:42,793 --> 01:05:43,693
You know what?

1260
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,129
I'm not listening to you
anymore.

1261
01:05:45,196 --> 01:05:46,463
Call for Ashley.

1262
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:48,166
<i>You're just trying to ignore
the problem. Over.</i>

1263
01:05:48,232 --> 01:05:49,332
Copy that.

1264
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:50,767
No, I'm not?

1265
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:52,335
Yeah, you are.

1266
01:05:52,402 --> 01:05:53,905
You're making
the mistake of thinking

1267
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:56,540
that not fixing the problem
is a solution.

1268
01:05:56,606 --> 01:05:58,142
But conflict avoidance

1269
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:00,077
is not synonymous
with conflict resolution.

1270
01:06:00,144 --> 01:06:01,879
- Who are you?
- I'm Pat.

1271
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:03,247
You're fired.

1272
01:06:03,313 --> 01:06:05,216
Oh... great.

1273
01:06:05,283 --> 01:06:07,151
<i>Don't you think
they might laugh at her?</i>

1274
01:06:07,218 --> 01:06:08,685
Nobody's gonna laugh at her.

01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:16,526
She's old enough
to make that call.

1280
01:06:16,593 --> 01:06:18,762
<i>Yeah. And how old
is she again?</i>

1281
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:20,730
I'm not the one
you should be talking to.

1285
01:06:26,037 --> 01:06:28,940
Yeah, the wound on your back
got infected, so...

1286
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:30,707
Oh no, wait...

1287
01:06:30,774 --> 01:06:33,677

Thanks for coming.

Who cares?

1294
01:06:44,788 --> 01:06:47,724
Wait, somebody else
has only ten minutes to live?

1295
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:50,862
Excuse me.

1296
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:56,167
You got your job back.

1297
01:06:56,234 --> 01:06:58,835

- Oh.
- It's all in your hands now.

You just have to do
exactly what I say.

<i>And with that, Ashley knew

I'll do it.

<i>One question, okay?</i>

01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,320

Oh, sorry. Sheesh!

1307
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:25,863
<i>Why is she doing

Oh, are you doing

Yes.

Are you nervous?

01:08:10,308 --> 01:08:12,009
I'm okay.

1327
01:08:12,076 --> 01:08:15,079
Do you have any questions
before we start?

1328
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,349
I guess not.

1329
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:21,484
No, really.
We can talk about it.

1330
01:08:21,551 --> 01:08:23,888
Do you have any concerns?

1331
01:08:23,955 --> 01:08:25,488
[scoffs] Nah.

1332
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:32,363
I mean, how would you feel
like if they laugh,

1333
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:33,763
if they don't believe you?

1334
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,499
[scoffs] Of course
they're gonna laugh.

1335
01:08:36,566 --> 01:08:38,501
Of course
they're not gonna believe me.

1337
01:08:40,004 --> 01:08:42,672
Then, why are you doing
this interview?

Well, I just thought
it would help you out.

This lady is a good, kind,
thoughtful friend.

Probably kinder than any of us.

500,000 years old.

1358
01:09:58,049 --> 01:10:01,218
And to be honest...
maybe I don't.

1359
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:08,325
I know how easy it is
to ignore reality
