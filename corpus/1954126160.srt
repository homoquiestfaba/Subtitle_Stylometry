1
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:22,447
1536 - MEXICO
PACIFIC COAST

2
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,247
Eight years!

3
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,746
Hey, little ...
How old are you?

4
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,081
19 years, sir,

5
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,880
two spent in this country.

6
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,550
Countries ...

7
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:29,681
In these countries ...

8
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,981
In this land ...

9
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,293
And your master?

10
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,129
Leave, leave ...

11
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:03,131
How?

12
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,551
He became what,
your captain?

13
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:09,012
Ah, Narváez ...

14
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:10,389
Death!

15
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,268
And with him, more than 600 men.

16
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:16,812
It has been hard ...

17
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,899
Living so many years
among the wild ...

18
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:56,643
Eight years ago in Florida

19
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,321
What assembly, gentlemen!
What meeting?

20
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,450
What grace and sweetness ...

21
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,581
And our clothes, sumptuous

22
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,584
are enhanced with the gold of India!

23
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:26,924
Blessings Cross
and the holy Veracruz

24
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:31,470
and the Lord of truth
and the Holy Trinity!

25
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:36,225
Blessed is the soul
which the Lord provides!

26
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,979
Blessed be the day
that the Lord sends us!

27
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,653
Ships?

28
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:50,531
All lost!

29
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,160
Is that all Spain
that remains?

30
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,163
These boats are Spain ...

31
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,040
Where ...

32
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,543
Where ...

33
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:05,337
are the other boats?

34
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:08,590
Ahoy, mateys!

35
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,764
There!

36
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,058
There!

37
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,978
I see a shadow!

38
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,064
It Narváez!

39
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:25,941
- Here!
- Captain!

40
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,902
Ahoy, mateys!

41
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,238
- Here!
- By Here!

42
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:33,115
Here Captain!

43
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,203
Over here, Captain!

44
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,417
Another annoyance, Alvar Núñez?

45
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:48,130
Captain, at this speed,
can not follow you.

46
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,757
So what do you suggest then?

47
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:53,760
To tie a rope to our raft.

48
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,554
Considering ...

49
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,764
that your men are younger
and more robust.

50
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,600
Listen, Treasurer

51
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,478
This is no time
give orders.

52
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,857
From now
that everyone here ...

53
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,277
This seemed preferable
to save his life!

54
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,154
You're the captain!

55
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,739
And those lives ...

56
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:16,241
you were assigned!

57
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,578
Think men in the boat!

58
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,831
They are sick and exhausted.

59
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,708
Give me the oars!

60
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,127
Grab it!

61
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:42,142
You are warned, Don Alvaro.

62
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:45,771
It's every man for himself,
there is more authority.

63
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,315
Here ends Spain.

64
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:50,609
Ramez, you!

65
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,361
Captain Narváez,

66
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,988
the smallness of your soul
equaled

67
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:58,283
the enormity of your selfishness.

68
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:02,496
Heals your language
fucking priest!

69
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,706
I tend,

70
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,585
but my last words
will be for you.

71
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,047
Here ends Spain
you say?

72
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,176
Well,
ends here for you too

73
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:19,346
hope of eternal life!

74
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:24,768
Good navigation, laddie!

75
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:39,408
Stop!

76
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:40,951
What assembly, gentlemen!
What meeting?

77
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,497
Stop, you get drunk
for days!

78
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:50,169
Stop! And then die!
Go to hell!

79
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,381
Leave him alone!

80
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,180
Ground!

81
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:03,515
Earth ...

82
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,894
A place to die.

83
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,156
Loosely based

84
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,241
THE STORY "SINKING"

85
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:26,038
Cabeza de Vaca (1542)

86
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,132
Nothing.

87
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,100
I did not find water.

88
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,643
Estebanico will seek.

89
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:43,313
In this direction.
Hurry.

90
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,170
Álvar!

91
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,691
I understand these cases,

92
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,152
they come
Boat Captain.

93
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,906
They are full
of junk and merchandise.

94
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,659
Some stuff
we would be very useful.

95
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,870
What the hell are they doing here?

96
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:06,957
Go ahead, Esteban.

97
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,144
What happened?

98
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,414
He died.

99
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,085
It is witchcraft.

100
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,547
- It must burn.
- How?

101
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,008
Move closer to the boxes.

102
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,219
Put it on fire.

103
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,477
Brother Suárez ...

104
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:11,647
- These objects of witchcraft ...
- It was a good Christian.

105
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,233
Drag them.
All!

106
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,068
It must be buried.

107
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:18,654
Timber!

108
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:21,031
You can not burn.

109
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,325
Collect all the wood
as you can.

110
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,082
- Come ...
- I said no!

111
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,251
Stop, Alvar.

112
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,838
His body is still warm.
You're crazy!

113
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,673
Why not burn my blood?

114
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,133
It's the same blood!

115
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:44,221
I act in the name of God!
I know what I do!

116
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:49,101
In the name of God? You answer
your actions to Him.

117
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,076
This is bad.

118
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:34,428
What they want me,
these dogs?

119
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:38,891
Do not take it!

120
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,437
Let me go!

121
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:45,772
Let me go!

122
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:52,946
Remember ...
Go to Panuco.

123
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:55,699
Still to Panuco!

124
00:22:57,201 --> 00:23:00,162
Do not take it!

125
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:05,083
Remember ... Panuco.

126
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,629
Yes, towards the sunset!

127
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,805
My God!
What am I doing here?

128
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:45,312
In these lands,
in this world!

129
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,570
My God!

130
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:55,239
What am I doing here?

131
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:58,116
I am the slave
a son of a bitch Indian.

132
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:59,451
From a sorcerer!

133
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:02,538
A monstrous creature ...

134
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:04,706
Cursed be the day
I met you.

135
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,836
A sad event
bad thing.

136
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:11,255
That's right, laugh!

137
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,926
In my country,
You would have been impaled.

138
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:24,434
Laugh ... Laugh ... Laugh!

139
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,939
I speak, I speak ...

140
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,650
Because I am
more human than you.

141
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,196
Because I have a world
although I am a wreck.

142
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:39,366
I have a world!
And a God!

143
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,661
Because I also believe ...

144
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,582
the Creator of Heaven
and Earth.

145
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,544
Because you also
He created you, God!

146
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:55,549
I am Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca,

147
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,802
Treasurer Charles I of Spain,

148
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:03,015
Charles V of Germany
and master of India.

149
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:07,811
And that ...
India ...

150
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:12,024
I'm from Seville.

151
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,527
And this ...
This soil

152
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,738
And that, the sky.

153
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,326
And this ...

154
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:24,995
A plant.

155
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:26,914
And what else?
And what else?

156
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,042
This is sand ...

157
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,256
And in the distance, the horizon ...

158
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,386
And the sea

159
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:47,351
Somewhere.

160
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:50,646
Sea ..

161
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,359
Sea ..

162
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:00,906
"The sea was slack ...

163
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:03,742
full moon "

164
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:11,208
"A Moor born under this sign
do not lie "

165
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,461
When I was a child,
and adolescent

166
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:19,550
my mother ...

167
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:23,095
Me said:

168
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,722
telling lies,

169
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:28,475
it is a sorry.

170
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:32,729
"Question me, King,
for the truth, I tell you. "

171
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,524
I will tell you, sir,

172
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,776
even if it costs lives.

173
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:41,363
"If you wanted, Grenada ...

174
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,866
With you ...

175
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,578
I would marry. "

176
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:52,833
"And as dowry
I'd give Cordoba ...

177
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,793
And Seville "

178
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:57,129
"I'm married ...

179
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:00,132
King Don Juan ...

180
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:03,802
I am married and not widowed "

181
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:09,808
"And the Moor
I am the wife ...

182
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,106
Much good I wanted "

183
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,129
Hands.

184
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,304
My hands.

185
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:18,141
My hands.

186
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,950
The anchor. The anchor!

187
00:56:01,022 --> 00:56:03,722
What is the raft?

188
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,755
Who's in charge here?

189
00:56:24,842 --> 00:56:26,892
Alvar!

190
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,612
Here ends Spain.

191
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:20,321
Why did you leave me?

192
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,154
Since I have to condemn

193
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:27,572
I want to condemn me in peace!

194
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:31,579
You still disown your grandfather, Alvar.

195
00:57:32,337 --> 00:57:35,627
But there is no other way to win!

196
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:38,677
To have won the rabble

197
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:41,899
increased wealth of the crown

198
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:45,299
and paved the way for your priests,

199
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:48,751
I'm in hell!

200
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:52,028
I've burned!

201
01:07:43,578 --> 01:07:46,123
It is as dead as a stone.

202
01:07:47,082 --> 01:07:48,875
Hear me, Alvar.

203
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:16,236
Leave here.

204
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:19,990
You can do anything!

205
01:08:22,492 --> 01:08:24,035
Let's go!

206
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:27,581
He must go.

207
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:30,333
What are you doing?

208
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:09,414
She's dead as a stone.

209
01:09:17,214 --> 01:09:18,965
It feels the suffering here.

210
01:12:03,922 --> 01:12:05,382
What happens there, negro?

211
01:12:05,674 --> 01:12:06,299
Negro!

212
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,218
- It is here ...
- Who?

213
01:12:08,593 --> 01:12:10,178
The dead!

214
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,460
Death is here ...

215
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:08,388
The death ...

216
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:35,165
It is a musket ball ...

217
01:19:41,838 --> 01:19:47,552
- You do not resurrected?
- No, Alonso.

218
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:54,392
He ...

219
01:19:54,392 --> 01:19:56,394
We can not revive it.

220
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,397
Better stop talking
resurrections.

221
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:03,026
It may reach
Christian lands.

222
01:20:12,744 --> 01:20:14,371
If you tell what has been experienced,

223
01:20:14,996 --> 01:20:16,414
we believe you mad.

224
01:20:18,542 --> 01:20:22,629
We will kill you.
They lock you up.

225
01:20:23,004 --> 01:20:27,050
You come home in Spain
covered with chains.

226
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,012
Is that a threat?

227
01:20:31,304 --> 01:20:35,100
No, this is not a threat.

228
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,770
This is what awaits you!

229
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:12,304
We'll have ...

230
01:21:14,222 --> 01:21:16,600
Telling lies.

231
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:52,232
Alonso!

232
01:24:54,484 --> 01:24:55,694
There!

233
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:24,014
We are Christians.

234
01:25:24,598 --> 01:25:27,392
Servants of Her Majesty!

235
01:25:39,946 --> 01:25:41,031
We are soldiers.

236
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:42,073
Like you!

237
01:25:46,369 --> 01:25:47,704
Mr. Cabeza de Vaca

238
01:25:49,122 --> 01:25:50,957
is the treasurer of the expedition.

239
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:55,378
It was wrecked in Florida!

240
01:25:57,923 --> 01:25:58,799
Pray!

241
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:02,552
Mr. Cabeza is the treasurer
shipment.

242
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:07,808
What a day ...

243
01:26:11,061 --> 01:26:12,229
Are we?

244
01:26:14,564 --> 01:26:17,234
What day is it?

245
01:26:39,256 --> 01:26:41,007
178 captain.

246
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:45,637
We need more,
80 more at least.

247
01:26:46,888 --> 01:26:48,181
My God, what's that?

248
01:26:48,598 --> 01:26:50,976
The treasurer of the expedition
de Narváez.

249
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:53,311
A Christian dressed as ...

250
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:55,730
We see these things here ...

251
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:01,069
Treasurer, we construct
a cathedral.

252
01:27:01,445 --> 01:27:05,657
The captain is counting on you
to find her slaves.

253
01:27:06,116 --> 01:27:07,909
Your Indian love you,

254
01:27:08,493 --> 01:27:09,453
you won

255
01:27:09,494 --> 01:27:10,954
esteem.

256
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:16,460
Mille ... five hundred ...

257
01:27:18,503 --> 01:27:21,339
half ... six ... Year ...

258
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:35,353
Eight years!

259
01:27:36,396 --> 01:27:38,732
Eight years ...

260
01:27:57,667 --> 01:28:00,295
Your request ...

261
01:28:01,379 --> 01:28:04,966
Offense more faith

262
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:09,304
it offends my ...

263
01:28:10,514 --> 01:28:11,765
What faith are you talking about?

264
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:16,686
From this, or ours
faith of Spain?

265
01:28:17,395 --> 01:28:18,855
The only one.

266
01:28:21,066 --> 01:28:22,484
Faith.

267
01:28:25,278 --> 01:28:28,323
Spain ...
This is Spain.

268
01:28:32,452 --> 01:28:33,453
This ...

269
01:28:36,623 --> 01:28:38,041
This is ...

270
01:28:41,545 --> 01:28:42,838
Spain!

271
01:28:48,802 --> 01:28:51,388
That captain

272
01:28:52,848 --> 01:28:54,391
is ... Spain.

273
01:28:58,645 --> 01:29:02,357
Your Justice
I have seen at work

274
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:07,320
on all roads
of this land.

275
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:09,823
This land ...

276
01:29:14,494 --> 01:29:16,413
It is eight years.

277
01:29:17,372 --> 01:29:19,291
Eight years.

278
01:29:22,961 --> 01:29:26,006
Three, four, eight ...

279
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:40,437
Put this man under guard!

280
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,856
We are soldiers!

281
01:29:43,482 --> 01:29:44,858
Health!

282
01:29:47,694 --> 01:29:49,112
You have to see,
things these years!

283
01:29:51,907 --> 01:29:52,783
Indeed.

284
01:29:52,908 --> 01:29:54,367
Tell us.

285
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,369
You have seen cities of gold?

286
01:29:59,247 --> 01:30:01,625
These eyes have seen.

287
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:07,714
Big and yellow.

288
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:12,844
From such brilliance that I was dazzled
for two days.

289
01:30:15,013 --> 01:30:16,223
Temples,

290
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:20,560
The streets and houses ...
Everything was solid gold!

291
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,482
Cities of Gold ...

292
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:32,114
You were a prisoner?

293
01:30:33,865 --> 01:30:35,075
Few days.

294
01:30:36,201 --> 01:30:38,787
I was paired with Indian
with three breasts.

295
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:41,039
Three tits?

296
01:30:41,164 --> 01:30:43,166
Besides that,
they were voters.

297
01:30:48,964 --> 01:30:50,924
Women with three ...

298
01:30:55,387 --> 01:30:56,888
Boobs.

299
01:31:08,108 --> 01:31:09,025
In this city,

300
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:14,906
gave me a witch
ointment pestilential.

301
01:31:15,949 --> 01:31:19,286
We will pass on the stick,
and an hour later,

302
01:31:19,828 --> 01:31:22,539
you fuck with the force
twenty asses together!

303
01:31:24,124 --> 01:31:25,417
You do not believe me, eh?

304
01:31:29,546 --> 01:31:32,549
These cities, Dorantes
where are they?

305
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:34,509
Yes, where are they?

306
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:35,969
These cities?

307
01:31:38,805 --> 01:31:40,599
My Cities of Gold.

308
01:31:43,852 --> 01:31:46,062
Eternal youth

309
01:31:49,024 --> 01:31:50,692
Rivers liquorice

310
01:31:51,943 --> 01:31:53,612
female golden

311
01:31:55,572 --> 01:31:58,325
manna as sweet
that milk fell from the sky ...

312
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,454
I know where they are
these cities.

313
01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:04,039
Go, tell us.

314
01:32:06,666 --> 01:32:09,252
There, in the north!

315
01:32:15,759 --> 01:32:18,512
Tell lies ...

316
01:32:21,389 --> 01:32:22,766
Like them ...

317
01:32:25,685 --> 01:32:27,145
Estebanico ...

318
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,151
Why we do not say
truth?

319
01:32:51,837 --> 01:32:53,088
It Araino!

320
01:32:54,339 --> 01:32:57,259
- Where are you?
- Sir!

321
01:33:02,973 --> 01:33:05,350
Stop!

322
01:33:10,647 --> 01:33:11,898
What have you done?

323
01:33:12,482 --> 01:33:14,484
Let them, bastards!
There is nothing to be learned.

324
01:33:14,609 --> 01:33:15,902
Son of a bitch!

325
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:38,133
Why?

326
01:34:10,123 --> 01:34:11,958
Why?

327
01:38:24,294 --> 01:38:29,591
For Reload-Paradise
