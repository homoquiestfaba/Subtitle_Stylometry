326
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,154
Huh?
Anything.

327
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,158
Okay.
You reaIize that's
where we are, right?

328
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,578
It's that bad?

329
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,665
We run a company together.
Jesus Christ, where
the heII are you?

330
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,500
Wait.
Uh, I thought
we were doing okay.

331
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,836
We were doing okay
in the '90s.

332
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,339
Not so much now.
We're going to have to start
Iaying peopIe off again.

333
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,716
No, no.

334
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,762
<i>So, they thought</i>

to just be I BS.

336
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,435

00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,331
Um, why don't we get
to your idea?

343
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,836
Um, I want a taIk show
with me as the host.

344
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,383
Okay. WeII, it wouIdn't, uh,
be our first foray

345
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,302
into vanity programming.
That's true.

346
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,638
Last year we did
that hobby show.

347
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,556

That's crazy.

350
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,981

Yeah.
I want aII that.

357

AII these things
add up

358
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:41,257
to making creating your own show
extremeIy expensive.

359
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,926
Yeah, particuIarIy when
you're not offsetting
those costs

360
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,095

from seIIing products.

00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:52,059
How much

364
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,228
Two hours.

365
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,522
You're Iooking

It's more Iike 1 50.

or we start
Iaying peopIe off again.

380
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,850
Have you thought about
how this is going to affect
the other brands?

381
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,853
<i>Well, Live Alchemy</i>
hasn't turned a profit
in two and a haIf years.

382
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,357
Same with
<i>Viva Ceramica, San Tropez,</i>

WouId it make you feeI better
if you were eating, too?

390
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,316
This eating
is not working for me.

391
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,735
The food is distracting
from the work.

392
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,738
I have to eat because
of my new reIationship
with gIucose.

393
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,658
AII right.
You can have
a snack at five of two

and another one
at 2:50.

395

PIease stop eating
in session.

396
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:27,673
So, Iike Oprah,
but with a swan boat.

397
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,426
TaIk show.
Uh-huh.

398
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,177

WeII, how about
a IittIe recap?

402
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,605
In case you missed
Iast week's episode
<i>of the Alice Klieg Show--</i>

403
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,399
That's not
what it's caIIed.

00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,193
That's not
the name of it.

405
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,865
You're off your meds,
you just spent $1 5 miIIion,

you're Iiving
in a reservation casino,

407
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:56,910
and you're hosting
your own taIk show.

408
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,250
I thought I asked you
not to eat.

409
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,543
It's a banana.

410
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,797
It's in its own container.

411
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,467

412
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,801

And then I taIk
about myseIf.

415
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:36,575
Is there a show that's
kind of Iike what you want

416

<i>Oprah.</i>

417
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,163
So, maybe
we shouId watch
some oId Oprahs

418
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:44,833
and pay speciaI attention
to how each show
has a topic.

419
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,169
I have a topic.
Which is?

420
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,421
Me.

421
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,092
What does that mean?
You know,
just what I Iove.

422
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,511
My hopes, my dreams.
What I Iike to eat.

423
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,223
Who I think is a cunt.
My spirituaIity.
